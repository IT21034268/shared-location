5,3 yr old boys love it!,"My boys are both three and they both really enjoy playing with their ""letters"". I wanted them to be able to recognize both upper case and lower case letters. This board is perfect! The pictures behind the letters add even more stimulation to the puzzle. Great gift for my boys!"
4,Some minor critiques,"I have been looking for a good set of upper and lower case letters for my son. I wanted a set like this one so he could recognize both together. For the most part, this set it great. Nice and colorful. Seems durable enough, my son hasn't been able to break any of the pieces (yet).I only have a couple minor complaints. First, the lower case d and p are almost identical, even the same color. It would have been nice if they were different colors. Also, the lowercase i looks very similar to the lowercase l. There is very little distinction around the dot on the i.Other than that, the set is adequate for what it's for. My 18 month old son can identify all of the uppercase letters and nearly all of the lowercase letters thanks to this toy."
5,Twin girls can easily share this toy!,"I am a stay home mother to twin girls, who is also homeschooling. This puzzle is great! So much so, that I am buying more products by this company (Lights, Camera, Interaction, Inc.). The pieces are easy for a toddler/preschool child to handle, and they stimulate their imagination as well. My girls are happily entertained for 30-45 minutes with these toys."
2,"Good concept, poor execution","As cool as I thought this puzzle was, it isn't. The holes for the letters are very shallow, and they fall out if barely even bumped. And, the actual letters themselves aren't very defined, like the ""m"" and ""w"". Those two are tricky enough for a toddler, and this puzzle doesn't make it any easier. I would go for another puzzle."
4,Good Alphabet Puzzle,"It's well made. The cute pictures behind the letters are a surprise treat. You have to put the capital letters in first and then the lower case letters color match the capitols. This is not so much a complaint as an acknowledgement that there is some ambiguity in English lower case letters. Is this a ""b"" or a ""q"" depends on how you hold it. This is however confusing for a small child. This is a complaint. How come ""S"" will only go in the puzzle one way instead of two ? I'm afraid my grand-daughter is going to damage the puzzle by jamming on it instead of rotating the puzzle piece 180 degrees, cause it almost goes the wrong way. The picture under the w is presumably a wagon. In fact that is a Hansom cab. Good job overall. My 3 year old grand-daughter is enjoying it. See link for wagon picture.[..]"
5,Good learning tool,My grandson already knew his capital letters so this puzzle is a great way for him to learn his lower case letters also.
4,"Shows wear, letters only fit in the correct spot","This puzzle could be made more durable. The letters are already showing wear around the edges.Also, the lower case letters aren't made great for learning.In my opinion, the lower case ""p"" and ""d"" should fit in both spots...as well as, lower case ""u"" and ""n""...this has been frustrating for my boy and for me.It's still a great product!"
3,I had higher expectations,"I had higher expectations for this puzzle. The quality is not as nice as some others they make. We've had it 2 days and some of the stickers on the letters are peeling up. This thing is just poor quality construction, I wish they would go back to the painted stuff. Also, some of the letters are VERY hard to tell apart. The lower case q and a are almost identical, the lower case d and p are confusing, and the lower case i and l almost fit in each other's spots. It's hard for me to tell the difference in them so it's really tough for my 3 year old daughter."
4,very shallow pieces,"This puzzle is good from an educational standpoint; my 2 year old is learning both upper and lower case letters and enjoys holding and manipulating them individually. The letters are simply letters, rather than adorned with distracting images (although some letters, like lower case q, don't really look like the letters they are supposed to be). However, the puzzle pieces and the wells they sit in are very shallow. This makes it hard to keep everything in place unless the puzzle is held/carried perfectly horizontally. I'm also concerned that the letters will break before my newborn is old enough to play with them."
3,Letters are not realistic,"I was very excited to get my son this puzzle to help him learn both the lower and upper case letters of the alphabet. However, some of the lower case letters do not look as I think they should. I should have paid closer attention to the picture of the puzzle before ordering it, but now that we have it I see that the lower case ""q"" and ""a"" look almost identical; the lower case ""b"" and ""d"" do not have long enough stems; and the upper case ""N"" is too fat. Also, the dots above the lower case ""i"" and ""j"" are too hard to distinguish. I love how there are pictures under the pieces. I just wish the letters had been carved better."
1,Hatchet Job,I bought this book to read about Joe Hooper. What I got was a hatchet job on Sergeant Hooper's time in Vietnam and his life. I can't imagine why authors Maslowski and Winslow would go to such lengths to defame an American soldier.
2,A watch that does not work. What kind of a gift is that?,"I gave this as a Christmas gift. The owner called to tell me that the watch was not working. She also said the instructions that were sent with the watch did not match the one she actually had. She had to bring it to a repair shop and pay to have the repairman take the watch apart to put new batteries inside. Because of the way the watch is built, she has to always pay extra to have someone take it apart to replace the batteries. Some gift... I was so disgusted with this process. I will not order any more watches from Amazon."
3,Collaborative Learning Techniques,"As a recently hired college instructor, I wanted to develop my skills in collaborative learning. This book provides a good, comprehensive introduction to the topic, with examples and helpful hints. However, most of the information is available free on internet sites. The book is good as an easily used, single reference, rather than having to deal with multiple internet sites. I would recommend it."
4,Good rack,"Solid, solid basic rack. Works perfectly with the Topeak trunk bags.Relatively light weight and rated to hold up to 55 pounds."
4,Nostalgic fun,"I remember this from when I was a kid and recently bought a copy. I use this in my English class to show how things have changed since 1960. This book assumes that every kid over age 6 has a pocket knife and shows us how to sharpen it, whittle with it, and even cut shapes out of empty walnut shells. Imagine how many kids lost fingers thanks to Mr. Hunt. If you're really ambitious you can go kill a cow, prepare the hide, and sew up some mocassins. Or you can catch butterflies in you home made net and kill those suckers with cancer-causing chemicals. Definitely from a simpler time in American history, there are no warnings or cautions in this book; back then it was assumed that parents wanted their sons to have b**ls."
2,not bad built cheap,"bike was ok. lots of cheap plastic parts. bike needs professional to assemble. rear gear cluster is loose on mine, dont want to waste time getting a ""warrenty"" will ride until it breaks."
2,Kent Sierra Madre Men's Comfort Bike,"My recommendation is to avoid this product because of poor quality control, turning what could be an excellent bike into a junky, problematic one. The greatest positive of this bike is that it's attractive in a low-key fashion, however, even that positive was marred by scratches in the pearly-white finish of the fork crown and a blistereddecorative decal on the downtube, from friction from the brake handle during shipping, because of inadequate packaging. Another reviewer hasreported the same damage on the downtube of her women's version of theSierra Madre.I will add more detail to this review as I can make time available. In the meantime beware of Kent bicycles, as I have in the meantime purchased another bicycle by Kent and discovered even greater junkiness."
5,Buy this one!,"This is a great album, but please do not take Moshes advise. Buy this one, not the two on one. The two on one does not sound that great and the artwork is not good. If you are a true ARA fan, buy Stacked Deck and Too Stuffed to Jump seperate!"
4,misty eyed,Despite the sound quality being a little dodgy this is one of the great albums of all time. I have to admit i got a little misty eyed when I listened to Dancin the Night Away. The only version I had was a well worn tape recorded from a well worn LP so This is what I have been waiting for. I know there are a lot of great contemporary acts around but you can't beat the classics.
5,Shipping Made the Difference,"What can I say? If you knew the Amazing Rhythm Aces and liked them, then the only review is: Did the CDs come as described?.. YES. I could not tell the difference between new and these used ones and the shipping that was estimated at possibly 3 weeks only took about 4 days.Expensive albums, but I knew that when I ordered them. Both albums, Stacked Deck and Too Stuffed to Jump were purchased through Amazon.com but came from ""carnack53""[...]If I get the urge to buy any more old and out of print CDs to replace my old, lost or damaged LP records, I'll check Amazon again to see if they are available from carnack53."
2,Too Stuffed to Jump,Two tracks had skips. Album looked great....both cover and vinyl... but with skips it is unacceptable. It was rated much higher than it should have been given the skips. The album is a great musical score...too bad for the skips!!!!
4,"Important, original work...","This is something of keynote work in traditional Seneca stories. The author -- Arthur C. Parker -- was a Seneca author from New York State who became a well-known ehtnologist, and contributed a great deal based on his first-hand perspective of his own People. (He was the nephew of Ely S. Parker, Seneca Sachem and Union Aide to Ulysses S Grant). The language, indicative of scholarship of the time, can be somewhat stiff and formalized, but the Stories and their relevance are critically important."
5,A great read,"I was hesitant to read this, still having the bad taste in my mouth from trying to read the Left Behind series. This book, as well as its prequel The Last Disciple, are exciting reads that don't hit you over the head with the author's personal interpretations ever few lines."
3,The Last Sacrifice,Very interesting book of this period of time after the crucifiction of Christ and the persecution of the early Christians.
4,A good read,"I liked this book as well as the first of the series (The Last Disciple). As I said in my review of The Last Disciple, it provides both a good read (not as good as The Last Disciple in my opinion) and makes the preterist's view of end-times a compelling alternative to the futurist view taken in the Left Behind series.BTW: At the time of this post, I haven't heard anything about the next book (the third one) in the series....but this book (book two) really left me wanting for the next one."
1,Roman drama,The is the second book to the The Last Disciple which I didn't like. I didn't like this one any better. It's still the horrible details of Rome. I also thought that by the end of this book we'd have closure of Vitas and Sophia. But we don't. They plan to drag it out for one more book.
4,Pre-Beatles British Pop,"I was a 13 year old in Bombay when this flick came out. I didn't realize what a large hit it had been in England until I read the liner notes for the dvd. But Cliff Richard was huge in India and England at the time. The movie was an event. Part MGM style musical, part teenage heartthrob pic. The only real 'rock' performance came in the final scene - ""We Say Yeah!"" In 1963 this was edgy, rebellious stuff to us and ""The Shadows"" were right up there with ""The Ventures"" as an instrumental band. Well produced. Good performance by Robert Morely as the villain who wants to raze the teen club to build a high rise. Brings pre-Beatle era London to life. A fun look back."
2,The preface sums up the book,"In the preface the author says that the book isn't meant to me a Grand Unified Theory of history. That it isn't, but I get the feeling that the first draft was meant to be and that the preface was subsequently written to state the obvious failure. The first three chapters are good. The rest is an arbitrariliy arranged collection of occasionally interesting facts mixed with poorly argued conclusions. I'm not an academic, but even I found the last two chapters (especially the one on the modern world) almost laughable in the breadth and shallowness of it's argument."
1,DISAPPOINTED !!!,WATCH WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT. IT WAS DEFECTIVE AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR A REPLACEMENT. WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR AGAIN.
2,not impressed,"i was really disappointed by this movie. It was just not my type of movie. If you are into cop movies and hard core violence, then you will like this. There was a rape scene, and 2 pregnant women got killed. Totally turned me off..and I am a hard core Robin Shou fan. Extrememly disappointed...plot very hard to follow at first. Wouldn't recommend it."
4,"A Good ""Get to Know Me"" Choice","While patently not a training manual (and it does not claim to be) this book is something you should own if you're going to bring a Lab into your life. The book has lots of historical information on the breed, breed characteristics, and health issues which any Lab owner will find interesting and helpful. The book is particularly apt for those who have yet to purchase their lab, but are interested or have committed to taking a pup from a litter. Read it before hand, cover to cover, and you'll know more about where to find a pup, how to choose it, and what to expect when you get home. Oh, and the pics are great.You should, however, buy a separate training manual -- even if you plan to use a professional trainer (which I recommend) a training manual will help you get through those first weeks/months before obedience classes start."
5,Great book for the new Labrador owner.,This is a wonderful book for any Labrador enthusiast. One of the most easy to read and up to date Labrador books on the market. I recommend this book to all new puppy owners. This is one you wont want to be without.
4,THE GOOD OLD DAYS,"I just recently saw the condensed version of Davy Crockett. It brought back a lot of memories of a simpler time. It is a very clean, and fairly accurate version of what happened 200 years ago. It is enough to introduce the little people to some of our history in a way that keeps their attention.It is tragic that they chopped 3 one hour programs down into ninety minutes total. They should have keept it all in there, or released each program individually. Is there any chance the lost parts can be restored?"
3,"davy crockett, king of the wild frontier",This is the video of the theatrical release of the movie which is an abridged version of the three episodes originally shown on TV. Disney should release the 3 original TV episodes as a video.
2,Season Didn't Get Any Better...,"Well...sets 1 through 4 are still the best.See my review for Box set 5 - it should explain what I think of the second season of Space:1999.One thing I will credit them, they did have some interesting props. Oh well."
4,Great Book,"Great Book with lots of useful information. Would have liked a few more paddle designs, but overall, great book."
1,misleading,"I was excited to find a book on crafting canoe paddles only to be let down by the lack of information a reader would expect. The author writes of forms, jigs, and tools that he has built for shaping canoe paddles but fails to explain or show how to make these items. This book gives the history of canoe paddles and misses quite a bit of information that is helpful for the build. There is also a lack of clear or detailed pictures and absolutely no color pictures. This book is great for the coffee table but less effective if you want a step by step on the paddle building process. There is also no mention of wrapping the finished paddles with fiberglass as do many paddle makers. (e.g. watch the construction video on whiskeyjack paddles website)."
3,this book is fine,I liked how this book provides an overall idea about the screenprinting techniques but it's definitely not something very very detailed for someone who wants the nitty gritty details about all techniques.
2,Poor organization,"There is some good information in this book but it is poorly organized. Sections seem to jump around sometimes leaving out important information, but wait, there it is a couple of pages later. The book needs a good editor and complete redesign. I found it frustrating to tease out the information I needed. Good luck on the next edition."
1,Useless for small studio-based artists.,"This book presents water-based silskcreening as if it were somehow revolutionary and new. It isn't.For a home-based artist, the book is almost useless. It explains the use of equipment I will never own and doesn't provide the technical information or DIY tips about registration and studio setup that I need."
1,Product not as advertised,"This product description states that the item includes 3 yoyos and a dvd. In actuality, the only thing included in this item is a video cassette."
3,Misleading Title,"As an entomologist living in the United States and interested in identifying grasshoppers etc. I was pleased to see this book published. However, despite claiming to cover 'the United States' it does not. Alaska is absent. I'm sure the publishers don't mind the extra money from those wouldn't have bought the book if the title had said 'contiguous United States'."
4,Jacky WU IS THAT DUDE,"Jacky Wu is the man this movie was really good. The end was a little to dramatic for me, but overall I enjoyed the movie. The fight he has to throw was good, so was the one in that fancy room with the brother from Flash point. One of my favorite dragon dynasty titles worth checking out."
2,meh,"Ok so this is like porn. They get right down to business. Which is great and what I want when I want to watch fighting. The acting is terrible. There is some really bada*s fighting for sure... but the last 30-45 minutes of the movie has no fighting at all, just this retarded badly done emotional crap. I would have rated it better if there was fighting all the way until the end"
3,Not good as Bloodsport but good as Lionheart.,"If you are looking for cool action-packed martial arts movie set in a tournament or a martial arts movie with many international fighing styles then this one is not for you.This is very alike to the movie Lionheart starring Van Damme. Is about clandestine fights set in different parts of the dark city with an emotional story. Like Lionheart, is a mix of action and drama with some good fight scenes and a dark storyline. There are a total of 5 or 6 fight scenes, they are pretty fast but most of them are not so long for you to enjoy, most of the character's fighting styles are pretty much the same, and sometimes the story can get a little boring.When I watched this movie I was expecting something like Bloodsport, in other words: many different fighting styles, many fights, less talk and more action. Now, if you like movies like Lionheart of maybe Damage starring Stonecold then you can give this one a chance.Adios."
2,Mixed-result Fighting Scenes + It's mainly a kung-fu drama + Stiff Acting of Main Female = Worth renting,"The fighting scenes are both very good and very bad. It's very good because Jacky Wu Jing is so skillful at martial art. It's very bad because his opponents are so incompetent. Consequently, when Wu Jing attacks or moves, it's gripping. When his opponents counter attack or block his moves, it looks so fake that all the excitement is gone. On the opposite, the fights between Wu Jing and Donnie Yen in SPL/Kill Zone are exciting and suspenseful. It's because both opponents possess equal skills.This is mainly a drama with a kung fu background. The plot is supposed to be touching but it does not move me. It's because the acting of the main female actress is so stiff.In short, it's worth renting but not buying."
5,A Gem of Comfort,"Sheltering Thoughts is a gem!! This little book brings great comfort and hope to those who mourn. Turn to any page and find an uplifting thought or something to hold onto in a time of grief and loss. When you just don't know what to do to help someone who has lost a loved one, give this book."
4,I'll Take You There,"I had never heard of this movie but it sounded interesting after reading the cover and I like Ally Sheedy. It was such a pleasant surprise! I laughed, I cried and I cringed, but it was very original and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'd highly recommend it. I will be purchasing it to add to my collection."
1,"Sadly, one of Carpenter's worst.","I usually enjoy the director's films and Amber Heard is fun and gorgeous.. but this film just does not work. The story is lame, the 'scares' are ridiculously stupid, and the characters are very stale. Avoid this one and check out some much better horror that's out there."
2,trite ending after tiresome buildup,shalaman ish trite ending supposed to maek up for tiresoem rest fo mvoie and amin actresse is not hot at all overly skinny n flat yekk
5,Another winner from John Carpenter!,"The first thing I have to confess is that I THOUGHT I knew how this film would end, but was totally surprised at what I had actually been watching (no, I won't give it away, either!) The acting is first-rate and while there is very little gore, the psychological impact of the flick left me thinking that, ""yes, John Carpenter has still got it!""If you are not a fan of John Carpenter's work, you most likely will be after, ""The Ward""! I""m looking forward to getting the DVD for the bonus features, too."
5,the haunting,"It's great to see John Carpenter coming back. Waiting for the dvd release, I had the pleasure of watching the film in theaters, and I was more than happy to realise that I was right in feeling that there is a huge gap between the horror movies of John and the ones that are produced in excess today. Carpenter's horror-as also Polanski's-was never an end itself, but it carried a cerain regard of life and the world in general, and that is what made his movies so influential. Here we have an extraordinary example of a movie made to haunt. With a dreamy feeling and a claustophobic atmosphere that grabs you, John Carpenter's The Ward is simply the greatest horror movie you've watched for many years, and in the tradition of Repulsion and Assault on K13-combining a feeling of both-it is destined to be a classic.Say hello to the Master(not only of horror, but of cinema in general)!Welcome back ,and I can hardly wait for the next project.John Carpenter over all!"
3,CARPENTER GOES CRAZY,"What made John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN such a classic was his ability to draw on our basic fear of the dark and the boogeyman. On a shoestring budget, Carpenter used that innate fear without loads of gore or campy special effects.THE WARD is Carpenter's first film since the disastrous GHOST OF MARS, and it does have some of Carpenter's finesse and style. The film has a creepy and ominous setting, and Carpenter uses this setting effectively. Going into the plot might include spoilers, so I'll just admit I didn't see the plot twist coming.The acting is quite good: Amber Heard as our heroine Kristen gives a strong, controlled performance; Mammie Gummer (Meryl Streep's daughter) and Danielle Pannabaker give strong support and Jared Harris is very good as the resolute doctor.THE WARD is not Carpenter's best but it proves he still has the talent to create good thrillers. Let's hope he finds the right script to use his expertise."
5,Worth the watch,"Pretty good movie, worth the watch.. amber health is gorgeous and has an unexpected outcome.. 4 and a half stars."
3,The Ward,Received the bluray in less than 2 weeks. Not really a great movie like I thought It would be. Still miss some of John Carpenter's other classics.
4,the ward,"This was a good creepy film. You got your girl who is taken to a mental hospitial, meets her 4 other mates on the ward who are all interesting and cool in their own way and then next thing you know, they are getting killed by a ghost. There's the creepy staff who act like they don't know anything and some spooks here and there. It's enjoyable though, if you seen the film Identity,then near the end of the film you will get the truth behind it all like that. If you did not watch Identity, then i did not spoil it for you. I liked the old school feel of the film. It wasn't all special effects that made the film, the acting was strong and real. The ghost was scary and who she is went very well with the plot and secret of the movie."
4,John Carpenter's THE WARD,I am an old John Carpenter fan and all though this is not his best it is certainly not his worst film. Even you don't know John Carpenter I highly recommend this film to you. Do see it. Great little film with great Actresses.
3,"Should say ""Natural wood COLOR"" - Not real wood.","I was surprised and disappointed to find that this is made of particle board, (the fine particle board that feels cardboard-ish) not wood. So if it gets wet, it will warp, and it will crack much easier than real wood. In fact, mine arrived with a small, but long crack all along one edge. It was fixable with glue, but does not bode well for the durability of this product. However, I will waterproof it, and hopefully that will prolong its life. It will, however show dings and damage more readily than real wood.However, I am happy to have a shelf to keep my kids tabbed wooden puzzles on. I just thought that it would be wood, as it says it is, and so would look nicer in the family room."
2,Not all puzzles fit...,I was disappointed to find that the chunky block wooden puzzles do not fit in the puzzle box only the flatter wooden puzzles. Had I realized this I would not have bought it.
2,Look Otherwise for Puzzle Storage,"I have many Melissa and Doug puzzles for my 15 month old and thought this would be a great idea...well, buyer beware. It looks cheap, not ""real wood look"" and my kid's puzzles DON'T FIT. I was very disappointed to say the least. I wish I had done better homework!"
2,Not for Chuuky Puzzles and warped,"I was shocked by the quality of this case given how much we love all our daughter's Melissa & Doug puzzles and toys. The top and bottom were warped as if they had been exposed to elements, and the case only fit one of her puzzles, none of her Chunky Puzzles, which was the main purpose for the purchase. I love Melissa & Doug and was very disappointed. Not only was it not useful for us, and the quality was surprisingly poor, but the cost for what it is is very high. These products are otherwise always more than reasonable."
2,NATURAL??? Wood Puzzle,"I wish I had read the reviews first! Just received the ""Natural Wood"" Puzzle Storage Case that is made from pressed wood. Not at all what is advertised as ""Solid-Wood Construction"". I would not have purchased this otherwise. First time I've ever been disappointed with Melissa & Doug."
1,Fell apart immediatly,We just got this today as a gift. My son loves puzzles and we needed storage for them so he can get them out himself. We have one case already that's similar so I thought this one would be fine but it LITERALLY fell to pieces the MINUTE the shrink wrap came off. None of the glue held and apparently it wasn't held together with anything else. Now I have a pile of pieces and have to go back to the person who gave it to us to figure out how to get a replacement. This is NOT the quality I expect from Melissa & Doug.
2,doesn't fit!,"This box would be perfect--except that it doesn't fit the Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles! It only fits a handful of puzzle manufactured by the company, which is very frustrating."
2,Chunky puzzles don't fit,The chunky melissa and doug puzzles don't fit in here - you have to lift the pieces that are near the edges up off the puzzle and then it will slide in however that makes it taller so you won't be able to fit the same amount of puzzles in there heighth wise. The standard puzzle where the pieces have a little knob to pull on seem to work just fine. I was surprised that M&D would make this product when it doesn't fit their own popular chunky puzzles. Odd.
1,Doesn't fit puzzles!,"First of all, I Love Melissa and Doug products. I have purchased many puzzles for my 18 month old son and I love how the basic puzzles have large knobs for little hands to grab. However, when I purchased this puzzle sorter I just assumed that all Melissa and Doug puzzles would fit on a Melissa and Doug Puzzle storage case. When I received this product I found that not a single puzzle will fit in the case! Bummer."
2,"Wouldn't call it ""Deluxe Natural Wood"" -- more like Cardboard-Box Brown Particle Board","Received this today and am very disappointed. I was planning to put it on a shelf in our family room/living room which has a natural wood grain, but it looks like it's made of cardboard... very ugly & cheap looking. Definitely not the light wood color from the photo. Is this a new development? I only see one other review (from yesterday, in fact) that mentions that it's particle board. I could understand particle board with a laminated layer or something, but the particle board looks unfinished and like it might start to peel/flake. I don't know where the ""Deluxe"" fits in either. I'm trying to decide whether it's worth keeping and painting, or whether I should just return it. It's also dented on the back. I always thought Melissa & Doug had better quality than this. I've always liked the puzzles."
2,Puzzle Storage Box Doesn't Fit Melissa and Doug Chunky Puzzles,"I'm quite disappointed that I bought this puzzle storage box for my 2-year old grandson for Christmas. He loves puzzles and has 4 or 5 Melissa and Dave puzzles. HOWEVER, he has the chunky wooden puzzles and none of them will fit in the puzzle storage box without taking the pieces out of them. This completely defeats the purpose of having a puzzle storage box."
1,Not real wood,"This is not made of solid wood, it's pressed particle board. The construction was incredibly poor and it didn't fit the usual size Melissa and Doug puzzles. I couldn't believe they put their name on it. We returned it. Definitely not worth the money!"
5,GO EAGLES!,"I love the jersey , thank you very much, I love watching dawkins slam people into the dirt"
4,SummerSlam 1988,"The best matches on the card were the opening tag team match between The British Bulldogs & The Fabulous Rougeaus which was a exciting and solid match despite the disappointing lack of finish and the Tag Team Championship match between Demolition & The Hart Foundation which was good for a tag team bout. The worst match was the main event tag team match between The Mega Powers(Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage) & The Mega Bucks(Ted Dibase & Andre The Giant) which was predictably one-dimensional and abysmal. The Ultimate Warrior's victory over The Honky Tonk Man for the Intercontinental title was genuinely captivating. Miss Elizabeth's distraction was the only good & memorable thing about the tag team main event. Infact without Warrior's title win & Miss Elizabeth's surprise finish, this was a totally forgettable event. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10."
4,Honky Tonk- you idiot!Did you think you could beat Warrior?!,"THe funniest thing I've ever seen in Wrestling history. Please!All the matches were good, yet Honky Tonk shoots off his mouth, ""Pick anybody..i dont care"".Are you insane? What if it was Earthquake? Spalsh and a super sit.....hes goneOr Andre? Super Mega Head Butt...and hes gone in 5 seconds.....But Warrior beat him to a pulp...hahaha...However, Warrior didnt cleanly Gorilla press/drop Honky Tonk..and when he wentagainst the ropes to splash im, Honky had to ""position"" himself....how fake. He was out of place....and he quickly so called woke up to reposition himself...hahahahastill...hilarious.....I wish it was Andre though. Sit on him Andre."
2,"Not Very ""Tex Mex""","The recipes may produce some tasty dishes, but you really need to be in New Mexico to work with this cookbook as it calls for New Mexico style green chiles and the types of dried chile powder found in New Mexico.Not really a Tex Mex book, in my opinion. I've lived in Texas all my life and even the Tex Mex section recipes look strange to my eye."
3,Fairly good recipes,"This isn't a very thick cookbook, but it has some tasty recipes. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves Tex mex flavors."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"This book disappointed in the first few pages, and didn't get any better. I was really put off when the author described a weapon that does not exist in the military aresenal (..""the 30-30 carbine..""). If he made this up, I can only assume that he made up other parts of this story. A big disappointment. Mr. Batson should take up a different hobby."
4,"Great Spice, just not overly spicy","This overall is one of my favorite spices. It goes well in almost all dishes where either a hot spice, chili or black pepper would be included. Used in moderation, it adds a wonderful flavor. Used generously, adds a pleasant heat, similar to a microwave set to low in your mouth.Pros: Flavorful spice that goes well with most foods, including soul food, Cajun, Southwest, Mexican, Indian or good ol' American.Cons: Not overly hot. For most people, yes, it is hot but it certainly doesn't stand up to the Habanero name.Again, if you are looking for a favorful addition to your food, this is the spice you are looking for. If you just want something to make your best friend's eyes water, look for an extract."
2,Not what I expected!,I was expecting more of a red savina powder. When I popped the lid it might as well have been straight chili powder. Its probably fine if thats what you want but its definitley not what I thought it was going to be.
4,First time meeting Harold Jaffe,I had not and still have not read anything by Harold Jaffebut he has a small but dedicated group of fans and readers.In this book Jaffe is placed on a lofty pillar by writers whoplace him amongst the most important current writers. On mynext Amazon purchase I promise to order a book by Jaffe. Youshould too.
5,Best Game for Masochists,"This is for some odd reason my favorite game. It may be because it's a game I can beat all my friends at, or because it's a truly challenging, amazing game. I rate it 4 stars for fun because at time, when the levels get higher and higher, I start hating the game and myself for not being able to beat it. But, if you want a great game to play with friends that enjoy video games, GET THIS!"
5,I'd almost forgotten this treasure. Shame on me.,"What a wonderful gem of a book, full of wit, charm, and adventure. It reminds us how life SHOULD be led. I'd delighted to have found it again. Do not, I repeat, do not miss it."
5,I agree with Sally! Not written for the male population ...,"Charming adventure story to be treasured by boys AND girls. Dominic may be masculine, but his approach to life and discovery are good examples for both sexes, and some of his actions show characteristics commonly credited to females. I think the reason the reviewers missed it is because the assignment of good and bad characters to the animals is too stereotypical -- good pigs and ducks, bad ferrets and weasels. Some exceptions help: the elephant can't remember; the goose isn't silly, but philosophical."
4,"Good Scanner, Good Price, but...","I bought this scanner a week ago and have been pretty happy with it. I teach computer science at a small college, and my main use is to scan figures from texts and articles for lecture presentation -- the 4400 does this as well as any machine I've used.The drawback as I see it is extraneous software installed on my computer. In particular, when I installed the scanning software, some other piece of software, BMCentral (great name, guys), was also installed. BMCentral immediately tried to set itself up as an Internet server, letting who knows who do who knows what on my system. Fortunately my firewall blocked it and issued an alert right away, and BMCentral was easy to uninstall."
1,Poor support,Unit setup went well but when I tried to scan my computer couldn't find the scanner. After several calls (no toll free no.)and several hours of trial and error Visioneer admitted that they a problem running on an Athlon processor powered PC. I never got the scanner to work and sent it back.If Visioneer had been upfront in their specs I could have avoided this waste of time.
4,Mighty fine. Good quality for the price.,"The setup for this scanner was exetremely simple. (Make sure and follow instructions, it might mess up on you if you don't.) It only took me about 15 minutes for completely set it up, and within 5 minutes afterwards I had already scanned in 3 pictures! :-)This is a great little scanner for home use. Don't expect professional quality, but do expect pretty gosh darn good quality. (Yes, I'm from Kentucky. :-D)The software that comes with it isn't the tops, but it's not so bad. I myself use Corel Photo House 5, which came with my computer, and not the scanner. So if you can lay your hands on a low-priced copy of that software, that'd be great.If you're wanting to use the scanner for professional publications, etc., I wouldn't recommend it, but if you just want to use it to scan in family photos to share with family, or on your website, then great! :-DI do hope this review helped. :-D"
1,No drivers for my OS and is not going to be...,"I'll have to dispose it soon. It is completely unsuitable for my Linux desktop and I've given up to find its drivers. The manufacturer neither provides a driver nor disclose tech spec to let others to write it. In short words: don't buy it for whatever OS except Windoze. (Well, 1 star can be earned for at least working under MS-OSes)."
2,Mediocre with Windows XP Worthless for Windows 7,"Constant problems when using with Windows XP.Slow operation, hard to load software, poor resolution, the list goes on.When it came to upgrading to Windows 7, forget it!No drivers are available after hours of searching on the web.And by the way Visioneer on their website states,""This product is classified as END OF LIFE.""I'll just have to keep an old PC with previous operating system around just to occasionally use this scanner which has had very little use and is in great shape but the company can't be bothered with providing a driver for."
1,Broken within 2 months,The scanning bulb went out within 2 months with very little use before it went out. Trying to obtain service from Visioneer to get authorization to return this product is short of impossible. I waited on long distance call for almost an hour and still never got through. POOR customer satisfaction indeed.
3,Short Cables!,"I agree with most of the positive reviews that this scanner is fairly easy to use and adequate for amateur use. But good grief, the USB cable is about 3 feet long and the power cord maybe 4 feet, forcing me to keep the scanner on prime desktop real estate."
4,A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE,"THIS IS A SHORT BUT VERY ENTERTAINING READ FROM GILES VILLEMURE, FORMER GOALIE FOR THE NEW YORK RANGERS IN THE 1970'S. HE GIVES HIS OPINION OF VARIOUS TEAMATES, COACHES AND SEASONS. THE BOOK MOSTLY COVERS 1971-72 SEASON IN WHICH THE RANGERS REACHED THE STANLEY CUP FINALS. I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A GOOD READ AND ENJOYED THE VARIOUS INTERVIEWS WITH ROD GILBERT, ED GIACOMIN, BRAD PARK AND OTHERS. MR VILLEMURE DOES A GREAT JOB WITH THIS BOOK AND I RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL HOCKEY FANS."
2,Disappointed Hockey Fan,"I received this book as a gift, and as a long-time NY Ranger fan, it was disappointing. Perhaps too much time has passed for such a retrospective. It lacks the necessary feel of the time - no sense of the excitement that existed with the Ranger teams of the early 70s. There are no new insights into either the players or the team as a whole. Seems that everyone was a ""Great Guy"" and a Great Teammate. I recall those years as the most exciting in Ranger history, but this book manages to make it all seem very uninteresting."
4,Great Fun!,"Purchased Monte Carlo, as I remembered seeing the original on TV several years back. Still a fun mini series with a lot of glamour. Entertaining stuff!"
2,This film induces sleep.,"There's probably a good reason MONTE CARLO didn't have the success of SINS--it's not as good. Joan Collins looks lovely and her wardrobe is beautiful, but i found this to be a very boring film. Olive Films has also released SINS on dvd. I highly recommend SINS--it's a delicious escape--much better plot, better acting, better fashion, better location, more Stars. I grew up in the 80s, and i loved watching mini-series, but i never saw MONTE CARLO till now. It almost put me to sleep--the boring pace, bad acting. I felt this could have been condensed into one 2-hour film. SINS, on the other hand, is one of my favorite 80s miniseries, and i'm so happy it's finally been released on dvd here in the States. This is just my opinion, but if you're wondering which is better, i recommend SINS--it's juicy fun!"
4,To The Audience A Dud,"No, just kidding. I just wanted to have fun with the title like everyone else. And that title is so much fun to begin with. I've watched this two times. The first time I saw this I did not like it. Upon the second viewing this is a really slow burn but I did enjoy it the second time around. Christopher Lee just makes for a fun bad guy. He was great in The Man With The Golden Gun and the Hammer Dracula films. There are some Satanic goings-on. The film builds and builds slowly to the final climax which my leave one unsatisfied but it all makes for good fun. Hey both lead actors (Lee and Richard Widmark) lived to be over 90. Widmark died at 93 and Lee is still going strong at 90. But anyway, the movie needs to be seen multiple times to take it all in. If you're patient, this movie just may reward you."
4,TO THE DEVILS A DAUGHTER,"Again Christopher Lee cast as the evil priest in this hammer production,the show was good but believe the plot could have been better.anyway with natassia kinski as the lovely devils concubine is worth watching without any comments,strongly believe if this movie was produce now it would be definetly better with the new movie technology .will give 4 stars"
3,An anti-climactic swansong for Hammer horror,"To the Devil a Daughter was Hammer's last horror film, but it makes for a less than grand slice of guignol and pales in comparison to their earlier Dennis Wheatley adaptation, The Devil Rides Out. Richard Widmark is the imported American star battling Christopher Lee's Satanist while trying to protect Nastassja Kinski from becoming host to a demon, but despite a few good scenes the film never really makes much of its premise and the ending is one of the biggest anticlimaxes in the history of horror.The best part of it is the excellent documentary on the Anchor Bay DVD, which is surprisingly frank about the film's shortcomings - including that non-ending - and Richard Widmark's tantrums on the set. Anchor Bay's transfer is also surprisingly good: unlike the cold and slightly shoddy looking TV prints, this really does David Watkins' cinematography a great service."
3,Disappointing,"""To the Devil a Daughter"" is a late Hammer movie, coproduced with a German production company. The plot involves a satanic priest (Christopher Lee) who is after young Catherine (Nastassja Kinski), who is under the protection of John Verney (Richard Widmark), author of occult books. The story is promising and the movie is, for the most part, well directed but the script just isnt't very good, and the ending is just ridiculous. Much of the cast deliver routine performances. The best performances are from supporting actors Honor Blackman, Denholm Elliott and Anthony Valentine. 2,5-3 stars."
4,Another Minor Classic from Hammer's Final Days,"""To the Devil..."" is marred by a clumsy, rushed ending, but prior to the final four minutes, it's fairly stunning stuff. Hammer films were going out of fashion in the 1970's, but not necessarily for lack of quality. Some of the most experimental, daring stabs at literary, gothic horror came from this era of the studio. This film boasts a nice cast and is one of few films to explore black magic in a detailed and accurate manner. Based on the Dennis Wheatley novel.Recommended for companion viewing to:The Devil Rides OutThe Wicker Man (original only)Demons of the MindCaptain Kronos Vampire Hunter"
1,To The Devil A Daughter,"Widmark And Lee are great actors and have great performances,but the story of an Ex-Communicated Priest(A Heretic) and Nuns,and a mysterious Order in Bavaria do not make sense,they could have just done it to be a Cult,but sadly had to go it the other way.The movie is graphic but that is the least here,cheesy special effects and low grade scenes(even for a Hammer Film) make this a snoozer."
3,"Us Hammerheads feel ""Compelled"" to watch this'n","O.K. , so i'm a completist ! I just had to watch this film . It being Hammer's last horror film (and the next to the last 50's through the 70's run of pictures i understand) ? This is a pretty darn depraved film . The gentleman who wrote that of the picture in his ULTIMATE HAMMER COLLECTION review is correct . Still , with that great cast and Lee doing such a brilliant bad fellow ? Lots of interesting stuff here . I streamed it via ROKU . Would i buy it ? Nah . But you may feel different . Worth a stream or rental at least ."
4,I give this cd two snaps a twist and a kiss...,"I got this cd about a week after it came out, and have listened to it about 15 times all the way through already. No two songs sound the same, but each one has it's own catchy style. Lyrically the cd is very diverse also. With songs titles like She's a Biter, you have to expect some humor, but they did a good job of balancing it out with more serious songs. GO GET IT! NOW!"
5,100% Rockin,"This CD was non stop 100% fresh, fly, and dope. The vocals were great, with the lyrics being extremely witty. The music itself rocked me, and made me wanna skank my brains out. Two thumbs up to these guys, and I hope this is just the beginning of a very successful music career."
1,marginal at best,"This is what I expected from these guys, luckily they are broken up. There is much better music in the world, ie anyband but these guys. Dan Melius was the only member of the band who had talent."
1,not witty but unintentionally hillarious (BAD!!!!),"Wow i didnt realize that anything this side of nails digging into a chalkboard could be this terrible. One song after another is annoyingly cartoonish and bland, very ""reel big fish""-esque. What a joke that the lead singer claims influence from the police or the (scoff) backstreet boys, or that the sound includes ""latin."" The music on this CD is about as diverse as any given set of suburban front lawns, which is also a pretty exact conceptual metaphor for the aural banality written across this waste of CD lasers. Did these kids really put up money to make this disc? Maybe instead they should have just bought a gag for the hysterically overstraining lead singer. I bet he thinks his astoundingly UNwitty, UNfunny, incredibly mundane lyrics are funny, but the real joke is on anyone who actually paid money for this pathetic attempt at ""music"" - luckily i wasnt that dumb!!!"
3,Just okay,"I didn't find this book to be very inspiring or helpful. If I wanted to paint a particular picture EXACTLY as the artist did then this book takes you step by step telling you exactly what colors to mix, where exactly to put a certain shade or highlight etc. Almost a paint by number instruction. Not helpful when you want to work on a different project. It doesn't translate into a broader sense of how to create certain effects and apply them to your own artwork."
3,"Titanic was out of luck, so was I","I ordered and received a copy of this DVD boxed set. When it arrived I found that there were 2 DVDs, played the first it was good. My wife and started to watch the second DVD and found that the second disc was identical to the first. Sent them back and asked for replacement set. They arrived. You guessed it, same story again. Amazon let me keep this set and credited my Visa A/C. Seems like poor quality control at A&E. I just want a complete set. Anyone else had this problem?"
5,Titanic documentary,So glad to replace my videos. becoming hard to find. I would recommend this very highly to anyone. Glad to get it.
2,Soporific Titanic,"With Titanic Centenary mania sweeping the world and having seen "" A Night to Remember "" years ago, ( a classic film ) as well as the more recent "" Titanic "" ( great sets but silly plot ), I decided to "" take the plunge "" and order this 2 DVD set. What a disappointment. Having just completed reading an excellent book on the three sister ships, I found this doco quite dull, to the point of sending me off to sleep. David McCallum and other narrators speaking the parts of survivors were so monotone in their presentation as to make a fascinating historical tragedy quite bland.The overlapping of historical photographs with film I found annoying, and even though the interviews with people who remembered seeing the ships being built in Belfast was interesting, a lot more detail could have been given and more historical photographs shown as to their stages of construction.This documentary was historically correct, but presentation and narration left a lot to be desired."
2,Not very good,"I've read most of Simenon's non-Maigret novels, and this is unfortunately one of the least impressive. Clumsily plotted and over-heated without any genuinely effective characterizations; do *not* begin your reading of Simenon with this book!"
1,Rewind: Dance Classics,"This is GREAT!, if you like disco, and all your songs to sound the same. I threw it away!"
5,Snyder's of Hanover Honey BBQ Pretzel Pieces,I think this is the best of the Snyder's of Hanover product line. It has a wonderfully smoky sweet BBQ flavor.Unfortunately I cannot find it in the stores; fortunately it is available here online.
1,My cat's won't eat these things.,"I have two Siamese cats and they will not eat these. These ""candies"" are very hard and don't smell like a typical cat treat. My cat's prefer soft treats. I wouldn't waste my money on these."
1,"they wouldn't let me choose ""0 stars,"" sooooo ....","Steven Seagal, garbed in denim jackets throughout the film,makes himself a thorn in the side of herb-puffing gangsters.It's a film definitely worth watching, for those of you whoenjoy plotless action with a lot of girlish running andawful acting from my man, Seagal.Now, there are several layers of meaning here. For instance,one could take the hermeneutical tack and analyze the many scenesin this movie in which gratuitous mayhem and very-bad-acting predominate,..."
2,Marked for video release,"OK, this is a Steve ""bonecruncher"" Seagal flick, not the royal shakespeare company, still, a little imagination or even script-writing might not have gone amiss.I mean, this guy can fight,and those scenes are well done indeed, no doubt about it, but I would say this is one of his lesser films on the whole. If you want to see Seagal, watch Under Siege or The Glimmer Man instead."
4,Inspiration,"As a martial artist and narcotics officer (at the time this movie came out) I was inspired by this movie. We had a large, violent gang in my city, selling drugs and creating mayhem. Needless to say, after watching this movie my arrest went up and I tried some Seagal moves, it was fun. Now I'm older and wiser and my career is winding down but I'll never forget those days."
4,CIA Steven Seagal style,Another great movie for Steven Seagal. I like that he exposes all in this fantasic film
4,marked for death blu ray,"I was a little worried as the descrition stated that it was only playable on U.S.machines as I live in the U.K.I read an independant asynopsis of the disc which stated that the disc would play on 'A' and 'B' macines (U.S. and U.K.)and this proved to be the case,so I am happy.The film itself is one of Steven Seagal's classic and has lost none of it's excitement these many years later."
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. PLEASE!,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS REPACKAGED VERSION. I SAY AGAIN PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. ANYONE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET THIS FOR FIRST TIME EVER & IF YOU ARE HARDCORE FAN OF THIS MOVE, YOU MIGHT WANT TO BUY THIS BUT GIVE IT A RENT FIRST SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS EDITION HAS EXACT SAME DISC AS PREVIOUS EDITION (NON-ANAMORPHIC). THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS EDITION & OLDER EDTION IS THE NEWLY PRINTED COVER. IF YOU HAVE OLDER EDITION, PLEASE KEEP IT. DON,T BUY THIS EDITION TIMES 10000. END OF STORY."
3,It lacked a lot by the not showing full screen,The movie is sorta old so guess that is why it was not a full screen. Sometimes you could not see full bodies just waist up. So not one I was 2 pleased with from all my other movies. Even though it was the last movie I needed to complete my Steven Seagal movies. So I still will shop at Amazon hoping the next ones do not be so small. Also I know I have a couple old movies on there I am getting ready to purchase by Chuck Norris to finish his collection I have. You could start putting some info on your movies to make sure you are getting the ones you are looking for. What you have does not say much lucky I know my movies. By being a paraplegic and not getting out much I do rely on the DVD's and your help to find my needs to keep me busy.
3,Steven Seagal Is Hard,"This film is simply awesome Steven is in perfect shape and annihilates everything in his way. If your already a fan of his work then this film will rock your world, and if you haven't watched the great one before then where have you been.SEAGAL is God, all hail."
2,Bad Widescreen Format,"I see lots of reviews from fans that love the movie, and the actor. However I don't see a lot of reviewers, especially videophiles, making any comments about the DVD itself. Mainly that this particular version *the red cover with his silhouette* is encoded in what I call 'bad widescreen'. Usually the DVD player puts the black boarders on the top and bottom. However on this edition they are encoded on the disc. That means they wasted valuable space on the DVD that could have contained more video information. It may look good on your little video monitor, but this DVD does not stand up to large format TV or digital projectors. Even through my Blu-Ray player, there is no upscaling because the information on the DVD is so limited.So what I am saying is avoid THIS particular version unless you are going to watch it on a CRT screen."
3,Marked For Death?,"A lot of people concider this movie and Out For Justice two of Steven Seagal's best. They're probably right but that's still not saying much.I found this movie, and Out For Justice very disturbing. Not because of the gratuitous violence, but because these movies could have been so much more. They have the plot, they have great villains, but unfortunately they also have Steven Seagal. I guess the script gets ""dumbed down"" to keep up with Seagal's acting skills. He's got the look, he's got the moves but he can't act. There's no feeling, no drama, no story to be told, just brutal violence. Some people like that in a movie, but it just doesn't leave you with anything.If these movies had been done the right way, great action movies like Die Hard would be harder to remember."
3,Marked for Death is nothing new.,"(...)This is a formula action picture graced with some brutal fight scenes. In other words, it's your average Steven Seagal movie."
3,Not too shabby,Very good. The combinations moves are excellent as always. He doesn't let you down at all in this film. The way he man-handles people though does get funny at times.
3,Predictable but Interesting,"Seagall plays a DEA agent who's lost his ideals and has forgotten what he is fighting for. He returns to his sister's family for some R&R; and to regain his center, only to be dragged into conflict with a vicious Jamaican drug gang who uses voo-doo to scare everyone.THe action is good, the dialogue lousy. The sub-plot is about redemption and violence. It tries to explain why good men have to use violence to keep the world safe. While it gets lost in the bone-cracking, head-chopping and gun fire, it is there.Sometimes, to protect the people and ideals your love, you must resort to violence. There are bad people in the world who don't care for anyone or anything and will destroy everything to get their way. To stop them, using their methods are necessary.Is Seagall redemped after it all over? That question isn't answered but let's hope so."
5,Sarah's best,"Mmm mmm mmm if you love her ballads, this is the CD for you! One of my favorite suicide mixes...(for those who like to wallow in depressing days) ;) ""Full of Grace"", ""Gloomy Sunday"", and of course, ""I Will Remember You"" are among the best. The harmony on ""Song for a Winter's Night"" is earcandy. Lots of Sarah's yodeling and half yelps included. Very soothing as always. This is THE essential Sarah McLachlan recording."
5,absolutely breathtaking,this is a wonderful C.D. My favorite tracks on it are Full of Grace and Gloomy Sunday. Gloomy Sunday is a song originally done by Billie Holiday and I think Sarah sings it just as good. I recommend this C.D as well as all of the other C.D's by Sarah. Each one has its own style and beauty.
5,misinformed,"Firstly, I would like to make something clear-Sarah McLachlan didn't write the lyrics to ""Dear God"", XTC did. Personally, I find this song to be both complex and beautiful, and Sarah sings it very well. I am glad to see that many other reviewers appreciate and enjoy ""Dear God"".This album is excellent, especially for ""hardcore"" fans of Sarah McLachlan. The dance remixes are funky and interesting, and the covers are great listening material. Highly recommended!"
3,Rare!,"This is sort of like a collection of greatest hits for Sarah, which explains why only 5 of the 13 (yes, 13) songs are not remixed or done live. ""Dear God"" is an atheist anthem, and if you're not compelled to turn off the CD right then and there, ""I Will Remember You"", is a good one. The most underrated is probably ""As the End Draws Near"". It's ""1999"" like, and very weird. Collection is good, but is a little sideshowish. If you really can see music for its creativeness and not entertainment, this is the CD for you."
3,have heard better...,up 'till now - i loved all things sarah...this album...not so much...just a hodge-podge of not-so-great stuff is the best way i can describe it...save your bucks...
3,Re-surfacing...,"I bought ""Rarities, B Sides and Other Stuff"" on a whim. Usually, I suffer for such purchases so my expectations weren't high. However, to my knowledge, this is the only CD release of ""I Will Remember You."" It's a great tune, and the only good thing that came out of that insipid Brothers McMullen movie. I've lately found that Sarah McLachlan's music has gotten a little watered down as she's grown successful, but this CD seems to provide a fresh edge to her music. Maybe it's just a different spin on what's already been done, but I enjoyed it."
5,Exquisite!,"Sarah is at her best here. Her beautiful and one-of-a-kind voice could never be matched by anyone else. Even without all the techno and brilliant synths, she would stand above most any other vocalist out there today! I have had this album for years, and have never grown tired of it. What a God-send Sarah is!"
4,Well worth it.,"I'm really glad I bought this CD, even though it was import-priced where I got it. It has several songs off of ""Solace"", which for some reason is the one Sarah CD I just do not really like. I haven't bought it, and now I don't really need to. This disc has enough of them for me to be satisfied that I have a representative sample. This is also a good pick for ""I Will Remember You,"" -always a great song. It also has several songs I hadn't heard before, but all of which I like. ""Dear God"" and ""As the End Draws Near"" are great, and her cover of ""Gloomy Sunday"" is worth the import-price all by itself. As great as Billie Holiday did it, Sarah more than does it justice. It has several remixes, most of which are interesting but no reason to buy the CD. The ""other stuff"" is more than reason enough, though."
3,Irony,"Quick note on ""Dear God"". Didn't anyone notice she is singing a song to someone she claims not to believe in thus confirming that she actually does believe in him or why would she be talking to him? Ya get it?"
2,I Agree with Lake131,"I guess no one has the guts to agree with the girl who wrote the review against Sarah's ""Dear God."" I am sure that the girl knows by now that Sarah did not write the song; BUT she still recorded it. While I like the cd; I have to agree with Lake131 that the song does not belong on this cd. It is going against all religious beliefs. XTC may have written it, why, only they know. I tend to agree that it is merely a cop out, blame God for OUR problems, no way. We create our own problems, and God is there to protect us. Satan causes disease, and hunger, and strife, it is his way of turning us against God. You better believe in heaven and hell, saints and sinners and the devil as well. Pearly gates and thorny crowns....He is NOT letting us humans down, WE are letting HIM down. Face reality people. Wake up and give the girl credit for stating her beliefs....something no one else had the courage to do! The cd is awesome, I own it, I listen to it...but I also skip track one!Melody"
4,liked the movie,I really like this movie. I watched it when I was younger and I still like it today. Thank you.
2,"supergitl , un bon nanar","j avais vu ce film au cinema a sa sortie et je voulais le recheter depuis longtemps, voila qui est fait , honnetement le film a vieillis, mais pas tant que ca , les effets speciaux restent visible mais le scenario est pathetique.comme a l epoque, j ai adorer la prestation de faye dunaway dans son role, celui d une sorciere malefique mais tellement ringarde que ca en devient drole et comme tous les vilains du cinema americain de l epoque son sidekick est ridicule , sinon que dire de ce film c est qu il reste agreable a regarder et ne manque pas de charme dans son genrej adore les series Blook this movie only for faye dunaway in witche charactere, a pathetique vilain who take a cosmic power and rule only on a little city , its a B movie no headheack for the scenario just take a time for funimage and sound are good"
4,I thought this movie was pretty good!,I saw this movie in the theaters along time ago in 1984 and I loved it. I thought Helen Slater was fine in this movie when she played Supergirl. It's a good movie.
5,Get this DVD!!,"If you are a fan of Supergirl, you must get this DVD to see the movie in its original form. Please the voice over commentary on the first disc is worth hearing. Demi Moore was suppose to be in the movie as was Christopher Reeve. It might cost a lot but it's worth it all the way."
4,"""Underrated!""","Helen Slater, Faye Dunaway and Peter O'Toole starin this 1984 sci-fi fantasy film based on the comics.Superman's cousin tries to stop an evil sorceressfrom using a powerful orb. I watched this on tvgrowing up and always enjoyed it. This 2-discset not only has good picture and sound, but2 versions of the film and some neat extras.I recommend this underrated film."
3,Fun Super Heroine Movie,The movie is a little corny but very cute. Helen Slater is a good actor to play the part of Supergirl. The storyline is entertaining and simple but cute. There is enough action in the movie to maintain the attention of DC Super hero fans. There is fairly good depiction and related story to the comic book story. I alreayd know the story from the comic book and found the story's ability to appeal fair and entertaining.
3,"No Superman, But...","In lieu of the recent addition of Kara/Supergirl to the cast of Smallville and the fact that it's a spin-off of the Christopher Reeve Superman series, Supergirl is a keeper. Cheesy? YES. In fact, as were many superheroine portrayals in the 1980's, this would be one of the dingiest portrayals of a female superhero to date. And it's more of an attempted comedy than it was a superhero/action film. However, her interaction with the Superman poster, her rooming with Lois Lane's sister, the cameo appearance by Jimmy Olsen, and our first glance at the Phantom Zone make for a good addition to one's Superman collection. In fact, as cheesy as the movie was, the things that urked me more than the comic approach and stiff dialogue were: (1)how did the Kryptonian module find it's way into the lake, (2)where did the Supergirl outfit come from, and (3)how she was a brunette as Linda Lee and a blonde as Supergirl? Oh well...it's only fiction...a cheesy yet fun keeper."
2,SUPERGIRL,"This one is about a group of surviving Kryptonians, living in the flying Argo City and one of them happens to be Superman's cousin! The thing that really dissappointed me about this one was the horrid story. The idea of Supergirl coming to earth in pursuit of a magic Kryptonian device only to get in a ridiculous love triangle between a gardener and nutty witch is pretty dumb for a superhero film. While Supergirl does have some okay moments, the conjured up monsters and the sfx for them were blurry and difficult to understand. Also, the inclusion of Jimmy Olsen, while interesting, doesn't seem to fit in anywhere.Lucy Lane was a good idea though. Overall I was dissappointed by this movie, but the only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of Helen Slater's one of a kind portrayal of Supergirl. Watch it, but don't expect to see a super-movie."
5,super treatment for supergirl -thanks anchor bay!,"I've always had warm feelings for this fim and Anchor Bay has done wonders with Supergirl on DVD. The film looks better than ever, there are tons of extras, and they have released both the international version and the director's cut.This is a sweet fantasy movie made even better by the quality treatment of Anchor Bay. Very nice job."
4,Hail Helen Slater as Supergirl!,"I really did enjoy this movie even though like many have said there are holes in it! Slater is beautiful and brilliant in this movie! She could truly bring a great sense of determination and innocent curiousity of her surroundings as Supergirl! I wished though the story could have been done better because she probably would have made more sequels, and be typecast forever as Supergirl! Well, what am I saying she already is! Even though the characters could have been created a lot more better(Dunaway as a true example), you can't help but enjoy them, and be entertained!"
2,A Guilty Pleasure,"I hadn't seen the movie Supergirl in years, remembering it to be truly dumb, silly fun. When I received an Amazon.com giftcard for my birthday I bought a few different movies, including Supergirl. It was just as I'd remembered it: Probably one of the worst movies ever made with some of the most talented actors in the world, i.e., Peter O'Toole, Faye Dunaway, Brenda Vaccaro and more. It's nice to have it in my movie collection for a good laugh when I need one!"
3,Wish it would've been better.,This movie is about as corny as any 80's movie could be but I still liked it after all these years. It's not Helen Slater's fault that the script was bad as she had no say in it and special effects at the time were blah and the plot overall was retarded but there is something in the film that still makes it worth while. Maybe it just reminds me of the good ol 80's or maybe it is the superlicious Helen Slater. I don't know but if you haven't seen this one and you are a fan of the other Superman movies give this one a try.
4,Super Camp at its best,"Simply put its some of the best camp in a movie. Which Faye Dunaway is again amazing. If you love Baby Jane, Mommie Dearest, and Valley of the Dolls you must see this movie!!"
2,It's okay!,"This movie was pretty good but it's not as good as the Superman films. This is kind of a rip off from Superman. Supergirl was a big hit back then in 1984 but later on it became one of the worst Superhero movies of all time. Helen Slater did play great as Supergirl but the rest of the cast in the movie are boring. At least I saw Jimmy, the photographer from Superman. If you look really close during the movie you'll see a picture of Superman that was from Superman: The Movie. Do not buy or rent this movie unless if you had a bad day or a boring weekend."
3,So So,"This movie is all right i suppose if you are a die hard superman/supergirl fan. One thing you have to keep in mind is that this move was made back in the early 1980's, so color, sound effects, and special effects are going to be dull at best. While the plot is intriguing, one will come to find super girl in this movei is portrayed as ignorant, and all together boring. Not to mentiont the acting in this is faulty, and takes away any enjoyment you may find in this movie. If you don't like old films with bad acting and visual effect, i would suggest finding another movie, this one isn't for you."
1,Dull Superhero Movie Want-a-be!,Whatever is all I have to say about this stupidly made movie. Flat story with cardboard characters. This movie stunk!
2,flying blonde bimbo,"if it wern't for her very good looks and a great rack, this would be the most stupid movies I was dumb enough to buy. Superman had to make his costume, she comes out of water with one. Superman finds out about his powers by accedent, she starts out using like she has been using them for years. Considering how good superman movies are, this one sucks. BUT GOOD T AND A"
2,o.k. could have been better!,"Yes I have seen this movie and I prefer Superman.It was lacking some real adventure. There wasn't a whole lot happening,it was also getting slow in parts.I think a (real) disaster could of happened to put alot of lives in danger,that would have turned the excitement up a notch or two!"
3,well almost but not quite,cheesyas it isi ejoyedthis film. It was well directed by jeannot schhwarc. Helen slater is perfect as kara/linde lee/supergirl. Brenda Vacarro andFaye dynaway are wonder ful. Flying ecffects work. The creeplay sucks and that make it hard to watch this movie. Plot sucks and i dont care about th sopporting charcters nit even the Pter oolle guy zaltar
1,Supergirl is Supercrappy,"This movie really does give the Superman movies a bad name. This movie contains a horrible plot and terribly unconvincing acting, but don't get me wrong, Helen Slater didn't look to bad in the role, especially in her tight supergirl costume and skirt. The visual effects aren't bad, and the musical score is suprisingly triumphant. I love the music, I really do, and might even buy the soundtrack, but the movie it was written for is really quite pathetic. GREAT SCORE, TERRIBLE MOVIE."
1,God Aweful,"God Aweful, the worst superhero movie ever filmed, point blank. This even makes Superman 4 look like great cinema and that's a damn shame. I watched the first 15 minutes of it and shut it off in disgust. Their interpretation of Kara's character is just pitiful to say the least. She came off as an irresponsible little brat in the begining, how she went to earth and the entire scene where she emerges from the lake automatically wearing the Supergirl suit? ? ? come on nowDO NOT BUY, DO NOT RENT, just forget this movie even exhist's"
1,"""Why Are You Doing This?"" ~ I Have The Same Question Supergirl","I don't know if I've ever seen a more incomprehensible, absurb adaptation of a comic book superhero on film than the '84 travesity 'Supergirl'. I can almost hear the pre-production board meeting conversation, ""lets cash in on the popularity of the Superman films with a Supergirl spin-off. We'll find a female unknown to fit the supersuit and hire a couple of big names (Peter O'Toole and Faye Dunaway) to lend credibility to the project and we're done. Don't worry about the script, we'll have her fly around alot with beautiful scenic backgrounds and nobody will care.""Well you were right, nobody did care. About this movie that is. Just plain bad. The only film fans who would want to add this DVD to their collection are the hard core comic book completist (like me)."
1,some people will back anything,"I watched this tonight for the first time. I wanted to see it to say yes I've seen them all. I would have quit watching it as soon as Supergirl emerges from her ship wearing the ""super"" outfit but I wanted to stick it out. My kids, 5, 10 and 12 were yelling about how stupid it was but I wanted to perservere. It didn't get better. This was one of the worst, stupidest movies I have ever seen. Every thing about the Superman movies, that made you care, was lacking here. Its like they thought if they just slap the outfit on this girl it would hypnotize the masses and deliver a decent movie. Apparently this only worked for the weak minded. This movie totally sucked. It was stupid and not in a good way. I'm glad it was just borrowed from my neighbors. As soon as it was over I made the kids return it. I didn't want that piece of crap stinking up my house any longer than necessary. You have been warned."
3,Not that bad...,"This movie is not as bad as everyone would have you to believe...it's certainly no worse than Superman III. I haven't seen all the versions of this movie, though I hear that like Blade Runner whichever version you see changes your perceptions of the movie. I do completely think that Helen Slater nails this role and there are a few nods to the comic though not as many as you would hope. I wouldn't advise watching this if you want high art but if you have a few hours to kill and want something light-hearted than this is for you."
3,Supergirl DVD review,"The movie seems a little off beat. It acknowledges thatSuperman is one of Earth's greatest heroes and Kara's cousin,but then the movie goes out of its way to avoid any directcontact or involvement in his life except for a cameo appearanceby Jimmy Olsen. Special effects and music are not epic eitheron this movie. It other words, the movie looks kind of lowbudget to me."
4,Supergirl,this was a very good show i was not disappointed with it if you like peter o tool you will love this showthe item was sealed and package good i would deal with them again thank you for haveing the item i was looking for
3,"Could have been a huge hit, blame the director.","Despite its box office flop with mixed and negative reviews, Supergirl delivers well to the screen. Supergirl (performed well by Slater) heads to earth to search and retrieve the Omegahedron. While in search, she makes new friends, falls in love, meets enemies, and sees the difficult life of human beings. With the support of so-so characters played by A-list actors, Selena (Dunaway), Zaltar (O'Toole), and Alura (Farrow), the film could have been a huge success and a beginning of a great franchise if it weren't for the bad directing (Szwarc) and the weak plot (Odell)."
3,"Interesting revival, curious audio failure","There are plenty of reviews of this film already on file - and I have little to add other than to say that inspite of less than Shakespearian acting or ""writing"" - it's nice to see the entire movie. All too often commercial considerations force the trimming of material whose absence detracts from the film and, all too often, destroys its inner structure and logic. Such was definately the case here.My one complaint? Considering the trouble that was gone to to put together the ""uncut"" version of the film, I was astonished to note that the soundtrack, dialogue and all, was compressed into a not-very-effective MONOPHONIC mix! This was, technically, a major disappointment for what is otherwise a technically reasonable job.If it's a ""kinder, gentler"" Super... epic you wouldn't mind showing to your kids (witchcraft and the like notwithstanding), this is as close as you'll get. You have all the effects without the extended or detailed violence and gore."
3,Supergirl,"Cute WomanLiked the Movie or Film. Sexy Babe. All Right Looking.She saves the World, ""I Think""Glad I got it."
3,Supergirl deserves a 2nd look.,"As I was editing my some of my reviews and after slamming Supergirl with no stars, I decided to revisit the movie (the 138 minute version) and give it another look-see. Strangely I found it somewhat engaging, particularly when Kara had solo parts as both Linda Lee and Supergirl. My favorite contemporary actress, Faye Dunnaway appears quite captivating except when she does her 'Mommy Dearest' impression and Brenda Vaccaro's character really does provide excellent comic relief.However, the little sub-plot of Selena and her evil plans are simply absurd and add almost nothing to this movie. And I will say it one more time. The producers are guilty of the most blatant abuse of excessive movie product placement in modern history and I'm speaking of A&W; Root Beer. I've never seen an A&W; vending machine or know of anyone who owns an A&W; t-shirt.Regardless, it is NOT the worst movie ever made. It IS watchable but only with your remote and fast-forward button in hand."
4,So cheesy it's awesome,"I saw this in the store the other day and I put American Beauty back to purchase this.I love this movie, it's one of those movies that the all out Supergirl walks behind the tree as a blonde and comes out as having brown hair. cheesy factor makes it that much more enjoyable. I love the part where Faye Dunaways performance was just spectacular as was Peter Cooks.I do have to give it 4 stars because the audio transfer to DVD was below par, the music was too loud and the dialogue was to low. And there were some parts that just carried on for too long, like the runaway backhoe and the phantom zone scenes."
3,Supergirl the Movie,Please see my review for this movie under the widescreen format for more detailed info. Don't buy this movie if you're looking for a great sci-fi classic. Buy it for exactly what it is; an addition to the Salkind Superman franchise. It is shot with the same feel and look of the Superman movies. That alone makes it worth owning. The story is bad and so are most of the FX. I still recommend it to any Superman fan. It won't make you turn it off!
2,ah-- features what features?,"ahh i don't mean to complain , but i bought this disc with the hope it would be good but i was fooled. picture is great sound needs work. but i'll probably get the updated deluxe one . nice try though . the problem with it is it says there's extra features but all it plays is the film no features is included, miss advertising if you ask me."
4,Watch and learn!,"I first watched this movie about two years ago. At that time, the original, unmastered version was the only thing available and it made it unenjoyable to watch. The story, to me, is OK. It's interesting to watch because there is action throughout the whole movie. I did expect a ""superman"" feeling to it, which wasn't there but the special effects and strong star cast made it all worth it. I did wonder why Supergirl received no special attention from the city or people around her. I give special effects and acting 4 stars. I give the plot 3 stars. I am a fan of the Superman movies, so this one does fit in my collection and picks to watch now and then. I would recommend it but if you're not a big Superman fan, I would wait and purchase or rent this DVD when it comes out on single disc."
4,wonderful fantasy,"This is fantastic! Just give this collector's edition with both the Director's and International Cut a try. You'll love it! As for the matter of how Supergirl changes into her costume: The same type of transformation was featured in the earlier three Superman films. The suit often just appeared on Superman thanks to some unknown Kryptonian power. Here it actually makes more sense since Kryptonian science is shown to be able to make thoughts into reality, the material the suit is made out of is shown to be in the capsule with her, and she clearly wishes to be like her legendary cousin. I like that type of movie magic. This collector's set is a gem!"
1,"please, why????","why did they even make this corny movie. its so over the top early eighties, with stupid weird villains and just was not captivating at all."
3,not so pleased,The dvd did arrive when promised. The dvd it self was scratched and unable to read by player. I was not happy. I had to take.dvd to a local shop and they removed scratches so it would read in player. I shouldnt have to do this. All in all was not happy :(
3,boring,"My customer is very happy that I could find this movie for him, so he could add it to the collection he plans to take on his cruise around the world."
2,Supergirl or Super dud,"I can see way the critics didnt like this move, not a very good story line. If your a Superman/Supergirl fan this might be good to have for you collection"
3,Pretty Good,"I was surprised by how good the film was! Hello, Hello, Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello!"
4,Would Be 5 Stars With Better Storyline,"This movie didn't do as well as it could have at the box office simply because the story wasn't very well written. The special effects, score, acting and even the direction by Jeannot Szwarc were every bit as good as Superman, but the weak writing dragged down everything else.I gave it four stars simply because of the presence of the ever-beautiful Helen Slater, who glows in the role of Supergirl.Fans of Helen Slater should also check out the made-for-TV sci-fi drama '12:01' which is now available for the first time on DVD.The DVD itself gets high marks for the digital transfer, commentary by the director and film historian Scott Bosco and especially for having 5.1 Dolby Digital sound for the first time. It looks and sounds gorgeous on a home theater system."
2,Slater is Dynamite,"Cute and fun story of Supergirl treveling to earth to retrieve an artifact from her world that has fallen into the hands of an evil witch who Supergirl must now fight to take it back. Very likable actors, and Helen Slater is dynamite as Supergirl, she's cute, and fills the outfit well. A nice try."
2,supergirl,"i was looking for this movie. it wasn't good at that time, well it still not that good. the story line is so weak. even the acting, but it is still entertaining."
4,Super Girl,I like nostaglia. This was a unique step back in time for DC hero we don't see much of these days. Colorful and interesting.
3,Not bad at all!!,I give this 3 stars because it is not the best. I do how ever recommend it to collectors of Superhero films and any who collect Superman to complete thier collections.I find that I do enjoy it and it is fun. My daughters loved when they were young. I must have watched this movie 50 times at least over the years.It is obvious that the Salkinds lost thier way with this tale and it needed better writing. The actors as much as they get ridiculed did a fine job. I think the production was lost between serious and camp and did not know which way to turn.The commentary with the director is fun and infomative I recommend you watch it at least once with it. Great price and really not as bad as some say.
1,SuperGirl the movie,Never did receive the vhs tape in the mail... About 5 weeks later I was refunded.
2,Good flyingsequences!,"This movie really does su**,but the flying sequences are very well made.I remember that Sidney J Furie(The director of Superman IV)was asking the people who made the flying secuences and all the special effects in Supergirl for help(or advise),of how to make good flyingsequences that would please the audience.They did a great job!"
3,"This is a great movie, if you like to see the girl kickbutt!","I've watched ""Supergirl"" since I was a child. If someone was to watch it that didn't watch it as a child , they would probably think that it was stupid as I'm sure this Mr. Bishop does. But since I've grown up watching it, I love it. If you like superhero movies, why not give this one a try. It isn't a oscar-worthy film or as good as one of the Superman movies, but it's still good. And if you are like me, and like to see the girl kick-butt such as Batgirl, She-Ra etc.. than you will enjoy this movie. Oh, and Mr. Bishop, it is ""Wannabe"", not want-a-be. Haven't you heard the Spice Girls song?"
5,Great Underated Film Given A Great DVD Treatment,I have enjoyed this film for as long as I can remember and I still enjoy it to this day. The film fell alittle short but this DVD treatment makes up for it by giving us the International Version as well as a newer Directors Cut. The directors cut is the best giving us the best version of the film. It's sad it didnt do so well as I would have loved to see more movies about Supergirl.
2,Meet the last DAUGHTER of Krypton,"I have always had a soft spot for this campy spin off from the Superman series. An attempt at starting a seperate franchise (Reeve was balking at doing any more Superman movies), it tried to duplicate the formula, but lacked the budget and writing of the first two Superman films. Still it is great fun. Faye Dunaway is hysterical as Supergirl`s arch enemy. Helen Slater is bland as the girl of steel, but she is so darn cute that you don`t really mind. The plot is corny, the acting strictly comic book, and the most amazing special effect is the way that, no matter in what position Supergirl is flying or landing (including upside down!) her tiny red skirt remains demurely in place. Not high art, but fun and no worse than Superman 3 or IV, to be sure. Definitely worth a look, as long as you accept it for what it is."
3,"Supergirl, what I think","The first time I saw this movie I was about eight years old. At that time I thought it was an iffy movie. But as an adult I have found that my perspective has changed. I like the Idea of a female supper hero, I just wish the character was a little stronger. Now don't get me wrong I don't believe that it was the falt of Helen Slater, I thought she did an excellent job concedering it was her first movie. I just did not like the weekness written into her character. However I liked the innocence and youthful exuberance she brought to it.This film had a great cast, and a really cool storyline. So all in all I realy enjoyed the uniqueness of this film.A MUST SEE FILM FOR SUPER HERO FANS"
5,Excellent Movie that deserves all the credit it's due!,"I saw this movie on TV when i was a kid, and loved it. I still do. Let all those who say it's 'campy', 'boring', 'slow', etc see it, because chances are they've never seen it before and are just jumping on the bandwagon of total squares.Helen Slater's role as Supergirl is amoung her finest work, with 'The Legend of Billie Jean' coming a close second.Supergirl : The Movie is a great addition to anyone's collection, and really does deserve all the credit which is long overdue."
5,hes back and at his best,this is pur mick jagger at his best it might as well be a stones cd beware the song on vh1 god gave me everything with lenny kravith (...is bad...) but the rest is great rock on mick pick it up today its every bit as good as wandering spirit
2,generic rock,"I'm primarily a Stones fan, and hate Mick wasting his ever-decreasing days on disposable solo records when he could be working with the Stones. (Especially when he just said in ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE that the Stones will get together next year, ""But probably not for a whole studio album. I don't know what we'll do."" How about cutting out the solo albums, Mick, instead of cutting out the Stones albums?) GODDESS IN THE DOORWAY is really cookie-cutter rock. And the supposedly revelatory lyrics quickly change course once one or two personal lines are sung. Can't get too deep for a whole song, now, can we?! It's probably his worst solo album. That isn't to say there isn't some merit to it. But if you want some great Stones-ish rock, by a very young and good band, get the Strokes new (and only) album titled THIS IS IT. I mean it. type in ""the Strokes"" in the search box above, and consider what comes up. You won't be sorry!"
1,More of Mick's Schtick,This is the worst cd I have ever purchased. I am a longtime Rolling Stones fan that thinks it's time for Mick to roll over.Terrible!
3,"Mick Should've ""Stripped""","There's no doubt it's below par. It's very disappointing to me, because Mick Jagger of all people should not be releasing bad product. It's just too produced, too polished, too commercial, too boring and lifeless. He should've recorded all the songs live in the studio (""stripped""). To top it off there are at least three songs suggesting Mick is a Christian. I don't want Mick Jagger pushing any religion in his music."
5,like a river from a mountain ...,"Mick Jagger has become a parody in the mainstream, and even with the release of this album - it was made fun of by image standards. This album is very good. Very touching, fun, and just all around good music. The songs are catchy and there are some prize cameos on here too. The song ""joy"" featuring Bono is a highlight (it also includes Joe Perry on guitar) and the single ""God gave me Everything"" is Mick at his rocking best. This album reminds me of The Stones album Bridges to Babylon. It has the techinical side, the desperation, and the rock.I'm not ashamed to say that I am 17 years old & a Mick Jagger fan. He is a classic no matter what you say. It is nice to know that good music still exist somewhere with all this *pop* music floating around. And ""floating"" being the word here - since the mainstream music hasn't any real depth. This album does. So Cheers Mick."
5,Too cool.,"I think it is a peculiar truth that almost no one would claim that Jagger has a good voice, though many would argue that he is one of rock's greatest vocalists. This particular album seems to celebrate this odd paradox.Jagger may have tried a little too hard to cover a number of genres here...but so what. This is an edgy and modern sounding instant classic from one of the most important and influencial rockers of all time.One shudders to think how cool this disc might have been with Richards tempering Jagger's more eccentric moves.This is, however, an excellent disc."
1,one is too many stars,"a garbage album, save your money and buy uh, just about anything else by anyone else . . . maybe Frampton Comes Alive solo or the Joe Perry Project. . ."
1,Mick's over the hill,Time for Mick Jagger to retire to a rest home. This CD totally bombs. There are so many other worthy choices out there to be wasting money on this non-artistic dud.
2,avoid this! buy Deep Purple new album BANANAS!,"UNSATISFIED EGOS for the new mundane songs! the cd has full of clichees! it is a fact that Mick Jagger still needs money from all fans!! The songs are uninspired outside his Stones activities. I said WHAT A unsatisfied egos!! the songs are boring, Lenny Kravitz helped him in one song just because he is a big stones fans but he cannot do anything special for this Jagger album.PS:Deep Purple one the greatest Hardrock contemporary on earth is on the studio again by producing their new album BANANAS. The Purple new album has composed most of good songs and freshing sounds....Deep Purple is also an old band like Beatles and Stones, but they always produce new LPs and albums for their fans. As a result the PURPLE new album BANANAS got many good critics....see the reviews of BANANAS!!!"
2,Very Average,well Mick Jagger went looking for a Hit Album.get Rob Thomas&Lenny Kravitz.Up-Date a Sound.that's the Best thing I can say from hearing this Set that unlike ROlling Stones Albums this Album Sounds far More Up-Dated than the Stuff they have done in the last 25 Years IMHO.His Vocals aren't any Better so-so Songwriting at Best.the music is Hit&Miss.but I will say this is Better than His Usual Solo Albums but then again that ain't saying Much for Me.
1,"About as Bad as it can get, hopefully...","Here we have a 60-year plus veteran, from the most over-rated musical act in history, putting out melodically challenged screaming sounds (noise?) that would embarrass a teenage garage band. And other ""big names"" from the field are assisting in this painful-to-listen-to effort. And the lyrics are of the same dubious quality as the music (?):EG: ""Why don't you get a gun and just shoot it thru my heart?"" This CD is of interest mainly in hearing how low a rock icon can go when he should just fade away into retirement; and in the level of popular ""culture"" that has sunk to such a low, even for those who hoped in the post 9/11 era, things might improve. Perhaps they are improving, but you'll never know with this CD. Oh, also, obviously, the power of the almighty $ in determining what goes to market, too. Finally, how the media will refer to the perpetrators of this as ""Artists""!"
4,It's the singing that's so good!,"It's sort of annoying that Mick Jagger has made a great pop record. I would have wished for something low-down and dirty.And while there are a couple of hard rocking songs on Goddess to get you're blood pumping (the Townsend riffing on Gun is awesome), the best songs are really the pop songs. Dancing in the Starlight is gorgeous. The title track is driving, hypnotic. The ballad, Brand New Set of Rules, is wonderful. In fact, there's something good about all the songs, and this has mostly to do with Mick Jagger's singing: it's terrific! Wow!"
3,so so,Keith Richards said this album should be called DOG **** IN THE DOORWAY. That's a little harsh. A few songs are good. But Mick should be spending his ever-decreasing days making Stones albums instead.
1,which doorway Mick??,"Some reviewers might have rights to tell their humble opinions.....about his solo last album!It seems to be that Jagger feels still like an incredible singer. In fact he isn't!But the other rock male singers like Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickinson, Ozzy Osbourne or Ian Gillan are still able to do their own best things in their current ages. Jagger comes towards his individual aim too strong: he concentrates in the fame alots, but his new album has no concept at all! uninspired!"
1,Where's Keith?,"Mick really should let Keith do the song writting and arrangements. Mick can help a bit with the lyrics, although those also are getting lame and don't fit with Mick's persona. Sure Mick could tell Keith when he's being too repetitive - so yea, there's a role for Mick in the Stones. When Mick writes songs they just don't fit with his persona and lack soul."
1,Horrible!!!,"I Hate to say it but it's retirement time for Mick Jagger. Dont buy this it's really bad. Bad songs, bad voice one of the biggest waste of money i've ever bought. Real cringe inducing stuff. The rolling stones havent made a decent album for 20 years and unfortunatly Mick solo career isnt doing any better. Mick should just politely step aside and let today's artists like Wilco, The Strokes, Flaming lips do their work besides bombarding people all over again with pieces of trite like this!"
1,Time to Retire....,"This is another dreadful solo project from Mick Jagger. None of the songs are good and it smacks of desperation. When you run out of ideas, no amount of special guests or producers can cover up the fact that you are irrelevant. Buy this used...their will be plenty. (There already are.)"
1,Meh,"I thought when it said black, it would completely black out the windows like I needed. Not a fan and I didn't know there was a special spray needed either until I read the enclosed directions."
5,The best book I've ever read.,"I read Birth of the Firebringer last year, and I can't forget it. I love the book. I've been searching for it, but I cant find it. Jan, Tek, and Dag's story is incredible. A wonderful story of unicorns and magic."
4,Childhood Favorite Still Holds Fire,"This was my favorite book as a child obsessed with unicorns (when even my dance teacher presented me with unicorn-themed because of the hair at the front of my head that refused to lay down). I read it over and over back then, but 20 years later couldn't remember much about it. So I found a copy and re-read it, finding it as charming and captivating as I always had!It's a fabulous coming-of-age fantasy, complete with the requisite prophecies and dangerous journey for our hero, young Jan, prince of the unicorns.Even though this is the first book of a trilogy, it stands perfectly well alone - the sequel wasn't released til 7 years later, so, as a child I never even realized there was more to the story. But I have the second in the series, ""Dark Moon,"" at home, ready to be read! :)"
5,Aljan Lover,"I first read this book when I was 11 or 12. I have been absolutely insane about it ever since. I searched for the other books in the series for years, and judging by the price of the first editions, I'm not the only one who loved this book. I am thrilled that the book is being reprinted and the next two books in the series are on the way to my house now. (...) Pierce draws you into this world of unicorns and makes them tangible. Beware though, if your child gets hold of this book, they may become obsessed, but if they become obsessed about any book, this is the one."
2,Uneven writing,"The plot's not bad. Most of the writing is adequate, but with occasional lapses. It's full of repeated single word sentences ""Hist."", ""List."", and sometimes ""Hie."", clumsy archaisms, and plain bad writing. For instance, on pages 32 (of the ominbus volume) we find""His vitals turned.""and on the next page,""Tek feinted clumsily twice, three times with her horn, but missed each time."" (she confuses feint with lunge in several places)The Amazon blurb says ""reading level: ages 9-12"". 9-12 year olds probably won't mind, but I don't recommend it for adults."
2,very mundane vision of a unicorn culture,"I was eager to read it but greatly disappointed; these unicorns act far too human for my tastes. The mom, dad and prince live in a cave, the prince has his own little room where he goes to pout; I wanted to read something original and imaginative and more ""realistic."" Kids may be more entertained but adults with a broader base of literary tastes will be bored and even put off."
1,Didn't enjoy it.,"I often like the work of up-and-coming artists, and I love haunted-property films, but I did not like this movie. A few reasons stand out as to why. The acting was often stiff and almost always self-conscious. Tobias Motyka was the worst main actor in this regard (I say 'main actor' because the real estate agent takes the cake for worst actor, maybe ever). I found Matthew Faulisi to offer the most-credible performance in this film and quite enjoyed his take on the character, overall. The editing was abrupt and, at times, this further aggravated the choppiness of the script. The dialogue seemed unnatural for three twenty-somethings from Philly. Also, the actors sounded like they were from upstate New York, not Philly. To be fair, however, having lived in both places, that probably bothered me more than it would someone who hasn't lived either place."
3,"It's a movie, not a real investigation",I thought this was a documentary about the house. Instead it is a horror film. Not bad for a low budget film. The plot held my attention. The acting was college drama school level. Overall it was entertaining.
3,Good concept,"I love these types of movies and while this wasn't the worst, it wasn't that great. The house itself was quite lovely so to me that was the best part of the movie. The rest follows the same pattern on scepticism turning into belief. Some ""surprises"" were better than others. I would recommend it to those of you who can get it free on Prime Video if you are a fan of these types of movies but not for pay."
2,"Bad acting, but entertaining enough","Title says it all. Bad acting. Really bad. But, I did watch the entire movie, kept thinking it might improve or surprise me. Kinda predictable plot, boring and bad dialogue, and predictable ending, especially since there are more and more of these type of movies being made, but it was entertaining enough. Not scary, at least not for me. But then again, I watch a lot of horror movies, so it kinda takes a lot to raise my pulse or to surprise me.Kinda hard to recommend this movie but can appreciate the effort they put into it. There were some interesting scenes and ideas.If you do rent this, please do not have high expectations."
1,Not as wide as claimed,This product is supposed to be extra wide (6E) but it didn't even come close. The toe is almost pointed. Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes.
5,Laughing Mickey Mouse Watch,"Disney Men's A Laugh a Minute Laughing Mickey Mouse Dial Watch #MC0451-1928TNI purchased this Laughing Mickey watch for my husband, who loves Mickey Mouse! and he wanted to have more humor in his daily life, so I thought looking at this watch would help him do that. We put an expansion watchband on it to suit him."
1,Somebody lied to me!,"Um, so yeah this is not the brush for Afro hair. Somebody lied to me (Denimpixie from Youtube)! This brush will rip the heck out of your hair. I don't even feel as if I can give this product one star. It didn't even deserve that. To all of my 4b/4c ladies, DO NOT BUY THIS BRUSH! A waste of money, time, and hair growth! I'll be sticking to my Denman and Tangle Teezer!"
4,Doesn't hurt!,"I have long, very thick and curly hair. I had been using a wide tooth comb on my wet hair, but it hurt and each time I would end up with a clump of hair the size of my fist. I went searching for something else because it was either that or cut my hair off. I use this brush first on my wet hair before I tackle it with the comb. It gets most of the snarls out and it doesn't HURT. That is the main thing. It doesn't rip nearly as much hair out either. I would've given it 5 stars instead of four, but actually this brush would be better for me if it was a little bigger for the price. However, I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend it for people with thick hair that tangles easily."
5,Very satisfied,This brush works wonders! It goes through all the layer of my very thick hair and it actually feels great & refreshing.
5,SUPER Brush,Shipper delivers as promised and sooner than expected shipment arrival. Great product; really makes a difference on the texture and shine of hair.**Cleaning brush/tool for Mason Pearson brush included.
1,Not for natural hair!!!!,"Do not waste your money on this brush. I have natural 4a coarse hair that is arm pit length. I purchased this brush due to all the raves on the natural hair sites. If you detangle your hair wet or with oil this brush will not last. I usually detangle on wet hair with conditioner although the brush is not bad on detangling the bristles began to come out only after 1 year even after regular cleaning. The denman is a much better choice for natural hair, I am able to detangle in the shower and with oil without worry about the brush falling apart. Please do waste your money this Pearson brush."
1,Half a game,I purchased the game through Amazon and it is not there fault but the dvd is only half of the game. And it is innings 1-4 what am I gonna do with that.
5,A Very Wonderful Puzzle,"This wooden puzzle is very high quality and should last a life time. All three of my girls have loved this puzzle and it is still in wonderful condition!!! The animals are cute and very colorful. The plastic pegs are safe since they are buried deep in the puzzle piece, and they help the very young enjoy this puzzle. I highly recommend this puzzle!!!!"
1,not fun,"I purchases this toy for my daughter last christmas, she has never even played with it once. I found out that she much more prefers woodboard puzzles that she can put together."
3,The Night of Morningstar,"Have read all the Modesty Blaise books available and this is not one of the best, a bit slow at times but still enjoyable."
4,Good for beginners,"This book is easy to follow and good for bakers who are learning essential techniques. The recipes are pretty basic, and not that of William Sonoma quality or diversity. But, a good book to have on the shelf. I would purchase again."
5,all you knead is in this book!,another great book from the cooking goddess of the northeast! superbly scrumptious delights await anyone with thumbs and an oven. don't wait buy it today!
3,Lack of pictures a drawback,"This looks like a really good cookbook, but there are no pictures or photos of any kind, not even drawings. At the end of the book, the reader is directed to the author's website for pictures. There is a great color photo on the cover, but I was disappointed by the lack of even pen drawings to illustrate what look like helpful instructions to bakers."
4,Just fine.,"It's sturdy and does the job it's made to do. There's not a lot else to say about it. I would have liked it to be in a box instead of bubble wrap, as it was a gift."
3,FAILED TO ENTICE,"I read this book based on the potential of adventure of historic exploration. I was hoping to learn about geography, anthropology, biology, botany, and a number of other discoveries made by first time visitors. These subjects took back seat if they were mentioned at all. Instead, this book focuses on politics, bickering over rank, and other naval intricacies that I care little about and find tedious. It seemed as if the author compiled a body of facts and reported them dryly with little emotion or excitement. This was inexcusable as readers were told that each member of the expidition was required to keep a diary. Where did all the human interest go? I would not recommend this book to others. Maybe I should give it two stars."
3,New History?,I wonder what percentage of the Americans know little or nothing about this expedition? My knowledge of the subject was limited to passing references from other reading. This is a good book about a very interesting subject. Besides the pure adventure of the cruise and the science that it brought home this story provides interesting insight into the lives of the people involved.
2,"Biography - yes, History - No","Mr. Philbrick would be better off writing for Tuesday afternoon soap operas and leave writing history to others. This is supposed to be a history of the U.S. Exploring Expedition of 1838. Instead it is an indictment and psychological analysis of its leader, John Wilkes. Philbrick repeatedly makes assumptions about Wilkes' behavior that are just that -- assumptions. The people who were there probably didn't know what was going on, much less a writer 163 years later.As a biography the book may have some validity. As a history of the expedition it is deeply lacking. We keep hearing of the conflicts between the various memebers of the expedition, the outrageous behavior of Wilkes -- forever. Little of the actual, day-to-day work of the expedition is in the book.I bought the book based on the reviews shown on the cover. I will check things out a bit more closely another time."
2,Outstanding account of my region,"I know the South Pacific very well, including Antarctica, and found this book a brilliant and highly readable account."
4,"Music of conflict, pain and resolution","Of all the funeral music played by radio stations after the 9/11 disaster, this disc stands out as the most appropriate. Planes' interpretation admirably captures the pain and anger of that time, and lets the music provide its own consolation. I call this my ""conflict"" music, and play it whenever I have disharmony in my life."
2,Worked well..and then died,"I was pleased with its initial operation. It worked well and seemed sturdy, even if the water refill was a bit of a hassle. But then it died after 3 weeks. Amazon is sending a replacement and I do hope that the second one has a longer operational life. I dont know if I just received a 'bad' machine or if these are just poorly manufactured."
1,very disappointed,"Have given this product the benefit of the the doubt (even wrote a previous review) and have to say that I'm very disappointed at this point. The minerals calcify on the heating element AND the funnel piece, and the company's suggestion of using vinegar hardly helps when the humidifier is used on a daily basis.Plan to purchase a much easier product to maintain, even if I have to pay for extra filters (so long as I don't have the scrub the product to get it to be clean!)."
3,Underwhelming,"It's noisy when set on high, quiet when set on low.Filling the tank is awkward. Access from the top of the tank would be an improvement.You MUST keep it clean. Any calcium buildup on the heating plate will prevent the unit from working. I find that calcium still builds up quickly even though I replace the pad weekly.For those having trouble finding the mineral absorption pads, Home Depot stocks them - $5.99 for a 12 pack."
2,Stopped Working,"I purchased this item twice. The first time, it worked fine, but when winter ended, I put it in storage until next winter. When next winter came, it would not work -- the base unit was unresponsive. So I bought another one, thinking that this was a one-off problem. But, after that winter and subsequent summer storage, I went to use it again and (of course) the base unit will not work.The upshot? This unit will not work after being stored/unused. It is good for only one season's use."
1,3-Weeks...,"Dead in 3, seems to be the norm for this model. Mine just up and quit, even after following all the proper cleaning procedures.At least i am getting a replacement at no charge[not from KAZ..]After reading these reviews i suspect it also might last 3 wks!! I would NOT recommend this product."
1,don't buy this!,"The description it gives for the square footage that it's supposed to humidify is totally off. This kept running and running and running and then, after 2 days, it needed to be cleaned otherwise it wouldn't run and when I went to clean it, it was all crusty and I couldn't get whatever it was off of there! So I returned it promptly."
3,Good but requires lots of maintenence,"This thing does the job. I'm humidified. However, it has lots of parts that all require cleaning every couple of weeks. There is also a filter disk that needs to be changed semi-regularly. Maybe this is standard for humidifiers, but at any rate, it's a slight bummer.I should also note that, the description is a bit misleading. It doesn't contain 4 gallons of water, it outputs up to 4 gallons of water in a day. The tank is closer to 2 gallons."
2,Excellent--when it works!,"I used this humidifier for a little less than a month when it just stopped working. Amazon was excellent in replacing it immediately; however, the replacement worked for approximately two months. It also just stopped working. Amazon wouldn't replace it a second time and actually sent me an e-mail saying they are experiencing too many problems with this humidifier. Honeywell replaced it for me; I can't say how well the 3rd one works as I haven't used it yet since the winter months are over. I love this humidifier when it works; but unfortunately, that only happens for a very short period of time from my experience. There is some inherent problem with this product; although I asked Honeywell about their experience with returns and what kind of problem it has, I never did get an answer. I would love to recommend this product, but I can't as there is no longevity to it all."
4,Works well but a bit noisy,"I bought this product because I prefer warm mist humidifiers. I use the product in the baby's room which is approx 10'x10' and it works very well so I give it 3 to 4 stars. At the lowest setting, a full tank of water will probably last about 18 hours. There are 2 small drawbacks, however. First, its a bit noisier than I expected. About 10 seconds after you turn it on, the machine starts making gurgling noises, a low boil type of sound. At the lowest setting, its not too bad but at the highest setting, its kind of noisy. The baby seems to tune it out but I don't think I could sleep with this in MY room! Also, I'm never quite sure that the digital humidity indicator actually works. I've seen it jump from 32% to 44% in the space of a few seconds. I've set mine for 50% but I've never seen it actually get there. Still, if you can ignore these 2 issues, the unit does do a good job of humidifying a small room."
2,Quick Steam Warm Moisture Humidifier,"A great little unit for the two months of use; and a great name for the unit as soon as its turned on its generating steam. Simple and easy but not so quiet as stated in other reviews; and, the unit makes a gurgling sound regardless of High/Low settings or water level. The noise bothers the wife but not so much as for myself. After two months of steady use the unit suddenly stopped running. So were told ""There is too much moisture inside the unit, and completely dry out the unit before next use""; found this odd for a 4 gallon ""warm moisture humidifier"". In the process of appling the 5-year limited warranty by shipping the unit off to Kaz Inc in Memphis TN; however cautioned that 'normal wear and tear' will not be considered under this warranty."
4,Compact design. Too noisy for bedroom.,"I had it running for one night and am looking for a different one because it makes loud gurgling / boiling water sounds - kept waking me up all night EVERY time it had an ON cycle. I am a very sensitive sleeper though, so it may be ok for others, and keep in mind that the unit was right next to the bed on top of the night table (since it's very compact), on my wife's side of the bed. The sounds it makes are quite annoying and are not constant (it goes on and off). As far as cleaning, reliability etc - I can't say much, since I only used it once."
5,Honeywell Quick Steam Humidifier,I am delighted with my purchase of the Honeywell HWM450 Quick Steam Humidifier. It produces steam almost immediately. I like the automated time and humidity controls very much.
3,It is OK,"Last winter I could not stand the dry air in my bedroom any more -- I kept getting blood in my noise when I got up in the morning. I decided to purchase a humidifier for overnight use. According to consumer report, this type of warm moisture humidifier is the best kind because it is quieter than an evaporative type humidifier and doesn't have the negative side effects of an ultrasonic type humidifier. Therefore, I ordered this model of warm humidifier.After using it for several weeks, I think it is OK; but I am a little bit disappointed. It quickly brings the humidity level of my bedroom to a comfortable level. But it is not as quiet as what I had expected. I guess I was expecting too much; I was expecting it to be as quiet as the ultrasonic type of humidifier. But this is still OK in the sense that I can use it to quickly increase the humidity level in my bedroom before I go to bed, and then I can turn it off for the rest of the night. This routine works for me. Therefore, I am keeping it."
3,tempermental,First tank of water worked great. Second tank kept shutting off. I turned it down from high and that kept it from turning off. The display works sometimes. It doesn't really matter I suppose. It makes more noise now than it did a month ago when I bought it.I am using it daily and it's doing the job. Quality control isn't what it used to be.
1,Very Bad Buy,"I purchased 3 of them last year from home depot, worked fine one year, this year the problem started . The water leaks from the heating element into the electrical control system. All three of them have the same problem. I am trying to return them and not getting help from the customer service."
1,BROKE IN 3 MONTHS,"I should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before I purchased this humidifer. There was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it. Worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working. One of the controls literally ""froze"" in place and the machine was unusable. No way to fix it - had to throw it away. What a shame. Next time I will pay closer attention to what people write. My advice - by something other than a Honeywell. I have three packages of filters that I purchased separately - another waste of money."
2,Maybe it's me...,"I love the features and the performance is great compared to my older cool air models, but I have a really hard time getting the top screwed in to the container when I refill, almost like it is cross-threaded. I wind up wasting time grappling with it or worse, dripping water all over the floor when it doesn't seal properly."
1,330 and 450 Stopped Working,"I bought both the 330 and the 450. The 330 stopped working after 3 weeks. Called KAZ support. They said there was nothing they could do. Send the power unit in. I asked if they could send me a new unit, charge me for it, and then credit my account when I sent the malfunctioning/non-working unit in. Their response, ""No, that is not in our policy. We cannot allow that."" The 450 model stopped working after 6 weeks. Both purchases were a waste of money and KAZ support was less than helpful."
1,Leaks like a siv,The humidifer worked great for about 3 weeks. Then the tank began to leak at night and we would wake up in the morning to find 2 gallons of water on our hardwood floors. The seal and o-ring look intact and I cannot figure out why it leaks. I contacted the manufacturer and they have not replied.If it didn't leak it would be a nice unit. However I rated it a 1 because it doesn't work properly.
1,stopped working after 2 weeks,"suddently stopped working after 2 weeks. why are reliable humidifiers so hard to find, make?"
4,"Good, but has issues",Produces steam as expected. Easy to fill and clean. The spring in the fill cap rusted away within a few month. Using a spring that is not rust-proof in a device that covers the spring in water all the time is baffling. The humidity display is off by 5 (e.g. indicates 35% instead of 40%). Gurgling and occasional popping sound may bother some people.
4,Great humidifier,"We have used this humidifier for over 3 years now. It works very well, it is easy to use and maintenance is simple--occasionally spray some bleach into the tank and rinse; weekly-monthly use white vinegar to clean the base unit/parts. It produces steam almost immediately. It is easy to fill with water. It makes a white noise and some gurgling noises. We are buying a second one today."
4,Humidifier,"Price was right; easy to fill and operate; shows the current humidity in your house; easy to clean;Works well, we fill it twice a day while running on the low setting; when it runs out of water, the heater shuts down automatically. You know when it's time to clean when you take the water reservoir off and you see the remaining water in the basin is starting to turn yellow. It's easy to clean with a brush and some cleaning solution. Noise is not an issue. We put it on the landing upstairs outside the 3 bedrooms. I hear it at night but it doesn't bother me, its just the boiling sound and occasionally the glub, glub, glub of the water going from the reservoir into the basin."
4,started leaking after a year,"This has been my favorite humidifier ever, so much that I bought two. Cleaning required vinegar and a good soaking, but you can ""fool"" the unit into thinking you've cleaned by removing the digital control portion and replacing it. I found that I can rinse and reuse the mineral pads once and then they need replacing. After having a tough time finding them, I realized Home Depot stocks them. I've had the first unit for 2 years and the second for a year and they both started leaking within a few weeks of each other, resulting in soaked wet carpeting. I had to replace the one in my son's room with a cool mist as I was concerned about him getting burned. I'm not sure why they started leaking or if anyone has suggestions as to a fix. It just keeps putting out water into the tray and won't stop."
1,Junk,"We had this for a little more than two years, and now it doesn't work. And we always cleaned it per the instructions. Of course, past the warranty date. I would recommend buying another model. Very unhappy with it."
1,Disappointed,"After reading the mixed reviews on this product, I thought I would take the chance and purchase this unit. I am disappointed and will be returning the unit.Pros: Quick steam; works fast to raise humidity levelCons: Unit leaks; digital humidity reading is stuck at 20; tank is hard to fill because the handle doesn't make the bottom flatI tried the troubleshooting tips listed in the manual and cleaned the unit, but problems still existed."
2,Just Out Of Warranty,"About one month past the warranty period, the Quicksteam started to leak, badly.The filling floater mechanism is made of styrofoam. It wore out. When the unit called for more water for the reservoir, it starts filling, but will not stop filling. The reservoir overflows. I liked it for about a year, it worked well until then."
2,I'm glad I'm not the only one...,"Was great when it worked, but then it just quit, and I couldn't get it to work. Just in time for cold season."
1,Not worth the money,"This item worked for a few weeks just fine, but then would not turn on. I Do not recommend this product."
2,Overpriced 2 gallon humidifier,"Unit was received February 7, 20071. For the size of the unit I had hoped the tank would last for several nights. A full tank in the same 10 x 12 room does not last 8 hours.2. When looking at the photo of the unit the rounded white handle topping the blue water tank is what you must attempt to set the tank on while filling. Very annoying and unstable. You MUST hold the tank steady while filling.3. The opening lid opposite the handle must be tightened VERY tight or it will leak. This takes quite a bit of hand strength. The knurls on the side of the lid are not sufficient to tighten the lid. You must put your fingers in the provided holes.4. Either the display is incorrect/broken or the unit cannot create 55% humidity in a 10 ft x 12 foot room. The highest humidity the display read was 22%.5. This is NOT a 4 gallon tank. The maxiumum this tank holds is two gallons.I am disappointed. This is an over-priced 2 gallon humidifier."
2,Too small for large rooms. Broke after one week.,"I bought this humidifier for our master bedroom. It did run quietly which was great for sleeping, but it was unable to raise the humidity to our desired levels. It also ran out of water during the night. After one week, it stopped working. I think it would be more effective in a smaller or average size bedroom. The fact that it failed after only one week is reason to be concerned."
2,"Broke, but after almost 4 years","I really loved this humidifier, and Amazon isn't selling it anymore so I guess this review doesn't matter. Worked great until I used a descaler on it instead of vinegar. I think that is what busted it. And here I thought I was extending the life of it. I'm not sure if my low score is fair, because it did work for 4 years. You decide."
1,Very bad design. Avoid Honeywell,"I see several reviews indicate that this product died quickly, and I just want to emphasize that that's what happens with this thing. My girlfriend and I each have owned one of these, and both died after a few weeks."
1,Beware: Finicky operation,"The humidstat function of this humidifier cannot find a happy medium of outputting humidity; one setting causes incredible amounts of condensation, leaving puddles around the unit. And when it is set at a lower setting, the unit produces no mist at all. Is it a problem caused by the promise of 3x the normal speed of humidity production? I've used warm mist humidifiers for several years and a regulated amount of mist production was never an issue. Older units just failed when there was mineral build-up on the heating element and now current warm-mist units seem to come with filters to prevent mineral build-up. (Be sure to look for this.) These older units, however, never had the problem of humidity control as this Honeywell product, and I wonder if all the current Honeywell ""Quiet Steam"" machines give you the option of no mist or too copious amounts of mist.I have a real problem, too, with the fact that these sized units now cost $70-$100, rather than $50-$60."
3,customer service came through,"UPDATE_ Amazon customer service came through and back this product up with a replacement. No problems with the replacement and the item is working great. I give Amazon 5 stars for customer service.I've read through many of the reviews and wonder if they are talking about the same humidifier, appears that many of the people have unrealistic expectations.Humidifier is quiet, even on highThis is NOT a whole house unit. It is designed for a small apt or two roomsRefill of the tank is easy, but it is unstable when you refill.Controls are relatively easy to setUnit is expensive to run, it actually heats the water so it has to run a heating elementUnit does require frequent cleaning. This is not too bad a job unless you let the scale build up on the heating elementMy main complaint is that unit stopped working after 3 months. I haven't heard anything from customer service yet"
4,Once you get the hang of it...,"I live in an area with typically mineralized mountain water, so I prefer ""warm mist"" humidifiers. For my bedroom at night I like to keep the relative humidity around 40-42%. The HWM450 has several advantages. It certainly does ""Quick Steam"" as soon as you turn it on. It has a digital hygrometer which you set to a desired level, and three levels of steam. The heating element is stainless steel.However, the settings take trial-and-error. I ultimately found I had to set the desired RH to 28% on ""medium"" to get 40-42% RH through the night, don't ask me why. The only fault I've found is that when you power it off from the front button it loses your settings (other digital humidifiers keep the setting as long as they remain plugged in). A minor inconvenience.The tank does NOT hold 4 gallons; this measure apparently means the amount of STEAM a full tank can produce. I need to refill it every two to three nights in this dry climate."
4,Humidifier,This is a good product that lives up to it's clams. I do feel it is a little nosier that I had hoped. It would be nice if the humidity sensor would hold the setting desired. I have to set it every night as it defaults back the factory setting. Very easy to clean.
4,worth the investment,"The product does as it promises, it measures room humidity and stabilizes it to your desired level, the timer setting is very helpful since the machine will only run about 8 hours on the water supply it holds...... all in all, if you are looking for a sleep time machine to keep the room humidified, this is good for the price....if you are seeking all day control, its a bit high maintenance for that purpose."
3,rusting screws make for rusty water,"Liked this product, despite having to clean the heating area from calcification. But, once the internal screws started rusting out making a mess in the water and staining the plastic(after 1 month of use) I returned the product to Amazon. They have sent me a new one, but I have not tested it yet. I am hoping they used stainless steel screws this time."
4,Briefly,"Within a couple of weeks of purchase and relatively light use, there was already a significant build up of minerals on the metal element. I followed the cleaning instructions, but that didn't remove the minerals. The element is not, in my opinion, easy to clean. The humidifier works very well, I would just recommend that, if you have hard water you clean it frequently, use filtered water, or distilled water to prevent so much build up. All in all I'm satisfied with it's performance and effectiveness."
4,Wonderful addition!,"I am not a tech nor have I done any research comparing this to other brands. I looked over a few reviews and bought it. My family and I are very happy with the humidifier. It is easy to fill, monitor, and set. The only thing I have to remember is to reset the humidier since it goes back to 55% automatically after each refill. WE like 33%. There is no resude on the table (another BIG plus!) The steam is ultra fine (Almost like a fog. It is VERY quiet on low. When on high, you can hear it ""bubbling"" as it is heating up, but it doesn't seem to wake up my infant. The best thing about it is we don't have to buy all those filters like our old cold air one!"
4,Honeywell HWM450 Warm Moisturizer Humidifier,"The Honeywell Humidifier works well. Setting the percentage of humidity, fan speed, and hours of operation is easy. It produces a pleasant and noticeable amount of moisture in the air. One drawback is the accumulation of mineral deposits. The heating element must be cleaned often and the filter pad must be replaced routinely. Otherwise, a hard calcium-like deposit builds on the plate and is extremely difficult to remove. Overall, however, the unit is quite satisfactory and uses the water in the tank rapidly if the humidity level is set high. There is no question that the warm mist helps to resolve dry nasal passages and coughs due to overly dry air."
1,works well . . . and then it dies,"The unit is a bit tall and the mist points straight up - so don't place it right under curtains or against a wall. The water tank is huge - so a big plus there. Just be prepared to handle the weight of a large amount of water . . . expect the unit to last one winter, then the the heating element overheats the unit and it dies"
3,Honeywell humidfier,"The humidifier overall is good. It is easy to clean, operates well, easy to use, etc. I would definitely recommend it for someone trying to take care of a mid-sized room. However, it does NOT sufficiently take care of the amount of space that it proclaims to. In my dry winter climate, the humidfier had to run at full power all day and night and never even came close to achieving the desired amount of moisture in the air. It's a nice humidifier that works like any $30 humidifier, just with a bigger price tag and a few more buttons."
1,Better off looking for something else,Even when this humidifier works it is mediocre. The whole thing seems to be designed pretty poorly. Filling it with water requires holding the reservoir upside down because it doesn't stand on its own. The whole humidifier must be perfectly level or slightly slanted forward or it won't operate correctly. If it is not perfectly level or slanted forward the heating element won't get enough water and shut off automatically. This was a very poor design since I use it in a room with carpet and with the reservoir on the back all the weight is on the back of the unit. When this humidifier is running it can get pretty loud due to the heating element inside basically boiling the water. It sounds like you're sleeping next to a pot of boiling water. It would also be nice if you could turn off the heat function too.
1,POOR POOR POOR POOR LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS,"LEAKS FROM THE BASE ALL THE WAY AROUND. I MADE SURE THAT I DID NOT MOVE IT AFTER I FILLED IT UP, JUST LIKE IT SAID. STILL LEAKS. I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE NOT BOUGHT IT FROM READING THE OTHER BAD REVIEWS, BUT I DID HOPING THAT MY UNIT WONT LEAK. IT LEAKS. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT. THEY SHOULD TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET."
1,Piece of JUNK!!!,DO NOT BUY. Not a Honeywell product. They just sold the rights to KAZ to use their name.Does not last. KAZ customer service is the worst anywhere!!!! You will just waster your time and then wind up Throwing it away anyhow so just save yourself the aggravation.
1,Not for me,This unit is too complicated to use and has too many things that can go wrong with it. It will shut off for unknown reasons and getting it to work again is a mystery. I have read the manual and came to the conclusion that it is not worth investing this much time to use it. It seems to work fine for a short time and that is why I think you will see some 4 and 5 star ratings.
2,"Good at first, then get ready for the 3-gallon leaks","This worked great for a year. Then, for some reason, it started leaking. All. The. Time. Not good when you need to use it all day or night. Unattended. Which means coming home, or waking up, to a very large amount of water on the floor. The retailer I purchase from no longer sells them (I wonder why?) I would NOT recommend this product and will avoid all Kaz products because of it."
1,Does not work,Did not work right out of the box. A defective product that is going in the trash. Don't waste your money.
2,"Too much work, annoying noises and doesn't prevent snoring!","believe it or not, but my CAT snores LOUDLY at night and the vet said a humidifier would help her stay quiet - however, the humidifier is as loud as the cat, requires extensive cleaning and monitoring and didnt really help the cat...unfortunately it sits unused most of the time now."
3,Won't buy it.,"I am searching for a warm moisture humidifier, this one seems to be a good one. Nice features, reputable brand. However, after read endless bad reviews, I decided to pass it. Everybody should do that so the manufacture will get the message."
2,not so good,"This thing is SO loud that my husband often gets up in the night to shut it off. It doesnt bother me. I really cant tell if its doing its job, its misting but my room is just as dry when I wake up in the morning. and the electronics are faulty, I wouldnt get it."
3,"FRAGILE TANK, otherwise good humidifier","This humidifier worked great for the 2007-2008 winter season, and then the tank fell over in the sink while I was filling it up and cracked. ""No problem, I'll just call the company for a replacement tank,"" I thought. Except that there does not appear to be replacments to be had. I've been trying since last spring to get it replaced and keep getting the same response, ""We hope to get additional stock in 30-60 days,"" every month. After much searching I can't find replacements ANYWHERE.Looks like I have to spend money for a whole new humidifier and will have to be a different manufacturer than Honeywell since I don't want to go through this nonsence again. Too bad."
4,Humidity,"The only problem with this item is after turning it off you will need to reset the humidity level before using again, or you will wake up to windows steamed up and water dripping from the window sills."
1,only worked for two months,"I've only had this humidifier for two months. No matter how thoroughly I clean it, it only runs for a few hours before the ""needs cleaning"" light comes on and it shuts down. I wish I'd paid more attention to all of the 1-star reviews before I purchased."
1,IT LEAKS!,"You would think that the top priority for engineering and producing a humidifier is to MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T LEAK.Unfortunately the idiots who manufacture and sell this device haven't figured that out. I see countless reviews here of leaking machines. Sooner or later it will ruin your floor and/or your carpet, like it did mine. The company should be sued."
2,"Disappointing, Returning for Refund","I so wanted this machine to work out for me. I read reviews til my head hurt and thought this was going to work out in my large living room or large bedroom. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the humidity up over 20%. Also, I had a hard time getting the thing going. It would go on, great, awesome, and stop. I took it apart a few times and finally got it going. I think the mineral filter pad wasn't seating properly. Anyway, I'm returning it and will probably go back to good old fashioned vaporizers (which is what I was replacing)."
4,"works as expected, starts quickly, problem with humidity meter","I am overall pleased with the humidifier. It has definitely made a difference in my apartment in MA during the winter. My unit seems to have a problem measuring the humidity in the air - it switches from showing the real humidity (around 30-35) to just showing 20. It often switches back and forth . I assume this is a problem with the humidity meter. One thing to note is that even on high I can't get my humidity above 35 in the winter, but this is probably the fault of leaky doors and windows in my apartment. One other thing to note is that one tank, if set on high, will not last the whole night, it probably lasts around 6 hours. It is pretty easy to clean, and you must do it about every week - you can physically see the mineral buildup, and need to wipe it off."
3,IT WORKS BUT...,"I have now had the unit for just over one month. It is really only the high setting which is able to maintain a 50-55% humidity when the ambient humidity is in the order of 45%. When on this setting it is noisy, giving a variation of gurgles, burbles, and rattles. The water unit is nicely shaped when it is installed; however, one has to remove the reservoir, turn it upside down and fill it from the bottom of the reservoir which has a larger cross-section that its top. This means that the unit is top heavy and liable to be unstable after a fresh filling of water. I have not been able to find the Honeywell filters on Amazon nor other web stores although I believe I have found another manaufacture's filters which look similar to the ones I should use. But despite these comments the unit does humidify the air and once you get used to the noise of it doing so, one can eventually get to sleep."
4,humidifier,"I have really enjoyed the humidifier. Easy to refill, and very quiet. This is the first humidifier I have owned and I was expecting louder. We keep it in our living room in our apartment and it does the job! I have not been able to find filter refills easily but I chose it because Consumer Reports listed it as a top choice. I am hoping to find refills soon. I would highly recommend it."
3,"Not great, not bad","I purchased this unit because my house is D-R-Y. Every time I went to pet the dog, we'd shock each other. The older humidifier I had was on its way out.This is a good little unit. I have yet to achieve the humidity level of 40, but it churns along nicely. It's not too loud, but isn't whisper quiet, either. However, I had a baby sleeping scant inches from the thing, and she didn't even stir when it did make noise.The water does go quickly, even on the medium setting. However, it's easy to refill, and the humidity it produces is worth the effort. The controls are very easy to understand.I like this product for the price and decent reviews. I'm happy to give it a few weeks and see how it does. So far, good enough."
5,As advertised,"This is a very quick and quiet steam producer for those dry winter heat nights. Worked right out of the box, has filters to catch minerals in the water. Controls are intuitive - except the timer - never figured out how to use it - nor after engaging it, how to override without rebooting. good product."
1,Avoid,"I bougth this for my new born twins room and within three months, it stop working. I have another Honeywell humidifier and that is in operation for over 3 years and with no problem"
2,good product but there are lemons,"I bought 2 of these humidifiers. Like some of the other reviews I've read about, one of them just stopped working. I've sent it back, which was no trouble at all with the help of Amazon's return system, and I hope to receive another one some. It's a good product, I just got a lemon. However, upon saying that, I would buy another one of any brand from a retail store if I could find one."
1,Do Not Purchase This,The tank is very small. It outputs 4 to 5 gallons a day and has a tank 1.2 or so gallons big.Do the math!!! it needs a fill up every 5 or so hours.How much more would a bigger tank cost???????????????????????????????????????????????????
1,"Great while it lasts, if you like cleaning hard mineral crud","Works great for a year and then goes kaput. I've bought one each winter for the past three years. Each time they fail a little under a year. I'm trying the zojirushi brand now. It is twice the price, but after two years I'll come out ahead. We'll see if its worth it."
4,Question on cleaning?,"I have had the Honeywell HWM450 for over a month now and for the size of the room I am using it for, it has worked well. The frequent cleaning of the unit is a MUST to do. Does anyone have any recomkmendations on how to clean the heating plate?? Any solvents safe to use?"
3,"Puts out great steam, but maintenance intensive!","This humidier will FAR outperform any other similarly sized humidifier on the market, but needs maintenance way too often. The directions say to clean it once every two weeks, but after only 4-5 days the water pooling in the bottom (you can see if when you remove the tank for refilling) will turn yellow and the steam being emitted starts smelling musty. The mineral build up on the heating pad is VERY quick (I'm sure this has somehting to do with the water we have), but it seems as if Honeywell could come up with a solution to keep mineral buildup from being such a problem so quickly. The thing works GREAT when it's clean though!"
3,"Works great, easy to clean, then broke 3 years in","So far, the humidifier works just as described. I love the controls and the unit is easy to clean and maintain.Edit; 3 years later.The electronics starting being sketchy, then stopped completely. I've contacted the company and they are going to replace the machine."
2,You can probably do better,"I live in Colorado. It is then low humidity to start with and when you run the forced air heat it gets worse. I don't know if what I experience is normal or not but I'm not thrilled with the amount of time it takes for the filter that sits on top of the atomizing (heating) element to get filled with particulates. I can't find the filters in any store. I then have to pay (always) exorbitant shipping to get something that weighs mere ounces.The refill switch stopped working after 6 months of use. You then have to disconnect the thing from the wall and start over. No big deal really.Now for the reason behind the ** rating. This thing can run constantly at full bore, and I can't get better than 35% humidity local to the sensor. The room humidity has to be lower. Not good enough for $60."
1,What a Mistake !!,"This thing worked good for a couple of days, then started not steaming as much. I replaced the filter after a week thinking that might help. Now I can't go a full day without having to clean the heating element. I can't believe our water has 'that much' calcium.The funny part is my daughter also bought me a $4.97 Vicks warm air vaporizer just before this one arrived and it is putting out more steam, very reliably, than this unit did on it's best day.The latest behavior this one is having is after 10 or so minutes it just stops putting out any steam until it gets turned off and then back on again. It's not like it even got close to the percentage of humidity set for it to reach.Very frustrating and disappointing...."
1,broke,"Loved it at first, but it broke within a week- did not turn on. Even before that the humidistat broke. I am desperate for a good humidifier! I return 1 a season!!!"
1,Sending Back,"The unit worked for about a week, then stoped after running for about an hour each time we restarted it. Cleaned pads and bought new ones,(hard to find) and the problem still exisited.We are mailing it back and hope for a refund?????Don't buy this one."
3,Is great if/when it works....,"I've had two of these and when they work, they are great. But like so many other reviews herein, it just dies on you. After trying two of them, I decided 'no more'."
2,2 Years and Kaput!,"This is the fourth Honeywell warm mist humidifier with electronic controls I have had. When they worked, they were truly wonderful at humidifying the air. However, as with the other three, when I went to start using it at the beginning of the third heating season, it did not work...at all.The ""On"" light would come on but the water would not heat to make steam. The **exact** same thing happened with the previous three humidifiers. So, if you can live with the thing working for only two years, this is a great unit for the price. I guess for +/- $30 a year to keep from having lizard skin and dry sinuses, it's probably worth the money. Just know that you'll probably have to replace it before the third year."
3,It works,"I've had a few humidifies over the years. Most simpler and easier and a bit easier to clean. None that HAD to be cleaned every few weeks like this one. It develops a smell if not cleaned, as others have noted, it builds up deposits, and the pads get filthy FAST. I have to think to some extent the industry has moved to this design, using disposable pads to keep units clean just to sell you more stuff all the time. Otherwise you'd buy a humidifier once every 10 yrs, where's the profit in that?At any rate, it does work. If you set the humidistat all the way up it can run the tank out in less than 12 hours sometimes. By far the majority of the time the tank only needed filling daily, in a 20 x 25 room, heated to about 68 in the winter. Clean it, and it'll keep you happy. Wish I could still get the old model though."
2,Works fine - but clean up can be a chore,"This humidifier works well with its indicators/sensors. However, it SURELY has to be cleaned EVERY two weeks at a minimum. Even with that that there is a lot of build up on the heating plate that has to be removed - with an additional CLR agent/vinegar and not simply wiped away. Also, keep in mind that the mineral pads will have to be replaced regularly though not frequently."
3,480w power consumption on high setting,"I'll comment on the power consumption of this unit since I wasn't able to find information about it before purchasing. It's not on the box, and not in the printed manual either. Guess they really make an effort to hide it. On the back of the unit, it say 4.4 amp.On high setting (default when you turn it on), it consumes about 480 watts of power. On medium setting it consumes about 360 watts. On low setting, it consumes about 230 watts. 230 watts is not bad but 480 watts overnight or 24x7 is a lot.It is slightly louder than I had hoped. But I guess anything that boils water can't be that quiet anyway. On low setting I can fall sleep at night, but I can imagine it may bother some people.The unit is designed really well. I can pretty much take everything apart and wash and clean it. The pieces seem really modular and fit together nicely, and should last quite a while if well cared for."
1,"Bought 2, both broke",We bought 2 just before Xmas. One stopped after 2 weeks; the other lasted 8. We had followed the instructions re regular cleaning and filter replacement (they are high maintenance). What a poor product!
3,I own 6. 2 still work.,"I love these humidifiers. The big, easy to fill tank. The digital humidistat that gets humidity just high enough. The powerful heating element that puts out lots of steam fast.They are great. I feel better in the winter with them running.And they break after a few months. Sometimes the humidistat stops adjusting. Sometimes they just refuse to come on. Or they come on, but the burner never heats. On one, the tank seals broke. Of course, I had spare parts for that one.My advice: watch for the sales and stock up."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SERIOUSLY,I bought this unit and used it for a week and MUST return. It is noisy and it leaked all over my furniture and damage my night stand. My wife is really piss at me now. I should listen to the reviews here about the leaking. Buy it if you want to damage your carpet or furniture. Trust me and you will thanks me later.
3,Works but cleaning is an issue,"This humidifier works fairly well and has a humidistat which is very important. However, the cleaning instructions are cryptic and cleaning has been our major issue. Thank goodness for the reviewer who translated the proper cleaning instructions. Even with frequent change of filters, cleaning with vinegar and bleach as directed, we get a large amount of mineral buidup. The alternative is to bring home about 10 gallons of distilled water per week which is unrealistic. Given that we have to chip the minerals off of the mineral heating plate every week, I doubt this will last that long."
4,About What I Expected,"This is a perfectly good humidifier. I agree with the earlier review that said the tank should have a flat bottom for filling. Even better, a filling lid on top would be nice to allow for topping off the water, rather than having to carry the entire tank.I have a fairly large bedroom and it does OK raising the room from an average 23% to low 40s."
4,Decent Humidifier,"This will do the trick for smaller rooms. It can be loud (it ""pops"" from time to time). Like a lot of humidifiers; you have to clean it often. Haven't had a problem and been using it for a year."
1,Don't buy this humidifier...,"This humidifier was a total disappointment. It was estremely noisy (much more than others from different brands..) and the hygrometer did not work at all. Plus, it broke after not even 2 weeks that he had received it.I don't recommend it."
1,poor product.,"controls are not accurate, nor dependable. a faulty product. would not recommend for any reason. i had to return the unit for credit, after two weeks."
2,hammer time on the humidifier,"When it works, this humidifier does a wonderful job. However, at least once a week it goes on strike. Since we first got it my husband has been dutiful in taking it apart and cleaning it thoroughly. Sometimes it decides to start working again, sometimes it doesn't. Sadly, my husband (who is the most laid back human you will ever meet) decided to have it out with humidifier after spending 30 minutes cleaning - only to have it refuse to get back to work. He dropped a punch on it (which makes me laugh now that I think of it) and it's now headed to the humidifier graveyard. Good riddance."
1,"Don't buy, poor choice of components, rusted screws","While the humidifier worked as advertised, I could not believe my surprise to find the screws inside the machine were rusting. I mean, what kind of engineer would specify steel screws in a humidifier? Maybe some cheapskate on the manufacturing line switched to steel screws, who knows? It's a terrible decision as a humidifier is a worst case situation for steel (duh!). I'm very disappointed. You do need to follow the advice of others for care and cleaning. There is a lot of excess water and the filters can get pretty gross, as would be expected in a humidifier. I gave up because of the rust stains."
1,Fine while it lasted,"The HWM-450, made for Honeywell by Kaz, was purchased for occasional use at a vacation cabin. It lasted for two years, out of which it operated less than two weeks. This year when pulled out of the closet, it will not power on. It is still in warranty. For service, I not only have to pay to ship it back to Kaz, but for their ""handling, packaging, and return shipping."" Even if they ship me a new unit as a replacement, I'm disappointed to pay nearly 50% of the original purchase price for Kaz to fix their defective product."
4,"Original product = garbage, but good customer service","The first one I got was garbage and didn't work right out of the box. It shut down right away and leaked all over the floor like a scared puppy. I called the manufacturer customer service and, fortunately, they sent a new one right away, no questions asked, and a prepaid return shipping label for the bad one.The new one has been going for about a month now and seems to be doing a good job keeping the humidity up despite the woodstove. The water I'm running through it is from my cisten and tends to bulid up minerals and dissolved solids on the heating element, but this is coming off pretty easy with some vinegar once every couple weeks (per cleaning instructions). It does make a little gurgling noise, but it's not too annoying.I don't have another humidifier to compare this one to, but so far, it seems to be doing the job."
1,Had to return twice,While this is a good looking product I had to return it twice because of faulty parts. I would look elsewhere. Seems a shame for such a good brand.
3,Honeywell HWM450 Quick Steam Humidifier,Unit performed relatively as expected. I had no trouble with the fill tank as some have reported. Makes small amount of white noise that doesn't seem to change much with output settings. Noise was drowned out by my daughter's snoring. The first one I ordered stopped working after it automatically shut-off - it wouldn't turn back on (hence three stars). Amazon promptly shipped a replacement. New one seems to be working fine.
1,2 Week Lifespan,"I've read so many reviews that said this unit died after 2 weeks - here's another one. It worked great until one day I went to turn it on... no light, no sound...dead as a doornail. Honeywell wants me to return it to them, then they'd send me a new one, but like others I don't have the original box nor do I feel like spending more money for shipping the dead thing back. Very dissapointed, and wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased it. Save your money & don't buy this humidifier."
1,Piece of junk,"I don't even want to give one star to this product but have no choice. If you really like this product, remember don't let water runs out because most likely it will fall asleep forever."
1,I'm sure it's a nice humidifier...,"I never got a chance to test this unit out since the one I received was, unbelievably, used. Used as in there were the immediately noticable water spots on the tank, used as in mold/mildew on the bottom of the unit.So this review is more directed at Amazon's service than the unit itself. I'm writing this review as somewhat of a warning as to purchasing products from Amazon's ""Kitchen"" department. I also ordered a coffee maker from them that was used as well (including used grinds in the brew thing).Personally, I'll stick with books, dvds and the like and use an alternative method to purchase these types of items."
2,Shocking ConEd bill,The humidifier seems to work fine and did not have any spillage or odour. It has a humidity level control and a indicator but the user control is confusing.The controls should be simple considering its a simple humidifier.I could live with the controls as I got used to it but could not get used to the enormous electricity bill! You definitely need to think twice before buying this product.
4,Works well,I have been using this product for 2 weeks now. It does what it says. I placed this humidifier in between 2 rooms and it does a good job. My only complaint is filling up the water in the tank - it is difficult since it does not have handle on the bottom to hold the tank.
5,Warm mist,Best humidifier I have owned. Bought a second one. Cleans easy and will both really have worked well for over a year. Costs more to run than the cool mist but are quieter and ten times better at humidifying.
1,Disappointed....,"We purchased this December 3, 2007 and today is February 16, 2008 and it is broken. Mind you, we used the mineral pads, did the cleaning, our heating element is still shiny and we used it only at night while we were home. We cleaned it today, plugged it in... no steam. Broke. It would cost us more to send it back than we paid for it, so now we're stuck.It worked great while we had it, all of 2.5 months or so. So if you feel like spending $45-$68 [depending on the current amazon price at your time of purchase] on a humidifier that works for 2.5 months with normal cleaning and use, go ahead. But we are disappointed."
3,"Works great, when it works","Good output, easy to clean and fill, and I like that it shows the current humidity level in the room. Unfortunately it just quit working one day for no apparent reason. Fortunately I had it a little less than a year and it was still under warranty so the company replaced it no problem. I like it so much better than the other humidifiers I've had, just hope the replacement keeps on working. Maybe it was just one of those rare things that went wrong.Update 2012: Have not had any issues with the replacement unit, and have used it for several years. I do not clean it as regularly as they recommend, or replace the mineral absorption pads as frequently as I should, but it continues to perform well and makes our child's room much more comfortable in the dry heat of winter."
1,Unit Failed after 6 Weeks,"After six weeks my unit started continuously shutting off. The manual says this can happen if the unit is not cleaned. However, I did clean the unit and replaced the filter with no success."
2,Broken Reservoir,"Had the unit for a couple months. It had trouble maintaining desired humidity of a small bedroom with the door closed. Overall, a decent unit but not spectacular. Needed cleaning every couple days, but my water is definitely hard -- so it was to be expected.However, after a couple months, I was filling the reservoir and the handle broke off. The reservoir instantly shattered after an 8 inch fall to the side of the bathtub. The handle it turns out uses very poor glue. I had two hands on the reservoir, and was rotating it back to upright position after screwing the cap back on. I would estimate probably maximum 10 pounds of pressure.I would not recommend this unit even if the reservoir hadn't broken. The parts/pads are a pain to get, support is non-existent, humidifier performance/features is nothing to get horny about, and the Kaz company might as well not exist. Honeywell is a name only."
2,Honeywell Misses Badly,"After producing an excellent cool mist unit that has served us well for years, Honeywell has seriously missed the mark with the Warm Moisture HWM450.Pros: heats quickly and emits warm vapor quicklyCons: Let me count the ways:1. Noisy and gurgly, especially on ""high""2. Very fragile switches; returned one to Amazon when it broke, but the replacement has done the same thing within a week3. Will not sit flat in a sink or tub for filling -- poor design4. Plastic water container is quite thin and fragile; we cracked the first one just handling it in the sink, trying to fill it.5. Even though we tried filling it with filtered water, the heating plate and mineral pads solidified quickly.6. ""Humidistat"" on the first unit we received NEVER worked; the second one works in unpredictable fashion.7. Lid to water tank extremely tricky to thread on to the container -- often takes five or six tries!Advice: forego the warm mist and get the Honeywell Cool Mist!"
1,Great...until it fails,"I did my research, but didn't listen to all the comments of the machine just quitting without warning. It was a good machine for about six weeks, although you do have to keep it clean. But one night it just quit. I know I should of listened to the warning of others and kept the box, but I didn't. I definitely recomment that you do not purchase this product."

5,Excellent cake decorating reference,This is one of the best cake decorating books I have. Mr. Winbeckler is amazing and he is a great teacher. All the animals featured in the book are achievable by cake decorators of all levels. The instructions are very simple to follow and you will be making adorable cakes or cupcake characters in no time! I HIGHLY recommend!
4,Cute ideas for those who don't like fondant.,Not as elaborate at modeling with fondant but fondant really isn't all that tasty. The instructions are clear but maybe not for beginners. Cute animal figures for children’s cakes or cupcakes.
3,Good news and bad,"This book was like those ""How To Draw Cartoon"" books that you'd buy at a grocery store. The instructions are basic pictures and some text and the end result is that you get what is on the cover. There are some tips like putting two colors of frosting in the same bag to get a mildly gradient effect and that looks great when used correctly. Overall though, if you aren't looking at the cover and thinking 'this is great!' then save your money because that's what you're getting. I did like this books because it's good piping practice beyond boring squiggles and you'll be able to tell more about frosting consistency. I did not like the figures. The cat and horse were cute with some alterations, but everything else was ... well, let me ask this: how many people can you serve a frosting pig too without them feeling either insulted, confused, or guilty about eatting that cupcake? Might as well write ""Fat @$$"" on it instead."
3,Read Courant & Robbins instead,"I don't like this book. For example, the proof of the key theorem that any ruler-and-compass construction can be carried out with compass alone is 10 pages long and very tedious. There is a much clearer, completely different proof in Courant & Robbins. I find it odd and inexcusable that Martin doesn't even mention this accessible proof. It is true that it uses inversions and that the purest of the pure Euclideans might prefer to avoid it for this reason, but this excuse is not available to Martin since, for example, the proof of Steiner's theorem that any ruler-and-compass construction can be carried out with ruler and one given circle is a half-page analytic magic proof that will have classical geometers turning in their graves."
2,Very Abstract,"The book starts off strong with a thorough review of Euclid's constructions complete with explanations of the constructions themselves. Things go down rapidly from there.Most of the remainder of the book is a very abstract discussion of constructability under various conditions. After the first chapter there are very few concrete constructions performed.If you're looking for a discussion of the theoretical basis of geometric constructions under a variety of conditions this book is an excellent resource. If you're looking for practical, step-by-step constructions that go beyond Euclid you should look elsewhere."
2,Pass on this version.,"This is an edited version of WEF: Going Platinum. Several of the fights from that event are missing as is most of the between round analysis. Also, my copy appeared to be a DVD-r with an ink-jet printed label on the disc. I highly recommend WEF: Going Platinum (especially if you are an MFS fan - you get Matt Hughes, Jens Pulver, Jeremy Horn, Laverne Clarke, and even Pat Miletich himself) but would recommend you pass on this version which only shows about 2/3 of the event."
3,Practical everywhere!,"Talk about finding opportunities anywhere! Derek is the type who would show you that travelling or working long hours aren't excuses for not working out.I first heard about Derek on t.v, and when I purchased his book, I was really impressed by his resourcefulness, something thats really lacking in many publications out here.One of my clients borrowed my book, and she ended up being inspired to buy a ball for her office!-now she wants me to train her at her office.Can I complain?!Derek addresses body intelligence, something that I think is really important to anybody whose exercising, and with this awareness....you could turn your body and any location into your fitness gym.Thanks for the inspiration Derek!"
4,"Fit though busy, through a lifestyle plan that works!","Derek Noble is star of the show URBAN FITNESS TV and imparts the foundations of his popular Hollywood exercise fitness routines here in THE BODY NOBLE: 20 MINUTES TO A HOT BODY WITH HOLLYWOOD'S COOLEST TRAINER. His is a simple, quick method for obtaining a fit body for even the busiest exercises, providing a 'lifestyle plan' which blends all components of fitness - muscle toning, stretching and cardio - in a series of routines which add visualization techniques to help boost effectiveness. Black and white photos pepper the exercises, but it's his in-depth survey of how to blend exercise into daily life which makes THE BODY NOBLE an exceptional guide."
2,You're kidding me right?,"This guy is the ""hottest trainer"" on the scene right now? Give me a break. Aside from a little definition in his chest and abs, he looks like he's never set foot in a gym, at least a real one! He has no development in his back, shoulders, legs or arms, and no wonder: There's hardly any real weight training routines anywhere to be found in this book.Ok, it's not all bad. The nutritional advice is fairly sound, and the book does give you some creative ways to exercise without any expensive equipment or a gym, but let's get real. For the average person to really accomplish a serious body makeover, it takes real training with real weights, and real routines from someone who actually trains.Not a terrible book, it's just that there any so many others that are much better."
1,Don't buy these,"We bought a 30 pack of Pork Earz and my whippet wouldn't touch them. I even tried hiding some beef in one to get him to try it, and it wasn't worth it to him to eat it to get the beef. They smell so horrible he was pushing it away from him."
1,Please dont buy these for your dog,"There are not real pigs ears but some kind of manufactured ears out of Pork skin and chemicals. My dog wouldnt eat them..they smell awful like a chemical smell...we thought maybe he just had to get used to them...left one in his cage..after a week he gnawed on it..eating about 1/3 rd of it and proceeded to vomit all over his cage.....PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE any product such as this which is ""made in China"" should be a red flag I wished I had seen before I fed my poor dog these things. Arent there enough pigs ears in America?"
1,Tragic,Don't waste your money. This is simply six case studies without any explanatory material or purported software. One hundred percent useless! I want to give it 0 stars but 1 is as low as the scale goes.
5,Diggin' it,"I haven't heard this CD in years! I've looked for it in various music stores throughout the years, but never found it ... until a few weeks ago on Amazon.com. This is one of my all-time favorite Celine CD's."
4,One for the evenings,"Funny, became an ice-breaker on several occassions. Love the design on the laces part"
2,"NIce, but...","I ordered a pair of these last year. While extremely comfortable and attractive, these shoes do suffer from a fatal flaw. Namely, the soles are not particularly longlasting: the (manmade) midsole split on both shoes of the pair.Discovered on a rainy day, of course...my socks were drenched."
5,This top is tops!,"If you never considered getting a top for your child, you should. I remembered when someone bought one for my son (who is now 21) and he loved it. Good ones are hard to find. This is a good one. I bought two at Christmas and think they are very cool. My son (age 2 1/2) is very inquisitive and he loves to watch it go. It has survived his destructive tendancies as well!"
1,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed. My mother had a top similar to this as a child. We purchased this one and it did not live up to expectations. The top has to be pushed down very hard and fast for the train to make noise. It is difficult for small children and the fun fades very quick. It is a toy that will be used once or twice and then discarded.
5,This CD is Fabulous!!,"What a fun, fantastic CD! It grows on you each time you listend. ""Now you know"", is a great high energy song, ""Close your Eyes"" a beautiful ballad...""So Physical"" is great fun too. Song compositions are varied and interesting...this band is going places!! Buy the CD you will be happy you did!"
3,I Am The Happy!,"Excuse my lame title, but it took me Five minutes to come up with it, I doubt If I sat any long I could do better.I believe this is a fun album. What, with the like of all these Dance/Pop/Punk/Rock outfits out there nowadays, it's no doubt that someone would do it with originality. Not JUST originality (because we all know those people are a dime a dozen nowadays) but with style, and soul, and good muscianship.Buy this album if you like Cobra Starship, Fall Out Boy, Panic! At The Disco, and so forth. It's different, so dont expect all these Heavy Synth Fake Techno beat stuff, expect that kind of music done with real instruments and real muscians."
2,The MOONRAKER of the Sharpe movie series,"It give me no pleasure to write this review. After years of thoroughly enjoying Cornwell's Richard Sharpe novels I finally caved in and picked up one of the films. SHARPE'S GOLD is one of my favorite of the novels so I figured I'd chosen well.I was wrong.This movie is to the novel as MOONRAKER was to Ian Flemming's work.Sharpe is indeed in the movie, and I think the word ""gold"" is uttered once or twice, but that's where the similarity ends.Highly disappointing.The only reason I gave it two stars is Sean Bean - who really does fullfil my image of Richard Sharpe.Read the book. Don't waste time or money on this movie."
1,"""Sharpe's Gold""","I have literally just finished watching ""Sharpe's Gold"" on DVD, I don't have the words to describe my disappointment. It's story line was in such poor taste I had to immediately submit a review.My recent purchase of the Sharpes's series 1-6 has been shadowed by this absolutely horrible interpretation of the excellent book ""Sharpe's Gold"" by Bernard Cornwell. ""Sharpe's Gold"" the film would have made a much better ""Doctor Who"" episode. I consided myself a collector of the Sharpe series and have read the entire collection. I find it hard to believe that Bernard Cornwell actually allowed them to completely trash his book for his film.I will continue to collect the rest of this series, however my copy of ""Sharpe's Gold"" will be collected by the garbage men next Tuesday."
2,not a good book for beginner,"If you are new to ASP.NET, this is not a good book for you. I don't understand why the author did not have the actual code in the download samples. If he don't want to share his code, why bother to write the book? We the beginners need to have the actual code to play with it, not just reading the examples!!!"
2,not a good book to learn / reference,"I read two books of this author, and I find he try to make simpel thing complex. This book is very dry, even you feel thursty sometimes. No real examples or code, just explanations. And over 1000 pages, the exaplanation is still there. I find most of the thing is from MSDN, and not worth the money. I will throw it away. Never buy it."
1,If your writing an MS Book you should use their product.,"I was hoping for something more along the line of Murach's ASP.NET with VB.NET where the examples are done using the IDE. That's why I never cared to much for Petzoid, except in the very beginning when all there was was Quick C for Windows. Murach's C# book is great if you just want to do Windows apps, but they do not cover ASP.NET using the language. I'm really sorry I spent the money on this book.It seems crazy to resort to what could be line edited code when you have a very powerful tool."
3,"Pretty good, but I prefer the o'reilly","I found the book to be generally decent all round. But find myself picking up the o'reilly more often.I guess I'd like the book if I hadn't seen another. I bought the book because I assumed that a MS Press book should have a lot of detail. However I found that it went over the basics well but didn't offer a lot of detail. I feels like the book expects you'll be looking up MSDN for detail. Also, even though there is a ""real life"" section in the book, I found that the examples, while decent, didn't offer as much insight into the practical use of things like controls. I'm not a very creative person and examples that go a little beyond the literal use of a feature helps a lot in giving me insight into the many ways I can use it.Like I said, decent book. I'd like it if I didn't have something to compare it against."
3,"Lots of info, but doesn't separate practical info","Although he does a good job of providing a lot of information about ASP.NET, Esposito neglects to separate details of the .NET framework's internal workings from the practical information that developers need to know to build real apps with ASP.NET. This makes for some very dry reading and it can be difficult at times to figure out how to accomplish the day-to-day tasks needed in web application development."
2,The real gems in this book are few and far between,"Dino has a knack of making simple things complex, and I strongly believe the 1000+ pages can be reduced to less than 250 without losing any real value.This is partially due to his poor command of the English language, but what's so irritating is his frequent use of uncommon terms and phrases to show off his ""mastery"" of the language (especially the word ""orthogonal""). The editor must have slept on the job as well.The whole book tastes like sand, but there are occassional insights that can help recover the cost of it, and that's where the 2 stars come from.Another bigger complaint against this title is that it doesn't show you how to build a real world application; just snippets of code here and there, with no clue at all about how to piece them together.It seems that Dino is far more keen on impressing his readers than delivery of value."
5,A good book for experienced programmers,"This book covers a lot of in-depth information about ASP.NET 1.1. Its well-organized information is very useful for us to save precious time in searching and exploring. Thanks a lot, Mr. Dino Esposito.Suggestions for the author:(1) Use more graphical presentations if possible (could be more concise and organized)(2) Please add more real-world code samples!!! - a bit boring to read dry descriptions"
5,"looking, looking.","This fits a 50's style Marlin 22mag rifle. I had been looking for a scope mount for 12 years.. No one had them.Living in a rural area, with livestock and outdoors pets, keeping varmints at bay means sometimes you have to shoot at greater distances.. That rifle always needed a scope and now it has one.The distributor was quick on delivery, the price was reasonable.. good experience all the way around.."
4,Good for the price,"I bought these mainly to wear around the house because they were on sale. I like them because they are light and comfortable but still warm enough that I don't get a chill when I have to quickly go outside in the winter. I like the fact that they're fabric which breathes nicely when I'm sitting around. My only problem is that my wife says the fabric doesn't hold it's shape well enough when I'm wearing my boxers, unlike my thicker sweat pants that have a thicker material. But for lounging around or even exercising in cool (non-windy) weather, these are not bad at all."
2,good easy to move in pants,I ordered the same size I all ready had. When they came they were way toosmall. The shipping was good price was good but they were sized wrong Iregifted then as a gift to my son.
2,Warm sweat pants...,"I tried to purchase warm heavy sweat pants on the web...When they arrived, they were very light weight. Too light to take camping in spring or fall. I was dissapointed. Carl-Russell power Propel pants."
2,Mostly disappointing,"Well, I must say that of all the ""Circle of Magic"" series that I've read, ""Daja's book"" was the most disappointing. There wasn't enough plot and action to make the book one that a reader could not put down, unlike her previous 2 books. Those were simply marvellous, and mst importantly, got me hooked onto her books. Still, even though this latest book of Tamora's is not up to her standard, it is still not bad, if you don't compare too much. Anyway, why is everyone so sure that Briar and Sandra will end up together? I love these two characters and will also support their romance if there is one, but how did anyone glimpse this information in ""Daja's book""? I couldn't find a clue to it. Anyway, really waiting fervently for her forth book ""Briar's book""! Hope it will come soon!!"
5,Too lazy to come up with a title. O_o,"Okay, so I've never read this book. However, I do want to say something to that last reviewer who gave it one star. When a charcter is facing a moral dilemma, it is always interesting and never mushy, in my opinion. Even if the decision would be obvious to the reader, the deep emotional turmoil going on inside of the character should make it an interesting read, and if you have any sensitivity whatsoever, it should stir at least some emotions in you. It is this sort of thing that I have always admired Tamora Pierce for, and you should too."
3,Too Straightforward Plot-wise,"Before I read a single page, I thought this would be a story about Daja's eventual acceptance of her place in Trader Society, with the backdrop of a huge fire (that's her element). Yep, that's the book.The Iron Vine and Sandri's power-mapping/untangling were the only unique plot elements, and they didn't change the course of the actual story. Overall, the least interesting book in the Circle of Magic series."
4,"I'm an oldie, but I still read","Yes, it's me again, and I like Tamora Pierce so I've finally gotten around to reading this reissue. I prefer the knighthood series, but these are good, too."
4,A GREAT BOOK,"Daja's book is a great book.Not as good as her others, but it's up there in rank.It's got me waiting for the 4th book.{the one I really want.'Cause it's about Briar!} Had a nice plot, nicely written.One to buy in hardcover! Guess to what will happen in the 4th:Briar and Sandry!What a great match!It's a classic:Noble falls in love with thief."
3,About the title...,This is just a re-titled copy of Daja's Book in the Circle of Magic quartet - don't get confused by the title!
5,What's in a Name,I noticed that several other reviews on this page were asking whether this book was the same as Daja's book and it is. Fire in the Forging is the UK title for Daja's book like Healing in the Vines is the same as Briar's Book.I really enjoyed this book although I liked the Tortal books a little better I think that the Circle of magic books are a great read. Of all of the circle of magic books Daja's Book is my favorite.Part of the reason I enjoyed it was it really went into the details on the traders and enjoyed hearing about another of the cultures that Ms. Pierce has created. As usual for Ms. Pierce the characters were well and colorfully written so by the end of the book you felt lie you knew them.It was a fun story and if you choose to read it I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
3,...,"I have to say I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did the other ones in The Circle of Magic. I was rather let down.I do recomend other Tamora Pierce books though, the Tortall books in particular.Just in case anyone was wondering, The Fire in the Forging IS the retitled name of Daja's book. Happy reading."
1,Kindle book under review still? Please hurry.,Title says it all. I have enjoyed the series so far and i am anxiously awaiting the next book in the series (#3). I hope the publisher hurry's up with the review already!update 6/22/2012....still under review...hurry hurryupdate 8/31/2012 ..... still under review.....
2,No scrubby brush included,When shipped this product does not have the scrub brush that is shown in the picture. The set itself looks pretty cheap in real life.
3,Not exactly,"The item arrived quickly and in great package. Everything was as described, except I don't think it is ""solid copper"". The inside of the container looks like tin or aluminum. Overall, beautiful item and fits perfectly on the countertop without being too obstructive."
4,Fear rules,Not a lawyer found the writing somewhat turgid and slow; on the other hand our decision making and valuation of life and risk is certainly not epistimic. Read just before the Black Swan which discusses risk from a different angle. For those involoved in lives with risks this is interesting reading
5,Don't Let the HotDog Fool You! These guys are GREAT!,This Tom Chaffee & The Saturnalia album shows their range of instrumental capabilities - and it certainly is a great BLUES ROCK album!
5,An excellent book,"This is a follow up of ""working towards enlightenment"". Both translated from the single volume Chinese book titled ""how to cultivate the Buddhadharma."" J.C. Cleary has once again done a very fine job. The translation is lucid and beautiful in its own right. Literally inclined cultivators will cherish the many poems which are probably translated for the first time."
5,WISH YOU COULD HAVE BEEN THERE,"Townes recorded at the Jester Lounge, Houston, in 1966--this is the place were Townes started singing,joking,to an audience-the recording, considering the date is excellent--tunes include covers,talking blues, and some early Townes songs.If you love Townes as so many do,you need this,it is a part of Texas music history, and it gets no more better than that. Support this release--who knows what else is out there?"
4,Great for the price,"For the price it's a great deal. I made some modifications to it. The poles are too short for my needs. I replaced them with two 10 foot pieces of thin wall electrical conduit and drove two 12 inch pieces of 1 inch pipe in the ground to place the poles in. This gives you the height and you don't need the side ropes. After the initial set up, It sets up and take down in less than a minute. I would buy another when it wears out."
3,chunndar,This net works well but takes two to set up. It's easy to shoot wide on this net because it recomends that you stand 10 feet back. I found standing closer works better and long clubs are recomended.
1,Broke the first time I set it up.,I would not recommend this product. The first time setting it up out of the box and one of the joints broke. Its got these little plastic pieces that join the pole pieces together and one of them broke in half over the stress of the net.
1,Awful,"If I could give this item a half star or less I would. I was happy and satisfied with this product for all of about 5 hits. It appears that the saying ""you get what you pay for"" is justifiable in this circumstance. Therefore, I recommend the company that manufactures this product to either a) put a caution tag saying that only toddlers with swing speed less than 20mph use this product or b) they make the awful excuse for plastic rods reinforced. After about the 6th hit or so with my irons the net successfully rebounded the ball back, I looked down at the ball, looked back up at the net to be disappointed with the sight at hand, the plastic pole was literally snapped in half. Don't buy this product unless you want about three and a half minutes joy."
4,Good for the price,"Before buying this I saw a lot of complaints it wouldn't hold up, however, I also noticed every single practice net had the same complaints because people were using regular balls. I bought practice balls that work great for cheap. My only complaint is the net needs to be taller, once you put it into the ground you lose a foot of height and its easy to hit over by accident, I would say another 18"" in height would be perfect. Overall still a good buy for the price."
3,Average product for good price,Net probably sets up easier with two people vs. one. Size is probably adequate if you have some golfing skills. I use it predominantly in my back yard with practice balls not regular golf balls. It works great for these type of balls. Has remained sturdy at this point.
4,Decent for the price,This item is a pretty good deal for the price.Setup was pretty easy as long as the soil wasn't too dry. But not as easy setting up other types of tent-like golf practice nets.
4,4 stars,I ordered only one net but by mistake I ordered two I tried to cancel the second order but was unable to successfully contact you. So in the end I kept both of the nets? There should be a way of cancelling an order if you make a mistake. I tried for about 30 minutes but could not reach you. The net was wonderful I just did not need two of them. Thank you for letting me finally reach you.
2,Bare basics,This book does little justice to 10th Planet BJJ. I would look for Mastering the Rubber Guard book if you want to review basics.
5,Jiujitsu unleshed,good book. lots of good storyline and technique instructions. Needs better angle for the pictures of the techniques.
1,Overhyped,"This book is way overhyped. The stuff shown is not for everyone, if you are not specially flexible and very short most of the techniques will be difficult to execute to say the least.The introduction makes it sound like the author is a widely recognized master and he is not. Also the back cover mistates the book contents showing alack of attention to detail.The picture angles are not very good and the pictures are not clear. Low production value created a cheap book that is good for some but not for most."
5,Awesome Protection,This surge protector was recommended to me by a co-worker that knows his stuff. He said this is the best proctection for your PC equipment even though it is marketed as protection for your home theatre.Very easy to understand and has all the bells and whistles that you need from wire fault lights to plugs that provide higher protection as you go up the strip.
1,A&E Magnificent Amberons remake,"A crashing disappointment. Despite the hype of using Welles' ""original screenplay"", it is evident that director Arau was determined to avoid any hint of Welles' inspired narrative & cinematography. Result: bland city throughout. At 1/10 the budget, Welles 1942 film achieved ten times the artistry in 88 minutes vs. A&E's nominal four hours."
2,4 reasons for watching this:,"1/ You were not sure Orson Welles was a genius, so you needa comparison with the same basics (his script)2/ You're allergic to black & white movies3/ You're more interested in munching pop-corn, and do'ntwant distraction by a more compelling show4/ You're so much addicted to TV style that you can't standany longer quality movies with perfect acting and directingBut for those, I can't think of ANY REALLY GOOD reason for this remake"
4,A Magnificent Cast,"I found the cast delightfully over the top, and thoroughly enjoyed the mugging and pouts from Jennifer Tilly and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. I have never seen Gretchen Mol give an interesting performance, but she manages to hold her own.I'm sure it's not what Arau intended for his film, but the results are still highly entertaining."
1,Anything but Magnificent,"Poor casting, poorer acting, difficult to swallow, with a forced conclusion (why did I bother watching it that long?)."
1,TV movie bilge,"Ten seconds in Orson Welles' film communicates more than ten minutes in this one. Everything is lost except the melodrama which is plodded through quite boringly. The middle-American haute bourgeoisie that Welles' portrayed have become Soap-Opera-land millionaires (contrast Aunt Fanny in Welles' actually making sandwiches with this Aunt Fanny being served from a silver tray) and the way in which Welles' succeeded in capturing so brilliantly what it must have felt like to watch the car eclipse the horse is gone entirely. A film masterpiece has been reduces to a second-rate version of Dynasty. Welles' film, by the way, was no doubt far superior in its uncut original state--but the truncated version still works. It stands by itself because every second of it is made to count."
1,Snort!,"They snort, they scream, they roll their eyes. Experienced readers will recognize that any of those things are a bad sign. Here we have all three, sort of like a bad day at the bull paddock. Eventually I simply lost interest but my impression is that top level bankers are prepared to kill, die, and otherwise go crazy for? You guessed it, mortgage descrimination by evil white guys!!! Oh, and they all seem to gulp bar wine. And the heroine is a brave, intrepid bank executive who is afraid to fly. And the hero? Well, it would be unfair to those of you who might like this book. Actually for aficiandos of bad writing who are willing to spend an hour skim reading it is not a bad deal."
2,Boring and Predictable,"I agree with the reviewer who called Silent Partner silly. I read this book through page 50 and then started skimming. Since the ending was very predictable, I doubt I missed much."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"this my first time reading this author and my last. this a story about a billonaire seeking help from a women because of incident in her past. of course, we are not sure who or what he is, or why he really needs her help when he has all the money in the world and she is a nobody. this story only becomes more absurd at the conclusion. SAVE YOU MONEY!"
3,"Entertaining, predictable & silly","One of the wealthiest men in the world has a job opening. He needs a smart, athletic, beautiful woman who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. How very original? He finds a woman who fills the bill and more.Silent Partner is entertaining, but like a fairy tale that you have heard several dozen times, it is also predictable. I enjoyed the easy plot, even though it was silly.This is a commuter book. Little concentration is required to follow the plot. At the end of the tale you will have been entertained and will chuckle to yourself when you remember that I warned you that Silent Partner is predictable and silly.Three stars and no more."
1,1 Star all the way,I absolutely agree with all the other one star reviewers and have nothing more to add except that this author continues to go down hill... as if he is fulfilling a deadline for an advance already spent.
1,"Silly, infantile, inane, and poorly written",Frey's America is rife with racists of all stripes controlling the industrial and financial machinery that runs this country. The book starts out with some fraternity boys killing a ... for good measure. It then goes on to explain that despicable racists are running the major financial institutions in Richmond. Their conversations are the sort contrived in the fetid overwrought imagination that only a devout Leftist could possibly believe in. Conspiracies lurk everywhere. The dialog is simply awful. Unless you're a dyed in the wool Democrat who believes that Dubya stole the election and that Algore would have made a terrific president don't bother with this piece of tripe.
2,Incognito,"I love reading these reviews after I've finished a book and find I agree with so many other reader/reviewers. The revelation of who was really whom in this crazy story was really hard to swallow. Everyone out trying to trip up the other guy and Angela like a puppet on a string. It's amazing how much time she could spend running around the country and still keep her full time job. How do authors dream up this stuff, following Howard Hughes around? Getting from the lodge to the mountain cabin was totally out of reason, in the dead of winter? With bad guys lurking everywhere? Forgeddaboutit."
2,Snore!,"This book is definitely not his best. After reading The Take Over and Inner Sanctum, I expected much better. The story was just too predictable and not a very good read."
3,Somewhat Beleivable,"Poor little rich girl meets the richest man,at least in the USA. Lots of intrigue if you can believe it. Some very good twists and turns that keep you reading. I have enjoyed all his books but this one is just not my cup of tea. I will try others though as all good authors sometimes hit you with one that just isn't right for you."
4,4 1/2 stars,"See book summary above.As usual, I can count on Stephen Frey to write an entertaining and gripping novel. With his past in the field of investing, Mr. Frey knows of what he writes.Filled with some twists and some turns, this some time intricately plotted novel will give the reader alot of enjoyment.Recommended."
2,Not impressed with service,"I can't speak for the product, since I cancelled my order before it arrived. I ordered the item in November and when I still hadn't rec'd it by January, I decided to cancel the order. I also felt the shipping was really high for this item. The company offered me a discount for waiting which I accepted, in December, but when it was still taking too long to get, I decided to cancel the item all together and look locally for the item."
3,Expected more for the price,"The construction, assembly and purpose of this shoe bench was satisfactory. The only thing I really didn't fully enjoy about the product is purely aesthetic. I find the pictures somewhat misleading from the product that arrived. The bench's brown colour seemed like it was ""spray painted"" on. There were chips and scratches on the edges revealing the expose lighter raw wood underneath. But I didn't want to go through all the trouble to exchange it. Other than the looks the bench was really simple to put together and seems pretty stable and serves it's purpose well. I just wish the finish was a bit better.J"
5,bench,"Super easy to put together, looks nice. But keep in mind like the other reviews there is not enough room between shelves for mens shoes."
1,Top veneer separated; discarded,"My experience may be an atypical manufacturing defect or shipping problem. Other reviews are positive.The bench top arrived with large sections of the walnut veneer cracked and separated, apparently the result of improper gluing. Within two weeks, large portions of the top veneer had separated, cracked, and broken off. Return shipping for a replacement was too expensive, so I discarded the bench.But for the defect, I would have given it a good rating. Inexpensive (shipping was more than purchase price; total was still reasonable), functional, easy to assemble. Good size for a hallway or entrance."
4,Shoe Bench,"This shoe bench is very nice, easy to assemble, and fits perfectly in my condo. the only downside to this is that it doesn't fit larger shoes/short boots, but it still does the job well. i mainly got it for my son who loves to just throw his shoes around, so i thought this would be a good place for him to keep them organized. he also uses it as a little table to do his homework and color, i am happy with this product!"
4,Really Nice Bench!!!,"I couldn't believe how nice this bench was for the cost. The quality was exceptional. The wood finish is beautiful and consistent across the legs, shelves, and top. All of the holes for assembly were perfectly drilled. Assembly seriously took me 10 minutes, with two kids going crazy around me!Easily comparable to products twice the cost.The only reason I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars is that you can see the hardware on the front. Most may not find this a distraction, but I would have preferred the hardware being made of oil-rubbed bronze so it blended more seamlessly into the bench's visual. But again, just my personal taste and not truly a knock on the product."
3,Sturdy bench,"The bench is sturdy and holds shoes, so gets at least an okay from me. I only took stars away because the veneer came bubbled on the top. The color was nice. If it was, or appeared to be solid wood, it would have been beautiful."
3,wood bench,Size and shape are function for what we needed. Quality of paint or stain was inconsistent on the 2 lower shelves.
1,"This is not a cd to be proud of, sorry","I don't know what Sally was thinking while putting this cd together, but this cd is short of being a bust, in my opinion. There were very few songs on this cd that I enjoyed. For one thing, I think Sally tried to be too flashy and too spectacular on this cd. I would have preferred a much more laid back sound. Also, I didn't think the repertoire was that good.I would like to say something in Sallys' defense, that being Sally is a great pianist, probably one of the best in the U.S.A. The problem comes with every great performer about when to shine, and when to hold back. I believe on the songs played on this cd Sally should have held back a little.It also appears that the piano Sally used, needed some repairs. For example, on ""Clair De Lume"" I keep hearing the petal being released. This distracted from the performance of this song.Recommendation: I Can Not Recommend This Cd"
2,Disappointing,"Despite the promising title this book contains little extra information on trekking and other adventurous outdoor pursuits in remote parts of Indonesia.In fact it barely covers even the better-known parts of each region - you are better off buying a Lonely Planet or Rough Guide for practical travel information, or a Periplus guide for in-depth detail."
4,Dali His Clocks Straight Now,"Salvadore Dali of art fame has written this novel in a attempt to explain modern art, the nuevo and contemporary look we see through his ""Persistence of Memory Piece"". The book explains the concepts of modern art and paiting in a way that is informative and exciting. Dali makes the reading interesting,"
4,good service,The box was damaged (the back was a bit beat up and the top was cracked). Service was speedy. The disk itself was seemingly new. Would buy from them again.
5,"A tender, sweet and funny movie","I missed seeing this movie when it hit the theatre but caught bits and pieces of it on TV years later - and fell in love with it. I rented it twice and finally bought it. Not having grown up in a part of the country where racism was obvious, the interracial relationships that develop in the movie were interesting to watch. When you see little Molly's simple adoration of Corrina - if adoration can be defined as simple -it gives me hope that maybe one day people will look past the color of one's skin before they make a judgement call. Perhaps the most moving moment in the movie - and there are several - was the ending when Manny Singer, a self-confessed athiest lifts his eyes to heaven and asks God for help. What can I say except that this movie is very special and definitely worth watching many times."
5,Every kid should have a nanny like Whoopi,"This is an AWESOME movie. Whoopi plays the part Corrina with such heart and such fun, that every kid who sees her will want her for a nanny.Ray Liotta is perfect for the part of the widowed father. Corrina Corrina runs the gamet of emotions. A must have for your video or dvd collections!:)"
4,WHOOPI AND TINA SHIE,"I loved this movie i frist discoverd may years ago. since then i have watched it many times. it is so good. it makes you both cry and laugh. young tina majorin is great. the movie also featuress one of my other favrite child actors, courtland mead in a small role. watch this movie if you want ot be entertained."
5,Definitely 5 stars,"What's not to like about this movie? Whoopi is hilarious, as is Joan Cusack -- both as maids, although Whoopi is the classier of the two. Liotta is the perfect grieving husband. And best of all, Majorino is perfect as the darling daughter who opens up because of the new help. I absolutely loved her singing!!Perfect in every way -- romantic, touching, funny. Whoopi has never looked so beautiful."
4,A really feel good movie,"I really love this movie. There have been other movies about interracial relationships (between a Black Woman and White Man) however they are not as geniune as Corrina, Corrina. The chemistry between the actors who portray Corrina, Manny and Molly is amazing. I agree that there are some funny and heartbreaking moments in this movie. It is very entertaining and uplifting. This films really affirms that love is blind and that people aren't born to be prejudiced, prejudice is learned. Molly did not see Corrina's color nor that of her new playmates."
1,corinna corinna,"I received this DVD and it had several whole sections where it skipped! I was unable to watch about a third of the movie. It was very frustrating. I would like to replace it, and have asked for instructions because it did not have a packing slip. But Amazon did not reply."
2,very average,this film never quite gets off the ground.Whoopi Goldberg&Ray Liotta just don't have any real Chemistry.it feels Artificial for the most part.these two talents are capable of Better than this.
2,Dont waste the Cash,THis was a attempt at DRY Humor....give me a glass of KOL-Aid...I am totally parched.....Didi not like it and paid to see it in the theatres...I know it did not get any better on video....UHHHHHHHHH
5,"Corina, Corina order",We've been looking for this movie for a long time for my daughter. One of her favorites (she's 22). I ordered and received within 3 days in time for her b-day.
5,Great Movie!,"Great movie, educational in a sense. This movie makes me laugh. I will share this with my friends."
5,greatest hillbilly hick flick ever man,"The second in the Coen's hillbilly trilogy, Raising Arizona is vintage Coen before there was such a thing as vintage Coen. This film has influenced both subtle and outrageous comedies, and everything in between. Watch this film once to relax and twice to learn, only three times to charm the pants off of any girl named edwina. With a capitol E."
4,you need to give the film some time to love it,"I've just bought it and I am sure I'll end up loving it just like the other Coen movies I own. But the first viewing was a kind of disappointment. Only seeing it for the 2nd and 3rd time(it was a weekend) was I able to appreciate the gems scattered all over the movie. The question I ask myself is do I really like this film or having invested 30$ in that DVD I convince myself I have to like it? It's evident you can watch Coen's movies on different levels and the reviewers who advice us to rent Moonstruck to enjoy the romantic comedy will probably see Miller's crossing as a ""gangster movie"". I am not sure where to place it and the twing of hopes not fulfilled is present. Anyway it's a film to see if you are not a fan of the visually sophisticated idiocy like Blade or Star Wars Episode 1 or Julia Robert's ""romantic comedies""."
3,Reminiscent of the humorous two-dimensional anarchy of Warner Bros. cartoons...,"For all the visual flair and deft performances on display in their films, the Coens' greatest virtue lies in writing... In terms of cheerful stories, witty dialog and the creation of a coherent, plausible fantasy world peopled by vivid characters, their ability to work original and entertaining variations on a genre indicates well for the future...Opening with a brilliant pre-credits monologue, ""Raising Arizona"" tells of an incompetent, compulsive petty criminal's love for his prison warder: married but infertile, the couple kidnap a baby, whose tycoon father hires a crazed biker to find and kill the culprits... A surreal, slapstick satire, it takes intense pleasure in exciting plotting, showy and cheap colors, and hilarious screwball characters..."
4,Rasing Arizona,"Nicholas Cage in Raising Arizona was one of his early comedies and also one of his funniest! Cage is H.I. (or Hi) and his wife Ed (Holly Hunter) finds out that she barren and that she can't have children. At the same time they find that out, they also find out that the king of unpainted furniture, Nathan Arizona, and his wife give birth to quintuplets.Hi and Ed feeling that it was unfair that some should have so much and others so little that they make a plan to take one of the Arizona children and raise him as their own. In a trashy, laugh out loud sort of way, they pull it off only to realize that they had done the wrong thing that they have to bring the baby back. Very funny movie and just loads of fun.This movie is seriously the reason why Jeff Foxworthy made it so big. This is a total backwater hick comedy that keeps you laughing the whole way through. Very funny movie and if you're looking for other great Nicholas Cage movies, check out CON AIR and FACE OFF."
5,Funniest Movie of All Time,"Seriously...even better than the classics...Caddyshack, etc.This is one smart, funny movie that will stand the test of time."
5,Funny,I thought that this was one of the funniest movies ever. A great buy. It'll keep your attention. Don't listen to some other reviews who's husbands thought it was a total waste of time. Great movie. Great acting. Great price. Great deal.
5,Mesmerizing,"The Coen brothers have not made a bad movie, and I am hard pressed to name a favorite. This is the first of their movies I ever saw so it holds a place in my heart for getting me hooked on their movies. Funny beyond belief yet touching on many levels. My only complaint is Holly Hunter's accent which ironically seems fake to me yet she has a Southern accent. Go figure."
5,I can't stop laughing! :),"I've seen this movie many times, and never get tired of it. There are so many memorable lines. ""Government do take a bite, don't she?"" The characters are so alive and crazy! The storyline is even crazier. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I can never forget HI's hair!"
3,"Eh, what's the big deal","The Coen's have a devoted following of which I'm not a part of. I'm going over the hightlights of their oevre to try to make sense of it. This film combines some off-elegant, poetic dialogue juxtaposed with zany comedy theatrics. However, the overall impact of the comedy is moderate at best. Some of the irreverence hits home, but a lot has worn rather tritely. The motiffs praised by some as insightful are rather superficial, providing only a mesotrophic layer of insight. The cheesy furnitures salesman and the B.O. challenged biker were cute though wore-out their welcome. For me, the Coen's are creative without breaking through."
1,"Love the movie, disappointed in the DVD release","Looking forward to HDTV? If so, don't waste your money on this release of your favorite movie. I have been waiting for quite some time for the release of Raising Arizona on DVD, but a letterbox format just ain't going to cut it. If you are unaware of the difference between a letterbox version and an anamorphic 16x9 version of DVD, I recommend you read http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/anamorphic/ for the info. Quote: ""To knowledgeable DVD fans, seeing the terms ""16x9"" or ""anamorphic"" on a disc is like having the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. It tells them that in today's blistering consumer electronics marketplace, where change and obsolescence can happen in the blink of an eye, the DVD they're spending their hard-earned cash on is at least a little future-proof. And that's important."" Amen!"
1,This DVD is NOT Widescreen 1.85:1 as claimed (it's 4:3 letterboxed),"This is my favorite movie of all time, but as so often is the case, the reviews here reflect the film, not the actual product.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.Unfortunately I didn't watch the disc until a month after I received it, and my window for returning to Amazon had expired. SUPER LAME, especially considering the information describing the disc is a blatant lie.The description on Amazon and the description on the box both claim ""Widescreen 1.85:1.""This transfer is absolutely 4:3, letterboxed to 1.85:1. That means if you watch this movie in native resolution (without zooming and reducing picture quality), there will be black bars all around the picture (not just at the top and bottom. If you zoom to fit the screen, the picture quality is awful (because the pixels are enlarged past native resolution).Again, this DVD transfer is NOT widescreen. It is letterboxed 4:3.DON'T BUY THIS DVD."
2,RAZING RAISING ARIZONA,"Now, don't ch'all get me wrong, I enjoys me an offbeat comedy as much as the next person. Heck, I myself am as ""offbeat"" as it gets this side O' the cuckoo's nest. And yeah, I chuckled two, maybe three times during the course of this one and a half hour movie. But that ain't a good laughs to minutes ratio, boys `n' girls. Problem is, I prefer my offbeat comedies to be funny...I'm funny that way.I s'pose I can see why some O' the people of Airheadzona might think this is a great comedy...after all, Airheadzona's collective I.Q. rating is commensurate with its average temperature during the dog days of Summer. But what excuse does the rest O'Yous have?Not to worry; I'm a-gonna buy each and every one O'Yous a REAL, fully-developed Sense O'Humor for Christmas this year. (Provided The Comedy Store has `em on sale. I doesn't like to pay me full price!)"
4,Very good,"Holly Hunter is wonderful as an infertile woman desperate for a baby, so desperate she talks her husband into stealing a baby from an older couple who have 'more than their fair share' of infants. Great humor, and despite the kidnapping, a happy ending.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,Off-Kilter Humor for Those Wanting More than Adam Sandler,"This movie made me laugh out loud, which not enough comedies do. It is filled with dry, almost throwaway lines that make rewatching the film a pleasure as you detect and savor the ironies and skewed views on life. I bought it on VHS, and now DVD. I was astounded when a friend of mine told me he didn't like it at all - one reason he gave is that the plot is about kidnapping a baby in order to create a ""normal"" family, and he thought that was sick. But then I found out that my friend likes A Fish Named Wanda which has so-called humorous scenes involving killing dogs and pet fish. Well, to each his own. In this film, the stars are weird but not bad people. And it has a happy ending without killing animals or people!"
3,Dumb & Dumber....,They don't make comedies like they used to. Or maybe it's just that I'm a grumpy old man. Well I am a grumpy old man and they don't make comedies like they used to. But just think of all the money that was paid Nicolas Cage & Holly Hunter to be a couple of screwballs in this movie & be happy.
5,DVD format is 1.85 LETTERBOX (non-Anamorphic),"I wish the studios would get it together especially being now 2009, most of the U.S. now own WS TV's. You do lose quality when you have to zoom in to fill the screen. Plus as in my case I have to drop the resolution to 720p before my WS LCD will allow me to do a Zoom. If set to 1080p, Zoom disappears from the ""Picture Options"" menuWhat is really sad is when they release a ""Special Edition"" or ""Director's Cut"", etc. and it is in 4x3 LETTERBOX. A perfect example of this is ""The Abyss (2 Disc Special Edition)"", the THIRD DVD release of this GREAT film (one of my all time favorite's) and it still NOT anamorphic, it's 2.35:1 in a 4x3 LETTERBOX ... #$%^&*!@."
4,"Very Funny, Entertaining Coen Brothers Movie!",I think this movie is one of the best of the Coen Brothers. It is not a masterpiece but a sign of the great movies to come and a work of art in its own right. Holly Hunter is a police officer and Nicholas Cage is a life long criminal who fall in love and settle down together. Their attempt to have a child is thwarted by her infertility and his criminal history. The couple decide to steal a baby from a couple who recently had quintuplets and fellow criminals decide to hold the baby for ransom leading to some crazy situations including the fact that they don't seem to be able to keep track of the baby. Very cute and funny.
5,My all-time favorite comedy!! Totally flawless.,"I dare anyone to tell me a better comedy than RAISING ARIZONA! Great concept, outstanding writing and direction, and superb action, from Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter down to Randall ""Tex"" Cobb. A Coen masterpiece!"
4,Classic cult comedy,"This classic cult comedy is one of the best ever. The Coen Brothers started with this movie as their offbeat comedies, Blood Simple wasn't really a comedy. Nicolas Cage stars as an ex convict who falls in love with a policewoman named Ed, played by Holly Hunter. As they live their ""salad days"" in a trailor in the desert they find that Hunter is barren, his fruit find no place in her loom. So they do the next best thing, steal a baby from the Furniture Kind, Mr. Arizona, who's wife has just had a number amount of babies. With this baby comes along trouble. Very funny movie that also stars John Goodman, Randell T. Cobb, and Frances McDormand."
2,it was all right,"After watching The Big Lebowski and finding it one of the funniest movies ever, this was kind of a let down. John Goodman was great though, and was the high point of the film."
2,I had higher expectations.,A colleage from work said that this was one of the best movies he had seen unfortunately I cannot agree. I was very disappointed in this movie. ...though I am not much into Nicolas Cage either.
5,Color change low wattage,12/13/11 - I love these bulbs! I have 4 of them now. They are great for outside Christmas lights to replace the bulbs in your outdoor lamps with. I have used one for a two Christmas seasons and no issues yet. I decided to by 3 more this year. My kids really like them too. You can leave them on all night for people to see an not worry about burning a ton of electricity since they consume so little.
3,"Nice, but 2/3 dead on arrival.","I ordered 3 bulbs from amazon. Unfortunately 2 of the 3 were dead on arrival. :-)The working one is nice.I prefer this one:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JHZSEG/ref=oss_productpros: stronger light, remote control, 50,000 hrs compared to 20,000 hrscons: pricebest regards,"
1,WARNING.......DON'T BUY,"The first one I bought lasted 3 days and died, Amazon replaced it with no problem only to have the other one last 3 weeks. It is a rip off SAVE YOUR MONEY IT IS USELESS. Now it is too late to get a refund but I must add this is the only item I have bought from Amazon I have had a problem with."
4,Metallic Christmas Tree's New Best Friend,"I purchased this bulb to illuminate my ""vintage"" 1960s era metallic Christmas tree. I placed the bulb in a lamp fixture with a reflector collar and it did a nice job. Its changing red, green, blue, and yellow light was not as bright as our former ""incandescent bulb-shining-through-colored-plastic-disc"" motorized light fixture, but it did the trick. It fits in a regular light socket, has several LEDs encased in a thick, faceted plastic ""bulb"", and is sturdily constructed. A good value for the money."
3,Vocals Good Amidst the Sameness,"Paul Carrack sounds very good on this latest CD, an obvious tribute to what we once fondly termed ""soul"" music. The songs are pleasant and listenable, although they all seem to sound a great deal alike. This is moreso in the arrangements than the actual song structure. However, this ""sameness"" keeps this from becoming a ""classic"" Carrack collection. It's good music to relax by, so if you're a Carrack fun, it's not a bad investment."
3,Lazy Sunday Afternoon Music ...,"The first thing one might notice about Paul Carrack's latest album is that he produced it himself. More often than not, self-produced albums do not represent an artist's best work.Individually, the songs are vintage Carrack; blue-eyed soul with strong melodies and thoughtful lyrics. Collectively, they comprise an album of music for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Missing from this recording is the punchiness of his previous work. There are really no uptempo tracks.WHERE WOULD I BE and SATISFY MY SOUL are the only obvious singles here. THE ONLY ONE is a beautiful heartfelt ballad that Carrack sings quite low in his register with great effect.Athletes do not train without coaches. Singer/songwriters shouldn't record albums without producers. Even the best ever (The Beatles) employed a producer (George Martin). And Carrack would do well with a producer telling him he needs to kick it up a few notches on some of the tracks. Otherwise, it all sounds like Sunday afternoon."
4,"soothing voice, soothing songs, satisfy sooths the soul","carrack concentates on what he does best with this soothing compilation of soul touching ballads. satisfy my soul the probable single tugs at your heartstrings while inspiring healing and an inner sence of a promising tomorrow. one an only concentrates on committment and the complete satisfaction of requited love. reach out to the one you love, cuddle next to the fire, and loose yourselves to this magical voice satisfying your souls."
3,dissapointing !!,sort of album that grows on you ! listened to it once thought it was dissappointing have listened several times and now it has grown on mewhilst no real stand out track paul carrack just does what he does best low key souful and enjoyable listening !
2,Poorly produced,"Very disappointingly, Paul Carrack and his team have failed to deliver a quality product with this album - no offense intended.Getting straight to the point, the arrangements, production and certain aspects of the musicianship (despite the clear vocals) simply don't cut the mustard - it sounds like an amateur production.If you're after more music in the vain and quality of ""Blue Views"" & ""Beautiful World"", and even ""Groove Approved"", then forget it - this album is not in the same class.Best to wait for another album, and hopefully, the return to classic Carrack: smooth, well-produced pop/soul with those unique vocals."
1,Not what it appears to be...,"This book does hold some important information about the process in and out of fasting and the many ways one can choose to fast, however one could find this information and the included juice/soup recipes on the internet. I was expecting a beautiful book and it is not, at all. It is small, the quality of the paperback is terrible, and it dedicates 1/4 of the book to a form you would have to pay more money to utilize (by sending it in, etc.) If you want to learn about fasting, ask your doctor."
1,the worst move ever,"I love bad movies, this is the most unbearable movie ever made. dont ever buy it for a penny"
1,Horrible Movie...could it get more boring?,"The only good thing about this movie was the scenery. The story makes no sense. It jumps all over the place. One of, if not the the worst Hammer Film I have ever seen.It's hard to believe that this is the same company and same directer that filmed the great 'To The Devil a Daughter.'Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,Dissapointing,"A young man and his sister are kept locked away in their rooms by their father, who is a wealthy nobleman. The father says his children have demons of the mind and brings in a doctor to help cure them. At the same time someone is killing young women in the town and the townspeople are trying to figure out who. A strange priest also wanders around babbling about some evil that is present and says he is preparing to stop it. Eventually all of the above come to a head at the same time and place. The first half hour is slick and sometimes eerie due to good photography and strong settings. The film then begins to unravel into a very predictable film that revolves around sexual obsessions more than anything else. The film still looks good, but eventually it cannot help hold up the mess that this film becomes. Robert Hardy (the father) is wasted in this dribble that really started out as something, but falls apart in a hurry."
3,An okay Hammmer film,"The movie was okay but not great, especially if one has seen any of the other Hammer movies. The script is a little jagged in the beginning so the plot is hard to follow but otherwise the acting is great as is the music and the scenery.""Demons of the Mind"" features a good cast but I would have liked a little more energy from them. Not to imply that the acting was bad, in fact it was quite good. It just seemed to lack a little stage presence that slowed the movie down even more. I'm not familiar with any of the actors (except for the doctor) so perhaps it is my own ignorance that led me to think this.Basically it's an okay movie with some scary bits. I like Hammer Horror films (esp. the 1970's ones) and this one was fun. As someone else mentioned the terror in this movie is not a physical being but a mental state and contributes to the unusualness of the movie."
3,"Good compilation, but not great","While Tom Paxton is a talented musician, this selection of songs from his Vanguard albums features some strange choices. Why the compiler included ""Ramblin' Boy"" and ""Lyndon Johnson Told the Nation"" (both good songs, but easily available on other CDs) and left off a great song like ""Bring Back the Chair"" is surprising. There are great songs here, such ""White Bones of Allende"" and ""Anita O.J."", but the collection would have been better served if it hadn't tried to include ""greatest hits"" originally recorded before Paxton came to Vanguard records."
3,Trashy French Pop,Ute Lemper goes pop diva on this album. Nuits Etranges is a classic blend of techno and top 40. Very Eurotrash. But Ute Lemper is always amazing...
5,"Another ""gotta have the right tool for the job"" tool.","There isn't much to say about this tool other than it does exactly what it was designed to do. Buying all of the necessary tools, oil, and seals was still cheaper than paying my local shop to rebuild the forks in my CRF450R. This tool makes pulling the top caps off a breeze. It was a little more expensive than Tusk / RockyMountainATVMC knockoff tool but it was money well spent."
1,not 100% pure hyaluronic acid,"Misleading title and description. The bottle I received reads 100% pure hyaluronic moisturizer on the front label and contains (in that order on the label) purified water, hyaluronic acid, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexyglycerin. The amazon product description gave me the false impression that I was getting 100% pure hyaluronic acid (so that I could dilute it myself). That is not the case."
2,"Good images, terrible editing","Despite some interesting footage here, this film is scattered, poorly edited, and only for East African die-hard fans."
3,"So-So, good for background, not so good on technique","As a Registered Massage Therapist I thought this book would have more technique on how to incorporate Indian Head Massage into my sessions. It gave a fairly good history lesson, but no real useful information on specific strokes. A dissapointment from a book titled ""Teach Yourself..."" I keep it in my studio as reading material for my clients, however I do not refer to it very often. If you want to learn this type of massage, go to a class, do not rely on a book."
3,Good Softballs,"These softballs meet ASA requirements, so that is their strong point.After one season of practice however, the covers of most of the 12 balls I purchased have rips in them. They are all still useable, but I wish the covers were more durable."
2,Not that great,I had heard good things and it looked entertaining but this book was not that great. The jokes came out like they tried too hard. Anne Taintor gets my vote over this book anyday.
2,Storylilne promissing...execution is not that good,"As a fantasy/science fiction fan i try to see all movies made in this genre. Sawthis one a long long time ago and the result review are the same. Good subjectworn down by so so acting...barely any laughs and the musical numbers are waytoo long..(fell asleep twice).But because this is a rare find, im very happy to have a version of it."
4,Pricey but excellent content.,"I picked up a copy at a local book store strictly for the article on networking and found a lot more useful items included. If you're into Macs for using the iLife and similar software, there are a ton of good ""tutorials"" included in each issue. Newstand price was $15.50, so it's more on the order of buying a paperback book instead of a magazine. Content is excellent--I found things in the tutorials that even the local Apple store didn't give in their classes."
5,Now this is a Magazine!!,"Better than a magazine, more like a book, a very complete, wonderfully colorful, perfect size, great quality of paper, Best I've ever see and read. Well worth the money. These are like books practicaly, only more useful. To be used over and over and over. What a pleasure not to see more advertising than articles. I will most certainly subscribe again."
5,A realistic look into the current Siberian prison experience,"I saw this book in the bookstore of the Pompidou (which could be one of the better modern art bookstores in the world). The photos are fantastic, very human and each one tells a story of a life that none of us can imagine. As great as the photographs are, the text at the end of the book enriched the experience far more - it gives you a context for his photography, how contrived the censorship could be (and how funny - the story about the tennis court is hilarious). The bottom line is that you get to see something that nobody else has photographed, in a high quality format, that will educate you and give you something more than the typical horror stories of the former Soviet Gulag system. If you're like me and you love photography that is unique and really MEANS something, buy this book!"
2,Handle with care,I've had a Fluval 305 for five years with zero issues...until a few days ago. During a routine cleaning I took the impeller out and the shaft snapped in half. Be EXTREMELY careful with this thing when replacing! It's very fragile and breaks with the slightest bit of pressure on it.
2,Not very sturdy,"Ensure you are very careful to replace the 'cover' in the exact way you removed it; it's not monkey proof-don't replace the cover upsidedown, the topside looks like it should be the bottomside! Not true. This is the 3rd one I've replaced. I did notice the 3rd one had a little larger diameter than the 2 previous ones. Just be gentle and pay close attention to the details and you will not have any problems."
3,405 not a great design,I don't really like fluval 405's the FX5's are much better. I wouldn't buy any of the smaller fluval canister filters again. The ceramic shaft and the impeller covers break all the time.
4,One of the best of the series,"I own the Trojan ""Rocksteady"" Box Set which I personally consider a bit lackluster. I also have the ""Club Reggae"" Box Set which I give a hearty thumbs up to. But the ""Tighten Up"" Box Set is my favorite so far. You dig Reggae from the late 60's early 70's? ""Tighten Up"" fits the bill nicely. My only wish would be that some more detailed liner notes were included. Plus the original album cover art for the series was incredible but unfortunately not found with this re-issue package. But the most important ingredients are, of course, good music at a reasonable price, and with ""Tighten Up"" you get both."
3,too long to get results,"I should have read the fine print before buying this. The instructions say you must keep the doors and windows of your house shut for a period of one to two weeks for this thing to get accurate results. Give me a break!Consequently, I won't be able to use this product until I go on an extended vacation. Then I have to mail it off to somewhere which isn't fun because there is no self-addressed postage paid envelope and so I'll have to go to the post-office to get it weighed. I've got a busy post office so there is another hour down the drain.Sure, you save a little money on this, but read the fine print and decide if you'd rather just have a pro come and stick a box in your finished basement (that is what I wish I had done)."
5,Mozart miracle!,"This is possibly the most beautiful opera video ever produced. It was not filmed on stage, but on location in Vicenza, Italy, with absolutely stunning setting. It features excellent performances, including Ruggero Raimondi (the perfect Don) and Kiri Te Kanawa (the perfect Donna Elvira). Of the 5 or 6 greatest operas ever written (all Mozart's, in my opinion), some say Don Giovanni stands out as the most perfect achievement. Whatever your opinion may be, by getting this video you will be getting the very finest rendition of this masterwork I have ever seen. It is sung in the original Italian, with English subtitles. Incidentally, one reviewer complained of the poor quality of the sound. This is unfortunately true (shame on Kultur Videos!) but don't let this stop you from purchasing this excellent video - you won't regret it."
3,Brilliant conception - but technology has failed us,"I recall viewing Losey's interpretation of Don Giovanni back in the late '70s at the movies in suburban Adelaide, South Australia. It struck me then that this what opera should be - drama and music without the limitations of stage. This is still a wonderful interpretation of this work but the quality of the sound and vision on my DVD is awful. Is there no way to resurrect the original?"
3,Tin can sound,"Although the colors are a bid faded, this is a beautifully shot movie. The scenery is very pleasing, and the acting is superb. The real downfall of the film is the sound. It's as if they were singing into tin cans to burn the sound onto records. At times, it's almost acceptable, then something happens and it's horrible again. This really is a pity, because with good sound this would truly be an excellent, cinematic opera production."
1,Choose another Don Giovanni,"I have to agree that the sound quality in this DVD is terrible; without reiterating the remarks on the general 'dead' sound, i will add that there is no real sound picture--the sound never seems to be coming from the actors on screen, and this is part of why the production seems lifeless and boring--it's more like a CD with pictures than a movie with properly imaged sound.Also, i'm not sure i agree with such a dreary palette for the visuals.."
2,THE DVD SOUND IS VERY POOR QUALITY,"FOR THE LATE 1970s, the audio quality is surprisingly poor.It can barely be called hifi, the sound seems to be intended fora tv set speaker. The costume are over the top and unmasculine for themen. I think that overall, this is a bomb. I would recommend the followingDVD:Mozart - Don Giovanni / Gilfry, Polgar, Bartoli, Rey, Nikiteanu, Salminen, Widmer, Harnoncourt, Zurich Opera (2001)orwith really great singers but from 1950s (still with good sound in colour):Mozart - Don Giovanni / Furtwangler (1954) with LISA DELLA CASA !!!"
4,Good Intro to Opera,"This DVD is my introduction to opera. I was encouraged to try a Mozart opera first because they are the most accessible. This production was well filmed and acted. As I do not speak Italian, I really needed the English subtitles. The only down side to this production was the quality of the voice recording. It often sounded like they were singing into a box, while the orchestra sounded fine.If you are new to opera, this is a great DVD."
5,Love It !,"I put this on two months ago when I received it, and haven't taken it off since. It still looks brand new and I just know it will last a long time. Great buy and no complaints whatsoever."
5,Fire Engines,"This is one of my son's favorite boooks. He constantly brings it to us to read. The words are simple, yet full of information. And, my daughter loves pointing out things in the illustrations. One they will want to read over and over again."
4,My Review,I think this book was great. One reason I liked it is I could see myself doing some of the things that Mandie was doing.So really I could relate to the book alot.
2,Waste of time and money,"I had high hopes for this book based on its great title, but the contents fall short. This is bascially a book about the author's personal view of love and relationships, and there are some irrelevant poems by ancient Buddhist nuns thrown in here and there (just a handful in the entire book.)The advice the author gives is not always the most enlightening, but fairly common-sense attitudes about how to deal with general relationship issues. That's why I give it two starts instead of just one. I highly suggest you save your money (and the paper used to print this book) and look for love advice elsewhere."
3,Class Required Text,"This was a required text for my Russian Lit and Culture class. It's not bad, but I don't know that I would have purchased or sought it out by myself. I particularly enjoyed Chapter 4 as it addressed the issue of Byzantine Christianity attempting to overtake the role of mother in the home. It would be useful to feminist anthropological studies."
2,The first Bruce Coville we just couldn't finish.... :(,"Sometimes writers will write when they have something important to share, and other times they just need to keep the mill rolling. Unfortunately, this book falls into the second category where a lot of senseless and meaningless drivel interrupted the main storyline so much the reader falls away, closing the book, and wondering what the point is.If you are a Bruce Coville fan, like we are, stay away from this book and look for other works by him. He really is a terrific author... on the times he really needs to share a dream."
1,bad book,"Very bad book- mostly filler with 10 pages of actual head massage moves, one on each page. extremely disappointing. It was not for therapists at all."
5,SHOULD BE CALLED A THRILLER,"I think this is great that Amazon has a reader review process. We count too! I actually bought this book at a book signing in Carlsbad, California on September 20th. I finished it in one day it was that good! I really liked the Mike Redden character. This book really moves out and keeps you turning the page. It is a ""thriller"" in every sense of the word... I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyes being kept on the edge of their ""mental seat"".. It's just a plain good story and one great plot. I hope the author continues with a sequel like he said. I mean, don't you have an ""11"" category? Good stuff..."
4,The best there is.,"I have been looking to replace my old and tired strainers with good quality ones and finally found these. They are solid and professional and unlike ALL the others, the mesh is not bendable. I give it 4 out of 5 starts because they are a little shallow. Also, the sizes are way off. I ordered the 5 inch and from rim to rim it is 4.75 but the actual size of the inside is 3.75. The 6.5 inch strainer is wrong too. That is 6.25 inches and the inside is just over 5 inches. So, order the next size bigger. In spite of this, you won't find better quality."
5,"The rise, fall, and rise again of microcars","Kate Trant and Austin Williams' THE MACRO WORLD OF MICRO CARS surveys the microcar: once a common sight in towns and cities and touted as solutions to the postwar demand for economic cars, and now making a modern comeback. What happened to fuel the early interest in microcars, what led to decades of dis-interest, and why the rise now? THE MACRO WORLD OF MICRO CARS receives in-depth analysis in chapters which cover their manufacture and design. Vintage ads in full color blend with contemporary photos to provide an outstanding survey of the culture, creation and appeal of the micro car."
3,Minimalist coffee table book lacks detail,"This is an attractively designed book, although I can't help thinking its minimalist layout and arty typefaces would look more at home if the subject matter was more modern. I suppose the cars themselves are minimalist, in a way, and definitely `arty'. Even so, the book looks like it would be about cutting-edge Italian kitchenware, not ancient oily cars.To some extent, the book is a triumph of form over function, certainly if you thought its function was to provide information in detail about microcars. No, it doesn't do that.There's barely any text, and most pages have no more than one or two photographs, so it really just gives you a fleeting impression of things.There's a section about people and their microcars, a brief section about the history of the little devices, and an A-Z of the main manufacturers.So, it's nicely produced, would look nice on your Ikea coffee table, but won't tell you all that much about the subject."
4,Hammer with a difference.,I got this as a completist of all Hammer Horror Films. I was not dissapointed. The story is very dated by todays standards and it will lag at times but it is intresting to see how the director and writer got this done. I will not spoil it by telling what it is about or any details....but this was an interesting take on killing and the times back then.The commentary leaves you with the impression that the actress did not like the movie she was in. For that reason I found her commentary interesting if not jaded. She was probably paid to do the commentary and since she is not well known probably needs the work. It still is an interesting commentary.The movie was never released here in the US and I never found it on TV. Anchor Bay no long puts out fresh prints so you may have to look around for a reasonable priced copy.
2,Really weird movie...,"I bought this movie as I really like it as a teenager. It's very dated and VERY strange. My husband was bored right to death watching it, I had to turn it off and watch the rest when he went to bed, and that NEVER happens. I think I bought it for nostalgia's sake, and technology+ has come so far now that so many of my faves from yesteryear are just, well, tired and old. If you like weird movies, you might like this one. That's about all I can say about it."
3,Good cast given little to do.,"This is one of those early 70's thrillers, you always think could've been just a little bit better. The dialogue is dull and repetitive, but there are some good things, too. -A nice eerie and spooky tension, so typical for its day. (Something completely lacking in modern-day thrillers; more interested in entertaining their audience with action as stand-in for atmosphere.) The cast is another plus. Now, a movie featuring Peter Cushing, Ralph Bates and Judy Geeson can't be all that bad. -And it isn't, but one still can't help thinking, that a tiny bit more action would've been welcome in this case. The cast just isn't given much to do, especially the brilliant Bates. -No wonder he wanted out of the genre, making this his last film for ""Hammer"". Cushing has more of a cameo, but Geeson is superb as the wife in danger. All in all, an o.k. try, but..."
2,No Real Fear In the Night,This Film could have been so much more if it had just had more of a script. I watched it a second time to confirm my belief that never in any one scene are all FOUR of the leads together. In fact there never is more than three people in a shot at the same time. However it isn't too bloody and Peter Cushing is quite good in his roll as Headmaster. But neither him or Joan Collins live up to the acting they gave us in Tales from the Crypt.
1,Philips flat HDTV 42PF9630A 42'' plasma with Pixel Plus 2 HD and Ambilight,"This is a lousy product. Cost me a bomb, and lasted 2.5 years. The screen has developed a set of horizontal lines making it almost impossible to view."
2,Great picture while it lasts.....,"I am now on my second TV and the picture is starting to degrade. Hopefully the store extended warrenty works well. I bought the TV in August 2005. The first TV had a sound problems, I lived with it for several months waiting for a software fix. Phillips replaced it after the repair shop had it for 3 months claiming it was a sound board problem. It turns out the second TV had the same problems and phillips finally fixed it with a software patch. The second TV now has issues with ocassionally rebooting, image ghosting, and flashing when showing a white background. I never have liked the ambilight. When we purchased this TV it had the best picture and features available for the price. Phillips service has been poor(lack of any help, and very slow to supply parts), but I have gotten service with out much difficulty, if you can wait for it."
1,The worst service ever experianced,I purchased this set from BJ's and it was dead out of the box. The service dept is totaly worthless. No way to expedite a repair even for a brand new product! could take 5-7 days for parts. Can't bring it back because the box gets destroyed by there directions to get the set out.I will NEVER buy another Philips ANYTHING ever again.
1,One word JUNK!,"""I have had this since 2/06, after approximately 4 months the tv stopped working. Service was called and it took 1 month to order the part. Three weeks later the same part failed and service was called again. They were told this part was on back order with no estimated time for it to come in.I contacted Philips and was told they can do nothing for me. I then asked for a phone number for customer service and the lady REFUSED to provide me with it. One would have to ask themselves why they would purchase a product from a company like this!"""
1,My beautiful TV turned into a piece of junk....wait before you write a positive review,"Just a word of warning before you buy this TV. For the first few months the TV was fantastic - then one day it just turned itself off - never to come back to life. That was in November of 2005 and over 3 months and 2 housecalls later the set is still broken and Phillips continues to do everything they can except replace it. Currently, according to Phillips, the parts are all on back order (for over a month now) and nothing has happened. Not only will I never buy a Phillips ANYTHING again - I will certainly make sure my coworkers and friends don't either."
2,Good TV but NO ports for computers,The usual performance as a TV but doesn't have a vga port for pc input so you can't use this as a monitor without a converter. Buy the LCD version instead.
1,there isnt one good thing i can say about this product.,"its going to be returned tomorrow. the sound quality was unbearable. the picture was horrible. the remote was unintelligible. the ""manual"" was worthless. why did i ever buy this piece of junk? i want a sony!!!! if i could have i would have rated this product a ZERO"
5,Charming travel journal about wine,"Length:: 0:27 MinsThis is essentially a travel journal, and it's a very good one.We join Ralph Steadman on his journey around the world to different countries, looking for wine. He walks on the dirt track leading to vineyards, watches grape being crushed and savors them in a glass. The writeup is excellent and detailed, looking into the life of people in the business of making wine.The wonderful illustrations are a bonus, and complementary. It makes the reading so much more enjoyable.Highly recommended to people who likes reading travel journals or loves wine.(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)"
5,Trampling Out the Vintage,"Ralph Steadman is a very wicked person. Has no respectfor nothing, this guy. Anybody who could do drawingsfor Hunter Thompson couldn't possibly get seriousenough to do justice to wine, could he?The Grapes of Ralph is a semi-serious, very funnylook at the world of wine by a guy with a truly enviabletalent for illustration. His drawings range from wistfulto wildly exaggerated. The text, which is sometimes asfunny as the drawings contains a good bit of informationalong with the humor. I bought two copies, one forthe bookshelf and one to cut up and frame in thewinecellar.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe novel bang BANG. ISBN 9781601640005"
5,Don't fear the p-value!,"This really is a fun book - yes FUN - I'd even say it's a bathroom book about statistics. It's very conceptual, not at all driven by formulas - and makes many statistical concepts crystal clear. A great book to pick up for the PHD or the stats phobic - -"
5,Excellent resource for the statistically challenged!,"If you are an analytically impaired and statistically challenged math phobe who needs to understand and use statistical methods, this is an excellent resource. The authors explanations are relevant and easy to understand. Highly recommended for those who need to get a grip on the numbers in research!"
3,Not a bad book...,"I must begin by stating that I didn't receive the book until the week of my exam. :( So, obviously I was not reliant on it. The book is small enough to be ""not so"" intimidating. It has relevant formulas and explanations to give one the gist of stats needed to pass a biostats class.My opinion of the book may have been better had the product arrived sooner."
5,A masterpiece that chalenges human nature.,"First off, this film was brilliant IN EVERY RESPECT. The animation was not drab, but slightly depressing(very appropriate for this film) and was not big eyed, spiky hair stlye anime, which would have destroyed the film. The characters are not super heros or ninjas who can take off your head with a sneeze, but real people with real emotions. From the very begining you could relate and/or feel for the character as the story builds. This film truly does ask the qeustion ""can a man overcome his pain, and be a human."" 5 star film, absolutly!"
5,Not a lighthearted story...,"The ending is very, very heavy. I will remember this feature long after the others have vanished from my memories."
2,Big. Fat. Yawn.,"What a paralysingly dull, underwhelming, tedious and long-winded film. The animation is above par, to be sure, but the plot is nonsensical and the characters almost repugnantly lackwitted and completely uninteresting. Avoid, or forever lament those many missing minutes of your life."
3,So-So,This movie feels like just another tear-jerking American film. And it's from Japan. I really wanted to like it more than I did. The way it was narrorated was cool though (the story of little red riding hood).
5,Dark and Compelling- Not Your Typical Anime,"If you have any interest in politics this movie is for you. Even though the movie takes place in a fictional Japan where the Nazis won WWII, it is very rooted in the real world. The movie has a real, live action feel, and the tone is dark and somber, yet the animation is jaw-dropping. It is very fluid and realistic. Some have said the plot is too slow and the movie is lacking in the action department, but these are just people with no attention span. The characters are real and complex, they are fleshed out beautifully and we really care what happens to them. The story is complex and disturbing, abounding with insane, unpredictable plot-twists. All in all, this is a cinematic treasure that should have found a wider audience."
1,I liked the movie,"But I never really got it through amazon. Not really sure how why either.Besides that whole unfortunate side, the movie itself is enjoyable. It shows a different side of the ""brute soldier"" that I really didn't expect. Overall, I thought it was worth purchasing, like 3 months ago..."
3,DVD Review,"I bought this DVD knowing it was an old title. However, I am a fan of GIS and so I figured Jin-Roh would be as graphically enticing. For the most part it was. However, I was completely dissappointed by the video to digital transfer. Being a Bandai DVD I would have hoped for a little bit better quality. For the most part Anime distribution in Japan is monopolistic to Bandai Visual / Emotion. So when I pleasingly saw the Bandai/Emotion symbol on the cover, I figured the quality of the DVD to be similar to other region 2 dvds they carry. It was just a video transfer. The only other DVD I have purchased that is similar in quality would be the Macross Plus Movie Edition. Although Jin-Roh does have dual language tracks and subtitle options, I was still hoping it to be more like GIS. But either way, being an anime fan, I will proudly add this movie feature to my collection."
3,Not as good as the hype.,When I bought this I was expecting it to be outstanding but when I finally watched it I was kinda let down. I was expecting some unbelievable storyline and great animation however the animation was only so-so and the story was old and boring. It was entertaining but just not what it seemed it was gonna be. I liked Metropolis much better.
2,Haaaatteedddd itt.....,"I was really hyped about this anime.. being as all the good reviews I saw and all. I could barely make it through this movie it was so boring. Im into more of the action oriented anime like Ninja Scroll and Vampire Hunter D. This movie is full of story, however the story is pretty lame and never really ends up making much sense. All it seems to do is try to compare the common society to a old fairy tale about Little Red Riding Hood. I would definitely rent this one first guys, I give it 2 stars because the animation itself is definitely beautiful."
2,I apologize right off the bat...,"... to those of you who enjoyed it, but this one put me right to sleep."
2,Jin-boring,"This film was disappointing, overrated and terrible! I liked the look of the federal police costume and the animation was about 7.5 out of 10. But be warned, the action is 1 out of 10! I could not believe how boring this movie was! I was expecting a cool action film concept; this was way off the mark. The dialog was so boring and monotone I fought very hard to stay awake! I felt like someone was telling me a lullaby. The DVD artwork for the movie showcases the cool police armor but the armor could have been left out of the movie and it wouldn't have changed the movie at all? It was only in the movie for about 15 minutes and was very poorly developed in my opinion. It was like some gimic the artists used to trap people into watching the movie?"
3,Looks great but...,"I like this film but not overwhelmingly. The animation is top-notch in a realistic style. Unfortunately the story revolves around a special-forces policeman who shows less emotion than a rock. His dead-pan look and slow walk is a complete contrast to the stage where he makes a stealthy entrance into a museum, turning into a metal-gear-solid sort of commando. Yes, he (Fuse) is the living personification of a terminator, especially when he dons his armor and heavy gun. Hmm, maybe Arnold the terminator showed more emotion... The action parts of the film are cool but the middle of the film is dull and the little red riding hood references are overblown. If you like depressing films then this is right up your alley, otherwise beware."
1,Not So Quick Anime Fans: Read This Before Buying,"I am a HUGE FAN of animation, especially ""The Ghost in the Shell"" & ""AKIRA"", and subsequently bought this film based on faith alone because it is from the creators, so please don't make the same mistake. I recommend renting this video first and then deciding if you want to buy it (you might find yourself trying to stay awake). I would recommend ""Vampire Hunter D: Blood Lust"" instead, especially if you are a fan of quality animation with exciting storylines..."
1,Cure to Insomnia,This is the most boring anime i have ever seen. I bought this looking for some good action ( based on the cover and back of the dvd) but i was very disappointed. Its just a whole lotta politcal jibber jabber. Stay away from this unless you like boring stuff!
1,Don't stay up to watch this or you'll fall asleep,"My brothers and I are all real anime fans and we've watched Ghost in the Shell, Akira and all the other greats. My brother thought this would have to be good because Okiura had written Ghost in the Shell and Akira but this was terrible.First, this movie is 2 1/2 hours long and it had no early action and an annoying repetiveness that made both my brothers fall asleep within the first twenty minutes. My cousin gave up watching after about five minutes, citing there was no action and the plot was boring.I have a lot of patience but even I gave up after a while. Jin-Roh was absolutely disapointing. Think about renting it first, cause I ceretainly didn't think it was worth buying."
4,the special edition kind of missed it up,"After wittness a suicide bombing of a terrorist girl, Constable Kazuki Fuse becomes haunted by her image, and is forced to undergo retrained for his position in the Capital Police's Special Unit. However, unknown to him, he becomes a key player as a dispute between Capital of Local Police forces."
2,BORING,"This movie is extremely boring, 2 stars because the animation is good. If you are looking for action or something intense this is not it."
1,Woeful attempt at a semi-serious anime,"Once again we have a special police unit with the usual monosyllabic member questioning his loyalty etc and a wilful young girl who waxes philosophical in a most patronising manner (at least it would be if any of the cast had an ounce of intellect). Yes these characters are the tired staples of Japanese anime convention that I personally have seen enough of (this is to say nothing of the supporting cast). The entire film revolves around a ponderous analogue to the story of little red riding hood: offering nothing more than a superficial gloss on a tired and witheringly mundane story. The animation is excellent and I get the feeling this would have made a far more effective short. It may not sound like it but I do consider myself a fan of anime, however this film shows very little of what the genre has to offer."
5,excellent,"I was looking for Jin Roh specifically, since it was marked on a list as being created by the same people as Akira and Ghost in the Shell. This is a good starting point for describing the movie, but doesn't even get close to how wonderful, bizarre and stunning Jin Roh is. I bought it used and it came in great condition, and mere minutes later had put it on and was taken away into a alternative future, dreamlike and visionary but also deeply rooted in the past, on a beautifully wrought retelling of Little Red Riding Hood."
5,One of the greatest,"It opens with a slow start but will deliver in the end. Make sure you watch it more then once. there are plenty of things you miss the first time around, trust me."
4,Very different than usual.,"This movie was very good. It's about a different Tokyo. The situations between the many levels of the Police System are very difficult to understand. Basically There's this special unit that does all the dirty work and they don't get any appreciation. After an incident the Police Brass want to get rid of this special unit by developing a conspiracy.In my opinion, this movie was written very well. I thought it needed some more emotion and dialog. The characters have these ""unemotional"" eyes. It's not what I'm used to. If they eyes were less ""cold"", then I would've rated it much better. Overall it's a good movie."
3,Not as good as I expected.,"The movie was interesting and had some original ideas. However, I did not think the movie is worthy of a higher review than three stars. It is not in the same level as Akira. The animation was better than average, except for the gun scenes which are first class. Not enough action for my taste."
2,Agonizingly Slow and Convoluted Plot,"I finally managed to sit through this anime after the 3rd attempt and still found myself fast-forwarding sections of the movie. I truly wanted to like this movie once I heard that it was written by the director of Ghost In The Shell, one of my favorite animes.The opening sequences of Jin-Roh kept me interested in how Fuse, the protagonist, might come to terms with his involvement in the death of a young girl. But the as the plot starts unfolding, it just ends up being a convoluted mess. I couldn't empathize with any of the main characters, who were either frustratingly non-communicative or just spoke in metaphors to explain themselves.Kudos for art direction and excellent voice acting, but story is dissapointingly weak which ruined it for me."
1,DUD,"with as much hype going for this film, I was excited...andAkira is one of my ALL time favorite movies, I have to say though, the animation is Top Notch in this film!!!! I wish ALL animated films maintained this high of quality!!as for the storyline...well, its Way to long and drawn out, and the only action seen here is the first 15 minutes,and the last 20 minutes, I found this film VERY boring, even nodded off a few times, its these types of films that ruin someones first impression of an adult animated film,it just seemed to drag,and go on Forever!!!! and then Finally a tad of action...the film is not an Action film.....but if in the mood for a nihilistic drama, by all means waste your money here......"
1,oh man,I brough this movie because it sounded good but it wasn't. I didn't like the art work. The plan was ok but the movie just wouldn't keep my attention.
4,Great Anime aimed at Adults,"This is actually a very easy anime to recommend since it is easy to describe: it is plainly story-driven, dark in both theme and imagery, and with limited (yet still bloody, and even disturbing) violence. It defines feature-length story-driven anime aimed at adults looking for dialogue and intrigue, not action.This does not mean overlap is nonexistant, just that other favorites such as Ninja Scroll are action-oriented videogame movies for adults, and Jin-Roh is akin to slow, sophisticated movie.Each has its place in my collection, but know what you are getting if you are interested only in a specific subgenre of anime. Jin-Roh is thus definitely not for those who >>only<< want uber-colorful panty-fests and robot smasheroos...Extras: all very nice, with great interviews (which jack up the film length rating, the movie is really 1:40--which reveals some reviewers didn't really watch the movie), and nice soundtrack."
5,nice anime in line with Akira,"This was a great anime, I loved the animation and the graphics stunned me. The story was great I can say how the basis was on red riding hood was a great story plot. There is a lot of violence but it shows the full potential of this anime."
2,"this is very cute, but beware of a bear @ your reception!","I bought this book for my 4 y/o cousin who will be my ring bearer. We thought he was so unique in thinking he would actually be wearing a bear costume down the aisle, but I guess he wasn't the only little boy thinking literally!! The book is very cute, and tells your little man how to behave for the ceremony, but beware, toward the end of the book it says that he can do whatever he wants at the reception, even to the point of ""growling"" at other guests. I'm considering removing that page since we have such a literal little guy on our hands! Other than that, I think this will be an adorable gift!"
2,"Cover, ill- fitting",I am disappointed with the fit of this cover. Perhaps if the bed was not fully inflated it would fit better; mine does not stay secured at the corners and is not properly wide and long enough for top/side coverage. It would be better if it were generally a little larger.
1,A bogus version of a fascinating film.,"I was Al Whitlock's cameraman at Univrsal Studios for many years. I participated in making this film, I appear in it and I narrated it.This hacked up version of the film is incomplete, misleading and suffers from poor video quality. For whatever reason, the true credits have been stripped off, and names were added who had nothing to do with the film.Dr. Jankowski, one of the added names, knows nothing about this film and does not know why his name is on it.The film was actually made by Walton Dornisch and Mark Horowitz who deserve every credit for creating it. The film deserves better and buyers deserve better.Bill Taylor ASCMember, American Society of CinematographersGovernor, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and SciencesFounding Member, Visual Effects SocietyI list my affiliations for identification purposes only."
4,"Well, nobody's ""complete""","I reviewed a college calculus text here on Amazon in which I state that the book would probably be ok if it had any explanation to accompany the author's examples. I used this book (the idiot's guide) to provide some of those explanations.I found the author's tendency to ""go for the laugh"" wearing a bit thin after a while. But, for the price, you'd be hard pressed to find a better introduction to calculus."
2,made me feel like an idiot,"I read reviews of this book and of C. for Dummies before deciding on this book. Partly because this book has problems (and solutions).I am coming back to math after leaving it in high school, Algebra 2 (only partially digested at that) and I found this book barely helpful. The chattiness of the author was irritating and the lack of clear definitions- along with the sort of voila! magician formulas, also unexplained- drove me away.Am now reading Calculus Made Easy, and so far find it a much better tutor. Highly recommended."
4,A good refreshment book.,"To refresh Calculus for a short period time, i.e. 2 or 3 weeks around 10 to 15 hours week, it's very informative and concise guide.The ""You've got problems""'s drill question has detail answer with each step on most cases so that reader can check one's understading of each section."
5,Thoughts from a HS Calculus instructor,"I purchased this book as a supplement to my current text. As many of you know, Calculus text books are not the most reader friendly. This book takes a subject that can be intimidating to many, and clearly explains the topics in a humorous and informative way. Thanks Mike! Keep writing."
5,"Very Good, it made calculus/math fun!",This book was amazing! I knew that when I did not understand a topic that was discussed in class I could flip trhough this book and in about 5 minutes the topic was 100% clear to me! It was great. This book was also great for looking up and studying my weak topics before the AP test. All in all a great book!
2,A book of little use,"I bought this book expecting that it would ""clarify"" some of my concepts. I was scared because the Calculus class was notoriously hard and the teacher expected students to be somewhat mature. I was dissappointed with this book because it lacks sufficient details, and it skips over many important concepts. Moreover, this book does not have exercises, and so is of no use to the types who firmly believe in ""practice is perfect."" I was grateful only once when this book helped me understand a very basic concept: taking the derivative of negative degrees. This book is not helpful at all for learning integration if you are bound to do lots of homework problems. You might wanna rethink if your class is elementary, but if you happen to be in the toughest High School in the city, then take my advice: Stay Away From this book; it is truly for idiots!"
3,Leaves out important details - Leave it on the shelf,"Kelley cracks a good joke. I can't deny that.But he can't teach you calculus, or make you understand the most difficult concepts. In fact, he won't even teach you how to do the problems very well, as for every type of problem there is, he only presents _one_ problem for practice. A great deal of the theorems in the book go without explanation. He explains the _usefulness_ of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, for instance, but he doesn't even attempt to make its meaning clear.This book will not teach you much about calculus and I have found it to be a waste of time.If you're looking for a more rigorous yet understandable guide, try Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson."
4,My dog likes it,"At first, as it has a strong smell , my puppy didnt want to eat it, but after a while she likes it"
3,My dog loves them....But,"My dog will basically eat almost anything- rocks, dirt, tree bark, plactic...You get the idea. Im not sure the fact that she likes them means a whole lot. I switched to them because I read that pork skin is more digestible than rawhide...With all of the rocks, tree bark, plastic, etc she is eating I thought a more digestible snack was a good plan. Its a bit freaky that the package admonishes the human to WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY after touching them...Ummmm...should my dog be eating something that I shouldn't have on my hands??!! Makes you wonder..."
3,Not for a budget traveler,"While this book gives a wonderfully worded look at each section of greater London, it is definitely not for a traveler on a budget. It tends to focus on expensive touristy attractions and shopping areas while glossing over cultural areas where you can really get a feel for what London and its inhabitants are all about. Whether or not this book will be useful to you all depends on what you want to know about London.If you are happy spending a lot of money to see the changing of the guard, Big Ben and Harrod's with every other American tourist in London, then this is the guide book for you. If, however, you want to get off the beaten path to meet the locals and get a real feel for London, you may be better suited by another travel guide such as Rick Steves' ""London Through the Back Door""."
3,Direct fit?,"Bought this to replace the OEM, rattling converter in my 1994, 4.3, 2WD S10 Blazer. It did fit well but you will have to buy new bolts to mount it. The OEM heat shield cannot be used since there is no way to bolt it to the new converter. The converter has a heat shield built on it so I am hoping not having the OEM shield won't be a problem. You also have to pull the cross member that holds the transmission up to get access to the converter but that does not present a big problem. As suspected, I had to cut the old converter where it clamped at the front, again no big deal. All in all, it was about a 2 hour job using common hand tools and you can't beat the price compared to most auto parts stores and beat cobbling a ""universal"" converter on."
3,not satisfied,I recieve my order today and the box was all torn and some of the content was missing from the box. I would like to be contacted about this issue and hopefully this can be replace
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"When I ordered this CD I was expecting the original ""The Girl from Ipanema."" Imagine my disappointment when a totally different version, minus the incredible sax, began playing. I wanted to toss it then and there. I decided to check out the rest of the CD but it didn't get any better. Fortunately, I found the correct recording on the ""Getz/Gilberto"" CD, which is absolutely an incredible listening experience. This is the CD you want if you're looking for ""The Girl from Ipanema."" Don't waste your money (or your ears) on this CD. Just awful."
3,The Girl from Ipanema,Very seldom do I buy a CD for only one song but this time I did and I am pleased. I am a hard core lover of original versions but this is one of the very few times I prefer the reissue; of course I am refering to the title cut. We get conditioned to what we like (Pavlov and the dog); I was strolling through a book store one day and I heard The Girl from Ipanema playing and was entranced even though I knew it wasn't the original version I remember from the 60s. So Pavlov rang the bell this time and I just had to get this song. The title cut and the cover by themselves are worth three stars.Henry Hank
2,wait for the cliff notes version,"I picked up this book because I was interested in the trials and tribulations of product development. It turns out that half the book is about Solly Angel's life, which I had no interest in spending time with. Regarding the product development portion of the book....I am astounded that anybody with a degree in architecture design would make the lame brain mistakes that Angel makes from the get-go. I only read half the book, but my advice to those whose interest is in product design is to flip through and read a bunch of pages to get a feel for it before buying it."
5,Great Book for Any RPG!,"I've been reading through my copy of Dreadmire and have to say this is one of the most interesting reads I've had in a long time. The book is very complete, and is full of fun material. It's also filled with good artwork. This is one of those RPG books that every time you open it, you find something new. It's a great addition to any RPG and a very fun and entertaining read. Quality printing and binding too!"
4,Yuban coffee,"Very good coffee. Can't always find it in our local stores, so I order it thru Amazon every 3 months"
3,"Yuban ""easy grip handle"" can","I have bought Yuban coffee for years -- good stuff. But the new packaging with the ""easy grip handle"" really is bad. The handle is just fine for picking up and holding the can, but once you have opened the can, measured out the coffee, and then snapped the top back onto the can to keep the coffee fresh, there is a serious problem for us senior citizens. It is very, very difficult to pry the top back off of the container after it has once been opened and then snapped shut. I don't know who designed it, but if he(or she) had arthritic fingers, or wasn't too strong, he (or she) would realize this container isn't for him (or her), or for his elderly parents or friends. It's a bummer.An A for the coffee, an F for the can. Buy the traditional can if you can still find it in the stores."
5,best coffee at best price,"Yuban is one of the best coffees available, but not sold in all areas. Amazon's case price is unbeatable!! I get a case every 8 weeks, always on time!!"
3,Consistently Delicious,"Have you ever had a great-cup-of-joe from a freshly opened can of gourmet coffee, only to wonder what happened to that 'fresh' taste as you dig deeper into the can? I have experienced this with other main stream brands but not with 'Yuban Original' coffee! The last pot of coffee has always tasted as good as the first one. There is also a unique quality to this coffee that I have a fondness for. Of course, there will always be something 'better' out there, but it's usually at a higher price. Though the coffee is consistent, it is the wide price range ($0.18 - $0.40 / oz) of this coffee that keeps me at bay with a more cautious 3 stars.NOTE:With the ""Subscribe & Save"" option, you can trim costs and be assured of free shipping. Previously, I had subscribed to the 33 oz cans - right up until the option was discontinued by Amazon. I have since switched my subscription to this size and updated this review accordingly."
5,You can't beat Yuban,Yuban has been my coffee of choice for 20 years. The price at Amazon is very good. I recommend this product for any coffee lover.
1,Cost is way too hight,I've read the reviews and I agree that Yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at $100 for 12 cans comes to over $8 a can. That's $3 more a can than I pay at my local store. I don't understand the high price?
5,Absolutely the best,"This is the coffee we crave in our house. It is a strong brew, yet not bitter. Yuban is the best ground coffee we have tasted, yet."
4,Is it still a bargain?,"A 25% price increase since the end of November, from $37.28 to $46.65. Is it still a bargain?Now we've passed the $50 mark, which comes out to $5.57 per pound. I pay $5-6 per pound for fresh-roasted beans in five-pound lots.If the rating were just for the price, I would make it three stars."
2,Bad Quality,"I had thought it would be comprable to an estwing, but the quality is not good. It nicks at the slightest tap on a stone. I would not recomend this chinese knockoff."
1,Great Looking Hammer - Poor Design,"Have had this hammer for about three or four weeks. Great hammer, nice looking, however after a couple of trips I noticed that the black 'button' near the end of the handle was protuding slightly. On a trip this week, the 'button' which turned out to be a plastic rod which goes through the handle, and which secures the handle onto the shaft fell out and disappeared when I was breaking some rocks.I now have a hammer that tries to come apart when I hit a rock - horrible design! I guess I now have to find a steel rod to replace the plastic one - something Valley should have done in their original design!I think I'll stick with Estwing for my next hammer purchase!"
3,Apocalyptic Storyline!,"While this film has some great scenes and good special effects, the film-makers have certainly taken alot of liberties while adapting the story from the bible!There is no rapture, there is no mark, and don't get me started on the battle of Armaggedon. The movie also has a prevailing Amercan theme- I'm in no way anti-American, but the story almost strugles to include Americans- his brother just turns out to be the Vice-President! It also gives the impression that America is totally against Antichrist, but when the real thing occurs, every country will surrender to the charismatic leader pretty quickly, I'd say. I was really pleased with the visuals and acting, though, and the film clearly shows good triumphing over evil. But I recommend Left Behind instead of this.And in answer to the other reviewer, no Satan cannot 'give us' our souls, but he can trick us by lying- he is of course, the father of lies."
4,Good revalation movie,"Ready for the revalation, the end time? This movie will at least make you think. The Omega Code really isn't the theme of this movie. It may not have even been mentioned. Instead get ready for an entertaining interpretation of the future. Slow at first, it's fast paced at the end."
4,Meggido,"Good piece of video that deals with the rise of the anti-christ. How could anyone believe that such a thing could happen? Interestingly enough the film touches on the signs that will forshadow that time, wars and rumours of wars, Israel becoming a focus of world attention, a single economy being established around the world (the euro?), earthquakes, hunger, changes in the environment.....mmmm, sounds like the time might be right to watch the film and think about the issue.Michael York is good as the antichrist, the special effects make this an entertaining production, but the message is worth pondering after it's all finished....."
5,Megiddo rocks! much better than the omega code,"I've already seen this movie, thousand times cause I got it on VHS. I wrote to TBN saying how much I like it so much, and so they send me a copy of the movie without pay. Through & through still the one of the best christian movies, and for once shows the battle of armaggeddon and christ return-NAZARENE, YOU ARE LORD! awesome Michael york deserves an oscar for his role as stone Alexander. The love theme in the musci between david and gabriella is beautiful yet sad. They both did good too. I also love the african scene."
1,This movie should be called the Life of Satan,"This is THE worst movie I have ever watched. I got an e-mail from the producer saying I should get all my friends to come and watch the movie with me to promote more great movies like this. Well, sorry charlie. I felt so bad that my wife was with me. We were both disgusted by how Evil it was. Sorry Michael Biehn, I liked your acting. Next time give credit where credit is due. Please enjoy other movies and don't waste your time with this one. ..."
4,"Kind of a limp story, but has semi-cool FX and okay acting!","The only true good thing about this movie is the special effects. The story line is kind of limp, but the effects were cool! The acting was kinda fake! But, hey if you liked the first movie, then go ahead see this movie, but don't say I didn't warn you, you might end up not liking it."
2,anticlimactic amongst other things,"I agree with the other reviewers that gave it bad ratings (on the first page at least). It portray Christianity as cartoonish. This is a definite b movie that is only made worse by the religous connotation. It's one thing to make a b movie; it's another to make a b religious movie. Not a good idea.Poor acting. Mediocre effects. I'm reminded of The Last Star Fighter except that was good... cause it was from the 80's and you were expected to have crappy effects.As always, these ""End of the World"" movies are anticlimactic. Big battle, bright light, badguys: ""Oh, it's Jesus; let's give up."" Sorry, but I'll be kinda disappointed if that's truly how it is. Are we to believe that a creature as old as Satan is so stupid? Why bother?Zzzz..."
2,The Book of Gobbledygook,"One would expect the producers of ""The Omega Code"" to go from bad to worse. The special effects are better, the acting is improved, and the production values are obviously improved.Why only 2 stars? Simply put: what in the world is the movie about? If the producers feel that they are being faithful to Scripture, then they need help, badly. This movie's plotline wanders pretty far afield from anything I have ever read in the Bible, no matter how many drinks I have had beforehand. On the other hand, it suspiciously resembles any number of Tom Clancy (who, as far as I know, is in neither the Old or New Testaments) thrillers.Not as agonizingly awful as its predecessor, this movie nonetheless is in dire need of improvement."
4,pretty cool,this was a really cool movie though it left out mny important key signs that are in the bible the beast is supposed to suffer a mortal head wound then come back to life and the origens of the beast were way off base and the three opposing kingdom join the one world thing and then betray the beast only to be killed before the midway point and where on earth was the rapture of the Church and the signing of the seven year treaty two important signs of the times and they also left out the mark of the beliver and the mark of the beast! other than these and other errors it was a great movie if you want to see or read a drama about the end of times read or watch Left Behind.
3,Better than the first,"The problem with movies about the book of Revelation, is that they cannot put in 1 1/2 to 2 hours of everything the end times is about. I liked this one better, mainly due to the Battle of Armageddon being played out. Lots of pretty good special effects.But it could have been much better, if there was more money funded into it. Unfortunately, you will not find this in Hollywood. Things left out that should have been discussed, were the Rapture of the church, more of God's judgements, and the Mark of the Beast. It also would have been great to actually have seen Jesus coming from the heavens on his white horse, followed by the angels and raptured saints. Also, there was a little cursing in it, which surprised me, for a Christian movie."
3,What the heck is up with this movie? Prequel or sequel?,"This was strange! The first Omega Code showed the prophecy of Revelations and ended with the end. The second one ended with paradise. Both showed the end of the world! After the first one, it should be over. There is another one! It shows Stone's (Anti-Christ's) childhood, and ends with the end but shows Stone in the first one! It has a lot of action, but is kind of wierd. Maybe you can figure it out!"
1,"Too much Satan, too little Christ","This movie spends far too much time dwelling on Satan and sets up an incredibly lame confrontation with the United States. There is also a weak effort at romantic interest. I loved Omega Code but this sequel is dreadful, without doubt the worst apocalptic movie I have ever seen."
1,NOT Biblically based,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone! This movie claims to be based on the biblical writings of the end times. Makes me wonder if the writers and the producers have actually ever read the Bible. Never even mentions the name Jesus. Please, if you know the Truth, or have any desire to, DO NOT watch this video, or it's predecessor, The Omega Code."
1,Logan Should Have Run...,"...from this movie after reading the unconvincing script. Michael York must have been desperate to lend his name to the marquee, which his performance as a surprisingly hammy Antichrist could not come close to saving. Highly derivative, this effort makes use of every cliche in the book. The ending is sheer horror camp. Don't expect ""The Omen""...or even ""Thief in the Night""...."
2,Not what I expected,"Many of the FX in the movie were done really well! I was however disappointed in the story itself. The lack of creativity as well as research, made a good vs. evil theme looked more played out than it really is. I went to go see this film because it was suppose to inspire Christians. As a Christian to me it had no spiritual worth so it was just another movie. I have not read `Megiddo' the novel. So I can't say if the movie is comparable to the book. But I have read `Revelation', and this apocalyptic movie about the end time events, is a very poor depiction of it. If you want to see some in your face special effects, then go see this movie. A word of caution, focuses on satanic rituals at first and has its share of violence. I really don't recommend it for small children."
4,A SMALL GLIMPSE OF WHAT THE END OF THE BEGINNING WILL BE,"No Human being can ever really comprehend what that last great battle will be like, but watching this movie, and the end, (which I did 6 times) will have you praising God and saying""Even so, Come now Lord Jesus""!!!A wonderful movie for those who await Christ's return, and are inspired and filled with hope in the watching of this movie..Not perfect, but the best I've seen in this avenue so far!"
2,Megiddo,"After purchasing this movie I wish that I would have just rented it. The storyline was good but there was so much stuff out of context of the Bible. There were many things missing from the film that happen during the rise and rule of the antichrist. There was no rapture of the believers, the two witnesses of God were missing, all of the plagues, and so on and so on. It states in Revelation not to add or subtract anything from this book or else. Well, I think the people who made this film are definitely in the or else catagory. I am a Christian and I would never use this dvd as a witnessing tool. I would be afraid of leading them in the wrong direction. To me it is just another film of fiction and fantasy because there's not much biblical content for this movie stand on."
4,I enjoyed it,"Although the politics almost put me to sleep at the beginning scenes, it had a good message. (not to mention the fact I had to drive an hour and a half to the nearest theater that wasplaying it...)Anyway, well I don't agree totally with their interpretation on Revelations, I thought the ending was really uplifting.I know some groups may get ""offended"" by it, by I liked this movie.All Christians and curious people should see this movie."
1,BLECCCCHHHH!,"Was this a Christian Movie? What I saw was Satan entering a small boy, who then lights fire to his baby brother. In another portion of the film, the boy puts on a black robe, and smears an upside-down cross on his forehead with blood. Demons are flooding a chapel where he is. It's a very disturbing movie which is depicting Satan having a power which he doesn't have. It's rated PG-13, it should be R. On top of all that, the closing Bible verse is quoted incorrectly! It says that Revelation 15:17 concerns God living on Earth and having harmony, when in fact, the verse has nothing to do with that. After watching the movie, I hadn't felt like I had watched something that God would approve of. It reminded me of a morbid horror film, and I strongly advise against it. The opening logo for the film company had an 8-ball, that should have given me a clue. The 8-ball is a symbol for fortune telling and drugs, not for Christians."
5,Better Than I Remembered It,Well written considering it had to cover the whole Tribulation time period. Others have already described the movie plot lines so I will not repeat it here only to say that it is the best Tribulation movie out there. The Left Behind movies is better but Megiddo was able to smartly put together the whole Tribulation into one movie and not felt that it was all crammed together or rushed.
5,Megiddo - Omega Code 2,"Awesome Movie, One of my favorites! This movie is very well made and I could watch it over and over again!"
4,A good movie.,"This film is done nicely with much action and a good insite into what is to come in the end times. Michael York does a great job at playing a lying, coniving, and decetful Anti-Christ. Michael Biehn does a good job at playing the loyal follower of truth.Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Deuteronomy 31:6 KJV"
5,Good movie,I was so happy that I found this movie new. When it came out I missed it and found it on TBN's web site and was able to watch it on there. I really like the point of view on the movie. I found it to be easy to follow. I thought it had a good plot and some great action too. I think this is a must have movie. So sad the quit making it.
1,One of the worst,"Simply one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it is bad. And you have to see the comments by the 'biblical scholars', one in an extremely loud shirt with a heavy Texas drawl. Must be on Dubya's advisory counsel on religious affairs."
3,Better Than the First!!!!!,"I seen this movie, last year in theaters.It's pretty good!It was better than I thought it would be!Well,I didn't agree with a couple of things,but it's still fairly good.It was a lot better than the first!On this one, it's sort of a prequeal and a squeal.Anyway, it has pretty good special effects!Exspecially the supernatural scenes!The war scenes is average,after seeing ""Saving Private Ryan"",It's Okay.Michael York is good in here!He's a very good actor!Anyway, try this movie out.Rent it first, just in case you don't like it.There's one thing for certain, you'll like it better than part one!"
2,Disappointing!,"I watched this movie expecting a great sequel to Omega Code and walked away completely disappointed. Megiddo not only does not have a real plot, but was not at all inspiring to me as a Christian."
1,Just as believable as any other christian fairy tale,"More offal from the TBN money machine that operates on the guilt and fear of the unintelligent.D-list actors, horrid script, clunky direction, cable-access quality cinematography - all I can say for it was the crappy special effects were kind of fun if you like that sort of thing."
4,Lunch Box Letters,"What a lovely idea for a book! At first glance, it's a sweet idea, offering tear-out pages with riddles and jokes, etc. for parents to use for writing sweet notes to their children. Closer inspection reveals a depth of feeling by the authors as each tells a personal story about the letters each has written to his/her child. I got misty-eyed as I read their stories, and immediately tore out one of the fun pages and wrote a note to my own little one!My daughter especially loves getting emails from whichever parent isn't with her at the time. I'm going to share this book with her dad, who sometimes finds it hard to put his feelings into words."
5,Very fun book!,I just received this book and I am so excited to start using it tomorrow. The 75 tear-out notes are very cute and there are great ideas for writing your own notes. Excellent purchase!
1,"It's funny how the author uses the word ""funny""","This book has lovely pictures but the author is, perhaps, not well-versed in the English language. Repeatedly, and seemingly at random, the author uses the phrase ""It's funny where Ben's train takes him."" Here I have to strongly disagree. It is not at all funny where Ben's train takes him (to small towns, through tunnels, to the city, etc.). It is perhaps fun, maybe exciting or interesting, but no, it's not funny.This book is completely appropriate for those who don't feel compelled to read all of the text to their children. If, however, you are the type of parent who wishes to stay true to the original text, be forewarned-- your children will never score highly on standardized tests of verbal ability. Perhaps they will be forced into a life of manual labor, or maybe even have to tour the country performing as a side act to Lollapalooza in which they eat coal for spare change."
1,Smells like death! Didn't help with refux.,"After having our six week old adopted son placed with us we immediately noticed a foul odor from him and connected the odor with the formula that came with him. Every time we had a feeding or a bowel movement the whole house was gagging. Not only that but my baby had very runny stools. He had infant reflux. I took him off this and put him in the ""Gentle"" formula Walmart brand and liquid Zantac. He did SO much better. Honest, I can't see how something that smells so bad and chemically could be good for anything. Not to mention the high cost of this stuff! Yuck."
2,40 miles wide and 2 inches deep,"I have read this book and I have to disagree with the previous reviews. I think that the author has very broad experience with Terminal Services and he demonstrates that very well. But, this book does not have any practical configuration depth.This book provides a very good overview of the technology, history, and the many features of terminal services. What this book lacks is the important details and steps needed to actually configure Terminal Services. This book has about 5% substance and 95% fluff. If you need step by step instructions for configuring Terminal Services, then this book is not it."
5,A Reality Check for Distance Learning,"If ""the devil is in the details"" of online learning, Paloff and Pratt have done an excellent job exploring the promise and pitfalls of distance learning programs. Anyone in the process of designing online courses or programs in higher education should read both this book and their earlier book before they launch a new course or program. Personally, this book helped me avoid several mistakes I otherwise would have made in my first distance learning adventure.The book looks at both teacher and administrator perpsectives, and understands that both insitutional support and instructor skill are key elements for success. While the authors are genuine advocates for the medium, they understand that interactivity does not equal mouse clicks, and that building learning communities takes skill, practice, and structures. The book is full of very helpful examples, learning constructs, and realistic assessments of distance learning successes and failures."
5,Seattle Reviewer is Exposed as a Phony!!!,"As a former gunnery sergeant with 1st Force Recon Company, in Vietnam from 1969-1970, I can assure any of Norton's readers that what he wrote about in Force Recon Diary, 1970, was totally accurate and factual. I was there with him. I also know the former Marine who lives in Seattle, and that pathetic individual, afraid to state his name in his April review, is both a coward and a phony who is known to many of us within the Marine recon community. Tossed out of the company for cowardice under fire, he resides as a Marine malcontent in the Seattle area. I hope Norton's books will only continue to enlighten his reader's and that they will learn from our experiences. Credit to Norton and shame on the former Seattle Marine who comments from ambush. It figures."
3,"Right story, wrong period of time.","As a Special Forces cadre,I observed the Marine Recon teams working the Laotian border around our base at Lang Vei. Their 4 man teams provided much needed information for everyone. We knew of massive enemy build ups in the area prior to Tet, thanks to these brave men. There is no mention of those days in any of these books. Sadly, the story of Marine Recon's greatest feats will probably never be told."
1,Wish I read these two reviews!,"I ordered this watch without reading the reviews. Upon arrival, I had the same experience as the others! Cute watch does not work and the instructions don't pertain to this watch. When I complained to my husband, he found the reviews and I'm kicking myself for not reading them before ordering. I now live in Beijing where knock-off Disney watches can be had for a couple of bucks. I try to do the right thing by finding the genuine article at a good price on Amazon and now I get to pay for shipping the return back to the US! At least the counterfeit watch would have ran for 6 months!"
1,Do not buy!,I bought this watch for a christmas gift but when it arrived it didn't work. The instructions were no help as there appeared to be no information even relating to this particular watch. I'm guessing the battery is dead. I am returning this watch for a refund. I wish I'd seen the other review on this watch before I purchased - I probably would not have ordered it in the first place if I'd read the other review. Shame because it's a cute watch.
1,Watch Stinks!,"I bought one of these for my daughter's birthday. After it finally arrived, it didn't work. The instructions that came with it were useless, and for the most part, inapplicable to the watch. It didn't even say anything about replacing the battery (assuming that was the problem). I emailed Amazon and they promptly sent another one. Same problem. DOA. Now I have to send this one back too, and my daughter still hasn't gotten her gift. Don't buy the watch."
1,What butter?,"My order was not shipped due to the heat of the summer. I ordered thinking they would pack it with dry ice or some other method of keeping it from melting. I suppose the Amish people don't have access to dry ice. Anyway, I will reorder when the temps drop to a level of normalcy again."
3,Thing before you buy this product,"Pros : Excellent picture quality, excellent contrast, great sound and weighs 8kgs less than sony 30 inches widescreen HDTV. Very easy to install and plenty of ports both on the sides and the back for your dvd/vcr/cable box etc. connections.Cons : In the widescreen mode, small amount of picture cuts from both the left and right sides. I verified this by freezing a frame on my dvd and switching between widescreen and 4:3 mode. While in the 4:3 mode, the black bars on the sides are not perfectly straight. In the 4:3 mode if you switch on the tv captions, the tv automatically switches to widescreen mode which is really annoying. This problem does not happen with DVDs in 4:3 mode.My conclusion is that this tv is much cheaper than other entry level HDTVs so if you can live with the negative points I listted above then it is a great tv."
3,Poor Ending!,"What started out to be a very exciting read, ended very quickly leaving you expecting more. Too much of the novel focused on one particular item, which made this book slow and harder to get into than her others."
5,The Scarpetta Series,"I am a new reader of the Patricia Cornwell 'Scarpetta' series. A fellow sitting next to me on a flight across country was reading one of the books in the series and tore the page from his book that listed all the 'Scarpetta' novels. I was just finishing all the books of another crime writer and was anxious to get started. My seat mate suggested I read them in order.Thanks to Amazon, I have been able to get almost all of the series at a great price and am enjoying the read.'Scarpetta' is an interesting chacter to get to know - I am looking forward to getting deeper into the series. They are very good reads. The early books were written in the early 90's - I am looking forward to getting deeper into the 'Scarpetta' world and definately can't wait to read these into the 21st Century.Body Of EvidenceVery interesting, exciting read!"
5,Scarpetta novels are a great read.,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and I like the Scarpetta stories the best. I always learn something."
3,Not what I expected,"I love murder mysteries, especially the Kathy Reichs ""Bones"" series. Since I've read all of the ""Bones"" books, I was hoping the Kay Scarpetta books by Patricia Cornwall would be similar. I was disappointed that the book is not as exciting as I had hoped. I will probably continue the series just because it's the medical/murder/mystery novels that I enjoy, but definitely not the quality of Kathy Reichs."
4,A Good Read,"I'm a huge fan of Eve Dallas and Temperance Brennan, so I thought I'd try Kay Scarpetta. These stories are not as technical as the Temperance Brennan novels and have a very interesting plot line. There are just enough loose ends to make you grab the next book. Glad I got into this series late. I don't have to wait for the next installment."
4,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Reading the series.What impressed me: Body of Evidence was definitely a topsy-turvy mystery. Not only do you not know what's going on with the victims, you really don't have nay clue who to trust in the investigation either. Kay's not knowing friend from foe in her personal life adds a lot of tension and intrigue to the story. And either Cornwell does much better in this second book with laying off the excessive explanations, or I'm just getting used to her writing style.What disappointed me: Nothing stood out as disappointing. Well, except the crazed homophobia of law enforcement. Was it really that extreme in the early 90s when this book first came out?Recommended: Yes. Even better than the last.Continue series: Yes. I'm definitely becoming interested in Kay's personal life."
4,Another good installment in the Scarpetta series,"Loving this one. Has a lot more twists and turns theprevious book. Did not see the end coming, great book"
5,Excellent Book,I really enjoyed Body of Evidence. I just discovered Patricia Cornwell and I've been reading all of her books. I love the interplay between characters and the relationships that she builds. My only problem has been that I've been reading them out of sequence. I found Body of Evidence well-written and engaging.
4,Great Book!,"After reading the first book in Patricia Cornwell's series Postmortem, I knew that I was going to want to read the next book. I really enjoyed the first book and knew that this one would be even better. This book kept me so interested and I never wanted to put it down. In each chapter something else exciting happened that made me want to keep reading. I really loved this book and I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in forensic science and who loves a great mystery."
4,Nice to remember why I became a Cornwell fan,"The last few Patricia Cornwell books have left me unsatisfied. They weren't awful but they just didn't resonate with me. So, I pulled Body of Evidence, the second in the Kay Scarpetta series, off the shelf. I was reminded why I became a Cornwell fan. The plot is interesting with some great twists and turns. The characters are growing more complex. Mostly it's a tidy book with a clear beginning and ending. So many of the most recent Scarpetta's seems to leave things unresolved.This isn't an awesome book but a good solid read, particularly for readers who are new to the genre and would be more comforable with a known author."
5,Scarpetta Series Grabbed Me,"I usually read series and I fell upon this one. I like the character of the book. She could be a bit more ""warm and fuzzy"", but that's okay. I like the other characters in the book. This book let me get to know them, and I genuinely want to know what happens to them. What more can you ask for in a book."
4,good book,"it is a good book, maybe not the best one but I enjoyed it. It was my first Scarpetta novel and I will continue the saga."
3,Not Her Best Scarpetta,Kay's concerns are growing old and i grew tired of how many times she smoked or wanted to smoke her cigarette(s). Cornwell made it a focal point of a scene and its activities.
5,A +,"Another terrific Cornwell novel. Holds your attention throughout the book. Even my ""non-reader"" husband loved it!"
2,Had to give it two because the average was just too high,"Cornwell's writing is formula writing; the only creativity in this book comes through in an occasionally flowing bit of prose. For the most part, though, the characters have very few dimensions and the plot seems contrived. It certainly keeps you guessing, but only because the finale is so goofy. We know from the beggining what's going to happen between the good doctor and the killer; we just wonder who the killer is (and if we can trudge through the entire book to find out.) Definitely a brain candy kind of book, but not even especially good brain candy at that."
2,I just lost interested halfway thru the book,"I know everyone has different interest or opinion. I respect that. Nothing wrong with that. I do love mystery and suspense. I have several favorite well-known authors. For some reason I read this author's books (first two books of the series) and I just lost interest halfway thru the second book and didn't bother finish it. Because I felt that the author was overdoing the character descriptions (unnecessarily wordy with characters as one of other readers had typed on the post) among other things instead of making the story itself or plot more interesting. Who knows the books at later series are much better, I wouldn't know."
2,Not her best,"When I look back over the long history of Kay Scarpetta stories, I am sorry to say that the writing has fallen off considerably. While reading Cornwell's latest, I kept thinking, this is terrible, I can't wait to finish it.But I am faithful to Scarpetta, her neice and all the gang, and so I will keep buying and reading the books"
3,"Nice reading, not so nice story","This is an easy book to read, I can't tell you that is a page turner or an exciting thriller, but it keeps you reading and interested in the story.The story of the killer is more or less good, but the reason of Sparacino to chase Kay is not so good because you really doesn't know anything about Sparacino.Now, the biggest mistake, Mark, if he is an agent, he can't tell anybody what he is, including his lover, I am wrong?"
3,Too Exciting to Put Down!,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's novels and I wait with anticipation for her new release each year. Her books are full of every emotion that a person can feel. Fear, hate, compassion, sorrow, love. It is an emotional rollercoaster with each turn of the page. I have NEVER read an author's work as I have done Patricia Cornwell. I tell everyone to pick up one of her books, and you will read it from cover to cover in one sitting. She is the best!"
4,Ms Cornwell is a good writer and obviously knows her heroine well,"though I was a little put off by all the loose ends being quickly tied up as Ms Cornwell raced to the obligatory neat ending. Also, I think the story would have been better served had the killer emanated from the complex past relationships of the protagonists. The forensic-pathologist thriller has been done to death (pun intended), probably even before Quincy, M.E. was on TV, but I found that the author of this first book I have read in her series does still manage to mine new territory."
3,A slow to unravel novel,I did not care very much for this book. For me it seemed to drag on and on and on before coming to a complete climax in the last few pages of the book. I usually love a mystery but this one did not fall into that category. Sorry. Katy
2,Never captured my interest,"When I had read over half of the book and I still was not interested nor felt strongly about any of the characters, I decided to call it quits. This was my first time to read Patricia Cornwell and I definitely prefer others like Sue Grafton, Janet Evanovich, John Grisham, etc."
3,"Nicely written, pointless story","I read this book on a plane flight from India to the US. The story moves forward briskly and held my interest, so I'd definitely recommend the book to anyone who likes mysteries, the supernatural, or ""India-ana"" (I'm less sure that science fiction fans would like it). At the same time, the subplots get very tangled, and some sections have no clear point (the ""ghost train"" chapter is truly creepy but doesn't have any connection to the storyline). Even worse, no character except Murugan is well-developed, and the story seemed more and more implausible (almost ludicrous) as it unfolded -- leaving me disinclined to read the book a second time. Maybe I like things too neat and tidy, but I think Ghosh needed to flesh out the details of the conspiracy and do a much better job of developing the idea of soul transmigration via malarial infection."
2,"Cool Ideas, Bad Novel","The Calcutta Chromosome suggests an intriguing conspiracy theory regarding the origins of our understanding of malaria. I was so intrigued by the novel's central theme that I investigated the history of malaria and day-dreamed about the unlikely possibility of a personality-imbued chromosome.Unfortunately by the end of the book, I was so irritated by the disjointed plot, the flat character development, the numerous plot tangents that lead NOWHERE, and the sadly flat, bored ending, that I threw the book out in a fury. Fortunately I dug it out and sold it an unsuspecting used book store clerk."
3,Fantasy + Mystery + Religious Sects + Science Fiction,"While reading: don't expect an answer.Enjoy the levels of the script while they merge.The Nobel Laureate Ronald Ross, unknowinglyguided by a mysterios group (probably a religioussect).An isolated inventory help assistant, somefriends, a supercomputer (which rescramblesthe electrical fingerprints of email messagessent years ago out of the earthbound stratosphere) and a Freak-Expert on the Historyof Malaria.And of course the biological vector: theMalaria Parasite.All embedded in a tale of mystery where thestarting point is 20th century New York withflashbacks to the 19th century India."
1,My opinion,Mildly interesting science-fictional ideas in the service of an uninteresting novelist.Cardboard characters who do nothing but tell each other very long stories.Over-clever and disorienting plot structure.I couldn't get into this book and I don't understand the good reviews it received.
4,Intriguing ...,"This clearly has to be one of the most off-beat books I've read till date. It is an intriguing concoction of science fiction, mysticism, malaria, enchanting Calcutta, quest for immortality and the divine. There are many entwined stories and some of them are set in different time periods (influencing each other) that make for some very interesting albeit difficult reading.Like most fellow readers, I was confounded by the end and think it is very sudden and open ended (as if leaving the door open for a sequel). However, the difficulty and (occasional) frustration in understanding the intriguing story is richly rewarded by the stunning chapter on Phulboni's stay at the abandoned station in Renupur. It'll evoke vivid colorful mental imagery and send chills down your back, blurring the distinction between the real and the surreal."
1,lost leads,"A book of total lost leads, great starts to intrigue, interesting ideas and insights, teasing insinuations, and no meat to be found. A very disappointing book."
3,Couldn't understand!,"Very weird. I couldn't understand the story. Not sure whether it is a sci-fi, or an occult, or a paranormal novel. Plus, the ending just did not make any sense. There are already many reviews saying pretty much the same things, so I will not repeat them. The only reason I am rating it at 3 stars is because despite all its failings, the last 100 pages or so were very gripping and kept me turning the page (though the ending, as mentioned, didn't make any sense)!"
2,Disappointing,"After such classics as ""In an Antique Land"" and ""The Shadowlines,"" Ghosh's latest book is rather a let down, much like ""Circle of Reason."" In ""The Calcutta Chromosome,"" the characters are not well developed at all, and they all seems so contradictory, especially Dr. Murugan, who carries much of the burden of this book. Part science, part science fiction, part mystery, the story becomes less compelling when doused heavily with the technobabble of science and computers (the latter is very unrealistic, even for a futuristic fantasy.) Simply put, it detracts from a potentially interesting story. Even the concept of the Chromosome and it's omnipotent possiblities is not developed enough to make the title a compelling one."
2,Disappointing,"I had great expectations from Ghosh when I started reading thisnovel, but in the end, it turned out to a disappointing read. Ghosh tries to brign together the mysticism of India, and the Sci-fi world of Arthur C Clarke, and in the end seems to fall short of capturing either of the two worlds, and brings them together in an incongrous way.Some points in the novel were interesting enough to make me turn the pages faster, but at most points, I just wanted to finish the book so that I could go on to a next, more interesting read."
2,Predictable and Amateurish,"I really wanted to like this book. I bought it on the way back from a trip to India and I like science fiction. I'm not sure if predictable is the right word for this book, but everything one of the main characters theorizes about the mystery is true. You're never left wondering if some of the information is false. In most thrillers, things are slowly revealed to the main character through twists and turns and false leads. Not here - the main character somehow postulates the exact theory behind all the mystery and reveals it all to us. And he's never wrong. He is really a plot device to tell us the backgound and solve the mystery. It's not very fun to have the story spoon fed to you. This book seems like it was a first novel written by someone just graduated from college.I give the book 2 stars (instead of one) because I still had a hard time putting the book down at the end even if I didn't like it. I'd rather have spent the time on another book though."
4,entertaining and thoughtfull,"I found this book full of interesting ideas. I've found myself comming back to ideas from it over and over again, even now some months after I read it. My only complaint would be that i wish it had gone into some things deeper. It was entertaining, really a fun read."
3,"Interesting, but took a while to get going","I found this book quite interesting coming on to the end, however in the beginning there were several separate threads that didn't seem to be coming together in any way.The Author does manage to pull them together at the end (just in time!)and I was left asking the question ""What happened next?"" some people dislike open endings but I think it was an appropriate way to end this one."
2,"Intriguing, ultimately disappointing","Ghosh's novel of a conspiracy/mystery surrounding malaria, mosquitoes, and spirit transfer is a quirky, different sort of book.But even in an offbeat novel, you need some questions answered, As one of the reviews below states, you feel like the story stops 25 pages before it should.Worth a look for some intriguing ideas, but not executed as well as it could be."
4,"Wonderful discriptions but hard to digest , scientifically","I like to think of this book as a literary masterpiece rather than a science fiction book. Ghosh, with amazing lucidity creates true to life pictures of New York and British India. The sequence of the ghost train is superb. It is some time since I read the book but I still can remember things from this book as pictures. Ghosh has this amazing ability to paint pictures for you with words.One amazing fact is indeed Ronald Ross (the discoverer of Malaria parasite) had something to do with a guy named Lutchman (lakshman? Laxman?). I followed a link from the nobel laureates site (www.nobel.se) to info about ross and indeed there is the mention of Lutchman!But otherwise some of the theories put forward in the book are sort of undigestible for the scientifically literate. Still this is fiction and counting other pluses of this book I give it four stars!!"
3,what was that?,"The style of writing and the format were impressive. Murugan's character was well etched out and the author style of writing comes across in Murugans lines. The chapter on Phulboni's trip to Renpur was engrossing and eerie. However,the ultimate meaning of the book was incomprehensible and too open ended. It's worth a second read."
3,Too opaque for my tastes,"This appears to be a book you either love or hate. It has all the ingredients of a fine novel and a fun read--intriguing plot, exotic (to the Western eye) locales, some history, some mysticism, a little bit of science blended with some speculation--and a juicy conspiracy to tie it all together. Ghosh is a good writer, there's no doubt about that.Nonetheless, I found this book difficult to like. It had its moments--the ghost train scene among them--but overall the plot was too opaque for me to follow consistently. The twists and turns were fun at the beginning, but by the second half of the book I was totally lost. This book has gotten great reviews, but I just didn't enjoy it."
3,Yr basic double helix....,"I really wanted to like this book in which the writer bounces cleverly between different points in time and locations. There are nifty medical/genetic notions, and the descriptions of India were intriguing. It's written in a more literate style than I usually encounter in a sci-fi novel.As I read on, however, I began to feel dragged under by too clever twists, and the strands of the plot eventually became hopelessly entangled in this confused reader's head. By the end, I wanted to grab the author and ask him ""what was THAT about?""Maybe if I reread it again slowly and patiently, a notepad at the ready, I would figure it all out. But then again, maybe there has been too much chromosone damage already.Also, the book ends just like this."
2,A Bit Disappointing...,"Chromosome is a fairly intriguing story revolving around the history of malaria research with a little bit of soul transmigration (of a sort) thrown in for good measure. It has a very complex narrative that draws you in, but in totality it wasn't as well executed as I'd have liked. The author's tendency to abruptly switch back and forth between flashbacks was a little confusing and the ending felt incomplete and left me more than a little disappointed."
5,"A wonderful book, for Dads too!","I'm a Dad, not really a full-on Zen guy, but I do have a healthy appreciation for Zen.I can honestly say that whether or not you're into Zen, or are a Mom or a Dad, this book is wonderful. The writing is superb, lyrical and flows like a fresh spring stream, bubbling, laughing, and crying all the way. If you are a parent you'll like it even more; this is not a preachy book, or some strange mystical women's book. This is a great book about life and love and it's a special treat to read. Even for a Guy."
5,"help for every mother, zen, christian, or other!","With three kids under 5 I was struggling with a whole host of emotions and new depths of sleep deprivation. A desperate search on Amazon revealed scores of books for parents on how to manage the kids; almost nothing on how to manage yourself. Then I found Momma Zen. It is broken up into short sections to address all different kinds of issues: your anger, your guilt, your fears about being a good enough parent, your miserable sleeplessness. Each section can work like a daily meditation, and there's a ""concordance"" of sorts in the back that helps you go directly to the section you need. I've given this to three other moms, who all thought it was a lifesaver, just like I do! Buy it! SOOOO helpful."
5,Best parenting book I've found,"Insightful, non-judgmental, and a joy to read. I'll keep this one on my nightstand for a long time to come."
5,Nice book,"I gave this 5 stars because it is written by a ""real"" person not claiming to be more enlightened than anybody else. You can sense the genuineness of the author's intent in this book. It's an easy read."
5,Excellent MP3 Player! Highly recommended,"I purchased this player a couple of weeks ago and Love it! The sound is Awesome, it comes with a car kit that works great, its backlit, has a Great Equalizer, an overall excellent player. The software is a snap to use, (I had 18 songs transferred in no time, its that easy)"
4,RCA Lyra,I really love it! The ability to use your cigarette lighter socket and tape player is really cool. MP3 players have come a long way. They rock!
1,"Crap, utter and total crap","This is a piece of junk, the screen went out shortly after is was bought. Avoid at all costs."
4,One Little Problem,"Here's my only problem with the Lyra and the reason for the missing star; the buttons are not only on a hair-trigger setting (no click), they protrude from the front. If you put it in your pocket, attach it to your pocket or to your belt, you will inevitably inadvertantly brush across the front and turn it off or skip a track. I don't know if the jogging case solves this, but it doesn't look like it from the picture. It's irritating. Other than that, I think it's an excellent machine."
2,Not that good.,"Okay I bought this on a whim. It's been okay for that last few months. The version of the Real Juke Box it came with is buggy as ... and crashes often, mostly when moving files to the lyra. It's started skipping and popping on MP3's that otherwise work fine. Some tracks have pieces of other tracks mixed in OR parts of the song play backward. The CF card is fine. I'd recommend something else, like the NOMAD or RIO. I feel like I flushed my money down the toilet. RCA also has some of the worst support on their website. They should stick to making TV's. It's obvious they just wanted to crank out a product."
2,not for doctors,"This book is not for doctors or medical students.It's for patient information (""Home Diagnosis Guide"")."
2,Go the Distance,"Not as ""Bluesy"" as I expected. I became interested in Walter Trout and his blues style from a Video recorded , I believe at the Chicago Blues Festival by Walter Trout and The Radicals,Show #13 and tried to order from a telephone number listed (800-851=7722) but the phone is never answered. If this CD/Video is available from Amazon I would buy it Immediately."
3,"Huge fan, but not of this cd","I'm a huge fan of Walter Trout but have to say that I'm not particularly crazy about this cd... I've listened to it several times but just don't think this is his best work. In fact, I'd have to rate it lower to the bottom. Sorry! I'd love to say great things about the cd, but I can't."
5,Awesome CD,"This is a great CD, but do not buy it off of here, its expensive. Go to www.loonatix.net it is their record label, you can get both of their cd's for $10 each."
4,A bit on the curious side,"My grandson cannot do this toy on his own yet (1 year old), but will lean in closer when the music is coming to the end-and then snap back when George pops up. Nice interactive toy to do with him."
1,"Love Curious George, but...","I would love to know what the profit margin on this toy is. The price is astronomical for a toy that is not particularly well made. Ours didn't fall apart as quickly as the other reviewer's, but don't expect this toy to last long. Kids are inevitably going to play with the door latch; a responsible manufacturer would take that fact into account and make it as sturdy as possible. If it were on sale for $5 to $7, you could probably buy the thing without feeling ripped off. The current price (over $25) is absurd. That said, for as long as the toy lasted, my daughter loved it. Appropriate for age 18 months, give or take a few either way--based on our experience, at least."
1,Broke after 2nd day,"Jack in the box broke within 2 days of light use by 2 yr old. Amazon was great, returned shipping prepaid and money credited to charge card."
3,"child loves it, we're on our 3rd one","I purchased this toy for a kid who loves jack in the boxes & curious george. He LOVES it. The toy is cute, but it hasn't held up so well....we are on our third one in less than a year. Still, he loves it, and it's not too expensive, so I replaced it....twice. :) I don't know if other jack in the box toys would be more durable, or if it's the nature of the toy that makes it easily worn out & broken."
3,Pop goes the weasle,My 3 y/o enjoys it. I had to send the first one back because it popped incorrectly. I would prefer a weasle.
3,Curious George George-in-a-Box,"All was good with this product with one exception. The latch on the George-in-a-Box did not latch up firmly, and I suspect with time it will not latch at all."
4,Very good Toy,"I bought the Curious George Jack in the Box for my grandsons, ages 3 and 1.5. Both enjoy it and the older boy can work it just fine. So far it appears to be of good quality and workmanship."
4,Classic Loved Toy,My young grandson loves to turn the crank and sing along with the song. I guess that is the educational value of this toy -- learning to turn the crank. It arrived in reasonable condition and on time as expected from the seller. My single worry is the durability of the toy. It did not seem as substantially built as the versions were when I was a child.
4,LOTS OF FUN,MY ONE YEAR OLD LOVES THIS TOY HE HAS SO MUCH FUN WITH IT AND HE IS ALWAYS SURPRISED TO SEE GEORGE JUMP OUT OF THE BOX!!!AND ITS SO CUTE
5,Get One,Great for developing motor skills and memory. It has been a good prouduct and still looks new.
1,Will,"There are at least two Curious George ""Jack in the Box's"" The Original or first run model is at best acceptable - the one with George wearing a green shirt is the model that is ""Cheapened"" price is the same - but the quality is not. The original one has stamped molded tin - the cheap model is just flat with a silk screen finish. The original model uses fake fur - the cheap model uses green fabric ( They saved 2 cents in the material cost) If your looking to get this item for your kid - save them the disappointment of it breaking - or if it does don't blame the kids. I think that their are other Curious George toys or novelty items like the lunchbox that offer a better value.PS - OK I took out the Jack in The Box hamburger joke - geeze!"
3,Just o.k.,"I knew that the product was used, but I didn't expect it to be missing some of the press out pieces. Since it's a book where the reader gets to choose a word to complete the story, this is important. It is disappointing for a child and the parent helping them create the story."
5,All the Herbs that Fit,"According to the blurb on the back cover, herbs add dazzle to any dish and for the most part I've got to say that's true. In this book you'll find an introductory chapter on herbs, then you'll find the chapters broken down by herbs in alphabetical order from anise hyssop to thyme. Each chapter has a few recipes from world renowned chefs featuring a dish or appetizer with the chapter's herb.Though one particular herb is missing, you know the one, the one you can put in brownies, other than that, you'll find quite a range here. I really like Emeril Lagasse's Fall River Clam Chowder in the thyme chapter and Jamie Shannon's Shrimp Creole with Rice Seasoned with Bay in the bay chapter. In fact I've served these two recipes together on several occasions with great success. This is just a delightful cookbook that I just love and I think you might too."
4,An intriguing western score for Nyman,"I haven't had the opportunity to listen to the cd as a whole yet, but I have seen the film. The film is flawed, but one of the standout elements is Michael Nyman's haunting score. The end theme in particular is an amazing track that combines just the right amount of the customary inspiration from Morricone's Once Upon a Time in The West, while marking its own territory with a composition that lays open the frosty Western plain depicted in the film better than the cinematography does. This film has flown below the radar, but fans of classical western scores should make a point to listen to this work."
5,Magnificent .,"Michael Nyman is without peer as a composer of lush, symphonic and evocative film scores. He adds enormous value to any movie project that he is associated with. It is astonishing that he has not achieved wider recognition. This is one of his best ever - moving and uplifting even with no knowledge of the film. Having seen Michael Winterbottom's latest Thomas Hardy derived epic, Nyman hits exactly the right tone to capture the tragedy of Dillon, the character at the center of the story. The film will likely miss wide distribution, but those who see it in a cinema, and those who will subsequently see it on video or TV will want this superb piece of music."
1,this made me say uhhhgg,"This is the most non-funny movie i ever saw, Master P is trying to do 10 things at once, i mean, he is good, but he over does it with too many projects. music, movies, being in the NBA, & on, & on. most of the movie is Eddie Griffin doing stand-up comedy, and most of it is not funny. and thats the whole point of the movie. for Master P, i will admit that the ""I GOT THE HOOK UP - THE COMEDY JAM"" is very funny! watch that instead."
2,Ok movie not to great,this movie was more like a porno flick than a movie. If you like eddie griffen or master p or nudity than this is the movie for you. i suggest belly or somthing else but not this.this movie isnt really approprate for kids eather. every other word is the f word so rent this movie before you buy it
1,Not that good!,The movie was alright when dice was in it. But he was there only for about 10 minutes anyway. After that I started to fall asleep because the story became boring.
3,Eddie Griffin ROXXX,"This movie is funny as hellif you have an OUNCE of a sence of humor, u HAVE to see this moviehowever, in storywise... it's not too great, but its still worth seeingwhether its a rent or a purchase, you MUST see this movie(prefferably rent)"
2,It was ok for a rental,"The movie started out with a good story line and the stand up was pretty funny, but what happened to the rest of the story."
1,urban collectors,"Urban Collectors advertised something they didn't have. When I asked for a substitution, they hemmed and hawed about the price I paid. I said when a realtor has an item on the shelf with a price, they come through with the very article or a sub for the same marked price. I got a ""I have to talk tg management and will get back later to you"" then ""Our phones are out"" the ""We lost your order..start again!"""
2,"Good try No Limit,","Foolish is a decent flick from No Limit Films. Eddie Griffin does what he can with the script, but it almost takes away from his acting chops. This film should have just been a stand up comedy film, because that's all it really is"
1,Incomplete and not very useful,"This Fodor's guide is a great dissapointment. As a resident of Mexico, I found the book to be of no use whatsover. The maps are generally poor, the accomodations listed are just the basic tourist traps you can easily find out about anywhere, and outside the major tourist cities there is NO information on many parts of the country. Overall, a poor excuse of a travel guide."
1,Where the Toys Come From,"I would have given this zero stars if that were an option. I have all of the Disney's movies, and had never heard of this one, so I had to have it. This is the first of anything from Disney that I think is absolutely boring! DON'T waste your money! The picture on the cover is very deceptive - don't expect this movie to be anything like the Toy Story movies! This is not animated at all! It's like a documentary on how toys are made, with two little cheap wind-up toys as the 'stars'. When the 'stars' talk, there is no movement, just dubbed in voices - and they're not even cute voices!"
2,The case of Professor Crews,"Any reader of this interesting volume should also read Crews' early works in literary criticism. It is a highly educating experience to learn the development--or should I say the radical change-- of his opinions over the years. Anyone versed in the history of psychoanalysis should also discern a pattern not altogether differerent from Jung and others. As a polemical writer and literary critic Crews is substantially talented; as a thinker, alas, he is recycled Popper with a vicious bite, though I'm not sure he understands Popper, who supposedly converted him to a Freud basher. Crews is all too ready to attack Freud whenever he can,with his considerable rhetorical resources,and to this worthy cause he will devote the rest of his life, I'm sure. So we should not be surprised when, decades later, the world finds it a life spent in vain."
1,this book is profoundly intellectually dishonest.,"What is most disturbing about Crews is his intellectual dishonesty in setting up ""straw men"", especially early ideas of Freud's that Freud himself later modified -- as Crews well knows. (However, it is possible that Crews is less dishonest than I believe, and merely ignorant.)"
1,Too small,The dimensions of 14L x 8.8W given for this product are completely untrue. This product measures 11L X 8W. I bought it for a Townie Electra Bike Seat which is 10L x 10W. It did not fit. I does fit my husband's bike seat which measures 10L x 6W. Otherwise I would be sending it back.
4,Gel Cover Works on a Narrower Seat,"We had purchased replacement (wider, better padding) seats for our bicycles. It was my fault for not measuring the seat dimensions before ordering. The gel cover did not fit on the wider seat. Our solution: we re-installed the original bicycle seats and then used the gel cover.We're in Florida where bicycle riding IS possible in February, but the weather has been wetter and colder so we have had limited opportunities for testing the seats. So far, after getting used to the narrower seat, we do feel the gel cover is doing a good job for casual cycling. We can do a 5-mile loop around our development (without going out on a main road)."
2,vitesse Gel Bicycle Seat Cover.,"I take a spin class and think the seats on those bikes are the most uncomfortable seats ever.When I saw this seat cover I thought my prayers had been answered well, I was very wrong. They feel like they would make a big difference but they don't. I don't even use it."
1,Seems nice.....,So Amazon paired this seat cover with the Confidence Stow Away Bike but it does NOT fit it! The stock seat on the exercise bike is too wide and a long to fit.
2,Nothing Special,"Recommended for and purchased with Confidence Foldable Stow Away Exercise Bike.This seat is softer than the seat on the stationary bike that I bought it for, but it didn't really make anything more comfortable. It is actually smaller than the seat on the bike, even though it was recommended for the bike. I had to sort of stretch it and rip a few stitches to fit it. Not really worth it in the end."
1,"Amazon recommends with Confidence USA bike, but it doesn't fit the seat","Good job, Amazon. You'll probably hassle me about the return, too, since it's already opened."
3,It's okay,"I thought I would get more comfort than this. I thought wrong. The first time I used the cover, it was just okay. The second time I used it, the cover actually fell off the seat in the middle of my cycling class. So I'm not really sure if I sould have even bought it. I probably should have just allowed myself to get use to the seat..."
4,"Ahhhh, much better",This squishy cover was super easy to put over my existing bike seat. Definitely does the job for extra cushioning.
2,Did not fit the bicycle seat,"I bought this seat cover for the Confidence Foldable Stow Away Exercise Bike which I also purchased here on Amazon. In fact, this seat cover was ""paired"" with the exercise bike by Amazon when they try to upsell you with the ""other customers also bought this"" message. So I did. When it arrived it was too small to fit on the exercise bike. I kept it to use on my regular bicycle, but it annoyed me that it would be ""recommended"" but not fit the item it was recommended for."
2,"GREAT SEAT COVER, BUT IT JUST DOESN'T FIT. BEWARE!","As a prospective buyer of this product can observe by just skimming the reviews on Amazon.com, there are a lot of bicycles this seat cover just doesn't fit. Mine (a Confidence Foldable Stow Away Exercise Bike - I really like it!) is no exception.So be careful to check the seat measurements before you order, and don't just take the manufacturer's or seller's word for it that it's going to be okay. It seems to me that a lot of people are being ripped off. Not fair!By the way, if you are one of the lucky ones and the seat does fit your bicyle, it does seem very nice. Sturdy, and lots of gel in it.If only!"
3,not for women,"I purchased 2 of these covers. The one I use is perfect: It works...reduces a lot of but strain. BUT the one for my wife moves all over the place, in spite of anything I try. I am sending this one back to Amazon for a refund. I would recommend this cover for men, however...NOT for women!!!!!"
2,Not as comfortable as I'd expected.,The gel inside the seat cover split during the first week I had it and it wasn't at all comfortable. I had to readjust it every time I rode because the seat cover shifted to the side.
2,Wrong size.,"Looks and feels like a good seat cover; however, it was too small for my bike so I had to return it."
3,Requires foreplay.,"It appears to be a great capo until I put it on my guitar. I feel that I have a somewhat normal guitar, a Fender acoustic, but if I slap on this capo randomly, sometimes the top or bottom string will buzz. I usually have to fiddle with it by slightly adjusting it's depth over the guitar to get it perfectly doing it's job with no buzz on any strings. Once it's in that sweet spot I can play away until I have to switch to another fret. I don't recall having to do this with my other capo."
5,Thanks Gabo for the worded memories .,"This book happens to be one of the books I would recommend for clean enjoyment. It was full of laughs and brought back fond memories. Gabo, you are the best, your work is superb and will be enjoyed by all ages. This is now in my home libray, in my family and friends possession as well, and my children are enjoying reading some cultural memories of their parents. I read ""Rain on a tin roof"" several nights in wintry England when there was ""Snow on a slate roof"". This book brought warmth to my heart and soul and brightened dark sprits . I enjoyed every bite of this book. Gabo, you are a fantastic writer and thinker, your imagination and memories is a cut above the rest. PLEASE, PLEASE on behalf of myself and my children, we are pleading we want more of this stuff. You are the best. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
2,The photo was incorrect.,The pan sent was a round grill pan with heavily sloped sidesand a very small grill surface of about 5-6 inches. The squareone in photo would have corrected this design flaw. The pan isvery heavy and appears well made so I decided to keep it. It isnot a good buy if your family includes more than one person.Another issue was that they don't recommend using high heat dueto a potential separation of the copper base. No directions onwhether the pan is dishwasher safe or not.
4,good product,"this product is good, but i did think it was a little short. It also said there was 2 disks on the cover, but when I opened it I only found 1 disk. Overall its a great DVD, very funny."
4,Gotta love cops,"it wasn't what i was expecting..the 20th anniversary episode was highlights, clips of most memorable moments...which just made me go WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? i mean in conclusion...example: a really bad crash...did that guy live??? lol but the dvd had HOURS of extra's which was really cool. It also shows you how cops came to be, and how stupid fox was at first about it."
4,mixture of a bunch of clips.,"well i got this because, well who dosent love the show cops!? The dvd did show alot of clips ive never seen before, but i would have expected alot more. they come in two dvds. since i only got it for 15 bucks i gotta say it was worth it."
2,so-so item,severely chopped recaps of a number of earlier shows. would have been better served if they would have chosen a few items and run them completely. Not worth the price.
3,Lies Lies Lies,"So I bought this thinking it was uncensored. On the back of the case it states, Nudity, Adult Language, etc. Definitely not, its just as censored as the show on tv. I was very disappointed, I was hoping for a collection like Cops too hot for tv that came out a while back. There is some decent content. But over all its just to many beeps and blurs to be enjoyable for a DVD release."
1,COMPLETE BLATANT MISREPRENTATION. Total RIPOFF.,"If you purchased this like I was a fool to do, either do not open or chuck it in the closet with the rest of the trash.Cuz you've just spent 20 bucks on the exact same thing shown on TV. The back of the cover clearly reads: WARNING! THIS PROGRAM CONTAINS NUDITY, ADULT LANGUAGE AND MATURE SUBJECT MATTER. PARENTAL DISCRETION IS EXTREMELY ADVISED.There is zero nudity and zero language. I will be contacting 20th Century Fox for a complete refund or worse if they do not recall all copies with such blatant [...]."
1,Dead - no fix date in sight - it's been months,"Junk. Unpacked, plugged in, turned on, worked for about 5 hours and then dead - nothing. Called Philips, told me I needed it serviced. They won't take it back because it was Factory Renewed. The nearest authorized service center is 45 miles away - the service center won't pick it up since they have had a hard time getting mileage reimbursed from Philips. It's been sitting in his shop waiting for parts for almost two months. Philips is out of stock for the needed part - it appears a lot of these sets are having the same problem - all sizes. The authorized dealer had a stack of Philips TV's waiting for this part. My warranty will be expired before I even get my TV back. I would not buy this Philips TV again! As I write this review, it has been waiting for the part for 8+ months."
2,UNRELIABLE,"We purchased this unit 13-months ago. It has failed and was only supplied with a 1-year parts-only warranty. Too heavy for me to carry to a service center. Besides, I'm not going to get screwed by some ""TV tech"" for a couple hundred bucks. Check the internet and you'll see bunches of people experiencing the same problem my set has. I'll never purchase anything else from Philips. Had a great picture while it lasted..."
1,Junk TV,"Bought this TV in Feb 2005,went dead on May .Had it for 4 months.Authorised Service guy had a look at the Tv and has orderd for a part from Philips.Its been 4 months since then ,TV is still sitting in my living room. Philips Consumer Service is bad.They say they will get back in 3-4 days and never get back.Thsi ahs been happenign for the past 2 months.I have been reading a lot about similar problems philips Tv has been having on the net.If anyone of you is facing similar problems,put in a complaint with BBB.Take my advice pay a lil more and get a Sony."
1,BROKEN,I have had this TV ~8 months and it crapped out while watching TV. I google the problem and find others with exact same problem. There was one site that said replacing a thermistor on the board would fix the problem but it was for a 27pt6441. My #3523 Thermistor is reading 3.8Ohms I dont know if that is right. It will cost me $10 to experiment and replace it.
1,As a friend of the late Erik Braunn's...,"and as an avid IB fan... I have to say, to hell with this album. this was by far the worst pile of garbage the band EVER put out. Erik Braunn was a million times the guitar player Pinera or Rhino are...and I'm saying that to Braunn's praise, not to either of the latters' detriment, they're both great. But the songs are unimaginitive and it's clear where most of the fire on the previous albums came from...a 17 year old who was booted out for having too many creative ideas of his own. IB owed Atlantic another album after this one, but Doug Ingle quit the band and forefitted the deal... forever severing ties between Iron Butterfly and Atlantic records. But considering what a pile of crap this album is, the fact that they didn't follow it up should be seen as a mercy. So, in conclusion, screw this one, go get a copy of BALL or LIVE."
4,Truly a good album with different contemporay themes!!,"This album is a ""METAMORPHSIS"" for the band!! Several songs point to the current events going on at the time.... This one didn't get the credit it should have! Add this to your collection!!!"
4,one of the best of ironbutterfly,I agree with the other reviews way underrated. loved it alot. you think drugs are a bad thing hey listen to this album you might change your mind
5,Better Than In a Gadda Da Vida,"Everybody knows that Iron Butterfly never received the same attention after In-A-Gadda Da Vida, yet after listening to this album one will wonder why this early hard rock performance faded from the limelight. New Day, the first actual song sounds like the lead guitar part was lifted from the aformentioned song, but is however a very good song. The next 8 songs especially the last should be the reason for purchasing this album. Though some of the songs have rather inane lyrics such as, ""now I know that we are more than friends,"" the instrumental parts of these songs are still very good. The final song ""Butterfly Bleu"" is hands down the best song. The song is 13 minutes of strange 60s wierdness. The guitar works with the vocals to concoct some of the strangest and most bizarre sounds ever heard on this earth. In short buy it just to be freaked out. Have a joint on hand and indulge.Highly recommended to all!"
5,Saving water,"Tap water is out, bottled water is in. My valve was leaking and needed replacement or repair. Getting a small seal for the tap was not possible, so the small cost of a new valve with resultant replacement of the valve handle/seal was small compared to my frustration with having to clean up leaks and loss of water. Glad I found it on Amazon.com"
1,DEFECTIVE VALVE needs to be redesigned!!!!!,"This is a beautiful bottle and easy to fill but it leaks and that is completely unacceptable. I see that numerous other buyers have had this same experience leading me to wonder how long the manufacturer is going to wait until they retool this part. I'm going to send mine back and see if I get a better one. If I do, I'll report back with 5 stars."
1,cheap faucet,"The faucet I bought here leaks. not on the seal area but inside the faucet. when in the closed position, it leaks."
1,4 out of 4 ordered are leaking in the first week,I ordered 4 of these for some beverage decanters I fabricated for a local Palm Springs desert resort hotel. Within a week I was called by my customer to let me know that all four of them were leaking ... not from the place where they go through the wall of the decanter but from where the fluid is normally dispensed.Now I suppose I know why they were so inexpensive :(
5,Excellent! Hyacinth Bucket is the Funniest Woman on Earth!,A must for British comedy fans! How they wrote such good comedy is beyond me. You won't find anything like it in the United States. Good wholesome comedy for the whole family! Thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! END
3,Pretty Good,I use my player quite a bit. It was pretty expensive and you can't put too much music on it but it's great for hard to find music or one hit wonders that you don't want to buy. Rumor has it that a better memory card will come out that is cheaper but it's just a rumor. The sound is okay and you can hear static when no music is playing but it may just be the earphones that come with it.
1,Dont buy an mp3 player!,"If you are rich as hell, go ahead and buy it. But for the price your paying for this, you could get a great Mini Disk player, and even plenty of discs for over 4,500 minutes of recording time. Dont believe me? Goto the Mini Disc section and do the math! Even better, you can record mp3's onto the MiniDisk players, you can also record your voice, your playstation/N64/Dreamcast, VCR, TV, Radio, Tape, everything! I almost bought an mp3 player, and im glad i didn't. MP3's are too expensive compared to Mini-Disks, and if you look at the Mini Disk trend right now, its exactly like the CD trend 10 years ago. They are already making Mini Disk drives fro computers to store info. Just check out the Mini Disks before you buy this, trust me, you'll thank me. If you have any questions, email me, Ill answer them asap!"
1,An insult to all bibliophiles,"If you love books and Leroux's novel in paticular do not buy this book. Although the cover art promises great things, alas the illustrations remind one of a Barbie coloring book, only not as sophisticated. The less said of the butchering this line of books commonly does to great novels, the better. A much better read would be the version illustrated by Hilderbrant as the novel in itself shouldn't be beyond most young readers. For the very young try the Bullseye or Step Up chillers. Both are excellent reads."
4,feeder with storage,"The feeder is original and attractive. Since it stores dog food, it frees up space I'd previously used to store a 15 lb bag. Stainless steel bowls would've looked nicer, in my opinion. Overall, the feeder with storage is convenient and attractive."
3,"It's ""ok""....","I purchased this elevated feeder for my Dobe. I thought it would be great with the extra storage. Except, the storage wouldn't fit my plastic food containers so I am using large ziplocks to keep the food dry. If you have a messy drinker like a Dobe, you'll find that the water seeps through the cut outs for the bowls.Also when I received this, there wasn't assembly instructions included. It was very easy to assemble, but still. There was also a scratch across the top and a damaged corner. Overall, not worth $79. More like $39.(Castlemere CC-880 16"" High White Matte Elevated Pet Feeder with Storage)"
4,feeder,great hight for our dog. one of the bowls didn't fit well so we exchanged it for a new one. came in the matter of days so we were happy. maybe it the bowl or maybe it is our dog.... but water gets everywhere whens she drinks.
3,Almost Good,"This looks good, the bowls are excellent and the unit is sturdy. However, when my Dobie slurps for water it runs down inside the unit and causes damage. It would be ideal if there was a lip arond the bowls."
2,Not the best of JC,"Definitely this is not the best book of JC, as all the books you read about Hollywood is always the same, sex, sex and deceive your couple no matter what, many stories of these couples are the same as in the book American Star of the same author, the only good part of the book the the killer, but is a real small story of him. The book keeps rolling among the same story of deceive for each couple and that makes the read heavy and boring. The book could be written with many pages less and with more thrillers in each story as American Star or any book in the Lucky story."
1,One star because can't give it zero stars,"This was my first - and last - Jackie Collins novel. The ""plot"" is so transparent it's obvious how it was going to end in the first half. It's formula stuff. I had to apologise to my brain for wasting its time. If you love trash, then this probably is for you. But if you have a brain....."
4,so true,i just want to say that i used to live in beverly hills and its just like this. lol! well maybe not exactly but you know.... :) but its a good one from the master of style maybe a little out of date but still so true.....i said taht didnt i.i like the elaine conti chracter because shes human but most of all i like all the poeple in it jackie does them all so wellwell this is my frist review here i hope it helpsthankxxxxxxxxxx guys !!!!!!!!
3,Over 50 ? This is perfect for keeping your joints free.,Does just what it says on the can.If you suffer joint pain then this is the stuff for you. I have been a user of Glucosamine and Chrondroitin for over 10 years and this is the beans.
3,Not what I expected,"It may be the title that is misleading, but I thought this video contained several stories. When I found out it was part of a series, I was disappointed."
1,Poor video for children who like Peter Rabbit,This video reminds me of a poor rendition of an Apple II video game. Purchased it for my son and threw it away after the first viewing.
2,Do not buy this release !!! Get the 2008 instead!!!,"Do not buy this Goodtimes release!!! It's way inferior to the 2008 BBC release! I compared them head to head and the difference is so obvious! The Goodtimes release managed to ruin the picture quality, it sure has to do with the fact that they squeeze the whole thing into two single layer dvds, as opposed to the BBC release who got them on three dvds.Sure, the price it's much lower, but what you missing here cannot be replaced ! I wish someone told me that when I did my buying!"
1,Product description deceptive.,"The description of this product (from the seller ""toomanydiscs00"") says 10 ounce (284 grams) and costs $9.48 with shipping.I received a can of 13 fluid ounce, which is only 6.76 ounce (192 grams).I could have bought a 5.82 ounce (165 grams) can of Ronson for $4.99 at my local Ace Hardware.I consider it a bad deal. The wrong description may be an honest mistake. I will find out if the seller will issue a proportionate credit that I requested.In addition, the description states ""this item is flammible (sic) and cannot ship via USPS"" but mine came via USPS."
4,Our pre-schooler's first alarm clock,"Our 3 1/2-year-old needed to start getting up on his own and starting to get ready in the morning so that everyone could get dressed/ready in time for him to go to pre-K. We let him look online with us and choose an alarm clock. He chose this one. Despite it's retro look, it's batteries and not wind-up. It's very loud, definitely works to wake him up. The only thing I don't like is that the hand to set the alarm time is pretty imprecise, sometimes rings slightly earlier than it looks like it should. Also, b/c it's a 12-hour dial, you can't set the alarm ahead of time. Our kiddo has to be up around 7:30, and if you set the alarm any time before about 8PM the alarm will go off in the evening instead of the morning. He is proud enough of this clock that he brought it to Show and Tell at school. He is starting to understand how to tell time a little bit, and will sometimes bring me the clock and announce what time it is."
3,Not very empowering to women,"Although this book makes good points about discipline in all areas of our lives, I found it hard to read the chapter disciplines of the church when it came down to whether woman can preach. Instead of being empowering to women, it gives off the message that women are false teachers and should not preach. I personally don't think this is a clear interpretation of the scriptures she cites."
2,Didn't work,"i was shocked when i got it doesn't work with arab gulf region cars, we have different frequency, the seller did not specify this information, it's a total loss"
2,"""Slight Color Variation"" is an understatement","This item arrived with no instructions on how to mount it to the wall. There is various mounting hardward included, but I have been installing curtains all over my house without a problem until I came to this. I haven't the faintest idea how the pieces are supposed to attach.Worse yet, the ""willow"" finish has a nice dark look on the photo for the product. It's actually a fairly pale brown. It doesn't at all match the rest of the decor. Of course, now I'm stuck having to return it or dyeing the curtain. I will dye it, but that's extra work for me.The construction is nice. It has a nice hang to it. If you're not too concerned about the exact color and you don't mind solving the hardward riddle, then these curtains will work for you."
1,a waste of money,"what a waste of money!.. I should not have bought this book. There is only about 10% of the solution of the exercise from each chapter, it won't help you learn anything. There are still 90% of the hard exercises that you cannot do because it's just too hard and no hint from this manual at all.I suggest you NOT to buy this book, but seek help from your instructor or tutoring center."
1,very poor sailing story,"If you are a true sailor and look for a good sailing story,do not buy this book. I read abouit 150 pages out of 344 and found very little sailing story. At times I had to stop and think ""what was this book realy about""."
2,no again,"I ordered this product along with grape seed exract as recommended by Dr. Oz on his show, and I didn't lose any weight. Don't buy, you better off buying some chromium picolinate at walmart for $7."
3,GOOD FOR THE BEGINNER NOT FOR THE AMATEUR,"I don't consider my self a gambler, but I think I know how to play roulette and I got some lucky in the past on slots machines, I bought this dvd, thinking that would help me get some tips and maybe a few tricks for my next time at the casino, but this dvd is intented for the first time player, and not an amateur like me, it comes with 3 dvdsDvd 1Blackjack (55min)texas hold em (48min)Dvd 2pai gow poker (29min)baccarat (12min)slots (*) (16min)Dvd 3Craps (44min)roulette. (32min)(*) the slots chapter is not about slots machines, its about video poker slotsIf you don't have any experience, and want to know how to play this dvd is for you, but if you have a little knowledge about gambling, this dvd will tell you everything you already know."
3,Yuban,I feel the product has changed somewhat. Perhaps it's me! I don't care forthis coffee any longer. I may buy it in the grocery store if it's on salefor a low price.
3,This coffee is ok for the price,"I'm not sure it is as decaffeinated as they pretend and it is kind of a regular black coffee with nothing special or particular flavor.I got a 12 ounce can this week for $1.99 at Safeway. I guess that was a good rebate.Overall, I'm not impressed."
1,kids size but sold as adult size,"just says his and her set, nothing about kid size, my 5 year old can wear it but is too small for my 11 year old, unless it is meant to cover the top 2 inches of your head would be great for kids about 3-5"
5,one of our favorites,This book has entertained all four of my boys from ages 1 - 4. Pop up books do not last long with toddlers but are worth the extra fun and sense of surprise they bring. This is one of our two favorite pop-up books and has been read to tatters. Buy it (again and again if need be) and enjoy!PS I cannot believe this book is out of print and only available used!!!
5,excellent and funny book,"This is our family's favourite book for baby/toddlers. My three children, 1, 4 and 6 all love it. Charlie eats lots of food to grow up big and healthy. Beautiful, bright, bold illustrations. Robust pop-ups. And a funny punchline! Great for the adult reader too."
3,"A cheery, funny pop-up",Charlie the Chicken is a bright and cheery book about eating right and growing up big and healthy. It's a tad brief but the pop-ups are huge and the angles are fresh
3,Left on Base,"I'm a big fan of Nero and Archie and also a big fan of baseball, so I chuckled over the title of this book after I learned that one of the three stories takes place at a Giants baseball game. A World Series game, no less, and one attended (grudgingly) by Wolfe himself because he can't say no to a guest. In general, I never find Stout's collections of three as interesting as I find his novels. The stories usually seem quick and easy, without deep thought and hard work given to the situations and clues. In this collection, all three stories are a bit blah. But, as always, they're worth reading for the characters of Archie and Nero."
1,Not pleased,"Nothing like the picture. Gaps in netting MUCH larger. Cheap plastic fasteners. Broke three the first time used. Sounded good, but a waste of money."
5,Fantastic net!,Finally got to use this trailer covering bungee net during my week hunting in remote northern Minnesota. Was great. About a dozen extra hooks.Will get years of service ouuta this baby!
4,tie down,helpful in containing all our cargo- but be careful when you put it away- tangle those hook and it will take you forever to untangle- I've hooked the top on a wall so the bottom hooks hangs down free
1,Bad DVD,"I am not sure if anyone else ran into Bad Audio on this DVD, but the quality was terrible. At some points the Audio Double like Echo but mad the movie seem like two movies were running at the same time. You could not understand a word. Oh well cheap move anyways."
2,Swiss Family Robinson,"We received our purchase in timely manner. However, this was a Christmas gift and unfortunately, there was no mention in the description that the video was ""European"" format. We didn't realize it until we wanted to watch it on Christmas day. Doesn't work on our cd player :)"
1,Swiss Family Robinson,I didn't finish watching this old movie. I thought this was going to be an updated version of the old movie
1,Swiss Family robinson.,I am not sure how good the movie was. I did not realize region two would not play on my equipment.
1,DVD,As a teacher who purchased this DVD for my class I was very disappointed when the DVD did not work in my machine. I then took it home and tried it in my DVD machines at home and it still didn't work. Waste of money. will never purchase from here again.
1,SWISS Family Robinson,The video would not play in any of the DVD'S in this region and I was not aware of this when I purchased it for agift. There was nothing that said it would not play everywhere. Very disappointed.
5,Grandchild favorite,Delivered quickly and as promised! The movie has quickly become one of our grandchildrens' favorite which is great for us because it is also one of our favs. Great service from John Mills!
5,Who doesn't want to live in Swiss Family Robinson?,"I don't remember seeing this as a kid, but as an adult I am a huge Disney fan, so I felt the need to see it at least once. After I saw it once, I had to own it! I already owned some of the Vault Disney stuff and definitely reccomend everyone of them. They are incredible entertainment,untainted by the sometimes horrible world we live in. Every moment of this movie is enjoyable, and I reccomend everyone sees it."
5,Great Disney film!,This is one of the best Disney non-animated films ever. Some of the animal scenes are incredible. Highly recommended for all the family.
4,"For pure escapism and adventure, this is one of the best.","""Swiss Family Robinson"" is a rollicking entertainment from Walt Disney that's just about perfect for old-fashioned film-goers. The scenery, sets, and photography are lush and vigorous. I highly recommend ""Swiss Family Robinson"" to Disney fans or fans of high adventure films."
5,review of Swiss Family Robinson,Excellent movie from a bygone era. looking foward to future movies of this type without excessive violence or car chase scenes to attract the worst in audiences.
4,Wonderful Family Movie,"I first saw this movie when I was only 3 or 4 years old and could have told you only that it had a really cool tree house in it if you asked me about it yesterday. I happened to see it at the video store yesterday and have always had a good feeling about the movie, so I ended up getting it and watching it again.I'm glad I did, because it's a wonderful, well crafted movie from Disney Studios. It's amazing how many images stuck in my mind from that movie when I first saw it years ago. Ernst trying to ride the ostrich, the logs rolling down on the Pirates, the rescue of the animals from the stricken ship on the reefs, and yes, that amazing tree house.Yeah, it's a little sugary sweet, and made in a more innocent age. But it's a Disney movie and it never was meant to be anything more than entertainment for the whole family.And in that it truly suceeds."
4,Great Family Movie,"Classic, wholesome entertainment. A bit on the corny side in places, but just watch the news, the world could use more corny."
1,They should have just said it doesn't work in the United States...,"I never would have purchased this video I would have known that it wasn't going to work in my DVD player. This was a REGION 2 DVD, this means that is doesn't work in DVD players that are sold in the United States. This should have been made clear on the seller's page. Now I am stuck with a worthless DVD because I opened it. I am an elementary school teacher and I had planned on having my kids watch this movie during their last few days of school but due to being sold a worthless REGION 2 DVD that didn't happen."
1,Wrong DVD,"You sent the wrong item, it was a region 2 DVD, I live in the USA. I returned it. How could this happen? I never heard of a region 2 DVD before. Was disappointed, as we all sat down to watch it and was VERY disappointed it did not work. I have ordered MANY DVD's from you and NEVER had any problems. Be careful what you send."
3,"Great fun,great memories","Great movie for the kids! i remember have seen this movie in Guadalajara, México when i was a child, and still fun and great!."
1,swiss family robinson,"I was VERY disappointed in the product. After waiting three weeks for the video to arrive, it is an English version, and will not play on my sony dvd player. Bad business in my opinion."
5,Swiss family Robinson DVD,I ordered the Swiss Family Robinson DVD and received it quickly and it was in excellent shape as promised. I was very pleased with the order.
4,Swiss Family Robinson,I think this is a good movie. I also think you should read the book before you watch the movie. There are some different things between them. I think Disney did a good job on this movie
4,Adventurous and fun,"I rented this for my daughter because I remember watching this when I was a child. My daughter and I both enjoyed watching this. It is a throw back to a simpler, more innocent time when you don't need to worry about language or other things that you don't want to expose your young children to."
5,A true classic!,"The entire family watched this and enjoyed it! 11-year-old boy, 9-year-old girl and 7-year-old boy. Everyone loved it! Wish they still made movies like this... Timeless and so well done."
4,Classic,My six year old loves it. Just ce back from Disney where he went in the tree house so he wanted to see movie. Watched on roku via amazon video streaming then downloaded to iPad for car ride.
2,Got it for the kids,"Classic Dis Movie. Lots of animals and family friendly scenes. For young kids this is perfect, not so much for older kids."
2,MMM...,"This movie is expensive, since it is an old movie the price is a little bit high. It is a good movie for a 5 or 6 year old."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Don't bother wasting your time or money on this movie. I don't care about the quality of the cinematography, the quality of the story is what is lacking. From the elmination of Jack, one of the Robinson children, to the blatant disregard for absolutely any speck of information from the book, this film will make you cringe in horror. Rather, go get the original book, and curl up with your family and read. It's a better use of your time than watching this garbage. It doesn't deserve the one star I was forced to give it."
5,Childhood Favorite,"I grew up watching this movie and it's as good as I remember. Ever since I saw it the first time, I've wanted to live in a tree house; that's still the case."
5,Great family video,"I loved it 30 years ago when I was young kid, and now my kids do too. We need more movies like this,"
1,It's the european version and won't play on American DVD player,"It won't play, waste of my money and time. This should have been clearly started that this was four Europe."
5,Classic!,Great old time Disney flick! Grand kids loved it. It was their request to see the movie. They recently went to Disney in Florida and climbed the Swiss Family Robinson's tree. There was an issue near the end due to the movie freezing several times. I stopped and resumed the movie and that seemed to fix it.
5,Good family movie,Our 10-year wanted to see Swiss Family Robinson. Ordered on-line and watched via Amazon Prime. The movie quality was good however we should have selected the HD version.
5,Classic Disney adventure -- Superlative DVD release,"The folks at Walt Disney Home Video have put together four excellent new ""Vault Disney"" releases that truly showcase DVD technology at its best. ""Swiss Family Robinson,"" one of Walt Disney's best-loved live-action adventures, benefits immensely from DVD technology, especially the wide-screen presentation and THX restored picture and sound quality. The widescreen alone would have satisfied most fans, so the plethora of extras on the supplemental disc are truly special. I have never seen a DVD with so many extras presented in such a creative and easily accessible way. Thank you to everyone at Walt Disney Home Video for this wonderful DVD. Hopefully, more titles will follow in this series (like Third Man on the Mountain, Darby O'Gill and the Little People, The Moonspinners, and Summer Magic) and ALL Disney DVD's will be released in their original theatrical ratios"
4,A great adventure,"A family is shipwrecked on a seemingly uninhabited island. Using the remaining recourses of the wrecked ship they build an elaborate tree house. They have a really nice Christmas scene. Then the adventure begins.This movie has a great family feel to it and I really liked the animal races; it is a classic Disney. Do not dwell on where all the animals came from. The pirate attack scene was suspenseful and gives new meaning to log off. You are kept wondering if, and how they will get out of the precarious situation.Be sure to watch John Mills play a more serious role with his real daughter Hayley Mills in ""The Chalk Garden"" (1964)."
2,Funny with Questionable Family Values,I used to think this was the best film 40 years ago. The men in this film have the ability to make a shopping mall with just a Swiss Army Pocket knife. No one eats or uses the facilities & the women emit make up from their pores. No one rips their clothes. It is a perfectly ridiculous Disney film. I would give this film a 10 if they showed something realistic. Even the Hyenas shown in the film which are shown as vilianary creatures about to attack a helpless donkey look like they need to go on a diet and should be placed on arthritis medication. I like cheesy films but this one sat on the counter too long. Do yourself a favor and save your money. If you still think it might be worth it then rent it to find out it sucks.
5,great family movie,"what can i say that hasn't been said about this classic. it's a great family movie. great way the family comes together to defend itself. great way the boys are entrusted to go out and work for themselves to find a solution. lots of fun and excitement. is a little violent/graphic for a family movie, but no surprises over anything else."
4,SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON,GREAT FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY ! ARRIVED IN TERRIFIC CONDITION.YOUNGSTERS AND TEENS WILL LOVE IT ! (ALSO ANIMAL LOVERS).LOOK FOR SOON-TO -BE FAMOUS SESU HIAKOWA IN HIS FIRST AMERICAN MOVIEAS THE PIRATE CAPTAIN.
3,Interesting disc.,"I found this to be a very interesting collection of songs. Kind of sounds like the Lynch/Pilson ""Wicked Underground"" cd mixed with some Buckcherry and maybe some Love/Hate. For me, I absolutely love about a third of it cause you can hear those chords that define George's style, think that about a third is ok, and think that about a third sounds like space filler songs that don't seem to go anywhere, but that's just me. I think this is a killer group of folks and the cd is worth it for St. Jude, Push It, and Ghandi's Got A gun, which are like my favorite songs in the world right now. The name ""Souls of we"" is outstanding. You can buy the cheaper version with the different cover and save some funds."
2,stylistic mess!!!!!!!!!,"so where to beginn,lynch is the man and as much people hate don dokken ,he has what the most singers of lynch's project dont have a distinctive voice ,i can see why people give it good reviews because the metal heads are desperate for anything heavier,so this is another project cheap attempt to make some money ,because it seems when george was younger he cared more about playin then image sadly, these days it's the otherway around ,the record is absolute pointless le grand sounds like bucketcherry singer and sometimes like other singers go listen to oni logan the last distinctive voice george worked with,this band will be far from good live ,but u need to have a pair of healthy ears to understand that,but everything is subjectiv so if u enjoy this good for u ,i do not ,and lynch appears to be like a washed up boxer reachin for something thats not there anymore instead ,evolve into something better,but hey the man needs to pay his bills too!!!!!!"
3,For anyone who wants to be a travel agent in the UK,"Book seems okay; however it is written for someone who wants to be employed for a travel agency; not for the agency. I was looking for a book to help describe the practice within an agency (back office management, business practices, etc.)."
4,Opinión Personal,"Recordado por muchos como el personaje que vendió gran parte de México, existe un gran desconocimiento de su vida, sus pasiones, su trabajo, su historia. Este libro detalla esos elementos y da un panorama de México durante casi más de un cuarto de siglo. ¿Realmente Santa Anna vendió él solo el país? Esta es una pregunta que el lector puede contestarse leyendo el libro. Lectura obligada sin duda."
4,bulova watch,vary nice looking watch. the only reason im not giving it a 5 is that the bracelet scratches easily. the watch looks and feels very elegant though.
3,wasn't as expected,The movie was oKay had some funny parts. I highly doubt i'll watch it again or recommend it to anyone
1,"Why isn't there a ""0 star"" rating?","Just finished reading the Mad Trapper of Rat River by Dick North--the story of the epic manhunt for Albert Johnson across the Canadian arctic during the winter of 1932--and thought that I'd have a go at the copy of Thomas P. Kelley's Rat River Trapper. Having previously read part of a work by Kelley, I knew that I wasn't in for a factual reconstruction of the story, but thought I'd read it nonetheless. Well, not ten pages in, I'd just about had enough. More of the same old malarky: distorted facts, questionable eye-witness accounts, and outright fabrications. No, I just can't recommend this book--there's simply no point in reading it."
3,Decent Value,"Decent value. Good color, not as soft as you would think. Buttons too widely spaced apart."
1,Terrible Bedding,Don't let the 420 thread count fool you... this material is rough and I don't even use it.
2,Dissapointed,"The duvet had black stains in several places and I was set to send it back but I remembered that I had a ""Tide to go"" pen and was able to get the spots out. Needless to say I was dissapointed in receiving a product that I had to clean."
1,Disappointing,There were stains on the pillows when I received it and I had to make some repairs to the button holes and to the seams. The material was much rougher than I expected for Eqyptian cotton. I guess I got what I paid for.
4,Wash it 2-3 times and dry it with dryer sheets and they feel like 1000 thread count,"Get them. Really. I have bought this set twice. Once for college use and then later for my home. It's amazingly soft and comfy, thick and durable. The buttons of the bottom are really widely spaced out and my comforter sticks out. It needs more buttons. Otherwide, it looks fancy, it doesn't get dirty that fast and its comfy on the sennsitive skin. The pillowcases are a wee bit small. ""standard size"" I should say. But it seemed like most americans use giant pillows with queen and king size beds, so ull need larger pillowcases."
2,The worst duvet set!!!,This set is awful! I don't believe they are 420TC Egyptian cotton. It's not soft in the least bit and when you wash it - it wrinkles terribly...even when you tumble dry.
1,bad service,It would have been nice if I got the items. I specifically asked if they are signature confirmation and was told they are not. I never received them.I shop here all the time and they couldn't even give a compensation.
4,good for work,these gloves are good for work... at least the work i do. high quality for a low price. the only problem is sometimes they run small for some reason
3,"Not the best, but still fun to watch.","In GRAIL the Arthurian Lore in introduced to the B5 universe. Not a very successful episode, since the same thing is done in ""A late delivery from Avalon"" in a brilliant way. Anyway, this episode has some good hints, including info on what happened to the previous 4 stations and a mind absorbing evil creature that resides in a Vorlon environmental suit.In ""Eyes"" Sinclair faces court martial. Boring"
3,A word of caution on the 'other' tracks...,"I purchased this single CD because another Bosson hit, ""One in a Million"", was listed among the 'extra' tracks. To my dismay, I found this was only a 38-second excerpt of that song, as well as two of the other tracks. Only the title and last tracks are full-length, so if just those interest you, no problem.'Where Are You' was not as much to my taste as the full length version of Bosson's ""One in a Million"", but still holds its own for the kind of music style it represents."
3,"ThiS soNgs cOoL, bUT nOT thE bEst","hEy pEoPLe, im a kiisfm liStEnEr iN Los aNGeLEs. I jUs bOUt tHis Cd. iTs pReTtY cOoL, bUt nEeDs LonGeR soNgs. iT oNLy hAs tWo fuLL soNGs. this Cd iS gOod buT nOT as GoOd aS hiS We LiVe sINgLE"
3,SMALL tow dolly strap,"SMALL WHEEL NET!!!! Seems to be a decent product but the biggest tire I could get it to fit was a 14 inch. Also, why does the description describe a ratchet? All you get is a tiny wheel net and the metal clamp on one end. Luckily my dolly has a ratchet built on it. It will be ok if I ever need to pull a small vehicle but all that I own have 15 inch and larger so I have to buy another set... Don't buy this unless all you intend to pull is small cars with 14 inch wheel or less."
1,not as repesented,"NO Ratchet included as advertised.I returned this product and am waiting for a refund?Very small will not even fit a 15"" tire"
4,SMALL FIT,"I purchased these straps to haul a 1999 Chevy Cavalier behind my motor home on my tow dolly. I was replacing two older straps that were for a much larger vehicle. Based on a review I had read about these being small but able to fit a tire up to a 14"" I gave them a try. This was a mistake... They are BARELY big enough for a 14"". A 13"" would be its top size I believe.As far as the actual quality of the straps they are really good. A little testimonial to there durability, we had one slip off the tire and drag for at least 30 minutes in between stops. They do take some time to stretch out so for the first 1000 miles every time we stopped I would check them.It would be nice if the seller would put more details on the listing.... like tire size."
2,description could have been better,"The description did not include the length of the straps. Therefore I took a chance in ordering them. Tire size should be included. I asked about changing/exchanging for longer ones but don't know how to get a hold of anyone to do this. They are designed for ratchet type tie downs, they are not included."
5,"How bad before it's good? Is there a limit? Yeah, there's a limit.","I just came here from Obscurus Lupa. The review shows a bad, bad movie, but she assures me we must see it, so here goes. Everything is so... bad, you have to wonder just how hard they worked to make it look so bad. I can imagine them filming. ""No, you're not running in place badly enough. Hey, can we make the backgrounds look more cartoony? Phil, what's the WORST sound editing software you can find?""This just makes me appreciate the Smurfs in comparison."
1,Painful.... which makes it a top pick if you like to mock movies (like MST3000).,"My son and I seek out the lowest rated movies as a test of enduring the pain to watch as well as a test of creative verbiage to mock. This fits well into that realm. Filmed completely with ""green screen"" this film is a ""MUST SEE"" to completely ruin your day.... unless you take upon yourself the challenge ""to endure... and to mock"". WARNING; you will need a very low sense of good humor that is unbecoming of the intelligence required to articulate the full level of mockability for this mockbuster. If that is your intent then go for broke... as you may actually break watching it. We compare this to Brett Kelly (producer) films... if you like them then you will like ""The Amazing Bulk""."
1,Absolute worst pile of garbage ever laid on video,"I suspect, like they did in the IMDB, people who worked on this little video will be invading this section with fake reviews, essentially calling this the next ""Citizen Kane."" You'd think by the title was a spoof on the Hulk but it's actually not. It's just a poorly made (and saying ""poorly made"" doesn't do the phrase justice) rip off of the Hulk, entirely shot on green screen with CGI from 1992. I assume they thought it was kind of like a comic book but the backgrounds were created by a six year old. There isn't anyone who can remotely act in this turd - and sadly, it's not even good as one of those ""so bad it's good"" type films. It's just bad. And when I say bad CGI, I do not exaggerate. I sincerely believe the 11 year old who did the CGI for this thing got the software off some freeware site on the internet. There isn't anything remotely entertaining about this pile of garbage. Do not waste your money on this."
1,What does this mean,"What is Darktwon? What is Bal? What is Swance? What is Sault Ste?If I recognized the songs, I might buy the CD."
3,ok,this radio pen was very cheap and I don't think it ever worked. I would not recomend this product to anyone.
5,The War on Terrorism,"The book is an excellent resource concerning terrorism, which has been the concern today. It focuses on the ethics of terrorism and uses a scriptural foundation to validate reasoning. I am almost finished with this book. I am using this book as a part of our readings in a class on the Ethics and Theology of Violence in seminary."
3,Reporter's Take,"I bought this tape recorder less than a year ago and I am already in the market for another one. First of all, don't believe the product description. This would be terrible for recording lectures. Even if you are right up against your interview subject, if there is other noise in the room you will not pick his voice up clearly.Recently, interviews have started to be cut off in the middle with the rest of the tape white noise.And if you are outdoors, if there is a slight breeze, all you will hear is the roar of the wind. (But no voice.)Yuck."
2,cuts off during dictaiton,am an MD. bad writing. dropped and busted panasonic. this one seems rugged. BUT even when VOR off turns off at least once during dictiation. It's maddening!!
1,Disgraceful Product,The single biggest problem with this recorder is it does NOT warn you adequately when the battery is running low. This means the doctor just keeps on dictating and dictating until the light goes out and then changes the battery. He is completely unaware that the battery ACTUALLY ran out five patients ago...and then I get a tape with nothing but vaguely muffled sounds on it. And then the doctor has to re-dictate everything. And then we get behind schedule...and patients scream...and other doctors' offices scream for the reports. And I am up until 3:00 AM typing the newly dictated reports. Honestly. This device could kill a medical practice. JUST DO NOT BUY IT.
1,"Doesn't matter that ""it's a Sony""","I'm sorry to say this about a Sony... but this is a piece of JUNK. I bought it to get through a few transcriptions and never use it again (I've moved on to digital recorders)... my OLD recorder (20+ yrs old) was giving me grief... making hissing and whistling sounds that wouldn't go away unless I tapped (hammered) it on a table for a few seconds. Anyway, the playback volume on this recorder was so low I couldn't hear ANYTHING. I packed it up, sent it back and hammered away with my old, faithful but glitchy, recorder.... thankfully I'm DONE transcribing those micro-cassettes!"
5,"used;but best of best,as always our trust in amazon.com","when in hunting for bargins let's all meet on amazon.com it,s there ..all the problems i have on the internet,amazon.com takes it all away.any problem will be cleared up.trust amazon's staff.thanks amazon.com leroy parks."
4,Possibly the best masked wrestler ever,"if you like Santo movies, this is classic.The Martians have Gold stretch pants,capes and padded hats with blonde hair proturding and make several remarks about Earthlings looking funny......"
5,Great Resource to Explore Stews Worldwide,"Received this as gift, and will for sure have fun exploring cooking around the world with this cookbook. It features over 300 recipes from over 50 countries with wide variety of main ingredients, which is the organizational reference.Tried so far limited to Swedish Sausage and Brussels Sprout Stew; German Chicken Stew with Caraway Dumplings; and Lamb Shank, Artichoke and Potato Stew. Don't let my tendency to cook the out-of-the-ordinary recipe, for this cookbook is loaded with the to-be expected stew recipes, e.g. Stroganoff, Beef Stew, Coq Au Vin, etc.There is truly something here for everyone, for the basic type cook to the more exotic one who likes to venture out with the different ingredient i.e. rabbit, duck, veal, etc. The only thing that would have improved on this cookbook for me would have been a few color photos, but realizing the expense of this, does not detract from the value this one will have in my collection and possibly in yours."
1,did not furnish info I needed,"It was not a book for me as it did not give me the information I needed and so I can not use it, Thank You, RoseMary Hove."
3,A tad disappointed,"Though it does explain various techniques of oil painting, it really doesn't go into depth of each one. I thought the examples for each technique were barely touched upon and the style of paintings used for the explanations were the wrong examples to use. All in all, this is a poor book or reference to use if you are a beginner or going to the next step. Glazing for example is barely given attention; this is sad because glazing is a big part of oil painting. I could get a lot more information on glazing just looking for it on the net. This book isn't necessary to really have. So, sorry to say it will go on the shelf and stay there. I was disappointed."
5,Complete and Intuitive look at the oil medium,"I've been painting on and off since i was 13, I'm 23 now and am starting to get into it heavily once again. For me I needed something to replace the art teacher that inspired me and gave me direction in high school. This isn't as good as Mr. Murphy but it's pretty close. It's easy to read and I think it would be easy for everyone from an expert to a beginner to find useful information in it. I bought mine used and it came in perfect condition with the original reciept from the early 90s. It's a great book and it's worth having for any painter who just wants to know more or needs a slight refresher."
3,Encyclopedia Of Oil Painting techniques,"I'm sure it was a good book , but not what I was looking for. It does have a lot of instruction on different techniques."
3,The Encyclopedia of Oil Painting Techniques,"I do have a book somewhat like this, I have seen better. I am just looking at various techniques in this book so I can incorporate some of my own techniques"
2,Looking for Butterfinger,"I bought this product because my husband has been raving about a butterfinger coffee that he used to drink while in school. I have been searching for a good substitute and I found this particular brand on Amazon. Unfortunately, it did not live up to our expectations. It didn't taste like butterfingers and the smell was definitely not there.In all fairness, we are not big coffee drinkers but will indulge in a good cup of java anytime.In the meantime...we are still looking for Butterfinger."
1,Junk,"I bought these trimmers to trim around my pool deck because my brother in law had an earlier model and loved them. Let me tell you they are a complete piece of junk. They will not trim more than a couple blades of grass thick, after using them about 3 times they just completely died. I would never buy them again."
1,Junk junk junk,"This thing is horrid. After a 48 hour charge, I was able to get 5 minutes of use out of it before the battery died. To make matters worse, during that five minutes the thing clogged up constantly - on a single blade of grass, no less!"
2,Weak,"The GS700 cordless grass shears work best with sparcely growing grass and grind to a halt when challenged with thick clumps of grass. The shears must be charged immediately prior to use, which requires them to be always plugged-in unless you are very scheduled with your yard work."
1,Black and Decker is Junk,Battery dies quickly then goes permanenty dead after a few charges. Don't why I bought another black and decker product.
5,powerful and easy to use,Great product! It's very powerful and lasts a long time before it has to be recharged. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to manicure their lawn. This trimmer allows you to take care of those small areas that the lawn cutters miss and weed whackers can not do or would damage. Leaves a neat look around landscaping beds or walkways.
1,Don't waste your money,"Even with a full charge, this feeble trimmer jams if you try to cut more than a few blades of grass. It is a completely inferior product. I can not find the receipt so mine is headed for the trash. I wouldn't even give this product to charity it is so bad."
1,Cordless Grass Shears,They are less efficient than I expected. The cutting quality is poor. Next time I'll opt for a goat
2,Doesn't Go The Distance,"I bought this in May and am disappointed and disgruntled. The first time I used it, the charge lasted about twenty minutes. Subsequent attempts to use this after a full charge have been providing me with less usage time before having to recharge it yet again. I am lucky to get 7 or 8 minutes now and I have to finish the job with a cord trimmer. This might not seem like a big deal, but I have a large yard and a lot of fencing and landscaping to trim around and this just doen't cut it in terms of a dependable and long lasting charge. When the battery is functioning properly it does a decent job of trimming, but I can't recommend it to anyone with a large yard because you'll very possibly trimming for days.There are two things that are nice about this trimmer. It is easy to hold and it does a nice job when it comes to trimming grass in tight places. If you don't need long battery life, this trimmer may be great for someone with a small yard or no need to trim a lot."
1,Kills your thumb!,"We bought this grass shears because we have had great success with other Black & Decker products. However, after just a few minutes of using these shears, your thumb can't take any more. I understand the need for safety but it is ridiculous that you can't turn this tool on without having to hold the trigger and the thumb switch at the same time. I guess you can't trust people to turn something on and off. When I operate my battery lawn mower, I only have to hold one switch down. I am now going to replace these shears. You will see these for sale on E-Bay shortly!!"
4,cordless grass shears,Product is as described. Previously had one of these and it works great for close areas where an edger or weedeater cannot safely be used. Product was delivered within the time frame promised.
1,Junk,I own a lot of power equipment and this thing wins the award for the biggest waste of $$. Other B&D products I own work well. What a let down!
5,Perfect Trimmer,"I was looking for an electric triimmer for trimming around landscaping and the sidewalk. This has been perfect. It's easy to handle and does a nice job trimming even higher, thicker grass and weeds. I would highly recommend this item, especially at such a good price and from a reputable company."
1,Don't be fooled by Good Times Version,"Please read reviews for the other Good Times releases of MCLINTOCK and don't be fooled into buying this set either. Only the Authorized cut of this film put out by the John Wayne Foundation is the theatrical release print! The Good Times version is a full 45 minutes shorter and contains a completely different music score. This DVD is pan&scan as well, not the full Panavision widescreen image. Hopefully the Wayne Foundation will soon release the full cut on DVD, but until then the authorized VHS version is the only acceptable video available."
2,James is right but...,"I bought this by mistake. This copy of Mclintock is terrible. It's pan and scan and a bad transfer to boot. The colors are dull and blurry. This movie is unwatchable.Having said all this, there is another DVD in this two pack. On it are Blue Steel and Hell Town(or Born to the west). I had never seen an early John Wayne movie. Having watched both, I have a new respect for John Wayne as an actor.The image on Blue Steel is very good. I'd say about 95% is crisp. For example, Wayne rides a white horse that is a vibrant white. There are a few frames that are washed out and murky. Overall this seems to be a good quality copy. The sound on this copy though isn't good. There is alot of hissing and dropout. The story is engaging.Hell Town is Blue Steel's opposite. The image is dull and murky, but the sound does not have alot of hiss. Again this is an engaging, interesting story(with Wayne starting as a bad seed).Overall I would stay away, unless you want a good copy of Blue Steel."
5,great charger,This is a great charger. It has a loud beep when battery is plugged in to charge and when its finished.
5,Fantastic Movie to be Watched OVER and OVER Again!!,"This is one of my most favorite movies ever! I brings to life a simple romance in the midst of war. The actors are really good, and story line is clean. I would recomend for anyone of any age. I remember when I was 6 or 7 and my parents were watching it and I remember little bits of it. Then about a month ago I saw it at the library and instantly recognized it, even though I hadn't seen the cover for almost a decade. I also have a fine on it at the library for having it too long..."
3,same name as a more famous film about Hemingway,"A British commando unit is captured on an Italian beach and sentto an orphanage-mansion converted to a prisoner of war camp.When Italy leaves the war the prison commander sets the English prisoners free.The young officer Eric Newby has broken his leg telling everyonethe Germans were down the road.The rest of the prisoners escape north toward Switzerlandleaving him behind ( only to be recaptured by the Germans).He is taken to a convent hospitalwhere the doctor's young nurse volunteers to teach him Italian.They fall in love and the rest of the movie is about him,ansd it seems like half of Itality is trying to help himand the other half to turn him in.It is a nice heart warming love story about a rural communityin Italy during WWII."
5,Wonderful!,I cried when I first viewed this book in one of my child's doctor's offices and knew I had to own it. Anyone who has an autistic child will understand and those who don't will be able to get a sense of what living in dual worlds is like for both.
2,"Rather superficial, and hard to read","I was excited to find this book at my local bookstore, since I'm a fan of the reality show. Unfortunately the book proves to be very superficial, with tips of questionable quality and substance.Five topics are covered: food, clothing, grooming, decoration, and culture. I was hoping to get some ""insider"" tips on how to color-match my wardrobe and how to pick out power ties for different vacations. Nope, neither topic is in there. Plus a lot of other tips I was hoping to get. Instead you get two pages on how to remove nose hair and some other equally useless stuff. And this book is expensive! A lot of information is not organized logically so it's hard to follow... at least for an artistically challenged person like myself.Not recommended, although you could read it over coffee at your local bookstore."
2,I did learn a valuable lesson...,"This book covers a lot of what the show says and has to offer. You might as well just watch the show, and have a pencil and some paper ready. It does however, cover a lot of topics such as grooming, decorating, fashion and culture. I bought the book for my straight brother, to try to get him to change some of his not-so-desired habits, and in the end, I realized I might as well just have told him myself. I have gotten out of this a lesson: (Straight) Men will be men, and the ""Fab Five"" can tell you the exact same things as five women, so if they won't listen to a woman, they are even more unlikely to listen to a gay man who sounds like a woman. Not worth my money."
5,Husband loved it!,My husband loves Pasha. I was so glad I got this. It was the same great smell for a better price.
5,Great product at a low price!,"I needed am armband for my Zen, but all the ones I found were quite expensive. I tried this, based on good reviews by others, and I am not disappointed. The armband fits great and meets my needs."
2,Not very helpful,"I thought it would protect my player, but the belt and clip system is clumsy. The case does not cover the screen, the part I worry about the most. My MP3 has to be reset often ?????, and the cover doesn't have any opening for the iddy-bitty little hole that you need to reset the player. I gave it two stars only because it does protect it some when dropped, which I do often, hence the reset button."
2,No Instructions and all Buttons are not exposed for Use,"This product arrived very quickly although the S&H; was almost the price of the item. There are zero instructions explaining how to attach the arm band or belt clip to the rubber case. The buttons on the right side of the Zen V Plus are covered so I have to remove the case in order to use the power or volume buttons. The screen has no protection.If anyone can explain how to attach the arm and belt clip to the case, this would really be appreciated. I am too old and tired to try and figure it out.I have already ordered another kit (a leather case with a belt clip) which I hope will be easier to use and not require any assembly."
3,Silicone Skin for Creative Zen V,The quality of this product is marginal. The clip does not fit on securely so the player does not stay upright while clipped on.
3,cheesy,I was needing a clip for my belt and had to buy the whole kit to get it. Loved the skin but the clip it self was made out of cheep thin plastic and seems a little unstable. It does the job but I thought I would be getting a clip similar to the clip that came with my older Creative MP3. The player spins around on the clip instead of staying in one place.
1,It's not worth it...,"Because of the thick vinil, you hardly operate the MP3 player. The hard cover plastic that goes on the screen does not stay unless the case is empty...what's the use?"
1,flimsy price for a flimsy product,I was pretty disappointed with this product mainly because of the belt clip; it is made out of a really cheap plastic and I'm afraid to run with it. It was definitely not what I was expecting.
2,very cheap looking case,I really disliked this case. I don't think it fits the product well and its just ugly.
3,Belt Clip,"The Silicone case cover and armband work just great. Looks good, protects well and easy to use.The only problem is the Belt clip. Unless I am doing something wrong the belt clip is very had to attach and does not go on all the way and does not swivel when attached.I am able to use but am a little disapointed in the belt clip. (again I may not be attaching it correctly)."
4,Zen silicone holder,I only complaint I have is that it covers the volume button. The armband is very adjustable. It works great.
1,This silicone skin is a dud!,"i bought this skin for my zen V. i am a regular runner and rely heavily on the mp3 clip-on or armband. Bu.. the clip-on for this skin is too flimsy to support the light mp3. And using it with the armband? after 5 times using it as attached to the arm-band, the skin started to tear. there is no protection for the display.the design of this skin needs a lot of rework. too expensive for a piece of for what it is.zen v needs to provide better accessories for their products."
5,Protects the player well,"Offers good protection from falls, but gunk can get stuck underneath if you let it. I occasionally have to peel off the skin to wipe down the unit, but it's scratch-free."
4,Creative lab zen v case cover and armband,I have bought a couple of these for my family and was disconcerted to see only one review which was negative when I ordered mine the other day. My senior at high school has had hers 3 months and runs everyday with it. My husband has only had his since xmas but it seems fine.My complaint is that you cannot buy them in the store and the shipping is as much as the armband. Why they don't provide them when you buy the mp3 player is beyond me!!!!!!!!!!
4,So green and pretty!,"I love the case and accessories I purchased for my Creative Zen V. The purchase price was extremely reasonable. I love using the armband because it keeps my player out of my way while I'm working on the computer. Overall, the product is excellent. My only complaint is that it picks up lint and dust easily, but I think that is the case with mose silicone products."
1,Poor Quality,Belt clip broke after one month of light use. I sent email to seller and got no reply. Shipping was very fast and came way before estimated.
4,Armband is nice...,"The armband is nice, but the belt clip and lanyard look cheap so I just threw them away."
2,What happened?,"I remember when No Warning was one of the best new bands in hardcore. What happened? Ill Blood and their S/T were two of the greatest hardcore albums to come out within the last couple of years. If you're a fan of the old No Warning don't get this, it'll make you cry. I'm not joking either, it's freaking depressing. Don't listen to all the Projekt Revolution reviewers. Bunch of 13 year old girls who know nothing about hardcore. I can only hope that No Warning comes back to their senses and a.) gets back on a hardcore label, preferably Bridge Nine. b.)stop acting like they are linkin park(sum 41 for that matter). c.) stops printing this abomination. The only track worth listening to is Dirtier Than the Next. Even that gets pretty 'linkin parkish' towards the end. Disappointing.....very very disappointing."
1,These guys should be jailed for selling out so bad,"When I first saw No Warning on the Hellfest 2003 DVD I thought wow this is one of the youngest, most full of energy tough guy hardcore bands I've seen in a long time. There music used to be tough as nails, and this album was supposed to be the album that put them up there with the rest of the tough guy hardcore kings. I had NO IDEA that this band got signed to Linkin Park's label, and also went on the POSER REVOLUTION tour. This is probably one of the biggest sell outs in history, any band that goes from making hardcore as hard as these guys used to make it to this AUTROCITY shouldn't be allowed to make music. I say if you're gonna completely abandon your sound and start ripping off Linkin Park at least change your name. The next time any of you hardcore kids see these guys be sure to throw stuff at them pathetic SELLOUTS"
1,how many versions,"the stories in this set is ok, but I have seen most of the episode on another set, and how many times are they going to reincarnate the set?this is like listening to Elvis' Burning Love all 45 different versions of it."
2,Disappointingly Slanted,"I skimmed this book in a bookstore and thought it would be a great volume to inform me for debating current political issues with better regard to their historical foundations. I bought the book on Amazon and upon reading it, I was disappointed in the author's leftist slant. He blames most world problems on the United States in any spurious way he can derive.There are some useful facts here, but read this book with a grain of salt if you have it, or buy a better book if you do not. It is one thing to take a position and justify it, like Jared Diamond in ""Guns, Germs and Steel"", an excellent book, though I disagree with his premises. It is another thing to do as Strauss does in this book and lbindly take a slant, possibly even unaware of the slant, and meander through a supposedly historical acocunt whilst rewriting it to suit your tastes.I wish there was more consistency in the quality of ""Complete Idiot's guide to..."" books."
5,Excellent,"This book is quite good. It covers a lot of ground, is even-handed, and deals with issues fairly by giving both points of view. It's amazing to read what people do to each other, and the book endeavors to succinctly explain the varied reasons humans are so often in conflict. Well-written and excellent."
1,Not worth the money,"The price is good, however the tech details say you'll get 2 times the image, which is not correct. The most annoying feature is the circular halo or shadow around the edge when fully zoomed out. I need to slightly zoom in to get rid of the halo, but when you do that the extra wide angle I need is the same as without the lense and on normal camera function.In addition to this, the built in flash is ineffective when using this large lense."
4,percussive guitar,"I've grown old listening to Beatle's music in all forms. Juber plays beautiful rendtions of all the songs on the album especially Let It Be and Martha, My Dear. His searing solos rock you like none that I've ever heard, but he overdoes it with the percussion guitar on almost every number. I wish I could tell Larry himself to leave the percussion to the drum corps."
2,A Better Recommendation for You ...,"Juber is outstanding in concert and is technically great on this CD, but for me, it lacks a sense of joy found in the original songs. For that, I recommend a CD that is among the top 100 of my 10k CD collection: A Beatles Collection by Neil Hogan (Audio CD - 1989).For guitar enthusiasts, I recommend other Juber CDs over this one (even though he played w/ Wings).Also, checkout my favorite guitarist, Pepino D'Augustino, who is light years ahead of the pack."
5,Juber plays top quality acustic guitar.,This album deserves the best rating! Juber's music is both authentic and creative. Juber plays top quality acustic guitar.
5,Fantasic rendition of Beatles classics,LJ has always been one of my favorite artists and this CD just strengthens my love for his wonderful work.
3,WORD BOOK IN PATHOLOGY LABORATORY MEDICINE,"THE BOOK LOOKS LIKE AN EXCELLENT ONE TO USE FOR REFERENCE GUIDE,THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW THE VOCABULARY OR THE LOOK-UP PAGES. I'M HAVING PROBLEM FOLLOWING WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR, VERY CONFUSING. I'M HOPING THEY HAVE GUIDELINE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PAGE ON HOW TO READ THIS BOOK.THANKS"
4,Built 20 oz. Bottle tote,Very nice.All stainless is the way to go for a water or beverage container.Holds plenty of liquid.Stay's cold for quite some time.No more wasting plastic.
3,it works,"I'm not sure which bottle this carrier is made for. I'm using it on my 18oz klean kanteen. It is too tall, so I have to fold it down over the sides quite a bit. It does a good job of insulating the kanteen, whether hot or cold. I just wish they had more than girly pink and blue for the correct sized bottle totes."
3,"Good insulation, but snaps break","Both my wife and I use this Built NY tote for our Klean Kanteens, and it insulates the bottles well. But within a few months of normal daily use the snaps on both our totes have broken-- actually they pulled out of the fabric. Fortunately I have the loop caps on our Klean Kanteens and we can still have the insulation and use carabiners to clip them to our bags. Good item, but the snaps should be a little better."
4,the button is very difficult to detach,"the neoprene bottle holder is exactly what i wanted. i attached it to my camera bag during hikes because my camera bag doesnt have a water bottle holder. the button on the one i received is VERY difficult to undo. i resorted to sticking something between, like a knife or something, to wedge it open. i'm not sure if this is a common issue but it's the only issue i have with mine. otherwise, the bottle holder is perfect for my needs."
2,Disappointing,"Very little about this book justifies Strauss's high reputation. He doesn't define his terms, and it's difficult to decipher his own position when he's always quoting someone else. His use of English, obviously not his native language, is poor. The book needed a severe editor, but Strauss's reputation must have scared everyone away. It's hard to keep in mind anything of what he says."
1,Too Convoluted,"I generally do not have a difficult time with complex books, but I had a terrible time understanding and reading this book. I stuck with it, and found I wasn't rewarded. The book's premise is that there are objective philosophical reasons, and upon this premise, one has to consider the validity of doing history the ""old"" way, rather than submit to historicism. After struggling with the text, I cannot admit I am persuaded by this book, and, in fact, think it naive in light of recent scholarship in both philosophy and history. For those who don't mind obfusication, this probably will be worthwhile reading; but for those of us who do, it was a labor of loss."
1,negative philosophy,"This book shows how ""traditional conservatives"" are just plain dumb. (and apparently all the other reviewers of this book) Here you have a philosopher who at is core is a moral relavist. The classic conservative believes in absolutes, mostly biblical. Yet it is clear that neoconservatives are running the bush administration right now, and most sheepish conservatives do not even realize they are supporting people that are diametrically oppossed to them. What makes neocons dangerous is they are so motivated to be wrong. It is like revenge of the evil nerds. It's the battered wife syndrome. Jews get bullied so long they want to become the bullies. But at least be original, don't just copy nazi germany. Too bad there are not a cult of readers of the book ""lila"" by Pirsig that shows that there is a morality. Thank god for karma, and the fact that we all die eventuallyGod help this country."
2,"Not worth the money, even at a great price","This book is an older version of one that I needed for class, but I still barely used it. It is black and white, very few pictures, and just a very ""dry"" book that is not fun for anyone to read. The material in the book is boring, to say the least."
2,Wrong edition number,I ordered this book with a isbn number provided by my school and instructor. When the book gets here I was informed its the wrong edition and I don't know how to send it back. I need a shipping label if possible
4,WONDERFUL AND ENLIGHTENING,I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE AUTHOR THIS BOOK DID A SUPERB JOB IN PLACING THE EMPHASIS AND KNOWLEDGE OF VARIOUS CULTURES HANDLING OF DEATH. I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THIS BOOK.
2,bad quality,Maybe I got a lemon. The quality of this disc is almost unwatchable. The picture is blurry and the sound is distorted.
4,A must for a Sherlock Holmes fan,"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce made 14 Sherlock Holmes pictures over the course of 1939-1946. While one could argue that the four movies featured on this DVD are not necessarily the ""best"" of those 14 movies, it is still a fine collection. Anyone who is a Sherlock Holmes enthusiast would be well rewarded in purchasing this DVD. The affordable price makes it a good buy for a fan who has recently discovered Holmes and is not ready to purchase a full collection of movies.Spend some time with Basil Rathbone's Holmes; you'll be witnessing THE Holmes for the ages."
5,SHERLOCK HOLMS SERIES,These are great shows and will remain timeless! Good clean mysteries that the entire family can enjoy.
5,Basil Rathbone as SH,The set is one of my favorite movies and I truely enjoy them each time I watch the. The qality is very good and I find them better than my VHS copies from ten years ago. I will be getting more of these soon.
4,Measuring the world: metrics in parallel,"In September 1828, Professor Carl Friedrich Gauss sets out, reluctantly, to attend the German Scientific Congress in Berlin. Gauss, a mathematician and phyicist, will meet Alexander von Humboldt, naturalist and explorer. And so begins a delightful novel, full of humour and contrast.At the end of the 18th century two brilliant young Germans attempt to measure the world. Alexander von Humboldt journeys to South America and undertakes all manner of physical adventures. By contrast, Carl Friedrich Gauss, does not need to leave his home town to learn that parallel lines meet and space is curved.Those interested in the life, times and discoveries of these brilliant scientists will quench that thirst elsewhere. This novel is for those who enjoy reading fiction, imbued with subtle and sometimes sly humour, in which real people feature. Some of the irony is delicious: a scientist concerned with space who does not like travel.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
5,Excellent book!,"Great book if you love German Culture!It is a book that it so well written that you can't stop reading it.If you are interested in Humboldt and the relationship between Germany and Latin America, it is your book."
1,Save your time,"Having just finished Aaron Sachs' superb and eminently readable ""The Humboldt Current"", I thought this a natural for further reading on fascinating Humboldt and his world. Mistake! I gave up in perplexity a third of the way through - trivializing and superficial, awkward, facetious, clearly a translation - spend your time reading Sachs and others instead, and why not Humboldt himself?"
3,Characters are not interesting human beings,"Kehlman writes good prose, and I was interested in the history and science and adventure. The major failure of this book is that neither Humboldt or Gauss is a well realized character, and we are reminded again and again of their shortcomings such as Gauss's impatience. This may be due in part to a limitation in Kehlman's artistic imagination, but the fact is that while great scientists, neither man is a great or interesting human being, at least as depicted in this novel."
2,More characters than I thought...,I was looking for a play that an all female cast could do. The page of the play with the casting information on it was not available on the website. I thought it was for 3 soldiers at a grave site but it was much more than that. I won't be able to use this play. It gets expensive paying $8 to read plays you can't use.
4,Gounod: Romeo et Juliette,"Despite one or two reservations about production points, this will always be a beautifully sung reminder of the RHO performance."
5,Phenomenal!,"Billy Ray Martin is very underated and underappreciated in the U.S. Her voice is soulful. The album has several club favorites from the past, Your loving arms & Running around town. The whole album is phenominal!! A must have!!"
2,This Album kinda sucks...,"I was disappointed. I heard that song Your Loving Arms, and so I bought this album thinking it would be one of those wonderful dance albums... it wasn't... Most of the other songs are slow and sappy. I think I'll go sell it to hastings after I am done writing this..."
1,Author Doesn't Know the Subject,"This book is titled ""Good Ol' Southern Gospel"" but vast majority of the songs listed are not ""Southern Gospel."" While there seems to be some debate as to what Southern Gospel is and when it began (some go back to when quartets were first used to sell song books while others only go back to the 1950's) most of these songs don't fit anyone's definition of ""Southern Gospel."" Most of these songs were written before 1900 and do not have the feel of a ""Southern Gospel"" song. Most ""Southern Gospel"" music has the feel of Country and Western music, but is more upbeat. While these songs could be arranged and sung in the close harmony of Southern Gospel music (and probably have been) they originally were not Southern Gospel. At least one of these songs was not written by an American and others were written by Yankees.These songs are excellent old hymns. Why does the author have to drag them down into being Southern Gospel music?"
4,Redneck 12 Days of Christmas,"Purchased as a Christmas gift. Arrived in plenty of time and in excellent condition. Recipient is very pleased with it. I should have ordered two, one for myself. He won't let me borrow it! Amazon was great to deal with."
5,I love this book..,"i am currently reading this. I am 15, and this book is making me see life in a new way.. i am beginging to like spirituallity.."
5,Spiritual and thought provoking.,"A fun, thought provoking and insightful way to meet the new day. A great book for inspiration and thoughtfulness."
5,Another good one to read,Another one that is in my collection and that I found useful. I think that it has much to teach those that are seeking. Good book to read.
4,364 daily readings,"This book has a short foreword, then a series of 364 segments to read on a daily basis.Some of these are Indian legnds, some of them are poems, etc.You may like a set of short segments to read on a daily basis, but I prefer to read for pleasure instead of short segments.If you have questions or comments. E-Mail me. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda."
3,Classic Story,"Classic story...like Brair Rabbit, social issues undercurrent. I never read this as a child and was supprised at sterotyping of diff. types of animals. I continued to finish it because of the history. But If I had just picked up this book, or one similar, I would not buy it, nor reccomend it."
4,Outlaw Woman,"OUTLAW WOMAN is a vivid and compelling account of the author's journey through the upheaval, hope and ultimate implosion of the 1960s. With a keen eye for detail and a crisp prose style, Dunbar-Ortiz evokes the heady combination of idealism and trauma that defined that era and transformed her from an apolitical, married college student into a notorious feminist leader and later, an underground revolutionary. This is fascinating history, and especially important for young people who are trying to make sense of the socio-political moment in America today. OUTLAW WOMAN is an honest and courageous attempt to examine and reclaim some of the history of an era that still divides and perplexes us thirty years later. A wonderful andimportant read."
2,Bad quality shoes,"Had to replace the shoes once, after I got the replacement I used the shoes on a conference and had to walk a lot, the seam at the front did not hold up and ended up with a big hole on one side of the shoe. Not recommended"
5,Sizing was incorrect,"Shoe fits perfectly & is very comfortable, construction is very good & the pricing was fair.Considering purchasing another pair in another color."
3,"Great Shoe, Poor Packaging","I ordered this shoe as a cheaper alternative to a more expensive boat shoes. The shoe looks great. It is comfortable, classy and fits great. I was upset when I received the package because I opened the package to find a shoe box that looked like it had fallen off a building and then been run over by a tractor. I was relieved when the shoes were in good condition, only a scuff on the toe of one shoe. I'm glad I checked the package before wrapping it as a present because I would have been embarrassed if the recipient opened the package to see the mangled box."
3,"Good shoe, doesn't wear too well","The shoe is pretty good. I have a big foot but can usually wear the normal version of a shoe. I had to get the wide with these. Definitely get the width if you are usually borderline.The shoe looks really nice at first, but if you wear them daily as I have then they will wear it in a matter of months (I've had them for 4 months and they're pretty worn, keep in mind I'm a college student and walk everywhere). A shoelace dry rotted on me and the sole is very uneven after walking with them and the leather has wrinkled a little.For the price, it's ok. If this is your first pair of boat shoes then go for it! It's a great pair to get used to them. If you're an avid boat shoe wearer, stay away."
3,OK shoes,I have had the shoes for about two months. The leather did stretch as expected but I still think i might add a 1/2 size to my normal shoe size. The soles are not very supportive. I would probably try another brand before I bought these again.
1,boat shoe,"I was looking for a comfortable pair of boat shoes. I read the reviews for these shoes and decided to order. Well, I should have listened to many of the reviews because they were really uncomfortable especially in the heel. I would not reccomend these shoes."
3,"Good shoes ,bad laces","The first time I put them on the leather lace broke, the next day the other lace broke. Either old leather or bad quality."
3,Too Narrow,My husband liked the shoe but we had to return. His usually wears a 9.5 M but these were way too narrow and he does not want to re-order.
5,Dockers Boat Shoes,These shoes are exactly what I wanted. They look great and fit perfectly. They came very quickly also.
5,Great shoe,"This is a great shoe overall. They are a great fit, very comfortable, and look great! I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone."
3,Carefully Consider Size.,"Very good quality boat shoe. Superior to comparable brands.Nevertheless, the shoe's (M) could be misleading.As user of Timberland's brand, among others, Dockers is definitely Narrow."
2,Poor quality,"I bought a pair of these shoes at a local shoe store, and I have been very disappointed. I have had them for about six months, and only wear then a couple of days each week. Already the sole of one has split crosswise, and the sole of the other is starting to detach from the uppers. This is what I would have expected from cheap shoes bought at a discount store, not name-brand shoes that cost more than twice as much."
2,Pretty but Painful,"These shoes look really nice and were just what I was looking for in a pair of casuals. The insole is cushy and feels nice to walk on.At first, anyway. I cannot say the same for the rest of the shoe. The grommets in the collar near the backstay (where your achilles tendon meets your heel) are hard as nails and dug holes in my heels that have yet to heal after buying them last week. And this after only a couple of hours wearing them around the house. I don't think I will wait for them to break in because I can't see why a pair of shoes should do that much damage to my feet in so short a time. Not at this price, anyway."
3,theory trying to be history,"If I understand the goal of this book, I appreciate what the authors are trying to do. The book attempts to use history to advance political theory. Some of the chapters are pretty good and use history to examine dynamic processes. However, it doesn't quite work. Others though get lost either in the theory or the history. You get a sense reading some of the chapters that what develops is a theory specific to a particular event, rather than a generalizable theory about politics. Other times, the chapters read no different from a typical political science account. Dan Carpenter put it best in his review of the book - what is actually different about an analytic narrative if it doesn't go beyond the typical analysis, methods, and sources of traditional political science?"
3,No revelations at age 43,"A most notable quote about the Japanese, by a Japanese:""Of all the races of the world, the Japanese are perhaps physically the least attractive, with the exception of Pygmies and Hottentots. Members of the so-called Mongolian race to which Japanese belong, have flat expressionless faces, high cheek bones, and oblique eyes. Their figure is also far from being shapely with a disproportionately large head, an elongated trunk, and short, often bowed legs."" p26The rest of Kawasaki's book is not nearly as amusing; but some of it is still informative, 43 years after its first publication. A good editor might have helped the author organize it better, to avoid redundancies and contradictions within chapters.Worth a look, but there are newer and better accounts of modern Japan."
1,"Shoddy Construction, too large for kids, looks used upon arrival.","These wraps arrived looking like they've already been worn and stretched out. They are constructed VERY poorly, and not small enough for kids. The elastic is all worn out and the wraps appear ruffled because of it. I tried to return product to the seller but they were going to deduct me the cost of shipping, which is garbage. They want me to pay to look at a pair of worn out, cheaply made wraps? Not even going to bother sending them back - going to toss them in the garbage because that's what they are. DO NOT BUY THESE! I don't recommend buying from MMA One Stop Shop either, because they won't back their products for free. You'll get a crap product and pay to send it back, and the cost of shipping it to you will be deducted from the refund."
1,Shame...Shame....,É o tchan is one of the most hollow and silly artists who ever tried to be famous...The lyrics are so so stupid and the song melodies are the same...This crap went huge in Brazil by the middle 90's...It's really a shame...Unfortunately there's a lot of people who enjoys this kind of NO BRAINS NO ATTITUDE MUSIC...It's a shame!
1,BUYER BEWARE,"The second ingredient is; Soduim Laureth Sulfate. This chemical is used in car, floor and other cleaning products. It is highly irritating to skin and studies show high levels of skin penetration in heart, liver, brain and lung tissue, eye damage on animals (even when applied to areas not around the eyes). It strips skin of protective lipids and irritates and drys it out. It can react with other ingredients and create nitrate substances which are known carcinogens. It has no good properties and does not belong in skin products."
3,St Ives Body Wash,"This is a great body wash--good scent and great lather; however, for some reason it's no longer (at this time) available in stores. Buying it this way is far too expensive and there are alternatives. No reflection on Amazon as Amazon price beat most others."
2,This used to be great stuff,"They used to have the best-smelling body wash ever. Sadly, St. Ives has changed the scent for this body wash. The freshness is gone. Now it smells vile."
3,"Buen contenido, pésimo formato","El contenido filosófico y científico es muy bueno, pero la producción del DVD es pésima"
5,Humorous and humbling - Thank you Dr. Ledwith!,"Finally here is a scholar that provides a focused look at how our flat earth mentality trips us up and keeps us hidebound in outdated modes of thinking - with a fine humor I might add! As a scientist, I know the earth is round, but regardless of education we still carry the baggage of our culture which Dr Ledwith so clearly exposes for us to see in all its glory. Very thought provoking! I'm certainly looking forward to the rest of the volumes in the series....I hear the next one is about the real life of Jesus."
1,Very Poor,"I am sorry to say this is another poor version of what Dr Ledwith deems to be a series.......It's not a stab at Dr Ledwith, but an insult to Amazons customers,,,, these CD's are rubbish and if i could get my money back i would.....Take the reviews advice and dont even waste your money"
1,A rip off!,"I really looked forward to this cd - the trouble is only one song out of all 3 cds is original (it even says so in the fine print by the copyright info). The rest are all lounge lizard type bad imitations of the originals. What really frosts me is that the ad and the packaging claim ""performed by the original artists."" It's dishonest - both to the consumer and the artists that originally recorded these songs. I would not have given it one star except that is the minimum rating!"
1,very disappointing,"I awaited this CD set with great anticipation and I was shocked to discover that most of the songs were not the originally recorded ones. In fact, I have my doubts sure that they were even sung by the original artists. (although the CD covers state ""original artists"")I would love to know if others feel the same way."
2,Get a different book on natural dog training,"Don't buy this book unless you already have trained your dog, you understand what natural dog training is and you just want to read the original manifesto on ""natural dog training"". This is not a training guide, and it is not really a great introduction to natural dog training either. The author himself says in the introduction that he intends to ""write a new training book that will be explained in my new way of talking about behavior"". If that partial sentence makes no sense then the author also apologizes to the ""many readers who have struggled with my prose""You can find enough information on this theory, search for ""natural dog training"" on google. There is more information and great articles to get you started, including material by the author, Kevin Behan. But this book is not very helpful to a new dog owner."
1,Returned the book for a refund,"I received this book two days ago and am returning it for a refund today. This is the first time I've ever returned anything to Amazon. The author's prose is almost unreadable. The book is full of typos and non sequiturs. There wasn't what I expected... a detailed step by step program for training your dog. Instead there were ramblings about dogs' wolf ancestry, it's prey instincts/behaviors and other filler verbiage to compose a book that could be in my opinion much briefer. And at a price of almost $25 this added insult to injury."
1,This book makes no sense,"I have tried to read this book three times. It is really confusing to read and I cannot make sense of what points the author is trying to make regarding his 'theory' of canine behavior. I was really looking forward to his explanations and training tips as I really like the premise regarding prey drive and the importance of using it to work with a dog, but could not slog through the pages. Maybe I'll hang onto it and try again some day..."
3,Glean good information,"This book has a different perspective about dog training, one that is NOT generally in conflict with positive training and I am finding it valuable to glean from. Reading through would be quite a challenge (one I don't intend to tackle) as it is poorly written, edited, and formatted. That has been commented on many times; the current version is apparently no better than the first (I have the 2nd) but Kevin has ideas worth reading and utilizing. Every dog is different and some may need a truly personalized approach, combining several training methods. Kevin's are well worth knowing. Also check out Neil Sattin's site, [...]The Best Long Dog Leash for Training and Play - 50 Feet Long, 1 Inch Nylon, Visible, Durable, Strong, and Made in the USA"
1,"Bab, bad dog.","This barely qualifies as English. It often happens when someone is making up explanation, they make the language so inaccessible that it lends the air of expertise. The value of science lies in its testability, verifiable and ultimately falsifiable premises.What Behan lays out is a supernatural view of dogs, one where the reader is forced to take his proclamations as fact because there is no independent data to support his claims, nor is their anyway to test many of them. Of course there is plenty that is immediately and demonstrably false, and all it take is a little homework to prove these claims false.Frankly, this book could have used an editor, it is a bad, bad read."
3,Not what it is labeled.,"This was a Christmas present for my Mother who has been wearing this fragrance for many years. She always told me that the Parfum was the only one to get. This was labeled as Parfum but the Parfum never came in a spray so it must be a relabel or a knockoff so yes I am disappointed in the product I received for what I had to pay for it. I guess I wil have to investigate a product more before I purchase. Kind of thought that Amazon would not allow the sale of misrepresentations. Be wary, if this is a Parfum that you are familiar with, it is not the original one as sold by Cartier."
4,Jack goes back!,"This was a fun movie that Hallmark Entertainment put out for family TV. The graphics in the modern day ""giant land"" were excellent and the story takes a surprising twist as the movie goes on (although Jack's friend and advisor turned out to be somewhat predictable). Probably not a good choice for small kids, although my five year old enjoyed it. She has older brothers who watch Star Wars movies and others of that ilk, so this was probably pretty tame for her. The giant and a small amount of insinuated violence might be a little scary for some little ones, but others might do just fine. I give it a B+."
4,what might have been,"I found this to be a thourghly enjoyable movie of what couldpossably have been. The scenery in giantland was excellent,as was the creatures and all the special effects. The storywas well written and maintained throughout the film. Avisually satisfyimg film that deserved better ratings amdwriteups then it received at the time of it's release. I amvery pleased with this purchase, and I thought Mia Sarawas terrific as Ondine."
5,"Intriging, objective, facinatingly great twist.","I bought this movie, Jack and the Beanstalk - the real story, because I am a movie buff, especially for fantasy and make believe movies. This movie takes off with a facination of intrigue and wonderance of a story that has been told, read and remade over and over again, however, this time they got it right. I loved the good giants and subject characters and the moral of this story. For this millenium, this story is well worth the money investment, with great character portrayals and a great story line and plot, this movie will satisfy the not so interested movie goers, children and adults alike. Great cast and great story line. Thanks, I loved it."
5,Great for little hands,Great product; a perfect fit for children who have a hard time with full-size sticks.
4,Durable and Attractive,"Every bit as solid as their adult counterparts but painted to suit the taste of young players. At $3-$4, they're a great value!"
5,The Kids Love'em,"To be perfectly honestly, they're only 4, so I probably could've given them a pair of spoons and they would have had just as much fun. Still, they were affordable and seem to be well made."
2,Disappointed.,I think the tips are too small. The sticks should be as thick as an adult drumstick but shorter. I'm afraid these will make a hole in the drums.
4,They work,Bought these for my daughter to use on her new drum set. Thought that they would be a little easier to play with than the ones that came with the kit. They do their job well.
1,empty package,"I ordered this for my sons birthday, the package arrived empty. He did not get his drumsticks after I promised that he would. He was sad and I looked like a real bad"
5,great,"I ordered a set of drums for my son for Christmas. At checkout, Amazon suggested these sticks too. I've been happy to have 2 sets of sticks, these have held up nicer than the ones that came with the drums."
4,Good sticks!,My 5 and 3 year old son love these sticks. I worried that the blue paint would chip off but it has not and the stick are holding up well.
4,Good sticks for toddler/youth,"I ordered these on Amazon and they arrived in about a week, maybe a little less, which was great because my toddler was waiting for new sticks to arrive. When we got them I could tell the paint job was just a bit on the weak side only because they sort of stuck together for a second which effected the paint on the lettering. This initially gave me a bad feeling and wondered if these were going to be easily broken. It has been about 2 weeks and these sticks hold up great and I really do not see any issue at all with them. I think the price (around $5.75) is a fair price. I used to play drums and these sticks could easily be used by an adult also."
2,Not the best,"Yikes! What was I thinking when I ordered 12 cans of this stuff? The food pantry may be getting some.It tastes like.....well, I can't use the words I'd like to.Let's just say that it has no character at all...no distinct taste....if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee, I don't know if you'd even know it was coffee!I use just more than the amount suggessted;..;...doesn't help."
3,Not as good as the Organic version,"I was drinking Yuban Organic medium roast coffee until I could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so I tried this instead. What a let down after drinking the organic coffee. This just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to Folgers but the organic stuff, now that's a different story. That stuff is good. Tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at Dunn Bros or Caribou coffee houses. Don't believe me try both this and the organic version side by side. You won't go back to this again I promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all."

5,The Seminal Work in CSR,"Vogel's THE MARKET FOR VIRTUE is the seminal work in CSR. His lively text offers the right mix of theory, analysis, and example. His conclusions are profound and will make a difference for the better. Required reading for corporate executives, business and management students, and those of us who simply wish to be informed participants in 21st century society."
2,Tinny Sound,"Bought this based on reviews, looking for something to play both CDs and my ipod, sound w/ ipod is pretty good, but radio stations sound tinny, and cds not much better."
2,Horrible radio reception and sounds tinny,"I just purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my husband. I'm glad that I took the time to listen to it before wrapping it up. The radio does not receive channels clearly (we currently have a radio in this same spot that comes in quite well). Even after adjusting the bass, equalizer and surround sound, CDs sounded very tinny. I didn't bother with the iPod hookup since the sound quality of CDs was so poor. I would recommend this for someone who isn't too fussy about sound quality and doesn't use the radio often. It is a nice looking unit, especially with the blue lights on, and it has a lot of nice features."
4,Good deal for the price!,"I bought the unit for my teenage son, who like most teens lives for his music and Ipod. He likes it a lot and the sound is very good. It would have gotten a 5 star except it needs to control the Ipod more. It seems that some of the functions do not get controlled by the remote."
3,Adequate...,"This product is adequate, but not great, all around. The sound is acceptible, but could be much better. The bass is muffled and there is noticeable distortion at medium-high volumes. The remote is much too large and the buttons on the unit itself are cumbersome. There are no serious flaws with the unit, however.This was one of the only iPod-compatible units, which I was able to find, that have CD capability. If your requirements are to be iPod compatible and have a CD player, then this may be your only option."
1,Garbage,"I bought this product for it's sleek look and decent sound. So why 1 star? It broke 3 days after the warranty expired. All of a sudden the speakers stopped being able to play above a whisper. I have no idea what caused the problem. It was kept with other electronics in an entertainment center, was not damaged in any way and was never played above normal volume. So im out $100+ for a paperweight. Unless yours comes with a life time warranty avoid this piece of garbage."
4,Sounds great but limited iPod control features,"This system sounds great but buyers need to be aware that the remote only has limited iPod control features. The iPod controls are limited to: Play/Pause, Skip Forward, and Skip Back. Changing Artists, Albums, Playlists, etc still needs to be done on the iPod itself. This is a great system to have within arms reach."
2,For just a bit more,"Just want to pass on that I bought this Emerson product as a gift for my mom. It seems ""okay"". We hooked it all up and sounded fair for the price, but then we began our literal comparison. My daughter has a Klipsch I-Groove so we already knew it was INCREDIBLE but I thought it would be just fine to buy my mom the unit with the extra features instead of all the power...Don't do it! It's REALLY not worth the money you pay for it when you can spend just a bit more and get the POWER HOUSE I-GROOVE! I PROMISE you won't regret it. We ended up returning this Emerson and ordering my mom the I-Groove. And then my mom ended up buying me the Klipsch for Christmas too. All worked out great...so glad we made the return. Save yourself the hassle. Go check out the I-Groove!"
5,Great!!!,"Even though I was expecting for Robi's new music, and I must confess I felt a little sad when I found out that It only had some remixes and two new songs, because I have all of his previous cd's, I still love the cd, his music is sooo great that it has no boundaries, it's eternal, he is a missundestood artist, the world haven't heard him properly, so if you hear that he is a former menudo or that he wrote ""Livin' la vida loca"" or ""she bangs"" (which is true) don/t stick to that, because there's way more behind his cd's.His masterpice: Vagabundo (1996)"
1,Do not buy if you own any previous album,"The album has eight songs available on previous records (same version, same mix). It is a steal of your money. Only 2 songs are new and are not so good. It has 2 remixes (Cuando pasara and Bajo la piel) that are Ok.Please don't waste your money"
3,"Not her best, but still interesting","I've always liked this novel, though it isn't what I would call Murdoch's best. I found it to be much gentler than her other novels: there isn't any of the astounding weirdness of The Good Apprentice or The Severed Head: no incest, no murder, no wife-swapping.As a result, it is an interesting novel to read for the change of pace it offers in the body of her work. It offers perhaps a subtler take on repeated Murdochian themes of betrayl and alienation--artistic, intellectual, marital, sexual, and so forth.I have always wondered why A.S. Byatt chose to highlight The Sandcastle in her book about women's writing _Imagining Characters_; perhaps Byatt sees some of the same qualities in the story that I do."
2,"Beware formulaic, empty & tedious","My first Iris Murdoch, due to her reputation I expected quality literature,but dear me, it was like reading a mills & boon, such empty boring characters sooo predictable I hope her other books are better & that her reputation is deserved, but I shan't be finding out, there's plenty other fish in the sea. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for the portrayal of Upper Middle Class English Culture of the 50's YAWN..."
4,An Excellent Live Audio Document From A Great Band,"I picked up a used copy of this disc at a local record store. After listening to the opening track in the store which features a stream of conscious style rant about dogs by The Fall's only consistent member Mark E. Smith, I knew I had to have it. Brix Smith picks up lead guitar duty while Marica Schofield covers the keyboards on this set. I was familiar with Brix's contributions from her work on 'Perverted By Language' which up to the point I bought '...Oranj' was the only other Fall album I had heard. The band plays flawlessly, and Mark E. Smith is in especially fine form on 'Wrong Place Right Time', 'Friendz' and 'Dead Beat Descendant'. The glossy booklet included has some beautiful, color shots from the performance, but there are no video files as mentioned in the description."
2,Is this a counterfeit copy?,"I was excited to order the Walt Disney Treasures Davy Crockett complete televised series from Amazon. But the packaging is different than advertised and so I'm not sure if it's the real thing or a counterfeit copy. This series is advertised as a limited edition with only 150,000 copies issued and with the serial number stamped into the metal case. But I did not receive the metal case with stamped serial number as shown in the photos. Instead I received a standard double disc plastic dvd case with no indication that it is part of the limited edition issued by Disney. I have not played the dvd and will return it to Amazon so I cannot comment on the quality of the dvd itself. The printed paper liner for the dvd case and the printed books and ads inside the case look ""like new"" and maybe they are new. But I am not convinced that they are the genuine Disney product."
3,Not a bad DVD,"I bought this DVD as a Christmas present for my 4 year old son, anticipating the ""crockett craze"" that I went through as a child. However, that didn't happen. The commentary just isn't necessary. Disney just as easily could have made the commentary a special feature, rather than showing it at the beginning of each feature. My kids don't care much for it, they just want to see the film. I really enjoyed the DVD, hence 3 stars rather than 1 or 2. If you're older, enjoyed the Crockett series as a child and really want to see an excellent film to DVD transfer, buy this DVD."
5,Can't Go Wrong,"Absolutely loved it. Brought back so many wonderful memories of watching World of Disney with my own children. Now am re-living with my grandchildren. Even with all the modern special effects in TV, movies, and video games, they fell in love with Davy too."
5,I thought Davy Crockett was a legend,This movie is really good my favorite was when Davy and Russell were at the alamo. Good acting good for all the family.Disney did a good job on this. .Get this.
4,ROW,"although the frist one they sent was a mess, box bent,plastic torn, metal part did not know where that belong, glue everywhere,But when i called and spoke to a very nice customer service person she corrrected the merchadise right away, and it was sent in perfect condition in two days.Thank you for the best customer service I had in a long time. I should have got her name."
4,great for the price,only thing is the turf was bent and wouldn't get flat for months. but now is great. improved my short game.
3,Not the best putting mat.,"I bought this for my sister-in-law for Christmas. This putting mat has ""automatic"" return but the ramp is not that steep so, the ball does not always come all the way back. The green is made out of felt and keeps wanting to roll up even after being unrolled for several days."
3,Fun for the kids,"Not much use for adults, but keeps the little ones busy for hours. Quality isn't the best, but it makes a great toy for the kids."
4,exactly like nano,it looks exactly like nano. but it dosn't have touchable sensor. it has buttons. You need to charge more often. and you can charge the VPOD through computer's USB port or electronic pointer. i am happy with this purchase.
1,read it in Emily Carr's own words,"Read these instead: Emily Carr wrote several excellent books in which she describes her life in her own words. The most popular ones are: ""Growing Pains: An Autobiography"", ""Klee Wyck"" (which won the Governor General's Award for Non-Fiction), ""The Book of Small"" and ""The House of All Sorts"". Her writing is beautiful and simple, and she was an excellent writer in her own right -- so I was surprised to see that these books aren't mentioned in any of the other reviews.(I haven't read this book, but it was highly recommended to me, and I couldn't help responding to all the readers who were interested in Emily Carr but hated this book. From the reviews I read, I think Emily Carr would have hated this book too! A romance with a fur trader!?!)"
1,School obligation,"I had to read this book for school, but I would never have bothered to finish it otherwise. Most of the characters were not lovable or interesting, and there was no clear plot. The book never resolved at the end and you were left hanging. Perhaps the worst thing about the novel, in my opinion, was the way Emily never seemed to have any triumphs with her painting. I did NOT enjoy this book."
5,Learn Painlessly,"This book is as lush and verdant as the landscape where it takes place. Vreeland's fictionalized account of the life of Emily Carr feels spot-on for the characters, location and time frame. This book puts her up there and beyond other, better-known pioneering women artists and brings her to life in a way that feels real. Reading this makes you wish she were alive today so you could be her friend. I learned so much about Canada and the struggles of the indigenous people that Carr grew to love and wanted to preserve.I, personally, am not normally a ""gusher"" and certainly not a writer of reviews, but I'm throwing in my opinion on this one after such an amazing reading experience!"
4,The Passion of an Artist,"I loved this novel. Vreeland deftly conveys the artist's passion for her work in spite of all criticism. While telling the artist's story, she also tells of the story of a much wronged people, the Natives of the Northwest. The imagery used is wonderful and filled me with a longing to visit BC. She also explores the concepts of traditional Christianity and athe challenging larger view of God as believed by the Native peoples. It surely makes you think. She also was able to convey Emily Carr's passion to be an artist above all, and explores the artist's reasons for doing so. The book makes you think on many levels and sparks the creative juices."
2,The Forest Lover,I read this book for a class and can't imagine why it was chosen. I really had a hard time getting through it. I liked Vreeland's other books but what happened to this one? It did inspire me to go to the web and view Emily Carr's paintings. Can't recommend this.
4,Goin to Victoria,"I was so intrigued by this book that my family is planning our summer vacation in Victoria. I don't know what we'll find there, but I want to see Emily Carr's home, work, and maybe a totem pole or two. Although knowing how she felt about the totem poles, I'm sure I'll have a stab of regret at seeing them out of their natural environment. I enjoyed the book, but I don't know if my reading circle would be as enthralled as I was. I've kept it to myself because it touched me in a way that I don't think everyone would understand."
5,Fascinating,"Beautifully written book about a fascinating person. I had never heard of Emilie Carr until I read this book and was totally captivated by the story. My husband is currently reading it and can't seem to put it down.Ms. Vreeland is definitely on my ""recommended authors"" list."
4,Totemally awesome,"This engrossing book examines a largely ignored art and the people who make and worship them. I have seen some totem poles in various museums and like this novel, they feel alive. Great so stay with it."
5,The Forest Lover,"This book is a treasure. Every part of it was accurate. I felt as if it was wriien for ME. I cried, laughed, & had to stop every chapter & just sit & remember all similar things in my life. The love of the subjects that Susan wrote about really comes through. This is the best book I've read for some time."
5,Stunning and vivid,I couldn't get enough of this book. I wanted more and was sad when I finished reading it. I'm not even certain I would have liked Emily Carr if I had met her without knowing what I now know about her life and her work. The author did her work in this regard. Emily was obviously a difficult person to be around but it was this tenacity that made her accomplish all that she did. Many chapters were too short for me but that isn't a fault of the writer; just me wanting more. This book was extremely well written and I applaud the author for her extensive incorporation of artistic techniques and history! BRAVO!
3,This has not worked for one of our group,"We purchased 20 of these for our management team in case of power loss in our area. One of our management reported that their cigarette lighter has been burnt out because of this device. I have had no further reports from the management, either good or bad."
5,"It keeps me from getting ""sick"" after eating onions.","I don't use this product for the exact purpose it's made for. After I eat anything with ANY onions in it I get terrible stomach pains, etc. Using Beano I can stop worrying about invisible onions in foods. Obviously I still don't eat onions if they are visible, but this makes it possible for me to eat things like turkey dressing, soup, etc. that may have small pieces of onions in them and previously would have made me sick. If you have the same problem I would highly recommend you try this."
4,Nice Calender,"Just your standard calendar, but nice. A little spendy, but worth it for the true OC fan."
3,Decent rod and reel but line isn't the best,This rod and reel combo is nice for the beginner (like me). But I've found that the line you get has too much memory so it doesn't cast very well. I'm thinking of putting a higher quality line on it to have better results and longer casts. Anyone else experience this too?
3,Good Equip but i expected another presentation of the rod,"It's a good fishing equipment for beginners like me, plus it avoids buying everything separately, good reel, the rod has the offered technical features, good, it becomes easier to use, but it is not the published in the photograph, expected to receive the rod exactly as advertised, because one of the things I decided to buy it was the presentation of the rod."
