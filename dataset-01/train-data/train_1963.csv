3,Confused melodrama -star vehicle for dramatic Day.,"This one comes at you in pieces - you find out early on that Day's suspicions ARE true - her new husband is the jealous killer of her first husband - so that shoots the suspense for what looks like a half-baked remake of SUSPICION. Then comes the interesting part - Day runs for her life, stalked by husband Jordan. Police are powerless under laws not made for helpless women - interesting indictment of then society. Whole thing concludes with a silly ending - Day flying captainless plane to a safe landing after melodramatic shooting death of Jordan and captain in the cockpit. Odd script and unremarkable title song were Oscar nommed."
3,Surprisingly exciting.,"Doris Day did not do well at all in Hitchcock's Man Who Knew Too Much, so it comes as a surprise that she handles herself admirably well as Julie, the widowed flight attendant cursed with Louis Jourdan for a husband (that alone would be bad enough, except that he is also homicidally jealous). There is very little substance in the way of plot or deeper meaning in this movie, but for what it is, a predecessor of the stalker/slasher genre, it can be quite exciting. Although some below found the airplane finale a bit hokey, I was caught up and thrilled by it."
5,great fit,"This floor liner fits perfectly in the back floorboard of our 2009 Dodge Mega Cab. I used the Husky website to find the exact fit (item #) then searched for them on Amazon with that number. It's in the item description. I'd recommend doing this, as I ordered the wrong ones the first time."
5,2006 Dodge Ram 1500 Mega Cab,"This is a great product, a little expensive but I think it is worth every penny. Especially if you are from the north like me and have snow being dragged into your truck. Easy to install and clean. It looks great on the floor. You will not be disappointed at all."
1,Captain Kirk x 10,"The main character in this book is a Captain Kirk type except without interesting, intelligent co-stars. This guy can do everything on his own and he doesn't need anyone's help to do it. My issue is that following one guy who solves all the problems on his own gets old. And he isn't an especially engaging character. This book had promise, it HINTS at so much more. There ARE other characters but they never reach their potential and the interaction is bland. If he had a strong supporting cast this would be a fun romp."
2,Substandard space opera,"The book is mildly entertaining; the action moves briskly, maybe a little too briskly, and or or two of the characters are somewhat interesting. Unfortunately the main character is shallow, the entire setup is utterly unbelievable, and the complete lack of detail makes for a cartoonish environment.Compared to this novel, David Drake's RCN series with Lt. Leary, or David Weber's Honorverse are hard SF. The galaxy-spanning civilization is so poorly described that the reader needs a gargantuan amount of suspension of disbelief. There is not even a hint of the technology which is supposed to make it possible. Indeed, there is no feeling of what the technology can and cannot do; which makes it hard to understand why certain actions are supposed to be possible and others impossible."
2,Weak and Flat,"This is an extremely weak effort at the science fiction genre known as ""space opera"". The characters are flat and the plot is hackneyed at best. Best purchased at the used book store for half price if you are determined to read it."
2,Sci-Fi malware,"I finished Mr. Resnick's five Starship novels and I'm sorry I wasted my time. The series' plot stumbles from highly unlikely to increasingly unbelievable, and ultimately to absurd. The cast of poster board characters endlessly repeat the same few thoughts. The central figure, Captain Cole, spends more time going for snacks and napping than fighting the enemy. Mr. Resnick (in his preface) and through his protagonist continually avows his preference for thinking ahead vs. blindly rushing in, then finds his captain in the midst of battle having overlooked some obvious flaw in his plan. There are long tedious stretches of dialog with the format: bla, bla, bla, he said; bla, bla, bla, she said; etc.A vastly better example of this sort of space opera is Jack Campbell's Lost Fleet Series."
3,Warning you off only because the series had a disappointing conclusion.,I enjoyed this book and most of the series but feel Mr. Resnick got bored by his own storyline and characters by book 4 of 5. Book 5 ended with a Deux e machina that robbed the reader of a believable relevent conclusion. Alliances were far too convenient and character development was minimal. Add in way too many loose ends and it left me wondering why I started reading the series at all
1,Second worst book I've ever read.,"This is the second-worst book I've read in my entire life. It barely deserves the name -- from the paper-thin characters to the Deus Ex Machina plot elements, this poorly authored bit of garbage reads more like a narration of a third grade boy's daydreams than a published work."
3,Ends with a bang - but the ride till then is not so grand.,The story wasn't really believable - way to fast to really allow you to connect with the characters. It was more a set-up for the next book.
3,Its not awful but its not good either.,"The basic plot of the book and the characters have potential but in this 1st book of the series there isn't alot worth looking at or reading. Those people giving 4 or 5 stars probably haven't read any good SciFi (ie. Asher, Vinge, Cherryh, etc.)."
2,Kind of Bland,"The author starts off with a pretty good beginning, then he lost me: it just wasn't very realistic to me. Here is a synopsis of the story in three long sentences:The good guy has a discipline problem and despite being the most decorated military person ever, is banished to a nowhere post, and will be sentenced to life in prison for insubordination despite saving the day. Meanwhile, the evil first officer now captain literally kills a couple of million people by blowing up a planet and will only be demoted one grade in rank. In the end, our hero is rescued from a maximum security prison by literally walking out, where he then takes over his former space ship with a mutinous crew - all wrapping up the adventure by starting to repaint the ship as a modern day pirate ship where we can now milk out several more books.There is a lot of good science fiction out there to spend your money on - save your ten bucks on this book on something else."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"In the Navy, many morons surround me.Well, maybe not quite that bad, but the hero of the piece definitely thinks so at times.This is a military SF book, but it is closer in tone to Robert Asprin's Phule's Company than Hammer's Slammer's or David Webber's blow them away space navies.Much wisecracking, little introspection, in other words, as an officer who has used his brains and not the rulebook to solve military situations gets sent to the arse end of nowhere to serve with a crew of misfits on an old rustbucket, wherein he is reunited with an old sidekick.Cue hijinks and action and disobeying of orders. Pleasingly short and light entertainment.(call it 3.25)"
5,Fast moving SciFi,This here's a very entertaining and fast moving SciFi adventure story. Nice clean prose with snappy dialoge left me wanting more. This is the first book I've read by Mike Resnick and I'm sure to read more by him. Nice edition by Pyr Books and even enjoyed the appendixes. Highly Recommended.
2,Big time violent for kids,no benefit for children's learning. more violence than otherwise. these folks got to make it short and sweet rather than 2 hr. video long drawl.
3,Scooby,"This is okay- not 100% cotton, so although it needs no ironing, it is flimsy and not very soft. My child does not seem to mind. Also the baseball emblem in the left corner is very scratchy."
2,Okay... It isn't the Animals!,"I was very excited that SFA would be releasing their new album in May 2005. I had it marked on my calendar and pre-ordered on Amazon.It was my own fault that I never examined the album more carefully before my immediate purchase, but I realized the whole CD was just songs from other bands that *inspired* the SFAs.While I am still interested in knowing who and what are the influences of my favorite band, I still had my heart set on hearing their *own* songs, their *own* sound. Personally, I think none of these songs or bands can even compare to the Furries, who I've loved and fan-worshipped for the past few years. I don't crave the Super Furry *style*, but the Super Furries them*selves*.Do not buy this CD if you are looking for music from the band, it is a mere soundtrack compiled of other artists! However, listen to samples of the songs and if you like them, go for it. Just don't expect to hear the wonted croonings of Gruff Rhys!"
3,Ok for review,"I definately learned something from doing some of these problems, but I feel like it is only halfway converted from the old style of testing. Yes, they converted to the multiple choice answers, but still each problem built on the last. So, in that respect it was annoying. I found myself trying to look at the previous answer without seeing the answer for the next problem. If you want some good problems that are exactly like the exam, get the NCEES book. That is the best practice."
2,Didn't seem like enough problems per chapter,"I opened up this book a few weekends ago for the upcoming test. I was really disappointed in that there were only 2 or 3 questions per chapter! It did not seem like enough for such a LARGE & expensive book (500+ pp). I was also told by my colleages that the questions do not mirror what you will encounter during the PE exam, so I really don't know how useful it will be to go through the sample problems when they won't prepare you for the exam. I suppose that is why it is titled, ""Sample Problems"" and NOT ""Sample Exam Problems."" Skip this book and just get the ones geared towards giving you sample examination problems!"
2,Lost color,The red sheet bled very bad in the wash and came out a thin light red color. The original sheet before washing was a dark red thick sheet set. Would not get again and not using on bed since sheet is so thin now.
3,I got what i paid for,"the price is great on these. I wanted solid red and black sheets to match my husker themed toddler room. The sheets are nice and held up great in the washing machine. My only complaint was the softness or lack of. Them seemed stiff to me, but my toddler never complained. They where good for the value."
2,Don't Do It,"I got one of these because I'm a bit on the overly organized side, but didn't want to shell out the necessary cash for an electronic labeler. That was a mistake. While this item does work and produce labels, you have to crush your fingers squeezing the handle to get the letters to imprint clearly, and getting the label to actually cut itself from the tape is nearly impossible without just using a pair of scissors. On top of that, the label itself isn't very sticky, and falls off shortly after you attach it. I still own this, just in case I need to label something insubstantial, but for the most part, it's sitting in my toolbox, gathering dust.If you're considering this, get into your word processing program, type up some nice text labels, and affix them with tape. That will produce better results than this does."
5,Best little tent in the world,"This is a great product. The second time to use it, rain came in buckets. The tent remained absolutely dry. For the money, you will not beat this tent."
3,Mis-leading,"THIS IS NOT RE-FLEX...of the Re-flex of ""Politics Of Dancing"" fame. This is an electronic team out of Germany laying down an infective groove for you to lose yourself in. Although it is interesting how the sound builds up and takes you for a ride, like with most electronica 'Ubap' tends to become monotonous...monotonous...monotonous...monotonous...."
4,very resourceful...,a fun guide to Egyptian magic and mysteries. not the best and definitely not the worst... i have seen much worse. give this book a try!
2,don't bother...,"this book promised much, but it gave a little. texts were horrible, and the sample rites in the book were too ""new-age"" for my taste. this is ideal book for the kid or to be given as a present, and that's all."
1,Not worth buying,"I have what has been described (by my mother) as a bathroom sense of humor, so I thought I would enjoy this book. Instead, in the approximately 30 minutes it takes to read, I was rewarded with only one small chuckle. Around the campfire, well lubricated by consciousness changing substances, some of these stories could probably be a hit. On paper they are, well, boring and sophmoric. And don't think you'll be able to read them, then tell them to your friends around the campfire -- they won't translate in that sense. You're better off just making up your own stories. If you can imagine just one instance when a relatively small amount of feces ended up on your own or someone else's flesh, you already know everything this book has to offer."
2,Wordy,"I bought this book as bathroom reading humor and was very excited to have it for guests' amusement. However, I was terribly disappointed with the writer's style. It's simply too much detail and information.Every story is told in the same style - as if the author felt a need to drag out every page to the fullest; and sometimes that's just not necessary. A good story benefits from descriptive narrative, but it also suffers from being diluted with too many words.I will most likely sell my copy of this book."
3,Amusing in a childish way,"Scatological humour is fine in the right place and in small doses. Up Sh*t Creek meets neither criteria. The right place is in the men's room, or round a camp fire, where this type of story can be related first hand by the participants or witnesses. Small doses simply means that one or two stories are enough. Up Sh*t Creek attempts to bring together dozens of toilet jokes and, by doing so, is guilty of overkill - the stories lose their impact.Probably the best place for this book is in the room we all use but seldom discuss. There, the stories can be 'digested' little by little and might pass for a few chuckles. Don't expect anything too cerebral, don't buy the book if the discussion of bodily functions offends you, and don't lick your fingers as you turn the pages!"
3,Pretty good love story -- but a little long,"Sasha Seymour was barefoot and broke, saving all her money up to purchase a sheep station with her business partner Ashton York. Still broken hearted over being left by a past beau she carefully avoids a love situation with Ashton, until his kiss sets her body on fire.Ashton York, owner of a pub in Australia, finds Sasha Seymour and offers to help her out, in more ways than one. In love with her from the moment he laid his eyes on her he vows to make her forget all about the man that left her behind and just think about his embrace, his kiss, and his touch. Until, his past catches up with him.While I did find the pairing of Sasha and Ashton to be very sweet and romantic I think that the story was drug out. I believe it is worth it if you have the patience to read through a long book. I enjoyed the romance, the humor, and Ashton's dog Lightening! Although I stick mostly to Native American and Cowboy stories this was a good read, except for the 400+ pages."
4,Classic Flansy,Anyone who has listened to They Might Be Giants knows John Flansburgh's slightly eccentric and always fun musical style. This album is full of that same spirit. It's not an instant classic but rather an album that will get stuck in your head and that will pop into your stereo everyonce in a while when you come across it in your collection.
4,"""Mono Puff"" not ""TMBG""","Although Mono Puff is a take-off band of They Might Be Giants, don't expect the same TMBG here. The sounds go everywhere from 70s lounge music (which may not be a good thing) to country hip-hop. Overall it has a more mellow tone like night music with an odd twist. My only complant is the sound, although light in content, it is a bit too moody and doesn't have the charm of the TMBG duo. The CD is worth owning, but not worth 5 stars."
4,"Not only, by especially for, the ladies.","This was the second(last?) Mono Puff album, which was a side project by They Might Be Giants' John Flansburgh. The other members of Mono Puff this time around are Hal Cragin, Steve Calhoon, DJ***** (Spicy), Joe McGinty and Sister Puff. Many of the songs here would not sound out of place on a They Might Be Giants album, if they had slightly different arrangements. In many ways, Mono Puff sounds like a slightly ""funkier"" version of They Might Be Giants (with no John Linnell songs). This is a fun album that should appeal to most They Might Be Giants fans."
1,shoot me,"This cd is the epitomy of bad. I have seen TMBG countless times live. I appreciate their music and consider myself a fan but I can't find one morsel of goodness on this cd. It is torture to sit through any full track. Flansburgh's voice is irritating as hell and makes me want to put a bullet in my brain. It upsets me that this cd is even related to TMBG, quite embarrassing actually. DO NOT (I repeat) DO NOT waste your time or money."
2,A major disappointment,"It becomes quite obvious from this recording who is the creative genius of TMBG. It's John Linnell, full stop. This, on the other hand, is an awful-sounding bunch of demos, badly produced, with horridly superficial lyrics and featuring lots of disheartening funk bass onanism. I find it hard to believe a member of TMBG actually did this. Go get Linnell's wonderful (and intelligent!) State Songs instead of this uncommitted rubbish."
2,I wanted so badly for this to work...,"I can't say for sure that my experience was typical, but I can say that it was horrible.The short version is: I had to return it once for a screen failure, then I had to return the replacement for a screen failure (and a refund).In between the returns, I spent a significant amount of time on the phone with customer support. The manual was inadequate, especially for the wireless stuff. I also had problems with Windows (Network Bridging, I think) that further complicated things.For the brief time the two units worked, I was pleased. The picture quality was good, and once running, I had no problems with the software.I take a lot of digital photos. This would have been the perfect compliment.I gave the Memory Frame two stars (instead of one) because, in between failures and configuration problems, I was pleased with the quality of the display.Too bad I couldn't say the same about the quality control."
2,"Good specs, lousy performance, reliability","I bought this because it was a terrific buy for the specs. The first unit failed quickly and was replaced though I was out some shipping costs. Both unit used embedded Windows CE which was unreliable and tended to freeze when the menus were accessed.The WiFi link was also not reliable. It worked with some routers and not others. Entering WEP or WPA keys is a real chore with the on screen, non-touch keypad.The screen is bright, but suffers from some artifacts and flickers during redraws. It also repeats the same shots too often. That is, the random photo subroutine is poorly coded."
2,wifi reception horrible,"I could get the wifi working as advertised only after about three days of troubleshooting. I emailed customer support (ha!) and NEVER even received a reply.But the worst is that if you take the frame more than about 10 feet from your wireless router, there will be no signal and it won't work.I even have a signal booster on my router - enough so that my neighbors can see my network- but when I took this frame downstairs, no signal - no pictures wirelessly. It doesn't look like you can add an antenna which would look stupid anyway, but my advice is DON'T buy this thing if you want it to work wirelessly in another room in your house."
1,The one bad thing...,"The one truly bad thing about the Prism is its cradle. The PDA doesn't snap into the cradle securely like the Palm V snaps into its cradle. You sort of have to tilt and jiggle the unit a bit until the light comes on so that you know it's getting recharged. If you're not paying attention, you'll leave it there overnight and it won't get charged at all."
1,Can we rate this no stars?,"Yet another cheap attempt to make money off the Geisha name! Why is it that because geisha are Asian females and happen to be entertainers must they always end up associated with sex? If the authors of this blatant attempt to increase the audience for their shunga-philia really paid attention to Liza Dalby's book, Geisha (which they mined extensively for their Public Face section), they would have noted that training in the sexual arts has no place in world of real geisha! If they want to write about Japanese erotica, fine, but they shouldn't use it in a way to pander to Western fantasies that are patently false. It is a slap in the face to all true geisha who follow the road of artistic discipline and to the Japanese people whom they often represent. I'm sick of books like this!"
3,Great track crappy US remixs.,"Liek the other people. The orginal and transa mixs are the best. But yet we don't get the orginal one on here. We get 2 bad remixs [ atb and cj stone] The ratty mix is ok.Though the full length version [ not on this cd] is far better then all of these ones. Nice try, good to see a us release. maybe next time they can get it right.."
5,The funniest thing i've seen,"I was not a Pantera fan, actually i was forced into watching this video but it was the funniest video i have seen and now i own it, i watch it all the time, I love the songs (especially ""this Love"" and ""Walk"") i love Phil Anselmo, just buy this video, everyone from the hardcore Pantera fans to my Spice Girl worshiping friends love it!!!"
2,Please Read the Title,"Hey!I purchased these, under the impression I would receive Five of those cardboard boxes of the peeps all sealed together.No, The picture is correct you are actually only getting FIVE individual peeps on one small box for $5. Definitely- Not worth this price."
3,Fun Item,the chess set it on the small side but still creative and fun. Great for chess set or New Fans
5,Poignant and Profound,"I found this novel to be very poignant and profound. The writing style can be somewhat dry, along the same vein as Rizal's ""Noli,"" but for anyone interested in Philippine history and nationalism, as well as the lasting effects of past colonialism, this book is a must-read."
2,Yawn,"I just couldn't get interested in the subject of this book or any of the characters. Reading it was like swimming in molasses. Perhaps it was the foreign setting that turned me off. The language was unremarkable. Obviously, I did not find in this book what the other reviewers did."
2,"Pretty, but poor quality","These earings are very pretty. I actually bought them to wear for my wedding. When I first got them and tried them on, the metal making up the earring was so soft, the hook to go in the ear bent. It was really dissapointing. I guess I'll only be able to wear them that one day."
1,Horrible!!!,"If this was suppose to an accurate portrayal of social nudism, they failed miserably! The acting is pitiful (reminds me of high school drama club acting), the storyline is stupid beyond belief. It is a sad attempt of making a movie about making a movie about nudism, just a bunch of wanna-be's trying to make a name for themselves. Some footage in this movie was also used in Naked in the 21st Century, which is just as horrible as this. If you want a movie that has a honest, accurate portrayal of nudism keep looking becuase this is NOT it!!!"
1,don't waste your money,"I am a naturlist and thought the movie was very boring,to me it never made its point,what ever it was. Could not wait for it to end.Waste of time and money."
2,Not Worth [price],"I would title this ""Optical Networking for Crash Test Dummies."" It is positioned as a work for people with a technology background who need to ramp up on Optical Networking, but half the book is filled with ABSOLUTELY ELEMENTARY principles of networks. Much of the information is covered in more useful texts on network basics. The very meager portion of the book which actually discusses optical networks is too high level for just about anyone interested in this topic...."
4,Love's Old Country Music,This is a good CD. But there is 2 songs missing from this one. Those songs are: FOOL FOR YOUR LOVE and HERE COME'S THE HURT AGAIN. If these 2 were on here it would be a much better CD.
5,Saw him in Branson,I saw him in Branson on a family vacation in Aug 07 and loved his show. This CD is a great addition to my country music.
5,The greatest male recording artist of all times except for E,"Always liked Mickey Gilley, but after seeing his show in Branson, Mo I can't say enough about what a great show he puts on. My husband and I plan to return to Branson to see him again. Wish he would include Sweet Caroline on one of his albums after seeing him perform on stage singing this song, I would love to have the recording and I know many of his fans would as well."
2,not what i expected,"This book was a disappointment as i was expecting an autobiography.All this book is ,is the words and music charts of 26 of Barry's songs.There are 4 full page black and white photos of Barry which i consider the best part.The rest of the book is fine if you can play the piano."
5,Good Sound,My son likes these reeds the best for the Bari Sax. He has tried others but says these seem to last longer.
1,A Poor Film Deserves a Poor Soundtrack,"This soundtrack serves only one purpose. It backs up a mindless movie with mindless songs about mindless topics. I have not seen this film, however, I have seen ones exactly like it before. The only reason to purchase this soundtrack is for the Erick Sermon/Marvin Gaye collaboration, ""Music"". Or, if you are one of the sorry few still falling for Snoop Dogg's half-hearted productions, then maybe you will also be willing to fall victim to this pre-market tested production for a weak summer film and soundtrack. Peace."
4,the movie was the bomb but could the soundtrack be?,i tell you guys this is more to me of a hard rap album it is very good of course number one song deserves to be number one on the album snoop dogs song i love it but of course coming in close is erick sermons new one music i havent heard very much from him in a while i love it and of course if you want a good laugh listen to craig macks song wooden horse i dig it its got him and frank sinatra in it and last but least the doggy angels are using there voice in a fly way with a cool song shoot em up well ill catch ytou guys later go and get the album peace
5,Canon powershot cheap shot,Great deal on this adapter. Any time I can save by buying on Amazon I do without hessitation. Super deals and a great adapter for my camera. I beat the big online store by 60%.
4,Really good basic Instruction,"This was a good instructional video for group playing. They included a pamplet with the songs/words/and cords, sure made it easy for me. The group is very easy to play with and a lot of fun. I have enjoyed the video and I feel it has really helped my timing and self confidence."
2,Good idea poorly executed,"Sorry, but this DVD isn't any good at all. It was a good idea, but the audio quality is just too terrible to make it worthwhile. I can't play it loud enough on a TV to hear the other instruments above my own playing. My copy also jammed half-way thru -- an action which, while consistent with the title, is inconsistent with the goal.November 18, 2008 -- I addressed the poor audio quality by running the sound thru a home theater amplifier. It was kind of an expensive solution, but it successfully dealt with the problem. Since then I've practiced with the DVD many times and have found it pretty useful."
2,"Good idea, terribly executed","The step from closet picker to competent jammer is a big one, and this product should have been a great help. Unfortunately, the audio quality of the DVD is so terrible that it's almost useless. The producer did little more than stick a single microphone on the floor and hope for the best. I couldn't use the DVD at all with a conventional television setup. Ultimately, I had to hook up to a home theater that had Dolby capability in order to get anything useful at all. If they plan on doing more of these, and they should, then they really need to address the audio issue."
2,Poor quality finish,I bought this item about two years ago hoping it would spray lacquers. The finish quality was poor with the standard tip that came with the gun. I called the company and they called me back telling me I should thin the lacquer by 25%. I have used other spray guns (all with a compressor)and never had to thin the product I am using (at least not by as much as 25%). I have played with the controls and various amounts of thinner and have finally given up. It now sits in the corner of my shop as an expensive lesson - don't buy a tool unless you know someone who personally recommends it. I gave it two stars because the company called me back.
5,Fuji Q4 HVLP Sprayer,I received my Q4 neatly packed and exactly as the manufacturers described. I have used standard air spraying equipment before and I think I will never use it again. The Q4 was about the easiest to use high end piece of equipment I ever bought. Even the quide for obtaining proper viscosity was on the money. The spray pattern variations were perfect and the ability to adjust the volumn of paint prevented runs--all in all this thing works great. My first use was spraying a set of cabinets I built and I used latex with the #4 needle--that worked good. The only negative is for the price I think fuji should supply all the nozzles.
4,Overall.....impressive,Pluses:1. Quiet operation - it sounds like a small vacuum cleaner2. High quality parts - nothing cheap/flimsy here3. Great quality of finish - consistent quality with paint andlaquers.Minuses1. VERY stiff hose - it induces fatigue after a short while whichbecomes a bit of a distraction. I plan on changing mine soon2. Expensive - I got what I paid for so it's not truly acomplaintOverall I would give this product a 4.5 rating if I could. I'm very satisfied with this product
1,piece of junk,"Very disappointed I bought this thing. The thing is very battery-hungry. It can hardly last the whole day without being plugged in.And if you forget to plug it in at night, you're screwed. It won't last through the morning of the next day."
4,The best for this price...,"ok, so my old cd player was a sony and it broke quite easy. I wasn't so sure about sony again, but a friend recommened this player and I'm thankful now!! It has fantastic sound and is incredibly light. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a light-wieght player, which by the way is the best for sports, like working out because it never skips a beat. the only problem is the lousy headphones, but you can replace those easily with bettter ones, or I guess some people may prefer the 'bud' type. so all in all, this is a great little machine and I love it!"
2,Disappointed,"Although I love Cleo Laine's voice and the songs on this album, I was disappointed to hear that all were in the same slow tempo, resulting in a rather monotonous listening session."
5,luscious music......,"When you think of female jazz vocalists, what names come to mind? Often, you hear Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holliday, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. Well, add another name to the list--Cleo Laine. This beautiful, British songbird is phenomenally talented and I am surprised that we haven't heard more of her, and that her name isn't more well-recognized. Her lower register is flawless, sexy and carries the grace and the depth of the songs, featured here, with minimal accompaniment (just subtle chords from her pianist). Some of the best songs (in my opinion) include ""That Old Feeling"" and ""Ain't Misbehavin'"". The rest of the songs don't fail to disappoint either! Just beautiful."
5,old favorite,"I have had and used this marvelous book for years, and purchased another copy as a gift for friends who hunt. The source was prompt in delivery and the copy was in very good shape, as promised."
5,Superb electronica collection,"You'll love this eletronica collection from Norway's most prominent label ""Telle"". Including Röyksopp, Ralph Meyerz & the Jack Herren Band and old yet undiscovered anthems from Annie, Erot etc this album is mandatory in every self-respecting electronica fan's collection.The album brings disco, house, lounge and other subgenres together in a masterpiece collection with both party hits and sunday chill music. Intelligent music - yet still easy to reach for every electronica lover!Buy this album, you should already own Royksopp by now, and then check out Ugress and more from Ralph Meyerz and the Jack Herren Band and you will have discovered the top world of brilliant Norwegian electronica."
3,"My son loves it, but.....","I bought this costume for my 4 year old son. First of all, I am glad I didn't pay $60+ for it because it is not good quality and looks like something you can get for $10 or less at Wal-Mart. The package states size 4-6(small) and then says for ages 3-4. I think that age 5 to 6 is more correct. My son is 41"" tall and the outfit is at least 2 inches too long. The velcro patch that secures the cape has already fallen off after one day. It also comes with a voice box that has an unreplaceable battery. I would prefer that I could replace the battery since my son enjoys it so much. Despite my all complaints about it, all that matters is that my son loves it."
1,Deluxe is NOT deluxe,When I ordered this It is very misleading on the size and the accessories. When I ordered deluxe verses the regular one I was expecting the light sabor and the gloves..they did not come with it. Also my son is a size 6 slim and it said to order the medium..it is very very large. I doubt he will be unable to wear the mask because it falls off with the small velcro extra long strip that keeps coming off..perhaps if I tie it in a knot. Anyway..save your money and just go to the halloween store. Not worth it.
3,Very low quality for a very high price,"My son loves it. However, the quality is outrageously low, especially for such a high price. We did expect far better value for the money. Since the material is very thin, it will simply disintegrate very quickly. Too bad, as our son just wants to wear it all the time."
2,"Small, cheaply made and incomplete","We bought a medium for 9 year old. It is tiny!Made with a very cheap material, with weak stitches.Back is wide open (from waist up - only Velcro on top(and on the wrong side too)) so plan to buy larger so child can wear shirts underneath.Cape is not usable - one velcro and slides offDoesn't include breather box or booties or gloves."
1,Can't see out of the mask: horrible for children,"I received this today. The mask was out of the packaging and you can not see out of it. My child's eyes hurt after wearing it for one minute. Something was amiss with this. Said it was new, yet the package was open with the mask out of the packaging like they replaced the original mask with a terrible one."
4,"Good purchase, durable",My son loved his costume and used it all night long through multiple light saber battles with no rips or tears.
4,Fair quality for price,This costume worked its purpose for us. I just wish the face mask was better quality. It only covers the front of the face with an elastic strap that is supposed to secure it to the head - except that the mask is front heavy and slips off easily. My son was very happy and excited to get it!
4,Disapointed,"Was a little disapointed in the quality of outfit. The voice and breathing buttons looked worn. Size was okay, helmut was a little on the cheap side. Overall the outfit looked okay, had much higher expectations."
3,Smaller Than I thought,"I bought this costume for my son who is 3 1/2 yrs old. He is quite tall so that is why I got him the size 4-6, and I'm glad that I did. I put it on him over his closthes and it fit well. The legs are a bit tight over pants, which is good so they don't drag on the ground. Everything else is fine, not great quality but I didn't expect it to be. The mask is just a face mask with an elastic band that goes around the back of the head and has a velcro tab on the elastic which may or may not stay closed long term,"
4,Good costume for the price,"This was easy to put on, looked great, and stood up to the predictable sort of play. The helmet had dark red lenses that were impossible to see out of, tho. They distorted everything. I was tempted to replace them with lenses from an old pair of sunglasses but ran out of time, and the boy doesn't like wearing masks for very long anyway.Much better than the Princess Leia costume I got at the same time for only slightly less money."
2,less than hoped,"This costume is a lot cheaper looking than i thought. Almost looks like it was returned and resold. My 5 year old doesn't care so....nor do I. Glad it's only for one halloween, because i anticipate damage."
1,NOT DELUXE - Cape arrives in pieces!,"I ordered this costume for my son, he will love it, but only because I am going to make him a replacement cape - the one that arrived with the costume arrived in 2 pieces...2 long tattered strips attached to jumpsuit, and one short (waist length) cape to attach at the shoulders...I don't want to return it and risk getting the same thing again so I'm just going to make him a cape. Just a warning..."
2,Don't like too pre-made costumes,"I don't like costumes, that are 100% store-bought, but my 13 year old son loved it. It's kind of tricky to put on and the belt is way to wide, but overall ok."
3,Darth Vadar costume,My son has not been that interested in this costume. He told Santa he wanted it and then changed his mind.
3,EXCELENT,EXCELENT DARTH VADER COSTUME MY SON IS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS TOYI BUYED THE SABLE AND ALL OKTHANKS
2,Size did not match description,Small was way bigger than for 4-6 years. Cheap fabric. It arrived on the day beyond which you were not able to return it. Returned it anyway.
2,Disappointment,I am disappointed with this costume. It is described as being deluxe with the 3-D molded belt. The costume I received looks nothing like the picture advertised. The version I received looks a lot cheaper.
5,Meet heroes of modern history,"Mary Ellen Johnson is the founder and executive director of the Orphan Train Herigage Society of America. She's also known as ""the orphan train lady."" This volume is an excellent outgrowth of her interest in the 75-year orphan train era in American history. It is filled with accounts of orphan train riders, written by riders themselves or their descendants. The stories illustrate the wide range of riders' experiences. Some were orphans. Some were abandoned. Other children who rode orphan trains had parents who could not support them and gave them up hoping they'd have better lives. Some accounts describe finding loving families, while others were overworked or suffered abuse. Orphan train riders overcame incredible odds and emerged as heroes of modern history. Read this book to learn more about them."
4,A good book. Pleasant reading. Buffa tells a good story,"I am the Dutch translator of Buffa's DEFENSE and today I will start on THE PROSECUTION. Buffa tells a very good story in a very easy, relaxed style. I like it better than some other legal thrillers. My only problem with The Prosecution is that it consists in fact of two stories. In my opnion it would have been better to make the first one longer and use the second, where Alma Woolner is accused of murder, for a third book. But once again: good story. A reader who did enjoy THe defense won't be dissapointed by the sequel."
3,"A flawed, but interesting, legal thriller.","""The Defense,"" by the same author, was riveting, and ""The Prosecution"" has some of the same qualitites that made the former book so engrossing. Joe Antonelli is a fine protagonist and the book has sharp dialogue and a brisk pace. The problem is the last quarter of the book. The resolutions to the crimes are too convoluted and unrealistic. In an attempt to keep the reader off balance, the author throws in too many twists and turns. He is game playing, which does not make for good plotting. Buffa should have reduced some of the plot complications at the end, and he should have attempted to make the characters' motivations and actions more realistic. This book had the potential to be first rate, but it missed because of the over-the-top ending."
2,Could Be Better,"Mr Joseph Antonelli was a brilliant defense attorney who had never lost a case. He was persuaded to come out of his retirement to prosecute a deputy district attorney for hiring a someone to murder his wife. Joseph Antonelli had never once doubted his own ability to win once he took up a case, but that did not mean that truth and justice would always prevail.The book had proven to be disappointing. I struggled through the first half of the book. While there were brilliant sparks during the courtroom argument, those failed to lift the story which was otherwise shallow and unexciting. I also remained neutral towards the central character, Joseph Antonelli. The book was more a narration of the trial and failed to provide insight into his personality."
1,Very Disappointing,"I love mystery and court room drama. I did not like this book. I struggled through the first half, and I did not finish as I felt as if I were forcing myself to read. The story line seemed good and the characters often seemed promising, but the result was never delivered. The book seemed too slow paced due to the ""sage"" advice of another character to the main character, Antonelli. Why this was meandering from a side character was needed when Antonelli had been a lawyer for years, is beyond me. I would not pick up another book by this author again. My title says it all - very disappointing."
2,Glib practitioner,"I would guess that Mr Buffa had his plot flowchart well defined before he wrote that first word. Like Harlan Coban, his twists and surprises are ' clever ' and rarely disturbing. His attempts at giving the characters some depth is usually confined to describing how they sit, stand and stretch. Like Jefferson Parker, he has had to write two stories to fill the required number of pages."
3,SIZES RUN SMALL!,"My dog is a 16"" Beagle/Cattle dog mix -- 40lbs. She's a medium dog and the size chart puts her at a size Medium. But since she has a broad chest I bought her a Large. It should have been plenty big but instead it was too small to get her front legs through. My 16"" 40lb. dog wears an XL. Take this into account when getting one for your dog."
3,Normal,"It is a good book if you are interested in inventions and how they are involved in everday life, but it follows that formula that a lot of other books with the same topic"
4,excellnt book for the fall season,The Pumpkin Giant is a book that has been around for years but is hard to find. When I first found it after weeks of searching there was only one copy of the book in all of the Kent County Library system. It is about a far away kingodm terroized by the pumpkin giant who eats fat liitle boys and girls. The farmer and his chubby son save the community and the chubby little boy meets up with the king's chubby little daughter and they all live happily ever after. The pumpkin giant slayer becomes the king's grounds keeper and his wife who made pies out of the pumpkin giant's head becomes the head cook. The kingdom is no longer terrorized and all is joy. Very cute story!
2,Available Free,"Shortly after I purchased this item, it came to my attention that the same material was offered free on the publisher's website. It is the exact same solutions guide in a downloadable pdf form. I am not sure why they even publish this book if they give away the same content for free.Save yourself the money and look around the publisher's website."
1,"Rubbish;worth less, waste of time",This is a rubbish manual; not understandable;nothing explained; Just did the calculation like a donkey. If you have the book you don't need the garbage solution manual.it such a terrible manual ever I had.The author used this as a commercial purpose not for the student help.This type of author should have thrown in the prison for defrauding with students.[ASIN:053437123X Student Solutions Manual for Introduction to Statistical Methods and Data Analysis]
1,POOR EDITING,"I agree that this Telenovela was excellent, but the hack job that they did to the story leaves alot to be desired. It has become more a synopsis of the full story. So many wonderful scenes have been deleted which would not aid anyone in putting the story together if they did not watch it before. I am so disappointed at the editing job. This is a mere bad redition of such a great story. Release the full version it is the least that fans deserve!"
5,Simply Great!!!!,i got now around 20 telenovela DVDs from Amazon and i could say without doubt that this is the best!!the story is so sweet and it is all what you would want to see in a telenovelathe chemistry between the heroes is great along with the scenery of the hacienda and the horses.as for the editing i am surprise that people actually thought it poor as i thought it was great and i didn't feel i am lost at any pointi highly recommend this telenovela and wish you enjoy it as i did
5,Amor Eterno Entre Dos,Amo esta novela. Todos los actores hicieron un trabajo maravilloso. Deberian hacer novelas haci tan buenas. Es raro encontrar tanta quimica hoy en dia en novelas. Se la recomiendo a todos.
3,Boring!,I have a lot of telenovelas on DVD. I just love them. But Soy Tu Duena is very very boring. I love the actors and the story is not bad. But I was disappointed. The DVD and the shipping were wonderful though. Is very cut but you don't really miss anything important. And the shipping was fast.
3,Ok movie to watch,"I enjoyed watching the first parts of the movie,the plot is interesting.However,subtitles did not appear in sections of the movie which is very very annoying considering i do not speak or understand Spanish and to top it all,the movie has been labeled as having English subtitles. Was disappointing"
3,I love this soap opera / amo esta novela,"I got it for my mom because we both love Fernando Colunga, the video quality is good! but is too chopped off, lots of scenes are missing and is very hard to fallow the drama when you know that is missing half of it missing..... ( i know it does because we already seen it abt four times!)compre esta novela para mi mamá las dos amamos a Fernando Colunga, la calidad de video es buena pero esta muy recortada, falta media novela! y es dificil comprender cuando la mitad falta, ( y sabemos que falta tanto porq ya vimos la novela como 4 veces!)BTW KUDDOS FOR THE CAPTION IN ENGLISH!"
2,Bad Editing,"This telenovela is so beautiful, the actors, the music, everything! But the editing of this dvd is bad!I missed so much scenes that i loved ! For example one of mi favorite scenes was, when Valetina slaps Ivana and this scene is not on the dvd! I don't like the editing..but i love the Telenovela!"
5,Soy tu Duena DVD review,The price was great and it arrived ahead of schedule. I missed the early episodes and was able to catch up. This is a great way for my husband to learn to speak Spanish. I was very satisfied.
3,"Very cute, but thin on content","It's an adorable book, and would make a cute little gift for someone you like cuddling with. It's very nicely laid out and the paper, printing, and binding are attractive. Yet I can't help but feel that it contains very little actual content. It seems like more of a gift item than something to buy for yourself."
3,"Short, and rather obvious.","This book was shorter then i had figured it would be. Read it in less then 20mins. Not very insightful. Its pretty good, but its not worth the money. The book physically feels well made, good paper, nice cover, but that would explain the price. Nothing else in this book is worth the money. Good for couples looking for basic information but hardly useful for anyone knowing anything on the subject or for someone who knows what they want. The only part of the book that was useful is how they described what the term ""spooning"" means... I felt a little ""talked down to"", didnt like the tone of the book. I Wish i could rate it better but, It was barely useful and hardly worth the price to me. Luckily its less then $9... If you have the money to waste... or a gift certificate with only a few bucks on it. Go for it. But if your looking for anything on the topic short of a definition, this isnt it.I think all $9 of the cost went in to paper and binding."
1,Not worth it.,"The book may be cute but I was truly expecting something with a little more content. It isn't worth the money you'll spend on it. Trust me, you know everything that is in this book already and you won't be missing anything. I was very disappointed."
3,Works ok but too expensive,This worked really well in making my hair soft and saw a little difference in the dryness of my hair but didn't see any difference in how much my hair would break and still saw the same amount of hair on the bathroom floor. Little too pricy for me and not enough results.
1,Nasty product!,"I ordered this hoping I'll get the product in the picture. Instead, I received the 1-2 erosion level, green strip conditioner, which I can find for half the price anywhere else. The product is terrible, weighs down your hair and makes it look dirty. I returned the product and paid $12 shipping. The seller would not give me free return even though it's a different product than the one pictured. Stay away from this seller and from Kerastase!"
1,Definitely not the Kerastase I know,I had been using Kerastase for almost a year and I received this product only to find it was DEFINITELY not the conditioner I was used to. It was thin and runny and did not condition my hair whatsoever. It seemed more like sunscreen than a hair product. It didn't even smell the same. I'm convinced this was NOT the real thing.
3,Good but expensive,"I was recommended to use this product because I have highlighted treated hair with some damage/dry, by my hair stylist. I have been using this product for a couple of months, paying a lot of money for it. My hair is very hard to manage, thich and very wavy/fuzzy. I thought this product would smooth it. It is a good product, it didn't make it as smooth as when I go to the salon. I wish the price was half of what it is."
1,they changed the formula :(,"This was my favorite conditioner by Kerastase for years!!! I have a lot of fine, highlighted, hair and this was perfect for detangling and offering just enough conditioning without weighing my hair down. This new formula is very heavy and weighs my hair down without the detangling properties. YUK!!!!"
4,It Works,"This product actually does make my one-process-bleach hair look much better. I don't rinse it out, but the product is well absorbed and does not weigh my hair down or make it look dirty."
3,Too thin,"I ordered this by mistake and would not recommend. It's so thin it runs out of the container without squeezing, like it was watered down."
3,Average Conditioner,This is a great conditioner to put on your hair after you've deep conditioned. If you use alone you won't receive anticipated results from this conditioner alone. I've used this strictly on the ends of my hair on the day I've had it colored. Seemed to seal in the color and left my hair really healthy after coloring.
3,Kerastase Resistance Ciment,"This product makes your hair soft, but I didn't notice it helping with my hair breakage. After using this product and being discouraged, especially because of the price, and it not work as well as I thought it would, I came across PRO-V RESTORATIVES BREAKAGE DEFENSE CONDITIONER and thought I'd give it a try. For around $5.99 this stuff is WONDERFUL. I wish I had found this product before spending around $35.00 for Kerastase Resistance Ciment Anti-Usure."
2,Product Has Changed Dramatically !,"While the service, packaging, delivery and seller are all impeccable, the product is no longer the same. ;-((. I have been an avid user of this conditioner. The old formula was MILES better. It is now MUCH more watered down, has a completely different consistency, color, and odor, and the way my hair reacts to this new formula is not they way it did before. Now, it really over coats my hair making it limp and greasy looking. YUCK. (Only use a dime sized amount too!)I have read other reviews about loyal, disappointed customers of KERASTASE speaking of this new formula and how bad it is now. It is too bad. I now think this is an over priced, drug store type of product.In closing, this is NOT the sellers fault. I have ordered this a few times and the formula (new) is the same every time I purchase this new formula. Disappointing as described.Sorry, over-priced, Kerastase, you have lost a customer."
2,Not as I expected,"I heard a great deal about these products and I was expecting more. I have fine hair and it makes my hair shinier, but it drys it out and I don't think it improves the quality."
1,not happy with product,"I was not happy with this purchase. I have purchased this conditioner many times from the salon I go to and the one I ordered on Amazon was not the same. Was not happy with it at all and was not offered a refund. Instead I was told the stuff from the salon was probably out dated, ya right."
5,A great gift for all ages,"I sent this to my cousin, who lives 700 miles away. She loved it. She informed me that she already uses it for her 2 year old and had planned to use it for the baby. She said that it puts her daughter right to sleep and that her daughter loved carrying the tote bag around. She had made it into a make shift purse and was putting all her toys in it. My cousin and her daughter both have sensitive skin, but have no problems with this product. Its a great product for all ages!"
5,"We love it! Great fragrance, great variety, great product","The products smells wonderful...We have most of the lavender fragranced products; Johnson's, Gerber and Baby Magic. Baby Magic has the most pleasant smell for ""baby"". You get better variety with the choice of either foam or gel; and the lotion is a great consistency. The CD that comes with is AWESOME! It's a great calming collection of songs. The gift pack is a GREAT gift idea."
1,contains parabens,"I got this as a gift and thought it was great, until I read the ingredients. This product contains parabens, which has hormone mimicking properties and definitely not recommended in baby products. There are lots of baby safe products, so I would suggest reading the labels before buying a product."
1,miss represented image,This product was advertised as having a hand strap which is why I purchased it. It does not have a hand strap it has a wrist strap. Two very different things.
3,Good but a slight problem,"I heard a bunch of good reviews for this CD player. But When I got mine I found out that the head phones arn't all that great, so I bought new ones. That didn't really bother me much. The reason I got this CD player was because it was suppose to be rugged and tuff for I could bike or jog with it. Well one day I rode my bike 1 or 2 miles and when I stoped to take a break I turned my CD player off and when I turned it back on the volume woulden't adjust right. It said it was on 10 but it sounded like like it was on 5. Then I turned it to 0 but is still sounded like 5. So I sadly had to return mine. But it does have many different features just it's not as loud as some CD players but still very close. So basically if you want to buy a strong durable CD player that you can jog or bike with I recomend you don't get this one."
1,Here we go again....,"Totally disappointed. The episodes are nothing more than exact copies from the Genius Products DVD boxset release of 2008. No remastering to correct the 4% error in speed and pitch. No insert of any kind. Just the DVD inside. And the packaging is misleading... it says there are 10 episodes. There are not. There are only 5 episodes. Each episode has 2 segments, making for 10 segments. But they are still only 5 episodes with a total running time of approx 101 minutes.Final comment... if you already have the Genius Products complete series boxset from 2008, you DO NOT need this as no improvements were made."
5,I learned to cook from this book!,This is a great cookbook. I learned to cook from it as a kid. The blueberry muffins on page 145 are the best!
2,Taste of Oregon,The Taste of Oregon book that I bought was advertised as a hardcover recipe book. When I received the book it was not hard cover but a paper cover. I feel the seller was not honest in their write up. I should have known the price was too good to be true.
3,Cute animals,"Cards are thick and sturdy,but it has a paper playing mat.The animals are cute and are real live animals."
5,Excellent movie!,"Sacred Earth is the most moving and relaxing movie I have ever seen! If you enjoy watching beautiful places with no signs of human interference, this is the movie for you! Nothing but the wilds of Arizona with soothing music in the background and occasional soothing, insightful, thoughtful words by the hauntingly unusual voice of Linda Hunt.I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who needs to relax with the aid of soothing music and beautiful, unadulterated natural scenery."
4,Sacred Earth,This is just beautiful and very Zen. Makes you want to find these places and spend some discovery time there.
3,Wish it had the chords,"When I bought this item I assumed it had the chords written with the piano/vocal score as many others do. My son plays the piano but he reads the chords when he plays. So, I ended up returning it. So, if you don't need the chords I suppose it will be fine for you!"
4,A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,This book was very enjoyable. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a light hearted book to read that is not to difficult. This book makes you think of what could happen in your everyday life. I think everyone should read this book.
4,Very well done!,"When i first got the movie for a present i thought it would would be babyish. But when i first saw it i thought it was very well done. It has great new ideas of how to make learning the alphabet in a little more than no time. Whoever Shaib Al-barzinji is, i'd say he did a pretty good job. The reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because of the last song. I'd give that one a 3 stars. But everything else is great!!!"
3,Not enough Arabic - a bit corny,"I was hoping that this video would be a good way to expose my then 1-year-old daughter to Arabic while she was not in Egypt. Unfortunately, there is as much (or even more) English in this video than Arabic. I suppose this criticism might be seen as unfair, given that this video is for discovering the alphabet, not the entire language. But as a language teacher I think that it is far more useful to use the target language as much as possible, and the native language as little as possible.Apart from the methodological criticism, I found that this video was on the corny side and not very visually interesting. My daughter NEVER asks for this video, and I can't get her to watch the whole thing even though I try to make it exciting by singing along and dancing, etc. And I've been trying for over a year!Overall I found that the video didn't meet my needs, but I suppose for older kids who haven't had any exposure to Arabic this might be a good first video."
3,Great reference book,"I read The Secrets of High Magic at a transition point in my craft-workings, and found it to be a very useful tool as a reference, but lacking sort-of in soul. I did enjoy the chapters on Alchemy and Talismans, being a do it yourself type, I can appreciate what it means to produce your own magical solutions and tools. Although it's a little more involved than your led to believe, I had great results using the instructions found within. Personally I have gravitated more towards a Druid-Holistic-Holigraphic approach to Witchcraft, and so couldn't appreciate the Angelic/Christian aspects the book shows of this type of magic. And I agree with Avril, it IS very ANNOYING when you CAPITALIZE every other WORD in a SENTENCE, as was done so often with this book.Durk Simmonsauthor Strings of Connection :Book One of the Witches in America Series"
3,Just a litte taste---,"Whew! There's a lot of info in this cute book. If you want a quick overview of the magical arts then this is the book for you. Topics such as alchemy, the planets, kabbalah, tattwas, talismans, the elements, the greater and lesser pentagram rituals, and even a basic description of vajrayana buddhism is included. . .plus a lot more.This is in no way a detailed magical primer. . .i don't think it was meant to be. This book works well as a quick reference if you want to check a particular fact.This book immediately grabs your attention with the lovely binding, nice quality paper, and eye pleasing graphics. As you read the pages,you may wonder what it is like to open your awareness and consider what you can accomplish when you regognize that divine spark within, and use that power to help yourself and others. Isn't that the point anyway?"
1,Even the title is a copy of another book,"This is a complete rip-off of Francis King and Stephen Skinner's classic book on magic, ""Techniques of High Magic"". It covers almost exactly the same ground, and the title is only one word different. In fact the only real difference is the very strange typesetting of the Francis Melville book, and the artsy layout. I suggest you buy the book it was copied from instead."
1,WHAT A JIPP!!!!,"When this item was listed it was listed with metal tools and the description did not indicated that it was different from the items that it was posted with. First of all the item was not in stock so I had to wait and to my horrid disbelief, I opened the box and find a plastic tool!!! I paid almost $15.00 for this crap! Never ever again."
3,Does not work on all lock nuts,"Bought this to tighten a sink strainer lock nut. Description says it works on lock nuts of ""any size."" This is not quite true as I couldn't get it to fit the strainer lock nut on our kitchen sink (very large, about 5 inches with small ridges--was installed by a plumber who obviously couldn't tighten it properly either or my sink wouldn't have leaked all over the cabinet). It does work well on other lock nuts, including pvc type as long as the nuts have the large ridges for it to catch on. Don't know why our strainer lock nut is difficult to tighten. Finally got it tightened with another wrench and some maneuvering. I kept this item was it wasn't worth the shipping to return it."
2,OK. not nearly as absorbant as,"Compared to a 7 year old ""Absorber"" that is in tatters, this thing does not wick nearly as much liquid. Must ring out more often to get the same results."
3,Not a Car Charger,"It should be noted that this travel charger is for plugging into an AC wall outlet, and not for use in an automobiles DC cigarette lighter."
3,It's good on the GO,"This is great for the Visor, since it doesn't operate on the battery replacement. One bad thing about this is the cord is too short!"
3,Primal Rythmn,"His small voice and powerfully rythmic sound reminds one of a pocket protector nerd who has stepped out from behind Windows to express his sexual frustration with acoustic guitars, conga, cymbals, Turkish drums, trombone, trumpet and more. For someone who wants to hear something powerfully different and doesn't mind a little noise."
1,Stopped locking after a week,Sturdy knife but now unsafe. Stopped locking after a week of use. Trying a Buck brand next. Blade is decent but for the $$ I was disappointed.
1,Stainless Steel? Yeah right.,"I used this knife for 3 weeks and within that time the locking mechanism rusted so that its unusable. I had one of these knives made in Japan that I bought 20 years ago and that was a nice knife. This one is made in China very cheaply and will not last. Sorry Amazon, its going back."
1,"So, so...expected a little more more","Dissappointed with the quality but kept anyway, would not been worth sending back for the shipping cost I would have lost. Rug thinner, lighter in weight and didn't have the fullness I expected. I know it was only $20 but K mart and Walmart have some better quality than this at that price. Sorry, wouldn't recommend."
1,What a load of Pfhuuuffff.,"The notion of a more rational Hitler, making the correct decisions is fine. The problem with this book is the glorification of the ""wise and gentle"" Fuhrer."
2,Interesting Story,"The concept is fascinating and the story moves along quickly. What bothers me is that there is at least one typo/syntax error on every page. May times it can change the meaning on the sentence: Writing ""Did"" instead of ""did not"". This reads like it was self-published with the author fogetting about spell-check and grammer check."
1,The Lion is Humbled,"Badly written, even more poorly proofed. A book which makes Churchill and Roosevelt the villains and Hitler the rational, kindly ruler of a benevolent Third Reich. The sub-title states that this is book one of the thousand year Reich. I hope not."
4,"The Lion is Humbled, but needs a spell checker and a proof reader","I'll admit I liked this book. The story was good and it was a fun read. However, Blumetti needs to have someone proof read his books for spelling errors. It's irritating and interrupts the flow of the story. I'm looking forward to the sequal but I hope he corrects these mistakes."
3,More variations for those who love their ABMs,"This is not my favorite of the Nitty Gritty series, but I love having a huge selection of ABM recipes. I would rate Rehberg's ""Bread Machine Magic"" books as superior, in general, but ""The Bread Machine Cookbook III"" gave me a delicious ""Cranberry Orange Bread,"", page 76, ""Anadama Bread"", page 42, ""Jalapeno Corn Bread"", page 45, ""Orange Ginger Bread"", page 84, ""Chocolate Chocolate Chip Bread"", page 101, and ""Poulsbo Bread"", page 131.For those who want an ABM recipe for every possible inspiration, they'll need this volume!"
5,Really Works,"I use this primarily when it gets warm and bugs and insects are rampant. Mosquitos love me. However, they and their insect buddies don't love tea tree oil. Since I don't like using oily products such as insect repellent, this product seems heaven sent. I also use Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner and combined with the soap it is a triple threat against unwanted bites and irritations.Tea tree oil has a somewhat astringent quality and scent which isn't unpleasant and is actually sort of fresh without having a flowery property. It is also good for facial outbreaks as it affectively fights oily residue on skin.My only gripe with this soap is its price. This soap dissolves quickly and at its price point it isn't really much of a deal."
3,Didn't tingle,I expected the same invigorating tingle that comes from the teat tree shampoo. But it never happened. I was disappointed
4,Yum yum tea.,"This stuff is epic. After you wash this stuff all over you...it leaves this awesome tingly feeling of freshness surrounding your body. Plus...haven't tried it, but it says you can use it to shave...but I haven't attempted it. Just wish the shipping wasn't so expensive. Otherwise...I'd be buying this stuff for every bar of soap I use."
2,Not great,"I ordered this soap and expected it to be very good. The scent is nice, but that's pretty much all that sticks out. No visible change in my skin at all. It also seems hard to get it to lather. I felt like I had to use quite a bit for that. I'm trying something else. Will not order again."
3,Very refreshing but not worth its price.,"I've been looking for a tea tree oil bar soap and decided to give this a try since I found it on sale.Pros:I love the peppermint smell that lingers in the shower.It is very refreshing and hydrating.It helps controlling sweat odor (like armpits and feet)Cons:It did not control the oiliness on my chest, back and neck.It is irritating for the eyesToo expensive for everyday useDon't plan on buying it again, since it is nothing special. Will keep using it for specific regions and will add tea tree oil to my favorite body wash."
2,Tea tree soap,"Smells really minty, strong smell but I like it, definitely stick with you, overall not that bad, as opposed to most tea tree products"
5,The single best book about Tarantino,"This book is a must-read for every true Tarantino fan.Jamie Bernard's book is simply amazing. It covers Tarantino's life from childhood till about 1996. The book is well-written, and goes deep into detail and uncovers Tarantino's life as hyperactive kid, movie theater regular, fatherless child and genius moviemaker. This is the single best book ever written about Quentin Tarantino. No other book delivers such great information, biographical facts and stories about the making of his early movies and involvements in projects. If you want to read a good book about Tarantino, get this one first. It's the best!trust me on this..."
4,A great scoop on Tarantino's beginnings,"I just finished reading this book, and it is a fine work of reporting. It interviews people from both sides of the Tarantino debate (those who love him and those who hate him), and allows you to draw your own conclusions from all the statements. It covers Tarantino's life from his birth up to the moment when he made Four Rooms.Too bad this book is out of print. I hope there will be a reissue in the future, probably covering the latest works of Tarantino."
2,"OK, but large and not stable","Bought this for something that is quick to deploy on walks, hoping that it would still give tripod results. As a monopod it is fine, and my camera (a Canon SLR) snaps onto the magnetic mount very securely and instantly so that is good. The height is also quick to adjust, also good. One problem for those people wishing to travel is the size- this just doesnt collapse like most monopods, the shortest size reaches to my chest and I am 5'11''. This makes it impossible to do anything with but carry in your hand, and even then it is larger and more conspicuous than you would like something like a walking stick to be. You can unscrew the legs and completely disassemble it, and then it just about fits in a suitcase for travel. Finally, it is not good as a tripod, it flexes and when the camera is positioned to portrait my camera rotates in the magnetic mount under the off-centre weight of the lens."
2,Simply Scandalous,"I Enjoy reading Carly Phillips romance books. Especially the Chandler Brothers in the ""Bachelor series"". Prepare for spicy love scenes but, ""Simply Scandalous"" repeated Would or, Wouldn't she, a few too many times for me! Sorry Carly!"
2,Something Missing,"I bought the three books of this trilogy all at one time. I'm sorry, but I wish that I had read at least one before I bought all of them. I could hardly read through parts of these books because they were so trite.There were passages where Carly Phillips really grabbed my attention with her style. But the plots were just so boring. Also there were more sexual passages than I felt it needed. I felt it almost concentrated more on the sexual passages(for frustrated housewives?) rather than using the sex scenes to enhance the romance.I don't know. Maybe it is just me. This was the kind of book I probably could have enjoyed in maybe my very early 20's.If you are a mature woman (over 35) who has any semblance of depth - pass on this trio."
4,Very Good,"I have not read the previous book, but it didn't matter. This book stands on it's own just fine. Cat and Logan make a wonderful 'Cinderella and Prince Charming'. The best part is, Cinderella is not the only one to have her dreams come true. Logan is his own man and very strong, but also lonely. These two have more in common than they realize. Also, Emma is a hoot! Everyone should have such a loving, meddling grandmother. Very enjoyable. KCS"
5,Excellent for shiny like new jewelry,Gemcare's Radience 2000 is by far the best precious metal cleaner and polish I have come across. I am the jeweler for a charity thrift store and we get a lot of silver and some gold jewelry as well. Most of it is tarnished and needs cleaning. This product makes most of the pieces shine like new. I also use it on some of the better costume jewelry. Definitely helps to sell our merchandise.
1,Can't view on iPad,"Would live to have been able to review, however AFTER I paid for this and downloaded amazon instant video viewer it tells me I need Adobe Flash, which is not supported by Apple. Hope I get a refund for this. :("
5,Stunning resource for anyone who loves kids!,"When I first saw this book, I was expecting a list and not much more. But the depth and research that went in to this book is extraordinary! Anita Silvey even knew most of the authors and illustrators for these books personally - you can't get much closer to the sources than that! A delight to read, and full of insightful, delightful historical information and personalized anecdotes, this book would be a perfect addition to anyone's bookshelf, no matter what age!"
5,if you love children's books........,"This book operates on many levels, in ways that I had not initially expected. Althought not a parent, I dearly love to buy books as presents for the various children in my life. Thus I bought this book to help me find suitable books to give for Christmas, birthdays, etc. The minute I started to read this book(which is full of charming anecdotes and history about the writing and illustrating of many childhood favorites, as well as about a number of more contemporary books with which I was not familiar), I realized what a wonderful resource it would be for new parents. I have now given it to 3 friends/family members with children, as well as to another friend who is halfway through writing and illustrating her first children's book. Finally, as an aging ""baby boomer"" myself, I can enjoy reading it to wax nostalgic over my own favorite childhood books. All in all, a very satisfying book, for a variety of reasons. Enjoy it!"
2,"Okay, not very creative or interesting choices","This list is pretty standard, I think a trip to the chinaberry catalog or website would provide much better suggestions. Many of the stories included are classic. The author included a good amount of text describing each of the stories suggested. But in the last few years some amazing children's stories have been written that I think are much better, especially for the younger crowd in the board book and picture book category. We have an amazing collection of children's literature, but as I am always looking for more, I took this book out of the library and I was very disappointed. In our collection of thousands of books for my children, we have 15 of the suggested titles. My suggestion, go to chinaberry on the web and go from there."
2,Not a Bad Resource If You Know About Children's Books,"Silvey's book gives lots of wonderful books, lots and lots of books, but little concept of why (on an objective standard) she chose these books. For example why choose Roald Dahl's BFG rather than his more renowned CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY? Why did she exclude WHOSE MOUSE AM I, the MISS PICKERELL books, ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN? Where are the Scott Corbett, Bruce Coville, and Jay Williams classics? How can one compile a ""Best"" list of children's books without HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS or any Judy Blume book? Very few books on her list come from African-American (bell hooks, Irene Smalls), Asian American (Taro Yashima), or Latino American (Harriet Rohmer) authors.Hopefully when she updates this book she will make it more multi-cultural, historically respectful, and more objectively evaluated. Should you buy it? Absolutely! It possesses some EXCELLENT books, but you should not make it your only book of this type."
4,Very Helpful!,"People who are familiar with the Bible know the constant tension between the cultures in the Bible lands and our own, that time and our own. These differences can make it difficult not only to understand what is being taught by the Bible, but more importantly--why it matters. Jud does a great job of bridge-building between that world and this one. This book takes timeless teachings from a teacher much wiser than Jud, and offers them to you with practical, timely insights about our search for fulfillment. I have found it helpful personally, and for leading discussions on the topic."
1,Riddled with Inaccuracies,"I considered this text as a possible supplement to the texts used to teach my college-level American literature class. But then I actually *read* it. I was horrified at the inaccuracies, especially the information about slavery, ""mammies,"" slave childhood, and education. In the ""Children of Slavery"" section, there was only one footnote, which led to a statement about Islamic law--entirely without context or source. There were no other sources identified for the blatantly inaccurate information.The book should be pulled from publication so the authors can do some research. In the meantime, the beauty of the cover shouldn't fool history-seekers: There are real works of scholarship out there. This book isn't one of them."
3,About MacLean Stevenson,The book makes a mistake about Mr. Stevenson (Blake on MASH). The book says MS left MASH and in no time was on hello Larry. Excuse me! Hello Larry began about four years after MS left MASH.
2,Not so great.,"These are really cute, but the straps are so long, they fly off when you walk in them! Also, there is a label pasted on the sole, that is jagged and was painful to walk on, so I removed them. Additionally, they are very slippery and difficult to walk in! I would not buy these again."
2,Really cute but very uncomfortable,"These shoes were adorable! The perfect summer sandal to wear casual or dress up a bit. Unfortunately, the straps were very uncomfortable on my feet and they didn't have a lot of support. The shoes were quite stiff and probably wouldn't have softened over time so I had to return them. Wish I found a pair exactly like them that were more comfortable."
2,Not Exactly What I Expected,"I read this book because I really enjoyed Southgate's The Fall of Rome. Third Girl from the Left; however, is no Fall of Rome. Southgate attempts to create a link between three generations of women from the same family by imbuing each of them with a love film. Despite her valiant attempt, the stories just don't come together well. Yes, each of the characters finds escape/ solace at the movies, but in spite of this common link, as well as the link of emotional distance between mothers/daughters, and artistic aspirations, there are too many distractions in the book to make it work well. Southgate tries to cram too much into one book- a cursory look at the infamous Tulsa race riots; an exploration of Black women and lesbianism/sexuality; familial estrangement; and the history of the Blaxploitation movement in film. An entire novel could be written about any one of these topics, but to shove them altogether in one novel, gives short shrift to them all."
2,how disappointing!,"I could not believe that this is the same Martha Southgate who wrote the superb Fall of Rome, a book that I've recommended to everyone I know for its remarkable characters and touching insights. Third Girl, by comparison, is a potboiler, with a cheesy plot, clichéed dialogue, and boring passages. The racial element is one-dimensional, completely lacking the power of the previous book. Let's hope Southgate regains her form with her next novel."
4,"Excellent, engaging read.","I haven't read FALL OF ROME, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I thought THIRD GIRL FROM THE LEFT was a great read. From a plot standpoint, the story kept moving and I was never bored or disinterested. There were times when the writing, from a literary standpoint, was incredibly inoriginal, but overall, the book does a great job of telling its story -- the story of a family of women, their dreams, their secrets and their imperfections."
4,Third Girl from the Left,A very interesting read covering three distinct contrasting eras of Black Women. Many surprises and unexpected turns. What one must do to pursue one's dreams.
5,In a class by itself,"In my never-ending search for imaginative electronic music that is decidedly outside the mainstream (regardless of how you label the styles), it is inevitable that I would come across this. I have to say it has more creativity-per-minute than most anything I've heard recently. Unlike much that tries to sound experimental by simply layering sound upon unrelated sound, this music is actually COMPOSED, beginning to end. There is shape, flow, contrast, sound design, form, texture, and above all, unbelievable rhythm. And, lest I sound too serious in my remarks, there is a kind of humor that underlies everything. I love this album."
3,Less of a Leading Light?,"So what do you do when your own brand of musical innovation is appropriated and regurgitated by all and sundry in the leftfield dance scene? Tom Jenkinson's first response on the ""Music Is Rotted One Note"" album was to retreat into the dense jazz-fusion territory mapped by the likes of Weather Report and Jaco Pastorius, going easier on the beats and filling the space with a milkier continuum of sounds. But ""Go Plastic"" is a return to his original formula - the cut-and-paste overdrive of pulverised and reassembled beats that made Jenkinson a legend of the drum 'n bass genre. This time it is augmented by a further array of overtly percussive sounds, mostly synthetic in origin. The result is much less of a trailblazer than his earlier work - the appeal of Squarepusher's music has been primarily mathematical in nature, and it is this element that is most easily decoded and copied by lesser talents."
5,bread&beats,bread for me !with the right amount of butteris a toast drilling your noseand here it comes the marmalade
2,Just sounds thrown together,"I was introduced to Squarepusher after hearing ""My Red Hot Car"", good song so I thought his other stuff would be good, too. Got the CD, big mistake. They're just sounds mixed together...I don't know it's just not very appealing.--Daniel"
5,He's an aquired taste,"First album of his that I got. I don't really know what to say. You'll either love his style or hate it, no in between. If you're into pop/dance, don't even waste your time. But if you're down for trying something new, strap in and go for the ride."
5,calculus manifesto,"the best of the best, jenkinson showcases his beat crunching wizardry in the most powerful and driving release to date. unstoppable at every turn, each track delivers what you want in exact measured doses. almost a return to the legendary big loada style, but with thrice as many brainwaves. squarepusher is going to have to break his pelvis to top this ethereal morsel. possibly the best math and brain sex ever released in human history, no doubt. i can't possibly over.emphasize.this.album. perfunction achieved!"
3,Crisp crunches,"3 1/2On the other side of Jenkinson's informed jazzy constructs and clean drill-and-bass melodies are these largely atonal metallic freakouts, doubtlessly bordering on repetitiously self-absorbed as a whole though yielding a surprising amount of textural depth if one is in the mood for noise baths."
3,Indulgent Digiscrap,"Hmmm, if only he'd take less than a week to make an album perhaps he'd get the courage up to edit and take some responsibility. In the meantime I suppose mr. jenks is just going to keep dinking us though and slipping in a brilliant track or two for each disc. Can't wait for him to pull his trousers up and try to go the distance."
3,Mixed feelings........,"I love the illustrations and excerpts from the Pooh stories, but there isnt a lot of space available for the calendar. Great for a Pooh fan (unless you are an organization nut!)"
1,Horrible,"This is, by far, one of the most poorly written books that I have ever read. Trying to follow the author's storyline and wade through the multitude of grammatical errors gave me a headache."
2,Save your money for better books,"This is an easy-to-read book, with some interesting ideas about the future of transportation and good references. Although, some ideas are exciting, the future of telecommunications and transportation issue is largely neglected. The ideas presented in the book are hardly new, and anyone in the field can easily think about these ideas after a short session of brainstorming. In brief, I suggest that you save your money for better books."
3,A mixed blessing,"I must say the music and the lyrics are uplifting and COULD minister to the hearts of those in the streets, nightclubs, gangs, etc. I do believe that this album has not gone far because the anointing is absent from the vocalist due to the poor life choices he makes. I look forward to the next album, and to a renewing of his mind, body, and spirit through the Lord Jesus Christ. Otherwise, the one reviewer from OHIO might as well be ""bumping"" to R-Kelly."
2,Put God first in your lives!,The group needs to practice what they preach. The members of the group are living in a backsliding state. All the members seem to be sleeping with one another and so forth. Repent.
3,Don't Buy this Card if You use Windows 2000 or XP!,"I bought this card about two years ago and found it to be an excellent value. It offers an incredible amount of functions for the price. However, I have been extremely frustrated with the manufacturer's attitude regarding providing drivers for Windows 2000 and XP. For the longest time, they would not even comment on the possibility of providing drivers for these two operating systems. I migrated to Windows XP about three months ago and have been checking Guillemot's website for drivers practically on a daily basis. Finally, the company provided a small note to the effect that they will provide no 2000/XP drivers for this card. They blame it on the chipset. I can't figure out what difference that makes!"
2,No support for XP makes this card worthless now,"I bought this card by mail order and was told by the salesperson (not from this store!) that I could download drivers for 2000 and XP. Once it arrived and after a futile search of the net, I realised that there is no support for NT architecture. Who wants to use a sound card on an antiquated operating system!OK to be fair, my band did a bit of recording running 98 and Cakewalk and the ISIS card performed pretty well. But now I am stuck dual booting with 98 if I ever want to use my soundcard!Take my advice, don't buy this card and check out whatever product you are thinking about thouroughly so you don't get caught out like me."
1,Felt no different,"This product is advertised as being ""Well known for stamina and endurance."" I felt no different after taking this product consistently as directed for several weeks."
1,Do not trust the picture. The actual item is a cheap yellow filter!,"I needed to buy a filter for my Eureka vacuum 410. After browsing a couple of sellers on Amazon, I decided to go for this one. Big mistake!!There are other places selling a yellow filter for 410 and 411. It costs less than 9 bucks. But in the end I decided to go for this one because the picture shows a black filter, which seems to be the same as the original filter in the vacuum, so I thought the $12 extra cost is worth it.But when I received the package a few days later, I realized that it is exactly the same cheap yellow filter sold at other places!!I am very disappointed by the seller. Being honest in business is the key to success. I will never buy from them again and I urge all buyers NEVER to buy from them."
5,Best multivitamin I've taken,"There's not much I can say except that these are the best multivitamins I've ever taken. I take it without food all the time and have never had any side effects. And although I've been taking these for a few months now and have yet to notice any extra energy or anything of that sort, I still absolutely love them and recommend them to all my friends.The only negative is the slight aftertaste but I just decided to take the vitamin first before my other medication and by the time I'm through my four pills, the taste is gone so it doesn't bother me as much as it might others."
4,Definitely a step up from One A Day!,"I was looking for a vitamin that would help me get through my hectic days with school, work and my rigorous fitness routine. I used to use Women's One a Day and never really noticed anything different. My pee would be a little bright once and then go back to normal - that was it. With this multivitamin, I definitely notice a difference in my overall energy level and attitude. Oh, and my pee stays brighter, longer meaning it doesn't metabolize and disappear after an hour or two. I wasn't expecting anything but was definitely not disappointed. I do notice that if I take this on an empty stomach or with a breakfast smoothie that I will immediately feel sick. It is best to take it with a meal and a decent amount of water. Overall, I would definitely recommend this multivitamin."
5,Great product/Quality +,"PLEASED. In my assessment as a R.N. myself, these appear to be common size for a once daily tab if you have ever taken a one daily type vitamin from health food store. No problems for swallowing tablet on my part BUT, if you have ""difficulty swallowing"" med/large tabs you may want to cut in half? They seem well worth it esp. bottle w/ 150 tabs of single doses available of high end multivitamin. Good luck choosing, Nurse J.P.:)"
5,very nice,"Package,shipping,goods,very nice. Want to be able to improve their physique and immunity. Look forward to good health effects. Should continue to use."
4,So far so good,I have a semi-active lifestyle and I am also pursuing a degree part time. Nothing seemed to be helping me to stay awake and concentrate naturally. I had tried Bio-strath before but to get the effects that I am getting now required 3 tabs a day.I tried this based on the reviews and I have to say after 1 week I began to see a difference.Will definitely purchase again.
5,The first multivitamin that I actually felt benefits from taking....,"I first tried these vitamins during a free trial conducted by a magazine-- and was both surprised and quite pleased to see the organic and naturally sourced ingredients in the product (factors that I prioritize). In addition, I had never taken probiotics either in a multi or separately and was pleased by the results. I actually felt a positive impact on my digestive health. I would highly recommend these vitamins- including purchasing them on amazon (they are several dollars cheaper than at Whole Foods),"
4,"Easy, Just Once A Day","I have been taking these vitamins for about two years because I only have to take them once a day to get full value. The ideal way to take vitamins is twice a day, I always forgot as I suspect most of us would with so many detractions. I was taking another brand, which had a high potency listing of ingredients until I read the lablel carefully, the potency was based on taking twice a day. If you have trouble swallowing pills I would not recommend these as they are rather large and not coated, I am very satisfied with these."
2,Bad aftertaste - hard to swallow,"I chose this supplement because of all the wonderful ingredients, and I think that is all still great. But the resulting pill is huge, not surprising, and I'm a great pill swallower. I can, and do swallow several pills at a time with no problem. But this one is not only huge, but not well coated, so it got caught in my throat probably 1 out of three times. The aftertaste is just way too herbal, grassy tasting for me. I suspect it is the spuralina. I mostly noticed the taste after the times I had to wrestle up and down my throat a few times to get it to cooperate. I did finish my order and will not reorder. I'm sad about that, truly I was so hopeful that I had found a great mix of herbal and multivitamins. (sigh)"
5,love,"love these vitamins,they are gentle on the stomach and they do not constipate. I found others did cause constipation bc of high iron levels but not this brand."
5,You REALLY feel a difference,The real stuff really marks the difference between these and other a-z popular multi-vitamin brands.
1,Cranky me!,"I started taking this vitamin 3 weeks ago, and I have been cranky ever since. I normally have a pretty sunny attitued and this has been really hard for me. I thought it was an adjustment issue, and so kept taking them, but I have had enough. I have left the vitamin off for 3 days now, and I am back to my old self. What a relief!I will not take, nor will I recomend this vitamin to anyone."
1,Will never buy again. I am looking to replace right now!,"After reading the list of vitamins and natural ingredients, I was impressed. Well, they have an awful odor. Once I got passed that, they are too large to comfortably swallow. I broke them in half for easier swallowing. However, the after taste is unbelievable! I have to have juice or a cracker handy for the after taste! Though they probably may be healthy, I am looking elsewhere for my vitamin supplement. The search is on......"
1,Too bad of taste!,"I was highly disappointed by this Rainbow Light product. While this multivitamin is high in vitamins, minerals and herbs that would greatly benefit a women's body, I could not stand the taste of this vitamin on my tongue. Even though it is not a chewable, when I placed the tablet on my tongue to swallow it with a glass of water, I practically gagged. I hate to say it, but the tablets smelled like rabbit food...yuck. For future use I would only buy a capsule form of Rainbow Light multivitamins."
5,LOVE these vitamins!,"I recently fell ill and wasn't able to eat for several weeks. Needless to say that didn't help my state of health as we continue to try and figure out what is wrong with me. Having said that I found these vitamins and am so glad I did. They are very easy on the stomach and for what little bit of food I am able to consume these don't upset my stomach at all. I do feel they are helping with my overall energy even during this unpleasant time. I will continue taking these and would recommend them to a friend!I will add in the past I have tried high-priced, organic etc. vitamins and found them to be just that- high-priced. I also like the ease of taking just one pill rather than several."
2,didn't go down well,"I bought this for a friend who wanted to try taking a high end multi-vitamin (when it comes to supplements, brand really does matter.) She was unable to take the tablets because of their size. we ended up breaking them in half and she still had trouble with them. This isn't a flaw in the product as long as you are used to taking rather large tablets. However, she didn't feel that it make enough of a difference to keep taking them."
3,nausea,"I dont know about the quality of the vitamins but these give me nausea after a while, and I am not really stomach sensitive, I carry around pepto bismol until I finish them cause I bought the 150 bottle... I'll try New Chapter see how theirs work afterwards"
4,my favorite vitamin,"I noticed an immediate change after taking this for a month. I love this vitamin, and I highly recommend it for sensitive systems."
3,Daily vitamins will help to avoid big problems such,"Daily vitamins will help to avoid big problems suchas low energy,poor metabolism,sleeping disorder,hair loss,depression,skin problems.Provides brain health,strong bones.From my experience and knowledge right vitamin product is organic (natural).And right combination of ingredients.It digest by body for 100 %. (syntheticOrganic CalciumVitamins, Complex,Organicvitamins digest only for about 10%)"
1,Not very good!,"We bought one that seemed to work ok at the outset, but has since become more and more inaccurate. I could live with that, but the 'customer service' is non-existant (literally). I tried to phone - nothing, and have since sent three emails - nothing. They really don't care once you've purchased the item. All I wanted was to return the device for servicing and re-calibration. Looks like it will be back to a tape-measure!"
4,America in France,Frederick Palmer was a keen observer of events in France during WWI. He presents his views in a manner that many modern readers would find hard to understand. He speaks in this text not looking through the long telescope of history but from an immediate first person account of someone living in 1918. As this book was written in 1918 and has all the flaws of the period. Yet this book is very captivating in it's presentation and quirks suchas his description of the official USArmy view point on gonorrhea and why men first started wearing wrist watches(women only worn them before WW1). As a period piece and a snap shot of American History in the early 20th Century this is an interesting piece of Social History.
4,Review of the Villeroy and Boch Bowl,The product is good for me. It is beautiful and cost effective. I use it as my dialy nuddle or rice with special cooking recipe. I feel good with the bowl together with my meal.Amazon has good service for delivery and problem solving. I enjoy buying staff on line at Amazon.
4,Touchy on/off switch...but AWESOME!,"Thanks to the other review about the on/off button, I was able to save myself from losing valuable battery life...making sure I didn't accidentially turn it on before I wanted to use it.So long as you know to be careful of the on/off button, this product allowed me to run my IPOD, cell, Sony PSP, DVD player without fail. I had 6 to 10 hour down times without power while on planes/trains during a recent vacation to Europe(left my business laptop at home).I confess I worried this product wouldn't be enough, and I also purchased a Tekkeon 3400 for additional (emergency) back up, I was NEVER without use of my electronic gadgets!Expensive, but worth having for any gadget guy/gal."
1,No warranty support. Terrible product.,"The product worked OK for the few times that I used it. I did not use it for a couple of months and then the unit would not charge. I called the company's costumer support (they insist on only contacting them via email) and they said that the product will die if not kept charged for 3 months or more. They would not support the product as they only cover ""manufacture defect."" I've had many similar Li-ion batteries from other companies and never had them permanently die if you don't keep them always charged. I would keep away from this manufacturer from now on."
4,works well,"this glue works well, lashes stayed gripped until you pull them off. easy to apply and easy to take off."
2,this is not the right product as shown in the picture...,this is not the lash grip for strip lashes this is for individual lashes i am not pleased... will it work for strip lashes???
2,Don't know how this gets great reviews,"This glue must be for individual lashes, I tried it for stips and it was a mess! wouldn't stay on and when I try to put more on it's white (even after waiting for some time) so it looks like a mess. I also got some in the corner of my eye and it burns so bad my eyes still hurt the next day.Won't be using this ever again"
2,"It's white, not clear color","I was looking for clear color, so I bought this item, but it was white. Very ugly when I wear eyelashes with this white glue.Seller should change product description, not misleading buyers."
2,don't buy,not the best eyelash glue I've bought. it was really thick and I don't feel like it worked well. wouldn't recommend buying it.
5,great eyelash glue,"great for my money. when cleaning my used eyelashes, the glue comes right off with not much scrubbing, it won't mess up your eyelashes when cleaning them. i would highly recommend."
3,"Smells like fish, doesnt dry clear, holds pretty well","The headline says it all. As rating its usefulness, its a very good. Otherwise, I could do without the fishy smell and the fact that it doesnt really dry clear. It more of a milky white. I rate it an OKAY"
2,Very disappointed with this book!,"This book was clearly written by someone who lacks a basic understanding of linguistics and teaching foreign languages. I bought this book for my husband and he found it useless. Most pronunciation examples are incorrect, also the author doesn't give an English pronunciation of Albanian words, which makes it very hard for a someone who doesn't speak Albanian to actually learn how words are pronounced. I am fluent in Albanian and as I was going through the book trying to help my husband learn Albanian, I was shocked by the amount of mistakes, and incorrect translations. Overall disappointed by this book!"
4,Spirituality in your modern life,"""How to be a Mystic in a Traffic Jam"" is a thoughtfully and sensitively written book that is a pleasure to read. There are rewards and encouragements in every page. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to find an appropriate way and place to incorporate spirituality into a modern, hectic life."
3,Inspiring Words,"This book is a compilation of quotes of John Paul the Great. However, I was not sure of the accuracy of the information found in the introduction."
4,Wise & Inspiring,"The one I read had a different cover from this book but perhaps, it’s of a different edition/version of this book. But I took a look inside (amazon.com and the book) and found the contents to be the same, so I hope this little review will help you in a way. ^^First of all, this is a compilation book. The book compiles carefully selected words (some of which are almost like quotes) and prayers of His Holiness Pope John Paul II from different sources, and they are categorized into different sections like Prayer, Salvation, The Sacraments, and so forth, for easy reference. His talks about love, family, truth & freedom, God & the Holy Spirits & Mother Mary, hope and prayer are very inspirational and encouraging, and there’s also a short introduction about the background of the Pope.In all, this is a really nice book to add to your Christian collection, especially if you’re one of the many who have been touched, in one way or another, by the Pope."
4,Quotable Quotes from Pope John Paul II,"`Pope John Paul II: In My Own Words.' Whose words? The title was ambiguous and misleading. Though I found the book on the stands I didn't buy it. Eventually a friend gave me a copy and I sat down with it. The inside flap cover of the book calls it ""Pope John Paul II: In His Own Words."" That title makes better sense. Whatever the title be, the book contains valuable quotes from the spiritual giant of our time, Pope John Paul II. These quotes and prayers from the Pope's pastoral letters, homilies, encyclicals, speeches and audiences are classified into different heads. There is also an introduction containing a short biography of the late pope. It is a nice little book on Pope John Paul II, useful for easy reference."
5,A must for the James Dean fan!,"Okay the elements used for this DVD are not the greatest,but it's quaility James Dean stuff here!, this great DVD cotains:,The James Dean Story is directed by the late great Robert Altman,James Dean is a TV movie about the star(its the only feature on this DVD that Dean himself is not in),three TV appearnces: Hill Number One,I am a Fool(w/Natalie Wood),and The Bells Cockaiagne,trailers for his 3 classic films,his Pepsi commercial,and the famous service trailer on safe driving.There is even James Dean Trivia Quiz w/Photo Gallery! I got this for only $2.25+ tax at Dollar General,$ well spent! A+"
4,PSI Lathe Spindle Adapter,"Well made adapter. It runs true, and the threads a properly cut. The price is very good. There needs to be a 5/16"" center hole drilled to allow use with a vacuum system, but that can easily be done on the lathe. Also, there should be two holes drilled and tapped for set screws to be used to secure the adapter to the lathe spindle if you plan on using reverse. Both of these missing qualities are easily remedied in the shop, and if added to the retail version would probably cause a price increase (??)."
4,Quite old but still alive,"Like so many books in this series, this dates from the early years of the 20th century. It can thus take no account of the enormous strides in Biblical research in recent decades. Anyone studying the Book of Esther would need to get some more recent publications. However, this book is not yet superseded and should not be neglected by the serious student. For example, its study of text criticism and the value of the various Greek translations for that purpose is still unmatched. Some readers will be put off by Paton's view that there is little or no historical value in Esther, but this attitude can easily be ignored and the book used for its valuable material. In summary: use this book with care, supplement with more recent books, but don't ignore it."
4,"Great vacuum, but...","I really like this vacuum for it's price and features. My only problems with this machine have to do with the belt. Accessibility to the belt requires removing 7 screws to disassemble the roller assembly, etc., to gain access to the belt area to change it. Also, could not find replacement belts anyplace but a vacuum store. Otherwise, this is a great vacuum for the price, with features usually found only in much more expensive machines."
4,Awesome suction,"This is my first bagless vacuum. It came in one piece which was super convenient. Lots of nice ""bells and whistles"" too. The first time I used it I was amazed at how powerful the suction was. I've lived in a newly constructed house just under a year and the amount of dog hair and carpet fuzz that it picked up was astounding. It seemed like my old vacuum hadn't been working at all, for all the stuff the Hoover picked up the first time. Satisfyingly disgusting! The only downside to the bagless vacs that aren't super expensive is that you have to deal with filters and periodically cleaning them. However, even if this vacuum only lasts me a year or so...it's definately going to be worth it for the price I paid."
2,Avoid for thick carpeting,"If you have any thick or shag carpeting, this is not the Hoover product for you. It works great on thick carpets the first time out of the box. However, we went through two of these vacuums and they just do not clean our rugs. The Hoover wind tunnel models still seem to be a superior product."
3,Love/Hate relationship,"When I first got this vacuum I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the power, the fold down handle made it handy to store in my coat closet, and the dirt cut was large and easy to empty. HOWEVER. I don't know whose bright idea it was to mount the tools on the side. Especially the upholstery tool. (It kept falling off every time I vacuumed until I just left it off.) I only had it for 5 weeks and the tool bracket snapped off. All I did was bump it into the side of my bed. I had it replaced but I gave a lot of consideration into getting a different vacuum all together. I guess the pros out weighed the cons."
2,"Decent gift, otherwise worthless.","My wife and I received this as a gift from my parents a while back. When it works, it works nicely -- the operative phrase being ""when it works."" We've gone through four belts in five months, and it's not the fault of the belts (they're thick, high-quality rubber) ... this thing just chews through them like there's no tomorrow. Ordinarily you get what you pay for, but for a relatively pricey EmPower vacuum, this thing is incredibly unreliable."
4,wonderful Vacuum,"Only bad thing i have to say about it is its a little heavy , but once uyou turn it on its like it needs no effort to push..it glides across the carpet...Love this vacuum cleaner"
2,Owned for about 18 months before it died,I bought this vacuum in June of 05. It worked great until about a month ago when it just up and died. There is no suction at all anymore. I'm not sure what happened. I did really like it when it worked. Just beware it doesn't have a long life.
2,Belt woes,"The suction of the vacuum was excellent and it does pick up, however, with owning it for just 15 days, the belt broke for no apparent reason. To get another belt, lets just say, service is horrible was never told it was on back-order and then when it did come in, it is taking another 7-10 days to receive this product (belt). Why a belt would break that quicky, I don't know, but I would never buy a Hoover again because of the ""customer service"" and availability of parts."
3,Noisy but it gets the job done,"For the price you can't beat this vacuum. It has good suction, a good variety of tools and works as advertised. There are 2 drawbacks that keep this from getting an outstanding rating. It is very loud and the noise reduction button is worthless. The agitator keeps going when the vacuum is upright making it a bit klugey to use in tool mode."
5,Easy to use Vacuum Cleaner,I received my vacuum cleaner in just a few day and I love it. It is not heavy and very easy to use and I like this because I am 72 years old and have arthritis very bad. I can use this vacuum because it pulls itself. It is also nice because the handle folds down it does not take up a lot of space in the closet. Thank you very much for this product. Mrs. Elam
4,Good vacuum,"So far so good! We really like this vacuum. It is true that the 'Hush' mode isn't really quieter, but I didn't buy it for that feature, and don't really care.We have two cats and a baby and wanted a vacuum that would keep our floors as clean as possible. This vacuum works well for us.I like the attachments--they make vacuuming our furniture easy."
4,Great Value and Quality,I was more than suprised by the overall quality and ease of use of this vac. Right out of the box it's a snap to put together... in fact there are no parts to do anything with. You just place the hose and you're ready to go. The feeling is almost like it's self propelled. You can tell you're picking up a lot of junk through the see-thru container. I'm real happy. In fact we bought two more... one for each floor. The vendor we bought this from was also very prompt in shipping.
4,"Great Vacuum, Needs work though","So far I like this vacuum. The ""Hush"" mode really isn't much different than regular vacuuming. The handle needs to be a little bit longer. I don't like the light glowing green, but my kids love it. I love the 3 year Hepa filter. Its easy to empty. Its great to be able to fold down the handle. Its a great vacuum for the price!!"
4,Love it!,"I LOVE this vacuum! I just upgraded from the cheapest vacuum at Walmart to this - and the difference is amazing!!!! It picks up LOADS of dust & fluff, and is so easy to push. It's relatively easy to empty, but I do get dust around the trashcan sometimes (that's why it's only 4 stars). I love the long cord too. Great vacuum for the money :)"
1,Don't do it!,"Learn from my mistake and buy another vacuum cleaner! I wish I could return this, but I waited too long and no longer have the box it came in. Two broken belts, and it doesn't hold much at all. Have to empty it twice each time I use it. Miss my old Eureka Boss! Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. I wish I had. What a waste of money!"
1,No Suction After 2 Months,"I received this vacuum as a gift in Nov. 2006 and within the 1st month the belt snapped (which is not very easy to replace). After a few weeks the belt snapped again. Ever since, there is practically no suction. All my floors are hardwood with a few low cut area rugs, so there is nothing that my flooring would have done to inhibit this vacuum. I was originally planning to buy the Dyson. My friend has one and let me borrow it. Wow...what a difference. There is no comparison. I plan on writing a letter to Hoover. I also had another Hoover (one with a bag) for almost 10 years and I loved it. However, I am extremely disappointed with this vacuum. If you decide to get this vacuum, good luck. My opinion is to invest in something that will last a long time."
2,a let down,"I was very excited about getting this but I am disappointed. It's really not picking up as much as it blows things away from the vacuum(not great when you have pet hair). I have a hardwood floors, I strongly recommend that you do not get this if you have hardwood floors. The wheels are horrible, it's hard to roll when not vacuuming. It's heavier than I thought it would be too and the hose also doesn't reach very far."
3,Not sure if I would recommend this product....,I think for the price this is not a bad vacuum. I don't like the short hose or that the extra edger does not have a storage compartment - unless I have missed it. It has good suction and does great over carpet or hard flooring. It does not do a good job edging. It doesn't get close enough to the baseboards for the suction to grab hold.
1,"So, you'd like to blow $89?","0 stars was not an option, so I was forced to give it 1 star. This vacuum is the biggest (literally, its huge and heavy) piece of worthless junk I have ever owned. I was spending $13 a year to repair my Dirt Devil FeatherLite Delux, (which is no longer sold) and the last time the Dirt Devil blew out my husband bought us this thing. He put my Dirt Devil out with the trash, and someone had taken it from the curb within the 10 minutes of him putting it out and me shreaking to the curb to collect it. :(I hate this vacuum with every fiber of my being. You cannot vacuum within 1 inch of the wall unless you use the hose. The hose has less suction power than if you were trying to pick up dirt with a drinking straw. The stupid hose falls off the unit when you are trying to use the regular function. It is LOUD, and it does a terrible job. Avoid this at all costs!"
1,empowerless,"u5269-900 bagless is a waste of money. Takes about 5 times longer to vacum a room and only get it half clean. Lacks power and filter is constantly clogging with minimal use. Pain in the a** to clean. Hose with power brush is only thing that really works half decent, but hose is way to short and it's no fun pushing around that small attachment on your hands and knees. Never again for a Hoover. If I could, I'd rate it at -5 stars, it's that bad."
1,VacuumSucker,This vacuum is very loud and does not work. The accessory attachment holder broke within the first month. We had a Hoover for about 15 yrs and it worked great. Pardon the pun but this vacuum sucks and not in a good way.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is one of the worst vacuums I have ever owned. Suction is terrible, clogs all the time, and for a bagless vacuum it does not prevent stale air. The filter is useless and when you detach the hose to do crevises, the suction is even worse. Replacing it after only 6 months."
2,Poor investment,"I own this vaccum and have been using this now for several months. I have less than 800 square feet of carpeting. This Vacumm truly ""SUCKS"". Yes, pun intended. It loses suction overtime and the filtration does not work well shooting dust back into the air. Even the special booster for power does not work well in corners. The vaccum also loses self propelling overtime. Very poor buy. I strongly suggest those who own this and have commented positively under these reviews to hold onto your store receipts or extended warranties as you will no doubt need this.Dadds m-powered"
1,Throws dust everywhere,"I am so disappointed with this vacuum. I have hard wood floors and berber carpet. Like another reviewer, I found that it threw dust everywhere leaving a thick film of dust all over our furniture. This is a shame, because it is a really powerful and nice looking vacuum. I am surprised that it gets such good reviews. If you have a problem with dust allergies, avoid this vacuum. Bummer. I am contacting Amazon today to see if they will exchange it."
3,decent thriller,"Better than most of Lustbaders thrillers, this one takes the hollywood experience and makes it interesting. The characters all have extensively fleshed out histories, and their motivations are all different. Instead of cardboard cutouts, the people and the story are gripping. The erotica interludes are also attention grabbing. When I picked this up, I was surprised that the story was so well written. With lustbader, I tend to like his japanese themed stories better, but this one isn't bad at all"
3,"OK, But World Funeral Was Rawer","Plague Angel is a fairly good album. Well crafted, and Legion's vocals are very black metal. The only thing that sets it back so much is the songs are too much alike and they are not as catchy as earlier albums. World Funeral had more hooks and more precise clean guitar work. The drumming is good, and that makes up a good part of this album. This album is good, but I don't think it was as raw and agressive as World Funeral, Pazner Division Marduk, F**k Me Jesus, or their earlier stuff."
5,Simply the Best,"I just don't have enough words to describe how awesome this sound card is. It beats the Soundblaster Live 5.1 series in every way. The only bad thing about it is the cable that connects the card with the external rack, but once you have it running ... you forget about it quick. Just want to mention also, I have upgraded my Soundblaster Live 5.1 Platinum to Game Theater XP ! I highly recommend this sound ""studio""."
4,Changed Review - upped rating,"Originally I had problems with the installation, I actually returned the item to store. But I reordered when it was on sale at Amazon.com I got it installed on Win2K by using the second to latest set of drivers. And customer support is EXCELLENT! They were of great help and answered the phone on 2nd ring (how often does that happen!) I have had great luck with the card - I use it solely for music though, not gaming. I used the MIDI and all the other inputs without issues. Anyone who bought the product will get a kick of the picture posted here of the cable, if you do choose to purchase this product you will see the cable is as thick as a garden hose - not thin like in picture!"
2,"Lots of features, never could get it installed","The card has wonderful specs, great panel design, but it has virtually no documentation and no help for installation. I am not a computer newbie either, I could never get this card installed and had to return it. Once all installed with no conflicts the sound was faint. To be fair I never dealt with their support line. I gave it two stars because if you can get it installed the features are very good for the price, but the hastle is not worth it. Bear in mind the comment about USB Hubs - they are not powered and a lot of things won't be recognized. Anyone who bought the product will get a kick of the picture posted here of the cable, if you do choose to purchase this product you will see the cable is as thick as a garden hose - not thin like in picture!"
2,great book bad binding,Loved the large print Was exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately after just two weeks pages and pages started falling out. Save your money to get something that will last.
2,"Great format, terrible binding",The binding of this book is terrible. I've had it for just a week and a good 5% of it has already fallen out.
4,JPS Tanakh Student Edition,"I'm taking an adult Bar/Bat Mitzvah course, and purchased this as part of the syllabus. Although I already have both the Hertz (O'dox) and Plaut/UAHC (Reform) H.umashim [5 Books of Moses/Torah] with commentaries, it's nice to have the JPS version of same, as well as all the rest of the books in the normative Jewish canon - Prophets and Ketuvim (Writings, i.e., Psalms, Proverbs, Ruth, Lamentations, minor prophets, Chronicles, etc.) all under one roof.My one critique is that it would've been nice to have some of the traditional (e.g., Rashi) or even Conservative Movement commentary included in the Torah part. Otherwise, a nice addition to a Jewish library (or to the library of someone studying Jewish texts)."
1,Printed back to Front,"I was very disappointed when I receive this book. I have to read the book from the right to the left, instead of from the left to the right. It is very confusing. I think the publishers have done a great injustice to the readers. Genesis begins at the back of the book where 2 Chronicles should be. You need to correct this error and stop selling it as it is."
3,Hebrew-English Tanakh Student Edition,I like the book but the printing is a little too small and the English and Hebrew appear on the same page so it's difficult to read and translate comfortably. Otherwise it is a good book. I mean it is the Tanakh after all.
4,Hebrew-English Tanakh,"'Tanakh' is the Jewish acronym for what we Gentiles call the Old Testament: that is, Torah, the Law, Nbi'im, the Prophets, and Ktubim, the WritingsI wasn't looking for a bilingual Tanakh/OT, I was just looking for an easily legible Hebrew text. I got that, and as it turns out I'm glad to have gotten the English translation with itIt's a linguistic truism that true translation is impossible. And Robert Frost said 'Poetry is that which is lost in translation'Any translation varies on a scale from translation to paraphrase. The JPS translation here is a little too paraphrastic for my taste as an English 'Bible', but it's close enough to give a reasonable 'pony' for a student like me to ride as I slog my way through the Hebrew"
3,JPS Tanakh,"I like the contents, because that was the pupose of my order. I do however, have a problem with the cover. I have purchased Christian bibles for less money with REAL leather bound covers. This one cracks at the seams, which means in a few months the pages may very well start to fall out of the binding. You expect that to happen with a book that is really old, but not one that is brand spanking new, no matter how much you read it....... If I'd known this I would have a. ordered a used one or b. spent a few more dollars to get one with a better cover."
2,Bad Binding !!!,"THEY HAVE A BAD BATCH OF TANAKS BOOKS AND THEY ARE PAWNING THEM OFF ON THE PUBLIC!The first day, several pages started falling out of GENESIS and it continues to shed pages!Save your money and get something of better QUALITY!!!I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Tanakh,I bought this bible one month ago and already most of the pages have fallen out of the book! Truly a piece of crap!
5,"Excellent Translation, Beautiful Publication","Not only does this edition of the Tanakh provide an excellent side-by-side translation, it is also a handsome book with a good, readable typeface."
5,Wonderful for students and scholars,"With Hebrew and English, this TANAKH is great for those learning Hebrew and those who teach it. Clearly marked, good interpretations"
3,Missing In Translation,My personal preference is to have Scripture with the original Hebrew language along side an English translation so i can quickly view and confirm the Hebrew the translation if required.What i have found with the JPS Tanakh is that not only have some verses in part been missed altogether but i believe that the translation into english to be rather poor in some instances. One example is YeshaYahu (Isaiah) Chap 8: v6. The entire second part of the verse in Hebrew is missing. There appears to be numerous other ommited text from what i have seen.A little disappointed in this as I believe the Hebrew writtings to be sacred and should be translated with the upmost care and diligence.The day that an original copy of the Brit Chadashah is found in Hebrew I will be over joyed.
4,Handy,"I like the two-column format. Although the Hebrew does not run line-for-line with the Engish, it's much easier to find the English translation of a line, if you need to, than in the two-page format. The print is smaller than I like, but the Hebrew font is very readable with very clear vowel pointings."
2,"magnificent edition, wretched binding","This is the best, clearest Hebrew-English Tanach out there, and essential to have if you're serious about learning these texts. The binding promptly fell apart. I phoned JPS and they took no responsibility for the shoddy product. Told me I had to take it up with the store that sold it to me -- really, and these people are in the religion business. Shameful behavior, disgraceful product.I've reglued it with PVC adhesive, but I will probably buy the artscroll (annoying as that is) because I need a copy that doesn't shed pages!!!!"
2,Hebrew-English Tanakh Student Edition,The book I purchased as well as others at my son's school purchased through Amazon are beginning to fall apart after only a few weeks of use.
4,A must have,"The book's design is very appealing and the letters are relatively large and easy to read, although it might be hard for a beginner to fully understand the context and find the meaning of difficult words. It's recommended to get a Hebrew bible Lexicon such as the The analytical Hebrew and Chaldee lexicon along with the book."
3,poor binding,the downfall to this version is the binding. The first day I flipped through the book pages started falling out.
1,bad bindings,Good translation but the book itself is falling apart now after minimal use. The cover is very cheap and the binding is virtually non-existent. This is a very bad product.
2,last one of her books I'll read,"I loved her earlier books, especially the military ones. I've suffered through her recent books over the last several years, hoping with each one that it will be like her old ones. I like that she keeps bringing old favorite characters into her new books, but then the newer books have inacurrate details that conflict with her older books. This book was the last straw for me. I give up on the author & will reread her older better books instead of the newer."
1,You have to be joking,"The ""story"" has absolutely NOTHING to do with the synopsis that is written on the back cover. This has to be the most ridiculous, insulting drivel I have ever had the misfortune of reading. I am embarrased to say I spent money on it."
2,"A ""normal"" romance that took a strange turn for the worst","I've never read any books by this author before, but the back of this book intrigued me. It started out as a ""normal"" romance/adventure novel and about half way through the book turned very strange and almost like a fantasy novel. I don't recommend this book, or based on this would I buy anymore books by this author."
4,"Great Info, Fair Writing","Jimmy Houston is definitely a big name in professional bass angling, and the countless tidbits of tips and tricks contained in his book are a testament to his prowess. Nonetheless, it is evident that Houston isn't as professional with his writing as he is with his fishing. The book was very readable and understandable, but it is clear that this was a somewhat haphazard attempt at putting his truly great skill into words. Bottom line: great info, good for a calm day when you feel like picking up some tips, don't model your writing style after it."
4,"Good writing, illustration for average do-it-yourselfer.","This book combined a simple, easy-to-understand text with deatailed pictures. Although at some times the illustrations were hard to understand, they still get their point accross and do it very effectively."
5,Superb Book,"I have been collecting children's illustrated books for just a little over 10 years now, and Trina Schart Hyman, along with Aliki, are the two illustrators that got me interested.Hyman's bookThe Fortune-Tellers (Picture Puffin Books)was a real eye-catcher as is this one and co-incidentally the two sets of illustrations are very similar intheme and nature, a very well defined village and landscape from Africa. Ms Hyman (the mother of the author) recently died and will be very much missed. I hope that her daughter willremain in the area of children's illustrated book. This is a stunning and very well written book."
3,"Excellent, I think?","I found this book quite profound, yet mysterious and confusing. Perhaps my knowledge of classical dance is a bit outdated, but I was in Cats. I would have liked more pictures. Despite all of these things I was enlightened by this cryptic tale of a woman and her dog."
3,OK,"Was homesick. Bought the CD. So-so. The Nay Taqsim track was good. Wardany/Tofaha bad. Hassan/Naima probably what you'd expect. It IS the only CD I have that has a Rababa though, so worth having I guess."
5,For anyone who longs to return to a simple faith...,"The Wisdom of St. Patrick was written by a gentle man. Aside from Patrick's Confessions, we have Mr. Tobin's, which are very rich and without the ""hip"" level sometimes popular these days. Mr. Tobin's contemplations and prayers are genuine and with neither rim-shots nor treacle. In other words, simply from the heart.This is a lovely book."
3,Tales of Silicon Valley,"If you are looking for a real history of Microsoft or the rising of Silicon Valley (this was my case), then this is not the book you are looking for. Instead, this book contains some articles of Ted Lewis (written between 1993-1998) that shows the evolution of the hi-tech industry.Each article looks beyond the possibilities (in the time it was written) and the possible effects (let's say predictions) that in most of the cases were right and leaded to the actual present we are living. It was a very interesting reading although it was not the kind of tales that I was looking for."
4,Great American - Great American Rock and Roll,"This instructional video was filmed in the 1990s, and doesn't follow the typical guitar lesson format. It isn't so much instruction as it is coaching. Ted gives a good bit of his philosophy and spirit here, but if you are looking for scales and chops you may want to move on to one of the many videos featuring a music school grad. If however you want insight into how a successful entertainer keeps his enthusiasm and energy long after many of his peers have crapped out and/or overdosed, then this is a must have.Ted Nugent is more than qualified to talk about what works and what doesn't. To be fair, he does show how he plays many of his signature riffs. The downside to the video is Ted making way too many references to his other interests (hunting and conservation) for a typical garage rocker.Are you a Ted Nugent fan? Do you play guitar? If yes and yes, pick up the video."
3,Ted Nugent Instructional Guitar,"A lot of great information on it, but also, a lot of Ted bragging about how great he is. He is a great guitarist, but he doesn't have to tell me over and over - I already know! Would of rather have had him demonstrate his licks and riffs at slower speeds. Would have been a more effective use of time on this DVD. Worth taking a look at."
1,Doesn't turn,"Wound up returning as turning motor is VERY weak and usually will not turn while moving. Got the 1:15 Ram and Jeep combo from New Bright and they perform better for some reason. I'd avoid this particular model. No battery pack, but can use rechargeable batteries or AA and not have to find & buy a new battery pack when it goes bad."
1,Don't buy!!! Ours lasted only 1 day!!!!,"Our $[...] New Bright car lasted 1 day. It took a month to get a new battery. After charging the new battery and placing it in the car, the car immediately began to smoke. This was almost 45 days after the initial purchase. New bright stated they no longer made this car and would send another car. We have never received a replacement.If yours breaks, don't contact new bright; send it back to the store you purchased it from."
4,Don't Pass Them By.,"After seeing Outline live at the Firehouse in N.J., I could tell that this band, if given the chance, could possibly be the best thing that has happened to hardcore in awhile. Their CD only proves my theory, especially with the first track of ""Passing Her Life By"". The energy of this first song is contagious, and it carries on and infects the rest of the songs on the CD as well. A must-buy for any hardcore fan."
1,what type of music is this,"well this cd is a great sound quality recording but the songs are all over the place. some are hardcore while others are poppy. they seem to take parts of other songs by other bands and make them their own. like the singers voice, but i am hearing way too many bands in this cd."
2,Rent It!,Rent this just to see D E V O jam with Neil Young. Fast forward through the rest of the tripe.
1,Neil! We hardly knew ye!,"One of the worst movies ever made! This disaster must have started out as some kind of freaked-out hoot around a campfire at Neil's ranch. I have been a devoted fan of his since Buffalo Springfield and his ""Rust Never Sleeps"" saved my life in 1979, but Neil should never have let this thing get out of the barn. We've all made videos for our own consumption as goofs but this is one stink-o-rama! A real quagmire; a dog-daddy!"
1,a ripoff,"This book has no basic point. Unlike other managment books which refer to the Theory of Constraints, this book confuses the reader instead of giving an example easy enough to understand. The GOAL is a much better read for the same basic information."
2,"Non-compelling 50,000 ft., TOC fly-by that fails.","I'm not sure what Tom was trying to accomplish with this book. It tries to be a history, a handbook, a textbook, and chicken soup for the TOC soul, all at the same time; and fails at each. At times self-serving, at others pointless, I still have no idea what Tom's GOAL was except to extract 25 bucks from my pocket. Aside from a brief bout with lucidity in the ""Columbo"" gag in chapter six, there is nothing worthwhile here. You can get the same thing from ""The Goal"" and ""It's not Luck"" and enjoy the ride a whole lot more. C-,"
3,Practical but Particle Sized,"This is a practical review of the TOC, but it is written in 100 word sections each with a header which breaks up any hope of a logical flow.It explains how to orgainise your business (buy it for that) but gives you no idea of WHERE you should want to end up before you start. There is no recognition of the customer, there is total focus on the process.I would seek out a copy in the library and check that this against my requirements, then buy a copy if it suits - it is great at what it is, a summary of the TOC approach - but as a business development tool, it's more of a loss."
3,Buy it for variety and whimsical projects only,"I am very pleased with my purchase of this book but I did not buy it for the afghans, doilies or clothing as I have many patterns for these things. The book is of course outdated to some degree as it should be for an older publication but there are some really adorable designs in here. I especially liked the halloween projects like the witch and pumpkins and there is a gorgeous ""Raggedy Ann"" doll draft catcher that hangs on the door knob when not in use. There are also several projects using scraps of fabric strips along with the instructions on using this technique.If you are looking for fabulous doily, afghan and clothing projects skip this book. Your best bet for clothing are the more recent publications and there are many afghan or doily books out there with a variety of gorgeous designs.If, on the other hand, you are looking for variety, particularily something different like whimiscal designs, you will find quite a few in here."
2,This is outdated crochet,"I purchased this book based on the fantastic reviews I read here on Amazon.com thinking that it would offer me modern crochet ideas for the home and a variety of projects. I also wanted something that would introduce me to crocheting simple clothes (I have been making afghans for a few years now) so that I could adapt the patterns to create looks that are fashionable for spring.Unfortunately, when I received the book, I found the clothing weird, and the house decorations not the beautiful tablecloths and pillows I expected.The saving graces of this book include a nice holiday section (pretty Christmas ornaments and stuffed dolls for Halloween and Easter) and some afghans.If you are looking for something current, it's not in this book. Don't buy it for its home decor or clothing patterns."
4,"Wide variety of funky, fun projects, but not for clothes","I agree with the reader from California that the clothes patterns are old fashioned, except for the baby layette. I also think that the fun farm vest with rainbow and rural scene for a young girl was adorable. The projects for home ranged from doilies, pillow & afghans to a simple-to-make dishcloth, pot holder and coasters. The doily and afghan patterns were more traditional, but the other projects tended to be whimisical--a red apple pillow, a dinosaur afghan, ice cream cone button covers, sun flower coasters. I loved the American flag afghan, pictured on the cover, as well as the other imaginative Holiday projects--pumpkins, a witch, snow crystals, an Easter rabbit and more. A good book for imaginative home projects, not clothes."
3,songs for a rainy day,brenda russell and chaka khan are the two divas that are the substance of this compilation. Thank god they both sung two songs each. Brenda helped write three. The only other selection that stood out was Time Piece by Vince Mendoza which was a tight jazz number that would make a great soundtrack score.
3,I like Janssen,This may not have been his best but it is hard to find movies that he is in.Moon of the wolf was the best one.
4,Moon of the Wolf And Prisoner,"Okay so Moon of the Wolf is one of the best Werewolf movies I've ever seen. Good Plot, Good Acting, Good Suspense,Prisoner in the Middle has a Good Plot, OK Acting, Good Suspence."
1,What a shame...money wasted!!,"My mixer is a Sunbeam Heritage series, Legacy Edition, 450 watt and I was mixing frosting and one of the beaters stoped working. My Dad took it apart wich was pritty hard to do so, and found that the gears are stripped and made of cheap plastic. For whatever reason, Sunbeam must have decided to cut on costs and used a plastic gear to transfer power to the beater. I had my Sunbeam for two years and the plastic gear decided to break. End of mixer. You cannot find a replacement part anywhere. Iam kind of mad because the motor and the mixing bowl workes perfectly its almost new it has not even a scratch on it. I tought I was buying a good quality mixer wish was gonna last for a long time. Ohh well what a shame... money wasted. I guess my next mixer is gonna be a KitchenAid."
2,Tilt Release Button Stopped Working after 1 Use,"Bought this on Amazon from a seller who said he received it for a wedding gift, never used. I used it once and it worked fine. After the second use, I was unable to lift the mixer head when pressing in the tilt release button. Repair shop said these mixers are made in China and China does not supply any parts. So, for lack of a .20 part, it is unusable. Had this mixer still been under warranty, he could have replaced it. Although the mixer was ""new, seller had received it in September of 07, so it was out of warranty. Reluctantly, I will have to return this Sunbeam Mixer. Would have been a great mixer, if the tilt release button hadn't malfunctioned (broken)."
3,Not at all what I had expected,"I would like to begin by stating I've owned numerous pairs of night sights in the past, including Meprolight Tru-Dot sights. These were a massive FAIL in my belief. I ordered the Orange Rear / Green Front Tritium sights and the orange rear was far more dim than I have seen on sights in the past. But that's not the big worry - the green front sight was also dim!Let me say plainly that my Glock 19 with Meprolight Tru-Dot night sights Mfr'd in 2003 were brighter than this set I ordered Mfr'd in 2007, side-by-side. And the night sights (SigLite) on my Sig Sauer SP2022 and Sig Sauer 1911 C3 blew BOTH of the Meprolight sights out of the water. There was no competition whatsoever.Do yourself a favor - if you want a gun with night sights already from the factory that will be brighter than buying aftermarkets like these then buy a SIG with night sights already. At the end of the day you can make your own decision. But I am highly unsatisfied with this purchase."
4,Nice,"Easy to install, easy to pick up in low light. Minus one star because they aren't AS bright as I would like, but maybe that isn't possible."
1,bad custmer service,"They sent me wrong item,invoice was right but item wasn't,had a hard time getting anything done sent package back but still haven't received the right item yet getting very upset with the whole process.Don't know haven't got it yet in over a months time."
5,Works as advertised,I bought these for my glock 19. I had them installed by a gun smith since I don't trust myself with tool. I figure if they needed adjustment at least the gun smith works at the shooting range. They work well in the dark. The three dots are highly visible in low light/complete darkness. The diodes are surrounded by a white outline so even in bright light the sights are easy to use. The front sight is a little longer than the factory front sight from glock. I'm not sure what they're made out of but they seem to be of some durable material. I would recommend these sights to anyone.
5,Graphics... Aguhhhhuuuuh,"God I love this card! I have used it and wondered why it's the best ever? Because I LOVE IT!! I am using it with a PF775! A top-of-the-line monitor! It's 17"" and the res is 1600-1200! some people say it should be bigger but it's arm's length from my face. I fought the cult of the machine in deus ex with this monitor, and I thought: man that floor is shiny, or In midtown madness 2: this is running at 16 bit color, 16 bit!! maybe 10 polygons on this car? are they crazy? I even played tribes and it looked like a quake III at 640-480 but my thing kills the enemy troops at 1600-1200 32bit colorz!! Love this thing!!"
3,"Arizona, then and now","I liked the product very much but was confused as to the billing statement I received. I purchased the item for $25 but the billing statement came from a different vendor and it saidthe cost was $12. It was not froom the vendor I ordered it from. It seemed to have been sub-contracted out to another vendor at a cheaper price but, I was charged the price from the vendor I originally selected. It seems if that vendor did not have my item, I should have been reimbersed if it was gotten from another company."
3,Not worth the price,"Waste of money really, I was better off buying a large pack of raffia. Too small to use effectively fo costume."
3,Strawmans feet,"I bought the costume and the accessory was just an add on. It did help a little bit with the look, but it could have been left out without harming the effect. That's why a three star rating."
2,May work for one Halloween?,Well it didn't cost much but it really is cheaply made. I probably would not run to craft store and do it on my own for the money I paid but doubt it will last for a long time. It does help make the scarecrow costume look better though.
3,Not enough hay....,I am giving this a 3 star because it just didn't have enough hay on it. I doubled up around my son's neck and put some on his head and didn't put any on his ankles as shown in the Wiz scarecrow costume picture to make it look better. I also wish they cut the straw unevenly to look more realistic. But it worked for my son's scarecrow costume but I wish it was better since I paid almost $10 for it.
1,not worth its price,"These straw cuffs are cheap and rugged. As advertised for costume use, they should of used a material better suited for skin contact as this will annoy and irritate someone if worn for more than 10 minutes. It's better left for use as decorations on your front porch or something. If given a second chance, I wouldn't pay half price what I paid for them."
3,"Enjoyable version of the classic,with evil Crabbe a standout","Obviously, Len Maltin never saw the film, as he has the lead roles reversed. Actually, Jon Hall plays Major Duncan Heyward, and Michael O'Shea plays Hawk-Eye. Color, and an interesting cast, make this version linger in your memory. Buster Crabbe has the best non-starring role, of his career, as the villainous Magua."
2,last of the redmen,"In responce to the information given in the Editorial Review of The Last Of The Redmen.The character Cora, (Julie Bishop) does not enter into an ill-fated relationship with the character Magua (Buster Crabbe), she enters into a relationship with the character Uncas (Ric Vallin).Michael O Shea, plays the part of Hawkeye, and not Major Howard.Jon Hall, plays the part of Major Howard, and is not the least bit odious.But, as in most versions of the novel, The Last Of The Mohicans, some of the characters from the novel do not appear in the adaptations.In this version, a child character Davy (Buzz Henry), appears, if any character in the film is odious, it is surely this one, and he`s not mentioned in the novel.The character Chingasgook, Uncas`s father, who is one of the main characters in the novel, and other versions of this book, does not even appear in this movie.I think whoever reviewed this movie, should have watched it more closely, and at least got their facts correct."
5,Black Hills Gold Watch,"I lost my first Black Hills Gold watch at the Minneapolis airport several years ago and didn't realize it was missing until the plane headed toward Vienna. I was heartbroken as I loved that watch.I spent quite awhile researching Black Hills Gold Watches on the internet when I finally found the watch of my dreams. It's not like my original one but just as gorgeous. I've had many compliments, folks telling me how elegant the watch is--and it really is!Only minor complaint is that the inside of the band has caused an itchy rash on my wrist. Probably has to do with me and not the watch."
3,All work and no play,This video reminds me of something parents who push their kids to hard would use to train their babies. The music is not arranged for babies and there are no puppets or funny moments just a lot of floating numbers and letters repeated over and over and over. Its a little too much for us. Our son watches but doesn't smile or react like he does with Baby Mozart or Shakespear.
2,Not Quite a Winner,"I admit I'm not too excited about this type of video, but with the high marks that this video received I was ready to jump in. Being the LEFT side of the brain I was expecting the video to uphold the laws of physics. Would it have cost more to allow hands to move the puzzle, stacking toys? This video contains shadows holding and moving stacking rings. And many items that just appear. While this is common for this type of video, I'd really like one duplicates reality and shows the physical action related to the appearance of objects."
4,A Fun Addition to the Barbie Movie Canon,"This film is not as classic or heartwarming as the earlier princess movies, but it is certainly hilarious and a lot of fun. Ken was the star here. The obstacles he experiences on his journey to Barbie will keep you laughing the whole way through. If older fans are willing to keep an open mind, they should enjoy it as much as newcomers will. Like many older fans, I'm hoping Mattel will return to the fairy tale-inspired movies, but all in all the film delivered for this long-time Barbie Movie Fan."
5,I LOVE this Movie!,"Ok, I like all the Barbie Movies, but this one is special, absolutely my favorite! it's exciting and extremely well paced and plotted. It draws on the roots of Barbie - STYLE! Upbeat, and with strong characters. The Zombie Peas are a blast, but so is the use of puns, visual jokes, and beautifully handled dialog. It delivers a message of strength and hope, with themes of the power of friendship and love, perseverance in the face of seemingly impossible obstacles (Ken's labor of love trying to get to France becomes The Odyssey with Belly laughs)It's a delight! I think most of the negative reviews I've seen are generated by the expectation that Barbie Cartoons be limited to the kindergarten level. Here's one that made me want to pull out my Barbies and do my own Fashion Show. and definitely resonated, speaking both to my inner child, and my outer adult.In my view, if you only see one Barbie Movie it's gotta be this one!"
1,What is happening to Barbie movies?,"Each new Barbie movie seems to move further and further away from the classy fairytales they started out with. The dating, internet and social networking references in this movie are questionable for young girls. Also the movie is just not very good. I loved the early fairy tales and even the Fairytopia series but this movie along with the Mermaid Tale and Thumbelina are second rate. Mattel, please get back to the fairytales."
4,"Not the best Barbie movie, but not bad","My daughter LOVES Barbie movies, so of course this one was on her Christmas list! It's not your usual Barbie movie. The main character is actually ""Barbie"" herself, who is an actress who stars in the other movies (A Mermaid Tale poster is seen in the background in her ""trailer"", and The Three Musketeers is referenced) My daughter seems to enjoy the ""Flairies"" more than anything else. Overall, it's a good movie, but not Barbie's best for sure."
1,HORRIBLE,"This was just given to my 5 year old daughter for her birthday, she is watching it right now. I want to turn it off- the conversations are so shallow and the tones of voice they use are not something I want to expose her to right now (if I did, I would just let her watch the Bratz movies which are total filth). I just heard one of the characters call someone a ""Hateful hater"" definitely not something I want to hear my daughter repeat.I wish movies for children would go back to what they used to be- I will have to ""accidentally"" lose this DVD tonight when she goes to bed."
2,not good,i love barbie movies and i think it is inappropriate i like the story butken is gross some kids watch them kiss and want to have boyfriends ata young age its not healthy i don't like how much boyfriend stuff i can't watch itin front of my mom bad job mattel
1,I threw it away,"My 3yo received this from someone a gift and I just threw it away because there was nothing redeeming enough about the movie to pass it on to any older child! Even though it's not rated, there should've been an age suggestion on the box because, as other reviewers have stated, it was all about teen drama, break-ups, and fashion flair. Not appropriate for a young child. I've avoided Barbie products for my daughter until now, and this movie just confirmed why."
1,What were they thinking?,"I just turned this movie off and replaced it with Tangled. This movie is not for little girls. Kids don't stay kids long enough as it is; I'm not going to subject my daughters to teen/adult situations. Calling people haters, wearing skimpy clothing, talking about break ups?? No thank you. I glad I rented it instead of buying."
1,I miss the fairytales!! :(,"This one was horrible, I mean do we really want our little girls watching movies with ""Twitter"" mentioned? I mean come on they are still little kids, let's give them the old fashioned classics like Barbie as Rapunzel, Nutcracker, Swan Lake, Princess and the Pauper, Island Princess. I don't want my 4 year old wondering about cell phones & Twitter- what's next, let me guess, Barbie will be checking her Facebook in the next movie? And Barbie looks very old now, I do not understand why you guys changed her look so drastically from the old movies. She doesn't even look like Barbie anymore!! More like an ugly Bratz doll."
3,Not the best,"I will agree that this is not the best Barbie movie. I watched it with my 4 year old and she enjoyed it. The best part of watching it with her was (**spoiler alert** lol) when Barbie and Ken kiss at the end and she says, ""Was that really necessary?"" Made the experience unforgettable."
3,Nice but dumb..,"People who create Barbie movies..listen up!! SeriouslY: an aunt who acts 16?? boyfriend issues?? YOu DO KNOW girls of ALL ages are watching this? I have 3 lill ones..n liked the storyline..but some of it was a lill strange..anyways..the colors are very bright..different storyline..which was better than the fairy stuff! Please make some new storylines..everything is ""fairy"" related in most of ur movies..thumbelina..mermadia..fairytopia..maripose and so forth..its really getting old..sad to know aNOTHER fairy flick is coming in Spring. I won't even bother with that one. Overall this movie is nice, older girls will probably understand it and find it interesting. My older two liked the movie, but it definately has an adult feel to it. And its much better than Fairytopia and other fairy flicks. :)"
1,Thrown in the trash.,"We love the Barbie movies. Normally we just rent them from the library. For Christmas, my daughter asked for this one. When we sat and watched it for the first time, we were sadly horrified. The movie is filled with just plain teenage drama garbage. Not what we were looking for. This movie just ended up in the garbage, not even worth donating."
1,Barbue A Fashion Fairytale,"I ordered this movie on Sept 15th and still have not received it and it is 10-4-10. I am disappointed about it. I paid for it and now I have no movie, someone else might be watching our movie possibly delivered to wrong house. so I can not rate movie plus my granddaughter wanted the movie so bad I had to go to Target and buy it yesterday. so now I am scared to order movies again."
1,"Terrible, I agree!","I have only seen a few Barbie movies. I was really surpised at how good Princess and the Pauper was as well as Mermaid Tale. I liked them because they weren't really dark or scary in any parts and they have great songs. Anyway, glad I rented this one rather than buying it. My 5 year old liked it but I don't want her to watch it again. The scary zombie peas in the beginning were rediculous and too much for my 3 year old. The story went on to be superficial, un-fun, lame attempt at humor with young adult/teenage issues that Barbie was dealing with. The dresses are very pretty and sparkly which I think is the real attraction to the movie. Get the paraphenalia for your kids if you want but skip the movie!"
1,"Horrible Barbie, shame on Mattel","Sadly, I did not screen this movie when I rented it for my daughter. The first scene I overheard was Barbie being broken up by Ken via text message. Sadly, this movie made it to my daughter's wish list to Santa. Thank you other Amazon reviews for reminding me what trash it was. Sad sad excuse for a Barbie movie, lowers the bar entirely."
5,Barbie: A fashion Fairytale - Awesome Movie! :D XD,Hello I'm an autistic adult.This is my review on Barbie: A Fashion FairyTale dvd movie.To start off I'm 23 & also a big barbie fan. Anyway's I bought this a couple of weeks ago at wal-mart on release date & can honestly say I love this movie I'm not big on fashion show's etc but this movie is really good. I really enjoyed it! & am going to watch it a couple of more times. I like how the movie isn't real kiddie fide & more on a more mature basis. I can't stand when they play down the barbie movie's! Barbie is for fan's young & old not just little kids!Happy dvd hunting! XD
2,"This one may need to get ""accidentally"" scratched","Two stars only because my daughter likes it and everything is right in the end. But I truly dislike the way Barbie is turning into Bratz. :( I'm embarrassed because I've stood up for the Barbie movies to other moms who said they would NEVER buy one. Well, not any more! The Barbie movies have now truly turned into the anorexia/low self esteem inducing movies that everyone thought they would be before ever seeing one.I just came on to check the reviews for the newer movie before buying it, because after Fashion there is no way I was going to buy it without looking into it first. Now I'm not going to buy it for her after reading the reviews. Sounds like it's even worse than this one. Barbie has lost a customer. Which is sad, because the earlier movies were so good, with good messages.They need to learn that the kids may like this drivel - but it's the MOMS WHO BUY THEM!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"This barbie movie was the worst movie i have EVER seen! Teenage Drama? NOT APPROPRIATE FOR LITTLE KIDS! Kissing? in a Barbie movie? YUCK! come on Mattel, I got this to cheer me up because of breaking my arms, not to get disappointed! My Mom did not like it ether, So we gave it to my friend who liked it. this movie is HORRIBLE! barbie is a teenage BRAT in this movie, and some mean girl sends her a fake message from Ken, saying that they are breaking up! RIDICULOUS! DO NOT BUY!"
4,Barbie Fashion Fairytale,My 6 year old daughter loves all the Barbie movies. She enjoyed this one but not as much as the others. It seemed a bit more sophisticated than the typical Barbie adventure. She has had it for a few weeks and only watched it the one time where as the others are viewed repeatedly. It may be loved at a later date but now not so much.
4,Barbie Fairytale,This movie was fun for my four year old. She has watched it at least four times in three weeks.Some quality issues but not bad.
3,Barbie Saves the Day,"My daughter loves all of the Barbie movies including this one. Barbie with all her bling-bling overcomes obstacles with the help of her fairy friends. Although the movie has some mature topics and themes, it does offer some advise on friendships and jealousy."
4,Remember: It IS a Barbie Movie,"My daughter wanted this movie for her 6th birthday and was THRILLED when it arrived in the mail.We immediately watched the movie twice and she LOVED it.I tolerated it, but I have never really enjoyed a Barbie movie. Yes, so do have better music than others, A Christmas Carol for instance, but truthfully this was no different than any other Barbie movie and we have them ALL.The plot is the same, something bad happens, evil people make it worse, Barbie overcomes, Barbie lives happily ever after. The only thing different about this one is that is takes place in the modern day and doesn't involve Barbie as a mermaid or fairy.I actually enjoyed the first 10 minutes most. Barbie gets fired and Ken breaks up with her on the phone...hmmm perhaps it should be called Barbie Reality at Last!"
2,don't waste your money. get the older Barbie movies,"What happened to Barbie?!?!?!?! She has a different voice and now has a pointy chin with huge, bulging eyes. She looks like a Bratz doll, and I can't stand the Bratz doll look. Don't like that they've made Barbie an ""actress"" in this story who has ""acted"" in past Barbie movies. It was hard to explain to my daughter why characters in this movie looked like characters from other Barbie movies. Much prefer when Barbie sat down to tell a story and that is how the movie would come to be. And why do they always have to make one of Barbie's friends a goof? My daughter loves these movies, but I think I really need to rethink allowing her to watch them (and me purchasing them for her).On a good note, there was a piece in the ""extras"" on the woman who works for Mattel as a fashion designer and did all the clothes for this movie. That was fun and interesting. And my daughter LOVES the dance videos."
1,Not up to Par,"Barbie is an integral part of this household. We have all the movies. Including this one. After the pleasant surprise of Mermaid Tale, I elected to buy this one, though I was as skeptical as with the Spring release. Why is this movie so rotten? Well...first: Kelly Sheridan is Barbie. NOT in this movie. Where did she go? I hate the voice of Barbie in this one. It's not Barbie at all. I even looked up Ms. Sheridan on Internet Movie Database. As of November 25, 2010, she is not credited for any further Barbie projects, though there is a movie projected for release in Spring 2011, second: the subject matter is way too mature for the age range of this series. Children that watch Barbie, in my opinion, do not need to watch mess with boyfriends and cheating. That's a little mature for them. If they already are exposed to it, why add to the needless drama? Avoid this Barbie movie like the plague."
5,Just what the doctor ordered.,"My primary physician suggested this Horse Chestnut Seed Extract, one 300 mg capsule twice a day, to help relieve the swelling in my left leg. She said that another patient had brought it to her attention, saying it had helped a great deal. And it has. Elevation, periodically through out the day and at night is still the number one tactic to combat the swelling, but there is a noticeable difference with the Horse Chestnut Seed Extract compared to without it.NOW brand, as usual, has proven to be a quality product at less cost than most all of the competition."
2,Bad for me,"I took this capsule two times and on both times I started feeling very dizzy and then I it made me vomit about twenty minutes later. I got it hoping it would help with my spider veins, but the feeling was very bad. I am usually very tolerant to everithing I eat or take, but maybe it's only me and I just can't take this herb."
5,FANTASTIC! PICTURES!,"This book has some of the best pictures I have seen in a coffee table book! You can spend hours looking at all the detail put into creating these ""DREAM HOMES""These home are not just Texas looking homes but would rivel homes anywhere in the world."
3,Probably not the best guide for most prospective students,"Recently, we reviewed several of the current college guides in preparation for helping some grandchildren. Each guide provided some useful information that was not available in the others (and each was lacking in some way), but the ISI guide seemed to have a strong political agenda that, unfortunately, clouded the opinions provided. We would have ranked the Fiske Guide (best all round), Barron's (most useful for the 'best'schools), the Princeton Review guide, and the Yale guide all better than the ISI guide.However, at the time that I managed our departmental graduate program at a major university, I would would have had all five in my bookshelf."
2,Extremely biased,"I rented this ook at my local library after seeing that it discussed the colleges in an essay style. However, upon reading it, I found that the guide was much more focused upon politics than anything else. It looks at the political side from an extreme right wing view, making nasty comments about most schools, including the whole of the University of Michigan. That is why the top reviewers include Laura Schlessigner, Michael Medved, the National Catholic Register, a Fox News analyst, the author of Tenured Radicals: How Politics has corrupted our higher education and the author of How I Accidently Joined the Right Wing Party. This is not a college review book but a biased cynical look at liberalism at colleges from a radical view."
1,Yuck!,"Horribly conservative, useless unless you're like minded. Even if you are like minded, it's not a good source because it reinforces the wrong kind of thinking."
3,"Good, but not great","I thought that this was an interesting and informative book, but a large portion of it seems to be an advertisement for Accelerade and Endurox R4 sports drinks."
5,Must have for us schmo's who want to be competitive racers,"This book is a must for any competitive athlete serious about excelling in his/her sport. I'm a novice mountain bike racer who just fumbled his way through his first race season, and for those of us who aren't sponsored and don't have coaches, this book is invaluable. I think as I build experience, this knowledge will help me be competitive against guys with years of experience.The author is able to relay the scientific aspect of the body's functions during and after exercise to the lay person without making the reader feel lost. The book opened topics that I was familiar with but not terribly knowledgeable about. I now have a much better understanding about how my body uses what I put into it, and how this affects my performance. I'm also able to better plan my training/racing schedule because I know how to properly recover and prepare for the next ride.If you want to compete, you owe it to yourself to read this book."
5,Sound research; easy to read,"This is a well written book that is useful regardless of your sport or fitness interest. The author distills the latest research and clearly explains how to manage your nutrition for optimal muscle recovery. The book also gives clear explanations of such procedures as carbohydrate loading, and explains a variety of metabolic issues. It is incredibly useful, and a must for any athlete or fitness enthusiast! I found it impossible to put down."
5,simply great,"A band hasn't come out in awhile with a cd such as this one. great from beginning to end and impossible to take out of the cd player. get it, listen to it, tell your friends. met them at the kiss concert in Boston and they kick a**. Unbelievable I loved the song trend on the radio but never expected them to be as great as they are. go to the store today!"
5,Great CD !!,"The CD rocked! All the songs were great. Definately worth the money. The ""Trend"" video was cool."
2,It's Not that Great,"I see most of these reviews paraising this album. It's alright at best. the writing is sub-par. The only stand out tracks are ""Trend"" and ""Drive"" and all the others aren't really worth listening to a 2nd time. To compare this to Butch Walker's ""Left of Self-centered"" is crazy. Nothing can really be better than that album."
4,Great Sound!! Menu display a little too old,"I have been a sound technitian for 10 years now and I can tell you that for this value $97.00 THIS IS THE ONE TO GO FOR! The sound is great, crisp and clear, if you know about audio and frequencies you can change the freqs for each channel giving you the oportunity to customize it the way you wnt it. The DSP work in dolby and dts signals so you get a good acoustic (no distortion) from this receiver when watching your DVD's.The display is not so easy to use but once you get it its fine, anyways you dont have to change the setup that often. The remote is ok, works for what you need it. Am very happy with this buy, I had a Pioneer receiver before and I can tell you this one has a better sound."
3,"Good System, but be careful","Another reviewer commented on having a lemon system, I had the same problem, but managed to get it fixed very easily at a local service center. Now it works wonderfuly. As the other reviewers said, great sound, bad remote."
4,Peaceful,"This recording brings together one of the top acoustic guitarist with a first class woodwinds player. The orchestration is minimalistic but the atmosphere is always changing as Didier Malherbe goes from the flute to the sax, the bass clarinet or the bamboo flute. The compositions are all originals in pure Bensusan's style, with a lot of oriental influences. Everything contributes to a very intimate mood... but that's also what I would reproach to this recording : some spice is missing, maybe just the intensity of a live appearance. It's a very pleasant CD but you never get caught by the music."
1,Conspiracy Theory,"For leftist intellectuals like Klein, there is really just one thing wrong with the world: they do not have the power to dictate what free people do. Free people work, they organize into companies, they make things, they compete with each other, some of them get rich if they make things the everyone likes. For people who do nothing productive but have enormous desire for power, it must be a nightmare. All they can do is try to talk their way into power with false conspiracy theories or religions."
3,"Interesting, but flawed, and probably quite wrong in some respects","I think it's almost a conspiracy theory, which is always fun and interesting, but I would not regard it as more than that or a possible ""alternative history"", as she says in the movie.Especially Milton Friedman is depicted in, what I believe, a terribly dishonest way, because he was always against tyranny and war. While he says it himself, that certain crises (""shocks"" according to Klein) can be used to introduce otherwise unpopular free market reforms, he does not advocate for, or favor, any kind of crises. Truth be told, with Keynesian and Socialist governments, you will sooner or later have a crises that will open a window of opportunity to act - and as Friedman said himself, the course of action that people take depends on the ideas that are around at the time."
3,Average,"This CD was just ok. I bought it never having seen the movie before, so that might have something to do with it.There were 25 tracks on this CD, with 4 real ""songs,"" of which 3 are similar. This CD isn't something I would listen to normally, because the tracks are kind of repetitive. I really liked the ending theme, though. It's Ai no Inori by aki, but I don't think it's enough to warrant buying the CD. Basically, the tracks are made up of different times in the movie where different music plays, and that is literally how they are named, like July 7th, 2:24. It's pretty weird, but some of the tracks do sound rather creepy. Only the tracks with vocals really got my attention.Overall I think it was just an average soundtrack."
1,Stay away!!!,"Overall, I'm happy with most of the Irwin tools I've purchased but not this!!! What a POS. I agree with another reviewer that blade does not stay attached to the handle. Also, it is very time consuming and tedious to use because it can only cut on the back stroke-when you are pulling the blade towards you. Any attempt at cutting on the push stroke and you will bend the blade within 5 minutes time, guaranteed. How Irwin can associate the words, ""Pro"" and ""Multi"" with this product is beyond me.Notice that I used the word ""had"" to describe this. I tried using it three times and that was enough. It was gratifying throwing this thing in the trash...."
3,Forward into the past...,"Although this group has been getting a fair amount of press in alt/indy/weird music circles, this CD didn't strike me as the mind-melting extravaganza that their reputation promised. Although it is indeed a noisy and sonically dense affair, I'd hoped for some more groundbreaking directions in what they actually do with all of that sound. The terrain here has already been mapped by the likes of Amon Duul, Hawkwind, Faust, Guru Guru, early Tangerine Dream, and Popol Vuh. The record just didn't make a strong impression on me. All that being said, it's still a decent effort, some of the elements are quite interesting (such as the opening track, a 21-minute freakout layering walls of guitar noise and tribal drumming with violins, bagpipes, synthesizers), and this will definitely have some appeal to aficionados of some of the bands mentioned above. Probably wouldn't hurt to ""smoke 'em if you got 'em"", as it were, while giving it a listen."
3,outbloodyrageous,"if you are new to AMT&TMPUFO then this a pretty good place to start. the first track ""Psycho Buddha"" is a bit of a testing listening experience. i like the song, but i find myslef skipping it alot of times just because it exhausts me. it's almost like a fuzzed out rock version of Coltrane's ""Ascension."" the remainder of the album is top notch AMT. some wild electri-fried jams, some spacy droney pieces with beautiful vocals floating and drifting along the cosmos. all drenched in glorious amounts of reverb. 3.5 stars"
1,Art Noise,"It never ceases to amaze me that people find noise so interesting. I bought this CD based on various descriptions using the term ""psychedelic"" and on some articles I read praising Kawabata (lead guitarist). Before you buy this CD, make sure you listen to the samples. If you like noise, go for it. The first track is about 15 minutes long. You can call it improvisation if by that term you mean 6 or 7 people all playing different instruments at the same time with no coherent unifying theme. ...Now I like ""psychedelic"" and spacey music, ... But I can't imagine any drug that would make listening to this a pleasure."
4,Very cute,We saw this on our honeymoon in New Zealand and couldn't wait to have it. Such great memories of our trip. Cute sayings and pictures. Nice coffee table book for guests and to spur conversation.
4,Batman keychain,My son has loved Batman since he was about 2 years old. This keychain has added to his Batman collection that he has accumulated over his 22 years. The keychain has great detail and is very sturdy.
2,this was not in new condition like it was sold as.,"edges were worn down and some pages ear marked and slightly torn. my mother had me order it for a gift for her best friend. :( disappointing felt sorry for my mother I had told her how great amazon was. she won't shop here now,."
5,HEAT!!!,"After 7 long years since droppin' his first LP, the Mobb affiliate brings the heat for the year 2003! Production by Havoc, The Alchemist, Emile, and others are excellent! Shoot 'Em Up (Bang Bang) Part One in my opinion is The Gangsta Hip Hop Anthem of 2003! So say no more! Other excellent tracks on this LP are We Gangsta, Air It Out, Going Right At 'Em featuring PMD, Watch Out, matter of fact kill it because the whole entire album is nothin' but HEAT!!! I've been waiting 7 years for the R-A-Doulble P to drop another dope LP and here it is!"
4,Buck Diesel Review,Let me start off by saying if you like Queens Bridge music youll love this albulm the beats are good except for a couple all the tracks are good except for a couple and the lyrics are str8 if you are in to Mobb Deep youll like Big Noyd's solo debut albumAlso check out the Murda Muzik dvd movie
4,Good Quality,Pendant was good quality and was very pleased with it. Ordered from Amazon on the 11th and received it on the 19th via USPS. Could not track item via USPS tracking number but that could be typical USPS. Did not receive ship notice from Michael until I emailed them.
2,Yamaha Theater in a box is a mistake,I have had this system for 5 months now and have only had the opportunity to use it for three of those months. It seems that the DVD changer is non servicable and it was sent back to Yamaha but I have not received a replacement to date. SERVICE IS TERRIBLE> I was not called back when I was told I would be and have been shuffled from one person to the next still waiting to hear.
5,Mask Powder,Product does what it says...Instant lift..I love it!..My face looks and feels great with every use!
3,It's Safe To Buy This CD,"With The 3 EPs, the Beta Band set an impossibly high standard for themselves. The good news is that, while not as impressive as that debut CD, Hot Shots II is quite on an improvement on their last release, which was all over the map. That sense of not knowing what is going to happen next is back, especially on the track 'Quiet,' and the excesses that sunk the self-titled 2nd release have, for the most part, been reeled in, although ""Eclipse"" is hard to listen to without grimacing. The CD gets off to a slow start but by the third track things start to pick up. Almost half of the songs are rather uninteresting. Conversely, the remaining soungs sound just great. After their second CD, I feared that our heroes were poised to be the next Pop Will Eat Itself--latching on to the latest trend in order to sound current. That is not the case here. It is safe to buy this record. The Beta Band is still lovably inaccessible to the music buying masses."
4,What is the guy below thinking?,"How could anyone call this album boring?? I admit, it took me a few listens to get what was going on but believe me when I tell you that this is a great album. Listen to it the whole way through and you'll find yourself unconsciously nodding your head to the beat for about an hour. The Beta Band found a groove on this album and it is well worth the money. The sound is simply infectious."
4,First purchase by Beta Band,"I think this CD is darn good. Nothing offensive to kick the album off; then, by track 2, this thing really opens up. Great production, great beats, melodic Byrds/Moody Blues vocals with Mad Professor dub lines and Nitin Sawney strings. Very nice M/O music, but I'd suggest it's with someone you really know you like, 'cause the pretty songs are also about being in louvre (as opposed to something like Storm in Heaven, by Verve, which is just about flirting and feelin' cool). I'm gonna go buy their other CDs now, without hesitation. Good stuff, here."
5,An oldie but a goodie,"I heard a few songs from this about 6 or 7 years ago, but finally bought it recently and it's such an underrated album.Great songs! Great album.. great band."
2,interesting woman; boring book,"I bought this because I was interested in early women's lib-ers who ""just did it"" and in her 1930s era access to Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union. She certainly is an interesting woman with a will power, but her access and her insights into these two countries were minimal and superficial. While she ackowledges that she was a pawn, the information she does present adds nothing to the understanding of those two countries or to what it must have been like to BE there. The Artic adventures are more promising, but like the rest of the book suffer from a really quite juvenile writing style that does little to effectively or movingly capture the moments she experiences. Finally, her lack of introspection seem to suggest that she really did ""just do it"" without much of a real reason and without much struggle and that just isn't very interesting reading."
4,Nice overall keyboard with a few shortcomings....,"Excellent sounds, nice piano touch, easy to use and understand. The piano sounds are quite good - even better when put through a real PA system. My only complaints are the lack of a separate ""line-out"". I've been using a ""tip-ring-sleeve"" to 2 1/4"" jack insert cable and it works well when plugged into the headphone jack - just an extra ""bothersome"" step. Also the lack of Midi In-Out-Thru is kind of awkward - a USB to midi adapter takes care of it, but again, one more extra step. With all the rhythms and sequencer it is a fun instrument to leave out and just play and it records well. Casio is so close to having the ideal performance instrument, but they always seem to stop just short of it - and Korg, Roland and Yamaha are great but always expensive and way more stuff than you can use on the job. (I've taught band and choir for 31 years and have played professionally even longer, so I've tried a lot of stuff over the years)"
1,item not as described,"i will be returning this to circuit city, the description states this has gold plated connectors, well there are NO connectos here! this is nothing more than a bulk run of cat 5 cable. STUPID AMAZON! thanks for the waste of time!"
1,NO PLUGS,"amazons review says it has connecters but it dosnt!!!Connecting two ethernet wires is a pain. The wire itself contains 8 small color coded wires inside that must be connected indivudaly to the corresponding color on the other wire. These wires can't be soddered because the signal requires metal to metal contact, it won't work with lead sodder. Steady hands and loads of patience are required"

2,Dissappointed,"Interesting, if you are a Fulci fan. But hardcore Fulci fans will find it boring.No movie clips, no artwork of posters, no stills...nothing.Sound on some of the interview clips are bad.Maybe Volume 2 will have all the bells and whistles."
5,100 Country Greats,I brought it for one song-Seven Spanish Angels-but I have to say I really enjoy all the songs. I play the CD's every day.
4,Supplement,Heard of the possible benefits on NPR thought I'd try it. I went a very long time without illness. I think it may be valid.
4,"Surprisingly, a really good compilation album","I'm normally an album purist who doesn't buy a lot of compilations, but this one makes sense to get. I don't know anywhere else to get the Neil Young duet ""Are There Any More Real Cowboys?"", which is fantastic. The other incredible songs on this compilation are ""Seven Spanish Angels"" (available on various Ray Charles collections) and ""Pancho and Lefty"" (also on the album of the same name, but this is a better buy). Every song is at least decent, though the Hank Williams ""duet"" is totally unnecessary just like his all the Hank Williams fake duets with his songs and grandsons."
2,The viewing angle ruins it,Just finished using a Spyder3 to calibrate it.Result? Exactly what I expected. The super-narrow viewing angle kills this thing completely. The bottom of the monitor is reddish and the top is greenish. Despite being in calibration.Avoid this. Plain and simple.I'm replacing it and selling this one.
4,Small details make great reading...,"The quotidian details belie the depth of emotion presented in But Come Ye Back, A Novel in Stories. In a style reflective of many Irish novelists, American author Beth Lordan has skillfully captured that characteristic acceptance of fate and complexity of understatement in her presentation of the story of Mary Curtin and Lyle Sullivan. But Come Ye Back is indeed the sum of its parts and bound to be well received by readers who enjoy the epiphany of self-recognition amid the revelations of characters' lives and thoughts."
5,Beautifully written...,"It seems that some of the best books I've read are ones that I have never heard of and buy on a whim, just for something to read. This was one of those. An absolutely beautiful story. Nothing more, nothing less. Wonderfully written characters and beautifully drawn scenes. A minor concern is some of the dialogue between Kevin and Jimmy. There is a bit of it that didn't ring true to the way brothers speak to each other, but not enough of a problem that doesn't make this well worth reading."
4,Buy This Book!,"What a great read this is. Galbraith brings out a personal side of people we could only imagine exists. Of course, he reveals the same of himself. (Ever see a picture of him smiling?) The book reads quickly. In fact, my only complaint about the book is that I got so relaxed while reading it that I fell asleep too easily. (I read late at night). I'm sure, as I did, you'll be envious of Galbraith's acquaintances with the ""characaters"" of this book. Buy it!"
4,Names Dropped but you won't put this book down,"For all of you who think economists lead dull lives, this is the book to read. John Kenneth Galbraith was a glamourous figure in the Camelot years; he was a Canadian scholar who became an FDR devotee and moved into the inner circles of US leadership. This portrayal of the human side of world power is infused with Galbraith's wit and ability to observe the whole person, from Eleanor Roosevelt to Albert Speer to Jawaharlal Nehru. His portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy and her role at the White House is delicious. Whenever I hear the names of one of these individuals, it is Galbraith's portrait that will come to mind. And when I hear other economists speak in neutral tones, I will remember that Galbraith was not afraid to be a partisan, to champion a vision of how the world should be.This is a book I would give our new president to read on the airplane."
4,Lively anecdotes by a legendary figure,"This work delivers brief glimpses of a rich, remarkable life with the author's infallible grace, insight, and humor. Episodic, first-hand observations are recounted of FDR; Eleanor Roosevelt; Albert Speer; Truman; Adlai Stevenson; JFK; Jackie Kennedy; Nehru; LBJ; Chester Bowles, George Ball, and Averell Harriman; as well as insights on the problematic policy inertia that burdens most bureaucracies (and public servants).My only regret on reading this in 1999 was that it lacked an index and (given the quality) was far too brief. Some consolation was rendered by familiarity with the author's `A Life in Our Times: Memoirs' (Houghton Mifflin 1981). Both works are highly recommended.George W. Ball Jr's `The Past Has Another Pattern: Memoirs' (Norton 1982), written by Galbraith's close friend, is also highly recommended."
2,Requiem for an old Socialist,"My daughter gave me this book as a gift, I guess, because I'm an economist. I wish she hadn't. Others obviously think Galbraith's musings more than a little entertaining; I don't. He came across to me as asserting that the only people worth knowing were the ones he once served/worked with. I would rate some his ancedotes as amusing, but the flavor of the book seemed to be that of a very old man, whose core beliefs have been repudiated by history, claiming that the idea of a command economy just didn't get a fair shake. All these socialist countries just haven't done it right, and they just don't make 'em like they used to."
4,Absolutely Hysterical,"I doubt I would ever make anything from this book, primarily because I like my arteries too much. But it is quite humorous. There are many smile-inducing touches to the recipes that make this a fun read for a cookbook, particularly that each recipe is accompanied by the name and trailer lot number from whom the recipe originated. Many of the recipes also are accompanied by small anecdotes about the trailer residents and their ""bona fides"" among their peers."
5,Just what the doctor ordered.,Got these for cast gifts for a play I was directing. They were perfect and hysterical to read. Also had great recipes. Received them in time to present them and they were gratefully received. Thank you to the seller for timely arrival.
4,A fun cookbook,My family and I bought this cookbook as a fun thing to do for Christmas. We all had to pick a recipe from the book and make it. Some of the recipes are pretty good. The best part of the book though is that we were all laughing as we read some of the recipes.
3,Roby Ann's Down Home Trailer Park Cookbook Content,"A somewhat humorous book, but the recipes don't always contain measurements which leaves you guessing in some instances. Also, Ruby Ann is funny, but not as funny as she seems to feel she is. Having grown up in a poor and rural community, I am aware that my people find their happiness in life's humorous side. Ruby Ann lacks the realness that I intimately experienced growing up in similar circumstances. All signs indicate this book is a gimmick designed purely to sell to anyone who has a smidge of curiosity regarding how the poor half lives or anyone that wants to laugh at our poor populace."
1,good booby prize,funny title and cover picture. horrible recipes. great booby prize at a bridge party.
5,Charmed Rocks,I totally recommed this album for anyone who love the music from Charmed. This is a must have for all you Charmed Fans out there.
5,Incredable!,Though i was kinda sad the theme song wasn't on this album too.. it's still an awesome album. All the great artists of today including the wonderful Sarah Brightman who sang in the broadway musical Phantom of the Opera. This is defanatly a must have for any Charmed fan!
5,A Charming Review,"After I first listened to the 1st Charmed Soundtrack, I longed for a second one. It did not let me down! :) The soundtrack is filled with excellent songs. I know you'll enjoy it."
4,Buy a copy for your house and car! Your'e not going to want to take it out!,"""The Book of Shadows"" is filled with nothing but ""Cool"" music. The Donnas kick off the cd, followed by Liz Phair and the sexy sounds of Dido. Sarah McLachlan, Ashlee Simpson and other women make this soundtrack a powerful feminine statement.Every song captures the spirit of Charmed and throws the listener into a very mysterious, witchy mood. This cd is worthy of listening to over and over again!"
5,The Bomb CD,This Cd is the best this is one of my favorites. I have to listen to it just like i have to see the show every sunday. If u like charmed u will love the cd buy it it is nice.
5,charmed soundtrack,"I've loved the show for SUCH a long time, and I have ALWAYS loved the music, so I was REALLY excited about this album coming out. I HAD to get it, and I am SO glad I did!! This album is AMAZING!!! Definately deserves 5 stars!!!!"
2,The CD could be better...,"The CD was alright and while it had a lot of variety, it was missing the most important song of all: The theme song!! When I learned that it wasn't on there, I was really disappointed. But I still love the show regardless."
3,I liked it.,I liked this one but the first was my favorite. The Charmed soundtracks have a lot of unique songs so i like them both. I love Take it off by the Donnas.
3,help,does anyone know what the song is called in series 1 .. episode 4 'dead man dating' .. its at the end when piper is sayin goodbye to the man .. help .. ? xx
3,Charmed: The Book of Shadows,I enjoyed the first album more than this one. There were good songs on this album but it didn't have the feel or originality of the first album
1,New School GARBAGE!,"The ONLY ""Decent"" song on this ""New"" soundtrack is ""I Can't Make Me"". The First soundtrack is MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome!!!,I bought this soundtrack when it first came out and I haven't been able to listen to anything else. I love it.
5,Awesome Cd,This is such an awesome CD. The songs on this album are much better than the first. I recommend all charmed fans to pick up a copy today. You won't be disappointed.
3,Looking for Season 1 Ep 3? song..stone is sand and water,"Hi there,Can anyone help me trace that song? thanks."
4,Need HELP!!!,"I need HELP Im trying to find singer and song title..for season four..ep..#8 ""Muse to my Ears"" at the very begining of the episode..he dosent sing the whole song..words go..If its a muse Im missin..It would be you no question..This song isent on any soundtracks and I have searched sites w/song lists for each episode..this one never has any songs listed for this episode..Im desperate..someone please help?"
3,Charmed CD,"This soundtrack definatly had it share of great music. It's hard to choose which song was my favorite, but I'm gonna go with ""Fallen"" Great CD, great TV show!"
5,LadyBelle's Charmed Review,I thought this album was great. It just showed how much the music and the show has grown and that women can do what ever we set a sites on. I'd recommend this album to anyone.
5,New Charmed Soundtrack,I love this CD! It has all great songs that are inspirational to girls and women. I give it 5 stars!!
3,Not THE best,"to Little Gal ""Amy"" .their theme song was featured on thir first CD. Personally i dont like this one as much as the first one but it is still worth listining to"
4,HELP,"Does anyone know the tittle of the Charmed theme song????Also, where can I find it?????Who sings it????What is the CD called????Lyrics:I am the son, I am the heir. I am human and I need to be loved, just like everybody else does.See I'v already waited too long, and all my hope is gone.(I'm pretty sure that's right)Thanks to anyone who answers me!!!!!!"
3,Decent recording but nothing new,"The music on Horror Show is pretty good but in parts sounds like something leftover from the 80s. This is not meant as an insult because that was my era as an adolescent. But I already have an extensive library of fine 80s metal and I find nothing on Horror Show that really improves upon it. The main negative is the vocals. He sounds just like Paul Stanley. I can't reconcile Paul Stanley with true heavy metal. This was my first Iced Earth CD, probably will be my last. I would recommend this to younger fans who aren't as familiar with the 80s sound. If you're in your 30s and were a metal fan in high school, you have already heard Iced Earth."
3,"Half Good, Half ???","A quick disclaimer - I'm only giving this 3 stars based on Iced Earth material as a whole.I'm actually a bit surprised this CD has received such high marks. Since transferring the files over to my MP3 player, I only kept 5 of the songs on my everyday playlist. The rest of the songs just didn't do it for me. I do love me some Damien and Dracula though."
3,An Other Dissapointment,"A tribute to stories of the old times, not as good as it looks. I got this album a month after getting Something Wicked..."", and I heard ""wolf"", which I had to skip the first 40 seconds. Damien, which I had to skip the first 1:22, and some parts in the middle. Track 4 I skip, track 10 I skip the first 1:40, and track 11 is a song in the very first album I've ever had with a girl doing lead vocals(I skip a lot in that track too). The rest of the tacks are great songs, but this is no must get for any metal fan if you don't want it.This album is one whole hour long, but you'll only like barely 50 minutes of it."
3,"A bit disappointing, but...","""Horror Show"" is an above average album and contains great tracks but it is not nearly as good as ""Something Wicked..."" or ""The Dark Saga"". Those CDs are just great in terms of songwriting, atmosphere and heavyness whereas some tracks on ""Horror Show"" don't create this Icead Earth typical atmosphere. The vocals are good (as always) but I don't like the new style Matt Barlow uses. Everything else is good too, but unfortunately there is nothing extraordinary to find or explore on this album. I'm disappointed but 'there are worse albums out there..."
3,ICED EARTH = THE BEST !...,"Iced Earth is clearly the best American heavy metal band nowadays. Even if Horror Show does not explore new grounds, the playing is pleasant and accurate, the vocals are awesome as always. A solid heavy metal release, but not one to receive so many 5-stars ratings!..."
3,brian,"I recently stumbled upon Iced Earth by buying ""Night of the Stormrider"" by chance and immediately found a new favorite. I have since bought ""Days of Purgatory"" and ""Dark Saga"" and was anious for the new CD to be released. I was a little disapointed in the writing and the subject of the ""Horror Show"". Concept albums have always been disappointing in my opinion (except for Quennsryche's ""Operation Mindcrime"" which is an incredible album) and this one is definately not up to par with what I come to expect from Iced Earth. I think the subject is what hinders it more than anything. There is only so much you can do with it."
4,"""The Horror. . . the horror. . . .""","I was not an Iced Earth Fan before Horror Show. I have ""Something Wicked"" and was not overly impressed. On the other hand I'm a big fan of Demons and Wizards so I figured Schafer had do be doing something right.He proved it to me with this Album.NOW I'm an Iced Earth fan.The singer is still not my favorite, but he's growing on me, and the news that Demons and Wizards was not a one time deal (I think some of Hansi's Elfin Magic may be rubbing off) raises my expectations for future IE projects.Download ""Jack"", check out the interview with John at KNAC.com then check this disc out. It's worth it."
5,Nice..,"Wolf - 5/5 (fav song)Damien - 5/5 (close second).. did anyone notice that the lyrics to the chorus are almost the exact same as on ""D*mnation"" by Impaled Nazarene? I don't listen to Impaled Nazarene, but I was just searching through DarkLyrics.com and found the same lyrics.Jack - 3/5Ghost of Freedom - 4/5Im-Ho-Tep - 4/5Jekyll & Hyde - 5/5Dragon's Child - 5/5Frankenstein - 5/5Dracula - 5/5Phantom of the Opera - 4/5"
4,"What a show, Frankenstein, Drac","If you're a BG fan then this is the Iced Earth album for you (and maybe Glorious Burden). It is far more 'folk' than all the other Iced Earth albums and tells of classic 'horror' characters such as Jack the Ripper, Frankenstein and Dracula but the sound is amazing! Really, get this CD!"
4,Good Stuff,"At first the idea of a classic Horror inspired album was gonna be pretty [bad], but I overheard Dragon Child from one of my friends, and I decided I had to get the cd. This is my First Iced Earth cd and it is definatly not going to be the last. This album is not for ppl that think that Limp Bizcut, Linkin Park, and [stuff] like that are actually Metal.... Overall this cd kinda mixes in greatly with the Iron Maiden, Metallica kinda group. Just a good classic metal with some remeberal leads"
4,Great Album,"I've talked to a lot of IE fans who consider this to be one of their worst cds. I, on the other hand, think this is their best effort since Burnt Offerings. A big improvement from Dark Saga and Something Wicked IMO. The only 2 songs on Horror Show I regulary skip over are Jack and Ghost of Freedom. And Jack would be good with better lyrics. Definitely worth picking up."
5,Beyond Expectations.,"After the epic ""Burnt Offerings,"" the thrilling ""The Dark Saga,"" and the awesome ""Something Wicked..."" I wondered how many great albums Iced Earth could come up with, but thought songs about horror characters I don't relate to would be a misadventure. WRONG! ""Horror Show"" kicks a boot through your teeth, shoves it down your throat, and (with The Phantom Opera Ghost) rests it against your spirit. Great writing, great vocals (all around), and heavy as all hell. Turns out there's something to relate to with every character, after all. The lore of Wolf, the evil of Damien, the rage of Dracula... this disc is not to be missed by metal fans old and new..."
3,Not Iced Earth's highest point,"I picked up this album after my friend introduced me to Iced Earth through Something Wicked This Way Comes and Burnt Offerings. I was still at the point that I wasn't sure what to expect, and I liked Horror Show quite a bit. However, as my IE collection grew, I found this to be on the lower end of the spectrum. There is not a single song on this album that I don't like, but Dracula is the only one that stands out to me as excellent. Damien is deffinately good, and Wolf and Ghost Of Freedom are good, and I actually gave my english teacher a copy after we read Frankenstein, but as a whole, the album does not come off as outstanding to me.I give it three stars only when compared with other IE albums. Otherwise, I'd give it four when compared to most music today. I just think, overall, nearly all other IE albums are better. I'm itching to see what they do with the Glorious Burden (20 days and counting...)"
4,"Easy to use and mild, maybe too gentle","These remover wipes aren't greasy and they are very non toxic which is great. They could just be slightly stronger to get rid of all the residue. I really like the resealable package and they are ready to go, so you have no excuse for not taking off your makeup at night!"
1,Why not get every last ounce of cash left?,"1985's ""Dream of a Lifetime"" was Columbia's attempt to get some revenue from the then-recently-departed Gaye. It is obvious to the discerning ear that the ""singer"" heard is not the great Marvin Gaye.The songs themselves are dull and lifeless. They may have been written by the genius but the form that appears here seems amateurish, at best.I'd give it ""no stars"" if not for the fact that it does have a decent pic of the singer on the cover."
5,First 3 Songs are Fascinating,"The first three songs demonstrate Marvin Gaye's genius. ""Sanctified Lady"" is worth the price of the CD. It's as brilliantly secular as it is simultaneously sacred. ""Savage in the Sack"" is comical and poignant. ""Masochistic Beauty"" reveals a very interesting point of view from a man who's life was as rich in variety and texture as it was complex as the musical compositions that he gave to the world. In my estimation all three of these songs are even better than ""Sexual Healing""."
1,Unholy mess,"This is a Marvin Gaye album?! Taken from unreleased demos made shortly before his death and released posthumously a year after it, this album is surely one of the worst albums ever made by a truly legendary artist. His ballads are the weakest of any album in his career, others like ""Sanctified Lady"" are too robotic to be good for somebody like him, and ""Masochistic Beauty"" is such an unforgivable atrocity that sometimes I can't help but wonder if it was what Marvin and his father were arguing about when he was killed."
2,There are a few sweet gems on this one,"The songs I like the most on this cd are so melancholy. The title track, ""It's Madness"" and ""Life's Opera"" just really make me ponder and wish MG were still alive. They are so sad yet give us a glimpse into the man himself, his feeling, emotions, beliefs, hopes and dreams."
5,I want my DVD!,"WHat are you guys at SONY waiting to release this title on DVD?For such ""Powerful"" people, one must think that clearing the path for this should not be such a hard thing.I would pay, any reasonable amount to own this concert on DVD. DO IT!"
4,Lots of Exciting Moments,"While this program goes hot and cold, depending on the performer, there are some truly exciting moments. One particular highlight is Eric Clapton performing ""Don't Think Twice..."". Slowhand has rarely played or sung better...even the band is in awe of him. This is almost worth the price of admission alone."
5,This concert is a celebrating of Bob Dylan's music!,"October 1992 an impressive group of artists singing and playing music of Dylan.One of the highlights of the show was the house band BookerT and The M.G's.They made every song special with their performance.Also Neil Young has to be mentioned.He really felt himself with this ""Bob fest"" and his version of ""All Along The Watchtower"" was a monumental contribution to this concert.See and listen to all of the other stars {Stevie Wonder,The Band,Lou Reed Richie havens,George Harrison and others} and you won't forget this ""Bob fest"".At the end Bob Dylan himself came to the stage and closed down this rock document the way only he can.This celebration is a masterpiece for his music fans."
5,A collection of the God's of Rock and Roll,"Everyone who is anyone shows up to pay homage to the one who turned Rock and Roller's into ""artists"". ""My Back Pages"", with Dylan, Clapton, Young, McGuinn, Harrison, and Petty, is an absolute masterpeice. Also, Eddie Vedder's version of ""Masters of War"" is transcendent. You cannot claim to know anything about Rock's influence without viewing this video. One great piece after another. Must veiwing."
3,FIVE STARS ONLY WHEN THE DVD IS RELEASED!!!,"I WONDER WHY EXECUTIVES IN COMPANIES USE TO TREAT SO BADLY THEIRS CUSTOMERS - THE ARTISTS' FANS!!!IF ANYONE OF THEM COULD PROVIDE A REASONABLE EXPLAINATION (OR EXCUSE) WHY THIS TITLE HAS NOT BEEN RELESEAD IN THE DVD FORMAT YET, I MIGHT RATE IT WITH FOUR STARS!BUT I WILL RATE IT FIVE STARS ONLY AFTER THE DVD RELEASE. AND IF DOESN'T TAKE MUCH LONGER...WAKE UP, GUYS, AND SHOW SOME RESPECT (NOT TO MENTION INTELLIGENCE) TO MILLIONS OF FANS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD."
5,Great tribute form the industries elite.,We have to have this in DVD format... Notify me when it is out.
5,Incredible,"One of the all-time great concert videos. Even better than the wonderful ""One Love"" Bob Marley Tribute, which thankfully is on DVD. For those who can't wait for the official DVD release of this title, you might want to check out http://dvdylan.com/item.php?id=D487 (""The Genuine Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Celebration"")."
2,Eh!!,"While I agree it was a fantastic concert (I was lucky enough to be there) the VHS tape & the CD wars very disappointing for the reasons I am about to write.They didn't include the entire concert and I was also very disappointed in the Mixing. For example, when George Harrison first came out, he sang ""If Not For You""-where is that song on the Video and CD? Was it a mistake? I am also disappointed in the Mixing--they (Columbia) made it way too ""commercial"" in that the rawness of the music is missing. For example, towards the end of the song ""My Back Pages"" (a highlight of the Concert) Neil Young sang the final ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now"" as a solo. They kept the camera on him but when you hear the rest of the people singing-it looks and sounds strange. If they ever put this out on DVD, I hope they won't mess with it too much. Just leave it alone, as when you mess with something as magical as this you loose most of its authenticity."
4,Want to buy the DVD!,"Too bad this is only in VHS; it is absolutely an amazing concert. Alas, I will have to hold on to my money until the DVD comes out!"
3,Would work much better with a magnetic strip,"Seems Ok if range and counter are the same height. I had to adjust the stove legs a little and was not able to get it perfectly. It is off a touch but works. The main drawback, these did not include essential magnets. They slide so easily as to be worthless until I get to the hardware store and buy these separately. Most of the others I compared these to did include magnetic strips so I am disappointed in this oversight. I would have purchased one of the others had I caught this. They will be fine once modified."
3,Misleading title,"I was comparing similar products and accidentally purchased this one thinking it was made of plastic (based on the title). It arrived and as the product specs say, it's made of metal. It's a single item also- i dont know why it doesn't come in pairs.I returned it, but sadly paid shipping both ways for nothing. They were nice, but a little slow to respond and to refund me."
3,Could be longer,"I've purchased this product before...many years back. What I didn't remember is that it is quite short and does not span the full depth of the range. I would like to see it made longer. I have to shift it forward or back, depending which burner I'm using at that time."
3,Does the trick.,These do what they were supposed to. The only improvement I would suggest to the vendor is to include magnets to attach.
2,Eh,I find these are very difficult to keep in place. They look fine but I don't think I can recommend them.
2,Not what I thought.,I was hoping it had some sort of padding on the part that goes in the crack. It didn't fit and slid back and forth.
5,Healing genius,I first purchased this at Mayo Clinic Pharmacy. It is a smooth light and healing fast cream. It can be used on delicate and tender areas and the results is amazing. A little bit goes a long ways.
5,Don't Let This Classic Get Away!,"The first fly rod I held was my father's bamboo rod. I was four or five - that was more than 50 years ago. Howell Raines, noted author and journalist, was raised to fish the ""Red-neck Way"" of his native Alabama--hardly the bastion of the esoteric art of angling for trout with a cane rod. Raines learned fishin' from crappies. He learned about life from fishing for trout. The book's chapters are a collection of short stories about passions, friendships, and dreams. Fly fishing is the thread that sews them together. Each meander of the stream provides Raines a connection between dry flies and living. Humorous recollections are tied into the serious patterns of growing older and wiser. Matching hatches become tests of loyalty and devotion and love. A must read for the angler. A better read for one looking for the angle of life."
5,Excellent,"Being a baby-boomer and a novice flyfisher, I identified with the author since I went through some of the same experiences as he did, such as divorce and the loss of close friends. I gave it five stars."
3,Not a bad read. Too much political bias.,"Howell Raines' ""Fly Fishing Through the Mid Life Crisis"" is a pretty good read full of the wisdom of fly fishing, friendship and coming to terms with one's mortality. He also gives a brief history of fly fishing in New England with some of the greats of the sport like Bob Closuer and Lefty Kreh. It was an enjoyable read but could have been just as good without his political commentary. I could have done without his endless praise of past Democratic Presidents and disdain for the Republic ones. It has a definite liberal bias that took away form the main point of the text, the joy of the pursuit of fly fishing and how it made his life better. I would rate it a six on a scale of ten."
2,Fly fishing through a self-induced sense of knowledge.,"The book's central goal is admirable, but is marred by the author's inability to recognize that he does not have all the answers. As a result, one is left with the clear view that Raines is a self-righteous windbag. For example, he proclaims the northern outpost of the redneck way of fishing ends in Maryland. Guess this not-it-all has not been to northern PA. or parts of the Midwest. In spite of this, the fishing stories are entertaining. Their impact is muted, however, for all but the rich, liberal fly fisher because of the author's politics being injected in the book. This makes the book more useful for the feel-good liberal, rather than the sincere fly-fisherman. Judge you tolerance for this, and get it if you are one of these types."
2,Not my style...sorry,A coworker of mine let me borrow this book to read...because he knew I liked fly fishing books. I think I could have very easily put this book down and not finished reading it. I really do not care to spend my free time reading about politics but it's 4 degrees outside and my flyline keeps freezing to the ground so I decided to continue on. What I found was an author who learns how to come to terms with his mortality through the death of a close friend. I think if he had listened to his preacher as a child instead of shunning him he might not have wasted so much of his life fearing death. If you're looking for a book to help solve your mid-life crisis I wouldnt read this book. Try reading the Bible. I'm giving this book 1 star because it's a flyfishing book and another star for the recipes which I may try some day.
1,Better spend your time fishing than reading this,"This book seems to split people into 2 camps - either you love it or hate it. I was told it was one of those 'must read' books, a seminal tome. In fact I found it grossly self indulgent, over sentimental and boring - I struggled to get through it in the hope that something of interest would appear. It didn't."
5,politically correct fly fishing,"It is hard to believe that I could ever be this positive about someone who is a leftist, liberal news editor like Howell Raines. But the truth is, Mr. Raines has written an outstanding bookthat is highly recommended to *anyone*, flyfisher(wo)man or not!An added bonus are the fish recipes scattered throughout, mm mm good!"
3,Midlife crisis of a fly fishing liberal,"Really good fishing stories which are ,unfortunately, injected with liberal politics. Why did he have to do that? Apparently he doesn't know that people fish to get away from things like politics.Would have been close to a 5 rating without the political stuff."
2,Fishing or Politics?,"A friend of mine lent me this book to read. I made it about 2/3 of the way through and had to put it down for good. Although the books is well written, engaging, and interesting, Raines can't stay away from launching political barbs. (I think many of us will all agree that Hoover was a poor president, but Raines can't keep from repeatedly driving that point home. It gives one the impression as though Hoover had it out for Raines' own family.) I'm not sure what all that has to do with fly fishing. His inability to keep his politics seperate from any other aspect of his life is quite obvious in the content of the NY Times, which he is now the Editor in Chief. If you're looking for a light read about the adventures of fly fishing, I recommend Harry Middleton or John Gierach."
1,Fly Fishing Through the Midlife Crisis Review by Gregg Bates,"The author uses this book to launch early-on into his LIBERAL and LEFT political leanings.Not what I was looking for when I bought the book. I am glad that he did it early-on though, so I could toss the book and pick-up a Gierach book in it's place.Thanks,Gregg Bates"
5,The instruction book that should have come with our kids!,"I never experienced boudaries in my home growing up so this book has been an eye-opener for me. I have been looking for a book to change the dysfunction my family has passed down for generations. This book is exactly what I have been looking for in regards to practical suggestions that are based on love, the Bible, and raising a happy, emotionally healthy child. I highly recommend!"
4,Common sense mixed with the right amount of faith,"The authors make it seem SO easy, but it probably isn't that hard. With some logical, sensible methods to controlling emotions and setting (and enforcing!) limits, Boundaries with Kids is a great resource. I actually thought about using a quarterback-style wristband to write down some of the ideas so I can reference them in certain situations..."
4,Boundaries for kids,It is an excellent book with excellent examples on child rearing. The company I got it from sent in promptly and I've had no hassles. Very pleased overall.
4,Good Companion Study,"The book, ""Boundaries with Kids"" is a real help to parents and Sunday School Teachers. Using this workbook while studying, whether classroom or individual, was found to be very helpful. We have had three ladies in our Church complete this study, and two more are considering it; using the workbook with the book. All input has been positive."
3,"Good Advice, Annoying Bible References","The advice given in the book was good, and a lot of good points were made, but I found the constant references to the Bible very annoying. I am not a religious person, and wouldn't have minded a few references, but it was a little too much for my liking. It read more like a sermon, and I didn't realize that when I had purchased it."
3,Just OK,"I finished reading the book in no time. There are several interesting stories in this book. However, many opinions listed in this book are just common sense to me."
2,"Confusing, over complicates things",This book has good points but the questions tend to ask a lot of abstract questions. I also don't like the fact that it over complicates simple issues.There are better books about parenting out there.
5,God sent help,"I wish I came across this book sooner. It is full of infos about children, their habits, their way of thinking, their behavior, their can and can't, and lots more. My husband and I really did not know what to do with our seven year old daughter. Some issues were so difficult to deal with, especially they were constantly repetitive. I went to a consoler to seek out help. After listening to me, she suggested this book. I reluctantly bought it at Amazon. I immediately put to practice what it suggested and I saw immediate changes with all of us. My parenting is no more inconsistent, guilt driven, argumentative, bargaining, exhaustive any more. They choose the behavior, they receive the consequences; weather good or bad.The book also explains the kids "" I can't do it"" and their "" I'm the boss"" attitude.I love this book, I think every parent in the whole world should read it and put it to practice. We would have a promising next generation.DL"
4,Insightful and extremely helpful in dealing with kids.,"This is a must read book for anyone that wants to raise not just nice children, but responsible caring individuals. It taught me how to instill responsiblity in my children and gave me the verbal responses I needed to stop nagging and still get the job done.It has really changed the way I am raising my children today."
2,"Some good points, but would recommend ""The Explosive Child"" instead.","I thoroughly liked the general adult version of ""Boundaries"", but did not like this book as much. Many great points throughout the book, such as how parents can and should avoid extreme anger and manipulating behavior when disciplining their children, but I feel a much better overall approach to dealing with challenging behavior in children can be found in a book called ""The Explosive Child"", but Dr. Ross Greene. ""The Explosive Child"" is great for parents of all children, but can be especially helpful for those dealing with severely challenging children. This book has changed my entire paradigm of how to relate to children. Though Dr. Greene's book is not written from a Christian viewpoint, it might as well be! It is very in line with mainstream Christian principles - more so than many books marketed as ""Christian parenting"" information in my opinion."
5,Great resource for Christian parenting!,This book helped me to see that implementing scripture pricipals into parenting makes life so much easier. It was encouranging and convicting at the same time. First got it from the library and then had to buy it so I could reference it over and over.
4,Great read for all ages of children,I have already put into place some ideas from this book. My daughters really understood the judge idea as it was presented. I would recommend this to any parent.
5,Above Expectations,"The product was exactly what I wanted and is in new condition as stated. I ordered the book from this seller in the am on one day and received it the next day in the mail.As for the book, I have already read it and wanted a copy to keep at home for a reference, The book helps with your kids and helps the parent as well.I highly recommend it and ordering from this seller."
1,Better to stick to the bread,"The portions of this book that deal with the Great Harvest bread company and its franchisees are fascinating. However, the long stretches of pointless prose about the author's quest to find himself merit a quick skim. This book felt self-indulgent, something Great Harvest franchisees certainly can't be to stay in business."
4,Recipe For A Successful Life,This book Brea And Butter by Tom McMakin is an excellent way of looking at life. The most amazing thing about this book was how successful each person who joined the Great Harvest Company was. With each person working only 40 hours per week even the CEO and Managers. It's a wounderful recipe for life and a key to being happy and succesful with whatever profession you choose. Regardless if it's not the Business World.
3,What a Report can teach you?,"I was told to pick this book from a list for my government class. At first I was reluctant to read this book, I thought it would be a snoozer, but it really turned out to be an interesting book. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to start their own business or that already has a business.This book teaches the buisness owner how to treat and respect their customer as a friend."
4,Great tips and delicious bread...,"For anyone who is interested in starting their own business, this is the book for you. Tom McMakin provides helpful tips, coming from real people. He sets great guidelines how to run a successful business and lead a happy life for you and your workers."
3,Balancing Work and Life to Achieve Happines,"Tom McMakin is a great storyteller. His story of Great Harvest Bread Company is not just one of business but it is also a book about life. He sets down a plan for balancing both work and life in order to achieve happinees. Do you feel that your work is running your life? Then this is a book for you. Discover how to let your bussiness help you, and not vice versa! But beware, you must be ready to look up a Great Harvest store near you and purchase some great bread!!!"
2,Check this one out from a library,"If you are interested in the Great Harvest story, this is a good book. Not a great book. The most interesting reading is the excerpts from newletters written by Pete Wakeman. You can get a feeling for Pete's style for free on the Great Harvest website."
3,Valuable advice on living a balanced life,"The philosophy in Tom McMakin's book can be summarized in one sentence: to be successful and to achieve a state of mental equilibrium, live a balanced life.This seems like commonly accepted advice. Yet it is not commonly practiced in the modern world. Pete and Laura Wakeman, founders of Great Harvest, taught McMakin that striving for success by working long hours, shunning vacations, keeping long to-do lists, and cramming as much into each work hour as possible may lead to financial success, but at a superficial level.Deeper success, McMakin writes, comes from entering the ""zone,"" or mental state where one observes life as one would watch a flowing river. At this intuitive level, one sees more clearly, identifies problems, and finds solutions that would have been by-passed in the workaholic lifestyle described above.The book is well worth reading, especially the chapter from Pete Wakeman's ""Newsletter #46."""
4,"makes me want to eat bread, and work for myself!","Tom's done a great job of presenting Great Harvest's story - and his own - in an interesting, accessible way. A personally connecting book - makes me want to both eat good bread, and have my work make the world a better place!"
4,Bread and Butter,"I enjoyed this book. Although McMakin could have been a bit more concise, his excitement and passion for the Great Harvest Bread Co. kept me reading. The values he preaches are refreshing, and I would recommend it to anyone going into business for themselves."
4,What a learning experiance,"Wow I thought that this book was great! It waswel written from a buisness man's poit of viw, and Ilearned a lot, since I want to be something in the feild of buisness. This book is especally good for people who like this sort of thing... It teache yo to love your proffesion which makes you better at it."
2,Not acceptable quality,The pearls were not well strung and looked like something that could be picked up in a dimestore (if they existed anymore). I returned them. The only good thing is Amazon's excellent return policy -- easy and quick and courteous.
3,was not bad.. feels more like spandex (loose though) than mesh,was hoping for something a little better like other mesh shirts as the material here is more like polyester or spandex.. but it does the job and fit well.
4,Amazing,"I had always loved Ralegh's poetry, I fell enamored of the fictional account of his life entitled ""Death of a Fox"" by George Garrett some 30 odd years ago, but had never really comprehended the sweep of Ralegh's life. In his own way, according to Lacey, Ralegh's household became almost the equivalent of our Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Draper Labs, or even NASA. The story about the cloak and Elizabeth is true, but the depth of his love for his wife was new to me.Fascinating, well-written book. Truly fascinating man."
2,should have paid more attention to the reviews here,"It's a great looking monitor. I'm not an expert so I can't compare the quality of the image, it looks good to me.Problems are the constant buzz and the height adjustment, which were both mentioned here.The monitor is way too bright, and when you reduce the brightness a constant, very annoying buzz starts. With all the noise in an office environment, it may not be a problem, but at home, where it's silent, this bugs me a lot.The height is not adjustable and very low. The other reviewer is spot on, it's not usable as is, my neck started hurting in couple of days. How can they miss this? no idea."
4,"Nice looking, great price, good choice for 20 inch wide monitor","First of all, this is not a monitor for professionals. It has some disadvantages, maybe the picture isn't 100% sharp (I'm most complaining on the text, somehow blurry), but for home needs it's more than OK.It's very well designed and will look great on your desk. Also, for 250$ you'll get 20inch, wide screen, (for example great for movies if you play them on your PC)Brightness is great. Also what I always liked about Samsung monitors is it's colors (great for photos too.)All in all this is not a perfect monitor but for ordinary home use it's great - I love it ."
2,another case of buzzing sound,i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness (<100%). just scheduled an exchange LCD.
2,A sheep in wolfs clothing,"Yes, this monitor has all the big tech numbers, whatever they mean. To me, that doesn't mean squat when it's not pleasing to the eye. The colors on the screen are not consistent; it's brighter on the bottom then on the top. If you look at it while moving your head up and down, you'll see it change. That's why you get a difference when you're looking at it straight on. The new, cheaper TN panels they're using have a different viewing angle than previous ones. A lot of the monitors the electronics stores sell are of this type. The display models are deceiving, because they run a video loop that makes the picture look beautiful. But, when you get it home and start running your apps on it, that's when you start seeing the flaws. Also, this model has an annoying blinking, blue light when it's in sleep mode."
5,Quality Monitor,"This monitor is quite a good buy at this price. It works well and has a beautiful picture. Black light bleeding is minimal on my unit. The entire picture is clear and bright. Also, I experience no ghosting while playing games. The only issue I had was with some mechanical buzzing coming from the monitor while viewing dark things such as websites and some games. I did what one other reviewer suggested and tightened my power and DVI connectors and the noise stopped. The other issue I have is the blue power LEDs are quite bright, but that problem is solved by simply turning off the monitor when it is not in use. Overall these small problems were not enough for me to lower my rating of the product."
3,bogus reviewer ALERT,"PAID HACK: ""Roy Givens III""...is obviously an employee of Sirius, all of his 8 reviews are designed to run down XM radio and promote Sirius. What a pitiful, brainlessly-obvious fake. Surely Amazon can do a better job of screening out goons like this, otherwise the credibility of its users' reviews will continue to plummet.Me, I own nor use neither system, just wanted to post this as a heads-up for unsuspecting Amazon users, so I'm giving it 3 stars as a neutral rating."
3,I have taken this a few times,"I took it a couple of times, and there was no significant boost of energy, but then I havent been very tired either, so it keeps you going at a good balanced level"
1,wat?,this has nothing to do with pokemon!all it is is a pokemon pikachu printed on a spray bottle and the box!simply pointless.a waste of money.
5,A fun way to do math,"Like all of Greg Tang's other math books, he takes math problems, sets them to rhyme, and gets your kids solving math problems. He gives a clue in the rhyme to help kids organize their counting patterns, and then the counting begins. The art work in his books is vibrant, bold, and fun. For example, he has children counting chili peppers in red and green hues while the opposite page has a cactus mariachi band playing at sunset. He's got partying peapods and a singing clam to help you count star fish. He also throws in some facts about the items you are counting (example--""with little suction cups for feet..."" used for the starfish or ""they somehow know to make a V, instead of flying randomly..."" for the geese) which add a nice touch to his book. This is a fun way to teach kids about math and groupings without doing rote math facts."
1,Goodness how sad.,"This is the first experience I have had of the Amazon ""Search Inside"" marketing ploy. What a pity the publishers (I am assuming that they were the ones who selected the extracts) were so concerned about not divulging the contents of the book, that they completely failed to further my initial interest which was bordering on excitemnt.Publishers, please make sure that whoever selects the 'Search Inside' extracts of a book you are promoting is knowledgeable enough to attract potential buyers."
4,I used a tool to translate the Spanish review. . .,"Here is the translation for the Spanish review:This equipment is innovating, of very good quality, with many functions as he is reader of DVD and the power to see in your own vehiculo with any screen the channels of your local zone"
1,A Nightmare on Transfer Street,"I just bought this in June of 2007. Downloaded great but could not get the 'preview' to work. Technical support had me to download an 'upgrade' to it 2 days after I bought it. So it was already out of date when I got it. Now the USB does not connect to the program. I have been trying to get technical support to straighten this out for me since I bought it 2 weeks ago and still cannot get it to work. Unless you are a computer genious and know how to out smart this thing , please be careful in buying this. I have yet to be able to use it."
3,Uneven Quality,"The entertainment value is great, but be aware that several episodes appear to have been recorded from CBN or some other network, then transferred to DVD."
3,Not what I expected but enjoyable,"I was surprised that several episodes were really old!! I had no idea that there were several actors that played Blanche's husband, Harry. The older episodes weren't as entertaining: First episode is obviously set up like a play on stage. The constant Carnation Milk promotions throughout several episodes got on my nerves. However it was interesting to see the transition from very old to newer episodes. A bit of ""Burns and Allen"" history so I'm glad to have it.The Burns and Allen act is still funny!I was extremely pleased with the seller. The DVD arrived at my house much sooner than expected!"
2,George and Gracie,"If you're a real George and Gracie fan, then this is not the video for you. I was really disappointed. There are far better Burns and Allen shows that could have easily been reproduced. There were some skits that used to bowl me over and all the sigments in this video do not even come close."
3,The good ol' days!,"Burns and Allen were quite funny both on radio and early television. I've always had a hard time accepting the charatcter ""Gracie"", as she portrays herself as being the simpleton. I've always liked George Burns as he can make you smile, if not laugh altogether. Of the three dvd's I recently purchased, this would rate 3rd."
4,Excellent performance.. too much requirements,"This is an excellent product indeed, in terms of performace. Its fast, its great.. but its requirements are too much demanding, with 450 watt as a minimum and 625 watts as recommended isn't the least of your concerns. They require a 12v/30a power supply, and if you find one.. you'll be lucky if it even has PCI-connectors.Overall, installing it is a pain in the a**, but once that is done.. its great.. if you don't mind the electricity bill."
3,OTHERWORLDLY,"You don't have to pop a pill, chew nasty fungus or snort anything up your nose to feel like you are trippin' a mile above earth... this CD will do it for you. All I can say is CCCCCRRREEEEEEPPPPPYYYY.... I am not sure if I like it yet, I got it yesterday so I will have to listen more. CD2 is more appealing to my taste.Talk about dark. They should have called it After AFTER hours. It goes from lazy, to a sort of dramatic mourning feel, then a little sexiness... and for the most part the whole thing just sounds kind of EVIL. I just picture someone laying on the floor in a drug haze, spiraling down the rabbit hole. Either that or people sitting at 8AM in silence at a club with a wicked grin, bobbing to the beat.It is definitely unique... totally moody tunes...I would borrow it from a friend before you buy though to make sure it is something you would dig.It also comes with a clubbing DvD which is pretty fun. I love watching and listening."
2,"Should be called ""come-down""","Warning - this album set is VERY VERY chill. Spacy, ambient and minimal. The DVD seems to be a lot of what looks like ""stock"" footage looped and pulsed to the beat. Very stroby. I say play the DVD video but listen to something else for audio. The CD's themselves would be best suited when you're trying to fall asleep after a long night/morning of partying. Lot's of tracks, but each one is fairly short."
2,"Some good tracks, but the mixing is not very good.","Johnny 'Fiasco' Lopez is one of my favorite house producers and I own quite a few of his records, but this mix cd disappoints me. A couple parts of the mix are mixed decently, but the overall mixing/programming is kinda sloppy. +4 for the tracks that are on the cd, -2 for the mixing... +2 overall"
4,Loaded to the max!,"There are five tracks in this remix EP, all of Loaded, the third single off the Sound Loaded album. It didn't go too far up the charts which is a pity because the song really is very catchy and you will definitely be hooked after a few listens.The first track is the best remix version and really, it's all you need to get down and boogie. The rest are, well, more suited for the dance floor, although diehard Ricky Martin fans will beg to differ.Don't concentrate too much on the lyrics, it's really quite trivial, but hey, it's pop music, not the Star Spangled Banner.So enjoy it, I know you will."
5,rhythm loaded,loaded is filled with traditional and modern rhythmic drive.you can only feel rejuvenated after experiencing LOADED!
3,THE COMPARISON TO MICHAEL HEDGES IS OBVIOUS AND TRUE!,"A very soothing CD by a newcomer. The music has a flavor of early Michael Hedges, but none of the ""edge"" that made Hedges so wonderful. Lurssen doesn't take any musical chances (maybe because he's young, maybe because he doesn't want to offend)and in not doing so, he does the listener a dis-service. You have to LISTEN to this CD-the music does not come to you, and thus, it is quite easy to have the whole disc play through when the sudden realization comes that you heard none of it. I wouldn't recommend this cD to someone who is just getting into acoustic artists, but it is a nice addition to an acoustic lover's library. Would like to hear Gavin in about 5 years when he has more life under his frets."
4,Happy cats,"Well-written book, easy to understand instructions and pictures. My cats instantly relaxed when I tried a few of the Touches. We now do 5 minutes a night, and they look forward to it."
4,"You have heard of the word, now see the movie ""Kismet""","""Kismet"" is an Arabian Nights fantasy about Hafiz (Ronald Colman), a scheming beggar in the court of the Caliph (James Craig), who wins the hand of the dancing girl (Marlene Dietrich), the mistress of Mansur, the Grand Vizier (Edward Arnold). There are all sorts of palace intrigues going on, but Hafiz has an edge because knows magic. This 1944 film, directed by William Dieterle, cost $3,000,000, which was considered by many to be extravagant given the wartime shortages. ""Kismet"" had been filmed three times previously and while it is a luscious production, the main problem is, surprisingly enough, the two stars. Colman is not well suited to this particular role and Dietrich does not really have much to do besides dance and look good. Not that there is anything wrong with that. The musical version, featuring the song ""Stranger in Paradise,"" was filmed in 1955. It is a toss-up as to which one is better."
1,bad copy,"This is a very bad copy, like a copy from some VHS tape. I could have done it better myself, because I've got a better version of this film on a video-cassette somewhere."
4,Ronald Colman does comedy,"I adore Ronald Colman in ""Random Harvest"" with Greer Garson and in ""Talk of the Town"" with Jean Arthur and Cary Grant. ""Kismet"" was certainly a change of pace, but not in a bad way. I admit I don't know if I enjoyed the movie more on its own merits or to watch Ronald Colman play such a different character. Marlene Dietrich as Colman's love interest didn't quite work for me, but all in all, an enjoyable romp."
2,The shame of Marlene,In this picture Marlene looks stupid. The costumes and the dance are silly. The story is not original and the script is bad. Only the colors are good. Just for Marlene's lovers.
5,FREE PDF of this book in French and German online...,"No one wants to pay the ridiculous price of $200+ for any book. I looked online and found a PDF of it relatively easily by doing a Google search. The ENTIRE book is available to download for FREE through File Factory: filefactory (dot)com(forward slash)file (forward slash)cd4aacf (forward slash)n (forward slash)MadrigalFrench (dot)pdf. It does work and you do not have to sign up for a paid membership. It took about 20 minutes to download the whole book on my netbook. This book is unavailable anywhere for under $100 but can be found in some libraries. I have only glanced at it but it is different from anything else I have ever seen. I have a multitude of French learning materials but this approach is something very different. I should have waited to post a review until I read the book, but I wanted to make sure the info was available to anyone interested. I was offended by the $200+ price gouging and felt it necessary to provide this asap."
1,Be careful this is a rip-off,"The product description is a case of 24 bottles. They send you 1 bottle and claim that "" Amazon mis-describes it"" Oh yes, like a single 4 oz. bottle actually lists for $65.85."
4,Rock 'n Roll...,"It is pretty good home theater, 6 channel. I did not need the recorder but it came with it. I wish it has better equalizer system but it looks slick and works great.ThanksHobi"
1,Waste of paper and money!,"After having wasted the ingredients to make *five* different recipes from this book, the results of the last attempt, along with the book, are going into the trash. No wonder this book was remaindered! Following the recipes to the letter, I have gotten dry, heavy loaves of bread that were nearly impossible to cut, let alone eat. I used all fresh ingredients, including yeast. When using the recipes in the book that came with my bread machine, I always get excellent results. Love the idea of healthy bread machine recipes. It would be nice if someone would write one!"
2,A bit disappointing,"I have her first book and this one, and I must say that she must be running out of good recipes. These are mostly disappointing."
3,"Modern Navigation, Guidance, and Control Processing","This text has alot of good and useful information although it probably could be better organized. One issue I take with the author is that he references other books in the series throughout his text as having much more detailed information on topics (e.g., ""discussion on the stability analysis of a guidance loop is discussed in the first book of the series""). Where are the other books. There are 5 books identified but only two have been published. I purchased Volume II and would like Volume I but as far as I can tell it still does not exist! Volume II was published in 1991! Will Volume II ever be published (i.e., Modeling, Design,Analysis, and Simulation of NGC Systems)? In the software business marketing practices such as this were called ""vaporware."" I know alot of other folks in my industry who would be interested in purchasing some of the other books that are supposed to be part of this series."
2,Skip this & read Riddlemaster again,"When McKillip's good, she's very very good, and when she's bad it comes out like this. As in many of her other books, McKillip deals with mysterious characters who live on the edge between reality and dream. However, here she errs by making the character who should be mysterious her narrator. This makes all Roisin's eccentric behavior (slipping off into the forest to commune with the brook, that sort of thing) seem like a pose. A real child of nature, living by instinct, wouldn't be writing this book; a narrator, by definition, has to be self-conscious, and Roisin shouldn't be. It's too bad, because this could have been a good one if told from a different point of view."
4,Solid Fantasy,"This was the first novel that I've read by Patricia McKillip. I will certainly be returning to her. Winter Rose is a thrilling and complex fantasy told in an amazingly original and fresh style. The story of Rois fighting her way through a frozen world she doesn't really understand is captivating. The complex relationships between the well developed characters are fascinating. I most enjoyed McKillip's poetic prose style. Winter Rose is a quick, thought provoking, and satisfying read, and I do hope McKillip's other works are as good."
4,Poetic and Spellbinding,"The best way to read this book is curled up against an oven, with a nice cup of tea at your side and a torrential storm battering at the windows. This is a beautiful, elegant and lyrical book. It might not have a very original plot(it is actually a very loose retelling of the Tam Lin ballad) and the characters are rather two-dimensional but the beautiful and lyrical language saves the book. McKillip's language is evocative and sensuous; drowning roses and a love beyond time and space.There are many books that bear the label""fantasy"". Very few of them convey any of the power, majesty and wonder that is thetrue mark of the Sidhe.I have not seen anyone do it as well as Patricia McKillip. Winter Rose: buy it, read it, be spellbound."
2,confusing and lacking info,"I thought that Winter Rose was just a piece of confusing mumbo jumbo. It's hard to recognize whether Rois is dreaming or in reality because sometimes the author doesn't state the fact that Rois is conscious or not. There are other reasons that made the plot hard to follow. The characters didn't give enough information on this ""other world"" that Corbet came from. How did it form? Is Nial, Corbet, and the ""witch"" the only inhabitants? Also, the ending leaves too much questions. Does Corbet still love Laurel? What does Rois feel? How did Corbet escape from the other world? Finally, the narrator, Rois, was too mysterious. The point of view should have been in third person, not the wild wood-child. Some of the discriptions by Rois was skimpy and perplexing.Though I love fantasy (and this book is definitely fantasy), Winter Rose was just too weird and puzzling for me to really like and understand the book."
3,"Beautiful, but forgettable","This is so embarrassing, but this will be the third time I've read this novel and I still cannot remember a thing about it. I just keeping buying it and forgetting that I read it!The writing is beautiful as can be expected from Patricia, but the story is painfully forgettable and uninteresting."
1,THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE,"Okay I would first like to start by saying that I am an avid reader, who enjoys many types of books (even though i'm only 14). Okay so here's the scoop- this book was terrible. First off, the main character was OBSESSED with the man and it was absolutley confusing to the point of annoying that you didn't know what the heck he was. I was EXTREMELY disapointed because i had just finished reading a VERY good book by this author, In The Forest Of Serre (this i recommend). Also, the plot was so repetitive, i couldn't even finish the darn book! And i'm glad i didn't because i read the ending and it was horrible."
2,Potential without substance,"Sigh. This book had so much potential. McKillip had a wonderful, engaging main character in Rois. In fact her characterisation in general was wonderful. And the basis for a plot was undeniably there. But it just didn't develop. It was vague and gossamer like, and at the end I was so sorry, because I could have loved it if it was a little more substantial, but it was so airy it fell flat."
5,FINE BOOKS BY ROY CROSS,"A fine companion piece to Roy's ""The Celebration of Flight"" If one loves the sea and the sky you'll find these books very important to your library.Dave Paulley"
4,Fuji 4Q spray,"The spray is a qood choice, however two new design should be addded to it. First, there should be a holder for spray, second the short flexible tube should be redesign at the endd so that it does not tear apart easl."
2,Digital Logic,"I had to purchase this book for a Digital Logic class i am taking. I am not very happy with the book since it does not cover concepts in detail (with examples in the text) instead it has questions at the end of the chapter but they do not offer the solutions in the book or online so it makes it difficult to know if you are understanding and getting the questions correct. It also jumps around in the chapters, no chapter is stand alone for a specific area."
3,Good,I received the book in reasonably good condition ...The delivery was prompt and i received the book within 2 weeks . I am looking forward to buying more books from the same vendor
2,A text ANALOGOUS in nature;,"As i was researching for a project, i found this text ""Contemporary Logic Design"" to be very similar in concept and examples to its predecessors (texts published by other authors). Most notable examples were from Dr. Mono's text ""Degital Design"" and other similar texts. In my opinion there exists much better texts in the market."
3,Satisfying and listenable.,"I find Twitch to be a satisfying album from Aldo Nova. Twitch is in a pop rock direction. It doesn't have the slight progressive edge that Subject has, though. Aldo Nova does well with the vocals, and the album is tight and energetic. It contains a total of ten tracks, and the musicianship, songwriting, and production are good. I also like the combination of guitar and keyboard playing--there's a nice dose of both. My favorite song is the ballad ""Surrender Your Heart."" It's got nice synth playing and backing vocals. Another tune that I like is ""Long Hot Summer."" The last track on the album is an instrumental called ""Twitch."" It features cool guitar and keyboard playing. Every track on this album is good. Worth a listen."
4,SHOOTING STAR...,"Many people may say that Aldo's first release was his best...but in my opinion this is the definitive Nova! The songs are all stronger here and so are the vocals...Why this album was not a smash sales wise is beyond me, and must go down in history as one of lifes great mysteries (together with lack of chart success for Angel). Every song is perfectly crafted AOR, with stella musicianship (a trade mark of this great artist). Listen to the magestic glory of ""Surrender Your Heart"", ""Fallen Angel"" and ""Stay"" and you'll know what I mean! ""Lay Your Love On Me"" is worthy of a mention purely for striking similarities to the great masked marauders Kiss with ""Heaven's On Fire."" My recommendation would be that if you can buy any Aldo Nova CD start here and then get the rest...cause at the end of the day all releases by this great man will satisfy! Where are you Aldo? I keep looking towards the skies!"
3,Good Songwriting,"Aldo writes some good pop songs and this album is no disappointment. I wasn't as thrilled with this release as I was his first two, but it still holds up and isn't a disappointment really. ""Surrender Your Heart"" is a great song and so is the infectious ""Long Hot Summer."" Aldo is a great songwriter and musician and his music is cool to listen to."
2,Still love those first 2 songs!,"""Twitch"" (1985) did not chart.3rd and final album I bought by Aldo Nova. The 1-2 punch of ""Tonight (Lift Me Up)"" and ""Rumours Of You"", still resonate today 26 years later, both of these songs should of been big hits. ""Surrender Your Heart"", is a nice power ballad done with Fiona who made 4 albums between 1985-1992, and had a hit in ""Talk to Me"" in '85. As for the rest of the album, I found out it was a little to slick and just a tad boring, nothing like his first albums."
4,Aldo's 3rd cut album Twitch.,"Another great song writing by Aldo. His music hasn't changed much since his first album Fantasy. If you are a rock music lover as I, then you'll love Aldo Nova. He's one of few original musician who creates his own unique style with wonderful soul touching melodies of synths in his music. it's sad that he didn't get the credit he really deserved. Personally, If I was with a record company, I'd wouldn't watse not 1 second to lose Aldo to sign the record contract for another decae at least. I am very picky when it comes to rock musicians. And I must say, Aldo is one of my favorite."
1,Don't waste your money,"I originally believed that this book would provide some valuable insight into the rise of Texas politicians. What I got, however,was a rehash of newspaper articles that are all available online. It is upsetting to me to have to write a negative review, but I must. As I was reading, I longed for a meaty, insider account that this author promised. He doesn't deliver. All in all, this book is a missed opportunity (in a major way). I hope this author will stay away from the newspaper files and do some original research in the future. Save your money."
5,Will this release be at the right speed and pitch???,"Well, it's nice to see that ""The Archie Show"" is being re-released after it's original release in 2007. However, this release will only be a partial release as compared to the entire series being released in 2007. But the MAIN QUESTION IS...Did they remaster the episodes at the right speed and pitch this time? The boxset released in 2007 was 4% too fast due to the PAL to NTSC conversion as the original film elements were digitized in PAL format in the UK, and then converted to NTSC for release in the USA. Those that were very familiar with the series, including myself, immediately noticed that the voices were too high... especially noticeable in the song segments. So here is hoping that this has been fixed for this re-release. Guess we'll find out on May 10th."
4,Archies are still very cool.,"Brings back alot of memories from Saturday morning cartoons, to the comics I used to own & read of the Archies. Very cool."
3,Genius trumps painful recording,"3 1/2Despite, or perhaps even because of all the sound quality snares running rampant over a general piss-poor production, Parker & Miles will remain as memorable as the ever-skipping, static-discharging history of audio recording itself. Undoubtedly the rough sounding disc can be credited to an outstanding partnership of two obvious giants who could do more coasting on autopilot then most accomplish in a musical lifetime. Between the shoddy production (which casual fans should rightfully steer clear of) lies a vast summation of nearly the entire genre's history and it's explosive future to come."
1,Zero Stars,"If I could give this album zero stars, I would. I bought this record a few years ago and have only listened to it once because it is awful. First, there is a constant buzz that will make you want to kill yourself throughout the entire record and the sound quality is quite subpar. Second, most of the track names are heinously erroneous. The first track is really ""Night In Tunisia"" and track six is really ""Quasimodo"" for instance. As a result of buying this album, I am boycotting all CDs published by Delta and LazerLight Digital. If you need an inexpensive introduction to Bird, buy the ""Best of"" from the Ken Burns series. Better yet, trust me and buy the immortal ""Bird and Diz"" with Thelonious Monk, Curly Russel and Buddy Rich making up the rhythm section. In any case, don't waste your money on this embarassing album."
5,Great Music,The music included in this CD has so much variety. It was used as a background CD for a dinner party. Very enjoyable!
3,Light Duty Only,"Tight fit for my two scoped rifles. The sides were slightly bent when the case is closed. Because my rifles were heavy, the handle came off at the range when I lifted the case up from the left side because it is press fitted in. I secured it with a wire to prevent this from happening in the future. OK for light duty like 22LR, but would avoid for anything more heavy duty."
5,Awesome Case,This case is awesome. Holds both of my rifles with room to spare! I will end up buying at least one more.
5,Great Case,"This was purchased for trap shooting. Very sturdy case and keeps the guns secure while in transit. It works out great. Holds two shotguns with 28"" barrel."
3,Many Corners Cut,"I don't care if $60 is on the low end of gun cases, Plano could have spared 10 cents to glue their foam padding into the case, rather than have it fall out every time you open it. Furthermore, I wasn't able to fit two rifles in there, let alone with scopes (it was an M-4 with Aimpoint on one side, a Remington M700 with 3-9x40 on the other). Returned to Amazon."
1,Do not buy,Had my guns fall out several times due to poor hindge-locks. Need a better quality latching system than plastic for a good gun.
2,Barely fits two guns,I was really hoping this case would work out for me but it will barely even close with two separate guns in it.
2,Ok,"Double gun case, but not thick enough for two guns. I can barely close it and have to force it down to clamp the locks."
5,Solid case for the price,"Was looking for double case to take on a hunting trip on the airline. This is a solid case with the ""pillar"" design offering good support. The mulitple latches make closing secure."
2,Plano double sided case,"Once opened it is not as rigid as the description makes it out to be. Airline approved: if it has latches and locks. That is all that is required. In this case is two pieces of think SOFT foam. I bought this for my AR and Mosin Nagant Carbine. I will be going to spend MORE money for foam. The foam is not glued in this case. This case should go for around $30.I am a veteran, not that it matters, I expected more as per description. I REALLY need this case. That is the ONLY reason I will not return it. Save your money and order something else."
3,OK for the price,Lets just say for the price its not bad but a bit flimsy. I have a scoped Gamo Whisper pellet gun (just fits)and Rem 870 shot gun both placed inside case.The case splits open with 4 foam (2 per side) pieces to protect your guns. I bit of a challenge to close and get everything lined up just right. Once closedthere are many latches including end caps to secure it tight. I believe this case would pass TSA inspection for there are four(4)lock points where you can slipa padlock through. Overall not bad but to get better you would have to commit to spending a lotta bucks.
3,Captivating but with large holes.,"A book on the basics naturally cannot cover everything but the basics, and thus, this one left me wondering about the glaring untouched areas the author couldn't cover. For example, what do you do when the position of your house is exactly the opposite of what she recommends? It would be all but impossible to turn your house around, and nearly as unrealistic to move, but she offers no solution to this fundamental problem. Yet, the author turned the complicated subject into an interesting and easy read."
1,Disjointed and impossible to follow,"I bought three books on this subject and this was by far the worst. Her thoughts seem disjointed and random. In many cases, when she speaks of negative chi reguarding house orientation or surroundings, she offers no solution. I guess she expects us to move."
1,Wrong product for discription,"I ordered these sights and got the wrong color, not once but twice. Hard to rate the product because when you order, there is a glitch in the item # or the people that package the item. I am convinced that if I order a third time, it will still be wrong.Beware of ordering these sights. Im sure if you get the right ones, they will rate high."
4,"A provocative, tell all, history of interesting events","The author has written an accurate, uncommonly revealing, biographical documentary. Having served in the military I do not approve of Adkisson's MO (modus operandi) during his earlier years, particularly while in a liberty status outside the boundaries of a military installation, and I question the basis upon which some of his more seasoned considerations and decisions came into play later in his military career. I found the book entertaining in that Adkisson invariably came out smelling like a rose regardless of the appropriateness or inappropriateness of his activities. The youth of today's military would achieve very little success were they to attempt following Adkisson's lead as their role model however I do believe they would thoroughly enjoy reading of his experiences."
5,"A book that ""tells it like it is"" in the Navy.","An unequaled, incredibly accurate, biographical history of one's naval career that divulges, for the most part, those things that remain carefully guarded secrets to most men and women who have served."
4,"Great disc, even though some tracks sound dated.","Most of the tracks resonate even in 2002, but others (e.g., ""Hanging on a Heartbeat"") have a decidedly 1980's feel. ""Where Have the Children Gone"" remains an underrated Hooters' effort."
2,Regulator leaks- danger,"I have owned the grill for a few years...true enough...But now the regulator is leaking- explosive and dangerous.Getting parts has proved to be impossible. YOu can get a generic regulator but Char-Broil was too cheap to get screw on type connections. They are connected with a permanent clamp... So, time for a new grill."
1,Sent wrong item,"Do not buy from this seller, I was sent the wrong item than what I ordered, and he would not correct it. I had to file a claim with Amazon.com to get it resolved."
2,For conductors rather than performers,"This book was assigned to me in a ""how to win and audition"" class. As a masters student in clarinet performance who takes professional auditions, I feel that this book does draw much needed attention to self awareness in music. However, this book also provides almost exclusively information regarding the conductor's perspective. While the book may have value to some, the grandiose and verbose treatment of the material was a little to much for my taste."
1,Very little.,"I don't usually write bad things about anything, but this book is very little of anything. It is mostly blank space and almost no real information at all. I finished it, and felt that I got almost nothing at all. Feeling good from a book is wonderful but it also has to have something from the author. This does not. Sorry for being negative, but I could not recommend this to anyone."
5,Thoughtful and inspiring,"This is a marvelous book! It speaks to the inner musician, the core of the artist. Jordan discusses not how we make music as much as why. Young musicians would do well to use thses ideas to help tap into their expressive potential. Older musicians have the opportunity to reflect on a lifetime relationship with beauty. Truly uplifting."
3,Do you like quotes???,"This is a good book in many ways, but something about it doesn't quite satisfy me. There are many, many excellent quotes in it - but the thing that struck me was that the author says much less than I'd like to hear. He prefaces each chapter with pages of quotes, and then states a basic idea and doesn't develop it very much. I oftentimes wanted him to elaborate on a concept because it didn't seem very clear - but that didn't happen. I think the most interesting parts in the book were the sections where you had to write in responses to questions asked. However, yet again I wasn't really quite sure what the point of the exercises were. The book is worth reading - especially since the quotes are so good - but I'd like to see another edition of it with more detail from the author."
1,Worthless,"I just wanted to say that I had to read this book and write three, two page essays on it. My only problem was, there was nothing to write about. He says the same thing different ways. I really don't see what people are getting out of this book. If you're a human being with emotion and you understand music's emotional neediness, then you don't need this book. I don't usually write negatively about things, but this book just upset me because there are people actually buying into everything and paying for a book that common sense would tell them already. If you have half a brain, you don't need this book."
1,Not what I expected,"I guess I failed to read the ""small print"" with regards to this ""book"" being a ""Miniature Edition."" I ordered this book because I know the ""For Dummies"" series of books are usually quite good. Maybe so for this book if it was a regular-sized book. For the price, it should be full size. Didn't find it very helpful for what I bought it for - understanding dreams. Not much to read - takes about 5 minutes. Buyer beware - be sure and read the ""small print"" before assuming you're ordering a standard-sized book!"
3,SWEET DREAMS,"You're falling. Awfully fast. Just as you are about to become road kill, you wake up. Sweating. Shaking. Shivering. And reaching for the Sominex. You're falling. Awfully fast.

Dream Doyenne Penney Peirce takes readers on a journey into the significant stratosphere of slumber, helping them analyze and interpret dreams, while also providing expert advice on recognizing different types of dreams, how to use dreams for creative inspiration and how to use dreams to improve communication and ... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
2,This book has some bad recipes,"I am a very good griller and pride myself on my marinades and the fact I love to try new things. I bought this book a couple years ago and have given up. Of the 12 different recipes I've tried only 2 have been very good. More often than not, just mediocre.I even had 3 recipes get the thumbs down, by far the worst buffalo wings recipe I've ever made- and I tried it twice.I would not recommend this to any of my grilling friends."
1,Absolute crap,"I can never get my drums anywhere NEAR sounding like a drum should, I have tried, and tried, and tried, and tried and failed every time. It is a HUGE source of frustration and anger for me. So I bought a drum dial, the reviews sounded great. It looked easy to operate and I was sure this is what I needed. I was wrong. It has been absolutely zero help. The reading varies greatly, even if I don't change the tension. I can put it down and it will read 74. Lift it directly up and put down and now it's on 76. These are brand new fresh heads. I will try and set every lug to let's say 76, then I go round again and it's all over the place. What a joke. Massive waste of money. I regret ever learning the drums."
5,Works,"Works great, i was a bit worried about the needle not being at the 12 o clock position, just moved the bezel, and moved the 0 where the needle is, works fine, i don't mind where the needle is as long as it works hahaha"
5,Should have bought this years ago... a must!,A friend of mine brought one of these over to my recording studio one night when I was recording a demo for his band. This thing blew me away! It is extremely accurate at measuring drum head tension at any point on the drum head. This allows you to accurately tune a head. I've been playing and recording for years and years and I have gotten really good at doing this by ear. However this takes my ability to get really close and lets me get dead on. My band musician friends all hear the difference. This is the best drum invention since the drum key. I got this through Amazon and of course it got here fast and in perfect condition. I love this thing!
4,cyclone,I use a knife everyday for work. The cyclone is easily opened w/the assist. It's slim and light. I just bought another one because this one is wearing down. The tortion bar assist broke on my old one after two years of heavy use. It has a sturdy wide blade. I find it's my favorite work knife.
4,Big pocket knife,"This knife is very big for a pocket knife. It is very well made, but I think the handle could have had a better grip surface. If it gets wet in your hand it could slip out. The handle is big, so if you have big hands like I do you can get a good hold on it. I like the option to turn off the assisted opening and use it as a flipper. If you like a big pocket knife this is the one to get. It has however been discontinued so you might want to grab one soon. I also have a Junkyard Dog II with the G-10 handle and it seem to be a little bit better. It's only a flipper but it's an up grade to the this one. I will say this. When the assisted opening is engaged, it opens fast and easy."
5,Best knife I own,This knife is very well made. Ken Onion knows how to build a great knife. The style and lines of this knife will amaze you. The blade is very sharp and the feel of this knife is amazing as well. It fits in your hand beautifully. It weighs enough to be substantial but not to heavy for carry. It really pops out when you want it to.
1,never recieved avoid seller,"sent knife as a flick knife to the uk, rather than assisted opening so got taken by customs no responce to my emails avoid this seller.im out of pocket 60 cheers"
5,Good History,Since my father was in this battle I found it very interesting. Some of the things mentioned in the book were mentioned to me by my father 30 years ago. Good research.
5,"Great Poetry, and selections","This is a great book of poetry, ad a great selection of poets and poems,11-poets, and all worth their salt, especially David Avidan, and all modern, with some Poetic Prose to boot, and a history of each one, and the price is reasonable. Dennis L. Siluk"
1,Wolf Shadows,"Seth Jabson lives in Minnisota. There house is right by the woods, Seths mom has a baby and seth has to stay at hhis freinds house.Seth and Matt decide to go hunting the next day. So the next day Matts paarents go hunting together and trusts seth and Matt to go by there selves. Seth and Matt see two Bucks clacking there antlers together on the pond. Instead of Matt shooting the deers he shoots the wolf that is near by.This book is REALLY BORING there is no action i dont like it at all!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Classic and forgotton great film!,"I had the soundtrack on Colgems records and loved the music and dialog, when I saw the movie was on DVD, I grabbed it! Classic Elliot Gould (with a 70's porno mustache and Candice Bergen was a knock-out in 1970! Great nostolgia!"
5,"An absolute ""must read"" for anyone paying taxes","Bert McLachlan's Saving Social Security (From Congress) is a vivid, cautionary advocate of the dire peril the current Social Security retirement plan is in. Written for the non-specialist lay reader in order to specifically to clear up lies and popular misconceptions, Saving Social Security (From Congress) unambiguously informs the reader of the facts about the federal budget and the options facing our nation today. This is an absolute ""must read"" for anyone paying taxes for Social Security now, or expecting to receive it in the future!"
3,Average only,"Nice color, nice pattern, but average at best as towels. It would take a very good sale price to make these worth buying."
4,Good Old Fashioned Western,"I'm a fan of the old fashioned Western movies of the 1950's- 1970's era and Apache Rifles is no exception. Audie Murphy stars as a Calvary Captain sent out to deal with a Apache Indian rebellion. The transfer is pretty good considering a 1964 movie but there are a few spots in the movie where the transfer suffers, but only briefly. If you're a fan of old fashioned Calvary versus Indians movie's like I am then you should add this one to your collection. Movie studios should release more of these old movies as there are plenty that haven't been released to DVD yet."
4,Drums Across The River And Apache Rifles,"Audie Murphy was a better actor then the Hollywood crowd every gave him credit for. Jealous of his Hero status, Medal Of Honor Winner. You every wonder why John Wayne never had him in any film. Too, much ego on Wayne's part. Burt Lancaster stared with him in the Unforgiven and Audie did a great job. Audie made 39 movies over his career and I have watched all but 2. I liked both Drums Across the River and Apache Rifles. I think the more people of today watch his movies the more they will apprecate his acting skill."
4,Hollywood's most underrated western star!,"Audie Murphy. World War II.s most decorated soldier (see to hell & back). To me growing up was movies on saturday with a western starring Audie Murphy. No he wasn't John Wayne. And some may say he only made B-westerns. Do not be misled. This guy was good. Real good. His remake of the James Stewart classic, Destry, was gutsy. But murphy pulled it off. Take a good look at just one Audie Murphy movie and suddenly you're hooked. And he pioneered the good bad guy. With his boyish looks it is difficult visionlizing Murphy as a cold blooded western killer until you remember this guy probably single handedly killed more men in WWII than any other man.His real life was tragic probably reflecting his mental scars from the war. But on the screen in a western or even in Red Badge of Courage his performances are compelling. Apache Rifles is not his best western. But it is well worth viewing."
4,Worth watching,"While not Audie's best Western (Try Six Black Horses, The Kid From Silver Creek, or No Name On The Bullet), this one is well worth watching. It has a well written script with a different storyline (Audies is an Indian hating cavalry officer), and a thought provoking ending.The action is well done, and as usual, Audie Murphy proves once again that he was a much better actor than he was ever given credit for...I would watch him read a telephone book. Another thing about his films is that in real life, Audie could do just about everything he did in the movies...The man really earned that chest full of medals and the title of ""The Most Decorated Soldier of WWII""...A true Hero in every way!!!!"
5,Apache Rifle,Apache Rifle is a great western movie with Audie Murphy. Audie Murphy is one of my all time favorite actors. All of his movies have a lot of action. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves Audie Murphy and western movies.
2,Confuse with the color,I was very disappointed when recieved this item because the toy's color is not as it shown in the picture. I have a set at home already which was bought a few years ago. They are in good quality and exactly like the picture shows. The kids enjoy them so I decided to order another set for my friend's kid. Now I don't know what to do this item since it doesn't even come with a box to store the pieces.
4,Good game,Lots of fun. Storyline is creative. You can actually play this without the use of a play book.
3,Good except for online multiplayer,The game looks great and is fun except that I primarily bought it to play online with friends and currently online play has been way to laggy to be doable.
4,The Diary of Adam and Eve by Mark Twain,"10-19-10 It is always interesting to hear another version of a familiar story. Some day I'd like to write one myself. I have already written an essay called The Exact Dimensions of Heaven, but after writing 1600 words I ended it with ""Of course, I will have to make it up!"" Mark Twain is funny and serious. His book was another unique adventure. vilima"
4,Cool Set,Having grew up on the Isley Brothers I can never stop saying how much there music has meant to me over the years&this Album of them splitting up from the Original unit is a must.the title track alone is one of the most Up-lifting tracks that I have heard in the past 20 years easily.these Guys are so Musically Versatile&can go into so many directions on a drop of a dime it's amazing.
4,"Some nice stuff, but is it really better than BCTSB?","Spawning the trio's most recognized recording, the unforgettable love ballad ""Caravan Of Love,"" IJI's sophomore album is more ballad-heavy than its predecessor, and features another great, if underrated one in ""I Can Hardly Wait,"" and overall, this is probably a more vocally robust album. However, in comparing this album to IJI's brilliant debut ""Broadway's Closer To Sunset Boulevard,"" this album is weak in some places where that album is strong. COL's more uptempo, rock-oriented selections, such as ""Dancin' Around The World"" and ""High Heel Syndrome,"" lack the explosive energy and truly robust feel of BCTSB's title track and ""Kiss And Tell."" Also, ""Insatiable Woman,"" another one of this album's ballads, though nice, sounds a lot like the more well-known (and better) Isley Brothers ballad ""Choosey Lover."" Overall, not that there isn't stuff to like about this album, but BCTSB is really the best place to start for the most satisfying IJI experience."
3,catchy tune from Miss Betty Boo,"I have to say I am a big fan of Betty Boo aka Alison Clark, and was hoping to see her release some new tunes, and load and behold I found Wig Wam....its a catchy tune and after listening to it a few times I found my self head bopping to this track, fun stuff it is and can't wait to hear the whole album, now if only Amazon.com would do a better listing , fore I find out there is a rock band called WigWam....no album covers, no info...whats the deal???? Anyways if you like Betty Boo, get this cd."
1,Does not deserve a single star,Save your money and time. Find something else to watch.I gave it a second chance and all I can say is that I am still shocked that I spent actual money on this DVD.Again save you time and money but something else.
2,hearing view of the deaf/hard-of-hearing world,"Since this book was not written by a hard of hearing person, it does not give an appropriate view of the hard of hearing world. This book could not apply to deaf people becasue deaf people cannot hear music -- only feel the vibrations. The book gives a clear view of how hearing people view the heard of hearing world. It is a beginning, but it is not the best book."
3,Some good stories...,"If you haven't read ""How to Be a Man"" I would suggest reading that over this book. With that being said, this book offers some original stories that are entertaining. However, since I read this right after ""How to Be a Man"" I noticed that many of the stories were the same and the writing was annoyingly similar.Overall an entertaining collection of stories and an easy read."
2,People of Wyoming,"This is a piece of mediocre writing, again not well researched . There are some inaccuracies and mislableing of some of the photos. It could be of interet to those who are acquainted with the area or people mentioned in the book."
4,Great First Step to Chinese Politics,"This is an excellent book if someone is looking for an introduction to chinese politics, history and its political economy. It is comprehensive and easy to grasp, and one of the few books of its kind that I actually found difficult to put down. It is not, however, the best book to look to for an in-depth discussion of specific topics. You should look elsewhere - you could start with Lieberthal's bibliography - if your intrests lie within a narrow subject."
3,It's not worth it.,The product is very expensive & I did not see a difference compared to commercial products in the market such as Gillette. It is not worth it to pay this much more for it.
1,Middle-school writing,"Count me among the handful who thought this book was perfectly dreadful. It's written in the prose of an eighth grader. I finished it, but only because I was on a plane and had no other books with me. My advice is to pass on this one."
2,. . . . . truly dreadful,"I bought this because Amazon.com lists it as an Agatha Award winner--Best First Mystery. Surely it isn't; someone _must_ have written a better first book.The plot isn't bad--just the writing. The characters are stereotypes. Fenimore is disgustingly p.c. The dialog made me wince, it was so unbelievably lame.Sorry, Robin, but getting taken for several dollars entitles me, I think, to critique your work. Don't give up your day job yet."
3,2 mules for sister sara,it was a good movie but they cut some parts out of it when they put it on the disc. they were good parts tooooooooo.
5,A classic Eastwood Western.,"I first saw this movie while I lived in Arizona in the late 1960's when I was a boy and the only thing I remembered then was the unforgetable soundtrack. Then a couple of years ago, I rented it and I enjoyed every bit of this movie. Clint Eastwood gives a humorous top notch performance as the drifting western mercenary who finally realizes he has a ""heart"", and Shirley MacLaine delivers excellently as a Nun who is not only running from the French Army but has a BIG secret. From the landscape of Northern Mexico/Arizona to the great acting and music, this is a movie to watch anytime and appreciate those westerns that only ""The Man with No Name"" can deliver! Two big thumbs up!"
3,"A Fighter, not a Lover","Clint and the West is like pizza--all edible, some better than others. Vintage Clint in action, especially his laconic saunter through progressively more dangerous scenes, but he and Shirley don't work. First, there's the problem of her pale, fleshy, freckled back in an early scene, which you're reminded of each of the several times Clint awkwardly announces how beautiful she is. Although I've never really gotten the Shirly McLaine appeal, it also seems Clint has gotten better with romantic scenes as he's aged. You can contrast him here or in any of the Sondra Locke movies with his scenes with Rene Russo in In the Line of Fire. Anyway, worth snagging on TiVo, but questionable as a DVD purchase."
3,Action but nothing else,"Probably not one of the best Clint Eastwood westerns, but packed with action and funny situations with the fake Sister Sara. It deals with the fight of Mexicans against the French army trying to colonize Mexico, but it lacks the finesse of most Clint Eastwood westerns and critical distanciatiion from social problems and western violence. But a lovable film for those who like action, even if it has no direction and no depth. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris universities II and IX."
2,Should have been better.,"For nearly 80 minutes, Two Mules for Sister Sara is an enjoyable and decent Comedy/Western that is ruined by a plot twist that pretty much negates the interesting development of all that came before it. It's almost as if though director Don Siegel and the screenwriter wanted to take the easy way out.Then, there's the climax, which features a violent and long battle sequence that is actually very impressively choreographed. So, why would I complain about it? Probably because it feels quite out of tone with the material before it. It's more like a sequence I would expect from one of Clint Eastwood's more bleak Westerns, like his Spaghetti trilogy. Still, this sequence isn't anywhere as much a betrayal to the film as the ""twist.""As for the performances, both Eastwood and Shirly MacLaine are good. Eastwood is as enjoyable to watch as ever and gets some good laughs."
5,Entertaining,"This movie was made in the day when actors depended on movie-makers depended on several things: good story, great script, excellent acting and good direction. This movie has all that and was made in the day when computer-generated special effects weren't needed. Mr Eastwood & Ms McClain were outstanding in this fun movie."
3,A Good Clint Eastwood Movie,Classic western fare from Clint Eastwood. Entertaining and stimulating. Good action and funny scenes.
4,great,"Clint Eastwood has a specific pattern and style he follows in his westerns. If you like one , you like them all.Eastwood's western films are like music; Miles Davis or similar and the way one's able to recognize the sound and style of music. Same applies to Eastwood. Very recommended"
4,Two Mules for Sister Sara,"I just love the old Clint Eastwood movies. In the desert Clint Eastwood runs into a nun that he decides to help. The nun turns out to be a saloon girl, bordello type, that adds a nice twist to this movie. I like to watch it time and time again."
3,Not bad,"This western from 1969, should be an absolute classic. It stars Clint Eastwood and Shirley MacLaine and its directed by Don Seigel.Sadly it never quite lives up to the stars and directors reputations. The start is very good, but after that it drifts along. I think the main problem may be the script. Seigels direction is occasionally interesting and Eastwood and MacLaine give decent performances, but by the end I didn't really care what happened.Its not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better."
2,Grill Cover is too short.,"I should have heeded the advice of several people who said this grill cover was too short and the wind blows it off. I'll figure that out, but the worst part, in my opinion, is the warning included with the cover that says you need to wash your hands after handling. I am very conscious of washing my hands, but this was a little scary to me. What kind of materials are used in this cover that are so bad you have to wash your hands immediately after handling?"
3,Fantastic product!,"This grill cover is amazing. The material is heavy and the fit is perfect. I live in Ohio and we can have quite alot of nasty weather and now my grill is protected completely from the elements. I priced these at several department stores in the area and this one cost half as much as the same quality in stores. Another reason I love, love, Amazon!"
3,Not for a 65 inch Char-Broil,"I bought this cover once, and what I got was a black, generic, thin cover. I ordered it a second time and received the correct cover. However, I have a 65-inch Charbroil grill and it did not fit. It came about 10 inches from the ground and the top did not fit well either. The cover itself is nice. Good quality. I was not happy that I had to pay for the return shipping. I don't really think its my fault it doesn't fit."
1,cheap cuz its cheap,lasted only the summer. faded very quickly. it tore along edge. its cheap (inexpensive) because it's cheap (poorly made). Save your money.
3,"Does the Job, but nothing great","I got a new BBQ and I wanted to make sure it didn't get ugly quick like my old one, so I got this cover to keep it nice. It fits my BBQ without issue and keeps rain & dirt from getting through, but it is more cumbersome to get it unfolded and over the BBQ then i would have liked and the color doesn't really match the pic.It was cheap and does the job though, so a positive review."
3,Say Goodbye on a Windy Day,"I like the way this grill cover fits and the way it looks. But there is apparently no way to fasten it to the grill to keep it in place. The previous covers I've had were equipped with Velcro fasteners, to pull them tight at the bottom. This one? Nothing.I know some windy day this coming winter I am going to look outside and see my grill exposed to the weather and my cover no where in sight."
3,cover ok,Seemed like a well constructed cover but had a problem with a seam seperating and colors seem to be fading fast from sun. However amazon stood behind it and warranteed it. Will see what happens next season.
1,Does not hold up,"I purchased this grill cover as a Christmas gift in Dec 2011. The first hot day in NY in May 2012 and the blue part faded to almost the same color as the gray center. I could have lived with that except shortly thereafter the seam holding the top of the cover together with the bottom section came undone. Now there is a 12"" hole from where the seams are supposed to be joined. We only started grilling in May so it is not from overuse. Would not recommend this to anyone. BTW: Charbroil did not want to do anything about it. Amazon however told me they would give me a $10 credit in my account (waiting to see if that will happen)."
3,It protects from the raw elements but not much more,I don't feel like this cover will really be a protect-it-all cover that maybe you could find elsewhere. The biggest problem it has is no Velcro or other means by which to really fasten it to the grill. The wind takes it off even if I have my grill leaning against something. It does seem to do a decent job against water from it's layers but I wouldn't expect it to last a very long time or be a pro at protecting against the elements.
1,Damage fabric,I received the item and there was damage in the fabric. I wish I can return it and get a refund but it so much of a hassle to return it.
2,Charbroil grill cover,"It is a very nice grill cover, it fits well, it looks good, however some how there are small tears in the cover. I do not know why or how they got there but I have only had it on the grill a couple of months. I wrote an email to the company that I purchased it from but have had no response from them."
4,Good Cover,"Pretty robust cover, held up through summers and NY winters. Used it through about 3 1/2 years before the seams started to rip. Nothing lasts forever I guess."
3,ok but it won't be what u think it is,all right but this isn't real muppets what it is just pictures of a book taped with a voice over it is ok for learning to read but it isn't really muppets
5,"Thank you , Frank Jordan!","I love this Midwest railway but hard to get there. This book has flavor of the field where red & white engine comes.Nice packing, nice condition, nice price everything good."
1,overpriced paperback,"I can't believe that anyone would publish a book of pictures of the beautiful Soo Line cars in BLACK AND WHITE. What a waste! I called Amazon, and they called the publisher to confirm that it wasn't a printing error. The cover is color, but all the pictures within are black & white. I was going to give it to my dad for Xmas, but I'll go take a picture of the Soo Line train myself...in color."
5,Loaded,"Lots of people know DOA from ""You Spin Me Round"" but this cd doesn't end with this classic it only begins. Youthquake is loaded from top to bottom, you certainly won't be reaching for the skip button. Absolutely one of my favorite cd's of all time."
3,Eat It,"I hate You Spin Me Round, but love, Lover Come Back, Cake And Eat It AND I Wanna Be A Toy AND In Too Deep. I love the dumb lyrics, I mean simple, well not really, maybe basic, whatever the case they are fun, there is too much repetition, but overall a fairly entertaining album."
4,Still spinning!!!,"You spin me right 'round baby, right 'round, like a record baby, right 'round, 'round and 'round. Burns baby burns, disco inferno!"
4,Wonderful Music,"Dead or Alive is a fantastic band. While the ""Youthquake"" album is perhaps best known for ""You Spin Me Round"", it also features eight other songs that are just as energetic, like ""D.J. Hit That Button"", ""Lover Come Back to Me"", and ""It's Been a Long Time"". They all have an 80's disco-club feel that gets you up and dancing. Whether you listened to this album when it first came out, or have never heard Dead or Alive before, fans of dance music will love ""Youthquake""."
2,Remember When PWL Sounded fresh?,"If I ever hear ""You Spin Me Round"" again it'll be too soon! That said, the other singles on this album are like audio crack! ""Lover Come Back To Me"" is one of my fave rave DOA tracks and I never tire of it. PWL hadn't completely formularised their production style yet so this album has a bit of life to it. The material is not quite up to snuff yet, though. DOA were not yet to the point of writing a strong album yet."
5,Dancequake!,"From beginning to end this album is relentless & just doesn't stop...it keeps giving it to ya from one song to the next. Oh the glorious 80's. Oddly enough my favorite song became ""In Too Deep"", even though I bought the album for the hit ""You Spin Me Round (Like A Record). Other gems are ""DJ Hit That Button"", ""Big Daddy of the Rhythm"", ""Cake And Eat It"", ""Lover Come Back To Me"", & ""My Heart Goes Bang"". This album is like a sinful pleasure and should be in any serious music collection."
4,Classic 80's Album,"Dead Or Alive made it big with ""You Spin Me Round"" back in the mid 80's and is considered a one hit wonder. However, they have made music that was just as good as their big hit. ""Youthquake"" is full of silly pop/electronic music that is fun and easy to dance to. ""Lover Come Back To Me"" and ""I Wanna Be A Toy"" are great tracks. ""It's Been A Long Time"" is a nice departure from their usual stuff, and gets somewhat deep musically, and lyrically."
1,Do NOT Purchase this Book,"The front cover should give you a clue about this book. The pages inside were apparently copied from the original book using one of those old magnifying copiers -each page is the size of the book, but in the very center of each page is a very, very tiny photocopy of a book page - about 1/2 inch by 3/4 inch (about the size of that black square that you see on the cover). The print, of course, is smaller than that. You need a magnifying glass to read these pages. I am not joking, but this book IS a JOKE - in other words, if you want to give someone a joke gift, then send this book. Otherwise, avoid this book. It is a sham. I wish I could attach a photocopy of one of the pages. Be warned!"
3,God but not enough,i get the package a little late also inever get a tracking number so i naver get notice about where tha package was.. besides that thebook its a really good book
5,Wonderful Book!,I bought 2 of these books for my granddaughters.....they both enjoyed them and would highly recommend....Great book for pre-teens!
2,The ECMA Spec is More Useful,"From its table of contents, this book would seem to be an invaluable resource for vm architects or compiler writers. Unfortunately, the book is wrong in places and the online errata page isn't updated. Also, the explanations aren't as in depth as I would like. This book should be a companion or replacement to the ECMA CIL specification. Sadly, it's neither."
3,This book is mostly about the IL language,"I was looking for a book which offered a more detailed view on .NET assemblies and interaction with the CLR: guidelines for packaging and deploying assemblies, how the CLR locates assemblies, etc.This book does provide that information, nonetheless, my mistake was not realizing that this is a book mainly about the *IL language* itself. I was not interested in looking into that much detail. The book also covers in great detail what exactly is stored in a .NET assembly. I also liked the discussion on interoperation of managed and unmanaged code.If you're looking for a book on IL, this is your book, otherwise it seems that the book 'Compiling for the .NET CLR' is a better book for what I was looking for."
4,great gentle shampoo for processed hair,"I've been using this shampoo off-and-on for years. It's great for those who chemically straighten their hair. It doesn't get your hair squeaky clean, but it hydrates well and defrizzes a little. The smell is good, too. The price online is much better than prices I've seen in stores."
1,"OMG! BORING, BORING, BORING!!!!","I am an avid reader of historical romance novels, as well as a former high school English teacher, and when I read junk I know it. This book is simply a waste of time. What could the author have been thinking? Or the publisher for that matter? After ""slogging"" through this thing for almost 3 days, (when I usually finish a book in a day) I finally got to the predictable, and unexciting ending...need I say more? Save your money."
1,Simply...a ripoff,"This product may very well be the most overpriced item available on Amazon. The cloth you receive will be the same cloth that you can get for free from Walmart at the eye glass department. It is extremely small, very thin and in my opinion -- not very impressive! Buy it if you have extra money to throw away on something you will likely not use."
1,not pleased at all,I used this cloth to shine my sterling earrings. It was a waste of money! A towel or any soft cloth would do the same thing. The shipping and handlig was almost as much as the cloth! Don't waste your money like I did.
4,An old classic,"Ludwig Prandtl's lectures at Gottingen form the basis for this, the basic building block of classical aerodynamics. Expect to learn about the basic assumptions inherent to the use of linear theory to aerodynamic problems. Be prepared for the use of conformal mapping and functions of complex variables. Best read in combination with the companion volume on Applied Aero- and Hydro-mechanics."
3,A Good Book If:,If you have no experience period. If you have worked with a mixer and a few microphones even just a little bit you would probably want to look for a more advanced book.
5,Dan's Angel,This is a wonderful introduction to the world of painting for young children. The angel leaps out of The Annunciation painting by Fra Angelico and guides a young detective through a museum. The painting selection is excellent and the discussion between Gabriel - the angel - and Dan - the young detective - is very witty. I would love to find more books like this for my children!
3,Easy reading,"It is a very high level description on the 1929 crash.One thing which I did notice which is very misleading, it clearly states that, ""For all of his uncanny instincts, however, Jesse Livermore was no match for the Stock Market Crash of 1929. He lost everything."" (see page 37). Also includes a photo of Livermore.For those who are a true Livermore follower, you will know that this is not correct. Contrary to this from the book, he actually made $100 million during the crash of 1929, by selling short.For more information on Livermore visit jesselivermore dot com.I am hoping that there will be a second edition of this book which will have this information corrected."
2,doesnt follow the title,this movie was bad I mean I thought when I saw the title it meant that these army or navy or armed forces would take on a whole hord of Nazi zombies like the title says and it didn't the story line sucked it was to predictable and the ending was horrible I was generous when I rated this movie 2 stars out of 5
2,Did I Miss the Zombies or Nazis???,"I must have fallen asleep or went into a coma, but the movie was really lacking any Zombies, Nazi's or Acting or Plot or.......... well you get the picture. This movie was really really lame, if your looking for a good zombie or Nazi or anything movie then this is ""not"" the movie to watch, now if your looking for a movie to put you to sleep real quick then watch it, Heck it is better than Valium."
2,No Nazis and very little zombies,"This movie was a stinker. The cast's acting was wooden and their voices sounded like they were talking into cups. The tiny, framed screen was also highly annoying. There was no climax to this movie and I ended up not caring if anyone survived or not. Most of the killing comes within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and much of it is caused by the ""elite"" unit of commandos sent to do...something? I was however entertained by the guy with the golden curly perm. It's a shame they made him a red shirt. Don't bother with this movie, it's a waste of time and money."
4,SPF60 Sunblock,"Just in case you didn't read the item name (or description carefully) this $18 set includes TWO of the big bottles of sunblock.As for the sunblock itself, I was looking for sunblock w/ Parsol 1789 (an additive that is supposed to be much better at blocking harmful UV rays and free-radicals) as well as being > 50SPF so this one fit the bill. It definitely works since my friend who burns after 15 minutes in the sun was able to stay out for a good 3 hours w/out being burned. However, the texture is very much like a tacky glue-- sticky and thick. That is one definite trade-off in using this sunblock."
3,Cheap but works,"I bought this a while back and finally got a chance to work with it. Its not a bad unit, inexpensive and therefor it is what it is. Thing that sucks about this unit is that its weak, the best I can describe it is its a lill bit stronger than a dremel. I probably should've spent the extra coin and gone with a bigger model. For light duty work though, it does the job. I have a heavier duty Makita which will easily tackle bigger jobs."
1,have to return mine,"I requested this stand mixer as a Christmas Gift in Dec. 2006. They were back-ordered, so I didn't receive it until around February 2007. I have used it a total of 4 times. The first time, no prob. The second time, the motor was either off or on high. That's it: two speeds. I couldn't adjust the speed with the knob, no matter how hard I tried. I tried to call Customer Service, but they're conveniently closed on Saturdays, when most working women use their mixers. So, I put it away and forgot to call Customer Service again. I got it out again about a month later, and thought I'd give it one more shot. Tada! It amazingly worked! ""It fixed itself!"" I thought. Well, I got it out again today, and the motor or transmission or whatever is acting up again. So I've made myself a note to call Customer Service next week. Hopefully it can be fixed easily, because it looks really nice and I really want to be able to use it!!!"
3,Nice pattern not a good fit,I like it but if your not as well endowed as the model it won't look as good. I have a smaller bust so I had to lace the corset really tight at the top to make it look ok.
2,Cheap quality,"Wow I cannot believe this corset has almost 5 stars. I was immensily disappointed with it. I will recognize that I was expecting a little bit too much for a $40 corset. When I opened the package I thought it was a joke. The corset was made of the cheapest quality ever, I was really disappointed because it looks beautiful on the picture. The worst part was the thong, oh my god, it was the crappiest quality ever probably like 100% nylon or something.The size was also really inaccurate. I wear a 34 bra but this corset seemed to be made for a 38 or more. I thought corsets were made to look tight on you but this one was ridiculously big on me. I'm glad that I was at least able to return it and got a refund. DON'T buy this unless you want a cheap thing to wear once like on halloween and then throw it away."
2,Not very good.,"I was not very happy with this piece. For one it did not fit in the bust at all. Very very loose. Also it was not reversible at all. Just black on the other side. I would not recommend this item, it is not worth what you pay for it."
3,a little big,"I owned this corset before from Dreamgirls, but someone in my family threw it out. I order it on here for a great price. The only problem was I'm a 36D, and ordered a 34. It was still too big in the bust area for me."
3,Way too big...,"This corset is gorgeous, and I wish it fit.... I ordered the corset because I needed one for Rocky Horror (a legit excuse to buy one, I think), so I ordered smallest size available, a 32. I'm a 32a, size 2, and even with this thing laced up as tight as it would go, I still had to wear hello kitty bandaid ""pasties"" so as to not flash the audience with the huge gap between my chest and the corset when I had to crawl around on stage..."
3,Ehhh. Glad I got it for less.,"Overall, I was fairly happy with the corset. I did have to send one back, though, before I was completely happy.The black side looks better than the pink side...it's easy to see strings on the pink. Also, the panties that came with it were cheaply made and will be replaced by another kind.I probably would have been less happy if I had paid more than I did. If you're concerned about quality, you probably want to go to Frederick's."
1,Cute but WAY too small,"This item is very cute, especially for the cost, but is much too small. I wear a bra size 36B and assumed that a 36 would fit. It was not large enough to even get on! Order a larger size than your bra size if you want it to fit!"
4,great!,"i bought this and was pretty impressed. i got a 32 because i'm skinny, and it fits great. its well-made and sturdy enough that a preson who is small busted and unsure about it could go ahead and go a size down for a really sexy look. i wore it all night at a burlesque and it didn't budge or strain, and people complemented my tiny waist. the pink side has a nice gold sheen to it and isn't too cutesy. and it really is reversable, albeit its harder to do the black side since it takes a bit more effort to hook it opposite ways, but thats fixable with the laced up backing anyways. over all really satisfied for the price."
1,I will never purchase from this co. again,"The corset itself looks amazing, Unfortunately it was too small. When I asked to return the product not even 2 days after I received it, I was told no. This company is extremely unreasonable considering that we are purchasing over the internet, it's not like we were at a store where we would be able to try it on before we purchased the item. I have never come across such a situation, as a matter of fact, at the same time I purchased this corset I purchased another one, but that one was too big. I got in contact with the company and was able to return the item.I'm extremely disappointed and aggravated with the company."
1,Eyelets broke on first wear,"This corset was beautiful, BUT the first time we laced it up the top 3 grommets tore straight from the fabric. I was very disappointed in the fact that even though the top was no where near tight the back reacted as though i was trying to shove 200 extra pounds into this garment. Again, Beautiful design, crap materials."
3,it fits well,"It fits well, except that the ties in the back are really short. so if you are a bit bigger in the mid section you either buy a size larger or get black ribbon. other than that its great. looks awesome on. i dont mind that you can see the hook and eyes on the black side. i have a more expensive one and you can see them on tht one as well and it is one sided..."
3,"Looks great, but has cheap boning","I got so many compliments the first time I wore this corset. Unfortunately, I will probably never wear it again. I got the correct size but the boning is so cheap that it was deformed after the first wear.If you're looking for a cheap option for a one-time costume piece, this corset is perfect for your needs. However, if you're looking for something long-term, I suggest taking the time to find a nice one with metal boning."
3,decent,"It was decent but I did have to purchase more ribbon because there was simply not enough, one eyelet is lose already but other than that its a great product for the price"
5,so sexy and fits true to size,this Corset is great and fully reversable in fact i used the reverse side first you just need to cut the tags off.it fits true to size a little loose in the chest area but i wear a 36C and the rest fit perfect and looks amazing on.very flattering and i highly recommend.
4,Corset,"Really liked this corset. Fits good, looks good. The only thing I didnt like was that the stockings are rather short. So if you are tall they wont fit. I am only 5'7"" and they were too short. But I would recommend."
1,Information not clear,"The item is beautiful. I can't wear it because they don't specify that the size is for a DD cup. Also is not fully reversible. It have a well done lining, but the hook and eyes will see mistaken if you used reversible."
2,Not True to Size,"I agree with the lady above the item is beautiful. I did just as the company reccomended by buying one size smaller than I wear in bra size. This was not a good Idea. I can not wear the item. It is too small. also if I did go up to the size I wear I would not be able to wear it because of the cup size...Over all it is a beautiful Corset, just not what I expected. Will be a nice gift for my friend.."
3,dream girl corset.,After reading the reviews. I decided to buy this one after searching for the right one. The only reason I give this a three star is because I'm a 36d and it made me look very flat chested. There is thousands hooks up front which didnt want to stay closed. I had to go buy some more thinker and longer ribbon for the back. It also feels very cheap.
4,Looks nice,Everything looked nice but the hat had lots of wrinkles from being compressed in shipping. I wasn't sure how to get them out. It's hard to iron a top hat.
5,Aweome! Fabulous! Great Value!,Great Value! Exactly what we were looking for! Easy to trim if needed! Blocks light well! Installs in minutes!
4,does the job,It's made of a durable paper and serves it's intended purpose well. Relatively easy to modify and install. I use it to block out more light since my curtain is really thin. Good for what I paid.
4,As advertized,"These are inexpensive, easy to install, and they reduce the heat in my living room when used with my darker damask curtains which cooked the room when used alone. These don't block the sunlight, they just reduce the light entering; they also are not high quality permanent-type blinds, I just use them in the summer to reduce interior heat.I ordered 2 and Amazon sent each of them in its own 3 1/2'x2'x2' box, the dimension of the blind is about 3'x2""x2"". Lots of wasted space and packing material."
4,Great shade - Not great adhesive,"I really liked these shades but I had two of them up for about a month when they both fell down. After trying several adhesives that I had, I replaced them with the extra paper shades that I had stored. This would be a great product if it had better adhesive."
3,Ok for the price,"You can't beat the price. It is super easy to cut to size and there are little plastic covers to finish off the ends. The only problem I have with it is that it really isn't room darkening. My daughters room gets direct sunlight for most of the day and this blind just doesn't really help. It is improved over a blind with no ""darkening"", but it is not for rooms that are super sunny."
3,"Fair, but to many options at same price","I would not purchase this set again. The spatula is nice but the tongs can be difficult to use. The tongs normal open position is not very large, which can make it difficult to get around foods such as chicken. The tongs have no teeth. Without teeth you can easily slide them under your food, but with no teeth it is difficult to maintain a firm grip on that food. The quality of the set is good. The stainless steel seems to be of a good grade. The spatula and tong handles are stamped. This stamping process leaves two lips that are bent downward. The lips seem to collect food in such a way that makes them not entirely easy to clean. Overall, not a bad set."
4,Good to Train Yourself too,"Good job at training you to do mental preparation too. Can work with other species, not just about the horses."
5,A joy to read,Well written and a joy to read. A must read for any horseman trying to improve their riding.
4,Excellent !,I love this book because this give a crash course in pan-africanism and it is very educational.
1,Paperback is student companion,"Note that the paperback version is the student study companion to the hardback book, not a paperback version of the original text."
2,if anyone else had released this...,"Compared to other Dylan albums, this is one of my least favorite. But even at his worst, Bob is still the best. People like to jump on the bandwagon and say that between ""Blood on the Tracks"" and ""Oh Mercy"", Dylan had lost his muse. But if anyone else had released ""Empire Burlesque"", this admittedly mediocre album, they would be hailed as the ""new Dylan"" and a genius.If you have the money, I suggest you invest in the Bootleg Series 1-3, and listen to what Bob was recording at the time but not releasing. (The alternate version of ""When the Night Comes Falling"" is inspired and definately one of his best ever)."
5,Not the best of his 80's output but still very good,Empire Burlesque is the point where Bob buys into the 80's culture completely. Check out the almost new wave look he has on the cover.The first song - Tight Connection - is the best song on the cd and one of the best Bob would put out in the decade. The rest of the of the cd has a hard time living up to Tight Connection but it's still a lot of fun.
3,relatively uninspired songwriting,"Dylan shut down his songwriting after this record. He was running dry. Regardless of what the detractors say, this record sounds decent by 80's standards. Some of lyrics are very dull by Dylan's standards. There are the usual out-of-tune guitars on a track or two. There's a hapless backup vocalist who was likely never allowed to rehearse her parts. And the big, long song is absolutely drowning in goofy synth and electronic drum noise. What's to like?'Clean Cut Kid' is a Dylan classic, really his only explicit take on Vietnam after the war. And the two love songs, 'Remember you' and 'Emotionally Yours' are both fetching and graced with superb faux Robbie Robertson solos courtesy of Heartbreaker Mike Campbell (the one thing that is consistently good on this record is the solo guitar players). 'Dark Eyes', praised by so many reviewers below, is a fine lyric saddled with a ludicrous melody."
3,"Often forced, but sometimes forceful (whatever that means)","Apparently baffled to see lesser talents like Bruce Springsteen rack up huge sales in the 80s while his own albums were just denting the top 40, Bob Dylan got himself some hot shot producer to pour some gloss on ""Empire Burlesque."" It didn't really work, but though the album is disappointing, it is far from a failure. As ""The Bootleg Series 1-3"" proved, most of the songs here sounded fresher and more inspired without the studio varnish, but ""Tight Connection to My Heart"" is still pretty terrific, and a few of the love songs (""I'll Remember You"" and ""Emotionally Your's"") are as good as any he's written. The acoustic ""Dark Eyes"" is a definite highlight, but the rest of the lineup is fairly standard stuff. Not bad, but lacking that something extra that makes a song stick to your brain. The album is very much worth owning though, even if it does hint at the creative drought that was to come in the four years preceding the release of ""Oh Mercy."""
3,An OK album,"Bob Dylan / Empire Burlesque: While there are a couple of radio hits here, and some nice lyrics, the rest of the album is merely OK. There's nothing particularly bad here, it's just that there's nothing particularly outstanding either. This one is OK, so I give it Three Stars."
4,Dylan's Eighties Electronica,"Upon the first several listens, what's readily apparent is an album that won't win him any ribbons. Whereas the production on, say, ""Slow Train Coming"" was effectively glossy, here it often reaches glossy overkill. The biggest offense is the lifeless ""When the Night Comes Falling From the Sky"", the longest cut that seems twice as long. Furthermore, becoming entranced with electronics at this juncture, comes the emergence of a conflict between artistry and commercialism. Still, I like the single ""Tight Connection To My Heart"". ""Clean Cut Kid"" is a powerful statement that cuts the war clouds of Vietnam and U.S. Foreign Policy. And, on his only solo performance, ""Dark Eyes"", he manages to sound slick and stark simultaneously, a neat trick. Though this slightly deals an artistically damaging blow, it's far from a death blow. It beats most synth-pop of the period and Dylan's voice and words retain their pungency. ***1/2"
4,His most underrated album,"I loved this record when it first came out, and I still do: it really holds up. At least 4 or 5 of the songs on it are Dylan classics, and I never understood why it received such poor reviews and sales when he's done a lot of other critically-acclaimed stuff in the past 15 years I'm not so fond of.I'd put this in the top 5 or so Dylan albums to own."
3,Not Dylan's best,"Empire Burlesque's mediocrity makes you wonder if Dylan didn't cut this album to make a quick buck. The lyrics are weak and shallow, and Dylan's vocals resound with an annoying nasal twang that lacks soul or feeling. Of all of the Dylan albums I have, this one is my least favorite."
4,Better than you think!,"If anyone other than Bob Dylan had recorded this album, it would have garnered rave reviews from fans and critics alike. But, because Ol' Bob has such a legacy to live up to, if it's not ""Blood on the Tracks"" or ""Highway 61,"" then both critics and fans pay it no heed. This is a very good CD. Sure, not every song clicks, but I can name few CDs from any artist that gets every song right all the time. This is a very enjoyable album to listen to straight through. The CD version allows you to edit out the tunes you are not happy about. You won't do that much with this one. It's a darn fine '80s record from Dylan. Maybe not as good as ""Infidels,"" but it is very different and you can't compare the two. Listen to this, then listen again. You will be very pleasantly surprised."
2,These are mostly repackaged old videos,"I am a big fan, but there was nothing to warn me that these are repackaged from old videos (except for Afro/Latin, hadn't seen that before).So if you have MaDonna's earlier stuff, you've probably got this too.Bummer, I was looking for new choreography."
3,Choreography,"It is like taking a dance class, where you get good choreography.But the dances aren't exactly the kind you can use on the dance floor with a partner."
4,interesting,"I had to buy this book for a class. It was nice enough to read, but I probably would not have picked this one out for leisure reading material."
4,"English Invasion, again.","Come May when this film is released in the US, this soundtrack will find it's fans, but why wait? Like Lock, Stock, Trainspotting, and films of the like, this music serves double duty as good collection of tracks and a good music piller in the film, enjoy."
4,good sampler,"If you saw the movie, you would like the album. I would suggest a different order for the tracks, but it is fairly reasonable as it is... Also, if you see the movie in detail, you would spect to get more tracks in this album."
4,A Soundtrack You Wouldn't Think Was Good,"From the movie title, Layer Cake, you'd think the soundtrack would be bad. In fact, this is one of the few soundstracks I'D BUY because it has some great music on it and the way they tied to the music to the scenes in the movie I thought was great.The Cult's She Sells Sanctuary and the scene of the Audi driving to the country club I thought was rich!- SJW"
2,I wish this was listed on Itunes,There were only three songs that were notable. Very disappointing. Did not need to buy an entire CD for three songs.
2,sounds better in the movie,"nothing wrong with the CD, the music is just better suited to the movie than listening on a stero"
1,Buggy firmware. Crashes on ethernet access.,"If two PCs access the disk at the same time (different files), its embedded OS crashes. Even the power switch does not work when this happens: you have to unplug the power cord.So the most important feature of the product is fatally flawed, destroying the primary reason for buying an ethernet disk.Note: LaCie confirmed this bug (and a few others), promised a bug fix weeks ago, and still have not delivered."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!!,"I ordered the RCU310BB 3 Device Remote Control which I knew was exactly what I needed and I knew that it works great! Unfortunately, what I received was a completely different universal remote that did not work on my 20 yr old VCR, which is why I wanted the RCU310BB and knew that the RCU310BB would work! I had previously tried other universal remotes and they didn't work on the old VCR. Additionally, I had ordered a RCU310BB in NEW condition and what I received was a universal remote in a package that had previously been opened. When I contact Amazon.com about the problem with this order I was told that the RCU310BB was not available and the vendor had sent a product that they thought would be compatible for me. It wasn't and I received a credit on my Amazon.com account. Needless to say I was very disappointed in this purchase."
3,Works,Hard to write review for something like this if I only use it for parking. It stops my car from rolling down the road while parked.
2,Disappointing,"If anything, my headaches and eye strain have been worse while wearing these. I was looking for some (relatively) affordable computer glasses with not-too-hideous frames (some of the ones out there are just awful) because I spend all day at work staring at the computer and it's taking its toll on my eyes, but now I wish I had sprung for the better quality glasses. The Gunnar ones seem to get good reviews, I'd suggest trying those instead."
5,THE Missing Link,"If you have done a lot of self help, and didnt take any action get this book. This man learned from the best in the marketing industry, people who influenced millions to spend billions. He truly understands what is needed to create the drive inside of you to CAUSE action.I say CAUSE because if you follow the program dilligently, and listen actively, you wont have to MAKE yourself take action. It will just happen as a natural process of your new thinking. Heres an example;I always wanted to hit the gym. Im a skinny guy, and I know that working out will give me more energy and muscle. After reading the first two chapters, I stopped and did every exercise, answered every question he mentioned. This took me an hour, and at the end of the hour I literally got up and went to the gym.Im not big on hype, but if you really want to change your life pick this book up. Its filled with ideas that will shift your reality far beyond what you thought was ever possible for you."
1,Great for insomnia....,"I truly believe the author made a game out of taking about 45 minutes' worth of content and stretching it out to several CD's in length. There is some good material here, but it gets covered up by endless anecdotal and honestly, dumb stories. I kept thinking, ""Get to the point, man!"".I'm about three-quarters of the way through and I'm ready to say uncle. I seriously doubt that I'll bother to finish it."
2,It's mostly just silly,"The author seems to enjoy telling you (many times) how much work he has put into researching and translating these insights from those goofy academics so that you can understand it. Then, after giving you the most basic first insight (you need to understand WHY you should be motivated) he proceeds to come up with the most ludicrous illustrations for his points. For example - if you have a bad attitude, that's like having a negative 10. To get to positive motivation, you have to MULTIPLY that negative 10 by another negative 10 (i.e., tear down the shaky foundation and start with a stronger foundation). Then - you have POSITIVE 100! Do you see the obvious connection between emotion and mathematics? Well, neither did I. Combine that with his faux motivational speech patterns and I stopped listening before the end of the first CD. It's mostly just silly."
1,Deceptive and disapointing,"As with many such books this one starts with the regurgitation of other motivational authors' ideas with a few original and thought provoking passages of its own. Then part way through, the author chooses to inflict upon us his right wing, Christian fundamentalist views.Now, most motivational authors mention spirituality in some context, but Beeler evangelicises for chapter after chapter.If I want a book about Christianity I will seek one out. I do not appreciate having the hard sell for Jesus sprung upon me in this way."
3,"Lather, Rinse, Repeat.","The content is largely a compilation of the thoughts and ideas of many brilliant minds (Covey, Jung, Maslow) and there are some gems included that will almost certainly be of value for those who aren't already familiar with them. Personally, I was disappointed by the lack of original thought by the author and felt that he mainly had just re-packaged what has already been. The ""hidden"" sales pitch for his coaching, and for coaching in general, and the infomercial tone were also turn-offs. If you're interested in the content, I would say to try to get it from your library first. If you find it's worth it for you, then buy it."
1,Boring,I listened to the audio version. The author seems to have done his homework when putting the book together. References one study after another. However it is painfully boring. It comes across like a dry college lecture. I didnt hear anything I havent heard from other motivational speakers. I put off listening to the last 2 CDs. Disappointed and would love to have my money back. It wasnt for me.
4,"Great, second edition can be better","What a great idea for a book. Very entertaining look at a handful of classic, mostly-American, pop songs. The origin of each song is described (that's the most interesting part) and then there's a pretty detailed run through of many of the recorded versions (that can get a bit tedious, especially if you're unfamiliar with the versions discussed).What it lacks is an index, and a formal discography. It would have also been nice if the lyrics of each song had been printed, and maybe the actual written music as well. Friedwald often describes the structure of the song by using the lyrics as guide posts, and that left me high and dry sometimes since I was, I'm ashamed to say, unfamiliar with some of these songs--I couldn't even hum St. Louis Blues, let alone recall any lyrics. A companion CD--or CDs--would have been nice as well, but that idea may be a little impractical.Those flaws aside, I'd recommend this to anyone with any interest in the subject."
5,music lover's delight,"Well written, without being pedantic, Stardust Melodies packs an awful lot of information. It has plenty of interesting vignettes. Guaranteed to make you go out searching for more versions of these classic songs. I liked it, and I am going to read more of Friedwald's writing."
1,early zipper failure makes for a useless tent,"We used the tent about eight times--five nights on a Boyscout trip and three in the back yard. The stuff sack it comes in is not very durable, and rips easily. The front zipper jammed and then completely separated, making for a useless tent while on a campout. Luckily we brought a spare tent. What's the use if you can't protect your tent in the stuffsack or zip the flap closed? You get what you pay for, unfortunately. Maybe the earlier models were better. By comparison, we have other tents (REI campdome) thirteen+ years old--zippers are in perfect condition. I only bought this tent after what seemed like hours of reviews and comparisons. I would get a used, better tent, or spend a little more and get something different."
5,Great Tent,Our Boy Scout Troop uses this tent. It is a very strong tent that sets up easy. It is way to heavy for a back packing tent but for a camping tent you will not find a better tent. Lots of room and good ventilation so the tent stays dry even in the heat
5,Very Nice Tent,"I just purchased three of these for our Boy Scout Troop.We camp about five to six times a year. They will be used to replace the same kind of tents that are twenty three years old and still usable. The old ones will become our extra's. This tent is very well made and extremely easy to set up, very durable and very waterproof. We have spent weekends in continuous rain and the inside of the tents stayed very dry. I would recommend this tent for anyone. Probably the best feature is that you just stuff it into the bag. No trying to do the impossible and fold it back up to fit into a bag that is way to small. Plus by stuffing it into the bag you don't get the fold marks which weaken the material."
5,Eureka Timberline 2,"I purchased a Eureka Timberline 2 tent when I was 13 years old. I am now 41 and my son is using it on a regular basis. The tent has been used for over a quater of a centry and still does not leak, with proper care. I just bought a new Eureka 1610 for the family and expect the same service as the Timberline 2."
2,Does not do well in the wind,"My family bought a set (4-5) of these tents in the late 80's. Good looking. Easy to use.... Then the storm hit. The wind mangled these things into pretzels. The poles were never the same after that. Domed tents, even bottom of the line Colemans, do so much better in the wind. Domed tents are cheaper, roomier, sturdier."
4,FAST SHIPPING !!,"I order this item and it came in the very next day. The cologne smells very good also. I have not yet got a chance to use it in an outing yet. From what I smell, its very nice."
4,Interesting and Important book,"Interesting book. His main thesis is that within society at large Christians should not claim to be anything else other then Christians. Furthermore, their concern should be in building the church up and not worrying as much about the greater society. Furthermore, he is not so much interested in issues and in the person. In other words, any confusion about what a person is to do is because the individual does not know who they are. Once they understand who they are then the decisions will come naturally. These points, as well as some other, are controversial. This book gives Hauerwas' controversial positions a systematic explanation. Not everybody is going to agree with him, but yet his ideas have become influential and are important to understand."
5,Maravillosa Aventura,"Una fascinante historia, te mantiene a la par junto a las aventuras que aqui se relatan, lo unico peligroso es que resulta adictivo!!! una vez abierto no lo puedes cerrar hasta terminarlo!!! y una vez terminado.... lo extrañas!!! un maravilloso viaje en la rueda de la fortuna"
2,Premio Alfaguara 2003?,Como es posible que un libro tan mundano y superficial sea galardonado con un premio asi. Carece de toda profundidad literaria.No cabe duda que hoy en dia uno tiene que ser mas selectivo en lo que lee.En dos palabras: Mundano y Superficial.
5,Most unusual viewpoint,"Gurdjieff in EgyptThis is an incredible video, unique in content and approach. Anyone who has an interest in self-transformation, The Gurdjieff Work [in whatever form], or just the philosophical history of mankind will enjoy and treasure it.Taking what evidence there is and applying logic and intuition to the job, Patterson, the writer, director and editor, makes reasoned, and reasonable assumptions about the source and origins of the Fourth Way. The video uses simple graphics, beautiful images and fascinating on-location video footage to explain a complex and most important subject in a clear and interesting manner.A unique perspective on man, mankind and Christianity. Well worth the time. Highly recommended."
2,disappointing,"I bought this on sale and I'm so glad that I didn't pay full price for it. I gave it two stars because it seems like it would be okay for cleaning up spills, but other than that it's pretty much useless. It may very well last for 30 minutes on a single charge but it starts to lose suction within 3-4 minutes. (It wouldn't be so bad if it were capable of running while plugged in. It isn't.) The attachments just make it worse, and the carpet attachment (the wide one) causes it to lose suction pretty much altogether. The filter is also next to impossible to clean...I have a stick vac with a similar filter that the dust just shakes off of. This one somehow manages to hold onto the dust, even when you try to scrape it off. Overall, a big disappointment."
1,What a waste!,I bought this little vac since I didn't have the attachments for my regular vac. The filter clogs after the second sweep. My broom and dustpan worked faster and easier.
3,Mug Handle Comes Loose,"I was attracted to this product because of the beautifully designed handle. However, a number of flaws soon emerged:(1) The handle (and mug) gets uncomfortably hot to the touch when filled with hot liquid.(2) The handle grip is not comfortable.(3) Most disappointing of all, the handle loosens after repeated use (I've had the mug for about a month, hand wash only) and now drops off repeatedly, posing a hazard especially when mug is filled."
2,Quality not as good as it looks,"I bought the New Wave coffee mugs/ cups and saucers including this Latte Macchiato cups to look great in a set however the handle would slip off easily. The thought of the design of being able to take the handle off is good because you can wash the cup in the dish washer but at the same time, the cup would not be able to hold the handle securely. Although you probably would not be holding the cup itself since there's a metal handle but knowing that it would actually slip off by itself. Not too appreciated. So I had to returned it at the end... :("
1,Bagpipe case,"The case is supposed to be felt lined. Just the sides of the case are felt lined. One of the clasps has a screw in it which is not flush with the clasp. The other clasp attachments are pins that are flush with the case. Some of the hardware is partially exposed on the inside of the case. The case is useable, but I'll have to put a towel in it due to the lack of a felt lining. On the plus side not a bad price."
3,Item returned trouble free,"The product was listed to fit my specific application, but was wrong size! I thank Amazon for making a trouble free return! Although the item didn't fit, the quality appeared to be very good..."
1,Misleading title,"It isn't the Insider's Guide to Credit. It's the Insider's Guide to Credit Repair. If the word repair was dropped from the title, it might be a decent book. Even a great book. However, that word IS there.You first get to the repair part on page 179!I skimmed through the first chapters, because I'd spent the money. They do seem well-written and for those just beginning their lives in credit America, it's good advice, to be sure.I went through a divorce where my ex did everything she could (and is still doing, 4 years later) to destroy my credit. I've done what I could up till now but wanted some solid advice on fixing the things I couldn't get done myself. Given the title and rating, plus the fact this title was recent, I felt it could help. Two chapters (2) on repair. Thanks for taking my money.Can not recommend given the title. Change that and I might think it's something you credit noobs could use. Until then it's just another attempt to take your money, too."
3,For Cat Lovers,Charmingly written pieces depicting the English countryside and a cozy cottage with the antics of the neighborhood cats. Amusing pictures of the critters will make you smile.
4,So cute.,"I give this only 4 stars because it looks WAY bigger in the online photo. ONce it arrived, we loved it but we wished it was a little bigger that is all. Great job."
4,I mean... I'm happy with it,"I think you can get a stuffed otter at this quality at this price in... like any store.This isn't like an extraordinary stuffed otter...I'm happy with itit's soft and allIT""S ACTUALLY REALLY SMALLthat's the only down side i guess"
5,Olivia the Sea Otter goes to School,I bought this puppet for use in a high school class as a focus for an ecology unit. Students get enough of teachers talking and the puppet is very useful in explaining the foraging behaviors of sea otters. It has been a fun toy to use and is big enough for an adult hand. The quality is excellent.
2,Not the size stated,these are stated as 34 x 36 but they are actually 30 x32 so the item does not fit my needs
3,Ok,Bought this several years ago for my accounting law class. Great book because it has old CPA questions. Then when Hurrican Gustave hit I lost the book along with everything else in my car!
2,Erotic as snapping a mouse trap down on your ping ding.,"The picture looks good...other than that GIATB is just another standard softcore skin flick: low production values, horrible ""script"" filled with lame jokes, over the top acting, painful musical numbers and worst of all only one of the five females that get naked you would actually want to see naked.For anybody who's keeping count there were five straight scenes and one lesbian scene. All snoozers and apparently directed by somebody with the sex drive of a wet carrot."
4,Pretty funny stuff,"I actually liked this movie. My wife and I can watch it together and even she thinks it's pretty funny. Yeah, it's a soft core porn flick. But, it's something a couple can watch together and both can enjoy it. There's a whole series of these movies as one of the other reviewers wrote.The acting is pretty over the top. Whether that is on purpose or by accident, I don't know. But, it does keep the whole experience pretty light hearted."
3,Ghost in a Teeny Bikini(2006),"Ghost in a Teeny Bikini(2006) is a funny soft core porn. The film is an homage to the 1966 Deborah Walley movie Ghost in the Invisible Bikini. The film has some laugh out loud moments. Christine Nguyen fishes for a key in human ashes in one scene. She's grossed out to find a pair of dentures! Stock footage from Nosferatu(1922) is used for no good reason. Voodoo, Syren, and Rebecca Love co-star. Ghost in a Teeny Bikini is a sexy comedy done right."
2,Same Cast as the Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet (and not as good),"If you're looking for a fun adult film keep in mind that this is the exact same cast from Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet...but not nearly as good. I recommend their other production and to skip this one, it was more of a nuisance than it was entertaining (and I have admittedly low standards)."
2,"Cheesy, Not Funny.","I was looking for a cheesy, funny movie, like that of Shark Piranha or the like. This is just a movie made to satisfy those looking for loop holes to crappy porn movies."
3,Downloading Problems,"I've seen this movie before and decided to rent it. It is a funny movie and does have a great storyline, but I had downloading issues. It would stop,download and start a few times per scene. It continued to do this, so I stopped watching it. You may or may not have problems with it. I have a Kindle Fire HD and don't know if it was because of that or some other issue."
3,This was fun........,"My wife and I watched this and it was funny and Sexy, It was what you think of when you watch some of these movies, I will say this we had fun afterward... ;D"
3,let down,"Don't get me wrong, it is pretty good for a softcore film but when you know these are hardcore porn actors in this, you get let down by the absence of hardcore. Evan stone is just a gross beast. I don't even like him in hardcore stuff."
4,FREE PIMP C!!!!!,"I finally got this CD delivered. And it was worth the wait. If you skip a track, you must be too high. If Mobb Deep was from Texas, you could really confused these two groups. Thats how tight this Cd is....MURDA MUZIC meets GANGSTA MUSIC!!!"
3,Good theory but short on practical advice,"I enjoyed this book and found it helpful as far as thinking about my parenting theories and the end results I'd like to see. However, I had hoped it would go beyond the theory to offer practical advice at implementing the theories, but it did not. Thus, I do not think it is the most useful book for busy parents! I am hoping the authors' book on boundries is more practical."
5,The Complete Films of John Wayne,One of the best books on John Wayne films that I have everseen. I already own a softback copy and intend on purchasinga hardback copy. I would recommend this to any serious JohnWayne Collector. It gives you a complete history of all thefilms with a list of actors and a short bio of the film withsome pictures.
5,The Complete Films of John Wayne,Purchased the Films of John Wayne in 1975 & about got it warn out. This Complete Films has the last films of John's that were not yet made when my copy came out in 1971 added & I wouldn't be without it. Plan to get them on other actors some day as they are very handy. Not like the computer all the information is correct. I highly recommend this book to everyone as it's the complete book of information on all of John Wayne's movies.
2,No longer a good book,"This pioneering book was written when go was less well-known in the west, and Lasker's access to strong players and to the centuries-old tradition of go teaching was limited. Because present-day authors do not suffer from these disadvantages, recent English-language books tend to be clearer and better organized for beginners. _Go and Go Moku_ also betrays its age by its occasionally nonstandard terminology, which alone is sufficient reason for beginners to avoid this book.Of the many excellent English-language introductions to go, my favorite is Kaoru Iwamoto's _Go For Beginners_."
2,"Examples difficult to follow, dry reading","As a beginner just learning the game, this is not the way to go (sorry). Lasker was world chess champion for 27 years, losing it in 1921. This book is written from that rarified perspective.He will jump into a complex series of moves for a couple of pages, totally losing the reader on the logic and reasons for the progression, and then after another page say the explanation is probably not appropriate for beginners and/or there are many exceptions to what he just wrote. The diagrams are generally hard to follow, and aren't particularly clarified by the accompanying text. There is one complete game recorded move by move between masters Karigane and Honinbo played in 1926 which is instructive. But if this is the first book on go one is exposed to, it might do more to discourage than to help one experience the enjoyment the game can provide."
1,"If you are beginner, look elsewhere...try anything BUT this book!","The last two reviews are right on the mark about this book. If you are a beginner, try anything but this book.The examples are both confusing and hard to follow -- the diagrams do nothing to help. The author's method for noting the moves just adds to the confusion -- he never takes the time to explain it! And it is true -- the text is dry, dry and DRY. The author may know his subject, but it is very hard to extract that knowledge from this book."
3,ugh,"I had to buy this text book for a college course - American Floklife -- and I did not enjoy it. It may be because our professor expected us to know very random and trivial facts from this text, but it also seemed like there were a whole bunch of facts thrown together and bound into a book. It felt like the author was going off on tangents or getting distracted, and never really got to the point they were trying to make.. in every, single, chapter. It read better than a ""regular"" textbook -- but I felt like I was either reading in circles or I was just plain confused because it jumped to a new argument without finishing the last one.Gives you what you need for class, but that's about it."
5,Great introduction to the study of folklore,"Finally, an introduction-to-folklore textbook that doesn't read like a textbook. The clarity, illustrations, and organization of this book are perfect for folklore students. I wish I had a book like this when I was a beginning student."
1,Ugh,"I had to buy this book for a course in college, or else I probably would have never even looked at this book. I imagine anyone else who is buying this book is in the same boat as me, if so, then good luck. If you don't absolutely have to buy this book for a course, then don't. It is boring, confusing to read, and never really clarifies anything. The author explains what folklore isn't, not what it is. They explain why folklorists methods don't really work, not which ones do work. Everytime I have to read for an assignment I come out feeling just a little more stupid than I was before. Do not buy this book unless you have to!!!"
2,Amatuerish,"A not so successful attemp of another ""the future after armageddon"" genre. A few good concepts but delivered in style more fit for ... umm .. intellectually deficient?"
4,Good insight into his playing with some useful ideas,"I'm a professional touring guitarist as well as a clinician, and a big Mike Stern fan. I liked hearing Mike talk about his approach to playing, and the examples that he gives are really useful. This is not a lesson DVD as much as it is an interview with performance shots and explanations about what he is doing. You can definitely walk away with a few new licks and useful ideas. As I find with most videos, if you learn only one useful thing from it, it is an incredible value."
1,Mike Stern: Guitar Instructional Video?,As a guitar instructional video this Mike Stern's DVD is very poor. It teaches almost nothing. If I knew it I wouldn't buy it!
5,A Fantastic Read,"It's an incredible book. Hilarious, heartwarming and with characters you immediately fall in love with. No boring parts anywhere between the pages. The story just pulls you in from pg 1. I've gone through all of Fiona Walker's books and can't wait for her next one."
4,Excellent!! a real page turner!!,"I read this book last summer on holiday quite by chance and was hooked immediately!! I have also now read French Relations and Snap Happy and I am equally impressed with the characters and storylines, they take you off into another world and are real page turners. I have recommended this author to my friends."
5,What Fun! Hated to see it end!,"I stumbled apon this book by accident, and feel as if I am carrying around my own little secret! Fiona Walker is brilliant and I felt like crying when the book was over. I just didn't want to say goodbye, especially to Felix! This is one of those rare gems that a book lover like me never wants to lend, for fear that they won't get it back!"
3,Not her best,"Fiona Walker lets herself down with this book, it can be boring and the story line is silly. Having said that, I read the book and while its not the most enjoyable book that I have ever read, it is midly enjoyable"
4,Quite entertaining for me.,"David Thompson finally puts to an end the problem of Zach and his personal outlooks. I think the way he did it in this book surprised me in a good way because I never would have guessed his method. If you liked this book and want to read more of his works then you might want to read the whole series. I give David Thompson two thumbs up for this series and this book!! He displays the daily hardships and wilderness as what is really was, dangerous and unpredictable. I think Mr. Thompson has done a good job and needs to keep it up. Thank you!!!A loyal Wilerness Series fan."
2,McKamey video,"While the music is good, and I do like the group; there is not much ""banter"" or other entertainment except for the songs. I have come to expect a little more ""personality"" in videos."
3,Solid Performer.,"While not the best of the series, Castle Murders is far from the worst and for any self-respecting fan a must read. Presented with the same wit and pacing as the other books, Castle Murders offers a subtle but not unplesant deparcher from the other seven books.Filled with twist and turns, both obvious and devious Castle Murders is a typical Castle Perlious book....just a lot of fun to read."
4,A great read,"This book read like a newspaper article, never slowing down, always keeping you interested. Be careful though, after I read it I immediately got the urge to go out search for that ever elusive copy of my latest must have... Darn you gemm.com and your great marketplace pricing... If you are a vinyl junkie like me beware, you may just head over to gemm as well... Great read and a fascinating look at what makes the junkie inside all of us tick."
1,Don't Bother,"Reads like a magazine article padded out to book length. Completely disposable. For record collectors like me, it says nothing new. For the rest it won't mean much. Don't bother, unless you see it in a bargain bin for $2 (which you probably will.)"
3,what more?,"The velvet underground & nico _ joe harvardVinyl junkie _ brett milanoIf you consider yourself addicted to vinyl & those around you see your passion as something strange. This book is a treat, in it you will read stories about people who would need 2 or 3 life times to just hear the records they have accumulated or others that would fork out $4.000 for an odd 7 inch, not to mention one unbelievable story about a Hendrix collector who has in his prized record collection one that could contain Hendrix's dna.Yes, vinyl record collector you are not alone."
4,For people who are [...] about their music,"If you read and/or watched High Fidelity and thought, ""That's me!"", then this book is for you. Keep a pad of paper with you as you read, because you'll learn about some interesting collectibles you never knew existed. The segments where rock stars talk about their personal history/obsession with record collecting are particularly fun. Milano has an easy-going style that makes it feel like you're having a private conversation about a topic close to both your hearts. The best place to buy this book would be a used record store, but do get it."
5,A nice collection,"It took me awhile to get used to the traditional lute tab notation as I am coming from a regular guitar background (read standard notation & ""modern"" tablature). This is a good book if you can find it. If you also like steel-string acoustic guitar playing, check out the recordings and transcriptions by John Renbourne. There is another book that may be hard to find but worth it called ""Complete Anthology for Medieval and Renaissance Guitar"" that has some great transcriptions using alternate tunings by Renbourne."
1,thin post fell out,"The pearls are beautiful, but the posts are noticeably thinner than on other earrings. With less surface area to grip the pearl, one of them just fell out upon first use. The packaging is too cheesy for this price point: a fake-velour sachet sitting on a piece of styro-fluff. We sent ours back."
1,Horrible,The earrings fell apart the third time my wife wore them and Amazon wouldn't refund them because it was past the 30-day return policy. Expensive junk.
1,"Horrible, Horrible","Anyone who can give this book above a one star rating is just too easy to please. Don't waste your money on this. It's a convuluted mess and I forced myself to push on through page after page hoping against hope that it would get better. The ending was a big let down especially after forcing my way through the book. The only thrilling part of the book was reading ""The End""."
5,Feliz customer,I bought this truck fo my son. It arrived on time and it was the best experience i had so far on teh internet. Usually i feel scare to buy something because (you are not very sure on what you will get).The money was well spent on this little toy; my boy loves it. It came with everything i need.Mil Grasias.Rubio Shakopee MN
2,Wild open and big,This thing is big and looks bad but I had to return it due to some problems right out of the box. After I charged the batteries and took it outside for a test the truck ran wide open. I changed the bands numerous times because they have 4 that you can choose from on the remote and the truck. It still ran out of control and wide open only ten feet from me. It was picking up waves from somewhere so we could not use this toy. The truck slammed into the curb at full speed and was just dangerous. Don't think that you are going to get any support from the New Bright Customer Service either.
4,Comprehesive and useful,"This is a good reference for educators to use when planning their word study lessons. I use the error guides to determine my skills-based spelling groups; this is very time saving and provides great insight into the individual child. I also use the McGuffy spelling assessment. Between the two, I have a great grasp on my students' word study skills. There are many great activities and games for all abilities. This is a good source for open and closed word sorts. Charts and game are very useful. Definitely teacher-friendly and well laid out."
4,Great Activities and Ideas,This is a wonderful book for parents and teachers alike. There are many wonderful ideas for developing a variety of interesting and engaging phonics activities.
3,Words Their Way,"The book was in Great condition, but I did Not reveive the CD that is supposed to be attached to the back."
1,One Sharp Brush,"This brush feels like a bunch of unfolded paper clips rubbing on your scalp. I don't normally have a soft head but this thing hurts! The bristles are very sharp and hardly bend. If you like sharp edges scraping your head this may be the brush for you, otherwise look elsewhere."
4,A great introduction,"I have a hard time understanding how anyone who has read this book can find Mclaren to be ""an emergent heretic not affirming the physical resurrection of Christ."" This book is a friendly and concise introduction to the study of the historical Jesus. It is illuminating and not at all heretical. Have the people who speak this way read the book or are they just going off of what their local homogenized Christian subculture says? N.T. Wright and Dallas WIllard are two of my favorite teachers, one reason why I resonated so strongly with this book as Mclaren thanks them for the majority of the content in his writing."
5,Convinced,"Yes. Being an 80 year-old retired preacher of the gospel, I was convinced by the angry negative blogs by scriptural literalists to order this book. Thank you all whose minds are closed to any new ideas (which just might be closer to the truth than the ones you locked away in your closed minds)! And thanks also to those who made the effort to pinpoint what you found helpful in the book."
2,Where's the Secret?,"Though parts of this book were interesting spin on the Jesus message, where was the secret. For the most part, the author spun what many others have been saying Jesus' message was and is for centuries. I guess it was to sell books?"
3,The secret message is within us....,"If there is a secret message of Jesus--and McLaren is right in offering something to those made curious by the DV Code--it is within us.And we are keeping it, rather, ""Him,"" too much of a secret.Jesus sits today beside God. Who, then, dwells in us who ""receive Jesus as Lord and Savior""?The Holy Spirit.For more detail, read _The Power!_ by James Bramlett, _The Holy Spirit and You_ by Dennis Bennett and _Surprised by the Power of the Spirit_ by Jack Deere deal with manifesting the Spirit-filled life--the life of Jesus within us, doing ""all things whatsoever I [Jesus] have commanded you to do,"" ""to the end of the world,"" Matthew 28.And these three books reveal the true and startling secret--the Holy Spirit's ""whatsoever"" called for in Matthew 28 and summed up in Matthew 10 in startling contrast to some ""traditions of men."""
1,quasi-christianity lite for cultural consumption,"The only good that can be said for this book is emphasis on living consistently with Christ's principles of love.4 stars deducted for skimming over the Bible's emphasis on Jesus living a perfect life and dying a sacrificial death perfectly substituting in our sinful place. This alone, and a person's faith in Jesus' God-man perfection and righteousness before Holy God, empowers living like Christ lived.If only the little letter of First John was quoted as much as Willard-Wink-Wright, we would have a more honest authentic grasp of the Whole Jesus and His Original message direct from heaven.""This is love, not that we started off loving God, but instead God took all initiative by loving us first and sending His Son from Heaven as the atoning substituting lamb-sacrifice regarding our sins...Whoever has the Son has eternal life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have the life."""
4,Thought-provoking and motivational,"This book is thought-provoking and motivational. It has encouraged me to read the scriptures regarding Jesus' preaching and teaching. And, to follow those teachings."
3,Still Waiting,"As a curoisity I picked up this book just to see what was inside. Of course, there's a ton of books that have come out now after Dan Brown's DaVinci Code. So, I get this and start reading. What surprised me or really didn't was that there wasn't anyhting new here. In fact, I'm still waiting for the big secret message that is suppossedly written here and that Jesus kept so-called secret. Please. The message is simple (it's only if we really want to practice what Jesus taught)and this book is just another's opinion of what Jesus taught while here on the earth with us. Maybe, I'm missing it but I found the book to be a little boring, very slow-paced and trite. If this book uncovers the truth that could change everything I guess the church I attend is doing everything all wrong then."
5,Thought-provoking,"Intriguing and thought-provoking! This book will cause you to reconsider what you believe about Jesus whether you are a skeptic, a seeker, or a committed believer. McLaren writes as a evangelical Christian who willing to distrust the current conservative understanding of Christianity. He speaks to those who are curious but turned off by the Church or the Christian message as well as to Christians who have never really thought through what they believe."
5,A clear voice in a dead religion,"I loved this book. Largely based on Jesus' teaching on the Kingdom. Brian looks at not only on what Jesus said, but the context in which he said them. Well thought out and put together, povocativeand truly a calm voice in a messed up system, Brian has told Jesus message like none I have ever heard. I would suggest reading this book for yourself to see if it deserves the bad press it seems to have atracted by some. If you, like me, have been wondering what this whole Jesus thing is about, here is an excellent place to start.Thanks for a great book Mr. McLaren!"
1,Arrogance beyond belief!,"The author acts as if he has found some secret message that the church has missed. He even goes through the whole history of the church and explains why and how each age of the the church has missed this message. But the message he is promoting is something that all Christians of all times and places have embraced. That God is good and his kingdom advances when we are changed by God and act accordingly in our personal lives. The tone of the book is humble, but the message is very arrogant. If it was a ploy to get the message out in this age of supposed new discoveries about the ancient church, (Which is really just the ancient gnostic cult), the that would be cool, but he actually believes he as uncovered the TRUE Gospel hidden in the words of the bible and missed by all until he came along to explain it. Very dangerous and worrisome to me..."
1,1/2 Star Is Being Very Generous,"I've done some research and it's true. Looks like there is a movement to up the ratings for this book. About a dozen or so fans were sent advance copies to offer positive reviews to keep interest going.It took some doing, but I as a non-fan finished reading what the latest theologic fashion trend claimed to be. Not that impressive. Lots of sentiment and suggestion, but little on the level of revolutionary.What I found was neocolonialiberalistrendoctrinairethicality trying to substitute for biblical discipleship in the Fellowship of the CROSS.What does it profit someone who tries to gain the whole world and yet forfeits one's soul? What can you give in exchange for your soul?I resolve to know nothing except Jesus Christ and him Crucified!"
1,"The ""Secret"" is how this author is successful","puh-leese!!! this book is only provocative for those easily provoked. McClaren introduces nothing new to those who are more informed than those who would find this book innovative. McClaren, obviously, was the goofy intellectual wannabee in college who sat around and took notes on what the intellectuals were saying, rewrote their stuff so that it made no coherent sense, and then presented it to a publisher who is all goo-goo over Davinci Code stuff. The only secret, here, is the punchline. The obvious joke is, of course, this book!"
2,Metaphoria too subtle for substantive engagement,"Difficult to digest. Looks like trying to find a metaphor under every bible verse that has hidden secret meaning only divulged to the inner circle of expert linguists.The real secret message of the real Jesus is: Unless you repent of your sins, you will perish. See Luke 13.I couldn't find in this metaphoria any mention of the absolute necessity to worship Jesus as Lord. A genuine Christian is a Christ-worshiper. It seems like there is a subtle substitute of revering and regarding Jesus, but not bowing down to the Lamb in the center of God the Father's Throne as co-worthy of adoration, praise and worship. See Revelation 5:8-14.I liked the cover art and some of the sections on Christians getting out of their comfort zones to be more missional and engaging of a lost world in need of God's love. Thus 2 stars."
1,BEWARE!!!!!!!FALSE PREACHER,"Mclaren preaches what secular people want to hear, everyone must read the bible to understand the Truth.I rated this a one because it asked for a rating. Otherwise I would of given it a zero. Read Gods word, don't rely secondhand. Question preachers who say they don't understand the Bible."
4,Great Introduction to the Kingdom of God,"This book is written on a level that is very accessible and easily understandable. Therefore, I would recommend it if you haven't read much on the Kingdom of God and/or Jesus' message before. You may find McLaren's writing to be somewhat less ""loaded"" or profound than other writing on similar themes (take, for instance, that of N.T. Wright or Donald Miller). However, it still strikes some very relevant chords and makes some inspirationally ""radical"" observations. The thematic strands are very well laid out and easy to follow. A good read, all around."
1,Unlikely to succeed with serious Bible students,"I consider myself a serious Bible student. This volume fell far short of serious engagement with the deep heart's core crux of Jesus' teachings.The pick-and-choose approach to which Gospel texts to use to make his points is frankly disingenuous.The subjectively selective reinterpretation of a small portion of what Jesus said is as revolutionary as what Thomas Jefferson the skeptic-deist did with his ""Jefferson Bible"" (see listing on amazon.com)This little treatise is ideal for those seeking the non-threatening culturally popular love & acceptance & peacemaking & other cheek turning non-violent resistence unintended martyrdom excerpts of the teachings of the Lord without having to accept the Lord of the teachings."
2,False teaching,"What a louzy book. There is no secret message of Jesus. What Jesus has to say is completely found in God's Word, the Bible. It is the message of repentant faith found solely in the Savior, Jesus-- only one way for salvation. McLaren is very misinformed and trusts humanistic/ecumenical ideas and reinterprets sola scripture. Stay away from this book. It is completely flawed. God to God's Word. It alone is sufficient!"
1,DERAILED TRAIN OF THOUGHT,"One can only prayerfully sympathize with this writer and his readers who ride this derailed train of thought.Jesus clearly declared, My kingdom is not of this world, but now my kingdom is from another place. You are right in saying I am a King. In fact, for this reason I was born and came into this world, to testify to the Truth. Everyone on Truth's side listens to me.Jesus commands us to choose sides. Whoever is not with Jesus is against Jesus. He came not to bring peace on earth, but a sword that divides and separates into 2 sides: Truth or antitruth.That choice is ours today. Which side are we on?"
3,Rachel and Her Children,"Wonderfully written- wish there was a 2010 edition, all the stats are outdated, but already depressing and frustrating...I'm curious as to see how about 20 years has changed things. It's extremely depressing, but I guess that's how things are when you work with those who have no hope and no place to call ""home""...."
4,Great for the do-it-yourselfer,This is one of those picture books for someone who has never painted anything before. NOT FOR a pro. I ended up skimming some of it. But There were a few points mentioned that would be helpful to someone who has never painted before. So if you are looking to fix up that living room or siding in this tight market and have never painted... try this.
5,I'VE LOVE THIS BOOK. AND I'VE READ OVER A DOZEN.,"This is my most treasured painting bible.My house is a mess. Virtually everything needs serious work. Dixon gives me the confidence to tackle one project after another. His writing style is straightforward, reassuring, inspirational. He tells you everything you need to know to complete a job and be happy with it. Every painstaking stage of prep, helpful tips on additives, priming, carrying out each stage of painting process under every possible circumstance. I borrowed Dixon's book from the library so often that I spent more than the cost of it on overdue fines.Now it's mine. All mine."
3,Not organized as a reference,this is more of a sit down over coffee and listen to the author talk about how he does things. Its really not organized in a useable way if you're looking for instruction.
5,Put it on and Start Sobbing in your Beer,"Oh, man, is this one GOOD. ""Nobody Knows the Way I Feel this Morning"" and ""Muddy Water"" will have you shouting along. It's well, well worth the listen."
2,Vile,"I received a box of these for free at some sort of promotion. Don't be fooled by the Oreo logo on the box--these things taste somewhat like a vaguely chocolate-flavored lump of old paste. They're truly disgusting, but I have to give them two stars because they do manage to stave off hunger for brief periods of time."
2,Yucky..,"I bit into one of these bars expecting at least SOMEWHAT of an Oreo flavor. Boy, was I wrong! Yuck! The texture is okay, but the tast is just... lacking in every way. I especially think this is because you're expecting to find some type of Oreo flavor. If you get it for free for some reason, take it... otherwise, spend your money on other 100 calorie packs. The Orea 100 calorie BITES are much better than these."
5,Yet another national disgrace.,"Perpetrator of these atrocities, University of Pennsylvania's ""Dr."" Albert Kligman, is the second physician in FDA history to be barred from experimenting on human subjects. Both Retin-A and Renova are derivatives of skin hardening chemicals he concocted at Holmesburg Prison. This merciless freak experimented on hospitalized retarded children and helpless elderly patients as well. Never apologized to his tortured victims or their families.I am permanently boycotting Retin-A, Renova, Johnson & Johnson and Dow Chemical. U. Penn will never get a dime from me either. All of them continue to profit greatly from wanton destruction of human lives."
3,An okay cologne,"I got this cologne for my dad as one of his birthday gifts. As a guy, I know you can never have enough cologne. I had never smelled this cologne, but the reviews were all pretty good and the price for the size of the bottle seemed very reasonable, so I took a shot. When we opened the cologne to smell it, I was a bit indifferent. At first, it has sort of a funky smell to it, but after a bit of settling into your skin/clothes, the smell seems to get better. I feel I have a pretty good taste in cologne seeing as I have a ton of different brands myself, but can't say I would purchase this for myself or anyone else again. However, I wouldn't classify this cologne as terrible, just nothing special."
1,Smells like urine,This is the worst smelling crap I have on my shelf. I don't use it except to wash grease and oil off my hands after working on my car.
4,"Best ""daily"" smell good","This has been my favorite daily cologne for about 16 years.The larger size is a better buy. I buy both, as the smaller bottles are refillable."
1,Paul Sebastian,"Appears to have been watered down, does not smell like PS cologne. The package was not sealed like a new package would have been. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Stinky smells like fake imposter junk,"I used Paul Sebastian in the past and this stuff ain't the same. Smells like bad old spice stale barber shop crap. Very unhappy with this. the bottle doesn't have the words ""fine cologne"" on it like in the picture, that is why I think it's fake. Go to a retail store and sample it in person, pay for it there and support your local economy. Do not buy this via amazon, no return policy doesn't help when the sent you bought smells like your dead uncle!"
5,Great Scent!!,A long lasting but not over bearing cologne. It stays with you all day!! Great for everyday or weekends!! Classic smell.
1,s,"This product arrived and had a leak and the top was full of dried up gunk in a sealed package. I used Amazon's return option and its says.""The items for this order are displayed below.

5,Wonderful Fragrance!,I was thrilled to find PS by Paul Sebastian on Amazon. This is the favorite fragrance of the men in my family but is so very hard to find elsewhere.
3,its a good value,"paul sebastian is a good value if your looking for a lower priced fragrance that has some kick to it..a bit of an alcohol smell when you first put it on, but, it settles in and is actually a decent smell and a great value for the money..not as nice as the higher end products but you get what you pay for...nice to keep around for everyday casual wear but if your looking for something more unique and classy, try lalique or the other higher end products...this is a good value, however, and i am satisfied with it for what i paid"
1,Great Scent-- Do NOT buy from Amazon,"I have used Paul Sebastian for at least 8 years-- I ordered two bottles from Amazon and both had ""turned"" the scent was non-existent. Amazon does not take returns on this product because it is considered a hazardous material. That would be correct the scent is hazardous and nothing like what is available in the store. Buyer beware when purchasing fragrance online."
5,No Other will do,"Love it! Started using this when I was in my mid to late twenties, I'm 51 now so and in 30 yrs the complements keep on coming. For me there is no other. PS is my life sentence."
2,"Cute, but not rugged!","We tried this tool kit out on assembling IKEA furniture. The screwdriver did not have an attachment long enough to work; we had to borrow tools for that. This would probably work for hanging pictures around the house and other light work, but not good for much else. Probably better to save your money and buy good quality tools a little at a time."
3,Decent basic tool set,"This is a decent small tool set, but don't let the 135 piece fool you, they're counting every screw bit and even the bit case. This set does not have a regular screw driver, only a small electric screwdriver. I bought this for my mother because her husband kept taking her tool sets and not putting them away, so far I don't believe he's taken any of her new pink tools, but this is a toolset if you do very light work around the house, not for major projects."
4,Girl Power,"This is the third tool kit I've ordered. They were gifts for my adult daughters and stepdaughter. This was the one gift that had the best reaction at Christmas; and the daughter who had received it months ago as a birthday gift went on and on describing how much she has used hers. Everyone needs tools around the house, and the fact that these are organized and pink make them the perfect set for a young woman. I will continue to keep this set in mind for future women in need!"
1,Princess Tool Kit,I got the tools in a box that had a broken latch. They replaced the box in a timely fashion but the tools would not fit in the new box. When I called they more or less blew me off. Will never buy from them again.
2,tool kit,"The product was just okay, it does not have a manual screw driver, which could have been better to have."
2,"Good, but Not NEW!","This item showed up in a timely fashion and in Good condition, but it was by no means NEW! The case was scuffed and scratched, and at least with the hammer the tools were obviously used. Otherwise a pleasant purchasing experience."
2,What happened?,Can't review what didn't work very long. I ordered specifically for the power screwdriver and it worked for bout a minute then died. Tried to charge it...no go very displeased!
3,Half decent tool set aside from the drill,"I purchased this set when I moved away from home - and from Dad's tools. It seemed to have everything I needed for light repair work and was totally cute! Two years later, I'm still semi-sold.The cordless drill (or, more correctly, the cordless screwdriver) quit working two weeks after I bought it, which was a major pain. After a month or so, I tried to charge it again, and it did start working. It has worked sporadically since then with absolutely no rhyme or reason, the only constant being that it needs several hours of charging for it to have even the slightest chance of working.The rest of the set works well and is good enough for light work. My husband keeps his hands off since everything is bright pink, which means I can always find a set of pliers or a hammer when I need one. I use his tool set when I need a screwdriver or a drill, though."
4,Fun Basic Kit,"Some tools like the hammer and screw driver are miniature, and won't hold up with normal wear on big projects, but this is a great starter kit. It saved me a lot of money on getting started on my DIY and basic home projects, and proved to be very handy and compact. Great to keep under the kitchen sink for little projects instead of hunting in the garage for the right tools. Great Dad gift for Daughter leaving home."
4,decent girl tools,"to me it was worth paying more to have cuter tools, but i do have a tinge of regret because the drill died after 5 minutes of use. you are forewarned."
4,As advertised,I bought this for my wife for Christmas. Tools seem sturdy enough so far and it's a nice varied set of tools. That coupled with the fact that my wife is a little obsessed with the color pink made these actually a nice gift.
2,Case and tools look like they been sitting in someone's dirty garage,I purchased these so I would always have a set of tools handy and wouldn't have to search for them in the random places my husband keeps them. This set was disappointing. The case was dirty and scratched. The electric screwdriver (no way it's powerful enough to be a drill) is also discolored. I am debating on whether I should send this back because the items hardly look to be new.
3,"Quality, Except for Poor Workmanship","This tool kit has all of the hand tools and a few more that a (more likely woman) will need. I have so far found all of the tools to be sturdy and well designed.Upon opening my Apollo Tool Box, I immediately noticed the poor workmanship. All of the tools have a CHINA print or label on them, as the entire kit was Made in China. There are unfinished edges to the plastic pieces (flakes or rough edges). The tools overall have the appearance of coming through a factory line and immediately being put in the box, without a final check.All tools have proved durable (though I have only had this for a month) but the presentation of the tools is surprisingly poor. Perhaps the appearance is of no concern to some, but if given as a gift, this tool box may look ""cheap"" due to the workmanship."
4,Love it!,"$36 for so many useful tools (including extra nails!!!), so you shouldn't be expecting the best of quality. However, it is literally one of the best purchases I've made. I am not using this to build a robotic car or a treehouse. For that, I'd get a Black & Decker or a DeWalt. I use this to hang paintings on the wall, assemble my Ikea furniture, and do little sparse things around the house. And it's so cute, so I have the best time doing it. I really would spend $36 on the electronic screwdriver alone. It is powerful and has good battery life. Really good product. And keep in mind that a better quality toolkit like this can cost a couple of hundreds of dollars."
2,Apollo Precision Tools - upgraded to electric and it didn't work,"I was looking at 2 kits and decided to pay a little more for the electric drill. The first time I used it, it worked for a minute and then stopped. I charged it for a day and it still didn't work. By accident I threw away the product documents, I hope I can still get it replaced without push back."
2,UNHAPPY,I am not happy with this product. The screwdriver does not work at all I charged it and nothing. The button doesnt even push down and I have tried to call customer service several times and got no answer and left several messages and no response back. It would be fine if I could get a replacement screwdriver over even have this one fixed but like I said no response so I am a very unhappy customer!~
4,Good tools,"I received this kit as a Christmas gift 2 years ago and have used it a lot!!! It has served its purpose well. I have hardly used the ""utility / exacto knife"" as it feels VERY light-weight, as though it would break with the first use.I used the putty knife to hammer out the caulking from around 20+ windows, and many other things. The finish on the metal end has worn off from the repeated hammer hits, but still functions great! The bits have held up very well but were a little slick at first due to the chrome-like finish. I have worn out the PH#2, but then again, it's most commonly used.Overall, I am quite pleased with it. Use it for most of my home renovations and remodels. And get lots of comments on the color when people see it."
2,Easily Found in Their Proper Place!,"As a gal who can't stand waiting until my ""he-men"" get around to fixing things, I prefer to fix things myself. This toolbox is just OK for small things around the house. Definitely not a beefy tool box for MOST things around the house. It is PINK, a saving grace, the guys tend not to want to be caught dead carrying OR using PINK girly tools *YIPPEE*.Gettng my drift about disappearing tools that fail to find their way back to my tool box? NOTHING is worse than having to fix something and your tools are nowhere to be found. Dumb looks and IDA, IDA KNOW, the only response you get from the assumed guilty parties. I'd like beefier tools in PINK. It would save me from hiding tools so I can find them when I need them!I gave 2 stars because of price point... only worth less than 20 bucks."
2,Cute but useless,"I had to revise my review because I rated the previous one I bought for this one. This one is okay but think about what you will be needing it for. The drill is useless. If you need it because you are going to be assembling furniture and stuff by yourself, then don't get this for the drill. I wouldn't have minded if it had screwdrivers but it comes with no screw drivers. It has the miniature ones that work for toys and stuff but nothing useful. I charged the drill overnight even, it worked for maybe a minute but didn't do the job. I couldn't get not one screw off my chair. The drill is just too weak for the job. I borrowed a neighbors drill and the screws came off in seconds. There is no wrench or anything really useful in this toolbox. Waste of money, but it is cute."
4,Great little tool box,"This tool box has been great. It arrived right before I moved to a new apartment and was invaluable in taking apart my Ikea furniture and pulling out wall mounts for shelves and pictures. The cordless electric screw-driver is an excellent addition, although a manual one would also have been nice."
3,Great except for screwdriver device,Everything in the kit is great except for the battery powered screwdriver. It does not have enough torque to actually screw in and unscrew anything so now I need to buy a screw driver set. Torn between giving it 2 and 3 stars.
3,Does the DO,I ordered this for my new place and it has actually come in pretty handy for little things around the apt. I wanted pink & it is cute & for the price it is doing what i want it to do!!
3,Pink is Cool,"Fun for what it is, a pink tool set. It has everything you would need. I have not had a chance to use it, so I cann't report on quality."
3,Cute but not for real use,"This was a gift for my daughter and I wish it had been better made. The tools are only good for very light work. Good for changing toy batteries, small tacks, etc. Got this because of the pink color. Hoping it would prevent her husband from ""borrowing"" her tools. Won't have to worry about that. These tools won't work for any real jobs."
5,Perfect,This product has everything that I Could need. They drilled is easy To be used to build desk or other pre-Packaged Items that need to be built. The drill is not it's heavy duty enough to cause damage to those type of drillings. All of the accessories are very useful and very helpful. I'm glad there are included in this product
1,Tools not to be taken seriously,"These tools are meant to be given to someone as a joke I think, not for anyone to do anything meaningful around a home. They are made of flimsy plastic and weak metal. The screws I have encountered in my home were more durable than the screwdriver head -- the metal on the tool stripped up rather than the screw, so the tools were ruined in first use. The drill is a complete joke since it has zero power to even assemble pre-drilled holes for screws -- again, the screw lasted longer than the drill bit. VERY, VERY disappointed in this. I'm sure someone else out there has pink tools for women that are not a complete flop. Why else would there be people selling their used sets from this very web-site!"
1,"""Toy Tools""","I asked for a set of tools for Mother's Day. I do a lot of decorating and home repair. Most of the time I have trouble finding my husband's tools. When I do find them some are too heavy and awkward for me to use (drill, battery charged screw driver, etc..).I was extremely disappointed with the Appollo 135pc tool set. It reminds me of a toy set I bought for my son when he was 10 and wanted to help Dad with repairs. The pliers and wrench are too small for my grip and the hammer is smaller than I thought it would be. If you're looking to hang up some pictures this would be fine. But if you're looking to do more than that I would not recommend this set."
1,NOT worth the money!,"I've got to agree with the other negative reviews. These tools are like toys, made out of flimsy materials. I do not understand how others are getting any use out of them. The screwdrivers were the first to break, the metal they are made out of is so soft that after putting together a few children's toys they were completely ruined. The cordless screwdriver (""drill"") has NO power, and after a handful of uses it will not hold a charge. The plastic piece on the tape measure broke off so it can not be held in place. Even the pink plastic hinges on the case broke off. The only thing I've found really useful in this set is the hammer, and well, that's not worth the price. For this amount of money you could buy yourself some real tools, forget about these even though they look so cute. I'm sorry I got them."
2,The Electric screwdriver doesn't charge.,The apollo precision tool set contained an electric screwdriver that will not charge. The rest of the tool set works as it is desinged.
4,Great for around inside of the house!,"I love my pink tool kit. It works great for all the things I have needed for the last 5 years around the house. Most of it I wouldn't use for real outdoor work, but the hand drill did come in handy in a pinch when my electric drill went down while building my fence. This kit is perfect for the indoor ""handylady"". I have used it for so many minor repairs I can't count. I have not had the screwdriver bits strip and I have used them in my electric drill on some tough spots. The variety of things in the kit that you never think you need has been great! I never knew I would need the plumber tape but guess what....I so did.Right now I am buying this as a wedding gift for a friend because every woman should have her own kit and know how to use it ;)"
2,Joke Tool Set?,"Yes, I agree with the other reviews noting this to be a joke, worthless tool set. Some things, like the tape measure and the teeny-tiny level, are useful, but that's about it - I can easily buy those items separately for a much cheaper price. The drill is worthless - in fact, mine has never gathered enough power to perform any function. The hammer is far too short in the handle, resulting in it being off-balance and quite difficult to use. Please pay attention to the detailed reviews that others have posted on this - I agree wholeheartedly with them!! Spend your money on a different tool set, or just go buy the pieces independently at the hardware store and keep them in a cute pink bag or box."
2,Not good quality,The essential tools that are needed in there are the screw drivers and they are so small that they bent the first time I used them! They are good if you are giving them as a gift to a child but not for an adult who wants to use them at home or work. And they took almost a month to get to me11
3,Not for serious household tasks,"I have been using the Tool Kit for a move into a new apartment. It is handy having the tools in one place and most of the tools are fine for smaller projects (hanging pictures, blinds, etc). My biggest complaint is the battery powered screwdriver; it doesn't work for anything but the lightest of projects. The drill kept losing power as I tried to attach brackets to a small table. I had to go out and buy a regular screwdriver to finish the project. My advice is to have some other tools available."
3,"Nice price, but quality a little lacking.","I bought this to keep my husband from putting my tools in his tool box. I got tired of looking for my hammer. I like the carrying case. The quality is average, but for the price, it is about what I expected. I took it to help 8 and 9 year olds build book-ends and they wanted the pink hammer. They thought it was cool. Go-figure. Seriously though, for the small tasks I do around the house it is great. I love the battery powered screw driver and the variety of screw driver attachements. There are four small screw drivers that are cheap and I don't anticipate they will last too long. I think they are supposed to be used for eye glass repair and such. The needle nose pliers are hard to use and I pinched my finger, but that might be my lack of skill."
3,Apollo Precision Tools,"The case was damaged when it arrived. Because this was a gift, I did not really inspect the product. The receiver is very disappointed in this product."
5,Perfect!,"Love this little tool kit! Small but has all the right tools for the small household stuff like hanging pictures, changing batteries in the kids' toys!"

3,"Okay, but not Great","I was a bit disappointed in these books, because I love the Crown/Court Duel books so much. These are not like them at all. They seem to be for much younger girls, and there's no romance or anything.And it was weird but I did not really like Wren. I know I was meant to, but she just seemed like too much of a typical, plucky, orphaned heroine - and she was too matter of fact and accepting of all these amazing events. It wasn't realistic, and I know it's fantasy, but shouldn't the characters still feel real?I have only read these books once - and I re-read EVERYTHING - so that tells you that they're not that great. But they are probably okay for younger readers."
1,Faulty Lock,"I purchased this lock a year ago, which has worked find up until yesterday. I came home from work and the device had been broken off with the lock still intact."
4,Works Just Fine,"This item works as it's supposed to...do not understand the claims of it being faulty. Maybe they just are not installing it correctly, or using an appropriate lock. But it will keep your water from being stolen; and like any security device, if the thief wants it bad enough, he'll find away to get it."
1,This does not work,"I got this and guess what does not work, it looks really nice on when installed but the thing is that when you put a lock on it you can remove it with lock included."
1,Hose Bibb Locks,I have used this before but I was unable to find it locally in Ct. On Amazon I was able to find it the product works great and I have recommend it to friends.
2,Quality not so great,Quality not so great; hard to write on the board and clean it up. Easy to use though and good combination between the board and the pen
4,Revelations tarot + book,"This deck is interesting because the cards are double-ended, with an upright and reversed image merging in the center of the card; it makes easier to grasp the meaning of the reverse cards. It's a traditional tarot deck, with 78 cards; there are two extra cards with illustrations of the Horoscope Spread and the Seven Days Spread (that are explained also in the book). The backs of the cards are dark blue, with a symmetrical swirling pattern (so you can't tell if the card is upright or reversed).The book is black and white. It displays a small picture of the card, upright meaning, reverse meaning, and a descripcion of the image and symbolism.Mine came with two sun cards an none page of wand card, so I made a proxy with one of the spare cards and a picture I found in zach wong website."
5,revelations tarot,I think for the people hwo read this kind of boks this is one of the most important to know
4,Very nice,"The whimsical artwork is good, but where this deck really shines is in its concept: there is no way to see a card as being upside down, as artwork goes both ways. People who aren't very familiar with tarot often get anxious about card reversals, as if the card's direction implies bad outcomes if upside down. This deck elininates that hurdle entirely, and encourages readers to show that reversals are merely the other side of the coin. Very nice."
4,NOt quite sure yet,"I love the idea of these cards although I rarely read reversals. I love the back of the cards! I like the design as well, but seems just a little more cartoony than I prefer. I do need to work them more to be fair. I find them interesting and, if nothing else, will be a neat deck to go to when I am bored of the usual decks."
5,Fun for adults too!,This is the greatest version of Uno! We played it one night with just adults (there had been a few Margaritas involved) and it was much better than the normal version! The rules have you forcing people to take cards all the time - it's very evil! Steal it from your kids - we highly recommend it!
3,Cut him some slack...,"The author and I come from the same Mennonite decendant, buried just outside Harrisonburg, Va. I don't know if he is still a practicing Mennonite or not; I am not. But one should take into account the pacifist back ground of the Annabaptists may explain the underlying tone of the narrative.I grew up with a lot of anecdotes too. Like my great great grand mother protesting over the taking of her hogs by Union troopers to a grizzled veteran of Sheridan's army who replied, ""You should be glad we aren't taking you too..."" The implication being obvious. The Edinburg Mill my father's home town, still bears scorch marks from the attempt to burn it. I agree that there was a lot more death and violence in the event, than one would be led to believe, but back then secrets were kept and certain things were kept buried."
2,"Low quality, soft and brittle Chinese steel.","The Cninese steel is soft, and bends easily. After the nail is bent, the head pulls off in attempts to remove the nail, even in Smartside and OSB, with very little stud hanging on to it. Somebody in China cut some corners on the metallurgy. I end up cutting the nail off short and pounding it the rest of the way in."
3,good but a disappointing finish to the triology,"I was really looking forward to this book as I LOVED Wayfarers - which I highly recommend. The road leads on, however, was too long, aimless and had nothing new to say about Capitalism that Wayfarers hadn't already said and didn't tell us anything new about August's end - which it needed to. Overall a sad end to a great trilogy"
1,These Are NOT The Pliers You're Looking For!,"I purchased this tool with the intent of using it as purposed--to gently tighten a threaded part without scratching it. While the pliers' design is a great idea, the engineering is pathetic. The rubber jaw-covers do not fit properly over the jaws, which leaves the tips unsupported. This caused the rubber to desintegrate with the very first squeeze. Attempts to get the rubber better positioned only caused it to tear. After their very first use, I was on to the replacement covers that were included. Even though I tried to be more careful the second time around, they immediately self-destructed on use. Wrapping them up in electrical tape is helping to hold them together, but I don't anticipate getting even 1% of the work-life I originally expected from this tool. Fortunately, I was only burned for around $20.00. If you're thinking of buying this tool, don't. Keep searching. And, please let us know if you find something that works!"
2,Looks cheap,"I bought this for the soft jaws which I installed on my professional Solder Seal pliers. These pliers look like ""China's worst""... the kind you buy for $2 at a flea market. They are not professional grade."
3,"Not great, not horrible","These were fairly cheap compared to other options. My expectations were not very high and I was not disappointed, nor was I surprised. They are stiff to change grooves and the teeth covers are soft. I can already see the grooves biting through. These won't serve their purpose for much longer...extra covers or not. I think I got exactly what I paid for...a cheap pair of pliers."
2,poor deal,"This is just a CHEAP (die-cast grooves, not machined = rough movement)set of pliers and (2) pair of poor fitting pads. A much better choice would be to get ****10-PC PLIERS COVERS SET from amazon & apply to your own (probably higher quality) pliers. I would return but it is tolerable only because of the price & low usage. Will be using for rather delicate work so I assume the rubber covers will hold up - if not I will update."
1,Very poor quality product,"I could not believe how poorly made this productor is. The attachment holes on the heater body do not align up to those on the legs, furthermore, when the bolts were tightened, the nuts fell off from the retaining clips to prevent them from spinning, making the legs useless. The fit and finish of metal work is so poor the heater looks like a bad lemon car made in the 1980s. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Looks like Cameco has been making and selling junks over the years."
5,Wave Heater,The product works great and the nice part it's so quiet. This is the second one I own and never had problems. I recommend this to campers who are going above 7000 feet because the heater buddy doesn't work at that elevation.
4,Good product,It works just as they said it would and it was very easy to install and it really provides great heat
2,dissapointing,"in the late 90s a friend gave me a used wave 8, which turned out to be the best heater ever [reliable, low fuel consumption] working very well for my needs in snow country. it uses no power, so is great for off the grid living. however my new in the box wave 3 turned out to be more like a ""cheap copy"" of the wave 8. it warms up to operating temp to slow and flames until then. it even set the plastic knob ablaze. once running it heats well. are the new ones made in some 3rd world country?update:the more I use this heater the worse it gets. it consumes fuel at several times the rate of my old wave8 while making much less heat Camco has managed to ruin a very good product line purchased by them from Olympic. I hope to get this defective unit replaced under warranty, be cause it set in the box months before the weather pressed me to bust it out."
2,Disappointing Quality Control,The heater arrived with a non-functioning lighter. This was to say the least disappointing and annoying. A replacement just arrived an installation instructions are supposed to be included - we'll see. It appears a fair amount of dismantling will be required to replace the lighter. This is not good for a $200+ brand new heater. The technician was quick to mail me a new part but made no offer to repair the heater and/or cover the shipping costs. I'd think twice before I purchased a similar product.
5,Wave 3 heater in truck camper,I bought this off Amazon because it was the cheapest price and offered free shipping. I had it in 2 days. It came packaged very well and in great shape. I have it installed in my truck camper and it works very well. Starts right up and puts off alot of heat. Cant wait to really try it out once it gets colder. Would like to see them offer this unit with an accesory kit that would provide you with a piece of flexible hose and several connections. You only get the heater. Any connections or fittings have to be bought separately. Its still a nice unit and Ive heard from others that use them in their RV's that they really perform well.
1,Olympian RV Heater,"Our friends have this heater and they love it. We didn't. It is hard to get lit. Did not heat our RV. We were told our RV is too big for it. We have a 40ft. After we had it for 1 week, it wouldn't stay lit. Told by manufacturer that it was the control knob. They were going to send us a new one. We never received it. Not sure they ever sent it. Once the MH is warm it will keep it warm but it takes forever if you start with it cold. Even though we have the overhead vent cracked and a side window cracked, if the heater is run on high for very long it sets off our co detectors. We are returning it. My husband gave it a 1, I would probably give it a 2. It didn't work for us but it might work for someone else."
2,Not what is advertised,"I have just purchaded the Olympian RV Wave 3 Gas Catalytic Heater. I had a terrible time getting the correct hose and connections. After I finally got it going I find that it does not eluminate with heat. Part of the front does not get red hot even on high. I am going to return the unit as not satifactory. It does light quickly and does heat, but does not heat the entire front of coach - 40ft. I will ask for a replacement or money back."
1,Worthless for brewing coffee in any form,"I owned three of these in a row, and the sad truth is that they simply cannot stand up to the temperatures associated with near boiling water (coffee should be brewed at about 205 degrees F.). One cracked while pouring the water in (No, I didn't pre-warm it, as that is something my Bodum press has never required), the second and third cracked when the coffee was poured out. The glass cannot withstand the rapid temperature changes. Please get a Bodum, you'll get more than one use out of it."
1,Avoid...choose another...no question!,"It didn't crack until i set it out to dry, on the initial cleaning. Hmmm, how long could that be?? Can't believe these guys are allowed to make this and not be arrested. Those folks who had nice things to say will be changing their tune very soon, in my opinion. Unless they brew tepid coffee :( I am careful with my coffee presses...this is JUNK."
2,It doesn't make 3 cups!,"I got this as a gift, and it's a nice idea, but it can't fit 3 cups of coffee in it. My mamma says 1 cup of coffee is 6 oz, not 8 oz as I thought, but it still only holds 12 oz. It makes enough for my morning mug of tea or coffee, but that's it.Other than size issues, it has worked fairly well for me for the 4 times I've used it. I place my tea leaves or coffee into the press first. Then I boil water in a pyrex measuring cup in the microwave and then pour it into the press while it's still boiling. It hasn't cracked yet as the other reviewer suggested it might. The press itself works pretty well in that it prevents even superfine ground coffee from getting into my cup. It comes with a dinky little coaster too.I'm going to try to return this one and get a bigger one, and maybe check out the Bodum brand suggested by the other reviewer."
2,this thing is cute but small,"the product shipped promptly. but honestly 3 cups maybe if yr a hobbit, but holds about 1.5 normal cups"
4,Yet another toaster.,"Toasters seem to last a year or two. Bought this one because it had simple settings, including bagels. So far, for two months, its working ok but I'm not betting my last dollar on it lasting any longer than several others."
5,"For something totally different, check it out","What a great mix of Trip Hop and Film clips. I played a few tracks off this album at a club last week, and the place never new what hit them. Very relaxed and chilled out, but certains parts really let loose and show that this compilation means business. If you dig Loungy grooves mixes with some wacky french phrases, u will surely love this album"
4,Great for starting seeds,"I do use them for starting seeds indoors and they work well. The one thing I don't like is the mesh. It's supposed to decompose but years later, some still show up. I found a solution, as soon as the roots of the little plant start to show I take off the mesh (carefully). When the plants are ready to plant outside I never have a problem getting the peat to stay together. As to the person complaining about the price, I agree. Walmart now has the small size in 36 count boxes for a lot less per pellet and that's without the shipping. Bulk prices should reflect the fact that you are buying in bulk."
2,200 Jiffy 7 Pellets Seed Plugs - Hirt's Gardens,"I think these pellet seed plugs are great. The major problem I have with this company so far is that I only receive 1/2 of the said amount. Had to call the company to let them know that I only received 100 pellets instead of the original amount of 200. If you order from this company - count your pellets. Even the paper sack they shipped to me had 100 written on it. I ordered on Jan 13, 2012 - it's now Jan 26...have yet to receive the other 100 pellets. Hope to receive them soon."
3,Hard,"My first try at growing from home I used these. After sprouting, the roots had difficulties with the peat. I prefer soil now because the expanding peat didn't always do what it was supposed to....."
3,Jiffy 7 Peat Pellets - oversized,"I bought my Jiffy 7 Seed Starter system this spring and had been buying replacement peat pellets for it locally, but wanted a larger quantity. I ordered this package of 200. The bag that arrived says Jiffy 7 on the label but the pellets are 1/4"" too large in diameter to fit into the grippers in the tray. Need them now; no time to exchange, so I'll make them work but I am disappointed.On the plus side, when these pellets expand they form a hole down the middle ready to receive seed, the smaller ones did not; I had to poke holes in them. This is a significant time saver.200 Count- Jiffy 7 Peat Soil Pellets Seeds Starting Plugs: Indoor Seed Starter- Start Planting Indoors for Transplanting to Garden or Planter Pot"
3,Ummmm.,"The single is just ""ok"", but the full length album royally sucks. This is probably about as good as anything Wumpscut did during his Evoke era. Don't bother with Evoke though...there are so many other albums by Wumpscut that are much better."
1,yuck,"I hate this movie. I saw it only once, several years ago, but parts of it are burned in my brain for all time. Someone I dated popped it in the VCR, telling me it was his favorite movie - yikes!I understand that it is a cleverly made and conceived film - all the creatures and things in ""Wonderland"" can be found in Grandpa's (?) house/lab/study, so it can all be Alice's dream or imagination. But if so, what a disturbed child she is! The whole story plays out so creepily and unpleasantly, and it goes on and on. The taxidermised white rabbit alone is enough to give me nightmares, and I'm a grown-up. From the start, when he is prying his tacked down feet off his mounting, through the movie, leaking sawdust from his poorly-stitched seams... Eww.It is a freaky and surreal movie, and I know there are people who love it, but never again for me."
4,Visuals over story,"It's definitely an interesting, albeit rather creepy take on the old story. It's not as funny as one would expect, being quite a bit darker in themes and design overall. It hit me pretty close to home, considering my own dreams and nightmares often look similar to this film.The stop-motion animation is truly a sight to behold, very bold and interesting.The story itself is backseat, as there's very little talking or explanation of what's going on. This film will no doubt enchant younger viewers with its creepy imagery, amuse older audiences and artsy-fartsy types, but it's definitely not for everyone and some kids could very well be scared by the creatures in this movie. Most of them are made of animal skeletons, taxidermied creatures and other such dead things and some may find it upsetting.However, if you're like me, it'll be right up your alley and a welcome addition to any movie library."
2,creepy,"how do you ruin ""alice in wonderland?"" elminate the dialogue. And that's pretty much what's happened here. When there is dialogue, we're forced to watch alice's mouth tell us ""said the white rabbit"" (or whoever) after nearly every line. I have never been so bored with ""alice in wonderland"" nor have i ever been so turned off to something that looked so much like a horror film. Don't waste your time if you're a fan of the wit and fun and knowing humor of the original story."
5,Probably Svankmajer's best movie,"If you are unfamiliar with Svankmajer, it may be best to start with Alice. It is his most stylish and least morbid and grotesque long feature.Sounds appealing? Actually it is a masterpiece. Like his other movies it is not for everyone, but it promises a unique movie experience."
3,Both wonderful and annoying at the same time,"Mostly told through stop-motion animation, this film both amuses me and annoys me at the same time. The animation is excellent, and has a dark and twisted look to it. However, the narration and the constant close-ups on Alice's lips as she speaks detract from the film."
5,Down a darker rabbit hole,"Here's a surreal version of Alice in Wonderland that's both unsettling & compelling, a marvel of Eastern European stop-motion animation & sensibiity. The juxtapostion of Alice's innocence (or apparent innocence, at any rate) & the nightmarish rendition of Wonderland as something more like the underworld, the land of the dead & the disturbed, is one long frisson of darkened delight. It indeed has the quality of a sustained dream, and I've no doubt that the original Surrealists would have found themselves very much at home in it. Not for everyone, of course, but likely to appeal to a much larger audience that one might initially imagine.Highly recommended!"
3,If Carroll's words were images,"Any Alice adaptation needs to have a little whimsy, but this version takes it to the extreme. Most of the scenes from the Wonderland book are here, but Carroll's wordplay is given short shrift. The focus here is clearly on taking the nonsensical themes of Alice and giving them visual form. There are some stunning visuals here but there are also moments where the action drags to a huge degree without enough structure for the viewer to grasp onto.If you're a surrealist, or an Alice fan like me, you have to see it. If not, Disney awaits."
1,Not what I remembered,"I saw this twenty years ago while I was in college, remembering that I liked it. Maybe because my girlfriend was artsy and I was ""in love"". Picked this up again and I don't know what I was thinking. This movie is unwatchable now. I could only take the closeup of Alice's mouth saying ""Said the white rabbit"" so much. That is pretty much the whole dialogue of the movie. Stop animation I remembered does not hold up today. Enough about this, I'm going to watch the SyFy of Alice on blu-ray and can't wait for Tim Burton's adaptation of Alice in Wonderland."
2,Tastes awful!,"I bought this, not realizing it had ginsing, etc. in it. I previously had the Royal Jelly in Honey only and that was fine, but this one tastes terrible. Yuck."
2,Great product! Lousy Price!,"Amazon should be ashamed for selling this excellent product for such an outrageous price. I assumed I was ordering a dozen, but instead received a single, lonely ball in a huge box.Pros: No complaints about the quality of the product.Cons: $37 for one ball?????? I returned the ONE BALL and bought one dozen from another vendor for $35."
1,way over prices,"For this price, I was expecting a box of balls. The box came and it was large enough for a dozen balls. I was quit suprised to find one ball for $30."
2,"Nice softballs for training, but overpriced",I paid $37 for a dozen JUGS sting-free dimpled softballs. You can purchase a no-brand similar softball via softball.com for $10 cheaper. Go to softball.com for all of your softball equipment needs.
4,Good product,"The balls work very well in the pitching machine, so are a good product. My reason for the 4 star rather than 5 star is how much these balls cost in general - these are comparable in price to other balls, but I remain surprised about the overall cost of this type of equipment."
4,Solid Product,"I purchased this product to cut 3/8 and 1/2 inch rebar which is not really the intended use, but it works. One cut was at an angle and chipped a little off the blade, but they still work fine after a 100 cuts or so."
3,Encyclopedia Brown and the Case of the Jumping Frogs,"Boy detective, Encyclopedia Brown returns as a parody of himself. What can you expect from a boy who's been 10 for 30 years? The stories (cases) takes place in a parallel time not the past and not the present. It's a time where kids have names like Herb, Rupert, and Wilford and a foil named Bugs Meany. You can still hire a boy detective for 25 cents a day and preteens say things like, ""stop beating your gums,"" and ""keen for the green."" There is something appealing about heroes being called ""goody goods,"" by their foes and being told to, ""go adopt an egg."" It's good innocent fun. As for the mysteries, they are as clever and incomprehensible as the earlier books in the series--many will try, but few will figure them out. Solutions are in the back of the book."
4,This is great resource for traveling but I did find that not all is updated,"I learned so much from this book about travel and prepared myself well for my 11 country destination to Europe, like having two debit cards in case one gets eaten by the teller machine and it had allot of advice on travel. The only thing about it was that the info about the cost of passports was incorrect and not updated. Maybe an oversight but it still has allot of useful information for novice or expert alike."
5,Biscuit Goes to School,I love the pictures. Our kindergartener is learning to read and will love this book that she can read herself. Can't wait to sit with her while she reads to us.
5,Great easy reader,My sister sent my son one easy reader Biscuit book for my son and he loved it. I bought this one and several others for him to read. He really loves his Biscut books!
3,It was ok,My cousin bought this book for my seven year old. It's cute but maybe for a preschooler or kinder. It was ok
2,Should be a Blog.,I have traveled far and wide so perhaps I shouldn't have bought this book. If you haven't traveled this will give you good direction but I would have liked to scan it at a book store to know it was a waste of my time.
4,The Cause for Wanderlust,"Tim makes an engaging case on why you should sell everything and explore the world. Traveling through parts of the world can be cheaper than living in America and this book explains what to expect, how much to spend and how to get around."
5,Great starting point!!,"This is a great book for putting together a cheap, fun, and exciting vacation to a far away place! It gives you the basic details about each country so that you can figure out if the country is right for you. This is NOT a comprehensive guide. It does not go into too much detail but it gives you a feeling for what you can expect when traveling to the different places. I have already shared this book with all of my family and friends.The author has a wealth of knowledge and an immense amount of experience with world travel. He also has a great sense of humor and keeps the book fun to read.The only problem I find with this book is that every time I read a chapter, I am overwhelmed with wanderlust!!"
5,A Solid Basis for Starting Your Practice,"It is one thing to learn how to mediate, it is another to learn how to start your business as a mediator. This book focuses on the second task. I found that this book contains good, practical advice for analyzing your own abilities as a mediator and setting up your practice. It even talks about how to establish the physical environment of your office. Combine this with Allan H. Goodman's new, second edition of Basic Skills for the New Mediator, and you should be ready to hang out your shingle."
4,Good book,"This was a great book. I couldn't put it down. Although, if you are looking for a book to tell you about how to be a mediator, this is not the one. This one just does an awesome job at guiding you through the choices of Mediation as a career.If you want a book that actually goes through the intimate steps of mediation and strategies specific to performing the family mediation process itself, you should take a look at ""The Fundamentals of Family Mediation"" by John M. Haynes. It actually walks you through intake and strategies to conducting the actual sessions themselves.Anyway, this book was great from the business standpoint. Very straight forward as far as how to try to build and maintain a successful mediation career/business.Good read ;0)J"
5,Mediation Career Guide,This book was very helpful. The format is easy to follow and there are check list and survey to help you get more information about mediation from possible clients. I had alot of questions about how to get started building a mediation practice and this book answered those questions. Mosten introduces the reader to mediation and the personal qualifications meeded to be successful. He supplies information that will help the reader gain more knowledge in mediation through education and training. He covers how to build your career by creating a signature and set up your office. He also covers preparing a business plan which is helpful in building your business and giving it direction and purpose. I would and have reccommended this book to others in and out of the mediation field.
4,Nice Book,This is not the be all and end all book for an aspiring nature photographer but it is nicely written and has useful information.
2,"ODlL 14""tubular skylight",This product is very flimsy and the tape does not hold well. I would not recommend this product. When trying to rotate the tubes they came apart. This apparently happens a lot. Buyer beware.
5,review,Product came with all essential items to install. I recommend installing when doing your roof replacement. Interior lens look just like pot lights and perform just as good.
1,Brad P,"The installation wasn't bad, its all pretty straight forward. However the amount of light they claim you get is misleading. After installing it I was disappointed with the amount of light it lets in, definitely not as advertised. i would recommend looking onto a different brand and not wasting your money on ODL."
3,Installation,"Not as easy to install as stated. In a strait run they would be fine. When the installation involved slight angles expect to get frustrated. The joints are flimsy and disconnect very, very easy.There design needs work.A ball bearing system would help. What was described as a two install ended up being 6hrs. I consider myself to be very handy around the house so skill level was not a factor."
1,DONT BUY!!!!****!!!!,"The light it provides is not worth all the work, time and money to put this in. Contacted ODL and they sent a ""clear"" lens that was suppose to help let more light in ... it was the same lens as was in the kit but just dome shaped. ODL sent it to me for free but they should as their product isnt good and the ""clear"" dome was useless. My husband took the skytube back out, repaired our roof and ceiling and put the ceiling light back in we had been using.Do yourself a favor and just buy a high wattage fluorescent ""white"" bulb/bulbs for your existing light fixtures. We have wasted approx. 2 days of work and aggravation on this skytube and hope in writing this we can help someone else avoid this.Note - we did not buy this from Amazon but wanted to make Amazon buyers aware as wefrequently buy from Amazon ourselves."
2,Solatube is a a much better value,"These ODL products are fine if you just want something serviceable. The light output is MUCH lower than the Solatube, 20-60% lower. The Solatube tube dome also gives an hour or two per day of extra usable light. The Solatube product is just better built, sturdier. Important if you are putting a hole in your roof. Great idea but spend the extra money and get a Solatube. More expensive but a much better value."
5,Indispensable resource for Dead fans!,"Anybody who enjoys live recordings in general and especially those of the Grateful Dead should run, not walk to order this book. ""Jam"" packed with crucial information about specific shows as well as the history of making the tapes, this is truly without parallel in the history of publishing. Talk about your ""hours of amusement""!"
1,DONT USE,I INSTALLED AS DIRECTED ON MY BOAT A/C AND IT WAS WORKING OK UNTILL I WENT BACK THE NEXT WEEKEND TURN THE A/C ON AND IT KICKED MY BREAKER AFTER CHECKING THIS OUT I FOUND THAT MY COMPRESURE WAS LOCKED UP.
1,poorly thoought out,"fitting provided does not fit the low side of r 12 system and yet is advertised to be both for r 22 and r 12 as a result I was never able to get it into the system to see if it would work, i would recommend that people spend their money on red angle products and not the can but bottle and buy the separate injector, gimmick are generally fraught with problens"
1,not pleased,did not work. a little expensive for a product that says it stops leaks in all the places fo the system but didnt
2,A/C sealer,"Apparently it did work, but the container was nearly empty when I got it! It was kinda expensive and a disappointment to have a nearly empty can, but what can I do?"
2,PurpleTeacher,"This book was a little disappointing. I purchased it because my students were learning about Spring. I found that some other Spring-themed books, especially those by Lois Ehlert, were much better. This book did not keep my students' attention and, while the rhyming is cute, it makes very little sense for young children."
5,Lets get these books reprinted,"It appears that a lot of us have been searching for these books in every second hand bookstore and public library we can find. Maybe it is the celtic mysticism, maybe the characters. Whatever it is there is something about the way these books are written that you actually can identify with them. So please can we get them reprinted, even a small run, so people like me can stop searching. For 10 years it is the first book that I search for in every library catalogue and bookstore. I am getting old!"
5,Have emailed the publisher,"Hi,Re-read this book again the other day on the basis of of all the emails I was getting from people asking for my copy of the book! It's as interesting and disturbing as it ever was. On top of that, I have emailed Ms Berry's publisher to see if we can find out if the book is ever being re-released."
5,A fantastic sequel as sequels go!,"A beautiful follow-up to Easy Connections. After finding out that the two were originally intended to be one book, I can see why this fits in so well. It's a fascinating look at the concepts of love and freedom as well as the seemingly impossible ability of Cathy to forgive the most horrible of deeds in order to live the life she has been so unfairly forced into. I love this book possibly just as much as I loved its predecessor."
4,"Liz, give us a 3rd book!","I read Easy Connections back in high school and was hooked on finding the sequel. Thanks to the previous reviewers I finally finished Easy Freedom and was satisfied and addicted to Liz Berry's story. Overall good story focusing on Cathy overcoming her trauma and moving on. I wish Berry focused more on Cathy having some at least more comfortable moments with Dev or even Chris, like in the first book."
5,Lets get these books reprinted,"It appears that a lot of us have been searching for these books in every second hand bookstore and public library we can find. Maybe it is the celtic mysticism, maybe the characters. Whatever it is there is something about the way these books are written thatt you actually can identify with them. So please can we get them reprinted, even a small run so people like me can stop searching. For 10 years it is the first book that I search for in every library catalogue. I am getting old!"
5,The coolest book on Black + White yet,"The reader is the beneficiary of this smart, deep collection of obsessive compulsive creators. I loved the witty writing and the deep well of art and commentary. I've given this book out as a gift to my clients as a way of opening their eyes and really seeing true design integrity. After looking at the world in black and white, color somehow seems like a cheap gimmick."
4,TOWN MADNESS,"People from OAKLAND CALI, (anywhere for that matter) really slept on this album. Lil Ke Mad Maxx spit FIRE. "" My Life""hWHOOOOAA....they got billy Bathgate (Steady Mobbn) that man always brings heat. "" Best "" thats the Karate Kidd beat. Man It is not to late to pick up this album. DO it"
1,Poor Choice,I bought this CD and another by Dwayne Burnside based on the reviews I read about it. They were wrong! The reviews said that Dwayne was a good but not great singer. They also said he was an excellent guitar player.He cannot sing at all and he is only a minimally good player. I wasted my money on this CD.
3,Scrambled Eggs and Root Beer,"This album is an excellent display of the unforgetable guitar prowess and sweet vocal tones of Duwayne Burnside. I am not sure, however, that this album was very well thought-out. It sounds thrown together. The guitar is rambling at 180 mph while Duwayne is singing slow and down low on Gotta' Pretty Woman. THe drums track sounds like it was put down in another state, aside from lacking dynamics. The bass playing (Gary, is that you?) is excellent, and perhaps the most tastefully done part of the album. But this album is a clearly a slopped-together excuse to exhibit Duwayne's talent. Sloppin' together worked for the Sound Machine because . . . I don't know why. It just worked with R.L.'s style. But it doesn't work for the Texas style. Next time Duwayne listens to Albert King, he should listen to the band and the mix--like on Live Wire/Blues Power. They get that right, then they're right."
5,Documentary,"There are a few clips from films in this, but it is mostly interviews with some of the most interesting people in the Horror Film Genre (George Romero, Cassandra Peterson [Elvira - Mistress of the Dark], Robert Englund [Freddy Kreuger]). Ms Peterson is even funnier in a live Q&A than she is on her 'Midnight Madness' movie shows. Someone actually asked 'the' dumb question: ""How'd you get your start?"" and she gave the best answer I've ever heard: ""My Dad was horny and he jumped my mom - jeese!"" Funny lady..."
1,It Broke after 3 days!,Yeah I was kinda upset. I bought this ring for my roomate for Christmas and it Broke after the 3rd day. We lost the jewel and everything because it just fell out.
3,Lost jewel in two rings from this vendor,"I loved this ring so much but one of the marcasites is gone for good. That's so upsetting to me. While the price is outstanding, if the quality isn't up to snuff, it kind of doesn't matter. I had the same experience with losing a jewel from this company's eternity band. That jewel I found and was able to glue back in."
2,Char-Broil 65-Inch Artisan Grill Cover,"I was disappointed with the cover, after one week of owning the product, I noticed the cover was starting to separate from the seams. And in the packaging there was no mentioning of a warranty period or a guarantee."
5,Hard to see how this could get less than 5 stars...,"Not sure what people are looking for in a cover. Complaining about where the product is manufactured? The color is a shade off? Is that a reason to give a bad review?This is a nice grill cover. In fact, in a store, I have yet to see a nicer one. Color-wise, looks OK to me and I'm a graphic Artist. I got the blue one, and it's blue. What more could you ask for? People are ridiculous."
4,Grill cover fits like a glove,"This cover is a good fit for my grill, providing maximum coverage. During recent rains and high winds, it stayed in place without requiring additional tiedowns. It appears to be heavy duty enough to last a long time."
5,its nice,I like it but I wish it was longer to cover the wheels properly and avoid it from getting damaged from snow & rain.
2,"Looks nice, but no strap to hold it down","It looks nice and the cover seems thick and well built.2 things I didn't like:- It has a carcinogen warning on it. Why would you have that for a product that goes on something we cook food on- It has a design flaw - no strap to hold it down when it gets windySo, but it if you want to, but you won't be completely satisfied."
3,Short,"Unlike other reviews, mine came in the color as shown in the description. Overall, it is fine, however, it is really short. The bottom hangs about a foot off the ground. So, this works fine as long as you are not looking to protect the bottom."
5,Great deal,"This product looks just like the picture (although some reviews said it was more brown). Great quality. Doesnt have a drawstring at the bottom or velcro like some, but it fairly heavy so stays down. Another reviewer mentioned putting fishing weights at the bottom which we will do if it becomes an issue. Overall great product for the price."
1,Don't get this item!!!,Within one month the outside lost color and looked faded and very very old. Don't get this product!!! It was sitting outside in the sun with nothing bad going on. I got two and both look faded and very bad.
5,Best Grill Cover I've Ever Owned,"This is by far, the best grill cover I've ever owned. It's made of nice, heavy nylon and is attractive - other vinyl covers eventually rip and get torn apart, but this one is excellent. I wish it had some way to cinch-up at the bottom. Like most grill covers, it can be lifted up off the grill on very windy days.Update 7/28/2012 - I've owned this grill cover for a few years now, and it is still going strong. The colors have faded from sun and weather exposure, but it still protects my grill very well. It's so much more durable than any vinyl cover I've owned."
4,"Nice Quality & Durability, But Color is Misrepresented","I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota, where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather. The cover has held up wonderfully. The only word of caution is on the color. It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels. They may be green when you first buy the cover, but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill. To me, this is a minor drawback, but others might find it more objectionable."
4,Hubby loved it!,"This grill cover is very well made, and not cheap plastic like the majority of them. For $19.99, I though this was a steal (hubby had paid twice as much for one at our local Lowe's). I would have given it 5 stars if the cover had come down as far on our grill as it does on the one in the picture. Our grill is not a 65"", and is not overly tall, but the cover is a tad short. Other than that, we're both happy with it, and am glad I found it on here for less $$$."
5,Char-Broil 2185564 65-Inch Cover,"The Char-Broil 2185564 65-Inch BBQ cover is really a nice one. It's big enough to cover well, and it also looks nice."
5,Thick waterproof cover,"Covers our grill completely. Kept the grill dry during a heavy rain. The attractive earth tones fabric is not brittle. There are no tie downs, but we have secured with long bungee cords."
3,Looks good but too wide and too short,"I purchased this after reading the rave reviews from other owners. Although the material and the olive green color were very high quality, the size didn't work. The piping around the edges doesn't sit right if you have a 61"" grill like we do -- looked silly. Was also disappointed in the length -- left about 8"" exposed at the bottom and we need the coverage for our rainy climate. Lastly, for the price, I'd think they'd include some type of drawstring or something at the bottom to keep it just from flapping in the breeze. Had to return it. Good idea if your grill is closer to 65"" in width and unexposed coverage at the bottom doesn't bother you."
2,Noticeably Faded within 1 month,"The cover itself is durable and somewhat attractive. I really liked the hunter green color when it first arrived. Although it has only been just over 1 month since we received it, and the green has faded quite considerably. I would not buy this product again."
5,Char Broil 65inch Artisan Grill Cover,"I can highly recommend this product. I am really pleased with the quality and perfect fit. It is also very attractive and the color shades are even better than in the picture. It was a great find, a great buy, and unbelievable value. I highly recommend it.Update November 2009: Still going strong. Still love it!!!"
3,It's NOT green,"Although I have only had this cover for about 2 weeks, the quality of the cover is excellent. It seems very durable and well made. The only problem is that it is not green. Its a tan or MAYBE a Kahki. If you care about that sort of thing and you want a hunter green cover to (ie., match your outdoor funiture like I did) than do not buy it. If you just want a good cover, than I think you are in good shape with this one."
1,It's not really green!,"The reason I rate this grill cover with 1 star is because the picture -- and the grill cover's box -- advertise that the grill cover is mountain green when in fact it is brown.It also had blemishes all over the front of it, little dots of dye or something.It looks like a good quality grill cover, but it does NOT look like the grill cover I ordered, which was green and would have matched the rest of my patio furniture (also green). I kept it anyway because the item description at Amazon does not actually promise that it's green (the box does, and the product photo does) and I just need to keep the bird poop and rain off my new grill.Buyer beware!"
3,beware of wind,the cover is made of durable material but the problem is that if it is windy it will completly blow off of grill because it is a little short and does not have strings or velcro straps to keep it tight on the sides.i have had it about 1 month and it has blown off 3 times.the other days when its not windy it is a good cover.i also think it is a good looking cover and has a reasonable price.
4,well made,"Well made and does the job. Unfortunately it doesn't reach all the way to the ground and doesn't have tie-downs, but other than that it works great."
4,cobertor para el BBQ GRILL,"Es un buen producto, lo recomiendo, es de buena calidad y cubre bien el grill. Creo que el precio que pague es suficiente."
1,looked good but did not fit,"According to the dimensions, this cover should have fit but it was a little too small. We sent it back and had one custom made."
2,Fades over time,Price is good but do not expect it to maintain the color. I had this cover for 3 years and it is ready to be replaced.
3,Grtill Cover,"Good quality, nice and heavy. Does not have a strap to gather the lower sides under shelves, keeps blowing off grill."
5,Great product - Fits perfectly,I looked for a replacement cover for my grill at one of the large home improvement warehouses and found one at twice the price as this one purchased here. This is a great buy and I am please with the purchase.
5,Perfect mix of stiff bristles (not too stiff) and less stiff bristles,"I had to buy six of these, but it was the only way to get them. I love this brush! Other brushes are too stiff - so I can't use on delicate glassware. This is the best of all worlds."
3,Good enough to enjoy.,"The Secret of Life is another delightful and bizarre ready by Rudy Rucker. This time we enter the world of the '60s, and the life of an alien, Conrad, sent by his own to live the life of a normal human being while exploring for them the meaning of life for humans. (Of course, Conrad doesn't know his true identity as a human body is fashioned for him and he is woven into the life of a Louisville family, altering their memories to include this second son.)Will it be drugs, existentialism, love or simply the pursuit of meaning itself? Will Conrad want to remain a human once he realizes his true identity?With a bit of exploration of alienated '60s youth and teen to young-adult life, you come to care enough about Conrad and his struggles to keep reading.I say: worth it."
3,Juvenalia,"Surpassed by every other Rucker book I've read, I can only imagine this being enjoyed by someone who hasn't had their expectations set high by better works - perhaps an adolescent not yet assigned to read 'Stranger in a Strange Land' and 'The Catcher in the Rye' would find in this book something novel."
4,Wolverine vs Sabretooth,"Everything was sent on time and the item arrived before Christmas. I realized after the fact that I spent too much on this, but it's for my son and he loves the toy. Of course, Sabertooth's arm fell off when we took him out of the package. Luckily, it snaps back on. If it's a collector edition, then too bad for other colloectors. My son loves playing with both toys."
4,start a discussion,"This innocous item, also easy to buy here in France makes me want to start a discussion with others about the availability of dual voltage appliances. I have seen the assertion that most appliances will run on either voltage............can you say ""smoke test""I know that my lap top and appnia breathing machine do indeed swing both ways. The HP printer bought here, not so much.if somebody would suggest a way/place to post and form a relivant group.if Amazon would carry a nice rugged 220-110 converter of 1500 watts capacity (they have become rather cheap)if collective wisdom could identify things like can openers or cuisine arts that may be dual voltage with some manufacturerWell I shall be checking back to repost or join the group"
1,Blades are too weak,"Main blades are wooden and they don`t last too much. scratch easily.Main blades should be the plastic ones, which are a lot more resistant."
2,"Somewhat entertaining, but little substance","This book presents the screenplay for the recent television movie ""After the Storm"" and the six-page Ernest Hemingway short story on which it was loosely based. The adapter A. E. Hochner also throws in an informative essay on the art of adapting. While this will certainly interest would-be playwrights and Hemingway afficionados, there is little else of substance here.The short story is little more than a premise--a poor Bahamian fisherman finds a sunken luxury yacht and tries unsuccessfully to scavenge it-with no supporting characters and an unsatisfactory resolution. Hochner adds villians, conspiracies, and two love triangles to spice things up. The result is a better-than-average TV movie, due to solid performances by Benjamin Bratt and Armand Assante, but it is still too slow and formulaic to meet the standards of a feature film."
5,Excellent Golf Bag,"This is probably the best golf bag out there for this price. The bag has tons of pockets and more than ample space for your golfing supplies. It is really nice looking and rivals more expensive brand-name bags that don't have as many features. The cooler pocket is a decent size, maybe not as big as I had hoped, but fine otherwise. Long story short I highly recommend this bag."
3,Tight Fit,"Despite the adequate number of pockets, they don't hold as much as you would think. They are not ""full"" enough without much ""give"", so items tend to fit too tight against the core. And with a Sun Mountain Speed Cart, the bag does not fit because of the rear location of the putter well.Additionally, there is only one ring to hang anything on (like a towel or a ball pouch)... and that ring is on the very back and not accessible. Also the cooler pocket barely holds a 32 ounce drink; it has to be put in at an angle and is a very tight fit. Good luck with multiple cans of drinks.The 14 full length individual club slots are very good. Also the bag material is very good and strong. Overall, I rate it a ""B-"""
5,These are always voted the best black licorice,I have purchased these several times. They are always raved by everyone as the best black licorice. It's hard for me to find in the stores but Amazon makes it easy.
3,Aussi Licorce made in the USA,"Does not seem as soft or as intense with flavor as the black licorce. However,some guest and friends prefer it over the black.Quite different than the traditional Strawberry---seems to have more of a multi-berry/cherry flavor to it.."
2,Licorice tasted a little stale,"We really liked this licorice when it was sold in the store. It was the same exact brand, but a different container. We ordered some online when the store didn't carry it anymore. It was a little hard, stale and the flavor was off. Didn't taste the same. Seemed a little pricey as well for the product we received."
2,Not as good as the real deal,I had this stuff about 6 years ago and loved it. I guess back then it was the real deal and not manufactured here in the states. Not very happy with this product
4,Lucky Country Black Licorice Recall,"I LOVE this product so when the local COSTCO didn't have any I didn't think anything of it. I went to a local supermarket and they didn't have any either. So I thought I'd try Amazon. I was about to push the order button when I decided to check on see where it was being made. That's when I discovered the product has been recalled for high levels of lead. This recall now extends to California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and Washington State. You can read about it on ""Food Safety News"", ""Buy Wise"" and others. Ironically the website for Lucky Country doesn't mention it-I wonder why?"
4,"Good, but not as good as the last time....","My order arrived on time. I bought this for friends at work. It was good, as far as taste, but this time the licorice was a bit harder than usual. What always got me about Lucky Country Licorice was the soft texture, but this time I was disappointed that it seemed a bit hard."
4,Good but not great,"It just doesn't have the amount of licorice flavor as the Aussie made product. Or, for that matter, most other quality licorice products. I am still enjoying it, just not as much as I had hoped to."
2,Grape,"I had purchased the Black licorice and thought it to be some of the best I'd ever had, and I do love licorice. Ordered this only because the Black was not available, but found it tastes more like Grape, of which I am not fond."
2,Off-brand badness,"For a licorice addict this will do, but it isn't any better than Twizzlers, and might be worse."
3,"Made in the US version, not the same recipe as Imported from Austrailia version","I thought, wow, bulk Lucky Country Red Licorice, sweet, but alas no, it is a mass produced Americanized version from Lucky Country's new US manufacturing plant. The recipe is completely different from the Lucky Country Red Licorice (same brand, same name) that is Imported from Australia. The original recipe has more real licorice despite being a red licorice, and is much softer. The Made in US version is your typical chewy waxy candy licorice with barely a hint of licorice, just pure sweet. Shame on Lucky Country for taking a high end sophisticated product and watering it down like every licorice sold in every drug store in the US. I'm heading back to Target or Trader Joe's for the real thing."
1,Better in the Bags than in the tubs,"I received Old Country licorice in a gift basket for Valentine's day and fell in love. I ordered it in the 4/ 1 lb. tubs shown here and received it this past week. It is not soft, in fact it is a bit on the tough side. If you are considering making an order, wait for the bags. I do not think that the tubs are airtight."
1,Horribly disappointing,"This stuff has no distinguishable flavor to it, just a stagnant sweetness. It is just terrible. Black cherry, my arse. Yuck! And, these are its good points."
2,Ayahuasca Music: Look Somewhere Else!,"I purchased this CD in Amsterdam back in the Summer of 1999. I was shocked to find that it was basically straight-ahead techno-type dance music spiced up with samples of Shipibo shamans and Don Agustin Rivas. Nothing very original there (if you want to hear good uses of similar samples, try ""Mother Ayahuasca"" on the ""Kiva"" CD by Steve Roach, Michael Stearns and Ron Sunsinger). However, the CD is well-designed, and has a wonderful little booklet about ayahuasca in English and Dutch (?). If you're curious about traditional, contemporary or ""post-modern"" uses of ayahuasca, whether in South America or Europe, the booklet serves as a good introduction. If you want to hear insipid techno with pilfered sound samples, this is also good. However, if you want to hear ""the real thing,"" I suggest you fly down to South America (or New Mexico), drink the brew and listen."
5,Trying to determine total price.,"I went through 7 screens to get the shipping charge in order to compare with Koeze's web price and shipping for exact item. Same exact price and shipping charge as ordering the Colossal Cashews directly from Koeze's. No Deal Here, sorry.(Amazon people: we are ordering here to save time and money. I can drive to Grand Rapids, MI for the nuts. Please be honest.)"
5,koeze cashews,"These are the best of the best! The nuts are big, mature, sweet, and salty. I will only buy these nuts from now on. Dellivery was just a few days long."
2,Colossal Size but Average Taste.,"Here's the lone dissenter. Don't get fooled by the unanimous praise. These cashews are average, nothing exceptional, only the canister impressed me. Just to expensive when you can get the same quality for a fraction of the price, albeit without the nice glass decanter."
4,Great book!,The book offers great answers to difficult interview questions even for the experienced person. A must read for anyone looking for work!
5,A Solid Stroy,I enjoyed this book a lot. It really relates the past with the present and links the situations. It is a very interesting book for those who enjoy reading about time travelling and love to experience new things all the time.
