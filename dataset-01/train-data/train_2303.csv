5,"Shake ""Quakes""","Back in'95, when I went to the CD release party for Shake, I saw the best blues trio I'd ever seen. This CD does not have a bad cut on it. If you like electric blues, you need this record in your changer, soon. It rocks!"
5,This is one GREAT cd!,"When these guys hit the stage, they are phenomenal. I keep this cd in the changer at all times. Suhler ignites the guitar with fierce intensity, and Carlton Powell and Paul Hollis round out the trio with a rhythm section that can't be matched. So put on your dancing shoes for the title cut, SHAKE and SNAKE HIPS. Check out the blues standard, LITTLE BOY BLUE. But be sure not to miss the best song of the bunch, EVERY DOG HAS HIS DAY. Every time this one comes on, I want to pull the car over and dance on the side of the road! You gotta check this one out!"
5,Authentic,"There are very few recordings as heartfelt and intimate as Fourth & Beale. It's recorded in 1969 in Furry's home, with apparently only two other people in audience. Listening to him sing and play brings to mind Joni Mitchell's song about Furry, as if you're hearing her inspiration. His emotions are displayed vividly throughout, most especially in ""When The Saints Go Marchin' Home"" where Furry is so choked, obviously signing about his own death, that he can hardly get the words out. This is a little known gem, and a must have for any acoustic blues fan."
3,The Iron Major,"I thought this was a very good telling of Frank Cavanaugh's life at that stage, with some fine acting all round. A little slow, perhaps in places, but that timing is far more important to me than the modern flash/dash directing which doesn't allow me to absorb the details at times. The story was easy to follow, the locations were extremely well photographed, and the quality of the black/white film itself was excellent."
3,Freshwater Macroinvertebrates of NE NA,"This is a semi easy to use identification key. Before using this book, prior knowledge of the subject is required. The key starts in the Order and then works down to the species. I feel that this is a good book but I would suggest having another key as well, that is a more user friendly edition."
3,help,"There has been a terrible error with this item....Paperback: 442 pages ; Dimensions (in inches): 1.25 x 10.25 x 7.00Publisher: Cornell Univ Pr; (February 1990)ISBN: 0801496888I can't be the only person this has happened to! The pages have been misbound and some are missing. At page #114 the book reverts back to page #83--leaving out what should be here. Then atp#114 it jumps to p#147 then ends on427.There are some missing page as well.... Granted, I just realized this, but I had purchased the books well in advance of a study we had proposed. Now I am not sure how to proceed.....Please help. the pages that are there, are very helpful, but it is like living in the movie Groundhog Day when trying to key something out.....Please contact me ASAPGlen Buckner"
5,Outstanding After All These Years,"This text is a classic. I have continued to return to it over the years whenever my students need reference, problem sets and clarity not otherwise obtainable in current texts (I review 25-30 on this topic per year). If returned to print it would surely help to put the subject back on track for our students."
5,"Excellence, Emotion, Etc...","Void Where Prohibited's debut release is one of the feeble music we call rock's last attempt at showing society that rock isn't dead. These guys are keeping it alive every damn day. The Orange Album is kinda like Megadeth meets NOFX at an old whisky bar owned by John Lee Hooker, and Gwar is playing on the tv. So, just at least give it a shot, what have you to lose?"
3,Better as a collaborator,"Thighpaulsandra is perhaps better known to the world as a collaborator with Julian Cope and, more recently, as a full-fledged member of Coil. In both of these environments, his contributions are well-received, leaving a little bit of himself on a larger work. However, his work on his own, while still engaging and interesting to listen to, seems to lack direction and cohesiveness, giving this release a disjointed, unmemorable feel. Still, recommended for fans of Coil's recent stuff (as I am), or for fans of ambient music in general. I'd probably lean more towards 3 1/2 stars, so overall I'm pleased with this disc"
1,BOOOOO!!!,This is the Worst X-box game ever!dont Rent it and if you buy it will be like throwing away your money!
1,Terrible!!!,"I agree with the first reviewer. This is not a read-along because there isn't a book to ""read"" with. Too, the dvd is too long - 60 minutes!!! I was very disappointed."
1,The Incredibles Audio Story Adventure,"My son is also a collector of Disney Read-alongs and he too, was disappointed to discover that there is no book with which to read along. I imagine this same scene was replayed all over the country on this Christmas morning! Thumbs down to Disney on this one!"
2,Massage oils aren't worth it,"Not what we expected. All the ""choices"" of scent, etc. are artificial. Every bottle is pretty much the same, and for us the ""same"" means that every bottle is full of a product we don't like. The self-warming oil gets down-right hot in sensitive areas. When done, you lie there covered in oil and sticking to the sheets. Not my cup of tea."
3,Dok,Its cool to have more than one to play with. Just don't get any of itnear your...goober or vaj jay jay...lol wont make that mistake again lol.
3,look for a better book,"This book was used during my parasitology class and my classmates and I felt it was hard to follow. The information was not presented in a concise manner. The pictures were helpful, though."
3,Volume number?,"What's the volume number of this issue??Sorry to give a middling rating to this, it's probably a 5*."
1,"Great recording? Oh, No!","I should've listened carefully to the two reviewers who gave ONE star to this CD. I bought it mainly for the sound. The sound was horrible: shallow, out of focus, and no ambience. Even the digital cannons didn't supprise me at all. I invited my friend over my home who had the original 1978 Telarc recording and we compared the two recordings: the first one was far better, both in playing and sound. It's like a cheap pizza you buy at a convenience store - lots of shallow toppings but no taste at all. Buy the first one and you won't be disappointed."
1,Would be nice to hear the orchestra...,"But instead of the orchestra, we are treated to the wonderful sound of reverb, along with some very fine compression artifacts when the cannons go off. I was truly disappointed by the sound of this - it is the aural equivalent of mud and cotton, very mushy, hard to make out the details, and not something I really want to deal with. The conducting seems particularly heavy handed, as if the conductor wanted to make a name for himself by making his own slight alterations to the piece that, while not significant, are unnecessary and very irritating. Poor recording technique and a wierd performance, but wait! There's a warning on the label that the cannons are very loud!! Oh my, then this MUST be the recording to get to show off a [amt.] stereo in the bachelor pad - maybe the cannons will be so loud that your date will hop right into your lap!This is to classical music what a primer-grey muscle car is to a show of luxury automobiles."
5,A hard topic to find,"When a close childhood friend of mine died several years ago, I looked far and wide for books about losing a friend, and found that most literature on grief is focused on the death of a spouse or child. Which is understandable, but not the same thing. This book was wonderful and just what I'd been looking for. Blessings."
4,works right,"It works very well, as is advertised. Works much better if you warm it first with hot water."
2,Not as hot as Thermos,"I have a 17oz Stanley and a 16oz Thermos, and I have noticed that the Stanley doesn't keep food as hot. At lunch time I'm eating lukewarm stir fry, which is disconcerting.I poured boiling water (around 212 dF) into the Stanley and two Thermos models, closed them, waited an hour, and then took the temperature of the water with an instant-read digital thermometer. The water inside the two Thermos models was 190 and 180 dF. The water inside the Stanley was 160 dF.The hotter of the two Thermoses was this model:Thermos Stainless King SK3000MB4 Food Jar, Midnight Blue"
1,Defective Bottle; Stanley = No Warranty,"I bought this Stanley food jar in order to bring hot soup to work. As recommended, I conditioned it daily with hot water prior to filling it with soup, but in less than one week it would no longer keep the soup hot longer than one hour. I emailed Stanley regarding their ""Lifetime Warranty"" - I received an automated response stating they would get back with me. I've waited two weeks, still no response. Returning the bottle to Amazon makes no sense considering postage and Amazon's restocking fee. Bottom line: This bottle proved to be junk, and Stanley's ""Lifetime Warranty"" is worthless."
1,broke after several uses,"We loved this item for the first few uses. It kept liquids incredibly hot. However, all of a sudden, after less than 10 uses, it does not work. Since it is not glass inside, we do not know why. We are disappointed."
3,Hot...not hot enough,"Slightly disappointed in this food container. It doesn't keep food hot for the advertised 12 hours. So far I have only tried oatmeal. It cooks it perfectly in the container, but I get about 3 1/2 hours before it becomes cool. It's possible that liquids will fare better, though, my Stanley vacuum bottle peaks at 3 1/2 hours, too. I do follow the instructions for preheating with boiling water, and the container remains cool to the touch which indicates that it is ""working"". But I definitely won't be able to use it to eat hot soup for dinner after work before my night classes. I bought this in order to prepare oatmeal on marathon morning when I have about 3 1/2 hours from when I will make it until when I will eat it, so it will suffice for that need."
5,just bought another,"I bought one of these a couple of months ago and my kids compete to see who gets it in their lunch. I just ordered a second, they take soup for lunch and its hot and yummy. They feel sorry for the kids eating school lunch :-) and theyre eating veggies!"
2,It stopped keeping food hot.,It was working for About a year. This week I did a testing but found out food gets cold after 2 hours. Even water gets cold after 2 hours. It's useless if it cannot keep things hot. I was angry that my kids were eating cold food this whole time I didn't realize. They were too young to complain..
2,Failed after a few years,"This is my second Stanley vacuum container to fail, out of three purchased. My 1 liter bottle still works fine (for now), but a smaller bottle and a .5 liter food jar both failed. I replaced the bottle with a Thermos Nissan bottle. Stanley is sending a replacement for the .5 liter food jar, but I am wary of the many reports of these failing. I probably won't purchase any more Stanley products."
5,well made,"It is the perfect size to carry lunch, and very well made. I love the simplicity of its design."
1,"Pass on this one, unless you like cold soup!","I tested my food jar a couple days ago...I've only had it for 6 months. I put boiling water in it for 10 minutes, dumped it, and immediately filled it with boiling water. 4 hours later, the water was barely warm to the touch. I hope I have better luck with a Thermos brand food jar because this one is going in the trash."
1,Designed to fail,"(1) Leaks. Gets worse rapidly. The gasket material in the lid is prone to grab, wrinkle and abrade instead of form a decent seal with the body.(2) After about a year the insulation failed. It was immediate and dramatic. The whole exterior surface would get warm when hot liquid was added, and the whole thing (inside and out) would be tepid 40 minutes later.(3) Even before the failure the thermal performance was mediocre at best. Hot food/beverage did not stay hot nearly as well as it should.Newer is not better. Find a used thermos from the time period 1970-1990. These were more likely to be manufactured honestly, instead of what we have now: designed for rapid repurchase."
4,Hot lunch!,"I wanted a good hot lunch at work without spending eight to ten dollars. Soup from from home, chili, leftovers. It does the job and is tough enough that I can toss it in the trunk and forget about it.The jar has two flaws. It's heavy and there is no easy way to attach anything like a handle."
2,Hard to thread top and leaks,"I am really sad to report that this product is not build well. YES it may be indestructible however threading the top on (which we likely all do in a hurry) is pretty tough. I did two tests - my last one I took my time to get the threading just right to see if this still leaks. It definitely does, and not by my fault. I wanted to make sure I wasn't making it leak by rushing. Anyhow, I really like the style - and how it feels. However it leaks! I cannot pack this in my bag - it's going to be next to electronics.I am now going to try Thermos brand, which is unfortunate."
1,"I'd like to swear by it, but guess I'll just have to swear","Bought this product back in the summer of '08. Thought it was great. Around the same time I noticed Stanley's website with all the testimonials claiming that owning one of their pieces was better even than having a dog.After 8 or 10 uses soup left in a hot car would run boiling hot to lukewarm in less than 4 hours. Had to go back to the books on that one. Made sure I was prepping it with the boiling water and filling it all the way full, yada-yada. No use.When I e-mailed Stanley about the problem there was a new one on my doorstep in a matter of days. Hey, I admire a no-BS return policy but when it's the same piece of junk you just end up hoping it will fit in the recycle bin."
1,Made-in-China garbage,"I bought three of these, one for tea, one for soup, and one extra. They sometimes work fine if you baby them, sometimes not if the gasket falls out as I explain below. The one for tea fell about a foot and a half out of my locker to the floor. Since that fall the unit is useless. I cannot hear anything rattling inside, but the vacuum seal is certainly broken. If something is going to break that easily, as other reviewers have also complained, it should not be so highly priced. Also there is a white plastic gasket between the bottle and the lid. Often the gasket will fall out when the lid is screwed on. There is no way to check, but when it falls out into the liquid inside, the food loses heat fairly rapidly. I can get much less expensive vacuum bottles that will break just like this one so why should I pay more?"
5,Best thermos EVER,Keeps your food hot FOREVER. We fill ours with boiling water and then close it for 5 min and then put our soup or pasta or whatever inside ( pour the water out first). The food stays super hot all day long. Love this thermos.
5,Stanley 17oz Vacuum Food Jar - works great for hot lunches,"As my kids were getting a little tired of having just cold sandwiches for lunch, I bought one for each of my two fifth graders to bring hot lunches to school. Works great for soups, leftover rice, and pasta. According to my kids, food is still steaming after sitting in their backpacks for 5hrs with or without preheating the jars with boiling hot water. Jar is more than big enough to fit a good size meal for them. Works great and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a food jar to keep foods hot."
5,The genius of Charles Dickens,"This series is well worth the time invested in watching Charles Dickens' classic unfold. I never understood it so well reading it in High school. Until I saw this version, which is so well acted, the incredibly complex characters of Dickens world do truly come to life. There is so much merit in the many messages projected in this series from what brings real happiness in life to who is a real debtor, to what constitutes a good and noble person. I will watch this series again and again, as there is so much wisdom and insight to gain from seeing it over and over.At first the different English and French accents may be hard to follow, as we are not so accustomed to hearing these dialects but with patience it becomes clearer and more easily understandable. Well worth the time and patience."
3,Moves a little slow,Moves a little slow for me. I normally enjoy these period pieces but don't know if I'll finish this movie series.
3,Matthew McFadyen! Love him!,"I watched Little Dorrit just to see Matthew. His acting skills have such layers and his voice has such passion, anger, confusion, etc. that he is always a joy to watch!"
4,"Thanks, Amazon!","I could not understand what some of the principal characters said in conversations. I give it 4 stars because subtitles were needed. The plot and historical background were excellent. I have a difficult time reading a good book because it's hard to lay the book down until it's finished. And the same was true for this engrossing movie. Thanks to Amazon for unlimited streaming of all episodes. Why is it labelled ""Season 1""? Googling did not produce any reference to a second season for this BBC/WGBH Boston presentation."
5,Little Dorritt,Little Dorrit is a very well done miniseries. They did a good job of capturing the mood of Charles Dicken's tale. I enjoyed it!
3,Good addition to any Chevy truck enthusiast's library.,"I really enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover. This book has a nice blend of color pictures, stories and interesting historical information. I find myself picking it up and perusing the pages quite often. The author has a nice way of blending in the historical data with the rest of the information. I personally would have appreciated a chart containing number of vehicles built per model year to be somewhere in the book. The trucks pictured are stunning."
3,3 stars,"This book is okay, I would have wished for it to be in hardcover but it is still nice, especially for the price!"
3,Disapponted,This book was confusing at times. Not as clearly written as the review on the back cover says. I read the Lange Cardiovascular Physiology book and it was written much better. I am probably being overly generous by giving this book 3 stars.
4,Excellent resource!,I purchased this book as an adjunct to my required textbooks for anatomy and physiology class for CRNAs. It is concise and well organized. It will be great to take with me when I travel for clinical time in my program.
1,what a POS,"I could not recommend a worse book. You are better off with a BRS series or Lippincott's Pathophysiology. Unless of course you feel the need to be lost in unnecessarily dense material, then by all means this is the book for you. I am sure there are merits to this text, but as a medical student and not a pulmonologist, I fear I am simply blind to them at this point. I hope for the student's at LSU sake that this guy is a better lecturer then writer."
2,Dozens of typos in the Kindle version,"Dozens in just the two chapters I have covered so far. Essentially any formula that is inline with the text of a paragraph has errors. Many times it is a minus sign replaced by an equal sign. Capitalization in formulas is also problematic, e.g., showing Pa for ""alveolar pressure"" instead of PA, which is standard convention. Someone using the text as a quick review might be able to get by, but for a first exposure to the material this would be crippling."
2,A tourist's view of hacker culture,"This is a generally terrible discourse on hacker culture. Interpretations are often misguided. Academic discussions are pretty obtuse. For a book that appears to claim that hackers are not criminals, it certainly spends a lot of time talking about how hackers are criminals. The only part of the book that's useful and interesting is the history of hacking. However, these gems are few and far in between and could have been condensed to less than a dozen pages. This leaves over 200 pages of what amounts to a nark trying very hard to not sound like a nark."
3,okay product,"I was expecting the gel to be hmm, like a gel, but I realised unlike the gel which came with my electrolysis system this product dries out if the cap is left open and its not of a smooth consistency. It has a bit of crystallization which makes it harder to apply. But once you get it on, its quite effective.Does its job well."
1,False advertising:(,"I ordered this specific item and they sent me a tube of green electrode gel specifically called ""signa gel"", which I found elsewhere on the net that sold for $4.00 each tube. Not only is this price-gouging but the advertising picture is inaccurate. They ought to be ashamed of themselves."
2,It's dwarfed by the Windfuhr recording.,"The Windfuhr recording of this opera conveys a vastly superior projection of this awesome opera. This isn't only because Windfuhr is a superb conductor; it's also because Botstein plays this music like anything but the cosmic work that it is.Windfuhr's Die Liebe der Danae combines the cosmic Strauss Bohm Elektra, with the etherial Strauss Bohm Capriccio, with the ecstatic Strauss Sawallisch Intermezzo, all together in one astounding work of art: the culmination of Strauss and of all musical art. Thank you, Richard Strauss; thank you Ulrich Windfuhr."
2,New and better recording,"...The overall interpretation is better than the one by Botstein, in particular the orchestra, which I found under par, and almost amateurish at times, in the Telarc recording. Kiel's opera house orchestra may not be the Vienna Philarmonic, but it's professional and, at least, it doesn't make me cringe as much as with the ASO..."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!,This is some of Parkers best recordings on one cd. You will want to listen and listen to this cd.
2,"They Sound Like Buffy Characters, They Just Don't Act Like Them","Like many, many others, I really wanted to like this book. It was very appealing to see how the story might continue after the end of the television show. And, to Nancy Holder's credit, the characters' voices and mannerisms are vintage Buffy. Unfortunately, the characters don't really grow and develop much and the plot is a disjointed, non-credible mess, in which things happen to the relatively passive and hapless characters. All of that might have been tolerable, if a bit disappointing, but for the ending. . .which can only be described as bizarre, bewildering, and generally god-awful."
3,Disappointing book,"The book tries to serve as THE reference tome for everything that followed the end of the last season of Buffy. In truth, the book is required reading for real fans of the TV series, regardless of how good or bad the writing is. Given the importance of the subject matter, the book is a tremendous disappointment. Quite simply, too many events were packed into one volume, and in turn, rarely was any subplot developed well enough. If the book was viewed as a TV series, it would very well comprise half a season of episodes if written correctly. The TV series was wonderful in its development of character and plot, and the books should do that even more. Here the complete opposite happened. So, disappointing...but must read!"
4,Not bad . . .,"Overall, I enjoyed this. I read it in a day, and it does move the Buffy plot-line past Season 7 and into its own. This book, with a little bit of filler, could take a moment as the next entire season of the season.My only problems were that I'm still not sure what happened at the end (after reading the last chapter three times), and the original opening chapters went into too much explanation of everything. I guess that's to help those who didn't watch the series, but I don't think there is much chance that this would happen.Overall, I liked the writing style, and I thought the characterization was close enough. It got better and more like the characters as the book progessed.I think this is a good book for those who want something after Season 7."
2,Not What Was Hoped For,"The best that could be said about this book is that it takes the story line beyond the end of both series. Don't look for any real closure on the Angel/Buffy/Spike triangle or even any REAL answers as to just what takes place in that famous alley after Angel says, ""Lets go to work!"" It just isn't here. Hopefully, however, this WILL mark a trend as to future books, taking us beyond Sunnydale and Los Angeles. It would be nice also to hope that sometime in the future, SOMEBODY begins to write something for the ADULT fans of Buffy and Angel, and I don't necessarily mean R rated stories, just ADULT themes written from an adult's prospective."
2,What a disapointment!,"I was really bummed out when Buffy ended, but even more so when I read this book. Not because of any sad ending, but the bad story. The idea was good, but it was executed poorly by the writer. Not the witty dialog from the show, nor the intriguing storline was in this one. I have to say I was greatly disapointed. I found myself skipping pages and bored. The immortal was lame. The mention of Spike and Angel was o.k. The only good that came out of this is the hope that maybe more Buffy AND Angel books will be written taking place after Sunnydale and L.A."
2,"Great book, until the end","Wow, the book did a good job of filling in the bits and pieces we gleamed from season 5 of angel. The chicago hellmouth was well done, as were some other things. But OMG the ending was forced. I have no idea to even begin explaining how bad it was.The spirits of Angel, spike, illyria, and gunn were transported by the powers that be to help Buffy save the world by making a child that what? sucks up all evil? and then leaves them to die? the slayers obviously should have stopped whatever the apocalypse was and then went to LA to save angel and co.god the end was a cop out. only buy this book used. ;)"
2,Had so much potential...,"There was so much potential in this book. It sounded like a really neat idea and I like how it pulled in pieces from the last season of Angel but the time I was 2/3 way through the book I knew I would not like the ended because there was still so much that could happen that I knew to book would be rushed. I do like that fact that the comics took one thing from this about which was about Buffy, Angel, and Spike. To me at the end of this book I felt like 99% of the new slayers were dead. Also the big bads were killed off way to quickly and easily. I don't even remember reading they died or who killed them only that the battle was over....."
5,Season 8,This was a great way to keep another season going. I believe that this book was well written. It also talks about the angel series also and tells what kinda happened to angels elite group during their last battle. I really enjoyed the book and hope to see another one after it but i doubt it.
2,Angel or Spike?,"With this book I was hoping to know more about the Buffy Italian experience and the meeting with her beloved two vampires. I was disappointed, because the story is nice but the end is too unbelievable (the mistic daughter!). When will we read, finally, the choise between Angel and Spike?Camilla"
3,Queen of the Slayers,"Nancy Holder needs to be given props for working around the guidelines given to her, and for working her storyline so artfully around Angel, Season 5. And without giving the ending away, I can't properly express what I really feel about the book, except for saying that I choose to ignore the last few chapters and substitute that reality with my own. Too many loose ends and madly outlandish plot twisters for me to feel comfortable saying that it was worth it. Read Spark and Burn twice instead. Haha."
3,Solid Product....That did not fit.,"I bought this camera lens attachment, unfortunately it did not fit the camera lens as described...:/ The product itself is very nice."
4,"Nice strap, very comfy",Not dissappointed at all with this strap. The diesign is nice. Gives it some character. Thick comfy soft leather.
4,It's good for the price,It's a good sturdy sword rack. Despite the assembly instructions it does require some glue.
4,Great Product,"It's a great product! I really like the crimpers, and the surestrip all-in-one tool. I was not at all impressed with the punchdown tool. The product got here on time, as soon as I got it I repaired two Ethernet cables I had, it worked great!!! I recommend it to anyone!!!"
5,Fascinating historical tour with a unique story approach,"A thoroughly entertaining and enlightening perspective on the evolution of our social and personal environment --- famliy, government, sex, religion...Much in the vein of Michener, but with a unique storytelling approach. The book follows the history a family (that is, the same INDIVIDUALS) as they are placed episodically in ten ""golden ages"".It's chocked full of interesting insights into the times of each age, while at the same time developing a set of consistent personalized characters that the reader can embrace.Looking forward to the next of the series"
3,"Good, but needs to be continued","I had previously read Kirith Kirin, so this novel made sense and was a welcome return to an interesting world. Overall the concept of the intersections of worlds of magic and science, and the philosophical and theological ramifications is a very interesting one. Plus I now understand what all those appendixes in Kirith Kirin were about.However, the novel does rush to a sudden end, which wasn't good after so much build-up in the body. I hope Grimsley plans to write more."
2,Only half a book,"This is a fragment of a book. While it is well written, has good characters and some very interesting concepts, it fails for lack of a plot. The story seems to stop right when it should just be getting interesting. This is a pity since everything else was in place to make it a truly good book. I was very frustrated and disappointed."
1,"Large towel, poor construction","I was looking for a large hooded towel to dry my large baby/toddler. This was about the only one I could find online at the time, so I ordered it. It arrived very nicely packaged with tight stiching to keep it together. Even though I very carefully undid the stitching, the towel unraveled in many places after only one wash. Furthermore, the hood has a padded area that makes it very cumbersome to wear (falling over his face) as he comes out of the bath. A large adult towel would do a better job."
2,Theory not Practical Advice,"As a begining ESL teacher without training in this area, I was looking for a book that included practical advice,such as needs assessments, lesson/unit plans, etc. Many reviews lead you to believe that this is a great overall book that includes these things, but it is not! This book is a text book for a ""Teaching ESL"" class. All theory with almost NO practical purpose. If you are interested in language acquisition theory etc., then this may be the book for you, but if your looking for a book to help you teach an ESL class - don't waste your money. I'm very sorry I did."
4,"beautiful poster, small pamplet rather than book though?","This large poster is stunning, with luminous stars, labelled systems and great legends. Beautiful. Took me ages to find a copy to buy and am now looking for the southern hemisphere version. Only 4 stars because the printing could be better and it's easily damaged."
3,Smells Nice But....,Smells pretty much like air freshener or fabric softener. Some of the other floral attars I've purchased from Attar Bazaar smell like air freshener as well. I'm wondering if the oils are derived from natural plants or are these synthetic fragrance oils. It looks like I'm going to end up using it as a home fragrance oil instead of a perfume.
1,Without depth or substance,Chinmoy uses new age jargon to mask the fact that he is uninformed about the subtleties of the subject matter. He is neither a philosopher nor is he spiritually adept. He uses his PR skill to lure unsuspecting youth to his cult. Don't buy his books.
1,Did not work for me,"Despite the label, I found it to be greasy, irritating and I was breaking out for weeks before I realized that it was the cause!It is terrible, and the only reason I bought it was because the pharmacy was all out of Banana Boat Sunblock ""Faces"". I would not recommend this product."
3,Regarding the Dictionary of Accepted Ideas,"DICTIONARY OF ACCEPTED IDEAS: Flaubert's Devil's Dictionary, a mildly entertaining frivolity which displays a great deal of irreverence through the affectation of sycophancy. There's ""[n]o need to have one single precise notion about it: thunder against."""
1,Not as shown!,The picture is completely inaccurate- I received 4 or 5 yellow and red - they look like match sticks. I could not return them because my son had already seen them. Picture and what I received are 2 different things!
1,Picture doesn't match product.,"This picture does not match the product that was delivered. Now, I am going to have to take extra time to send it back, which defeats the purpose of shopping online."
4,Great boys Gift,We have purchased several Blast Pads for birthday gifts. We got one as a gift 8 months ago and it is still hanging in there. Lost 1 and broke 1. Overall not too bad. My son and his friends all love it.
3,"wide waistband, but the mesh is rough and scratchy","I like that the waistband is very wide. But I don't like the mesh which is rough and therefore scratches the insides of the thighs while walking, running, playing, etc."
5,VERY WELL MADE!,"Excellent product - far better than anything I have been able to get at Sports Authority or the like. Reminds me of jock straps I had years ago - very good support and the product has wide straps for comfort and support. To top it all it has a made in usa label. The stitching looks good, elastic seems quite durable and will post an update on how well they manage to survive the washing machine and dryer.**************update August 28, 2011******************Have washed them several times and stand up to a warm wash well. I have not used the drier so I cannot comment on how well the elastic holds up. Liked it so much as a matter of fact I ended up ordering a dozen - just in case the company that makes them in NC decides to ship the manufacturing to china!"
3,"Quality good, sizing is not quite right","I ordered three of these in XL. I have about a 39"" waist and they are too tight. Too bad I opened and washed them all first. So I went back to old familiar, and order a few of the Duke Pro in XL. Nice jock."
2,all my guys complain,"that the cup is too stiff. All I can go by, is what I'm told...I don't need one of these, lol"
4,danner UV lamp,"the company was very easy to work with - very responsive customer service. unfortunately, the lamp was not what I needed."
1,Old Delinsky material is misleading and not very good!,"I have read all of Barbara Delinsky's books. Of those books, there have been a number of rereleases. What is annoying is that alot of romance writers are doing this, and their material is not always as good as the current price of a paperback. If a book was released in 1983 the price of the paperback should be lower, and the cover of the paperback should also have an indication that this book has just been rereleased with the current content untouched. I'm from Ottawa, Canada and this paperback was very expensive. Alot of money for an outdated storyline and not much of a story to tell."
1,Skip this one,"CARPENTER'S LADY is a disappointment from the second chapter on (the first chapter was promising). Obviously, the publisher wants to cash in on Delinsky's name. Reprinting this lackluster, outdated category romance (an old Sihouette Special Edition, originally published under the pseudonym Billie Douglass) isn't going to earn any new fans for the author though. Save your money."
1,Skip this one,"I heartily agree with the other reviewers. Picked this up on a whim at the grocery store and should have read the reviews first. I too overlooked the first page, which indicated the original release of 1983. It was a typical 1980s romance - forced advances with no build up."
2,Steeple-Chase Romance,"This book was indeed a quickie, in more ways than one. First of all, the romance came together too quickly. Chapter two ceased the intensity of the infatuation stage when the two characters were already touching. BORING. Not that touching is boring, but when you read a romance novel, you like a little bit of anticipation and challenge between your characters. Secondly, I would liked to have read more about Graham and his relationship with his long lost daughter. Seems that the plot was quickly thrown in at the last minute and wasn't very interesting to read. Tug at my heart strings with rekindled love, between family or intimates, and give me an ending that will make me sigh. Don't get me wrong, the story was cute, but I think most romance readers like a little temptation and saavy, not a steeple-chased love story."
1,Terrible Book - not up to Delinsky standards,"I have enjoyed Barbara Delinsky's books but not this one. It was bad. Really bad. I found myself skipping every other page and then reading every third page until I skimmed through the rest. The characters are thinly drawn. Their ""hidden"" pasts are not that interesting. The male and female lead characters were too good to be true, as were the rest of the supporting characters.I was thoroughly bored and hated this book."
3,I wouldn't say to skip this one...,"The story is a good one but I do see what several of the other reviewers are complaining about. It is a reprint and you can definitely see the difference between BD's earlier and later writings. Yes, the sexual pull between the main characters isn't as intense as stories written today. But I did enjoy reading it for an easy, sweet love story that wasnt real intense."
4,Another Delinsky Success!,"""The Carpenter's Lady"" was a quick read; a story that flows well; interesting characters both struggling not to give in and yearning for someone to trust with their secrets. I liked it, although it's not as intriguing as Delinsky's ""Coast Road."""
3,light weight reading,"A pleasant, fluffy, easy read.You can read it in a few hours.Very light weight fare.Pleasant characters with some nice dialog.A reprint of a book Delinsky wrote early in her career.Along the lines of a pleasant but far from literary harlequin romance.I wouldn't want to pay full-price for it."
2,"Sorry, but...","Without Jimmy Ryan, Haste the Day sounds like every other generic screamo band out there. This album is (at best) unmemorable."
2,A New Direction for Haste the Day...Too Bad,"Sorry, but I have to agree with many other critics of HTD's ""new direction."" This isn't a bad album, and probably has the best production value when compared to their other releases, but Jimmy Ryan (to me, at least) was Haste the Day. I have NEVER in my entire life heard anything like his vocals onBurning BridgesandWhen Everything Falls- yeah, I've heard lots of vocalists, lots of ""screamers,"" but Ryan has a unique quality to his voice that I've never heard replicated nor perfectly described. Check out the first two minutes of ""Substance"" fromBurning Bridgesand I think you'll know what I mean. I'll continue to support these guys, but I don't think it would be a bad idea to change their name...to a lot of people, this just isn't Haste the Day any more."
4,Descent album,"This is a pretty solid album. Not a big change from the first two major releases. Personally I thought the first two were better, but this is a very descent album"
4,WOW!!!!!!,"This album is pretty cool. It's a whole new approach for them as a band and it reaches new levels, but the only thing missing is Jimmy Ryan's voiceon vocals! I'm not saying I don't like the new vocalist, but it's too clean. With Jimmy's voice you can hear the hurt in his heart. But I dig HTD and will always support them. And btw. I'm from good ol' South Africa. Go on, and support the cause and possibly the best christian metal band around."
5,Haste This!,"I've been into Haste the Day since Burning Bridges and I know that their first singer Jimmy Ryan was sick on screaming vocals.. you can't deny any of his talent on songs like Substance or American Love but with his departure they had to find someone and I couldn't be happier with their pick. Haste the Day still have all the great vocal parts and they still have the sick breakdowns thrown in for fun. The production is fabulous on this record so I'll point that out as well. There are very few CDs where the last track keeps you wanting to let the CD repeat itself but Chorus of Angels is that song and it provides the perfet ending. I really have to hand it to HTD, it takes a lot to come back from a singer leaving but they should really proud of the effort and it's a really enjoyable CD from beginning to end. The DVD is really good too! It's got a lot of footage and Jimmy's last show with them.. well worth it to seem the play Blue 42! I won't spoil it. Keep going HTD!"
3,Good not great,"Each album by haste the day is good, but get less and less hard. There is still a good amount of screaming, and hardcore sounding guitars, but the poppy melodies get to be a little much. Still good, but not their best stuff. I recommend burning bridges over this album"
4,Good Book,"Hi,This is a good book. However the Kindle version was sloppily converted making it hard to read. I listened to it audibly though and it was good.This book gives you a introduction of a basic rundown on corporate recruiting. A good overview for a novice.Thanks. God Bless.Aaron."
5,Very Useful Book.,I'm just starting out in the field and found Dakotta's book to be just about the most germane and pertinent work on the subject that I have seen. Totally indispensible for anyone who's trying to get a foot in and make something of himself!
4,Why aren't the full lengths this good?,"As much as I've tried to love them, I never could fully embrace The Get Up Kids. There always seemed to be some energy and passion missing from their music. These songs suprised me, however. The ""Red Letter Day"" portion is very good power pop that actually comes off quite energetic. The songs are quite catchy, albeit a bit surface-level. The ""Woodson"" half is more traditional emo fare, with ""New Found Mass"" sticking out as a great track. There's nothing revolutionary here, but this album is a lot of fun. The pop fan inside you will be thoroughly pleased."
5,Classics,This truly is the very best of Dr. D!The scottsman and Star trekking and... well you get the idea. Buy it! you'll love it.
5,kinda deciving,"My best friend and I love Pirates of the caribbean and I purchased this idem as a birthday present. They are beautiful cards and if you like surprises these definaltly are, I just kinda wish that the actual cards I viewed were the ones they sent me, wished they had shown me all they had in stock."
3,"This in no mere massager, oh no.","hi I bought this to use in a legitimate manner for a massage, NOT A BUTT."
1,Absolutely terrible.,"I love Spahn Ranch, and I have been into them since 1989, but this is a verry dissapointing album. Mostly slow downtempo experimental pop music that is lacking all of the essential industrial and coldwave ingridents that Spahn Ranch is famous for. This is by far the worst SP album, and unless it's selling for under $3 I don't recommend it to anybody unless you just have to collect every SP album."
4,"Comprehensive WRT national gold, platinum, palladium coins","This tome offers a comprehensive look at just about every nationally issued gold, platinum, and palladium coin. Specie are listed by country. All photographs are black & white and lifesize. I believe private issued coins are not covered. For all the listed coins, the mintage numbers, dimensions, and estimated value are provided.All in all the most complete reference to gold, platinum, and palladium coins you will find in one book."
5,From Novice to Expert,This is the catalog that has it all. Solidly researched and well illustrated. It is a gold mine of information all on its own. From novice to serious collector the information is useful.
2,"Great Looking Show, Not Comfortable","This is a beautiful looking shoe, but it is not something you could walk in for more than 2 minutes. The material has no give and your feet feel like are smashed all day. I wish they were more comfortable because they're so stylish."
2,missing the discussion,"This edition is well-printed, on good quality paper, and has an interesting introduction. It includes the woodcuts, the music, and the poems from the original book. However, it is missing the accompanying discussion, which comprises most of the original. I only purchased it because I didn't realise this at the time."
2,Not for sports,"I was looking for pinnies for scrimmages both for soccer and basketball -- something the kids can move easily in. This is not it. These are plastic, they're stiff, not breathable at all, and with the open sides & elastic tabs, it's easy to hook a finger and get them ripped off. These may work for crossing-guards or when you need to identify teams for anything beside active sports. After returning these, I got some mesh ones that work a whole lot better."
5,Good product for the price,I mix this 50/50 with dextrose and add to my PWO shake recommended mix by [...] seems to be doing the job.
4,Very useful,"I enjoyed very much this product. I use as low speed digestion with the dextrose, which is a high one, to still give energy to absorb the proteins from my whey"
4,Good Stuff,"Works exactly as advertised. If you need carbs added to anything, just add a scoop. Realize 8 lbs is a lot though, so make sure you have the storage set aside before you order it!"
3,low quality carbs.,"It's malto dextrin 100% That's like eating table sugar by cups. It's best to stick to Yams, Potatoes, and nutritious breads to gain carbs and doesn't mess up your digestive system!"
2,"nasty, stick, powdery, pain in the neck",it shipped to me in a box and when i opened it i found the original package was already opened and the contents was spilled all over the inside of the box. this stuff is so FINE and DUSTY every time i came near the box my breath alone would send power all over the room! forget trying to pour this stuff into a new container! youd lose half of this to the air in the process. its just plain bad bad bad
3,Does'nt mix well!,Product has almost no taste so that is not an issue but it does not mix easily and leaves clumps in your drink.
5,As I grew up I always loved the stories of Epaminondas,As I was growing up I always remembered my grandmother reading Epaminondas and his Auntie to us. Every time she read it to us we asked if we could take it home and of course she said no. She told us that the other grandkids liked it also. She passed it on to my mother and now she reads it to my kids and nieces and nephews. She always tried to tell us it was out of print and impossible to find. We search everywhere and finally we found it here on Amazon.com.
1,An Ugly Brutal Story,"This is the story of a [handicapped] black kid, who is not only stupid, but cruel. He brutally drowns a puppy in the course of the book. My mother showed me this book around 1950 when I was eight years old. It made a very deep impression on me, and helped me realize the obstacles I would have to overcome in life. For me, it was a helpful dose of reality. Scared me half to death, but made me realize that as a black kid I had a heavy cross to bear and that I would have to earn self-respect where others might take it for granted."
1,The Most Egregious Form of Racism,"Reading some of the other reviews on this page shocked me. Turn the title around, and you find the ""moral"" of this book: Sadnonimape, which looks conspicuously like 'Sad No-name Ape'. This isn't a coincidence, and nearly drowning a puppy because you're trying to 'cool it before carrying it home' is not typical childish ineptitude. This book is racist to its core. The writing, the pictures, all convey derogatory stereotypes of black people. Anyone who does not understand these things has not fully recognized his or her own subscription to these stereotypes. I doubt anyone still says ""My laws a-massy!"". Please keep this book away from children. As a reminder of this country's shamefully racist past, this book succeeds, but any argument that calls this book benign forgets that before burning a cross on someone's lawn, you have to do the subversive, yet sometimes seemingly innocuous work of reducing that person to a stereotype such as that presented in Epaminondas."
3,no dimmer,It's a nice lamp but a bit thick at the top. The description mentions a dimmer which I was counting on but this lamp does not have a dimmer.
1,Out of Date,"This book was a disappointment. The copy I received has 1993 and 1998 copyrights, so despite the tag ""Revised Edition"" on the front, it is not a recent revision. That makes all the difference in the world when you are writing about the topic of travel safety. Because this book was revised several years prior to Sept. 11, 2001, a great deal of the information is out of date and useless. I found myself not trusting anything in the book. I was disappointed in The Safe Travel Book not only because of its outdated information, but also because it seems aimed at executives and diplomats rather than the average traveler. In addition, the presentation is dry. I found myself skimming the pages rather than reading them.My recommendation to the author would be another revision, which I hope is in the works. And a few personal stories would liven up the material."
5,EXTRAORDINARY!!,"Colorful and highly personal portraits of people from every nation, tribe and tongue accompanied by inspirational comments and quotes. I love just viewing a couple pages at a time and meditating on the incredible variety of self-expression of human beings as well as our common humanity.This book will appeal to those who enjoy artistic but realistic depiction of people, culture and ordinary life. Those interested in world missions will find this book a wonderful prayer reminder.I've already given copies of this beautiful coffee table book to 5 friends and am planning to purchase and distribute several more. It's rare to find a gift so universally appreciated."
2,A fan gone mad,"This project is every mega-fan's wet dream: the chance to make a feature-length film about the subject of one's passion, only to override that subject with one's own ego. Claudia Heuermann is essentially the star of her little film. She relegates Zorn, his music, and the Downtown New York milieu to the sidelines so she can muse droningly about the art of filmmaking and how important she is to the process that's supposed to be happening here. Each time this film shows some potential to give us some depth -- through the music if not its evasive subject's own words -- it fails, drifting off to another of Heuermann's musings about film and, less often, Zorn. There are dozens of prime concert clips, interview fragments, and other teasers in this film, but they are simply left as that: teasers, reminding us briefly that the subject is supposed to be Zorn and not the director. Now someone needs to come along and *really* make a film about this misunderstood genius, Zorn."
4,Pleasant reading for those who like suspense without disgust and shock.,"I recommentdReginald Hill mysteries to those who like mystery with a bit of wit, humor and literary referances. I have read all of them."
2,Maybe Next Time,"Besides one dimensional characters and a contrived plot, the author exhibits a strange fetish for dashes. The must be a hundred of them in the first 50 pages. What happened to the more appropriate comma? The editor and proofreader have much to answer for also. The typos and inapprpriate words are very distracting.Having gotten that off my chest, the three main characters are likeable and worth giving another chance, given the experience the author has gained with this venture."
4,"Notable for illustrations, text and setting","Beautifully illustrated and simply written, this version of the ""Silent Night"" story hit home with our family as we are descendants from the little-known, but incredibly beautiful Austrian Tyrol, the setting for the story. A copy is being sent to 80-year old Tyrolean grandparents (in NY) to enjoy!"
5,Definitive Study of WWII,This set of books is the definitive study of US Naval action during WWII. The level of detail is good and the personal accounts by those involved are enlightening.I have read all of the volumes and I find they do the best job of explaining and describing all of the naval action of WWII. These set of books are highly recommended.
2,Long winded but not comprehensive,"One might wonder how a set of volumes of this size can be lacking in important details, but it must be remembered just how all encompassingWWII really was. Often the various episodes Morison describes are misleadingly brief. His account of Midway, for example, is an utter disaster. He seems more interested in promoting the victory's significance than in actually providing an accurate account. Morison was closely involved in many actions : this is a very poor position for a historian to occupy. Unfortunately, Morison had a sackful of prejudices and personal hatreds (he despised Halsey, for example, as a commander who didn't show him enough respect). Take this into account when reading Morison's descriptions of Halsey and others. Never depend on Morison's accounts - always consult other, more objective histories - you may start your research with Morison, but you must never end your research there. He is simply too opinionated to be fully trusted."
3,An ok Nazi exploitation flick by Bruno,"This Bruno Mattei exploitation flick goes along the lines of ""Red nights of the Gestapo"". However, Mattei's remains a more typical exploitation flick. The plot has simply to do with a spychpath SS officer commanded to recruit and ""train"" a squadron of whores to unmask traitors among high ranking German officers. The first 60 min of the movie has a good dosis of nudity, simulated (not bad) sex, and some less than ok violence. The last 30 min should be fast forward. Overall, a descent one for its kind.Technically, another Exploitation Digital release that comes in widescreen image format. The audio comes in English (dubbed) with some brief Italian inserts. No subtitles are provided. Extras include an interview with Bruno Mattei and some trailers."
1,BAD,"this didn't fit my car. They said it did though....It shipped ok and arrived on time, but I couldnt use it. So what good is it that it shipped on time? NONE!!!"
4,nice one! try this!,"This book really touched my heart especially the second novel entitled Obsession. I don't really love books and reading, I just made it for our book report which is usual in schools. It is about three women who resemble the Philippines, very beautiful and almost perfect. I don't know what was in that book for me to love it but maybe because I am a Filipino, and I know what really is happening. Jose pointed things out indirectly and in a very creative manner. You can relate everything in the story in our real life, only if you take a second look at it. It's really nice even though some of my classmates do not understand its importance but I sure do. So, I am recomending it especially to those who love their country and at the same time, has a creative and beautiful mind. This book changed my way of thinking towards literature, books and novels."
2,or 1.5 stars remake of orig not any better..,orig. had near end an interesting umbrella monster w/ bev. garland and jon haze of lil shop of horrors-he looke dif. . this film was good for this special fx and girls zapped and the room portal. not enough visual or exciting monster action at all.
4,Not a bad non-porno flick,Tracy Lords is cast as the main blood pumper for this I believe alien vampire sorta. Only a little nudity. Tracy is trading porno for drama in this Roger Corman classic. Get this one if you like being confused. No spoilers here.
1,I tried...Really-to like this movie...,"I bought this dvd for 2 reasons.Monique Gabrielle and Jim Wynorski .If not for the audio commentary-it is completely unbearable.Luckily,the one actor who had character was the commentary co-host.After Death Stalker II,I know Mr. Wynorski is/was capable of much more.This was sad really."
2,This would be a great XXX movie.,"I gave it 2 stars just for all the boobs, this is Just a bunch of porn stars wanting to be actors, total soft porn movie, the acting is as bad as you think when you put a porn actor in front of a camera. The writing is a joke and direction was on a need to know bases I guess. If you are looking for a lot of T&A and don't really care about the story, this one's for you. The so called actors need to stick with hard core porn and leave the acting to those that might really have talent."
2,A horror Fan,Remake of a 1957 Roger Corman quickie. About an alien vampire coming to Earth to collect blood for the dying people of his planet. I dont know if this is horror or comedy {which could work together but does not} The only good thing about this movie is Traci Lords always nice to see her.... I wish I had spent my money on something else.
3,Hot Stuff!!,"Tracy Lords livens up the old Roger Corman remake with some real ""stuff"" Ths dialogue in this movie is very funny and campy. The screenplay could have been written by the same group who wrote the early Batman Films( Adam West ) /Lots of nice girls in various states of undress get "" chicken fried"" by our fiend from the far off planet of Debana(?)Thankfully, some of the props used are left over from the origianl film with Paul Birch. A Black 1956 Caddy, the ol interplanetary screening room..and even the annoying salesman selling vacuum cleaners..same sport coat ..same cleaner?The film lacks the real tempo and suspense of the original with Beverly Garland..and sadly enough...there is no Crosley refrigerator for storing blood in the remake...Campy & Sexy"
3,Traci comes alive,"This movie turn out to be better than I thought. Even though the movie is somewhat predictable, seeing twenty year old Traci made it worthwhile for me."
4,Good Quality,"Pros: Church is well scaled, molded and assembled. Cons: Church windows should look like they are stained glass and bushes should not be painted on. (I modified this church after I received it)"
3,"Not bad, but not the best compilation...","Now it often makes me wonder, who chooses the songs in cd compilations. Don't get me wrong....This cd was pretty good. It has a lot of good songs on it, but there are so many others that I could name which should have been on this album instead. Plus there are only 10 songs on this album and the songs on here are all classic, but definitely not the 10 best classic rock songs of all time."
4,A Planisphere anyone can read!,"I saw this Guide To The Stars a few years ago and thought is might be big enough for my failing eyesight to resolve. Last year I got my first telescope (I've been using binoculars for years) and and this Planisphere came to mind to guide formal observing and identifying what was framed in the eyepiece! On easy-clean, flexible plastic, its as big as a large pizza at 16 inches and the area outside the sky field is filled with hints, tips and notes under headings such as Spring/Summer and Late Winter tours, Star Magnitudes and the full Greek alphabet in the comprehensive Chart Notes.On the reverse, a series of notes for 'first-timers', objects (including many Deep Sky Objects), the Moon and Planets a smattering of Mythology, Celestial Tidbits and an Astro Timeline from 4240 BC to 2012 that spirals around the outer edge!As a (very) mature beginner, the Guide To The Stars is a very useful and comprehensive introductory tool and I really like it."
3,Item okay. Order was not.,The design of planisphere is just fine w/ good detail and is easy to read. But I ordered a new one and received something much less than that. The plactic was cracked and broken and there was black blotches on part of the star map. Obviously used. I promptly returned it to Amazon and they refunded my full price - including shipping.
2,Guide to the Stars,"Guide to the Stars Review: Purchased with good intentions, unfortunately a let down! This only gives a couple hours window on the wheel to find the stars, your out of luck for any other time. Look at the picture good, look at the couple of hours you are given on the wheel. Buy something else!!!"
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased this item after reading all the good reviews on it. I was purchasing this to replace my son's Peg Perego John Deere Gator. The shipping was fast, but the battery will not hold a charge for more than a few minutes. Every time I charge it, it is dead within a few minutes. I called to return this item for a new one and was told I would have to pay for shipping!?!? Ridiculous. Who charges you to return their DEFECTIVE product. The customer care department for this company is rude, not helpful and a waste of time. I will never purchase anything from here, nor will I recommend this company. Save your money! Shop elsewhere"
4,Still Going Strong - Does not Include Peg Perego Harness,"I bought this last June to replace an original Peg Perego Gator battery and it is still going strong. Note that this is only for the battery and does not include the blue plastic holder with handle and the wiring harness with the battery terminal connectors - so don't throw away the old battery assembly. I had to cut off the old blue plastic holder and detach the connector plugs from the + & - terminals on the battery, but I used duct tape to re-attach the original blue holder - EASY. I had to wade through a bunch of reviews till I saw this and decided to go for it anyway. In fact, the original battery on the other Gator we have just went and I'm buying another today.I do keep my gators in my attached garage over the winter to minimize cold affecting the performance and longevity. We'll see how long it/they last."
5,"Good product, awesome price","This is the original equipment that came with my grandson's Little Tikes H2 Hummer. I ordered two batteries from Amazon for the same price as my local Walmart charges for one battery. The price included shipping, which was FAST!! The batteries were fully charged on delivery, my boys were able to use their Hummer in the time it took to replace the depleted battery. I would recommend this product and vendor to anyone."
4,NP12-12T battery,Great replacement battery for my grandsons power wheels. Less than 1/2 the cost. I had to modify terminals but that was easy for me especially considering the price.
5,great service,The service and product was great! Thank you so much for helping me make my child's power wheels ride again. It's awesome! Thank you.
1,ears hurt,"the sound of the earphones are decent, and i like the build where it goes behind the neck, but the cord that connects the acutal headphones to the audio jack is strange. first from the actual headphones, there's about 6-7 inches of wire, then the wire starts to wind into itself, as if it were a telephone chord, that goes on for about 5 inches of wound wire which can stretch for around 4 feet no problem, then it goes back to straight wire, then it's the little remote where it lets you control the sound, there is also a mute switch on it, then theres about 10 inches of wire till the jackwearing the earbuds is like sticking a pen into your ear and applying some pressure, not enough to bleed, but enough to cause irritation"
3,"Great sound, but a little tight.","Love the sound and volume control on these. The cord length for running is perfect. The only improvement I would suggest is to loosen the headpiece somehow...it's irritating on the long runs. But, I love the fact that they don't fall off no matter what!"
3,Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?,"I purchased this CD for song number 18 on Disc 1, Nothing As Original As You. This is the only Statler Brothers CD that contains this song. It's a song about visiting Washington, D.C. The song, of course, is well done as are the others. However, how can a two disc CD set of the Statler Brothers that contains 42 songs be complete and not include Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott? I would think that when you include that many songs in their CD set that somewhere in those 42 would be one of their most popular songs. It is an obvious glaring omission."
5,Joan Brill; as incomparable as one can imagine !,"Joan Brill's versatile touch on the keys is beyond reproach. I could have listened all evening to the varied selections she presented in ""Piano Encores by Joan"" As a matter of fact, I did! .....salute'....gz"
3,Small Poster,"I guess its my fault for not looking closely at the size of the poster, but it is really small(just larger than a piece of notebook paper). Also, when I ordered it, it said that it would come between 2-3 days, and then when I looked at the expected arrival time it said closer to 11-13 days. It finally arrived in about 13 days. Overall, I would recommend paying more money for a bigger poster because this one is SMALL."
2,Wilton Holly Hobby Girl Cake Pan,The seller exaggerated the quality of the pan. It was dented and bent. The seller promised instructions and they were never sent. Wilton did have instructions available online so I used them and the icing hid a lot of the faults in the pan. I would have purchased the pan from another seller if I had been told what the pan was really going to look like.
2,Nasty and Loud,"This CD is the first of his I've listened to and was not a good choice, I'm afraid. Too much of a disconnect without a specific melody for my tastes."
5,An Old Billy the Kid,"It seems that no incident in history is free from the revisionist historian. Now it's the turn of Billy the Kid.The conventional wisdom is that he was killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett on July 14, 1881 in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. But after the shooting Pat Garrett called out to the deputies nearby, Boys, that was the Kid, and I think I have got him. But upon seing the dead man's face, the other deputy said, You have shot the wrong man.Nearly seventy years later an investigation involved with and estate settlement began to lead to suspission that one of the participants was actually Billy the Kid. And after some discussion the ninety year old man admitted that he was indeed the Kid.This book details the investigation and the life of the Kid after having been 'killed' in 1881.Is there evidence? Yes! Is there proof? No! Is it an interesting book? Definitely!"
3,Very interesting book about a fictious old man.,"Mr. Jameson is a very good author with the uncanny ability to sway your thoughts and beliefs. I bought a copy of this book when it first hit the market place, not because I believed Brushy was Billy, but just to find out if Mr. Jameson had anything new to say. Of course, I wasn't surprised to find the same old material being written with a little icing to make it more interesting. I have read every book and paper that was ever written about Brushy Bill, and I must admit, this book is one of the most interesting to read, but it is not all convincing. There is NO real proof to back up Mr. Jameson's case. In fact, there is just too much proof available to prove that Brushy Bill was an imposter, fake, and liar. So, if you do read the book, remember that it is pure fiction and should be taken that way."
3,Ok at the right price....,"This book seemed a bit confused. While promising ""hot"" erotic pictures, most seemed more concerned with being ""artsy"", filling the book with what has become pretty standard content in ""erotic"" Photography. When the price is low the book is alright, but I would never spend Coffeetable prices for it."
5,MMMM!,"I have been looking for a book like this and I am so glad I took the chance and bought it. From some of the comments I was a little weary about what was in the book! But it wasn't too bad, definitely not for the vanilla folks out there!!!! But there were all sexes and types in this book! What I really enjoyed were the real homosexual couples in this!! Real butch ladies and men and it was so hot! Water sports and disabled people and middle aged people. It was all beautiful in its own way, even if it wasn't exactly the ideal you'd have for erotica. All human beings love and need love! I feel more comfortable with my body after Photo Sex. I think you should check it out too."
1,You won't receieve what's pictured.,"Although the case pictured above is black, if you order this item you will receive a brown and orange Belkin Kaiser Flip Case. Yuck."
1,Very flimsy parts and crackles after first wash,"I bought two of these purifiers after watching a tv program. I was really surprised to find how cheap all the parts are for something that costs several hundred dollars (that's what I paid when I purchase it). It worked pretty well for the first few months but after I rinsed it (exactly according to directions), it started to crackle. I called Oreck and they said it crackles when something gets lodged in there. I wonder why it didn't do it for ths first few months. Overall, I'm very disappointed with this product and will never buy another Oreck again."
2,Don't bother!!!,"It's expensive and the ad on TV look impressive but don't be fooled. The unit will work reasonably well for awhile, but it is GIGANTIC PAIN TO CLEAN. There isn't really an more delicate way to put it. Truly, dealing with these units SUCKS HUGE You have to soak the cleaning cell for hours and hours, buy a ridiculously expensive cleaning agent and, and waste vast amounts of water to get this thing anywhere near clean. Then the Oreck people themselves recommend waiting up to 24 hours for the cell to dry. You can do all of this and then the damn thing starts popping (indicating that the filter should be cleaned again) just days or even hours later. It is maddening and I will NEVER buy another Oreck air cleaner. I won't even go into the amount of ozone they produce which is a very bad thing for folks like me that are asthma sufferers. There has to be a better item out there to keep you air fresh. Do your research and stay away from the ORECK."
4,Oreck XL Purchase - Used,"The product was as advertised and the seller even ""threw in"" some cell cleaner and extra carbon filters. The price was very attractive, too. The product was sh9pped as promised and received sooner than I expected."
4,oreck tabletop air purifier,"Arrived as scheduled. Some damage to packing box. Happy with the product, although it takes more effort than described to clean filter unit."
4,It works!,"Filters cigarette smoke, what else can you ask for? Nothing else has done that and I've been through a half dozen other brands."
1,This thing does NOT WORK!,This is piece a junk! It does nothing but blow air and make loud noises. It's cheap and flimsy. Get an AirBunny! This product SUCKS!
5,Great game,"My 4 year old and his friends love this game. Not too hard,but not too easy. They like that they can change vehicles and it's not just puuting out fires. I highly reccommend it."
5,Perfect Question,What to Say When you Talk To YourselfThis book brings up the perfect question that people should ask themselves. This is the question that direct live and Dr. Helmstetter explains it so clearly. It is a fantastic book to take a look at how the brain works and getting things done.
2,Only for certain metals,"I bought this book and found it to be very thorough with recipes and pictures for hundreds of types of finishes. However, I did find the title misleading. The recipes are only for copper, brass, bronze, and silver.The metalwork I do is with steel and I bought the book to color steel. This huge medium is never dealt with in the book."
3,Encyclopeadic? Yes. Very useful? Kinda.,"This book is encyclopeadic--there are at least a thousand recipes. But only about 1 in 4 has a color picture to show the results. I'm sorry, but color pictures are a must. The word descriptions simply don't suffice, especially when one is looking for a very partcular look.Contrary to what other reviewers have said, there are only sixteen pages of color photos in the book.A lot of the recipes should only be attempted by persons that are very safety conscious. Some recipes contain strong acids or strong oxidizers that must be stored and used correctly.The metals covered are: bronze, brass, copper, gilding metal (aka red brass 90% Cu, 10% Zn) yellow."
5,A must have book for anyone working in bronze!!,As a sculptor working in lost wax bronze casting I found this book an invaluable resource for applying patinas. A Must have book!
3,Very telling of the times,The book is right up there with the works of shakespeare. I enjoyed in thouroughly. it is a classic play which depicts the roles of men and women in literature during the Enlightenment.
1,Against the topic: the unremarkable historical review,"An remarkably boring book that talks about everything but risk. The author spend 3/4 of the book describing historical formulation of strategic models that derived to become the modern risk management concepts. The rest 1/4 are scientifically inaccurate references to the stock market. The writing is conceded, historical facts were blurry, and none of the models were throughrally explained.This book is rather a historical cliff notes of who invented what mathematical theory."
2,wasted erudition,"What a waste of erudition!A wormanlike treatment of a fascinating subject.This well researched book is a hybrid that is completely useless to practitioners and, I guess, rather tedious to non-professionals."
2,Not what you think,"This is meant to be a story about risk. As a story, it only modestly succeeds, although the author is obviously not comfortable in the medium of history, and is given over to numerous redundnacies. As an essay about risk, it is sorely deficient, giving only the most superficial features, racing over complicated opportunities to explicate, and failing to plumb the depths enough to give satisfaction. Risk, of course, is a sub-species of probability. That's the book's thesis. I'd recommend a good book on probability theory before wasting my time with this."
2,"A ""History of Probability"" book with a good packaging.","As a person who works in accounting area, I am always amazed by the genius of the double-entry method of book keeping. Hence when I read a review that the book includes this as one of the attempts to contain risk, I decided to buy it hoping to hear more about the making of the method. Unfortunately, there is only one paragraph mentioned. The rest of the book is dedicated mostly to the story about probability and a few other chapters on something else.If you regard ""Gods"" as the ones who throw dice and you want to know the story of people who wanted to predict the outcome of the throw and how much to bet on it, you should read the book. Otherwise, there is nothing much regarding the attempts to overcome other kinds of risks, which are no less important than probability. Hence, the naming of the book is somewhat misleading. Instead, it should merely read "" History of Probability"" which may shy some readers like myself away."
5,Unique ability to capture the attention of all readers.,"Bernstein brings alive mathematics and how it has affected all of our lives and our ancestors over the past 5000 years. This work is that of a great historian who can relate history with real business applications. And, to top that off, he is a terrific story-teller. This is a ""must read"" for all business people, investors,economists, teachers, designers, and those who think mathematics has little to do with their everyday life"
1,probability good; Wall St. ridiculous,"I read this when it came out and thought it was pretty good. The first half, about how people figured out how probability worked, was really entertaining. The end, about how the geniuses on Wall St. conquered risk, is so wrong it's hilarious. Bernstein is a victim of what Taleb calls the ludic fallacy -- mistaking well-defined games like craps for the truly unpredictable.So go read ""The Black Swan"" or ""Fooled by Randomness"" instead."
2,Pedantic Drudgery,"Unfortunately this book ends up reading more like an encyclopedia than a 'remarkable story'. Bernstein's account of risk is painfully dull and poorly related to risk's wide ranging applications. The closing chapters on financial markets and derivatives feel like they were just thrown in, providing an awkward ending to a pointless trip."
4,An interesting historical treatment of human risk decisions,"This book was recommended to me by my otolaryngologist, why I do not know, unless it was prefatory to our discussion of the risks of neck surgery. I found it primarily helpful to realize the amazing precocity of the mathematicians at very tender ages. I in turn recommended the book and gave it to my good friend, an actuary, for his library (not for mine)! He commented that he was aware of all the material, but would peruse it anyway, just because I recommended it! Since I am a retired Judge, I have no knowledge of risk(!!!)"
3,Interesting first half - pity about the math,"I found the first half of this book quite well written and packed with interesting anecdotes about almost-famous historical characters. The second half seemed to be mostly of interest to those in financial services rather than a general readership.The book does contain one great annoyance though; a lot of the math is just plain wrong. My own math not being fully up to scratch it took me a while to figure out that I wasn't going crazy, there really were serious errors in Mr. Bernstein's calculations of probability.A version of this book with corrected math and a more general focus would be a very good read."
4,An entertaining Quant reflection,"This is an entertaining account of the most memorable market crashes in recent history replete with anecdotes from the life of a high-profile quant. If history can teach us anything about the current market conundrum, it could be learned from this book"
3,"Collect for your library, but not for your reference shelf","A daunting task, to try and catalog the development of risk analysis. For that the author must be commended for his painstaking research. However, sloppy editing (spelling & algebraic errors) does take away from the overall impact of the book and thus relegates it to the not-so-favourite stack."
4,A good introduction to the use of statistics in investing,An intertaining and lively introduction into the use of statistics in trying to understand the stock market. The book was well written and the author gave an excellent review of the evolution of mathematical thinking about probability and its relation to investing. I felt my time was well spent reading this book.
2,Ok if you know nothing about Probability and risk,"A little to simplified on the mathematical explanations. Misleading in the explanation in economics. He is a big fan of Keynes and I would agree that Keynes wrote a great book on probability but his economic theories have been shown not to be sound. He runs into some wrong conclusions based on his understanding of ""animal spirits"" and the crowed mentality. A better historical and fun book on probability and randomness is Taleb's ]""Fooled by Randomness""."
3,Mixed Feelings,"In ""Against the Gods"" Bernstein mainly discusses the evolution and history of risk from ancient times to recent times. Bernstein explores risk through the great thinkers who contributed to the advances made mostly in the field of statistics. ""Against the Gods"" was rather interesting, well-written, and quite suitable for the layman. However, I felt that a broader discussion of the effects of the improved ""risk understanding"" had on commerce, businesses, and on society in general was missing."
3,"Well researched , but a bit dry","As a statistics and economics teacher, I naturally jumped at this book. But while I found some parts to be interesting, I didn't love it. All too often, I found it a bit boring -- not nearly a page turner, like When Genius Failed, Fortune's Formula, Fermat's Enigma, or many other books that Amazon puts on the boat. It read to me more like a history textbook on a niche subject -- not really what I was hoping for.I did learn a lot from reading it, but I found that I could only read one short chapter at a time before nodding off."
4,Economy for those who have given up,Risk is a key issue in money affairs and this tome gets all round under over and inside this important issue.Pity the bloke is dead we could do with more of his work.
5,fantastic,"for many years, i have been the owner of this wonderful book. i re-read it and keep on learning about risk. i trade and invest in the local market (Philippines), and am making good money."
4,Excellent overview of the history of financial risk management,"Against The Gods is a popular account of the history of financial risk management. The author takes us through a journey of discovery spanning almost a thousand years, from the introduction of Arabic numerals and the concept of zero, to the most sophisticated derivative instruments of modern finance. At each point in history when a great leap forward was made, the personalities involved are introduced, and the advances they are credited with are explained. All throughout, mankind's age-old struggle to measure and control uncertainty is seen to stumble time and again against the same, seemingly insurmountable problem: There is no guarantee that what happened in the past will continue to happen in the future.The book is highly recommended for anyone seeking to understand the origins of modern risk management and what the concept of risk really means."
4,"Gripping stuff, but dense","This is a book well worth reading for those who want a look into the history of probabilities and forecasting (or lack thereof). For mathematicians I'm sure it's light reading, but for the layperson it's a wee bit (just a wee, though) on the technical side...moreso than I would have expected from all I've heard. Still, it's gripping, if a bit dense, stuff and will open your eyes to the risks you thought you would never -- or would always -- take. Recommended"
3,"Example on page 134 is in error, or badly stated!","The book is fascinating, but I have a problem whenthe examples are sloppily done. Page 134 is a mess.I'm amazed the author didn't do a better job of havingsomeone proofread/edit his work"
2,Disappointing - Not really about the stock market,"I bought this book because it was suggested after I ordered other books relating to the stock market and investing. My initial impression after reading the reviews (before ordering) was that it dealt mainly with risk associated with stock markets, but after reading through, I find that it is more of a history book - related to risk, yes - but with very little content or correlation to investing. There are snippets and references but even after half of the book is complete, there is no definite flavour on investing.For those interested in the pure historical development of probabilistic reasoning and risk, this is a well researched book, but for those whose are misled by the notion that it helps you to understand these risks in terms of the market, well, you've been misled."
2,Story versus Thesis,"The topic is interesting, but the minutiae of the story makes it difficult to stay engaged, and as such, reads more like a very dry thesis. So, the phrase: ""Story of Risk"" might sell books, but it does not accurately address this book. I did not feel engaged throughout the reading of this work, and this belies the problem with the asymmetry of title and book.However, for academics and teachers, the book does give detail which may be used to ""spice up"" lectures. This may prove to be its number one utility.My own barometer of whether a book is truly five stars is measured by its life on my bookshelf. I have a finite sized bookshelf, and yet the number of books being published is something for which an end of publication is difficult to see. As my attention was drawn to this book again, after seeking out other ""Black Swan"" books, I can tell you that my hardcover is looking for a different venue for its life time on my bookshelf is now in question."
2,too big and diffuse,The reader would be better served by reading a primer on probability and a short article on the evolution of probability. There is no talk of heavy tailed distributions and the finance stuff has been done in much better ways a thousand times before. Too much of a reading input for too little return.
3,"An enjoyable, non-technical look at risk","Except for the last three chapters, this book provided an easy to read, yet complete history of the math of risk. Assessing risk is something everybody does every day. Reading this book will give you pause next time you assess a risk, even a small one like ""should I get up this morning?&quot"
5,Fabulous!,"I couldn't stop reading this book! Granted I am merely college educated, so some apparent errors mentioned in other reviews did not glare at me. The overall message is awe-inspiring. I am sending copies to friends and family"
4,Will reshape the way you view the world. Guaranteed.,"Fascinating book. I confess I couldn't understand all of it, but nevertheless it is a compelling story of man's quest to predict how the future will unfold. Great historic vignettes. You'll be richer (figuratively and, perhaps, literally) for reading it."
2,interesting in parts but very dry,"Some interesting stuff in here on the history of risk management, but overall this is an exceptionally dry book, and this coming from someone who reads a ton of non-fiction. Took me several months to read, and only really made progress first on a plane back from Europe when I had finished everything else and then when I made myself finish books I'd started before buying new ones."
3,Unpretentious and pleasant,"Bernstein is an interesting writer since he is the consummate finance insider- a practioner, regulator and academic. This range helps and harms the book - in his efforts to render the history of risk, he delves into anecdotal caricatures while amusing definitely smack of basis risk with the underlying ideas that are provocative enough! I found the behavioural finance and derivatives section to be rather basic but then realised the book was written in 1996. It's a pleasant read but a more pragmatic introduction to probability is the infinitely witty Cartoon Guide to Statistics."
4,Functional,"I have the AT&T 8260, and it fits fine in this holster (the Voicestream phone is actually smaller and slimmer, so those may not fit as well, but I'm not sure). This holster is probably comparable to the StarTac holster, although this clip swivels (which I have yet to reach a opinion on -- sometimes I like it, sometimes it's irritating).It is definitely a good alternative to a leather case. The spring and clip on this one appears to be a little more robust than other 8260 holsters I've seen. The platic seems to be of higher quality than those I've seen as well. I'm not quite sure this is worth $..., but I've heard that the StarTac holster costs the same, and this seems to be of the same quality.The holster leaves your phone face-out, so there is some chance of scratching the face if you're not careful, but I'm not too worried about that. Otherwise, I have no real qualms with this product."
2,Not very durable,"I enjoyed this belt holster for it's style, price, and small footprint. Unfortunatly, the swivel base cracked after about two weeks of use. Anytime you snag it on a seatbelt, chair arm, or article of clothing, you run the risk of cracking the plastic. My father also had this problem with the exact same result. If you are extra careful while standing and sitting with the phone on your belt, you might not break the holster. If you are like me, however, the idea of a belt clip is so that I don't have to think about carrying the phone around all of the time. That is why they keep making these things so small, so we can just attach them to our body like a piece of jewelry. Anyway, I will end up getting something more durable in the future and I suggest you consider the problem in light of your personal phone carrying habits."
5,Stunning Arrangements,"These artists were unfamiliar until a friend introduced me to them. While I have some background in the history of Persia/Iran and Islamic principles, it is not enough to provide a good cultural context for the music. Nonetheless, as music that is rather ""exotic"" to my folk/blues/rock ears, these tunes are evocative of the awe-inspiring and mysterious. I guess that this is something along the lines of the submission to Allah that drenches Muslim devotion. I highly recommend the album, if only for the attentive artistry and sense of mood with which each track is rendered."
5,"An excellent introduction, continued","This volume takes a substantially different approach when compared against Volume 1 of the series, Discourse as Structure and Process. Volume 2 is less oriented toward the linguistic micro-scale and broadens the theoretical concern to the sociological level of analysis. Thus, it might be easier to approach for social science readers without a strong background in formal linguistics, and indeed is sufficiently different from Volume 1 so that one can read it independently. Wodak and Fairclough's chapter on critical discourse analysis (CDA) is one of many strong points in this volume.Highly recommended."
1,"the conversion was truly ""pointless""","Installation was very easy, but getting the car to run has been quite a problem. I seem to have opened up Pandoras box as I now have an electrical gremlin that I can't seem to locate. I put the old points back in last week and still can't get the car to fire up. It ran before I started the conversion. I'm not saying the e-spark unit caused my problem, but if your car runs with the points in it, like mine did for 50 years, why change? I'm sorry I bought this unit."
4,updating;,"Starting to update VHS to DVD and some Blu-ray and Amazon is one of the best places, any problems, and I know I can count on them to fix it."
2,Worth the money,"Definetly worth the money, especially if you are a David Niven fan. A good group of films that show the WWII mentality of the times. A good DVD to add to your collection."
4,"Great camera, problems with CCD","Resolution outstanding and worth the effort to learn the complicated controls. CCD failed and required two trips back to Nikon over 5 weeks to repair, now working OK, Nikon responsive on status via their email service support."
2,"""System Control"" Failed after a year: $244 Nikon repair","Except for it being unresponsive (by the time it's ready to shoot, the moment is gone) it's been a good camera for the 16 months I've had it... but it failed recently, and Nikon had little to say about why, how, or how I could prevent it from happening again. In fact, the people at Penn Camera seemed to be surprised that I wanted to know exactly what work was done (""Nikon never gives that information""). After explaining it by way of analogy---""what if when you picked up your car from repair shop, the serviceman said 'we fixed it... you don't need to know what specifically was wrong, or what we did, you just need to pay up' ... how would you feel? Seems criminal, doesn't it.""---they came around, but still couldn't tell me anything.So... I'm no longer a happy Nikon customer. If you're thinking of buying Nikon products, factor reapir costs in to the price."
2,Electronic Problems,"I purchased the Nikon CoolPix 5000 camera in late March, 2002. Three weeks later the electronics went dead. The camera was returned to Nikon for service. Three weeks later it came back and two weeks after that the elctrronics failed again. It is now back in Nikon service. I have requested the camera be replaced with no response from Nikon."
4,Can't See in the Dark,"I have had this camera for a while now, and I have taken some excellent pictures with it. I use a Macintosh, and it works with the computer beautifully, in contrast with the Olympus camera that I owned previously. The adjustable screen is nice and the zoom suits my needs. However, I cannot get this camera to work in the dark. It just wont. I went searched the manual for an answer and found none. It drives me insane. It's great for daytime shots, but in low light I might as well not have it. I'm still glad I bought it, but I was dissapointed by this aspect."
4,Glad I didn't bust it,"I was very disappointed when I first got this camera. I had a Nikon FM (totally manual) camera for over 20 years and had FULL control over the pictures I took. Once I started taking pictures with it, I was ready to dash it on the rocks! I'd see the image properly framed in the monitor and in focus, I'd press the shutter button, then the lens would dance in and out before it snapped a totally out-of-focus image. How frustrating! I then tried a novel approach: I read the manual! There's a lot of options on this camera to give it flexibility. You need to get acquainted with it before you just go out shooting pictures, or you'll be TOTALLY frustrated. I'm getting better with it and have been amazed at the resolution. It does have its idiosyncrasies, but the more I learn and experiment with it, the more I know how to overcome those. Expect a longer than normal learning curve, after which you'll start getting your money's worth!"
2,Sales brochure does not tell all,"Be careful of this camera if you need filters. Nikon sells a filter kit but fails to included a necessary adapter. In addition, when you use the adapter(required) you can only zoom about 60% of wide angle. Also the literature does not tell you that the wide angle lense will not take ANY filters!!Questionable marketing."
4,Great picture,"I think this is a great camera. It is my first digital camera and I am really happy with its performance. It has only one problem (that's why I didn't give it 5 stars): in a few occasions the flash didn't work very well. I mean that the night pictures sometimes remians to dark.In any case, 99% of the time the results is extremely good."
3,Does anyone know if this camera can be used as a webcam?,"This is a very good camera, but the flash..... it's the worst thing ever.At night it's impossible to take a good shot.And I don't know if I can use as a webcam too."
2,too bad..from a retired after 30 years TV photojournalist,"this is the 3rd nikon digital camera I've had and returned (thanks Amazon).I had the 775,885,and the 5000.For me,and this is a personal observation,they're too damn small!! I have poor eyesight and the screen and menus are too small for me to navigate.sure,you could set it up for idiot proof but why spend $1100 for a totally adjustable camera? I did try a few pictures and they seemed fine but once again I didn't take the time to really use the features.I couldn't.I'm not sold on digital photography for my purposes.you could buy an excellent 35mm camera for 1/3 the cost of the 5000 and buy a $150 scanner and do the same thing.I've used Nikon equipment for 30 years and love them.It's too bad that these cameras don't work for me.maybe they will for you.GO LOOK AT THEM before buying and make sure they are what you want and need."
1,Unstable in the long term,"I bought a coolpix 5000 when it came out about 6 years ago and it took good pictures. It had to be sent in for repairs 2-3 times though because it would make a buzzing sound for a few weeks then die. They repaired it for free when it was out of warranty as a gesture of good will. It died again a few months ago, now the repair bill is $282.50 .. I had spent $2000 on this coolpix5000 and now it's a brick. The new 5100 does look nice, and it costs a lot less but I feel like I wasted my money with Nikon so my next camera will be Canon."
2,Heaven Can Wait - But I can't,"The Nikon 5000 missed the chance to become one of the best on the market, if it had not made one major mistake: it's to slow.A great picture captures the essence of the moment. For most amateur photographers the time delay aspect is of lessor importance, however a Coolpix 5000 customer should expect superior performance. The time delay is way too long between pressing the shutter button and recording the picture. Even using a lower resolution setting the delay is unacceptable for this high-end camera.All other features of the camera are up to par with expectations, which I am more than happy about. Overall the quality of the hardware and the picture itself is excellent.However it is this one aspect of speed that irks me the most. For instance, taking a simple portrait is frustrating, as a facial expression I want to capture has changed by the time the camera is ready to shoot. If this one issue were to be fixed I would strongly recommend the Coolpix 5000"
4,Very pleased with the CP 5000,"I have owned several (seven, to be specific - Olympus, Canon and Nikon) digital cameras in the last three years and, like others, I have constantly upgraded in search of the ""ultimate"" camera! I recently bought the Nikon CP5000 and am extermely pleased with it. The picture quality surpasses all the other pro-consumer models I have seen. If you like simplicity or if you are a control freak...the camera has it all! It accepts a variety of add-ons (lenses and flash units). The only one beef I have with the camera is that it does not make use of all the functions of my external Nikon Speedlite SB-24 flash (which has low-light focus and zoom capabilities). The external flash unit works flawlessly in TTL mode but I would like to be able to use the additional features it offers as well. Perhaps Nikon will resolve this with a firmware release in the near future (as an enhancement) - I am keeping my fingers crossed! Otherwise, the camera is spectacular!"
2,Doesn't compare favorably...,"I had the opportunity to evaluate the Coolpix 5000 VS the Dimage 7 side-by-side and the Dimage 7 won my evaluation.. The image quality is excellent on both, but the Coolpix shows clear signs of chromatic aberration when shooting a bright object against a dark background (I shot a neon sign againts a night sky) the purplish glow is noticeable on the coolpix and non-existent on the minolta.. menus ara also bothersome to navigate on the nikon, and very intuitive on the dimage. Zoom? no comparison here! nikon:3X minolta:7X.You can argue all you want about which one is the best, but to my eyes (literally) the Dimage 7 lens system is superior. Cost is also important, as the nikon will cost you more..For me, the nikon is not the best cost-wise and more importantly, optically..."
5,A True Hit,"DEAN OF UMPIRES:BILL McGOWAN is a wonderful book. Bob Luke has the balls and strikes of a bygone ""Big Leagues"" vividly flowing off the pages.We learn of a fascinating character umpiring during a more innocent era. You don't have to be a baseball fan to love this well written book of a true American legend. Mr. Luke has hit a grand slam! G. Egner, Sanger, Texas"
1,Dean of Umpires,"Not a well written book. Of all the umpiring books that I have read (I have read many), this is by far the biggest disappointment."
4,"Rock isn't dead, it's just changing.","All For Nothings first outing is an exeptional one. This quartet coming from the streets of Staten Island give it there all to put out the music they want to listen to. This being there debut album makes them break out all the stops, giving heart pounding beats and gut wrencing guitar riffs a new meaning. The lyrics can be simple at times, but do ring true with emotion, while the music, with ecceptions, tear right into you and let you know what rock music was and what it can be again. With heavy, yet alluring songs as Food and Dust,Good Things to Come and One Step, you can see this band knows what it is doing and that it has a bright future ahead of them."
4,I hate soccer! Rugby League's better!,"The Pet Shop Boys have brightened up this single with their cracking dance version,but fortunately I detest soccer."
3,PET SHOP BOYS sock it to Europe with JERUSALEM 2000,"This is ""THE OFFICIAL FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION ENGLAND SONG FOR EURO 2000"" soccer tournament, which is a big deal for many Europeans. FAT LES 2000: Jerusalem delivers five renditions of the song with the most notable being the PET SHOP BOYS wonderful radio-friendly remix. Look for remixes soon!"
5,Along comes brother Jean Marc,"This is yet another perfect mix by Challe bros. As with all mixes by Claude or Jean Marc, this album astonishes with tunes which take you back to the 70s and make you feel as though you are in Paris (or your favorite European city for that matter).There is something magic about this album. I like to sit down and immerse myself into the magical sounds while drinking a nice coup of green tea.If you've never listened to Claude Challe or Jean Marc Challe before you owe it to your soul to plunge yourself in the sounds of enlightenment. The journey of one's own soul begins with the sounds of beautiful music.Some songs worth noting:Yarali Yurek - Hovannes K.- Hovannes K. is magnificent. You can find him playing White Darbouka on Nirvana Lounge 3.Visit Op 10 & Visit Op 6 - Pompon Finkelstein- if you like classical music, you'll find yourself replaying those tunes a lot. You can find his Lost in Reflection (La Forza del Destino) on Buddha Bar VIII.Merci, Jean Marc/."
3,Rather a disappointment.,"A three disc set. I have so far only played the 3rd disc (""Just Dance""). After a promising start (track one) there were only occasional short periods of musical interest. Too much ""Doof Doof"" and not nearly enough Good Music."
5,flamboyant & gorgeous musics,Very promising and talented new d.j. Keep going by engaging more world wide musics.The texture is very alive and moody. Could remake the 60's and 70's famous songs into temporary fast beat and tapestry instrumental equipments.
5,Honest-to-Goodness Truth,"My second graders absolutely loved this book. I read it aloud to the class and then they wrote a response. They were asked to tell the lesson of this story, and to relate how they had been like either Libby Louise or a victim. The children were very honest in their responses. I think this book is a must for any classroom discussion. Though it is recommended for 4-8 year olds, the message would be good for all ages."
5,Book donation,My family donated this book through the Temple University Alumni Holiday Book Drive. They listed desired books to purchase then donated them an elementary school. This was an effective and efficient system. I was happy to participate.
3,Do yourself a favor and buy an OEM gasket,"This fits a 2008 Corolla. Got this from Amazon warehouse deals for less than the shipping price. Packaging was the only one damaged but the item is brand new. Price definitely is a big factor but in terms of quality, for me, just a so-so. I used the filter but threw the gasket away as it is thin and appears to be made of cork. Filter is acceptable but please for your peace of mind, just buy an OEM transmission pan rubber gasket from the dealer. Installed this just a few weeks ago, transmission seems fine. ATF still appears clean and with pinkish color. No leaks whatsoever, as I felt secured using an OEM gasket. Only the auto gods know how long will this last."
3,"Easy to assembly,but the switch for the autofeeder just worked twice","Is very easy to assembly but the auto feeder machine that came with the Pitching machine just work twice. Then it doesnt work no more.The ""speed"" is just quick for young boys,so be carefull."
3,"Poor customer service, owners manual","I have not tried the machine yet, but Im upset with Franklin. The owners manual is writtin for kids. It has no specs on the motor. And it states the AC power adapter is safe for outdoor use, but when looking on the actual AC adapter itself it states its for indoor use ONLY.I Need to get specs on the 12 volt motor, but it is not in the owners manual. Emailed Franklin, no response. Called customer service and they have no spec. They only have info from what OTHER customers have told them. The service rep states their engineer would call me, no call back."
4,"Good product, but not as fast as I thought","I wish there was an option to give this 3.5/5 stars, but there's not so I gave it 4.The product works well, and connects just fine to Firewire 800. I have had no issues with it and its definitely made downloading 100s of 8MP photos very easy and fast for me.PROS- Super fast downloads- Easy to use, corrects to FireWire 800.- Small footprint.CONS- Expensive vs. the actual performance increase. I guess I was expecting faster downloads vs. USB 2.0, but I guess just looking at the bandwidth you kind of expect this thing to not blow USB 2.0 devices out of the water.- Only compact flash, no other devices.- If you daisy chain this to another FireWire 800 device and are doing read/write to it, bandwidth (speed) is decreased.Nonetheless, if you want a speed increase, this will do it, but you will pay a little more for it. Highly recommended if you are willing to spend a little extra crash for it."
4,Really Awesome Device.,The speed of transfer is just amazing. Transferring 8GB worth of files took only 12secs. Downside to this device is the price; kinda steep.
2,Lasted six months,"It worked great on transferring our Canon 5D footage from card to computer from July until December. It started to need tinkering to read the cards about a month ago. Now, it doesn't read the cards and all and gets really hot when plugged into our iMac. I need another card reader and don't see any alternative. For $220, it's very disappointing that it didn't even last one year and the returns policy was 30 days."
5,Faaast,bought this item last month and have used it a handful of times to download photos from a Sandisk 4GB Extreme III card and it works flawless and fast. It downloads a full 4GB card in little more than a minute. No problems whatsoever thus far. A very good product at a reasonable price.
4,Solid choice,"I have used several multi-card readers but in moving to more pro model SLR's, I only need the CF reader so my main requirement focused on this format. I did a fair amount of research and while none of them stood out as head and shoulders above the rest, I do use only San Disk cards and have had very good luck with their products. I have used the reader for several weeks now...seems to be somewhat faster and have had no reliability issues. Would buy again."
5,Fast and reliable,I've had several other readers fail.This still works.Sometimes I have to plug/unplug a few times to register.I use it on a mac pro.Loads pics fast.
2,Not as fast as I hoped,I have the sandisc usb at work and this fire one is double the price and not double the speed. If you need one get the usb. It has no wires to hook up and is very fast.
1,Overpriced and under performs. Loser,This is my second unit-first one failed. Second one works if you plug in the card twice. It is no faster than the USB Compact Flash Reader.Save your money-it definitely is not worth it. Beside all that San Val Customer Service horrible if you need help.
5,Recording Sound,"Using this item to record to 8GB UDMA from SD 788T-SSD, eight channels of 24/48k,flawless performance. Easily the best out there (as I think it is the ONLY one out there as of this post!)."
2,Died after two years,"Worked great while it worked. It died after two years of approximately once per week use. That means I used it about 100 times, certainly less than 200, or about 25 cents per use. That doesn't seem like such a great deal."
2,Fails To Connect,"It's fast once it connects, but more often than not I have to pull the card out and put it back in more than once before the computer recognizes it."
3,"NIce, but dead in less than a year","There's not much to dislike, unless you plan on keeping this thing in active service for a while. Mine died after 7 months - in the middle of a download. That event corrupted the info on the card (two other readers couldn't open the files). I eventually saved the 300+ images with Sandisk's Rescue app, but that's REALLY slow (and of course, not guaranteed to work).I'll send it in for replacement under the Sandisk warranty,but I'm not sure I'd buy it again."
4,Time Saver,"I recently switched over to shooting RAW (7-9 meg a shot) instead of jpeg (2-4 meg a shot) so I got myself an 8Gig Extreme III card and this reader. I have used many readers in the past, but nothing has even come close to this speed before.I can put over 1,000 RAW files or about 4,000 jpegs on the card and then transfer them all over to my computer in just a few minutes instead of closer to a half-hour or more. It seems to average around 1Gig a minute.It is also pretty small so you can travel with it easily. However, if your notebook PC has a 4 pin firewire connection, like many do, this will not work. Firewire needs 6 pin or higher to be able to power devices. I e-mailed SanDisk several times about this and they just gave me the run-around, so I did the research on my own to find this out. So if anyone knows of a way around this please let me know because based on what I saw it is not possible."
5,A dream,"I owned a usb2 card reader and it took at least 5 minutes to transfer my full 256 MB compact flash cards to my imac. now I can barely review the pictures in Iphoto while the reader is working, as it takes no more than 10 seconds. Really impressive"
1,major FAIL,"This was a great product and may work well on some computers.Beware - the card reader does work on MBP i7's running 10.6.5.Here is SanDisk's response.""The Extreme Firewire reader predates Mac 10.6.5. When the Extreme firewire reader was release, it was tested to work with almost all operating systems. That being said, it seems that something have change on the firewire of the new Mac versions as the reader works with later versions except for their new one which is 10.6.5. Unfortunately we do not have a firmware update for the reader or any fix. You may need to contact Mac about this for a possible resolution."""
3,Broken San Disk Reader,"I bought this a couple of months ago to download video from my Cannon D7. It started to be intermittent a couple of weeks ago and now I hear a screw or a piece of plastic rattling around. It is expensive and should hold up better, now I have to buy a new one."
3,Card Guide issues,"While this reader may be the fastest one I own, you must use great care in loading cf cards. The depth of the plastic guide is much less than other readers and it is easy to offset the card just enough to damage the end pins as has been proved by some of my employees. Good card reader speed wise, lacking in mechanical robustness."
2,only a half a reader...,am using this reader on my macbook pro with 800 and 400 firewire ports... my external HD is using the 800 so i attached the extreme reader to the 400 port with the included 400 fw cable...no go... it locked up my laptop spinning beach ball of death. reattached external to the 400 port and extreme reader to the 800 and it worked like a champ! very fast. and my external HD runs fine on the 400 fw port... i tried the scandisk extreme reader 4 times on the 400 fw port to no avail - it locked up my system every time!scandisk support is futile... or worse - they let me hang on the phone for 1/2 hr before telling me i had to go to the supplier for help..don't know what to do with this device since it only works on one port - 800fw... it's a loss since for the same price OR LESS i could get a reader that would work on multiply ports - usb or firewire.bummed...
1,"When it works, it's great... but...","I have a number of CF card readers, both Firewire and USB. I bought this for the hi-speed UDM cards (8 and 16 gigs) When it works, it's very fast. But it only works 1 out of 10 times I try to use it. When it doesn't work, nothing happens. No lights, no errors, no nothing. It's often faster to hook up my old readers instead of trying over and over to get this to work. I use Mac OS 10.4"
1,Unusable,"SanDisk should make it clear that you can't actually *use* it, in many cases. This is unusable because most laptops supply only the 4-pin firewire connector. Furthermore, if you happen to lose or damage the supplied cable, you're hosed. It's a proprietary cable on the reader end of the cable. And from what I can tell, Sandisk doesn't sell the cable separately. So they've done their best to make your life difficult.I would recommend instead what I got... the Delkin PCI-Express CF Card adapter. It's even faster, cheaper, and doesn't require an oddball connector that won't fit on most computers."
1,Waste of $$$,"What a lie!!! No where in the description does it tell you that it will NOT work with a Windows laptop. It says it works with Windows & requires no AC power... B.S. !!! If you have a Windows laptop, most likely you have a small (4 pin) firewire port which will not power this unit. Sandisk knows this and is keeping it hush hush. I'm really disappointed with their lack of support. This will be the last Sandisk product I will buy. [...]"
1,Disappointing,"Like the others, getting this connected to my laptop proved fruitless. Yes, I purchased all the additional cables that were supposed to get it connected with the proper pins, but to no avail. It's in the garbage now. Would love a suggestion on a fast way to download huge RAW format photos without the hassle of this device."
1,Does not work on Laptop with XP,I have a 1394 4 pin port on my laptop and this does not work. I even bought a 1394b express card reader (for another $89.99) and this still does not work. Please try on your laptop before you buy. VERY DISAPPOINTING FROM SANDISK. They have clearly marked Windows support - looks like it works only with the Mac.
1,Does not work on laptops,"Be warned, a fast transfer rate is all good but unless you want to lug your PC with its 6 pin firewire port around forget it. I am a photojournalist who works exclusively with a laptop and this product will not work on a 4 pin firewire port - which is industry standard and best practice. What the heck are Sandisk doing with this set-up? I will update this if I ever find a solution. Can anybody help me?"
3,"Paperport, works great with a few minor problems","I am upgrading from Pagis scanning software produced by the same company. I decided to upgrade to Paperport 8.0 last week (3/10/03) Right after I got my copy I saw on the Scansoft website that a new version is out already, 9.0. An upgrade is listed as $....The program works fine. Seems a little less powerful in some of the editing and file manipulation abilities of pagis. It works better with Windows XP. One glitch, it cannot directly import my Pagis files with an *.XIF format! I have read that the new version (9.0) has a pagis importer built in.My overall comment: If you are upgrading from Pagis wait for version 9.0 to be widely available. So I now have to upgrade or buy the newer version to have XIF compatibility?"
2,Basic scanning,"This software performs ok for scanning images, however, I found it extremely lacking for OCR. If you intend to only scan images, this software will perform that fairly easily. However, if you want OCR, DO NOT use this software, or you may as well retype the document you are attempting to scan. There is much better software available for OCR."
5,"The BEST way to a ""PAPERLESS"" life! ... and more","I have tried and tested various personal document management software programs to use with my scanner. PaperPort is the easiest and best! Some of the other products stopped trying to compete and they are no longer sold. PaperPort is a great file manager/viewer for all your work on your PC, but its real benefit comes with a scanner. Just scan your paper documents into PaperPort, then toss the paper (not legal documents of course), and touchup, or write notes on, or fill in forms, or fax, or email, or print, or do OCR into your word processor, or crop and beautify your photos, or ... etcetera. PaperPort is the BEST! It makes your scanner an essential tool in managing your paper-filled life."
1,Poor Support and a product that does NOT RUN on Win2K,I have purchased Paperport deluxe 8.0 to replace the now orphaned Pagekeeper Pro. I've installed the product on a Windows 2000 system with plently of CPU (1GHz) and Memory (512 MB)resources that has been stably running for more than a year. Now after using Paperport for a period of 1-15 minutes the PC abruptly shuts down and reboots. No error messages!It appears that such behavior is preceded with 100% CPU utilization by the Paperport executable. Tech support reported that this is a known issue with the Paperport printer driver in Win2K with no workarounds and no known date of a bug fix. I have been out of [price] and I can't use the program. Further issues with the product relate to its inability to save the scanned files in anything but its own proprietary format meaning that whatever you scan now is forever locked in Scansoft and its support...Don't buy it!
5,Excellent solo debut!,"Bobby Brown's departure from New Edition downgraded the quintet to a quartet. This 1986 solo debut of his spawned the Top 10 smooth smash GIRLFRIEND and later the Top 20 hit THE GIRL NEXT DOOR. New Edition continued as a quintet though,with Johnny Gill succeeding Brown. I always thought GIRLFRIEND was a beautiful slow love jam. Also,in '86,NE released their fourth album,UNDER THE BLUE MOON,filled with ""oldies-but-goodies"" covers. Brown rose to superstardom two years later with his second album DON'T BE CRUEL,a Grammy-winner. He also made headlines in publications like Star,National Enquirer,The Globe and National Examiner when he took the Grammy-winning diva Whitney Houston to be his lawfully wedded wife in 1992. The other songs are excellent."
1,"looks good, but it doesn't last, not worth the risk.","I had two of these, the first one lasted 3 weeks before the vacuum failed, i.e it couldn't keep anything warm for more than 20 minutes. The replacement lasted one week, before two of the three the tiny slivers of 1/32"" plastic that hold the lid on snapped, making it impossible to fasten the lid. thanks to amazon I got a refund, not worth replacing again. It also has an integral design issue where the stopper slightly unscrews (meant for cleaning, but it comes undone itself), which means even though it looks ok, it leaks. You have to make sure it's screwed tightly in place every time you take the lid off... otherwise disaster. all in all this makes this vacuum flask, the best looking i've seen, just a disaster waiting to happen."
1,"Lid is defective, bottle is good, but the lid only lasted me a month with light use","Length:: 1:14 MinsLid is defective, bottle is good, but the lid only lasted me a month with light useSee video review for more information."
2,The bottle keeps losing vacuum,"I was very impressed with this mug initially despite the tricky lid. It was keeping tea hot all day in my car even in the winter. After about 1 year, the vacuum bottle stopped keeping liquids hot. Whereas I could not previously feel any warmth on the outside of the mug, it immediately felt warm. Stanley replaced the mug twice for this defect and now it has happened again. They will replace it again but now they want me to ship them the bad mug at my expense. These mugs don't usually last long enough to justify paying to ship the mug to them. I have seen it fail in less than one month. I suppose that having a lifetime warranty does not mean it is expected to actually last a lifetime."
1,Big disappointment,"My partner and I bought these for Christmas as part of a pledge to take home-brewed coffee to work instead of funding the college educations of the children of coffee shop big-wigs. After I figured out the unnecessarily complex lid, they worked fine. Until one ding on the bottom compromised the insulating capacity.Now, I've had to call and order two new lids (it's 9 months later), which they were happy to send. First the locking mechanism got loose and would unclench as I opened the lid for drinking. I lived with that. But now large cracks have appeared in the threads, making them a leaky mess.I went back to my thermos-brand bullet bottle, which even after dishwashing and dinging and years of use keeps a vacuum seal and keeps liquids hot for 24 hours.I paid $15 for the thermos and $30 each for the Stanley mugs."
2,"tricky cap, unreliable vacuum","Like another reviewer, I bought this high priced mug expecting good performance. Initially, it delivered the goods, keep coffee hot well into the afternoon. Just in the last week, after maybe 90 days of use, the mug has lost vacuum, and coffee is lukewarm after 60 minutes! Hopefully Stanley will send a new one, but just having to go through this debacle is discouraging! I have been much happier with the Nissan Stainless travel mug w/flip open lid, they are much more durable and do a better job of insulating."
5,Best one yet!,"Just as the description says this is not a travel mug, this is a vacuum drink bottle, and man does it work. Aside from being a little complicated cleaning the lid, once you've read the instructions and done it once or twice it's a snap. As far as keeping coffee hot, I am used to having tepid coffee at noon (I leave the house at 7:00am) now I have to let it cool down so I can drink it. I'm not sure what you would have to do to make it leak, it has rolled around in my vehicle several times and not a drop. Well done Stanley, this ones a keeper!"
5,amazing thermos!!,"This thermos was bought as a gift for my husband Christmas 2007. he loves it. He hasn't stopped using it. He's in the Air Force and flies weird hours and drinks coffee all the time from it. He has had no leaks or any other issues. In fact he SWEARS not only does it keep the coffee hot but he is convinced that it makes the coffee hotter. Must buy! In fact, I'm buying another for my father in law this year since my husband loves it so much."
4,Invaluable,"This volume is mostly a reprint of the manuscript mentioned in the title. Adam McLean gives some brief observations on the material and the manuscript's history then let's the user do the interpretation.Why I call it invaluable is that it really constitutes one of the most important links between John Dee and the late 19th century schools of occult (i.e the Golden Dawn and the Aurum Solis). For those who, like myself, question the why's of the correspondeces formulated by the GD (esp. in terms of geomancy) this book unravels that mystery. While Rudd did not actually describe the specifics of his attributions, it becomes clear where the GD was borrowing from. It's catalog of spirits also contain entities from other Grimoire traditions and their associated sigils which probably make it useful for anyone investigating those traditions (e.g. Solomon)."
3,no real examples,"Two things about this book that I dislike are the notationand how there are no concrete examples.There are some subjects or named topics that aren't coveredin some of the other texts which make the book useful.The basic Thue type substitution system:0->011->10is defined, but this basic example isn't given?The Kleene Hierarchy or arithmetic hierarchy is mentioned,but concrete real world examples are not given.So there are good and bad things about the book:I wouldn't try to teach from this text as cheap as it isbeing a Dover book, but I might site it as a referencefor students to look into."
5,Flyswatter Rocks,Flyswatter mixed with Something Is Sacred(both on the Daisies album) are great. The Eels are unlike any music I have ever heard - that's a good thing. Symbolism in the group's songs is a major seller. Buy it.
3,The European Reformation,"The book is fine as far as it goes. Unfortunately, that is the problem. It is a booklet sized synopsis of a very complicated theological and political landscape. The result: too little information about too many topics. It seems to be about the same information one would expect from an average encyclopedia article. If you are interested in an introduction to the reformation, there are much better treatments available."
4,"Playboy has the best women, but their vids lack imagination!","Whoever produced this thing decided to keep it simple, TOO SIMPLE! Too often it's just a girl removing her clothes and then posing, and I'm sorry but that gets BORING after a while! The one scene where the two freshmen engage in a sexy girl-girl scene was nice, but just a bit too tame in my opinion. Still, it was the best part of the video, and certainly the most creative & erotic part! At least Playboy video is finally heading in the right direction."
4,One of the best non-Playmate DVDs,"This is one of my favorite DVDs that doesn't feature any Playmates. Hosted by 3 lovely ladies, Jacqueline Lovell (AKA Sara St. James), Malisa Petropoulos, and Laura Selway, there are 8 lengthy video segments here, each about 6 to 8 minutes.Other Newsstand Special hotties appear here, like Genevieve Michelle, Jeannie Millar, Jovanna Vitiello, Jacquelyn Caswell, Bethany Lorraine, and Elise Daniels.The opening segment where 4 cheerleaders shower in the mens' locker room is quite a memorable sequence, and Jacqueline Lovell's bedroom sequence with another blond is very explicit by Playboy standards, with a 3rd girl, Elise Daniels, as a voyeur.It's highly recommended as a buy, but if you're looking for your favorite Playmates, you won't find them here."
3,nice but then again ive seen better,"like i said in my title, its nice but ive seen better. the girls are hot and look like they could be freshman but im still scepticle about how hard they tried in casting this movie. if u like college porn then u will like this but u have to really like college porn. i meen that this could be better."
4,Almost as tasty as Girlfriends,"Despite the most inane mid-scene bits I've even seen, each vignette on this disc ranges from very nice to downright naughty. Some very hot women are here, with the diner, peeping tom, and dorm room scenes all extremely well filmed and deliciously hot. A few scenes could have been dumped as they're really only going to get you off if your idea of porno is the bra section of the Sears catalog, so it's dropped to a 4. But I'd definitely pick it up if you've worn a groove in your Girlfriends DVD."
2,not worth it.....,"what a waste of money. when you buy a video like this, you expect great looking women. Freshman Class has average women. the girls on this tape look like Playboy walked into random gas stations and picked out the best looking women working there, with the exception of the beautiful cover girl, who gives a great strip scene in this video. this movie contains a shower scene(with some g/g action), 3 girls in a science lab acting like they know what they're doing, a film strip of 3 girls jumping around naked(yippee!), some girl stripping for a guy hiding in her closet, a silly silly lesbian scene, and more crap like that. I personally found Wet and Wild 9 to be the best of the Playboy vids I've seen. but who knows Freshman Class might be your style, but I would suggest renting it before you buy it."
3,"A good buy, some cute scenes","Kind of hit & miss, but several of the little stories are fun to watch. Especially good is the 50's diner (the brunette is the hottest on the tape), and the girl+girl +voyeur girl near the end. Worth adding to the collection."
2,A big disappointment - save your money,Few of the women in the video appeared to be freshmen at all. Some Playmates recounting the the good old days. The girl on girl sets looked like something out of a sleazy sex movie. No class.
1,Don't buy the hype...,"After reading so many great reviews, I expected this video to be a whole lot better than it was. In fact, I was really disappointed. The girls weren't all that attractive, and most appeared really fake and uncomfortable on camera. What's more, the commentary from the three girls who were ""supposedly"" sharing with us their college experiences was a joke. Stay away from this film, it's a waste of your time."
4,Great B-sides,"Money to burn wasn't my favorite song off ""Alone Again..."" - in fact I kinda dislike that song. But Xxyy and Leave me High are great songs that any fan of Ashcroft's first album will enjoy. I consider them better than many of those songs as a matter of fact! Buy this - or better yet if you can find a domestic version, by that and save some dough."
4,A treat for Ashcroft fans,"The b-sides on the ""Money To Burn"" single would fit nicely alongside anything on Ashcroft's ""Alone With Everybody"" album. ""Leave Me High"" is the stronger of the two bonus tracks, effectively mixing some gorgeous strings into the composition. ""XXYY"" on the other hand, is driven by acoustic and slide guitar. Alas, ""Money To Burn"" is simply the album version of the song but the real treats here are the non-album tracks. This is an essential addition to any hardcore Richard Ashcroft fan's collection!"
4,Great for camping with babies.,I bought this to use when camping with my infant son. It sets up easy but you do need two hands to fold it up. You have to be sure you set it up on level ground or it is unstable.
1,Chadko Plastic Shelf Inlays - 18 x 48 Black,"RipOff - is the only word needed to decribe this product. The title says it is plastic, but it is nothing but a cheap cardboard that is less sturdy than the cardboard box it is shipped in. The add reads like you are getting more than one for the price, which I figured was 5 becouse there are 5 shelves on the stand it is made for, but that price of $18.69 is for one only, and with the shipping charges of $14.99 that brings your total to a grand total of $33.68 for something that is worth less than the box it was shipped in. I'v been Rip-off'd in the past ordering over the internet, that is just the risk you take buying sight unseen other than a picture, but I have to say this makes the top of the list for me. I would send it back, but that would cost me another $9.60 in shipping to get $9.09 back ! I guess looking on the brighter side I do have a pattern to cut the box up for another two inlet liners."
4,Good but you have to finish with a razor,"Its great, convenient, but it won't do a good job on the hair below my jaw and neck, I always have to use a regular razor to look completely clean.Battery life is amazing, great for travel, durable."
4,Cars -- A Great Title for the Younger XBOX360 Crowd,Easily understood and fun to play by my 8-year old -- and one of a relatively few XBOX360 titles rated E. Definitely recommended for the younger XBOX360 crowd!
3,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this game. Both my 4-year old son and I loved the movie. However, the game has not held his attention and he has required a lot of help from me to figure out what to do. Here are the other issues:- It's not possible for two people to play at the same time, which makes this an individual game instead of a family game.- The game needs a ""kiddie mode"" that keeps kids on the road. As it is you'll eventually be dropped back on the road if you veer off, but this is frustrating for young players.- The game misses some possibilities. My son really wanted to drive the truck (""Mack""). He's familiar with how you can easily switch characters in the Lego games. Unfortunately, it looks like there's no way to be able to drive Mack.So this game has its moments, but it missed the mark in several areas."
4,My six year old son loves this!,"My son loves playing this game. Though, since he has a small attention span, he moved on to another game in about a couple of weeks!"
4,"Xbox 360 Cars ""McQueen"" great distraction","The game spun off the animation film ""Cars"" for Xbox 360 keeps your kids or grandkids busy for hours; if we let them play that long. It's something they all enjoy and specifically desired for Christmas. The only fault with a disc is that they eventually wear out; no matter how hard you try to keep from scraching them. Knowing kids abuse any kind of toy, no matter the cost; far too many toys end up in the closet. If no one is going to allow us to make backup copies; then we should be able to send in our old one (pay $1.50) for a replacement, which includes processing, shipping, and handling charges. Since Xbox games runs $49 and up; its the least the software manufacture should do!"
1,Garbage.,"In my view the Woofi is in a league of its own as a truly worthless product. I bought and used one of these for a short period of time and couldn't believe how poorly it performed, especially in light of breathless hype from Sharper Image about how can fill the room with sound, etc. The bass that it does produce sounds weak and out of balance with the speakers, and if you try to turn it up to any reasonable volume it distorts. Not worth it even for $10."
1,Didn't work.,"I tried this on my computer, mini-stereo, DVD player, and TV. Nothing worked. Customer service says it only works with ""special"" subwoofer jack!!! Do a little research about this company befor purchasing."
5,Really Good HD ambient,"The video quality in this title is extremely good. As noted in the review by D. Eidam, there are some minor compression artifacts in some of the darker background shots, but even then the foreground is very good. The selection of content was also very good, none of it seems like it should be on the cutting room floor. The inclusion of some time lapse landscapes of clouds was well done and in many places action is modestly slowed down during action.The ambient music is very complimentary and does not detract as it has in some of the other HDScape titles.After Planet Earth, this one is a definite buy (for anyone interested in nature content). If you just want to show off the capabilities of your HDTV, this could also accomplish that, but I'm sure other titles would end up ahead of this one."
2,audio very disappointing,"Although the picture quality is excellent, this film moves very slowly and the commentary is very slow and plotting.Reminds me of some professors I had in college. This makes for grate visual or backgroung to show off your HD capabilitues. Unlike Planet Earth ( The best of both visual & educational) this DVD is just visual. Yes I will keep it, but wished I had purchased something else."
4,Very Good,This hitch is an OUTSTANDING buy!!! I have had it for almost 2 months and it has been great. The thing looks great when I dont have a trailer hooked to it too. It is VERY solid construction. Hell its made in the USA nuff said!!! If I had to say something negative then it would be my reese insert doesnt seem like it fits perfect. It might be my insert too cause that thing is over 8 years old so there really no telling. If I ever buy another hitch I will definately buy another Curt hitch no doubt about it. I hope this review helps anyone who reads it
4,"Not stunningly original, but still great music","It sounds a lot like Dissection to be perfectly honest, but from where I sit that's not a bad thing. The music is well composed, well played, and quite atmospheric. Dark Fortress take the Dissection black metal formula, put their own touches on it, and the result is a very enjoyable black metal ablum."
2,Rainbow Yard Spinner,This is a good idea for spinning color but the wind tears it up shortly after I put it on the fence. The manufacturer needs to make it of sturdier fabric and the spinning center mechanism needs to be made of stronger material. It didn't like the Wyoming winds.
2,find another place to buy one,The pinwheel fabric was sloppy - poorly cut with strings hanging all over the place. The lower post broke almost immediately - they are hollow - the last one I had was solid. I had to make a replacement for that. Would I purchase another one - probably not from the same manufacture? But I like the design and the way they spin when working correctly. The base that is inserted into the ground is WAY undersized. I used my old base.
5,Spinner for the yard,"i love these colorful spinners. i have given them as gifts for weddings, christmas and for my self. i love the color as it wildly spins."
2,Faulty,This item falls apart if the wind gets over 20 mph I have found this item to be very disappointing. I will hesitate in buying another one like this.
2,Problems,"The directions for this product should include gluing some of the parts when assembling. The item blew apart within two hours after assembling nd mounting in our yard. We gathered all the parts we could find and were able to use substitute parts for those that were lost. Again it blew apart. I then glues some parts together but made the mistake of allowing sone glue to run where it glued the large wheel to the axel. So the product is not useable. If we find another product locally, I will glue some parts together befor mounting the wheels. I not feel like ordering another from you at this time since I had so many problems with this one."
1,Worse Acting I've Ever Seen,"I rarely rate anything 1 star, certainly not an underground production. But this? I can't believe this movie was so terrible. The music was ok, the story was ok, the acting was horrendous.Story: guy and girl meet at some kind of parolee program, girls mom gets sick so they get back into the street game to get money, and they turn into bonnie and clyde. they rob and kill about 100 people and get away with it. girl gets pregnant and they leave the game. They are working for a man named Fats who is introduced to us raping a man who wronged him some kind of way. that was a funny scene. they leave the game and go back to their regular jobs. fats comes back and gets revenge because the guy left his organization. the guy comes back and gets revenge on fats and the movie ends. there was a good twist in the end. i liked the twist. otherwise i'm mad i spent my money on this."
3,adequate,"Fans of Redman, the Lost Boyz and other such artists will probably like ""Statistic"" more than me.The Statistic's poor direction made it difficult to follow what was going on. However, I got used to after it after a while.The image quality however was top notch. Very few DVDs look this good.The director's comments (not included on the VHS to my knowledge) were not very good. They brought no additional enjoyment to the movie.Overall, this DVD was just OK."
3,Passable,"Declan is highly overrated. I listened to all his albums noticed that his skills deteriorated over time. This album is the best of the lot, but it's not fantastic. Just barely passable."
4,Declan is amazing,I first heard this kid on youtube and he was amazing at 9 years old. I don't know why he isn't more popular in the US.
5,Declan - An Album Of Perfection,"This is a boy with a golden voice. I found this CD just ... splendid. It is, indeed, a very rare CD - it's perfect.The 6th track ""Your Friend"", I think, has a little too much repeating, but the lyrics are beautiful, so it really doesn't matter. As I heard Declan's ""Walking In The Air"", I was just totally blown away. His voice, to speak the truth, is the voice of an angel. When Declan sings ""Cerrickfergus"" and ""Amazing Grace"", it's like he's singing straight to God (I'm not a Christian, but I just had to try to explain those two absolutely wonderful tracks on this perfect album). I believe Declan has a voice that will live on - for a much longer time than his own. For right now I'm looking forward to his 2nd album and I'm very excited to hear his voice the way it sounds today - 4 years later. But I'm sure it will be great.Like Billy Gilman, I believe in Declan Galbraith to make a legend in his own lifetime."
5,Bravo DECLAN,"What I may to tell you about this boy? He should be heard alive! Very powerful voice, such that already grasps spirit!!!!!"
5,Nothing but praise.,"I have spent over $70 for this and his self-titled CD (Declan). And I can not recommend both of them enough. The single only has one unique track from the self-titled cd, but the 3rd song is good, and Declan is so masterful at what he does. I have absolutely no regrets in purchasing these two CD's, and would gladly pay more even to this day. Declan is by far the most talented, and pleasing artists I have ever known. Thank You Declan For All Your Superb Work!"
4,Old Time Revivals,"I especially enjoyed reading about how the power of God fell on people back in the old revival days, the things you've heard about but never really saw yourself."
4,In-depth coverage of the last batteships,"The authors have done a good job with this book, offering more on the techincal aspect of this class of battleships than found elsewhere. There are several color schemes shown, and details on various modifications over the years to allow more detail to come through. I do wish there had been more on the process of modernizing these ships for the last time under President Reagan, but this does not detract much if one is seeking information on the ships themselves. If used as a reference on WW2, it will not be entirely useful, but for its technical help, this book is great for modelers."
2,expected something different,"When I first saw this item on your cite, I was looking for another band named Tait (the christian band, with front-man Michael Tait.). I truly was excited about ""the 25th November,"" and since I could remember Michael Tait refering to his group as a coverband, didn't think it unusual for them to have a previously released CD. But, unfortunately I have been decieved. I thought it to be the same tait because I found both titles on the same page. On another note: ""Empty,"" (Michael Tait's album)is 1st rate, and ""The 25th November,"" isn't to bad."
5,This Album Makes Me Fly,"TAiT offers in this album a powerful potion of thought accompanied by a vast depth of musical intelligence and soul. Tracks such as ""A Form Letter to My Friends"" and ""Unfound"" offer a great combination of powerful guitar and ethereal vocal melodies. Thought provoking and edgy, music to drive by"
4,Keep on Jivin',"I wrote a review awhile back on the band even though I'd only heard one song. Since then I've heard some more of their music, and I'm even more impressed. Their blues harmonica comes out especially well in ""Lucky"". I admit that their songs could use some more variation, but they've mastered the jive rythym and harmony. I'm surprised I haven't heard more about them."
3,Why I am not a C++ programmer,"Useful book, but consider the second example. Listing 2.5a: Spec() constructor in wrong place (causes multiple definition errors as is; move inside the struct) Listing 2.5b: needs #include <strstream.h>; references to npos should be string::npos. Listing 2.6: AVvector should be ValueExtractor::AVvector, AVmap should be ValueExtractor::AVmap. I thought this code was supposed to have been tested? When you finally fix it and compile it, you find C++ STL version: 128(text)+40(data)k, 33.2(usr)+11.0(sys)sec Plain C version: 8(text)+ 8(data)k, 7.2(usr)+ 0.8(sys)sec The plain C code is shorter and considerably simpler than listing 2.6, and runs 5.5 times faster (Alpha/OSF, cc,cxx) when reading 100 000 copies of the sample data in the book. What's more, I had to try three C++ compilers before finding one that could handle the code at all.There are good things later in the book, but this was a very off-putting introduction."
3,Clarification,"I encountered the same problem as the customers before me. I bought it as a gift for someone....a pair means two! The photo as well depicted two and the trays. After receiving just one dumbbell I emailed amazon and they apologized and said that they would replace the order. Well, again I received one. So I emailed again and said that I would be more then happy to keep the two single in exchange for what was supposed to be a pair. They said that would be fine, but when my credit card bill arrived I was charged $149 twice! I currently have my credit card company disputing the charge. I have always had excellent service with Amazon in the past. This is the first time there has been a problem. I hope that Amazon takes these complaints into consideration and remedies the problem."
1,RIPPED OFF,"They're advertising a PAIR of dumbbells. ....you only receive one. After reading the review posted before me, I'm scared to complain to amazon."
3,Fun but hard.,"Standard side scrolling game, pretty fun to play and really hard difficulty. Not for the casual gamer, but if you love old games this is one to try."
3,"Good, but not great","I like this book for point location. Anatomical references are very good and I feel I can ""grok"" the point. I found the trigger point areas somewhat tedious, but liked the excellent anatomical references. For a ""visual person"" this one is great. It's a little thick though."
3,Color atlas of Acupuncture,I have not used the information in this book as of yet. I am waiting until I take a course on acupuncture. After looking through it promises to be useful
1,Not as expected,"Contrary to that suggested, if not indicated, this SNAA03 is not a titanium case or band watch. The finish apparently has titanium in it but this is a heavy case and band watch stated by Seiko and the case to be steel."
4,"Beautiful, but heavy","This is a beautiful watch which reminds me of the old Hamilton Pacer or Ventura. However this is a stainless steel watch plated with titanium oxide , so don't expect a light watch. This watch weighs in at a full 7 ounces, almost a half pound."
5,Essential for small group ministry,This book is an essential read for those planning to lead a chronic illness ministry. It helps you examine your motives and is full of suggestions for all phases of developing and implementing your ministry.
3,Some good information,"This book does give some new information and a fresh perspective of looking at leadership traits. Overall, however, the book lacks integration with enough examples and reads poorly. I would strongly recommend ""The Prime Movers"" also by Locke instead of this book."
5,"This is it, the whole enchilada","Lovingly restored, beautiful accompanying booklet, a great introduction to Bix. There are four such volumes, and I have acquired a second, and will continue to get all four. (There is a 5th, one-disc volume that has 3 Bix cuts and the rest are from other top flight groups of the day doing Bix like material). This material is hard to find in stores. I had no success in hunting down the excellent Jean Goldkette material, and here it all is. Enjoy."
5,Excellent Job of Cleaning Teeth and Gum Line,I (and my dentist and periodondist) love the way the Oral-B Dual Clean Brush Head cleans my teeth and all along the gum line. I've used this product for several years and intend to continue with it forever. Nothing beats this particular brush head. The dental hygienists are always pleased with the excellent condition of my teeth and gums. I thank the Oral-B Dual Clean Brush Heads for that.
3,"Average, nothing real special",I don't really see a difference between using this and just the regular brush head replacement. Probably won't be buying again... no need... will just be purchasing the regular brush head replacements.
3,Does not fit Pulsonic,"I bought these because in the description is lists the types of brushes it fits, and one of them is the Pulsonic. It turns out that it does not fit the Pulsonic. I did not try to return because someone in our family has a toothbrush that it does fit, but we still need brush heads for our Pulsonics."
3,Oral-b head replacement,"I've used your replacement heads in the past with no problem. But 1 of the replacement heads broke in only the second week I used it. Normally these are fairly reliable so I am not sure if it is the supplier or the product in general. I still like to order my supplies from your source but if this continues, I may have to stop ordering."
4,"Tight fit, but works.","I had to jam the head onto my toothbrush (An Oral B Pro-Health Dual Clean battery powered toothbrush) whereas the original was much easier. But, it works! And is much cheaper than $9 per head at the grocery store."
5,Powerful,"This is a really useful head for any of the toothbrushes it fits. I've tried a good portion of the other ones that Oral-B offers, but this is by far the best. I have noticed a significant difference in how clean my teeth are after brushing with this head and the others, this being far better. Also, provided you don't brush too hard, the bristles last longer than the other heads."
5,nice toothbrush head,This toothbrush head works wonders and feels really good on your teeth. I wish they lasted longer and were nto as expensive.
5,granny,I had been looking for these for awhile now and when I found them here did not expect them to be the right ones. Excuse the capitals.THESE ARE GREAT FITS MY BRUSH AND EVERYTHING.
2,Not soft,"I used these for my oral electric toothbrush for over 2 years. However, I recently stopped because my dentist noticed gum recession (not good) and mentioned that a lot of electric toothbrushes don't have soft bristles. These feel noticeably more hard/firm that my soft manual toothbrush, and I regret not being smarter about switching over to electric."
2,Not for us...,"Way too big!! Bought these when we ""upgraded"" to Oral-B from Sonicare and thought we would really like them since they are the same style of heads that we have been using for years. These are almost twice as big as the sonicare kind. We're sticking to the original Oral-B ones."
3,Oral B tooth brushes,"I find the brushes are a little hard and the brissles are sort of permenantly seperated. I did not see an expiration date nor whether the brush was hard or soft on the package. Maybe it doesn't expire nor come in anything other than soft. However, delivery time was good."
5,Great price free shipping,This is the way to go for stuff like this. Saves me money with free shipping. Amazon has it together. Item arrives every six months automatically but can change delivery sooner very easy.
4,Problem but No,"I bought this first anticipating the Oral B Advancedpower 950TX would work,of which was writen about/reviewed.hopefully I can remedy the brush situation But have absolutly No problem with the replacements still in the package they came in. They Do sound like Winners to me.Hopeful"
2,Eleanor,"I had a Oral-B sonic vitality before and I think it is worth the extra money to buy it again. The duel clean gets dirty in between the two brush heads. I'm already on my second head and it is getting dirty too. I think it cleans OK, but probably will replace it soon."
4,super clean... best ever,this is a great item to pair my new brush now I can reach the more tough spot.
4,OK,IT WAS AN OK TOOTH BRUSH BUT THE ORIGINAL SINGLE SPINNING HEAD CLEANER SEEMED TO DO A BETTER JOB.
3,Whoops!,Items didn't fit my product. Some problems with return/refund. Merchant finally made things right. Bottom Line- Buy stuff like this in a physical store.
4,Love the larger coverage,These work well with my electric toothbrush. I prefer a full-size head and this provides what I need. I only wish it cost less per unit.
5,Perfect,"Arrived on time, and everything in order. Purchased 2 packs of 3 heads. price is good and very happy with product."
3,OVER PRICED,"LIKE THE 3 PACK THEY ARE WAY OVER PRICED, BUT THAT IS NORMAL BUT THEY ARE GOOD ALL BRUSES ARE OVER PRICED"
3,Good but needs a better design,"I like the Oral B electric tooth brush and these heads are very good when they are new. However, and I hope that someone from Braun reads this, the design needs improvement. The smaller of the two brushes separates from the back long before the brush is worn out. If you continue to use the brush it can catch your cheek and be a little painful. This could be a purposeful design as it means you have to replace the brush before it is actually worn out."
3,Oral B replacement review,The replacement heads fit my Brawn electric tooth brush and work ok but I think I prefer just the round replacement head - they seem to clean more thoroughly. Maybe that's because these larger heads feel softer than the original round heads.
4,"big, messy","This brush is about twice the size of the standard brush head. I feel like I can have a more efficient brush with these, when compared to the smaller heads. If you have a smaller mouth, you might want to just try the single pack first.Cons: It feels too big at first.Its messier."
4,Good product and service,"As far as I can tell, these brushes are Oral-B made, they work well and were available at a very reasonable price. Service was fine; received them in relatively short time."
4,Oral B replacement heads,I have had lots of problems finding replacement heads for our Oral B electric toothbrushes. They were either out of stock or way over priced. Amazon has made life much better by having these heads at an excellent price and the quick and correct shipping made this slightly stressful purchase very easy.
3,seem to wear out sooner,Seems like these replacement head wear out sooner than the one's that come with the brush. I did not time them exactly. just an approximation.. But other than that they work fine.
4,Good for people with big mouths,"This is the tip that should be included with electric toothbrushes. It is good for people with big mouths (like me!). It covers much more area per second of brushing time, although it makes it more difficult to get behind the last teeth on each row.For what these brushes are, they are very expensive, although Amazon's price was pretty good."
2,Unless U have a big mouth like my wife......,"Just kidding honey. Seriously though, the head of this is quite large and it feels uncomfortable while brushing. I'm been using this for a month now and still haven't got used to the size. When these wear out, I'm think I'll switch back to the smaller brush."
2,Tooth brush refills,This brush is supposed to be like a brush and flosses too. Did not like it as it was too rough. Have gone back to regular brush so would not order again but would order regular brushes again.
4,Works,I ordered these previously through Amazon as the dual-action re-fills are hard to find in stores and are more expensive. It's an Oral-B product so there was no doubt the would fit.
4,Oral-B Replacement Head 3 Pack - Dual Clean Electric ToothBrush Head,"Received correct product in time stated.Much easier shopping on line, many stores didnot have this product. Buy enough 3 packs andshipping is free.A good deal"
2,Poor qualitry,I have used Oral B electric toothbrushes for years. Loved them. Never found one as poor quality as this. Would not reorder this item. Would just go to local retailer and purchase in future.
5,Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head - 3 ct.,The Oral B Dueal Clean Replacment Brush Heads fit my Oral-B Vitality Braum Brush Holder exactly. It comes with color coded collars that slip over the stem of the brush to designate the brush head if others utilize the same brush holder. The dual action of circular cleaning as well as the up and down movement does a through job of cleaning.
4,Convenience and good price,"The main reason I order this from Amazon is for convenience. When I started using a power toothbrush, I visited several retailers and could not find these or they were out of stock. Very frustrating. Also, the 3-pak option is very convenient and saves money."
4,Works great,My wife and I both have used these replacement heads and haven't had any problems with them. Can't beat the price locally and they shipped fast too with prime!
5,great product,This brush head seems to do a more thorough job at cleaning than the regular smaller ones. I highly recommend it!
4,Great - but not quite as intrusive as I was expecting,"For the 2 other people throughout history who glance at this review and are also 6'7"" and have reasonably proportioned body parts: this brush head isn't that big. It's not overwhelming, nor (assuming you do a reasonable, dentist-sanctioned brush job normally in life) is it going to overwhelm you with bristling action. It does feel nice. It doesn't feel big or bulky. Imagine it this way (assuming you're using the regular Oral-B brush heads currently, the similar ones with just the top circular component): it's like the same motion, with the form factor of a regular (non-mechanical) manual toothbrush. Voila, that's what it's like. Good product, but nothing revolutionary or invasively large about it like part of me was kind of expecting after reading the reviews here."
2,"Cleans Great, Possibly Dangerous","These brush heads arguably clean better than the other Oral-B brush options. They felt large at first, but I got used to it.I've only purchased these once, but all three ""Dual Clean"" brush heads in the pack fell apart after about 3-weeks of use. The lower part of the brush becomes loose and ""catches"" on your gum/tongue while brushing. This is painful and has caused me to bleed.I purchased these from Amazon and they look legit. So, I'm not sure if these were defective or if it's a problem with the brush design. From what I can tell, there are a few other reviews that mention this issue."
3,I Still Prefered Interplak,"I hate any brush that vibrates but that being said, we're stuck now with only the sonic or vibrating styles now anyway so this worked the best out of all of those kinds."
5,Dual Clean,"Hard to find locally. The price beats the locals hands down. A great replacement head. Get that ""just left the dentist feel every time you brush!"
5,Great bigger head,I prefer the bigger/double brush head with the electric toothbrush. It makes me feel like I'm getting a better brush.
4,"Impressed, BUT","The head is long, so it is hard to get more than one of the two heads into flat contact with the teeth at the same time.Except to the molars, my jaw is curved, as I assume most are. I had to develop an arm movement that would first put one of the heads against my teeth and then pivot the angle of my hand into my mouth to get the second head into contact with the same teeth.The head closest to the hand can NOT be used on the back molars, at least not in my mouth.It is a great idea, but needs to have the lower head (closest to the hand) kind of float."
1,PLEASE NOTE: Will NOT work with Sonic Complete.,"""Product Features"" info on this item is INCORRECT! While it says ""Fits all Oral B Power Toothbrushes except CrossAction Power."", it also does not work with Sonic Complete. There may be other models it doesn't fit as well so I suggest researching this further BEFORE buying.Do note however that the return process was VERY EASY, VERY QUICK & PAINLESS!"
3,They are ok I guess,They didn't fit my base eventhough they said they would. Just know it may or may not fit. Be ready to see if you can return. I just tossed mine.
4,Great but too expensive,"I really like my electric tooth brush, and these re-fills do the job, but I brush a lot, so I have to keep buying them, and I feel the cost is high. Other then that very good."
3,I doubt the quality,"I have not used that yet, but the quality of wrap is not as good as the items sold in stores, so I also doubt the quality of the brush."
5,Just keeps getting better,Even better than the first season. The stories were really interesting and Brenda Blethyn is terrific. As soon as I finished it I was pining for a third season and was so glad to see it's in production.
3,A bit repetitious in parts.,"Although a bit repetitious in parts it did have good story lines,bit I don't know if I would purchase another season of it or not."
5,buy this pbs shoe it's a must for murder lovers,"the Inspector is a women, love it already , she has a partner and a team, all seem real no one is american tv perfect, that's why i love english shows, people don't have to be beautiful to be smart or clever, how may people look like models in their jobs?"
5,Good counterbalance between characters,The detectives off set each other in a pleasant way. The non personal solo life of one and the personal family life of the other. They seem to have a good understanding and respect of each other.
1,Dont buy this !!!!,i bought this after hearing the remix on the radio over and over on ENERGY 97. Now i get it and find out the remix being played on the radio isnt even on this LP. whats on the LP is lame..WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!.
1,Was this girl drunk when she recorded this pile of crap???,"While mildly melodic, this song is so bad it's laughable!!! The lyrics are so bad they're funny and singing are just terrible. Seriously, it sounds more like a drunken rant rather than a song.Maybe in 10 years, people who are drunk will sing along to this at a karaoke bar for some kicks cause it is so awful, but as for musical credibility... Well, I'm not even sure if something this crappy can be considered music."
3,good not great,"one reviewer claims this is better then other r&b totally oblivious to the fact that this song is written in a hiphop influence from the lyrics to how she sings it, only true fans of music would recognize this influence. Other than that it is just another in many good songs outhere that made it to the public attention, Natasha can definitely sing though, but she's getting more credit than she deserves."
1,"Hey, Natasha, You're A No-Talent Corporate Pawn","""I LOVE YOU. IS THAT OK?!"" Ohmigawd, give me a break. This girl manages to utter ""I Love You? so many times it loses all meaning. I HATE THE VIDEO MORE. She's followed around town by drawn in boomboxes, but you know and they know they were airbrushed little people chopped off at the knees who don't even get the credit for showing up. DO NOT BUY THIS SINGLE OR THE INEVITABLY CRAPPY ALBUM THAT WILL BE SURE TO FOLLOW!!!!"
2,Works. . .Sorta,"Received some of the HD broadcasts in my area. After making some ""very"" minor adjustments, one of the antennas just fell off. because I cannot speak for the true amount of RF broadcast I am getting in my area, I cannot say how well the unit does. I can say that I only get about three of the 8 or 9 HD channels in my area. If looking at this model to purchase, do some more homework before settling on this one. There are much better manufactured models out there than this one."
1,Couldn't pick up any reliable signal,"I live only a few miles from a repeater tower and this antenna couldn't pick up any local channel at all. The channels it did pick up were really low signal. The antenna that came with my other TV picks up all local channels just fine and in HD in perfect quality. Not sure why this antenna failed so badly, but just a fair warning to anyone out there thinking of it."
2,This is a short version of Modesitt's book The Timegod.,"The Timegod contains this entire book, but is about 200pages longer. It is enjoyable."
4,Worth a read.,"Time travellers and norse mythology, but not on Earth. Main character is power in search of a goal. Fast paced and well written. Fans of Modesitt will enjoy it immensly"
5,my favorite children's book,"I adore this book. With wonderfully subtle grace, the author teaches about friendship and, more importantly, the personality differences of friends -without judgement. The free spirited child is admired but the shy, timid child also prevails. An exceptional choice for a ""second child"" who may be overshadowed by the ""perfect"" sibling."
1,disappointed,"I expected more imagination. Anna doesn't do anything extraordinary. She doesn't seem like a good friend either. She expects the boy to follow her, and then she's always saying ""Bye!."" Anna doesn't TEACH her friend to be brave; she leaves him and he finds his own courage."
2,a little strange,"I bought this book because I thought my older daughter could read it to my younger daughter, Anna, whom we call Anna Banana. The story is a little strange and the pictures aren't very ""kid friendly"". There is a part in the book about a monster with big hands that's chasing the little boy and I think it was the cause of a nightmare that night!"
5,"Walt Disney's Epcot, Creating the New World of Tomorrow (1982)","I have had this book for many years. It remains on my bookshelf where I can pick it up anytime. I often look through it before heading to Orlando as it is such a wonderful reminder of Walt's ideas, concepts and vision - which he unfortunately never got to see. Of the many picture books available about Disney's resorts and parks, this is one of the best. The hundreds of photos and drawings show the many ideas that helped shape this park - some that were abandoned and others that are still there as originally conceived. Those that have followed the growth and success of Disney, like myself since early childhood, will truly enjoy this edition."
1,Does not work on XP,"If I could give this product 0 stars I would.I used the Virtual flpooy mode first and copied it to my new maxtor 60 Gig hard drive, when done it wouldn't boot up. So then I tried the create program disk mode and again it said that the operation was a sucess. Tried to boot up, nothing but errors. After about 3 hours of wasting my time and money I had to re-install windows Xp from scratch. The drive utility that came with the Maxtor Hard Drive was more useful than this over priced [item]. Maybe it does work in Windows 98 or Me which allows you to run in DOS but not in XP. Powerquest has no updates for this product."
1,Buyer Beware,"I tried to use this software to upgrage from a 10 gigabyte hard drive to a 40 gigabyte hard drive, a common enough task. The program took about 3 hours to perform the cloning. However, I never could get the new disk to work. I spend days on this. The powerquest web site offers very little help. I finally gave up and bought Norton Ghost. It performed the cloning in 11 minutes! And, the new disk worked perfectly. I now have 30 gigabytes of free disk space and I didn't have to reinstall my operating system and my software. My advice: forget Powerquest software unless you want to waste your time."
4,khaki mac sports chiar,"Chair made of durable material. Suggest that short-legged persons do not use - would be uncomfortable if feet don't touch ground when sitting in chair (support bar underneath legs will cut off circulation).When I received this chair the vinyl on back of chair was scarred or scratched.The Carry bag had unraveling seams upon arrival.Chair very comfy for taller individuals, but feels like it could be damaged if weight limit is exceeded (250 lbs)."
2,Not Aquinas,"John Finnis's latest book is not really about Aquinas. It is, rather, an attempt to supply a Thomistic pedigree for the 'New Natural Law Theory' developed by Finnis in his earlier books and articles. This is the upshot of recent reviews in THE THOMIST (April 2001 issue) and The American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly (Winter 2001 issue). If you are interested in the thought of John Finnis, this book may interest you. If you want to understand Aquinas, look elsewhere."
3,Mixed feelings abound...,"I found myself incredibly annoyed by the character of Emma Bovary. Although, the story itself was written with flowery and descriptive flare, I think that Flaubert wrote Emma so well that by the time I was halfway into the book I was ready for her to just kill herself already. I trudged my way through the middle of this book only because I felt invested in it already. I didn't feel any empathy for her character. The story was very well written. A fan of Flaubert's, but I was definitely not a fan of Emma's."
1,"""Mistress of Atlantis"" - This Video Version is a Definite Miss!","Do not waste your money on this Alpha Video version: The transfer is so bad that the only equivalent I have seen is an equally bad transfer of ""Love From a Stranger"", another movie which has been done a major disservice by a bad transfer.I would like to think that some more discerning studio will take pity on the general public and release good versions of these movies, as I feel they both deserve a wider viewing by the general public. However, the current versions for sale of ""Mistress"" and ""Stranger"" are a nighmare to view and take totally away from the actors and plot line."
3,Very Good Reading,"I just finished reading this book. It is thoughtfully researched, and very well written. This young lady knows her material on the Holocaust. My only comments regarding this book is the outrageous price tag attached to it. Otherwise, a very good book."
2,You can't have it all ...,"I wrote a review before, but it seems to be lost.Now that I have the S3 for some time more, it makes anyway sense to update it. The S3 is neat because of its size. What is not nice is that the camera is unusable in low light. The flash works at most 8 feet and tends to badly overexpose on a normal setting. Resetting the camera sensitivity for the flash is not acceptable. As the flash, as the battery suffers from the small size. Not very usable. Where the S3 was practically unusable, the Sony DSC-S85 made perfect pictures with and without flash."
1,Not worth the trouble...,"I bought this camera and loved it at first but after a couple of months it began to have problems. The first problem was that it just stopped charging the battery. I sent it in for service and it now charges but freezes up all of the time, I have sent it in three more times at my expense and the problem has not been corrected. The last time they blamed it on the battery but I have two and even with a fully charged battery the problem persists. I for one will never buy another Kyocera product and would recommend that you consider a different brand also."
3,Value for Money,"Size is the major advantage of this camera but it has 3 major problems: 1) battery is not powerful enough that it cannot last for a whole day; a spare battery is a MUST; 2) Flash photo is very bad (& drains your already weak battery) making over-exposure unavoidable; 3) Auto focus is slow, particularly in dim environment.Other than these, this small camera is packed with a lot of useful functions such as ISO adjustment, manual white balance, manual focus, aperature adjustment and the even digital zoom is very good (compared to other digital cameras whose digital zoom are nearly useless given their poor quality).Finally, in HK, this camera is sold at around US$385, making it one of the cheapest 3m pixel digital cameras in the market."
2,well researched but very dry,"I read this book in order toi write a book report about it for my AP history class. the book guves a very deatiled account of the brief life of the Free Soil party. I would say this book is long on evidence and short on conclusions. The author does a poor job of outlining main points or making them easy to grasp, so the main ideas tend to get lost in a sea of names and dates. Nonetheless, this book was painstakingly researched, and i liked thew way the author quoted liberally from newspaper articles and editorials of the time."
4,School Book,"If you need this book for school, get it, but if not then don't bother spending so much for information you can get cheaper."
3,"Not the worst, but aggravating at times","I used this book for a three semester Calculus regimen. At times, during Calc I, I wanted to throw it out the window; the material was sometimes presented in poor order (related rates introduced before implicit differentiation -- talk about confusing?!) and important concepts were even introduced in the homework sections. I survived the class, though, and found the rest of the book much more helpful for Calc II and III. On the whole, it was a pretty good book.The book does contain a few errors and misprints which is something I find almost unforgivable for an 8th edition textbook. Furthermore, the solutions manual often skipped far too many steps.Finally, I continue to find the book a helpful reference when I need a refresher, and have grown to like it more as time passes. I'd still recommend a Larson text over this one, though."
3,A good read!,"Young Slasher's huntress mother, Kr'ra'klv'tt (Sun and Shadow) believed her son would be special. With that belief the huntress requests of Broken Spear, the great warrior of the Rydderrak Clan, that he teach Slasher the Hunt Law and Code of Honor. The warrior agrees to teach Slasher ""whatever he can learn."" And while Slasher learns, Broken Spear studies him and eventually he earns his new name: Renegade.Renegade and his two friends are taught all they must know to protect their people from all and anything that would threaten them. But the last test of the Hunt Law is the most important and must be performed alone. Renegade must, at risk of his own death, face the Master Hunt. Will he succeed? Is there someone who would stand in his way?Armchair Interviews says: Renegade The Hunter is a unique, creative and interesting adventure that is a combination of the primitive and the high tech. If you enjoy Science Fiction/Fantasy, you will thoroughly enjoy this book."
3,All Seating Plans Should Be Readable,Some of the seating plans are not readable because the print is very small. It would have been better if larger venues were printed on two pages to be able to read the seat numbers. Otherwise it is very comprehensive.
2,Entertaining but not especially useful,"I agree that Svejda tends to hyperbolize. Things are usually black or white with him, with negative comments clearly his forte. He relishes the chance to use vitriol and overly-cute anecdotes. Reading the negative comments is like watching a child throw a tantrum so in a way the book gives a certain perverse pleasure. Other reviewers are more timely, more accurate, and less likely to let personal opinions of the artists affect their reviews. If you want a more comprehensive guide, the Penguin Guide will do the trick. It is plain-written and reviews many recordings of a given work whereas Svejda usually lists just one or two recordings, i.e., his favorite."
2,"outdated, biased","The author's view is outdated as well as the book itself. He overestimates Reiner too much, and the fact that he grew up in Chicago listening to Reiner's concerts makes the bias more evident. Overall, he is too biased towards American orchestras and old recordings."
1,"Way too biased, but somewhat entertaining","I think Svejda is a great salesman, but beyond that there is little, if nothing, that shows me that he knows much about music beyond his own narrow personal favorites which are questionable at best.Give him credit for being a great con man though"
5,Hidden Gem of a Movie,"""Four Sheets to the Wind"" premiered at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival in 2007 where it was greeted with a standing ovation. Though not commercial fare, the film is one of the best surprises of the year. Cody Lightning stars as a young native american who decided to leave his Oklahoma reservation for city life in Tulsa. There he meets up with his troubled sister. The relationship between the two is at the heart of this beautiful film. The lead performances are near perfect and was singled out for recognition during the festival awards ceremony. Don't miss this inspiring and dramatic story!"
1,Dissapointed,"This movie had a great promo, but did not deliver what it promised. It did not successfully get to the point, although it tried for way too long."
2,Not Very Creative,"What an incredible disappointment!! I have to agree with the point of view of one other reader...this book has absolutely nothing new to tell anyone about organizing... the writers try to pretend there is a different spin to their method, but it just ain't true! I read the book hoping that someone would give me some refreshing ideas that would enable me to throw away my daytimer forever. Imagine my suprise when we get down to the nitty-gritty and up pops the picture of a daytimer-type organizer page, as well as other materials taught at Franklin Covey seminars!! Hey, if that had worked I would not have picked up this book! Bottom line I got from the book: creative people have to learn to stop and focus some of the time. Consider yourself right-brained in a left-brained world and do the best you can. There is nothing new under the sun!"
4,What an eye opener!,"I recommend this book to anyone who will listen. As a Professional Organizer, I provide trainings and workshops to help individuals deal with their organizing challenges. This book helps you see that there isn't a 'right' or 'wrong' way to organize...it's what fits YOUR style. This is more times than not a relief to people who thought they were doing it 'wrong'. Thanks for this wonderful information!"
1,Too cutesy for my taste,"I found this book too cutesy for my taste, with its focus on ""Arbies"" (Right-Brainers) and ""Elbies"" (Left-Brainers). The authors reiterate many of Stephen Covey's concepts from ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."" Overall, however, there is too much emphasis on psychoanalyzing, labeling, justifying, and excuse-making, rather than practical suggestions and approaches, although you will find a few common-sense ideas sprinkled in between the extensive simplistic discussions of ""Arbies"" versus ""Elbies."""
1,Don't buy the tape alone,"I own the paperback edition of this title and found parts of it helpful enough to want the audiotape to renew my motivation and reinforce the ideas. I am very disappointed in how short the tape is. So much has been cut from the book that I think it'd be almost worthless to get the tape on its own. The tape is missing most of the text that got me excited about the book, so it's not much good for getting me fired up to get organized."
5,Enlightening Your Load,"This book summarizes right brain (creative) organization skills in contrast to organization skills for left brain (logical). People use both sides of the brain actively, but very often one side is dominant in each of us. The author suggests great strategies that align with right brain strengths. I am a follower of David Allen's GTD (Getting Things Done), and I found this book to be a complementary philosophy. Organize your stuff, your time, your life in order to free up your mind and your energy for all those productive and creative pursuits you've been intending to get to. Is this book for you? Pop quiz - your toothpaste tube is an indicator - right brains crinkle up the tube and may not replace the top. Left brains methodically roll the tube from the bottom."""
3,"Loved this book, until I lost it in the clutter","I got this book years ago and learned a lot from the first chapter, which I read before I lost the book somewhere in the clutter. I think this is where I learned that you should clean rather than look for something, because when you're looking, you think it's a yellow piece of paper, but when you're cleaning, you look at every single thing, so will find it, even though the piece of paper was really pink.Even with that skill, though, I have never found my copy of the book, nor the second one that I bought to replace the first, and then, ahem, promptly lost.It's been a few years and two kids, one blessed with my organizational skills, poor duck. Maybe it's time to buy another copy. The three stars is the fairest review I can give, having only read the first chapter. Perhaps I will rate the book far higher when I am able to finish reading it. As they say, third time is the charm."
4,Tough to sum up resolve this book offers 4 the creative ind.,This book lets you know how many talents you really are denying yourself due to guilt feelings of disorganization.
2,Creative Person's Guide Not So Creative,"I guess I had my hopes up too high for this book because of the previous reviews I read on Amazon's web site. I had hoped this book would reveal something about organization that could give me a fresh take on it and make it a fun, creative process...some new perspective that might make cleaning interesting and even enjoyable. Not so. The introductory psychological information was overly simplistic and overgeneralized. The ""organizational plans"" were typical and nothing new. I've read many other books with ""organizing"" themes, and this one told me nothing I didn't already know. If you want a simplistic, stereotypical view of ""right-brainers"" and organizing, get this book. If you want to read a better book about organizing that doesn't contain shallow psycho-pop, buy a Don Aslett or Clean Team book."
4,this tape is a tremendous help,"This tape gives you solid, realistic and workable methods to easing yourself into the habit of being organized. It really helped me get motivated to do all the stuff I hate to do."
5,Best story of mismatched lovers! Dalton is awesome.,"Once again, I am in awe of the strength of Timothy Dalton. His portrayal of a king with an obsession for a married woman is heartbreaking. He is at once frightening and forceful and tender and vulnerable. Not many actors could pull that off. I waited a long time to get the DVD and although it may have shortcomings as others have noted (cuts in the film, no subtitles), it is still going to be one of my favorites."
5,Absolute best sword fight ever filmed in Hollywood!!!,The choice of actors that could have been found to play this role of smoldering passion and the best sword fight that could be depicted without real blood...is of course ONLY Timothy Dalton...where have all our real men gone on the screen??? Faded in to political correctness perhaps???? Enjoy..try to find the longer version to really SEE the story better!!!!
3,ak-47 scope mount with scope and bipod,"scope mount took some grinding here and there to fit my wasr-10.still not a very good fit,as for the scope and bipod, looks mean on my ak.the kit came without instructions or tips on how to get receiver mount to fit."
4,Contents of this compilation...,"This CD is a compilation of alternate versions of the songs performed by DeVotchKa on the motion picture soundtrack. They include:1. How it Ends2. Enemy Guns, performed live in Paris3. You Love Me4. We're Gonna Make It5. Do You Think There's a Heaven?"
3,Good,When I received it I was very excited. When I listened to it I realized it does not have any words in the songs. Kind of bummed out but I still thought the cd was okay :)
1,Flimsy construction,"I liked the unique design of this birdbath, but was very disappointed when it arrived. The finish on the copper was uneven and bumpy. Even worse, the birdbath is constructed of extremely lightweight materials making it impossible to fill with water and not have it tip over on anything but the most level surface. I wouldn't advise this as a purchase for anyone's garden space where it is to rest on grass, soil or rocks. It would also be a poor choice for use around curious kids who could easily tip it over."
1,This was a Huge disappointment,"I ordered this bird bath and have sent it back. ... Mine arrived looking similar to the picture, but the paint was a really funky mahogany color and it had plastic dragonflies in the cat-tails of the base. I have seen this item in person elsewhere and it was really nice. I don't know what exactly what happened here, but it wasn't good."
2,Not what I was expecting,"The picture really made me want to buy this product. However, when the item came it wasn't what I was expecting. The copper bath did not look like a bright/shiny copper, it was a strange non-copper color and the feel was not smooth but gritty. Is this good for birds? I also can't tell if it is real copper, copper plated, or just copper colored?I also received mine with plastic dragon flies which look really lame, but the picture did not have these either.Is there a difference between product number OP-25130 and OP-25130-1? Mine has the ""-1"" after the main code. If anyone knows, or would like to share your product code, that would be greatly appreciated.I still haven't decided if I am keeping it or sending it back."
4,Withstands the ravages of nature,"Despite what another reviewer has said about this product it is built to last. It has withstood a windstorm with winds of over 65mph while planted in grass. And, the all copper construction is beautiful. A great gift for your favorite gardener at a reasonable price."
5,SC Hunter: Excellent read and extremeley informative. A must read.,"This book is a must read for any level bowhunter or any deer hunter for that matter, due to the large amount of information on deer behavior alone. The amount of dedicated deer hunting experience in this book is immeasurable. I look forward to implementing what I learned!"
2,Very Disappointing,"As the title indicates, I found this disappointing. I knew there wasn't going to be much in this book when the entire first chapter used charts and graphs to demonstrate that pressured bucks are harder to find!!!Also, he spent a good number of pages telling us how to approach landowners for permission to hunt! That is NOT what you buy a book like this for.He also presents a regimen for success that is so drastic I don't think many will follow thru. For example -- he prepares 80 different trees for stands.The book wasn't a total loss, as he does give a prioritized list of the 4 things to look for in the woods that are best places to find deer."
5,Best bowhunting book by far.,"This book is a must have for any serious bowhunter. If you are a novice bowhunter this book is a must read. For experienced bowhunters, this book will help you fine tune your hunting tactics.John covers the most important topics of bowhunting. Scent Control, Stand Placement, How to hunt Rublines, Scrapes and Staging areas, Using Decoys, Deer Recovery, and much more.Forget most of the articles you read in magazines or the hunting videos you see on television. This book will add 15 years of experience to your knowledge of bowhunting."
3,Not Quite As Advertised,"This Missal touts itself as being so easy to use but until you really get into the pattern of it, it isn't. I also have come to realize that the individual celebrant has a lot of flexibility in what readings, prefaces, etc. are used on any given day so unless your parish publishes a list for the week you can be very mislead. I highly recommend an online subscription (free) to Catholic Calendar. It helps a lot. I also agree with the other reviewer that the vinyl cover rolls and is flimsy."
1,Buyer Beware,"Unless you are ordering new direct from Amazon, you will likely get an old missal that you will not be able to use for the new mass. I have attempted to get a new missal and a revised NAB, instead I have out of date books that I can use to prop up a table with a bad leg."
3,OUTDATED,"Unfortunately the readings have been updated in recent years by the Church and therefore this and the other, blue, weekday Mass book are OUTDATED.I really hope that they will update their books, since it is easier to manage when the weekday Masses are separated into 2 books rather then one very large book."
5,An Excellent Book,"This is an excellent book for following the Mass. It is well written, easy to understand, and a blessing for those who like to read the gospels while saying their brievary prayers and before saying the rosary. No Catholic should be without it."
5,Help with sleep,I've had a lot of issues with sleep and take sleep medication but I stumbled on Ornithine mentioned on a website as being helpful for sleep and I tried it. It's allowed me to reduce the amount of medicine I take at night. I started with five pills and now take four a night.
2,As conspiracy goes it's OK.,"This book was OK as far as Conspiracy's go. But I felt like this book didn't have alot of content until the end. And the ideal that this book is based on has been done before, and it didn't have the places, and history that a book like The Da Vinci Code, and some others have had.I think that it's just really didn't have anything really original in it."
3,Not Quite Up to Par!,"When I read the back cover of this book by my fellow Atlantan, it appeared to be the formula that makes up my favorite type of book. Unfortunately, this did not hold true. Gregg Loomis has written a book featuring Lang Reily, an Atlanta attorney and former C.I.A. agent. When his sister and nephew are killed in France, Lang begins to try to find out why. When it appears that it has something to do with a painting his sister bought before her death, Lang begins to uncover the layers of a conspiracy that goes back thousands of years, all the while traveling throughout Europe.This is a backdrop that has served Dan Brown well, but Mr. Loomis' version does not move as fast or finish as well."
4,Great author,"Almost finished and I can't wait to read his next one. This one was published about the same time frame as ""DaVinci Code"" and has a similar theme but different enough to keep it interesting. I think this was the 1st book he wrote. I started with the 3rd one, Sinai Secret, and was hooked."
3,Classics 101,"For a better understanding of the inscription, its true meaning and its relevance to the painting, please check out this site for background informaton on the artist, Nicolas Poussin, and how he cleverly borrowed from classical poets.http://arcadia.ceid.upatras.gr/arkadia/engversion/culture/clasarcadia/etinarc.htmlI'm certainly not a Latinist, but it's the ""Sum"" that's the extra word as ""Ego"" is used here for emphasis and ""Sum"" (or ""am"") is assumed. No pun intended! The phrase actually has no verb. It's simply ""Et in Arcadia ego."" Replacing ""sum"" with ""ego"" gives it the punch it needs to convey the impact and terrible truth of what the shepherds have just encountered through the inscription. ""And even I [emphasis, here referring to Death/Mortality] too am in Arcadia."""
3,Not your DaVinci Code!,"I hate when a book has as its come-on ""just like the DaVinciCode."" I am always tempted to buy it because I loved that oneso much. And I am usually suckered in. This one was so-so. Itwas amazing that the main character has a name similar to DanBrown's (Langford Reilly - Robert Langdon) and that the coverhad the same subtle script as its background.Lang is searching for the killer of his sister and nephew.It leads to a Poussin painting procured by his sister. Thoseaffiliated with the painting are soon dead. His only clue isa polaroid of the original and it leads him throughout Europe.Knights Templar seem to be the culprits, but they date back 700 years. What is the answer?"
1,Incredibly bad,"This may well be one of the worst books ever. Totally unbelievable plot line, bad characters, bad dialog ... don't waste your time with this stinker."
2,Ugh,"I could only get through the first two chapters before I snorted with laughter. It just seems very anti-French, which is slightly amusing and terrible at the same time. Since I was amused, I gave it two stars instead of one. I knew this book was bad news when I first saw it in a grocery store, but I was tempted anyway. Oh well. Ugh."
5,A Wonderful Children's Edition!,"I received this book as gift when it was brand new in the 1960s. And still treasure it.A lovely picture book that won't tax early readers. A simplified ""reader's digest condensed version"" of a bible story for small children is on one page. The adjoining page has gorgeous and captivating full-page and full-color art illustrating each l-page story.It was my first Big Book! Perfect for 3rd grade and up. I still enjoy both the classic religious art and the stories :-)Note: This is a Catholic bible so may not suit fundamentalists whose beliefs require viewing the Bible as a literal and factual history book. Most others, whether Catholic or not, would probably find this an intelligent, moral and lovely little book for children."
3,The description is misleading.,Amazon's description of the product is MAC os 9 and below. This product is only for OS 8 and 9. It will not work on 7.5. Wish I had known this before I purchased it.
2,Strange movie,"Dan (Greg Harrison)gets kicked off the force for brutality, he's also suicidal and he wants to beat women during sex just like his father did with his mother. When he goes back to his home town he starts working at his deceased father's garage and falls in love again with his high school sweetheart Brenda, but he's afraid of intimacy with her because he will no doubt beat her so when Dr. Claire Archer comes into the picture as a radio host he turns to her for help and she decides to give it to him. She lets him reveal all of his desires and whilst in the process of trying to cure him she gets obsessed with him, which later on turn out to be Dan's downfall when he tries to back out on her. Doctor/patient relationship oversteps boundaries, nudity is limited yes Greg flaunts his naked butt in this a few times, but the ending was bad even though the plot started off good. I don't intend to see the other sequels to this movie no thank you!"
5,Fabulous Cheese,"I heard about this guy in December. I loved the idea of covering main stream songs in the lounge style. I went with this album first because it had samples online and I could get a feel for his work.I'll probably buy about 10 copies of this and have them shipped to various friends. I have hangups about burning CDs and giving them away. Illegal, doncha know.This whole album is fun. Great to shake up some martinis with friends that have some humor.I'm sure I'll buy the rest of his albums for myself. I doubt I'll review them. With Richard Cheese, it is the artist that should be reviewed instead of the album. If you like him, I suspect you'll like every album.If you don't like him, stay out of my gin."
4,Super Cynicism,Richard Cheese's sarcastic rendition of these well-known songs will make you laugh; even more if you are a fan of the bands who wrote them.
5,Uplifting and inspiring compositions,"From the first time I heard Lux Aeterna on the radio, it captured my heart and soul. As a performer I had the pleasure to play the piece several times in concert and see the impact on the audience who usually walks out of the hall when a contemporary composer gets performed. It gives me great joy to see a ""modern"" composition reaching out to the people.. The recording engineers have done a marvellous job in bringing across the dynamics and colors of the piece. A gem in my collection."
3,"Beautiful music, average performance","All music by Lauridsen, good orchestra, nice choral blend in the choir, heavy handing singing, choral phrasing is not determined by the text, had greater potential with influence of composer."
5,"Listen to the ""roses""","Everybody talks about the Lux Aeterna and O Magnum, but not too many people have had the pleasure of singing the entire ""Les Chansons Des Roses"" set. I did in college and once since, and the simple beauty of the set based on poems by Rilke is captivating both to the singer and the listener. The challenge of singing four movements acapella and striving to be in tune at the end of the fourth movement while the piano joins the choir cholding the last chord to segue into the fifth is infuriating, but sublime. This is a great recording, I guess only Lauridsen and the people in the recording session know about how many takes it took to get it right..."
3,Not bad,"I picked this cd up because it looked interesting and the composer was from Eastern Washington. [Well if you were raised in Eastern Washington you'd understand that is reason enough]. Reading the reviews I expected O Magnum Mysterium to be excellent. In fact, Ave Maria is the piece I find most interesting, because at points it shares a common aesthetic with Biebl's Ave Maria. Beyond that I found the cd to be interesting music that fades quickly into the background - lush, soothing, and forgetable.Lauridsen is good at taking advantage of the best of choral sounds ... the music simply lacks originality."
3,"Beautiful music, a muddy sound, likely due to venue","A very muddy, reverb sound here. Check out the Polyphony recording on Hyperion. The choir was likely smaller than the LA Master Choir."
5,The Most Sublime Music You Will Ever Hear,"I heard selections from this album while listening to the radio on my birthday, and absolutely fell in love with it. Unfortunately we were in the car at the time, and I could not write down any information. Months later my husband found it here on Amazon and gave it to me as an anniversary present. I can't express how much it meant to me, especially since the selections I heard were from ""Les Chansons de Roses."" We had used roses as the theme for our wedding, and now this sublime, angelic music will always remind me of the love my husband and I share. This is a perfect CD to share with someone you love."
3,"Repetition, dear Morten, is the key to poetry - not melody!","I would love to say that this is the ""most uplifting...harmonious...blah, blah, blah...""that I have ever heard. But sadly, it is not. At the ACDA convention this year at Loyola Marymount U, I was granted the extreme privilege of performing in the same concert session as the LAMC, at which Lauridsen himself was present (I was singing with the Thomas Downey Knightengales), and truthfully, I was not impressed by the barrage of Lauridsen pieces. I had previously heard the ""Dirait-on"" and ""O Magnum,"" and while I love those pieces - I love them separately. Lauridsen's work really does meld into itself after a while. The melodies, while soothing, are also coma-inducing. The repetition of melodic passages gets very monotonous - especially after one has just gone through a rigorous performance. This is not to say that Lauridsen is a bad composer - I like his work, if only in small doses!"
5,Glorious music from an American master,"Morten Lauridsen's music is glorious and ethereal -- music to get lost in. His complex harmonies provide a fabric of sound that carry you away, and his ability to use voice as an orchestral instrument is unmatched among modern composers. The Los Angeles Master Chorale, for which the Lux Aeterna suite was composed and dedicated, does a marvelous job of rendering this fabric with all the color and richness it deserves. I'm especially fond of the Agnus Dei in track 5. I bought the CD specifically for O Magnum Mysterium, but I am pleased to find that I enjoy virtually every track.In fact, it is dangerous for me to play this at work, because I have a tendency to stop what I'm doing and get involved in the music.My only gripe is that several of the tracks are very, very, very quiet. I understand that the pieces are supposed to be soft, but the Lux Aeterna Introitus in track 1 and O Magnum Mysterium in track 17 seem unreasonably so."
5,"""O Nata Lux"" has a place in my heart","My choir at Free State High School in Kansas sang ""O Nata Lux"" my junior year, and every time we sang it I got chills. For the concert we were lined up along the sides of the auditorium (guys on one side girls on the other) and wow was it amazing, and we even got a standing ovation for it. Lauridsen is amazing for writing something that beautiful and I found it to be an honor to be able to sing that song. It was one of my favorite songs we sang all year...next to ""Sleep"" from Eric Whitacre...equally amazing."
1,Horrible,I ordered 3 bathing suits on August 16th two of the suits the merchants were Newport News I never recieved them. I finally emailed them on September 15th and now they claimed that they were delivered back to them marked undeliverable. The other bathing suit I recieved 5 days after my order and it was great... I will never order anything that comes from Newport news again!!! As my overall experience through Amazon though I think they are GREAT!!!
3,This stuff was...,This stuff was a pain to squeeze out of tube and it didn't seem to work. Used on my guinea pig.
5,little bit for little cavies,"I discovered mites on our two female cavies who are over 2 years of age. One had scratched and developed a big bald spot on top of her back. I called around for vets the next one was not available for another 4 days. After reading the reviews and online research I express ordered this paste, arrived in 2 days. I applied a size of pea behind each ear on both animals every 7 days for four weeks. Within 3 days they were scratching a lot... less, we cleaned the cage after every dose, wore gloves and practiced common sense precautions.Now I am happy to see zero bald spots happy perky cavies. I paid $17 for this paste including shipping. One trip to vet was $70 plus $20 for meds. I want to thank the previous viewers for helping me and others in similar situation."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this program but it never successfully installed. I had a friend that works on computers try to install it but with limited success. I needed another disk and was referred to the website but this edition is no longer available - and neither is the tech support. The company advised that this was an ""as is"" product - so I've learned my lesson with buying old software."
5,Great replacement flap!,"We have 3 dogs so the dog door gets used constantly. I've replaced the dog door twice (in 2 years) because the flap falls off. Then we got a replacement flap (which we should have done to begin with instead of replacing the entire door). Now I'm going to keep a couple of these on hand for future. We had purchased the dog door at Lowe's but they don't carry the replacement flaps. Installation was easy.PetSafe Easy Fit Replacement Flap, Medium"
4,Pet door review,Replacement is almsot perfect. However the original flap had clear plastic so the animal can see what is on the other side. This one has fuzzy plastic in the middle which prevents this. My cats aren't overly pleased with it to say the least.
3,product looks fine and arrived fast but does not fit my petsafe medium door,arrived really fast from amazon. Unfortunately does not fit metal petsafe doors the openings are slightly larger than this. I guess i'm going to have to return it ...
2,Dog/pet door flap from Amazon,"I ordered and received the replacement flap for my pet door in a very short time. However it was advertised as being the correct product for replacing my specific door but it was too short and didn't work. I made a new frame to accommodate the flap rather than sending it back and it works just fine for my two small dogs. Other than the flap not being the correct size, I think it was a bit over priced when shipping was added on."
2,"Didn't quite fit, but I made it work.","I bought this replacement flap in hopes that it fit the medium doggy door that I had in place already without having to buy a hole new one. The width was just right, but it was about an inch or so too short in length. I took a piece of the old flap and glued it to the new one and it seems to be holding. I could not find the correct size anywhere."
4,Replacement for current door.,We purchased our original door about 6 years ago. It is used daily by our cat. The replacement was easy to install and was a quality plastic.
2,Pet Safe Dog Door Replacement,Does not hold up well to multiple animals. I am replacing the door flap 2 - 3 times a year.
1,*************DON'T BUY FROM THEM********************,"I PLACED AN ORDER, AND DID NOT RECEIVE THE RIGHT ITEM. I SENT AN E-MAIL, AND WAITED FOR A RESPONSE. A FEW DAYS LATER A MAN CALLED ME; ASKING ""WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE ITEM"". I EXPLAINED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. HE GAVE ME A TELEPHONE NO. SO MY HUSBAND COULD CALL HIM BACK. THE FOLLOWING DAY MY HUSBAND CALLED, AND HE LEFT A MESSAGE. IT IS NOW 4/6/2010, AND HE HAS NOT RETURNED THE CALL. BAD, BAD, BAD -CUSTOMER SERVICE.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS VENDOR AT ALL!"
5,Easy to install,"I have to replace my flap about once every 4-6 months. With 2 dogs that love to go in and out all the time, it tears it up fast. This product is very easy to install and it keeps me from having to let the dogs outside anytime they need to go potty. Will keep ordering one every few months."
4,Dog Door,"I was very happy to be able to purchase this replacement plastic door on-line. That being said, I was surprised that the original wore out like it did. So..... 5 stars for being able to replace it. 3 stars for the product itself."
2,Petsafe Easy Fit Flap,The flap was in great condition and arrived in a timely manner. How ever it was the wrong size for my storm door.
2,Short wear life,"Flap workrd great until it started falling apart at the flexible part at the top after only 8 months in service, previous flaps of different brand lasted more than 2 to 3 years. We,ve had the same dog door and dog for over 6 years."
4,Ideal for the citizen frustrated with US Govt hypocrisy,"Bovard clearly expounds on the fact that our very own government is hiking the prices of consumer goods through the vehicle of trade restrictions. Via anti-dumping, quotas, arbitrary tariffs, and other forms of trade restrictions, America is violating the very principle of the free market that it worships. Full of countless statistics and facts (look at the number of footnotes), Bovard belabors his point beyond the threshold of absurdity."
4,"Dated, but opens your eyes","If you still believe that the US is the epitome of free trade, this book is for you. (If you don't, this could be for use as ammunition) This book chronicles the harm of protectionism (higher prices) and the many shams put on by the US government in the name of old fashioned protectionism. Whether it's farms, textiles or industrial goods, Bovard highlights the problems and perils of protectionism - by whatever name it goes by.The only big issue is the book's date - 1992. A lot has happened since then in both free trade, and unfree trade. (It would be interesting to know Bovard's take on NAFTA and the recent steel tariffs) For even more politically tense works, you can read his more current bookes."
3,Quick and simple review,"I was interested in the premise of the book, and was anxious to gain more insight into what I already knew was happening. Unfortunately the author lists statistic upon statistic and makes redundant points that the book becomes a dull read. There is no doubt what the author states is true and readers will learn more on the subject. But in my opinion, it is plain dull."
1,Does not work!,Tonka Town is a buggy mess of software. It does not load correctly. It does not load drivers correctly. We've never seen a single screen. I've got a new Del so this is not an isolated problem.Atari software support has been unable to correct my problem for 5 months and has been unwilling to send me replacement software.
3,This is not a St germain DJ mix record -,"Here are the facts. This is a record intended to only profit from the name St germain. Whether you spell it Saint Germain or St Germain, it is bound to confuse general music fans. If you want a St Germain style record - PARIS UNDER A GROOVE is the best record available at the moment which embodies that general electro jazz, funk, dub, trip hop sound.In response to the reviewer from South Carolina, the album description states that this includes St Germain. Think before you write something that will actually be pubished online.This album does not include the sounds of St germain, or one of his tracks for that matter. Three stars for marginal tracks from lounge producers from around the world."

1,False Advertsing,There is no track from st germain here. What is this all about.go check out Paris Under A Groove. That's where its at.
4,pure jazz,I was hapy to receive this cd and almost all of the songs play correctly but the last two songs will not play unless you do it manually. I Have a High end Harmon Kardon System so that is not why. I cleaned the disc but still no straight playthrough. My wife is p'od since she doesn't know how to manually start these two songs.
5,Delightfully broad scope,"Probably the best jazz cd I've ever heard. Has many great renditions that are hard to find elsewhere like the duet of ""The Girl From Ipanema"" by Stan Getz and Joao Gilberto and ""Take Five"" by the Dave Brubeck band. I was surprised to hear Fitzgerald's take on ""Mack the Knife"", as it is rarely performed by a woman. It is easy to listen to this CD over and over."
4,Fabulous Jazz with One Small Exception,"This is a really good cd, with varied jazz greats and songs everyone loves. One exception is the first track. This is the worst version of ""My Baby Just Cares for Me"" I have ever heard. I am a big Nina Simone fan, and I love that song, but this sounds like she is singing it underwater with nose plugs on. The rest of the cd is just wonderful, but I have to be sure to skip the first track when I listen to it!"
3,So-so duet,"They are both excellent singers, but somehow their voices were buried under other sounds, and this song didn't really stand out. It's too bad since George Michael has performed some great duets with other female singers like Aretha Franklin (I Knew You Were Waiting), Jody Watley (Learn To Say NO), and more recently Mary J. Blige (As). I wish they could express voices with their own personality. It sounded as if they wanted their voices to be close to each other's. This song lacks personality, but happy to own it just because I am a big George Michael fan. To be honest, this is the worst duet that I have heard George has done."
1,total piece of junk.,spent hours trying to put it together only to find out - it's impossible.junk. total junk. and a huge let down to my son.
1,"Horrible, horrible product;; buy something else.","This product is unusable; I think it is literally the worst-made item I have ever purchased and it has prompted me to write my first Amazon review to warn others not to go near it. It doesn't assemble the way the instructions describe, because slots that clips are supposed to go into are non-existent. Because of that it barely assembles at all. As another reviewer mentions, you can't use it without the frame buckling. I have thought about trying to add on pieces to make it stronger, because my son really wants to use it, but I'm afraid that if I do that it still won't hold up: it's very flimsy."
1,Too aggravating,"I understand this thing is under 20 bucks, but it was a pain in the butt. First, putting it together wasn't as easy as stated. Second my son is 5 and doesn't have a burning fastball (yet) but if the ball hit the frame, it immediately twisted, no matter how solid the stakes in the ground were. It's just not sturdy enough. It needs more support from twisting. We're returning it and spending a little more this time."
2,implausible ending,"This was a reasonably good read until the last few chapters, when an cliched ending failed to explain what had gone before adequately.I was left disappointed as I had expected more."
5,Mellow Rendering of the Turkish Repetoire,"Wonderful Turkish style solo Oud, in the style of Tanburi Cemil Bey and Udi Hrant. the great. Great music for meditation, or just chilling out with some tea and turkish cigarettes..."
2,Not the same as original,"Although these batteries cost about half the price and have the same rating on paper as the original batteries, their in-use capacity is not adequate.I have a 700VA UPS system, which is loaded to about 40% capacity, along with monitoring software. The original batteries would keep my entire system up for about 15-20 minutes during a power loss. I also have a small LED desk lamp plugged in. When the power fails, I immediately shut down the PC and can use the LED lamp for about 12 hours to supply light if needed. These replacement batteries, when fully charged, can only keep the whole system up for about 1-2 minutes and my LED lamp will only run for a little over 1 hour. You get what you pay for I guess."
4,The best to start with,A very good way to start with such a huge software as Finale is.The explanations are clear and the English is quite comprehensive even for non native English.Good purchase.
5,The beat that carries you,"To fully enjoy this CD you need a car, as you noticed in the video. The basic rhythm floating through the song is fabulous. It comes, it goes away again, then comes back in the company of a superb vocal. If you're not really into Leftfield, you probably shouldn't buy his 'Rhythm and Stealth' album, but this single really is a must."
4,Totally Hilarious!,What if you had a knight with less alturistic nobility & more profit motive? Not a mercenary;just a guy looking for a peaceful way to make a buck.Having read chapters published in(if I recall correctly)the 'Flashing Swords!' anthologies edited by Lin Carter I just had to see how the story ended.I was not disappointed.Highy suggested.
4,Questions for myself.,I really wanted to revise my high school learning about the reason and the rationale of poetry. Why does it appeal? Does that appeal come from within the poet or from something in the brain that likes rhythm and balance and a clear framework around what we read? I liked the section on literary criticism (particularly useful for me at the moment with the PhD glaring over my shoulder in the bathroom mirror every morning) and I liked the analysis of types of verse and I always love glossaries and indexes. A valuable and enjoyable text.
2,"Usable, but...","They're ok for the price I paid, but they don't actually clip on, just slide over my ears which hurts eventually and the sound quality isn't great, but I mostly listen to books on tape, so it's not crucial for me. As far as the color clips, I can't get the ones that came on it off, so I can't change it. Overall, not worth it."
5,No talent needed for incredibly sharp blades.,"This knife sharpener is great because it takes the need for talent out of the equation. Sharpening the blade at the exact same angle for every stroke allows you to get a razor edge on anything. I am really happy with this kit. I also ordered the A4X Extra Coarse stone and the A4EE extra extra fine stone, so I have a total of five stones. Everything fits in the blue bag. I am convinced I could get a razor edge on a hammer. Highly recommend."
3,cheap looking plastic,i bought this for my son for xmas. it looks ok but i have concerns about the lasting qualities of this item. the blade clamp is made of plastic as is the stone holder. other reviewers have had the clamp and the stone holder break. they should be made of metal (i bought a lansky here and it is better quality its metal not plastic). time will tell if this holds up. the price here couldnt be beat as with my lansky none cheaper than here. will shop at amazon again
3,Not bad,"One reason why I'm giving this only three stars, is because I really don't think that the components fit into the included case as nicely as they should.The second reason is that the little plastic 'nubs' broke off my one alignment component after only a few uses of the product.It will get your knives sharp, and the included serration sharpener is nice.In the end it's not bad, but I wouldn't rush out to buy one."
3,"work as expected, but won't last","This product worked as expected and can restore my knives angle. But, the stone won't last long. After 5 knives, the stones wear off quicker than I expected. It may be gone after 15 knives. If so, this will become a very expansive tool. The cost for the stone set is more than $30."
3,Good kit bad company,"I have bought this kit and two extra stones DMT A4EE 4-Inch Diamond Whetstone and DMT A4X 4-Inch Diamond Whetstone.The system is very good. If you are not having ""time+patience+300$ for japaneese stones"" it is the best way to make your knife almost ideally sharp.BUT the DMT does not have customer service!!!Read my review for A4EE 4-Inch Diamond Whetstone."
3,"it works, but","I've tried most of the systems like this one now, and they all work fairly well at first, but none of them are quite up to expectations. With this system, the stone holder is a good feature that works well, however the clamp to hold the blade is not well made, and that is a very important consideration.Also, The color coding of the stones is different than the usual practice, which is annoying if you are used to, say, thinking that red stone is the last one [fine grain]. Add to that that they aren't otherwise marked, and that they don't feel much different, and you have some irritation. Also, I admit that I wear stones quickly, because some of my special blades are harder than usual, but these wore out quite a lot faster than other systems I've had."
4,this works great if you have patience,"I used this and it was great for what it does, the angle was the hard thing for me and this was my fault didn't follow the directions, (typical Man.) Anyway worked for a time on my chefs knives, would buy again"
5,The only sharpener you'll ever need,There is nothing bad to say about this item. I have been using it for over a month and It gets my knives sharper than they have ever been in about 3 minutes each.
5,Sharp!,This little kit got my knives sharper than they have ever been. It really takes the guesswork out of sharpening your knives.
2,"Good, but short-lived. Overpriced replacement stones.","I loved this when I first bought it. As time went on, the stones wore out. New stones are way overpriced. Right now, the only part of the stones that sharpen are the extreme ends. The middle 80% of each stone does not sharpen any more. The clamp is weak, too. I am afraid to tighten it too much for fear of it breaking. So, it does not hold the blade firmly, and a very delicate touch is required.Despite the weak clamp, I could live with it if the stones lasted."
3,Philosophy from the north slope,"Having read Mr. Wright's first book, Koviashuvik: Making a Home in the Brooks Range, I was anxious to read this. Although much of the book is his philosophical viewpoint about ""life explanations"", a great deal of the wonderful Alaskan serenity and harshness comes through. I am sad to say, this writing was neither entertaining nor left me soulful. I think the author has grown old and yet as wise as he clearly is/was, doesn't fit well into 21st century solutions. I take homage at his reference to the northern lights and Billie talking to him with the same voice, and will just have to live with his first Koviashuvik stories. By the way, did anyone ever find the thief who cleaned out the cabin?"
3,I beg to differ....,"I have a wide range... can sing soprano and alto quite easily, but when I sing torch songs or other jazz/blues standards, I prefer to sing them in my lower register. This book is great with offering these types of songs, but the keys they are in are HORRIBLE! They must be transposed down to even be comfortable for a woman to sing them in that ""sulty-torch-song"" style. I wouldn't recommend it at all... instead, I found a book called ""Belter's Hot Standards."" This has been my Bible of music! Go find that book if you're a woman looking for low jazz songs."
2,A let-down,"I was disappointed with this book. There are verses missing, the arrangements were simplistic, and the ""universal"" key puts these lovely, smokey songs into a very high register for a torch singer, and a very low register for a balladeer. I wound up having to buy a different book to get the complete picture."
5,Recommendable,"Fine Rolling Stones tribute album. The songs sound surprisingly good for being recorded without direct participation of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Most I like ""Brown Sugar"", ""It's Only Rock'n'Roll (But I Like It)"", ""Honky Tonk Woman"", ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash""."
4,A Superior Tribute...,"This CD will surprise the naysayers! If you doubt the integrity of cover bands, then check this one out! Jimmy's vocals remind me of the live Mick sound, and the instrumentation is right on! This is the Unplugged album the Stones should have done! Watch for the beautiful string arrangement on ""As Tears Go By""...very nice."
5,"Just like the ""bigger"" brothers","Exceptional sound quality for a product of that category, and a good design. The sound quality is very close to the systems twice as expensive as this one.It deserves an optical input because it would fit nicely as a part of a budget DVD system at home.The range of the remote controller is insufficient (does not work well if distance is more than 4 meters)."
4,Harder to find,"I was wanting to copy some old VHS tapes over to digital, and needed a VHS player. These are getting harder and harder to find. This Magnavox is about well built as any other on the market and did the trick in getting my precious memories transferred over. I used a HT Honestech Vid Box and it does a wonderful job."
4,good performer in spite of poor packaging,"It took about ten days to receive my VCR, but I was satisfied with shippers explanation of illness delaying shipment. When i opened the package there was about thirty foam peanuts and 1 small sheet 8x10 inch piece of bubble wrap that did not really provide any protection. I plugged in the VCR and it ate my first tape immediately I thought oh well not worth sending it back, But i decided to open it and found about six foam peanuts had found their way inside the machine and jammed the mechanism. After removing those it has been working perfectly, so i am lucky to have opened it but think better packaging should be in order in the future. On the plus side the VCR works very well for the small price that i paid and i am happy with it."
5,Great,"This is a good single, one of the best songs on Rainbow, which seems to have its high points and its low ones, this song on the album however, is a high point.The single includes Against All Odds, Crybaby, Thank God I Found You (Stargate Mix) and Cant Take That Away (Morales Club Mix). All of which are great songs. Go out and get it, its worth the money."
2,Against Those Odds,"Every once in a while, when a artist comes out with a great song, they can truly go so many places. But, when they choose to perform a cover of a song, it can once in awhile back on the singer. For somebody like Mariah Carey, her songlist is quite remarkable, but she could use some improvement on some covers here & there. This is one of them. Her remake of the Phil Collins classic Against All Odds, sounds a little bit wimpy, and not really heartfelt. Even though it was good when Phil recorded it, it just doesn't seem to be a very well thought fit from Mariah. She still is a good singer, but this turns it out to be a lackluster song with the odds.Song: D+"
5,Outstanding,"I dont know why this wasnt released domestically, its a great song, and an awesome single. It has the original version of Against All Odds which is on the Rainbow album, Crybaby (also on Rainbow) which is one of my favorites because of the medley and the words. Also added bonuses are the Stargate Radio Edit of Thank God I Found You, which is an awesome remix (way better than any of the TGIFY remixes on the maxi single). And finally Cant Take That Away (Morales Club Mix Edit). I agree some songs shouldnt have lyrics, but its has a nice beat. Liked the original better though. Must for Mariah fans this single is."
5,Great For Little Ones!,"Big, bright, colorful illustrations await the eyes of your child in this book that teaches direction words. Mickey cannot find his shoe. In this work children will learn words such as, UNDER,INSIDE and BEHIND, as Mickey searches for his lost shoe.It's short and simple and a book that will help them understand the meanings of these words. Recommended.Shirley Johnson"
5,Sloppy Seconds Destroyed,"This is definitely one of my favorite albums. So good they had to remake it. With awesome songs like ""I don't wanna be a homosexual"", ""Janie is a Nazi"", ""Serious"", ""Veronica"", and ""The Candy Man"". It is a great cd that you should hear, and share with everybody. This is a bad that deserves more credit and should start touring again. Also ""More Trouble Than They're Worth"" is another cd that came out in 1998 that is worth you checking out."
4,Solid,"This is a solid EP. The full album is even better. Expect great things from Spiral Stairs. Ignore the sceptics and Pavement/SM elitists. Before you know it they'll all be on the Spiral Stairs bandwagon. So, pick up this record and the full release due out in Aug."
2,"disappointing, to say the least","I always liked Spiral Stairs better than SM. That said, I had high hopes for this record...but its not what I had hoped for. Stylistically, its all over the map. Sometimes the sound is much like New Zealand's Tall Dwarfs; other times are similar to the most generic of indie rock. The two highlights of the record are ""The Spaces In Between"", which is a distant cousin of Pavement's ""Date With Ikea"", and ""Goodbye To The Edge City"", an instrumental worthy of Spiral's former band.Man, I'm trying not to be a ""hater"". Two good songs outta five... It's nice to hear from Spiral and his new band, but I hope his full-length is a bit more tuneful and substantial."
2,Spiral Panders to the Rap-Metal Crowd,"This is a sorry state of affairs. Once a member of one of the greatest bands ever, Scott Kannberg (AKA ""Spiral Stairs"") has stooped to releasing of 5 song EP that is nothing but a constant barrage of explatives and profanity layed over brainless, chugging metal riffs. Parents take heed of the [EXPLICIT LYRICS] warning, as this is one of the most profane records I've ever heard, and a sad final chapter in the story of Pavement."
1,Buy the Gazillion Bubbles instead,"My son got this bubble blower for his birthday. The only thing we (his parents) could get it to do is create a bubble that sat on the top of the hand held piece. It would not work well at all. Now it doesn't even do that. We have had a gazillion bubble machine in the past, and they work great, just don't let your kids put sand in them."
4,Wonderful!,"This was my second time reading Hoag and I loved this book, it really does keep you in suspense until the very end. There were two things I didn't like though. The first being the French-English index in the back. I do think it was helpful, since adding some French helped create the setting in Southern Louisiana. The problem was in the hard cover edition I read, the beginning of the index was next to the very last page of the book, which of course, gave away the ending. I think there should have at least been a blank page between them, not looking at the ending on the page next to the index is tough! Also, I didn't realize that the same characters in this book were in Cry Wolf, which I have not read yet. This book seemed to give away the ending to Cry Wolf and had I realized they were sort of releated I would have read Cry Wolf first."
4,A Thin Dark Line,"I really Enjoyed this book! I always TRY and figure out ""WHO DONE IT"", but the author really Threw me... didn't Even Suspect! Love That!"
3,I wasn't trully excited about this one,The Amityville Horror or The Basenji Revelation - these are the kind of books that deserve mentioning in the mystery-horror thriller genre. Tami's book is interesting but no where nearly as thrilling as the above mentioned. Her 'Kill the messenger' was better than this one.
3,Interesting plot but has severe character problems,"As with the other reviews, the book starts out very promising. Where the book runs into trouble, in my humble opinion, is Annie's relationship with Nick. With his chanting ""control"" center"", practicing Tai Chi and then unable to control his temper, to smoking like a steam stackand heavy drinking, but he's a vegetarian (not that there's anything wrong with that), plus paranoia and obsessions. We're supposed to believe Annie would fall for this guy?! I kept thinking of the movie ""Psycho"" for both Nick and the plot. Norman Bates rules again. It's a good beach read with flaws."
4,"A bit long-winded, but definitely a good read.","Tami presents a fascinating and intricate cast of characters that sometimes fade into one another, but usually stay crisp and clearly defined. The pacing is a bit slower than I would prefer, but the exposition and description are wonderful. Despite the opinion of someone from the swampy bayous, I found the atmosphere charming, but then I also know a little French and could follow most of it in conversation. Listening to the roar of the alligators did not stay in my mind as something all Cajuns do all night, but I got the sense of a swampy, humid, warm and rich environment where superstition and old codes of honor prevail, which is just what was needed, I believe. Good job, Tami...Keep the novels coming--I'll be buying your books!!"
5,Suspenseful,Tami Hoag creates a suspenseful novel that you just can't put down. It it attention grabing and continuously makes you wondering exactly who did it.. This is the first novel that I have read by her. But now I have a great interest in reading other novels by Hoag.
5,GREAT DETECTIVE STORY & LOVE STORY,"Could of stood a tiny bit more editing out of repetitious mullings over of this and that... BUT Don't let that dissuade you from reading this book This is an excellent read. T.Hoag keeps her story at a rolling chaud boil thru out. Ending on a high positive note. (I'll be dreaming' of Nick, oui).This is my first Tami Hoag....I loved it. I can't wait to begin another!"
4,More by this narrator&#65533;please!,"I just finished listening to this tape. The story was great, but Diane Venora really made it come alive. Her husky-voiced male characters actually sounded like men. It was a wonderful treat. I could have listened for hours more of her voice and the story line."
3,Too much of a good thing.,I love Tami Hoag. Night Sins and Guilty as Sin were great mysteries. It isn't that I didn't like A Thin Dark Line; it's just that the characters are so unbelieveable. I live in the area that she used as her setting and no one talks the way she wrote or stands around listening to the alligators roar. She spent so much time trying to make her characters sound Cajun that she completely lost their individuality. And her descriptions of the area would lead one to believe that we walk around in the swamps. Hogwash! I am insulted
2,Throw out half the book and maybe it would be good,"Well, I finished reading the book---but OMG, it was slow. Ms. Hoag repeats herself silly. I wanted to scream, ""I got your point!"", over and over again. This book reminds me of a teenager who is asked to wrtie a paper and make it 1000 words long, so he fills in most of this paper with useless words trying to make it long enough. Even the suspenseful parts (if you could call them that) got old. I was yawning more than anything. I have read other Hoag books which I enjoyed, but this one was by far the worst one I have read. I think I will stop reading her books as I am really tired of re-reading and re-reading and re-reading the same thing over and over again."
1,Painful and slow,"I've tried to read this book off and on for weeks now and it is agonizingly slow. The characters are not believable or compelling and the story simply does not move. Character development is non-existent and there are too many characters and subplots that dilute the novel. The unlikely (but predictable) romance between the two lead characters is a stretch at best. When it is described it is something out of a harlequin novel only not as complex (yes, that was sarcasm). I've stopped reading it as I'd rather watch my fingernails grow. Just can't stand to waste time to get through the last 1/4 of the book."
2,Not what I have come to expect from Tami Hoag,"Tami Hoag is one of my favorite writers and I almost always buy her books. The depth of disappointment in A Thin Dark Line is virtually impossible to express. Contrived plot, unbelievable characters, and unrealistic dialogue are just a few of the things that make this effort of Tami's so unworthwhile. I normally read one of Tami's books in a single sitting - at most, two. I have been plowing away at this one for three or four weeks now. Just stubborn I guess - hate to give up. If this is the first book of Tami's you've read, please give her another chance. Her other books are really good - not like this one - at least all the ones I've read."
2,Not her best,"I liked Tammi Hoag's previous novels. This one, however, I didn't even finish, which is very rare for me. I got bogged down in the Cajun theme and slowly lost interest. I'll try again, though."
2,Didn't like,"This was my first book by Tami Hoag and maybe my last. The first few pages were good, but it quickly got too descriptive and boring. I skipped many pages. I guessed who dunnit before it was revealed."
4,I was guessing until the end!,After a friend recommended Tami Hoag's books I picked up this one as my first title. I read nearly the entire book in one day! I was sure I knew how the book was going to end but I was intrigued when the final events unfolded with unexpected excitement at every turn of the page! An excellent book for all mystery lovers!
4,skeptical but not any more,"This was my first Tami Hoag book... I was amazed. Im more into novels about werewolves and vampires(like ""Mortal Danger"" by Eileen Wilks)but this book simply blew it out of the water.Officer Antonnete ""Annie"" brousserd investigates a grizzly rape murder case with ""HOTT"" cajun french detective Nick Fourcade and... youll just have to find out yourselves, but i loved it. 4 out of 5 stars."
3,Needed Editing,"The beginning of this book was promising. A good story line and interesting characters. What ruined it for me was the writing style. Ms. Hoag was just too wordy. She explains things over and over again, as if the reader isn't likely to understand otherwise. It wasn't a difficult mystery to solve (had it figured out from the beginning), but the ending was exciting."
1,Bad behaviour,I think it's sad and low to use other peoples popularity to get some profit ... And ... please ... don't tell me you didnt know.
5,Exciting New Christian Music!!!,"One of the best Christian albums I've heard in a long time! The music is fresh and original; the lyrics are awesome--always giving glory to the Lord. The author tells of his struggles and triumphs in the Christian life using a storybook fashion. I was amazed after reading the credits that Kevin Ayers played most instruments, wrote all original lyrics, and recorded and mixed this album in his own studio. What a talented individual! A most enjoyable listen."
3,FATA nicotina,"A Spanish movie of punishing the bad at the beginning of a third millennium presents already a bit out-dated computer used to spying over sexy neighbour and hacking Swiss banks by a geek looking rather infantile and asexual.Murdering, blood, money, dimonds, Russian mafia-and everyone gets what deserves."
2,Very Low Definition,"The movie is not bad but the DVD transfer sucks. I would give the movie four stars, zero for DVD quality. The main feature, six trailers, and two language tracks are all on a single-layer disk (4.7GB) with a lot of room to spare, so the bit rate must be extremely low."
4,NICOTINA,Get the Spanish PAL version which is available and has english sub-titles if you need them. It is region 2 so you need a region free player or need to hack the one you have. Google DVD hack for instructions for your model. ed.
2,Not worth the money.,"This ring was bulky and didn't fit correctly. Wasn't made well, very large, size 12 or 13."
3,"Good ,but not in my top ten!!!!!!!!!","Hey,look at that Nikita is on it.But will i like the other tracks[thats what you're probley be thinking]? Cry to Heaven,Soul Glove,Wrap Her Up and Nikita approach listenable.Act of war is the painful low point her which is unlistenable. You decide for your self Buy or Not buy.If you don't buy i'd suggest you'd go for greatest hits volume 3 which contains the best track.Ice on fires a mixed bag."
3,Nice but formulaic..,"The highlights on this album is ""Nikita"" and ""Cry to heaven"". Otherwise it's competent but rather formulaic and bland. The freshness and creativity of his earlier records is missing, making this one of Eltons more routine-sounding albums. A dissapointment after the half-way return-to-form of his 2 previous releases (Too low for zero & Breaking Hearts). Worth 2 or 3 stars."
4,"A couple of less than average songs, and several great ones","I really like this CD. To enjoy some of Elton's 80s work, you have to either enjoy that type of production that was employed in the music at the time, or simply get past it. Behind the production of this album, there are some classic Elton tunes. Cry to Heaven, Nikita, Wrap Her Up, Satellite, Candy by the Pound, and Shoot Down the Moon are great songs. A lot of folks may disagree with me on the last two, but I think they are fun and funky. If you like 80s music, you'll probably appreciate this CD."
1,For die hards only,"Generally forgettable album from 1985 that seemed to stunt the resurgence seen on albums like ""Jump Up"" and ""Too Low For Zero."" There were a couple of hits from this one and both of them, ""Wrap Her Up"" and ""Nikita"" keep this one from being a complete lost, but you'd be better off looking for these songs on various ""greatest hits"" compilations."
1,one word... cheap. cheap. cheap.,I don't have much to say about this product as it broke the first time my son took a swing at the ball perched upon it... he's only four years old. The construction is flimsy - it's made from 100% brittle plastic. I would have rated it 0 stars if I had the option.
3,No color,The book had very limited color pictures. One can not comtemplate the beauty of the Churches of Rome without color.
1,Needs to check his facts before writing a book!,"This book was ok in the beginning, but the further I got into the book I realized that many of the ""facts"" given were NOT true. I do not recommend this book to anyone who wants to know facts about their pregnancy rather than someone's misguided opinions. He also has a very biased opinion regarding natural birth vs medicated. Dr's should give you the facts and let you decide which is best for YOU!"
3,Dismissive of Natural Childbirth,"Actually, he does make a comment comparing the cost of a home birth to the cost of caring for a vegetable. While the author is probably quite a nice person and a good doctor, he doesn't seem to take natural childbirth very seriously. I'm sure he doesn't do an automatic episiotomy on everyone, but I also wouldn't trust him as much as someone who expressly values natural childbirth to take the measures to prevent the need for one (like perineal massage, for example). If you want to have an epidural, that's fine. But if you don't, you should probably not go to a doctor like DiLeo, since his philosophy doesn't seem to jive with that of couples for whom natural childbirth is very important. Overall, though, the book does provide a lot of information about the battery of tests that you might have and what they mean."
4,Worth for the price,"If you are an experienced/serious player, I wont recommend this. But for people like me who is just starting up and plans to play once in a week or so, this is better choice.Its light, sometimes if you hit the ball strong, it makes a sound as though its going to crack."
2,Paddle Racket,My husband and I wanted to get a less expensive racket at first since we didn't know if we were going to get serious playing paddle tennis. I used my paddle once and decided to buy a better racket. There is no absorption with this racket creating a lot of stress on my hand and elbow. Both my husband and I are retired so this racket is definitely not for anyone with any muscle joint pain.
3,Edits too quick,"This video is okay, but beware that the camera rarely lingers on a scene for more than 15 seconds. Some of the most beautiful shots last for only 5 seconds before a new shot is edited in. Great looking stuff & a good picture as far as I can tell with my 720 p, but IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR RELAXATION, THERE ARE BETTER TITLES OUT THERE. The Hawaii Beaches one is much better for relaxation."
4,Good relaxing DVD,This is a great DVD to have in the background. The music is soothing and the sealife is amazing. The don't focus on the sealife for an extremely long time but if you've ever been diving you know that fish really don't stay put for very long. It's a great relaxation type dvd.
2,Cure for Insomnia,The photography in this is fabulous but with no narrative it will put you to sleep in no time.
5,Excellent Coral Reef Video!,"This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Coral reefs are perhaps the most beautiful and complex environments there are. I enjoy watching this over and over. Highly recommended.I encourage the producers of this video to offer more coral reef documentaries.If you like this, you might also likeEquator: Reefs of Riches [Blu-ray]."
3,Fish,"Purchased this DVD to see the capabilities of my new Blu-Ray player. It's enjoyable, but not the greatest thing I've ever seen. The colors in most of the scenes are a little washed out - probably do to the filming. A diver myself, I understand the affects of bright overhead sunlight and the colors of coral. This was apparently shot on a marginal day (or several scenes were shot on cloudy days). That said, the reproduction of the cloudy days underwater scenes is very realistic. Washed out purples, washed out charcoals, washed out yellows are all symptomatic of a cloudy day diving. There are some great scenes for color - don't get me wrong. The scenes with lots of little fish definitely show off the blu-ray capability better than scenes with 1 or 2 large items in the view. I give it a 3..."
3,"Stimulating, not soothing","The photography is beautiful and the variety of sea life impressive. However, I was hoping for a nice aquarium DVD to play as a calming background in the room. This is NOT it. It's more like a nature film with lots of camera movement constantly changing view. If you are looking for a relaxing aquarium DVD, you'll be disappointed. It's more like a nature documentary....without narrative."
2,Not too impressed,Not super impressed with the quality of this disc. Supposed to be in 1080P so I excpected a super crisp picture. I have seen a lot better HD on Discovery HD in 1080i.
4,Soothing sounds for calmer nights,"Soft, soothing mesic and sounds bring on a peacefull sleep, Sodt colorful pictres quite nice in high deff, Light is soft enough to leave T.V. on at night without keeping you awake"
3,good not great,picture is perfect. music is fine. way too many super close ups of boring things. more open scenes would be much better. not all bad has its moments.
2,Sugar Free Assorted Fruit Gummy Bears,The sender did a lousy job.Came in a flat envelope and candies were mashed into a lup.Shipping was too expensive for this mess.I live in Florida so maybe the temp. had something to do with the clumping.
3,A little disappointed,"A couple of years ago I bought my husband some sugar free gummy bears and they were wonderful, very fruity and big. But I can't remember where I got them so I thought I'd try these, hoping they were the ones I remembered. Sadly, they aren't. These gummies are o.k. but they don't have the intense fruity flavor or the size I'm looking for. My husband still enjoys these but not as much as the last ones. If you want a gummy like most of the megastore sell then these are for you."
4,Wisdom from God's creation,"This inspiring collection of interviews Gerry has done on his radio show reveals the foibles of all of us. Creatures from deer to skunks to bass and turkeys; and the attempts of hunters to harvest these creatures, are used to show that even the best and wisest of hunters needs the wisdom of God. Gerry regulary inserts Bible passages and Biblical truth to help the reader grasp the importance of eteranal values. The books entertains, instructs, and inspires. It is the kind of book a Christian could unashamedly give to an unsaved friend that would present the gospel clearly and effectively."
4,Great...except,"First thingz first, I love ""swords"", I jam it allll the time. This single is wonderful, except I would have liked to see a few more remixes, or at least some better ones. The 1st remix on the cd really isnt that great, I found it kinda typical. But, the leftfield mix is pimp-tight!!!! Also, for those of you who havent seen the video, this cd is worth buying for that alone!! If you love ""Swords"", then get this single. If you like the video, then get this single. But if your just lookin for a new single, then seriously consider it!!"
1,The Kid in the Red Jacket,"Have you ever had to move? Well, if you have you might know how Howard Jeeter felt.This book is about a kid named Howard Jeeter who has to move from Arizona all the way to Massachusetts. When he gets there he meets his new neighbor Molly Vera Thompson.In my opinion The Kid In The Red Jacket is a very unexciting book. I would not recommend this book to you. What I didn't like about the book was that there were no exciting parts In the book. Not a lot happened in the book. I would have liked the book more if more went on in the book, or it was more exciting.I did not like the book, so I would not recommend this book to you. Unless you think that you would like the book I would not read it."
3,The kid In The Red Jacket,"The Kid In the Red Jacket was a ok book.I reckamend this book to people who had to move and have to go to a new school and have to deal with making new friends and missing old friends.The main charecter is Howard Jeeter .He is a ten year old boy trying to fit in with kids.There's an annoying little girl on the block named Molly Vera Thompson who is six. Howard is trying to do whatever it takes to get rid of her. Howard starts to make friends, but something very bad happens. To find out what happens, read the book Kid in the Red Jacket by Barbara Park."
2,Molly is Annoying,"I didn't think this book was good because I didn't like how Molly Vera Thompson was so annoying. There was a funny part of the book.That part was when Mr.Jeeter wanted the baby,Gaylord, out of the car because he was crying and yelling. I wouldn't reccomend this book to other 5th graders."
4,Could not just read just one chapter,"I enjoyed this book because it really explains what a new kid goesthough.Bullies,making friends,meeting people are all the the things new kids have to do.Well my favorite character was the maincharacter.He has met a little girl that wants to be his friend,andbugs him every day.She comes to his house every day to talk to him.He is embarrassed by her.The whole story he is trying to getaway from her.The ending will leave you shocked.You would havenever thought that it would have happened that way!"
5,Great book to motivate kids to read!,"This excellent book has motivated reluctant readers to read willingly. Howard moves to a new town, only to be befriended by a six year old girl who wants to be his best friend. Howard learns to accept her friendship, and teach her limits on what he will and will not do. In the classroom I have had several students read this book who are usually struggling readers. The book makes them want to read. Thank you Barbara Parks. You are helping me by making my job easier!"
4,a great summary with fabulous photos,A detailed history of one the best cars made in america and my personal all-time favorite The pictures are almost too good to be true
2,"As a teacher, this is one book I won't have on my shelf.","I am a 7th grade reading teacher, and I have read both Space Station Seventh Grade and its sequel Jason and Marceline. Space Station Seventh Grade is a good book and is very true to life in middle school. Jason and Marceline consists of guys talking about who's ""doing it"" and the size of girls' breasts and how they'd like to get their hands on them. This may be the type of conversation that goes on in middle school, but I think it is demeaning to the girls. The book summary on Amazon.com says that Jason is surprised to find that Marceline rejects him, but that's not quite the whole story. Jason pressures Marceline to let him give her a hickey, and he gets angry and stomps off when she won't let him. They finally get back together, and she makes him promise he won't give her a hickey. I'm concerned that the message it sends is that girls who don't give in to their boyfriends will lose them, and that's not a message I want to endorse."
1,This book was TERRIBLE!,"I HATED this book! It's totally SICK! I'm sorry, but the boys in this book are PERVERTED! The way they talk is disgusting. This whole book is sick and stupid and you should not waste your time or money. Oh, and to all you past reveiwers who said this was the normal way teenage boys talk, I've got news for you: I know a lot of guys who DON'T talk that way and guys who do are perverted! I give this book ZERO stars."
1,"As a teenage guy, I feel a little insulted......","I really didn't like this book. Why? The guys in this book were all really dumb, which I think was kind of sexist. And the way the guys keep disrespecting girls is insulting to girls. I don't treat women that way and I hope other guys don't. All-in-All, this book was just shallow and dumb."
5,This book was soooo funny!,"I think this book was very realistic. I've read it over 5 times. My friends all want to read it. When I told them about it, they were like ""I gotta read that book!"". This book is very true. I think it would be a good book for the ages between 13-16 or a mature 12 year old. Overall, I thought the book was hilarious and realistic."
3,Pretty gross,"O.K. I know this book is pretty realistic. But, I mean, alot of the kids I know this year aren't as gross, vivid, and, well, crude as in this book. I read some parts aloud at my friend's sleep-over a few years ago, and it was so gross. And there were 4th graders at the party( my friend's little sister's friend)! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under 10 because of laungage and sexual refference."
4,"4 stars, I'll give it.","Since I'm a near 13 year old boy, this book portrayed a teen boy's life fairly accurately. With the way it is written, it shows that Jason's life as a teen is an ever-changing thing. Marceline is different. She doesn't fall into peer pressure, doesn't change just for Jason, and wants Jason to accept her differences, whether he likes it or not. I think this a good book."
5,A good book,"I thought this was a very good book. It was very funny, and true-to-life. Like it or not, this book shows a very accurate picture of what middle and high school is like. I wouldn't recommend it to kids under 12 or 13. I hope Jerry Spinelli writes another book about Jason and Marceline."
3,"This book was ok. If my mommy read it, she'd be disgusted!","I'm a 9 year old from hawaii and i thought this book was pretty good, and i thought it was cool how it was a sequel to Space station seventh grade."
2,Not very good at all.,"I'm normally a fan of Jerry Spinelli and his books but this one was, well, bad. The characters, for the most part, were pretty stupid and not very interesting. The plot was also pretty stupid and kind of dull. Also, many of the parts were disgusting. Especially the part in which the guys are talking about wanting to stick their faces in a girl's chest! (Eeeeewwwww!!!) I hope boys really don't talk like that in real life! Talk about sick!!! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read. Jerry Spinelli can do much, much better than this!"
1,A worthless waist of time.,This book was perfectly awful. If it was possible I would have givin it zero stars. I am in the eighth grade and none of the people in my school act like this. People might be thinking this but don't actually say it out loud. This book was also degrading towards both boys and girls. The one charactor in this book who I actually liked was Marcaline. I don't recomend this book for people of of any age and anyone under 15 should absolutly not read it! Save yourself the time and put this book where it belongs. In the trash can!
4,A brilliant approach to Tango dance music,"Jeremy Cohen is the marvelous violin performer on this album, a local California Bay Area man. It is a wonderful evolution of the classics. I love the cut called CrowDambo, an original. Very danceable for Tango dancers. Try it!"
5,EXCELLENT...,Couldn't find many copies of this first Goldfrapp cd single so ordered it from Amazon usa and got here in excellent condition... very happy!
4,Portland Band with Potential,"I've seen these guys play a couple of times at ash street saloon, there songs have a wide range variety which I like. One song sounds like Devo, while another song sounds like Blues Traveller.Great CD, very professional sounding !"
1,Hard to Use,This knife sharpener might be OK for someone with experienced knife sharpening skills. I was never able to master how to use it and ended up with the side surfaces of my knives scratched. This sharpener is going in the garage or give away box.
4,good but high for singing,Easy playing but the songs can get up there for family voices. Eg E and F is not uncommon
4,Good collection of songs,"I ordered this because my daughter is constantly asking me for lyrics to Christmas carols and songs; and admittedly I've forgotton a lot of them over the years! The main book contains clear notations for both piano and guitar with lyrics. The accompaniment songbook contains all the lyrics. The CD only has 23 songs on it- it's just an add-on. It would have been perfect if they had included a CD of all of the songs in the songbook on instrumental for those who can't play piano or guitar. Still, an awesome songbook for the price and a great answer to those who don't know all the lyrics ( or chords)!"
5,Great Assortment of Christmas Music,"I've had this book for decades and wanted to buy one for a friend. He saw it at our house and really loved the variety of songs. In addition to the music and words, it has chords listed. Great to bring out every Christmas Season. Enjoy."
5,Good Collection,I've checked this book out from the Library 2 years in a row for Christmas gigs and finally decided to purchase it. I use it exclusively for parties that I'm playing keyboards for.
4,Merry Christmas Songbook,"Merry Christmas Songbook is the quality type of product that one expects from Reader's Digest. It includes a great variety of Christmas music, religious and secular, with brief histories of the various songs. I plan to use it this year."
3,"Good selection, a bit simple and choppy","There are all the songs (almost) I could have wanted in a Christmas songbook, but the arrangements were too simple and kind of choppy."
5,Love it!,Love the whole Reader's Digest song book series. Had to add this Christmas book to our collection. Love the included CD. Very pleasant music. Very nice arrangements in the book.
3,I was disappointed with this collection of Christmas songs.,"Although this volume contains many lovely Christmas songs, there are many familiar carols and songs missing from this collection that contains many numbers of which I was unfamiliar."
5,Great Christmas Book,"This is a great book to have for Christmas music. The arrangements aren't too difficult and it has many songs, both those that are well-known and those that are not very common. It is also nice to have the lyric book and CD."
5,Merry Christmas Sondbook with Cd,I recieved my book and Cd so quickly and was brand new and arrived in perfect condition. Was very happy!
5,"Very cute, well made ornament",I bought this ornament as a gift for a friend and I was very pleased with the quality. I will probably buy one for myself in the future.
1,Boring,"Simply boring, the information contained would be more presentable in a book, rather than a DVD. I couldn't help but to fall asleep, even though I am deeply interested in the 2012 contraversy. I didn't even bother to play the 2nd DVD!"
5,Battlestar Galactica Miniseries,"This is the awesome start to a fantastic show. It's intense, creative, unpredictable and will leave you wanting much more. One of the top five best sci fi. I haven't seen the old series, but have been told enough about it to know that other than very roughly following the same overall storyline, the two shows are otherwise nothing alike."
3,A very resonable beginning,"While this mini series is rough around the edges, it showed great promise that has been realized in the most excellent new TV series. The plot is solid and it is an enjoyable watch. The special effects are decent and the acting is first rate. A definite must see."
2,"original no, a rewrite yes","They keep going on about sci-fi original miniseries actually, this is not orginal in the least. Yes there has been some rewrites to the story line and the characters, but this is not original. There is improvement in some other areas, but on the whole its not enough to keep me glued. The woman who plays Starbuck, obviously spent time reviewing her predecessors facial expressions and its quite obvious, instead of developing her own, one extremely noticable mention is when she hooks into apollos craft and drags the both of them back at the ship at an alaming rate, of which apollo questions this and Starbuck counters with a 'no, not really' the facial expressions she used is exactly like Dirk Benedict. The one real intriguing aspect to this series is the blonde cylon who has quite alot of human inside of her. There is looks of guilt, sadness and even a tiny bit of love if not lust, very unlike cylons. so heres to hoping the series turns out better then the mini."
1,Why no Mac OS?,WTF?!?! This does not support Mac OS? Horrible! I may never buy ANYTHING from Amazon again unless they fix this ASAP.
2,CHANGE IS GOOD...BUT THIS ISN'T,CHANGE IS GOOD BUT I FOUND THIS FAR LESS ENTERTAINING THAN I HOPED. IF THIS IS FIVE STAR GALACTICA WE'RE IN TROUBLE AS THIS THING CONTINUES. SINCE CHANGE IS GOOD HOW ABOUT CHANGING THIS FOR THE BETTER SOMEBODY? I MIGHT WATCH A BETTER VERSION OF THIS.
1,Love BSG hate the stupid download process,Who put this unbox application in production. Has Amazon lost it's mind? This application is not ready for primetime. Was the QA department paid off to put this in production? What a joke.
1,reinvention of science fiction tv??? get a life!!!,"lovers of ""sexy robots"" will get hot and bothered. others may fall asleep. and this is is the one that's supposed to ""reinvent science fiction tv""! now more than ever we need farscape back!"
1,shut out mac users,looks like they are sucking up to bill gates and triing togo head to head with itunes?but ill wait for netflixAmazon lost my $$$
2,no thanks,I wasn't turned off by this mini being unlike the original Galactica because I've never seen it. I WAS turned off by the way this mini plodded along and lost focus and by this shoddy DVD. I decided to give the mini another shot (I keep hearing how it's supposed to be the reinvention of sci fi television) but got burned by this poorly designed DVD. I'll stick to SG-1 from now on!
3,too much like West Wing,I know that the makers of this mini vowed to never have alien and alien cultures in the series (Olmos even said he'd quit is they introduced aliens) but I can't help feeling unhappy about that. I've loved Sci Fi for many years and love imaginative fiction that explores alien races and cultures. I'm not fond of the way the series keeps so close to the format of dramas like the West Wing.
2,what a waste,The special effects are very good for television. There are also some quality actors involved and some hotties. I just wish the story was worth following. It all starts with a bang and then just wimpers along week after week.
5,Super Sy-fi,Even if you saw the series on television this is a must buy for any sci-fi fan. My wife and I believe this is the best sci-fi series ever on television.
5,Best sci-fi TV show ever!,"I'll keep it short and sweet: the ""reimagining"" of the totally lame original series blew me away. Very dark, deep, and dramatic. The story, characters, and actors are all first-rate. It's reminiscent of Babylon 5 without the dopiness. The human element is so much better explored and portrayed than in any other series with which I am familiar. Check it out."
5,Amazing special effects,"I was pertty much against a sort of remake of the great 1979 series, i know many have given this serie a bad rap but still i was very young then and love every minute of this serie and the star wars era, all sci fi made in that era.I bought the dvd and popped it into my dvd with mix reviews, but after i saw that ships, the new cyclones and more i was just blown away.This serie can be enjoyed even if you never seen the original."
4,What a great mini series!,"I was hoping for a continuation of the original series, so at first I was VERY irritated THE SCIFI CHANNEL decided to forget the old series and begin again......but starting from scratch allows them to avoid all the drawbacks from the original series... Bell-bottom pants, endlessly reusing expensive model shots, and most importantly production executives that think scifi programs are for children (no moronic cyberdog in this series)The old Battlestar Galactica was WAY ahead of it's time, and I think this is what it could have been if it was created a few decades later.I still hope they do some kind of reunion program with the old actors... I miss Apollo, Boomer, and that shady character Starbuck... also I prefer the Commander Tigh from the old series... but I hope this is the start of a great series!"
2,two and a half stars,"I was going to review this DVD but Yen Nguyen's review says mostly everything I was going to say. I will add that I'm not very happy with the way Universal put this DVD package together.Side A of the first DVD says we should flip it for extras, but there are no extras on that side. The second DVD is amazingly blank on side A! They didn't even include an insert in the box.It's just terrible."
2,wait until they release a box set of season one,"a box set of season one will be released one of these days. with any luck it may include the mini series and look better than this copy. wait and get that instead of this dvd which looks crappy and the extras suck or just record the mini series from home. this dvd is a hack job. the special features option on the menu does not work and the extras are on a different disc, the picture suffers compared to what you could record on your own, and how hard is it to label a dvd?"
2,I waited a year for THIS?,They had a year to do this right. What happened?! When I got this it was a big let down. The reviewers who state that you should save your money and record this at home are absolutely right. The copy I recorded looks better than this one does. The extras (with no label at all) are unfinished scenes that are not worth buying. I guess they figured they could sell the fans anything. And they made us wait a year! For this?? Copies recorded at home are better looking!
5,"Well, Duh. Fantastic","I bought this as an Amazon Box product and it works great and looks good on my computer. The miniseries is, of course, of a quality that is seldom seen on television and I do recommend it to those who are of a science fiction or space fantasy bent. The acting is great and the writing brilliant. Of all the 'space' shows out there this is probably the best written and produced for television. I say that as a 'regular' person, not a science fiction geek person. No offense to anyone, but you know what I mean. LOL"
5,Phenomenal,This is a fast paced beginning to an awesome science fiction show. Any time you start off a show by killing off 99.9% of the human race you know things are going to be interesting. This is by far one of the most gripping and intriguing shows I have seen in a long time.
1,Frak this felgercarb,"I grew up devoted to the original (1979) ""Battlestar Galactica"" and I approached the 2003 remake skeptically. But I received the 2003 miniseries on DVD as a gift, and tried to approach it with an open mind.Afterwards I decided justice requires that producer Ron Moore be subjected to gratuitous and inhumane medical experiments, conducted by clumsy vivisectionsts in front of a warmly applauding audience. Footage of the event should be included as a special feature on all future releases of this DVD, and the director's commentary track should consist of three hours of his agonized screams.There's nothing I can add to the other one-star reviews here (if only I could give it zero). The ONLY good thing about this DVD is that it forced me to finally stop procrastinating and buy the boxed set of the original Battlestar Galactica."
1,"Garbage, pure and simple","The Sci-Fi channel should be ashamed for unleashing this idiotic, sophomoric nonsense onto the viewing public. Supposedly ""edgy"" and ""gritty,"" the characters are as weak as the stories. A minor note to the filmmakers: get a tripod! They don't cost that much, you pathetic hacks. The only ones who will enjoy this are drooling children who don't know Sci-Fi from a skin rash."
4,Ralph's Review of Battle Star Galactica Mini Series,This series is more mature than the original. The Cylon Clones add more drama. I enjoyed seeing two of my favorite actors playing leading roles; Mary McDonnell and James Olmas. They add depth to the series.
3,enjoyed it but...,I had to wait a year to get the DVD and it is cheaply put together. Now NBC is being allowed to show a butchered version of the mini? NBC will more than likely cut stuff that doesn't need cutting. What's up with butchering the mini? If they had given us a decent DVD we could at least fast forward through the parts each fan didn't care for. Letting it be butchered for NBC smacks of sell-out. I'm also hear that mystical stuff is being added to the new series and don't see how that will please fans who like the hard science approach of the mini. How can they build a fan base if they are cutting and changing things that people liked in the mini? Why not stay true to what the mini fans were a fan of? And why not give us an excellent DVD instead of something cheap and faulty?
2,quite tedious,I didn't hate this miniseries but it sure was hard to sit through all four hours of it. The special effects are well done but so much of the rest of it just fell flat. It's a sad and weird world we live in where Firefly and Farscape are gone and instead we get a tedious Battlestar Galactica which isn't really even Battlestar Galactica. Mark me up as one of those viewers who wanted very much to like this but couldn't.
4,Pretty good so far,"Interesting plotting, such as the Battlestar's decommissioning and it's un-networked computers. Apart from Starbuck's poor performance - her cigar-chomping is atrocious, and she has the most fake smile you've ever seen - it's pretty engaging. The Viper's use of low-tech ammo seems a small point but it's quite distinctive, along with it's maneuverability, and the space battles seem fresh for it. Some quibbles, to be sure - Adama takes out a Cylon a little too easily - but overall some good entertainment. 4 stars on a miniseries scale."
3,Save your money and record it from television,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the mini-series. I think SciFi's got a great show on there hands (I've seen a lot of the upcoming episodes already).BUT.....The DVD is terrible quality. I agree with AftrBrnr's comments about downloaded versions from the internet being better quality as far as picture is concerned. It's extremely grainny and washed out in many scenes. Whoever produced this DVD and it's ""extras"" must have gotten the movie from a VHS recording and then slapped a label on it. Oh wait...there aren't any labels on the discs either! While the main disc gives you the old style ring in the middle that tells you what side the movie is on, the extras disc looks like a blank generic DVD with no markings whatsoever.I also agree that the deleted scenes were of no value at all.It would seem to me that SciFi and Universal are just trying to make a quick buck with this one. Save you money. What you see on TV is better than what you'll see on this DVD."
2,you could burn a better copy,It's sad that they gave us a grainy copy with no real frills. Burn a copy at home instead.
5,A quantum leap,"""It is not enough to live; you have to have something to live for.""-- Commander Adama, Battlestar GalacticaI am an SF fan since four decades, and Battlestar Galactica (2003) is the first SF TV series I have really liked.You could say a lot about it, but basically it is the first SF TV series I have seen where the acting is top notch, and the physics are not highly doubtful. Not to mention the plot is gripping, and the special effects are very convincing. In short it is a quantum leap forward in realism.The pathos of it is extraordinary too. This is not your father's television, get ready for some trauma.So, if you have ever liked the literature of SF, but found Star Trek to be just embarrassing, then give this a shot.Start with the mini series (which is what I've seen so far), it seems it sets up the whole thing."
3,Wait for Season One,"I have seen a few episodes from the new Battlestar Galactica series and loved them (5 stars), but the miniseries was somewhat drab. The story lagged (3 hrs 3 mins), almost an hour could have been shaved off and I wouldn't have minded. Wait and buy the first season on DVD. It includes the miniseries and has much better storylines. One plus: all the questions I had after watching a few random shows from season one were answered by the miniseries."
5,Excellent Start,The beginning mini series for the remake is superb. You really get a good jump into the new universe of Battlestar Galactica. Going into it though you really should seperate this show from any feelings you had for the original. Boths shows are from such different times that they tend to very different underlying themes. Do that and I think you'll love it too.
2,so so sci fi miniseries,"This miniseries mostly appeals to those who get very excited about the word ""new"" being attached to a product. I'm not a huge fan of the original Battlestar Galactica so I was open to anything GOOD. This miniseries put me to sleep. I'm not interested in a ""old show vs new show"" debate but I watched the old show years ago and I'm here to tell anybody who claims that the old show characters lacked heart or feelings or a sense of tragedy or loss that they are dead wrong. Those are all in the original. What does this version have? Well the battles are quality fx. That's something although this version will be dated in time just as the original show has aged and this mini just doesn't hold a candle to shows like FARSCAPE. I'm all for 21st Century cutting edge sci fi but this mini left a great deal to be desired. I know there are those who are hungry for new Battlestar Galactica but you deserve better than this miniseries gave."
1,Nothing but negative,"Maybe I'm just old. I grew up with a fun TV program called Battlestar Galactica which had a mixture of fun, adventure and a little morality. This new version is nothing but dark and negative. I cannot find a single positive feeling anywhere in this program. Every set is dark and dismal. Every character has nothing but negative attitude toward just about everything. Only Mary McDonnell shows any strength of character, and she is dying of cancer?! Earth is portrayed as a lie to convince the crew and survivors to follow their leaders. If there is any redeeming value to this program, please tell me what it is."
2,nothing special,This new Galactica is fair at best. It helps provide sci fi lovers with something new to watch and that's about it. I'm much more excited about the film Serenity which continues the splendid Firefly TV series. Now THAT'S a great sci fi series!
2,"Great Series, Terrible Production","I would have rated this 1 star, but the story is still so well done.This purchase has been a tremendous let-down for me. Not because of the series itself, which many others have so properly lauded, but because of the lousy production controls on this DVD.The audio tracks and video tracks are not in perfect sync, so it looks like the movie's been dubbed over in English. It's very distracting to watch this when the words you hear don't quite match up to the movements of the actor's mouths. I can't believe something of this poor a quality would be released for sale.Buy this only if you're desperate to see the original series, and are willing to put up with the appearance of a voice-over dubbed movie."
3,attention fans: record the shorter NBC version instead,"NBC is going to show a chopped down version of this tomorrow. Don't miss it if you want to save money, get a better looking version than what is being sold, and couldn't stand the bad pacing of the mini-series. I tried to get into it and just couldn't stand it. Chopping it down is a wise move NBC! Kudos! The longer version was stretched way to thin in order to make more cash by having it on for two nights. Then the DVD gave us a worse looking version for our money. It's depressing. Now NBC offers hope at last. Thanks NBC!"
2,For fans of 911 who also like robots.,Fans of the tragedy of 911 who also like robots should enjoy this series. Those who don't like fiction that combines real tragedy with sci fi cliches may not appreciate it.
1,Bill Gates Wins Again,"I realize that PCs are dominant in market penetration, but when Amazon is up against itunes and brick/mortar, you'd think they'd use all the tools in the arsenal to make money and gain penetration as a legitimate video download option. And BSG would have been the perfect nexus of users/market leaders to serve as brand advocates. The decision to go PC only sucks. My opinion of Amazon just dropped precipitously.Sadly, the producers of BSG have done such a poor job getting their product into the hands of their fans, the options are few for those who really want to get caught up. Could there be a worse way to convert new fans? I can't think of one."
2,i wasn't hooked by this pilot,"i tuned into this like tons of other people but nothing in this pilot made me want to watch the coming series. the galactica name caught my attention but once i tuned in it was clear they had thrown the baby out with the bath water and this wasn't galactica. i then resigned myself to enjoying it for what it was but found it deeply flawed, largely empty, and looong. you've been warned."
2,More Modern Sci-Fi Garbage.,"If the sleezy, crude, cigar huffing, drunken, vulgar, slovenly, characters featured in the show are at all representative of the overall escaping colonists, one can only hope the robot Cylons destroy the entire rabble before they can reach Earth. Few of the show's actors have any redeeming characteristics, either in the roles played or their own personal appearance. Typical of many movies today, the women are often depicted as absurdly macho and the men too whimpy to control their own bowel movements. And the show itself is steeped in political correctness and the gratuitous, unromantic, often dark, sex so often found in Sci-Fi Channel's recent programming. Perhaps I'm simply not brainwashed enough to truly appreciate this movie."
2,Not a reality show?! IT'S TOO MUCH LIKE REALITY!,"Battlestar follows the same trend as reality shows by serving up TV that's more ""real"" and less fantasy and escapism. ""Reality"" TV is the popular fad, but I still like fantasy and escapism."
2,West Wing in space,"Science Fiction ""geeks"" used to be a brave lot. They were famous for having the courage to love their favorite show even if it seemed wacky to the mainstream. Now it seems that the geeks of today prefer shows that are mainly clones of other ""normal"" mainstream TV dramas. That's too bad. I miss the courage of a fan base that didn't care how wacky their favorite show seemed. I also miss the aspects of those shows that the mainstream found wacky. The new Battlestar Galactica tries too hard to be mainstream and ""real"" so it's too much like the West Wing/NYPD Blue for my taste. Somebody called it Sci Fi for those who don't like Sci Fi. I agree. That's why I can't get into it. I liked some of the ideas in this mini, but the abundance of typical mainstream TV drama elements killed it for me."
2,blank DVDs?,I should have rented this before I bought it. The flip side of my DVDs don't work. The menu claims they contain bonus features but they seem to be blank.
1,Not even close to getting my business,"Amazon made an extremely poor choice. I am freakin' not even hardly gonna install another expletive, filth, foul, bleep media player on my computer. NBC / Universal should have left their shows on iTunes."
2,it's a downward spiral,"this miniseries has some enticing parts that might hook you. sadly the series just hasn't come through with the goods yet. the ratings have been sinking. the reviewer who says that sg-1 is garbage needs to take a look at the ratings and see that sg-1 is beating ""battle"" and the ratings of other programs indicate that there are plenty of people watching other series when ""battle"" is on. there is an audience out there. the ratings have been higher. this pilot plays more and more like a one-way ticket to nowhere each time i watch it. there's still hope though. battle could be better. let's hope it turns around."
2,not the worst sci fi,"I do not agree with those critics who say this is the absolute worst. This is not the worst, but it's getting there. It's dull and falling apart as it goes. There's sex, decent fx, and some interesting actors being wasted. So far it's just slow, unfocused, and largely uninteresting. We really could use some good new sci fi on TV soon."
2,Next they'll give us serious Sleestaks!,"I completely agree with the reviewer before me. Why must we see every hokey old television series turned into a modern production? Enough already. Making a hokey series into a non-hokey series is even worse. This reminds of when they tried to make the Brady Bunch into a drama called ""The Bradys"". Marcia was a drunk. Bobby was crippled. It was supposed to be more sophisticated. Instead it was all pointless. The reviewer before me hit the nail on the head. ""So what"" indeed."
2,missed opportunity,This should have been so much better. I liked some of it (Olmos!)but they have a long way to go to improve many other things. Unfortunately from the 4 and 5 star reviews from fans I guess we can just expect more of the same from the series. I can't see having this in my collection to watch over and over but I may check out the new show and hope it's very different and much better.
5,The beginning of a great adventure,"The Miniseries is just the beginning of the best TV show currently on air. Sci-Fi fans will not be dissapointed and I believe that many other will like this show even if not ""sci-fans"". Since the very scene, this show is able to catch your attention completely."
2,wanted to like this but...,"I was bored out of my mind watching this. Is there some way we can get Farscape or Firefly back on? How about Space 1999 (great sense of mystery, fun, and no whiners), the Prisoner (another mysterious show and they didn't have to turn down the lights to create a sense of mystery), or even Buck Rogers (at least Buck was entertaining in own it's corny way). New Galactica tries oh so very hard to be serious and somber and we know it's trying to convey serious and somber because everything looks so dark most of the time. There's plenty of soap opera stuff in it too but without the high camp value of a good soap. Those who love somber and slow entertainment will like it. Others will wish it had more exuberance. I wish they'd bring back Dr Who!"
2,B.G. fans are in a category all their own,"Many B.G.s (Battlestar Galactica fans) are a fanatical and angry bunch who can't review this DVD without constantly attacking other people and other series in an attempt to prove that this show is ""the best"". Those who don't have the same view as the fanatical fans are treated like some kind of traitor to the cause. It's hard to get a fair view of this DVD.We are told by fans that the DVD deserves five stars even if it's sub par in many ways. We are told that we must buy this in order to be a ""TRUE fan"". Those who don't like this are said to be ""obsessed"" or ""geeks"" or worse. Nonsense! Be objective and not just hostile and fanatical. You really can't expect people to buy just anything to ""support"" the cause. This is a TV show not a political or religious movement."
2,missed the mark,they put all their eggs in one basket with this one. good 2003 special effects which are getting less impressive as you read this are the highlight. you need more to make this type of thing work and last than special effects but that's about it for this one.
2,Best SCIFI i've aver seen,simply:Perfect Acting - many dynamics and personalities with great script & dialogueThe special effects are some of the best i've ever seenstory is going into third season - totally addictivei cant say enough good things about the seriesyou wont go wrong with this even if your are remotely into scifi.
2,sadly pointless,Prepare yourself to have a lot of questions that never get answered. This is the pilot to the TV series and it leaves many things unresolved so that the TV series can add even more things that are then also unresolved. Most of my questions from watching this mini are still not answered. Perhaps season two will be better? Let me know. I'm not going to waste any more time on this pointless series. There's some nice eye-candy on this show and that's about it. I really wanted to like it too.
5,battlestar galactica mini series,amazon did thier job excellent condition packed well so no damage while shipping
1,don't spend your money on this,This same mini is also in the season one set so don't buy this if you are going to buy that. Save your cash.
2,Not for me.,"The idea of new GALACTICA has a lot of potential but what we see on this DVD is greatly flawed. The complaints about the pacing are true and the writing could use improvement as could some of the characters. I could go on but it would only fall on deaf ears since GALACTICA, like all sci fi shows, has attracted a loving throng of followers many of whom think this pilot for the series is worthy of 5 stars. It's too bad GALACTICA fans can't be objective enough to note the problems and call for changes. This could be the start of something great but it seems that most of it's fans think that this is right up there with the very best Science Fiction as it is. I say there's room for much improvement and if this is the best GALACTICA can offer then GALACTICA isn't for me."
2,more soap than sci fi,"I had high hopes for this series at first. The previews made it look good, but I'm not a big fan of soap opera. I made it through the first season and wont be coming back for more. I can't believe there are positive reviewers claiming that this isn't a soap opera! It's definitely a soap! We are all supposed to be wondering who is having who's baby! Instead of J.R. they shot Adama. It's a soap!!"
2,buy the first season instead,Why buy this when it's included in the first season set? There's no point in buying this twice.
3,Watch out for the combo offer,"They're offering the Mini-series in a deal with Season 1, which also has the Mini-series included. Look at the product Description for the Season 1 disc set before you buy."
5,Best sci fi seies ever,"I was a bit leery about what the new Battlestar Galactica was going to be like; after the first few episodes of the original series, it turned into ""Wagon Train to Peyton Place (or 90210, or The OC, depending on your generation).This series is anything but a soap opera. It matches ""LOST"" for plot twists, the effects are better than anything else on TV, and the actors (especially Edward James Olmos) are excellent. Also, the reruns are more watchable than ""Star Trek"". I'm buying the whole series."
4,Battlestar miniseries,"Great movie with excellent acting, dialogue, and special effects. Best science fiction I have seen."
5,Vintage People - The Secrets of Successful Aging,"If you have a desire to live a successful/healthy/satisfying life as an older adult, this is the book for you! It will encourage you over & over. It could very well change your life."
5,Awsome Pictures and info,Great Book. Many old pictures of Vegas. Shows some awsome old Casino Chips Pictured. Talks about the behind scences life of vegas. One of the best books out there.
2,Expensive for the content....,"This was a pricey book for the content inside. Lots of ""artists renderings"" v. actual photos. I also expected more written info. This is really just a coffee table book. The photos that are inside are cool as are the pics of old casino chips and swizzle sticks. Unless you are planning to display I would look for a used copy."
2,"Disappointing, poorly written and clumsy!!","I bought this book with high expectations becasue of the very focused title. But the book turned out to be really disappointing. It is written like an academic article - theory and more theory. It is not an easy read, it does not engage the reader and it lacks good examples. Finally, the book is kept short at the expense of elaborate explanation of many a experimental design.The book was so poorly written and clumsy that I returned it to Amazon with a couple of days. I do not recommend this book. There are many other good experiemental design books out there in the market. The one written by Jamec C. Goodwin is a much better alternative.Bottom line - Pass this title and avoid the disappointment."
3,eh,"This honing guide works well enough if you have a wide iron or chisel. However, the roller is only a half inch wide and if you try to sharpen something thinner than one inch you will get frustrated. It's hard to get a square edge. It just takes a good deal of patience and hand control. If you are in the market for a honing guide try to find one with a wide roller or a roller on either side of the blade. That will stabilize the blade better and allow you to achieve a square edge with minimal effort."
5,excellent,I have the first book Rodolphe L. Desdunes wroteand I enjoyed it. Also I am doing research on my ancestryso the book came out just in time.H e is my father's GGGuncle.PS:once again I have really enjoyed both of his books.Thank You
1,,"And here we have more At The Gates worship in the form of One Man Army and The Undead Quartet (wait, it can't be a quartet since there's five people in the band...). Had this come out 10 years ago, it probably would have created a buzz in the underground. But listening to it in the year 2006, you can't help but think how many times this style of Swedish Death/Thrash Metal has been done to death already. A few interesting solos and the quality drum work is what kept me listening to this, not to mention the crystal clear production that gives the music the room and ambience it needs to flow. Unfortunately, the music is just ordinary. Oh yeah, they have Johan Lindstrand of The Crown on vocals if you're interested."
3,ability to float your head off,"The Gandharvas have the ability to float your head off your shoulder and away, as displayed on the popular single from their last album, with an airy, drifting shower of sound--unfortunately that ability is put to use only once or twice on this album. Instead, we get entertaining music with sparkles of that possibility. You just wish they'd let go of the tight hold of the reign over these songs, and be off where they may. They do let loose on the closer Diaboloney and in a rowdy, uncouth way--but they would do best to do more as they do on Waiting For Something To Happen/Reprise, which fades in on itself before a fuse is lit and the song burns brightly from the inside out.The Gandharvas would sound better for me if they let their dreamy side wash over all the nasty edges."
4,Gandharvas are soon to be your favorite band...,"If you are currently a fan of this musically innovative Canadian group, you will love their third album. Sold For a Smile leans toward the harder-rock side of the Gandharva repertoire, and Paul Jago's musical genious shines through especially on songs like ""Waiting For Something To Happen"" and ""Shells"". A fledgling Gandharva listener might enjoy their second album, Kicking in the Water, more than this one."
4,I only know one song,"I only just learned today who sang the song""First day of spring"", but I had to write and tell people it is probably the best song in the world and I am currently trying to find the cd so I can listen to this group in its entirety."
1,"The First Day of Spring is Good; the Rest, Bad",Too bad the single wasn't available. The rest of the album sounds like really bad Blind Melon. The Canadian music scene is hopeless. It should be broken up and incorporated into the American music scene.
5,KICK a**,"I don't have much to say. In short, this book is one of the most detailed and interesting air force books I have ever read while still being entertaining. I hope to some day be in the air force and this book gave me as much, and maybe more info than the entire drawer full of air force books I have. BUY THIS TODAY!!!"
4,Accurate account of a top Air Force Base and its mission.,"Mr. Clancy is right on when it comes to writing about the military, I only wish I had as many powerful allies in the military. His ability to capture both the science of flight and the thrill of getting aboard a F-15E Eagle and hitting the target range is excellent! He uses descriptions of how air power made it possible to swiftly win the war over Iraq, and incorporates inverviews with key commanders from that conflict!One piece of advice, I too hope that someday the Republic of Vietnam decides that communism isn't for them and revolts, but that type of fiction is better left for one of his action/thriller novels.I am about to enter the USAF, and piced this book up to begin to familiarize me with the language and equipment the USAF uses to carry out its various missions. It certainly was the right choice."
4,The new United States Air Force,"After the end of the cold war the USAF, just like the other service's has had to endure budget cuts. forcing them to reorganize... This book explores that reorganization and the new formation that has evolved from it... The Composite Wing. It's strange that Clancy calls this book Fighter Wing, since the whole book is devoted to explaining this new concept, wherein the wing consists of one squadron each of F-15E's, F-15C's, F-16C/D Block 52's, B-1B's, and KC-135 tankers. Some parts of the book may be considered boring but it's still a good read"
4,One of the Better Ones,"This is one of the better books in this Tom Clancy series, especially if you are interested in the subject. One interesting observation is that in Tom's interview of Chuck Horner, General Horner doesn't come off as well as he does in ""Every Man a Tiger"", especially in comparison to the parallel John Warden interview. Colonel Warden is a visionary who wrote a groundbreaking book on air operations and knew enough military history to consider writing a book about the Alexander the Great and his relevance today."
4,"Fiction is good, but Non-fiction is better","well, i havent finished it yet, but from what i've read its very good. It provides an understanding of the military comprehensible to civilians. Kudos to Clancy."
2,weckl dvd review,"- spends alot of time showing of his chops with no explanation- the basics that he shows are pretty basic, how to hold sticks, sitting on the stool, tuning.- says you should buy somebody else's books to learn how to do what he does?!?if you are hoping to learn something from this dvd, i would pass. if you really like his style and sound and just want to watch him play for about 40 minutes, then this would be for you.I returned this dvd"
5,One of the best insightful drum videos of all time,"Dave Weckl is not only a great drummer, he is also a very, very good instructor. In this video, Back to Basics, he doesn't only cover the basics of Stick Control/Techhiques and Bass drum Techniques but also covers some advance topics such as independence and attitude. I have purchased over 40 instructional drum videos but this one by far is the best and the most educational drum instructional video I have ever had. I have reviewed it several times already. It's Excellent and I recommend this to drummers of all levels."
5,Dave Weckl's Best DVD,"I know by looking at all of the reviews on Weckl's DVDs, I had a hard time deciding what to buy. This is, by far, the best one. Even with advanced drummers, you'll get something out of the basics here. Weckl, although gives some basics, actually puts some really good insight on to them, it's very surprising that even though you're advanced you can get something out of it! Definitely recommended!"
4,peaceful and relaxing hula music,"I loved it!!! Especially ""Kawika"" its beautiful,light and fun. I use it for my massage spa also...my baby goes to sleep when she hears it and ilove to hula to it!!!"
1,"Didn't get what I wanted, very misleading and mistrustful!!","You don't get envelopes and cards when you order, only cards... and who needs just cards??!!Instead, you should get what the picture shows, matched envelopes with cards. What an idea, huh?"
1,"2 copies, neither worked on my PS3...",I preordered this because I have been eagerly awaiting an HD quality fireplace experience but it will not play on the PS3... can't speak for other Blu Ray players. After getting a replacement from Amazon it had the same problem so I need to send both back and get a refund. Odd that my HDScape fish tank works fine... probably a small company without a Quality Assurance department.
1,Be Careful,This DVD is in the old HD format and if you don't own one of those players it is absolutely usless to you as it was for me.
4,Blu-Ray Fireplace,"Very nice, high quality graphics, but only about 4 selections possible.Limited music choice available, but worth the price.Recommended but not as good as the aquarium disk."
2,Fireplace,The Audio on the HD DVD side seems to jump all the time. Had to use the DVD side all the time now...Can I get this replaced?
1,Not much protection,"I was really disappointed when the case arrived. It was a flimsy two piece plastic, designed to snap aound the Treo. The tab on one side did not even engage, so it was totally worthless. Even if it had, I don't think I would have trusted it to hold my PDA and not pop open if bumped. I eventually bought a leather case which also protects the screen from contact and damage."
5,Wonderful piece of history,Bell compiles some wonderful information about the topic of anorexia among Catholic saints. I have given it five stars simply for the work that went into compiling this informative piece of work. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
1,Do not bother reading this book.,"This book typifies the problem of our patriarchal society. Not only is it poorly researched, but I find the writing self-indulgent and empty. Bell's understanding (or lack there of) of anorexia is insulting to humanity."
5,YES!!!,absolutely love this manga... one of my favorite shojo manga... slowly adding to my collection. shipped so fast. very happy with my purchase.
3,Skull bone pewter armor ring,"My son likes the ring but unfortunately the metal is so soft he is afraid to wear it. This will easily break if adjusted more than a few times. Shipping was great, item as described. Great seller."
5,Best of a bookshelf,"I've got a bookshelf of both new and old Greek history, historical novels, even historical fiction. Nothing even comes close to the information, originality of approach and pure delight in reading than this book. If all my school text books would have been this interesting, I'd be up to my umteenth degree by now and still going strong."
2,"A book that will be very useful for my trip to Ethiopia, but...","A wealth of information for my upcoming trip to Ethiopia. However, the font/type is so small that it is impossible to read without a magnifying glass. I always buy Lonely Planet guide books for everywhere I travel, and none of them have this problem. Perhaps the problem arose because they tried to put information about two countries into one book."
2,Not to Lonely Planet Standards,"This book was disappointing. Very very few pictures, outdated visa requirements about yellow fever vaccinations (which I've read elsewhere have never been a requirement), not much basic travel information (like country weather, dress, currency) which is usually covered well in Lonely Planet books, like LP China, for example. The writers are clearly European, but their strong style leaves me wondering what nuances I may not be picking up on as an American. These omissions make me less confident about the other facts and recommendations given in the book. None of the writers are female, which also makes me wonder if the places they felt safe would be comfortable to a female traveler. All in all, this book was not as thorough and well researched as other Lonely Planet books I have read and used."
3,Needs pictures,"Still doing the travel planning. the overviews, history, and maps are all helpful, but it sure would be useful to have some photographs. We were big fans of Rick Steve's travel book for Spain, and hoped for something similar. Jury is still out on this one, but will try to remember to revise/update review AFTER the trip.Ethiopia, 5th (Bradt Travel Guide Ethiopia) came highly recommended...but only heard of it after already having purchased Lonely Planet."
2,Get the Bradt Guide.,"I've used both the Lonely Planet and the Bradt Guide for a visit to Ethiopia at the end of 2009; it should be noted that a new edition of the LP came out two weeks after I returned, and that the edition I used was three years old when I used it.My opinion, based on the 2006 edition: don't bother with the LP. Prices are completely inaccurate to the point you wonder if they ever were remotely correct and crucial information is lacking and inaccurate: according to the LP one bus trip takes six hours by minibus (it takes ten) and there is no specific place to catch one of these buses (there is). The Bradt guide is much more accurate, has a more comprehensive listing of hotels, restaurants and more background information on Ethiopia. Do yourself a favour.Ethiopia, 5th (Bradt Travel Guide Ethiopia)"
3,"Good, but not great.","I was in Ethiopia in January this year, using this Dec. 2009 edition of this book.Almost all hotel prices were higher in Ethiopia than in this book. In Gonder I wanted to sleep in the ""Genetics Guesthouse"", recommended by this Lonely Planet as ""our pick"". When the hotel owner showed me my room, I couldn't breathe for an instant because of the strong smell of urine that came out of the bathroom. In addition, the price was birr 200 instead of the 150 indicated by the LP.This Lonely Planet edition also didn't mention that nowadays, you have ATM's in most cities that accept debit cards (like Maestro), so no need anymore to change large amounts of euros/dollars or get money the expensive way using your credit card.Still, this Lonely Planet is much better than nothing, but it's not as accurate as the Lonely Planets I'm used to."
2,most disappointing LP so far,"travelled through Ethiopia with this guidebook and was very disappointed. The accomodation references are poor (better ask a cab driver), so are the historical descriptions. Also (but this is an LP thing) it's good for people who like to be told by the authors what you are supposed to see, if you like other things you have to ignore the author's comments at all costs."
5,Delicious! Convenient & healthy too.,"Garlic Chicken is my favorite Ensavor flavor - not too sweet, not too sharp, not too ""garlicy"".As a diabetic, I need to eat six times a day, even when I'm on the road. When I have a microwave available, I use it. But when I don't, I park my car facing south, leave the pouch on the dashboard, and heat it up that way.Each Ensavor meal is ready to eat, nutritionally balanced, and portion controlled. Getting hungry while away from home used to cause me great anxiety, as my tradeoff was a diabetically unsound meal vs. delaying my eating, and enduring headaches and light-headedness. Ensavor really satisfies. Bravo!"
2,Not So Good,"Although the Beef variety is quite good for a shelf-stable product, the chicken does not taste very good. It has an odd sweet taste and it doesn't look good out of the package. I couldn't finish the pouch."
2,Needs Work,"I appreciate the effort to try and create a quick meal for diabetics, and this was a good first try, but back to the drawing board folks. I got six of these for my mother and they were not weel received at all. Smell is a bit off-putting, and the carrots were larger than the pices of meat. There needs to be the appearance that you are getting something; diabetics already feel like they are missing out. finally, the taste. not horrible, but not good. Fantastic concept though. i bet in a few years of experience and research, you will have a wonderful product."
2,Much too sweet tasting and contains splenda!,"If you really like Chinese food, you might like this chicken stew. However, it was much too sweet tasting for my tastes.The main reason that I give it 2 stars is that it contains the artificial sweetner Splenda (see ""sucralose"" in the ingredients), but that is not advertised anywhere on the package besides the small print in the ingredient list.I personally don't eat or drink products that contain artificial sweetners for various reasons, and had I known the product contained Splenda, I wouldn't have purchased it honestly. It has the typical Splenda ""after taste."""
3,Incomplete panel..,"I have other sunforce 80 watt panels and they all perform wonderfully well. My issue with this panel was half the hardware was missing. Normally the plastic bags holding the parts are sealed, but these were opened. I improvised the mounts and made it work anyway - just something to be careful of in your shipments."
3,Great Panel - packed poorly,"The panel is great - built very solid, as well.One thing I did not care for: it was packed poorly. An extra layer of heavy cardboard on the outside of the box would be good. The mounting- kit, cable and free tester were just floating in the box. I bought two panels (2 separate orders) - both times it was shipped in the same manner.The panels would deserve 5 stars... but because of poor packing... only 3 stars."
5,high quality panels for the money,"I installed ten of these panels to supplement my three wind turbines, charging a 5,000 amp-hour battery bank, and they perform as advertised. I've seen the array deliver up to 72 amps @ 14.5 volts with the sun shining directly on them. On a dark, overcast day each panel puts out about 14-20 watts. The price per watt-hour is considerably higher than wind power, but the fact that they make power every day makes them a nice supplement to an existing wind power system."
5,A must have for starting rehabbers,"We have read several of the recommended books for home rehabbing. This is by far the BEST. It is full of the details you need, and truthful advice. If you only read one book before starting-- it must be this one."
1,written for the 4th grade drop out,"This book is for somebody who barely knows what a house is. Very over-simplified, e.g.: get a house that's run down, then fix it up and sell it for more than you paid for it. No duh! Written in very simplistic terms. Then again, I just read the first few pages."
5,This is the Rehab Investment Bible!!!!!,"I am a Real Estate Agent focused on working with investors and also teach classes to investors on rehab and rental investing. This is ""The Bible"" I utilize this book and two others for about 75% of the material I speak on. At my seminars this is one of the two books I give out to the attendees. I have also spoken with the author on a few occassions and have been even more impressed after speaking with him. I recommend this book VERY HIGHLY!"
4,"""An excellent treatise--especially for novice rehabbers""","This was a great book, it left few stones unturned. The author is a licensed appraiser with a lot of experience in the field. I felt that this book was on par with all books on this subject that I've read so far. My only complaint is that this book is a little dry. I spent much longer reading it than I planned, but that's ok. Another drawback is the lack of tax-shelter information, something that all authors of this sort of book seem to ignore. Anyone looking into getting into the real estate business, and especially the rehab market should add this book to their library."
3,Great for beginners,"This book is a great tool for beginners, but if you have had some experience or read other books about real estate, you might not get much from it."
5,New in the Business,This book is an absolute must for those who are new to this business. I live in South Africa - and altought most of the referrals are to the US - the principals stayed the same and can be used effectively in the Property Business.I recommend this book for anyone who wants to start a rehab business.
2,Forgot something?,Meyers wrote this book in 1998 but apparently decided to ignore the tax liability of flipping houses. The 1997 Tax Act will have a serious impact on anyone who follows Meyers method of getting in and getting out as quickly as possible. Ignoring the possible 39% taxes a short term flipper has to fork over makes Myers examples too rosey. The book does give great ideas as to where to look for bargins and how to obtain financing. This book is not meant for anyone who buys and holds but only for those who buy and sell. Flippers beware...pay attention to your tax situation. Read Irwin's guide to the 1997 Tax Act.
5,Puts all of the pieces of the puzzle together,"If your interested in reading an instructional book that putsall the pieces of the puzzle together concerning the process ofrehabbing properties, then this is the book for you. This book is a must for yo ur library if your in the business of fixing up properties full - time, part - time, or just plain interested in getting started. Kevin Myers does an excellent job of explaining the entire rehabbing process from start to finish. These are just some of the topics he covers in his book: outlining a plan for success, working with your real estate agent, where to get the money to get started, street smart negotiating , and several more comprehensive topics that will surely set you on a path towards success. This is by far the best instructional book I have read to date concerning the process of rehabbing properties. I highly recommend it!"
5,Best Real Estate Book I've Read So Far!,"My spouse and I plan to start investing in real estate, both rehabbing and holding to rent. I the past six weeks I have read at least 10 books on the subject. This is the best by far!!! Mr. Meyers explains things in an easily understood way for us novice investors and takes you through the rehab process step-by-step. Definitely a good buy!!"
5,"A solid, enlightening laugh-out-loud textbook.","Bohren has got to be one of the best teachers in the world, and his contribution to this book is evident on most pages. Examples are lucid, end-of-chapter review problems are stimulating. Makes you look at science a little differently. I would recommend this book to all people from the mathematically astute atmospheric hobbyist to the grad student looking for a thermo reference, or something while studying for comps or qualifying exams. This will be the most useful scientific book on your shelf, and may even qualify for a position on the coffee table!"
2,"Protects faceplate, but belt clip is flimsy","I've had this case for about 6 months now, and it does a decent job protecting the faceplate. I've had no problems with the velcro fastener, either. A major complaint, though, is that the leather covering on the metal belt clip tore away after only a few weeks of use, leaving the sharp clip exposed. This has made it difficult to get the clip onto my belt, because the remains of the leather clip cover bunch up at the top of the clip. It has also left scratches on my leather belt, which is annoying. Overall, it hasn't worn well, either -- the seams are coming undone, and the elastic on the sides is fraying. It makes a good-looking phone appear cheap."
5,An inspiration for all,"Like another reviewer, I also have the pleasure of knowing Joe Martin. And while I knew of some of his remarkable achievements, I was astounded to read of many more. Like Joe, I have ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. He, and his book, have inspired me to live life with joy, love, purpose, hope and faith notwithstanding the ravages of this disease. His book, like Tuesdays With Morrie, should inspire anyone and everyone. But while Morrie spoke as a dying man, Joe, with the same terminal illness, speaks with the vitality of a man truly living life to the fullest.Laura Murphy Atlanta, Ga."
1,Hire an editor,"This book would have earned a higher score had it not been so full of errors. My husband recently purchased this book to help him study for the ASVAB. We chose the Princeton Review one because we thought we could trust the name. There are countless errors in both the explanations of how to take the test as well as the practice tests. In a novel a few typos are harmless, but in a test prep book, it renders it useless.The format of the book is good. It is divided up into clear sections with practice tests throughout. I hope that the next edition is more thouroughly proof read so that it can be helpful to others."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this book a few months ago to help prepare me for the ASVAB, and wish I had bought something else now that I'm finishing the book. As another reader stated, there are A LOT of typos, wrong answers, wrong questions, wrong explnations, etc....that will really frustrate the reader. Especially when it comes to the math problems; you'll be left scratching your head time and time and time again trying to figure out how they got an answer to a problem, when it is actually the wrong answer. If you are a bit rusty on math, which most people are, this book might do more harm than good. Although I haven't tried another book, I strongly suggest getting something else."
1,Mistakes,"The math section is awful. It's full of errors that only serve to frustrate and confuse. They will give you a problem to solve and you'll solve it only to find out that the answer in the back is done using a formula that makes no sense, or they have changed numbers in the problem. Not all of them are wrong but there are a few. Example It says to get the circumference of a circle the formula is 2P r(sorry i cant find a button for pi) one page later it asks you to solve the circumference of a circle using the formula Pi R squared. It's little things like this that make it a bad test prep. It's very confusing"
3,live @ town hall,"a may 1st, 1965 live recording of ayler's wild free form dixieland jazz. this is a good performance let down by some sub-par sound quality. the rhythm section is blasted out of range by the power of the trumpet and two saxaphones. certainly not a good starting point for those interested in exploring ayler's catalog; but an interesting historical document, nonetheless."
4,"Great product - two screens, professional screen.","This is a great screen for the price I paid. It came with two screen fabrics(white and gray), I am using the white one. so far great picture quailty. Be careful not to tension the screen too tight at the middle of the long section. I almost bent the frame trying to do that. Took a couple of hours to get the whole thing assembled(only one person). As one of the other users pointed out, the instructions could be a bit better, and the small screws etc could be packaged better."
3,Decent screen,"I am not a picture junky, so I am not sure if this is made of the best quality materials, but it was the cheapest I could find with black velvet surround and full tension in the back. However, when shipped, a bag of parts was opened inside instantly worrying me that parts were missing (fortunately, they weren't). Next, the one page of instructions made putting it together most difficult. We had to take it apart three or four times due to missed instructions (the pictures do little to help). The worst part, however, is that as we tightened screen to full tension, the frame was not strong enough and buckled in the middle. After many trips to the hardware store we found items to support the frame to get it close to straight, but not perfect. If you buy this screen I would recommend reinforcing the frame before tightening the screen to save you a lot of trouble. The product meets my needs, yet was a pain to set up."
1,Amazon.com prime sent wrong item,"Make sure when you order this you check and see what is in the box. I looked forward to this great 110"" screen and when I opened the box the day I had installers coming to hook it up it was a 93"" manual pulldown screen, about half the value of what I ordered. I called Amazon immediately and they told me I had to pay to ship it back but if it was their fault they will cover my shipping. I hope so, it was $23 to ship back to them. There were several stickers on the outside of the box, one was a little loose than the others, and this was the one that said 110"" screen. The stickers on the side of the box told the truth. So, I guess I really never actually rated the product because Amazon prime sent me the wrong one."
2,burn baby burn,tingle? no it burns... and the smell is overwhelming... i'm glad this was a gift and not something i wasted my money on..
2,nothing great,"Although you feel a very slight tingle (almost like little bubbes popping), it's definetely not worth the price. I definetely wouldn't purchase again."
5,Excellent text,"Not many scientists can write but Peter Kennedy is NOT one of them. He presents the mathematical and statistical information in clear, concise language. A wonderful AND informative read!!"
4,Review of Dreamate Sleep Aid,Tried it several times and it got better and better. Don't use it all the time but occassionally. Would recommend to a friend.
2,synthetic upper,"This boot is not constructed of leather. It is all synthetic man-made, top to bottom."
5,I truly connected with this book,"Many of the stories and feelings were similar to mine. I especially liked the biblical verses and letters of encouragement on each page. The book is not meant to be an encylopedia of answers, but rather a book that allows you to find answers within yourself and through your faith in God. The reference to Psalm 23 is powerful and personally meaningful because we recited it at our daughter's burial. As I continue to heal, it is my reference book."
5,Great Family Movie!!,"Set in the smalltown early 1900's,Lee Marvin stars as a wealthy landowner who takes in a stray boy under his strict supervision which draws resentment from the townspeople.The boy then befriends a wild horse who races him and at the end of the race results in a hilarious town brawl.This is a great family movie!!"
4,What's with the ghosts?,"The ghost Lucia sees rising from the well is not the only ghost in this production. When the singers move onstage, they leave a shadow trail. This was very distracting."
1,Purchased for deadmau5 head,"I purchased this food cover for the construction of a deadmau5 head in hopes that the 11.75"" diameter would work for the mouth opening. I disassembled the cover and the mesh isn't big enough to cover the mouth opening of a 14"" head. I would have given this product 4 stars had I purchased it for its intended purpose. Good quality item for a food cover, unusable item for the construction of a 14"" deadmau5 head."
4,not typical,"Its not your typical dnb cd, which i respect, it has more of an Aphex twin style to it, I dont know whether to say yeh or naw, its got its up and downs in my book. unique styling though, grungy and kinda hard, ive heard better mixes from clever though...."
2,boring,as far as drum and bass cds go this cd was terrible very boring and anything with clever on the cover im going to stay far away from nuff said.
5,Very interesting insights on Canada's democracy.,"I really enjoyed reading The Friendly Dictatorship. It gave this American a better understanding on how Canada's government works. It certainly helps me get a better picture on what is happening now, especially with the general election to be held on January 23, 2006. People who are interested in Canadian politics will love this book!"
5,Need to Lose,"I have a Body Dome for quite a few years and have never watched the instruction video as I don't have a player. I now have a DVD player, where can I get the DVD's? If not available, is it legal to copy the tape to DVD? I won't be selling it. Thanks"
1,Avoid,It has been awhile since I tested this software. After first use I returned it to the provider for a refund. I don't remember the details as to why but I just didn't like the interface and operation.
3,POSTNET BARCODE will EXPIRE,"I've been using MYMAILLIST for 15 years with success. However, the USPS (Post Office) is expiring the POSTNET Barcoding method beginning May of 2011. I've been trying to contact MYMAILLIST/AVANQUEST, however, they don't seem to be aware of this issue. If you are purchasing this software to create Bulk Mailings, DO NOT BUY IT unless the company addresses this issue."
2,Great Way to print mail labels,"I have used versions of this for years to do my Christmas cards, birthday cards, packages etc. Worked great until I tried to change computers and transfer my files. Lost all my mail lists. Big problem when trying to transfer your program and download your files to another computer. The new computer and this program will not allow you to download your old files into the program again. If you start to call tech support, pull out your credit card and expect to be charged a BIG charge for their technical advice...... No new updates for Windows 7. Time for new program, for sure."
3,good but my chocolate came dry and melted...,"I bought two boxes of Pocky, one for my friend and one for me( so I wouldn't eat his box LOL) I was happy that the chocolate arrived in the mail very early but when i got them, they were dry and melted together. It was still good chocolate but think that the seller should store their products better when they ship them out to their customers."
1,Politics and Inaccuracies...Very Disappointing,"I am an occasional reader of this author. I find the books entertaining. Never read any of the horse stuff, and the political narrative concerning fox hunting, the glossing over of the brutality of the endeavor, and the fact that the author is trying to convey that this is not a rich man's sport is laughable. Anyone who owns a horse knows that it is way more expensive than owning cats and dogs (as if that is cheap) and is not your average middle class worker. I very much do not care for books that distort cultural differences to pander to a certain set of people. Not my views, not my cup of tea."
3,Come for the Gossip,"This is the fifth in Brown's Sister Jane fox hunting series and I would recommend reading the others first, in order. Outfoxed, Hotspur and Full Cry are splendid fun and decent mysteries. The Hunt Ball is a weaker mystery but still splendid fun and it sets up the conflict played out here between the Master of Foxhounds Jane Arnold and Crawford Howard, a former member of the Jefferson Hunt Club.This book still has the wonderfully evocative hunt scenes that are the hallmark of this series. Excellent lore about horse, hound, fox and hunt club etiquette make this worth reading as long as the reader can tolerate in the eccentric habit the author has of putting long-winded and wordy speeches into the mouths of animals.And ""Sister"" Jane Arnold is an interesting character. Although she is over seventy, one simply has to check in to see what is happening in her life with her new boyfriend."
4,The Hounds and The Fury,"Great book, another milestone for Sister Jane. I like how the characters are evolving in the series. Great fun to read, great to listen too as well. The author does a great job bringing her characters to life."
3,Condescending Huntress - the Egoist has landed,"I was very disappointed in the changes in the main character, ""Sister"", from a 73 year-old honorable, respectful environmentalist and 'sage'/protector of her community, to a somewhat self-centered younger woman searching for the right mate.Ms. Brown's Sneaky Pie and fox hunting mysteries have always given me great pleasure until the Hounds and the Fury. I had the very strong sensation that Ms. Brown used three-fourths of this book to expound on fox hunting and her rise to Master of Fox Hounds in her private life. 'Tooting her own horn' so to speak. If I could get my money back, I would.I hope that this is not a trend and that Ms. Brown returns to her previous writing style re: ""Sister"" and her world; if not, I will not be buying anymore of this series. If Sneaky Pie's mysteries change radically, as well, I will not buy more of them."
3,THE HOUNDS AND THE FURY,"I enjoy Rita Mae Brown's Sneaky Pie series very much but this latest novel featuring the Hunt and Sister left me wondering about this theme that Ms. Brown is trying to ""get across"" to the ""straight"" crowd. Her political views would be better kept to herself, the snobbery of the Hunt Class and the people involved always ""inserting"" a lesbian character is leaving me cold. Story line is good, but I could do without her personal life opinions."
2,i hated it,"I've long loved the Sister Arnold series but this one was just too much to stomach. It's preachy, that looooong section on England's foxhunt had zip to do with the story and was a personal argument from the author. Second, I found myself pitying the one character the reader was meant to hate--- this character was far more interesting than the good guys. As for the good guys they suddenly came off as smug and downright cruel to anyone who wasn't in the circle of Sister's friends. Speaking of Sister, I didn't like what's happened to her character, she's changed. I didn't like this version of her at all--maybe Brown just didn't put enough effort into this novel. The animals were wonderful but there wasn't enough of them. I found myself getting irritated as I read Hounds and the Fury and had to force myself to finish it. Will I buy the next book? Maybe, if I find it used somewhere and even then, only if it's super cheap."
3,"Book, Hounds of Fury",I may be getting bored with Rita Mae Brown books. It seems like the story lines are all the same as previous books of hers.
3,Description and photo do not match item accurately,This is a model not a toy for young children. The product description claims that it snaps together and needs no glue. But there is no way to put this model together without glue. It is very delicate with many small pieces. There are markings and notches to ensure that the pieces go together in the correct position but they do not snap together. The coloring on the picture is not accurate either. All the parts are either a solid dark brown or dark gray.
5,just add a little glue,"we are slowly but surely building a o gauge train layout and this product was perfect, you just have to add a little glue. it's makes the layout come alive."
2,"good finch feeder, but......","This feeder is for thistle, which finches love. They are attracted to the feeder. However, when it rains, the (very expensive) thistle gets wet and clogs the tiny feeder openings and they have to be cleaned with a piece of strong wire or something very small in diameter. Wet thistle is not appetizing to the birds, nor to me. It does not dry out, but clumps and rots. In additon, the feeder is very difficult to clean. If you already own one, may I suggest adding an umbrella baffle. Of course, you could always bring it in before a rain, or hang it under protection....."
1,Finches at our house didn't like this feeder,"For some reason, the finches we have at our house refuse to use this feeder -- even though they flocked to a cheap $5 tube feeder I had before this one! The other cheaper feeder had a flat tray on the bottom, which they seem to prefer over this design. I left it hanging out there for weeks and not one bird used it, so I finally gave up."
4,Finch Feeder,"A very nice feeder. Finishing putting it together was nottoo simple. The pegs and also the bottom tray took somesanding,etc to get it to fit. Especially the bottom tray"
3,Opus 7102 Finch Feeder,"Company is VERY, VERY quick with delivery. It wasn't the finch feeder I wanted though...feeder discontinued that I had wanted. Waiting for credit to my charge card. This is a very nice birdfeeder, howver I had already received a free one (similar) that was replaced through Opus's lifetime warranty. Very pleased to report..they do honor their guarantees..very quickly I might add."
4,"Hayden's talent is obvious on this, his second album.","Hayden writes and sings sweet, sad, insightful songs about simple everyday things or events that really make the listener think about them in a different, more meaningful way. He also uses a variety of instruments on this album such as the steel guitar and a beautiful piano/cello combination on ""Nights Like These"" to make his music more flavorful. Hayden is my favorite male singer, and I highly recommend both of his albums."
3,Just ok.,I found many of the translations into English from Russian to be inferior although pretty darn good [have native Russian fluency here]. Overall editorship and style makes the book feel disjointed and a difficult read. I give it 3 stars just for the effort of bringing so many cool [and often absolutely hilarious] Russian expressions in one book. I fault my curiosity for this purchase.
5,"One of the best , so easy to make and oh so tasty","easy to make just follow the instructions on the boxHowever, instead of water i use MILK , plus i always add a pinch of salt, freshly grated lemon peel, pure vanilla extract, pure almond extract , cinnamon extra , nutmeg extract .or sometimes , if i am adding rhum, i would substitute 1/2 of the milk with rhum ..U do not want to add more liquid because it is "" super Moist ""..."
3,Recieved slowly - Book Diirty,"I received the book, not particually quickly, but about the outside of normal. However, it was quite dirty - complete with cockroach droppings and trails thereof. HOWEVER, the book, with that exception, was just fine. Different pictures of some of the same people that were in my old one and definately some different newer poets, which I guess is OK but I wanted my old book and that what I thought I was getting. Not a REAL problem I guess. Besides, what do you want for a penny? Your money back? It is still a rather nice Anothology of Contemporary American Poets - signs of the 6 legged feed lot notwithstanding."
2,Leaves a weird taste and smell!,These are great for non stick but they leave a funny taste and smell on the baked goods. I rarely use them anymore.
1,unisa moccasins ->not for me,"pros: I liked the snake skin and the leather solecons: the shoes arrived with a stain on the light leather trim and the heavy stitching on the inside of the shoe protruded so badly that it hurt to even stand in these shoesCouldn't stand in them, couldn't walk in them and the pair I received had a stain-->this was one of the few times I had to return an item to Amazon."
1,A disappointing book,"The author describes himself as ""one of the world's greatest minds"" and his book as ""a profound personal account"" (rear cover). He may be one of the greatest minds of all time, but it is clear that this book is poorly written, haphazard in its range and content, and, in places, insufficiently researched and so inaccurate. Worst of all, the author puts forward his quite personal speculations about Chinese music as if these were proven facts. This could mislead the first-time reader.There is a lot of scope for an enthusiastic and inexpensive book about Chinese music, one that will help the non-specialist approach this fascinating subject. There is also a place for speculation in opening up new research areas, but a good author needs to exercise self-criticism, check facts through careful research (including reading the work of others), and avoid bombast. Mr Shen fails on all three counts. The cover is a very nice shade of vermillion, however."
2,"Weak motor,","This is a sweet birdbath. The solar fountain worked for a couple of days and then the motor died. I tried to get a new motor for months. When it finally arrived, it was fall. I don't know if the sun that hit the collector wasn't bright enough or what, but I couldn't get the fountain to work again, or maybe it was another faulty motor. I'll try again in a month or so."
3,"nice, but some problems","We've had the birdbath about 2 years. The birds love it. It needs to be cleaned weekly, but it is lightweight and easy to clean. The solar fountain worked for the first year. The turtles on the side break easily. One broke so many times there was nothing left to glue. I ordered new ones from the mfr months ago, but they still haven't come.During the winter we remove the solar unit and put in a heater. It worked fine last year. The last few days were unusually cold. This morning the top and base were severely cracked. The birds need water in winter, but this unit isn't the answer."
5,Using the power of the sun,We are thrilled with this bird bath. It has a solar power feature that we enjoy listening to the patter of water when the sun hits the solar pane. We also enjoyed the price which was much better than a previous bird bath we had purchased.
1,1 week later -- doesn't work,"DON'T BUY. Paid the price for this because I liked the idea of the circulating water in the birdbath. Unfortunately, the 'fountain' portion only lasted a week. Now it's just a regular birdbath with a big hole in the center where the worthless solar panel used to sit. Amazon shouldn't even be posting this shoddy merchandise which isn't at all 'as advertised'."
4,nice birdbath,This is a nice birdbath. It has a nice sound when the sun is shining but does fade when it is dull our or even if you walk past it or stand over it blocking the sun. It is not the heaviest of materials but was solid enough to keep from tipping.You must remember to keep it filled as the water does eventually evaporate.I intended it for the garden but somehow it never left the deck. I don't remember seeing any birds use it but I enjoyed sitting on the deck reading with the sound of the fountain relaxing me.It was not too big or cumbersome to move into the sunroom for winter storage.
5,FOUNTAIN LOVER,"This fountain has met all me expectations and more. It holds alot of water, so it only needs filling every couple days. It has a new electronic piece that helps it run on partly cloudy days. It assembles very quickly. I had it up and working in less than 10 minutes."
2,Not much intelligence in this book,"I have Gilson's book on Aquinas and have read it twice--many readers, some of whom must be conversant with Aquinas will recognize the lack of intelligent analysis in this book. Gilson'st overrated and lacks the critical acumen to make cogent judgements. Compare Kenner's books on Eliot, Pound, Beckett etc. and Abrams' two critical masterpieces. I strongly recommend that the reader ignore Gilson. That he is so popular with academics is yet another index of the lunacy of today's literary/religious/ philosophical critics. If only Mark Steyn could be persuaded to write some literary criticism, we could then have critical perceptiveness and fine writing to help us understand literary works. Gilson is pathetic."
5,"Not necessarily new stuff, but great fun.","I picked this up off a discount shelf (sorry, author) to read while I ate dinner while the fiancee was otherwise engaged one night. I ended up staying up until I finished, which wasn't long because it's a short/quick read.If you've already been in the wedding prep process, there's little new here. What this is, though, is a great comic look at the planning process. It seems everyone deals with parents inviting strangers off the street and the ridiculous expenses of planning--this book takes it all on in a funny, but mostly respectful, fashion.I'd strongly recommend this as a gift to any newly engaged guy or anyone getting close to the wedding date."
1,AWFUL SHOES!,I bought these shoes from another vendor online and they are awful. They look like two left shoes and they are severely uncomfortable. They are the most cement-like shoes I have ever stuck my feet into. They feel like you are walking in cement blocks.They are very poorly made to say the least. I would not recommend anyone to buy these awful shoes.
5,"great buy for sandro lovers, amazon = reliable","I got it within a week, hand delivered by some random dude who contacted me. The physical quality of the product seemed factory seal and had no visible deformities. The movie itself was master quality... not remastered but good enough to know its original and not Argentinean bootleg. All the basic information I needed to know was on the product details, however I would have liked to know beforehand if the DVD had English subtitles for my English speaking friends."
4,If you love Sandro you will love this campy star-vehicle,"Think of the Elvis movies and you will have a pretty good idea of what you will find in Muchacho. Except, the venue is Argentina and the star is Sandro de America. Sandro was a huge Latin star from the late 60s through the early 90s. It is a star vehicle without apologies. Argentina is the co-star of this Sandro flick which is true for all his movies (and he made quite a few). No English subtitles but the Spanish is delightful. This movie has a limited niche appeal but if you have succumbed to the sensual charm that is Sandro, as his Nenas and millions have, you will enjoy this steamy, silly boat ride."
5,Beastly Rhymes,"When I was a little girl, my mother bought this same book for me and I read it and re-read it until I wore it out. All through my teen and adult years, I never forgot these adorable ""play on words"" rhymes. The illustrations are amazing and so amuzing. This is a can't miss book for young and old alike."
4,Sexy piece of censorship history,"A reasonably good print of a not-so-good picture.Interesting as mainly the only historical documentwe're likely to have of the legendary Glenda Kemp -who, if you know anything of international obscenitytrials, was South Africa's version of Bettie Page.A highly moralistic young woman who just happensto like dancing naked with snakes in nightclubs.Plus Miss Kemp actually plays herself in the film,and does her own routines. How truthful she is inthe autobigraphical sense is hard to judge - sinceat the end of this movie (spoiler alert) she dies.Interesting acting choice, though, I must say."
3,Buy it at the local market for 99c!!,"Did you guys know that this product is sold at the 99c store?? I hope you are not buying it here, because the price is even higher than the regular grocery store that sell it for around $2.00 each! This is highway robbery! The cake is amazing in taste and texture though! :)"
5,The Meadow,For anyone who truly enjoys the most fresh methaphors ever written. The Old West in somewhat modern times--a delight to read.
5,Amazing-- one of my favorite books.,"This book beautifully weaves writing about the meadow between Wyoming and Colorado with the compelling stories of the men who live and die there. If you do not feel some connection to at least one of the characters in the book by the end, you probably have no emotion, as bold as that is to say. This book evoked so many emotions in me and I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!!"
1,Not a picture of the American West.,"Very dissapointed with this book. From other reviews I would have thought that this was going to be a great story of the American west. Not at all. It was very confusing & dificult to follow. The charachters, while modestly intriguing, were very very depressing and pathetic. I could not wait for it to end. I kept thinking I would find something to draw me in but it never happened. I would never suggest this as a read."
5,Intriguing look at life in the west,"I loved this book.Since I'm from southern Wyoming, the characters in the book reminded me of the independent nature of people in this part of teh country, and also reminded me of the lsot art of ""doing for ones self"".Although I normally have a hard time with books that jump around in tiome, I enjoyed teh eway the author wrote about ideas as tehy came to him instead of in time sequesnce. Great book."
3,Poetical writing but slow-moving narrative,"This book is about several families who have pursued life on a barren meadow on the Wyoming/Colorado border. It provides an intriguing look into Western character, especially of one man, Lyle, and the difficulty of life in this area. Yet the overly poetical writing moves slowly. Jumps back and forth through time and among characters make it hard to keep track of who is who. It seems the author has lived in the area since childhood, but he largely leaves himself and his opinions out of the story. The result is a dreamlike picture of a place, but not a well-told story."
2,Beautiful voice ... concept of CD suspect,"Me and my wife are looking forward to hearing Dessay inperson. Neither of us have heard her live or on CD.So, we bought this CD and listened to part ofit on the way home from an opera. We loved her voice.Not chirpy as some people have described her, but strongwith great control.But, we soon tired of it. It's like listening to someonedo vocal exercises. Great if you like that kind of stuff.Really dull, if you appreciate song and the craft of singing.We love listening to musical line and interestinginterpretations. You can't get those things from thisCD, well at least the first 20 minutes.I can't speak for the rest of the album because we switchedCDs in our car player to hear some ""Cosi"".I fault the producer of the CD. The great thing withshowpieces is that you always hold back until the greatestmoment of impact and LET your audience have it!No suspense here, no buildup, and from meno emotional response."
3,She's no Renee Fleming!,"Miss Dessay supports a wonderful vocal instrument in spite of her inability to craft a legitimate artistic statement. Subsequently, Vocalises portends varigated ornament and style over substance.Those serious enough to embrace musicianship at the highest level, should not resist familiarizing themselves with the finest soprano voice on the planet: Renee Fleming.Dessay's Vocalises is sung with undeniable conviction and fine lyrical interpretation. However, her flaccid timbre in the lower register compromises the integrity of her intonation and overall musical aesthetic.I recommend ""The Beautiful Voice"" by Fleming as the more prudent purchase, and far superior accomplishment in the genre."
5,BREATH TAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL VOICE,"The first time I heard Dessay was on my car radio, vocalizing ""The Nightingale & the Rose"" by Saint Saens. I was mesmerized. Unfortunately, when I listened for her name, someone honked & I missed it but by calling the radio station, I am now in possession of this fabulous CD."
3,Glossy but not great,"If you're a fan, you'll want this. It's a nice memento to look back on since George's death. It's slick and nicely produced. But if you're looking for any insight into the man and the player, this DVD will leave you short. The DVD is mostly a resume of George's time at Manchester United; it's not a biography. It's bolstered by interviews in the style of gentle reminiscences by old men in their armchairs with a nod to the fact that he was a bit of a lad without raking up too much controversy. There are 50 goals but not all of the best. Best was firey and passinate when he played; the DVD is gentle. After you've watched it, if you didn't live through the Best era, you'll grant that he was obviously a good player but you'll still be wondering what all the fuss was about."
5,son laughs every time he listens to it.,My son has wanted this for a while and I am glad I got it for him. He laughs evertime he listens to it.
5,"RAUNCHY, RAW, UNCUT, I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","LISA IS RAW, UNCUT, CUT THROAT, I LOVE THIS CD/DVD. IT'S GREAT AND FUNNY AS HELL. I NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD."
1,remember andrea dice clay?,"comedy central's self-professed insult comic lisa lampanelli's act reminds me instantly of an old ""in living color"" sketch in which kelly coffield appears as ""andrea dice clay"" (a female version of the much-maligned comedian andrew ""dice"" clay), brash and pottymouth'd and built to shock. but really she's only a meaner carlos mencia. people didn't understand that ""dice"" was a stage character being played by an actor, which leads me to wonder if lisa is doing the same thing or not. one thing's for sure in my opinion: it's not a radical act to ""be just as filthy as the guys are"" when you step into an arena dominated by males. women are smarter and should know better. that's why after hearing lisa's record i think she has more in common with condoleezza rice and ann coulter than any dirty male comedian."
4,a Wish book,lots of good ideas and detailed plans. Love the rustic style and these plans help fit it into my budget
2,use nails to join furniture?,"This book includes a few not-very-clear paragraphs about motise and tenon joints. Not clear? for instance, it does not tell you how to hold your rolly willow branches still while you drill. Other than that, it expects that you will hold your furniture together with nails, or sometimes screws. To my way of thinking, this is not really furniture."
3,Inexpensive and servicable,"I have used this item for several months and have found it to be servicable, However, since it is not made of leather it breaks and need to be mended."
2,Uncomfortable,Awkward fit and gets in the way. Cuts off blood circulation in tips of fingers too (and I have small hands).
2,pretty but didn't foil the squirrels- not a good buy!!,This feeder is very attractive but I found that our birds don't seem to use it as much as others we have. In fact it's still full after one month. That's plenty of time for birds to discover a new eating station. I was also dismayed when the squirrels were victorious once again. They didn't get through the bars but they did knock it to the ground and the [heavy duty] plastic broke. Oh well....
2,"birds use it to a degree, squirrels don't mind it","Not squirrel-proof, they hang down from the top of it,knock the seed out and feed to their heart's content. The ratio of squirrel feed to bird feed appears to be 5:1."
5,Opus 25112 Expeditions 12 Copper Fortress Feeder - Opus,I have had this feeder for over a month and I am delighted with it. It not only is functional but is very attractive. I will purchase another one for my grandchildren later when I find it available. Thanks!!!..
5,Citra Dish is the Answer,"I first bought Citra Dish to try something new from my local hardware store. Now that I've discovered it, I'll never go back. Thank goodness I can order it on Amazon! It cleans dishes extreemly well, without the gross cholrine bleach smell. No film. A natural foodie's dream assistant, Citra Dish!"
1,Not a happy user.,"I didn't have good luck with my Phonic 820. I did two shows running music for a choral group, but on the third show two of the tracks played from my laptop plugged into the Phonic came out slurred and could not be used. Thru the laptop speakers the sound was just fine. Not I can't trust the unit any more."
4,Great illustrations good poems,"Not very many good Thanksgiving books out there. This is one. I teach 2nd grade and am always looking for books to read aloud. The illustrations are small, detailed and need close examination so it is not that great for read aloud but great for reading to my own kids. My seventh grader and I still read it together every year. The illustrations are really great and tell a story on their own. I would like to see more from this author and illustrator team. ""Who said Boo?"" is also from them but not as good as this one."
2,Ummm...Why does everyone love this sucker?,"Why does everyone love this thing? I mean, I won it in a RadioU contest, and I listened to it twice all the way through. Then, I chucked it into the back of my closet forgot about it. Then, I see that Amazon has a perfect 5 star review?! It is so derivative and insipid and unispiring. All the songs sound basically the same; the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of Awake and Last Regret.Basically, this album is for people who call themselves metal-lovers or rock-lovers who really don't know what real metal or rock sound like. Go ahead and enjoy some completely uncreative crap while the rest of us listen to REAL music."
4,Good Music With Very Good Lyrics,"'Finally Awake' is a very good rock album.Many of the songs contain powerful guitars and drums with a rather hard rock sound. Some of the tracks are a bit mellower. All contain positive lyrics with a Christian theme.Seventh Day Slumber is never one to shy away from referring to God or Jesus in their music. This collection is no exception to that.Some of the songs that are very good include the following: Awake, Breaking Away, Undone, On My Way Home, and Every Saturday. I particularly like 'Missing Pages'.As an aside, if you have not seen this group in concert, they would be a great one to catch. In addition to their very enjoyable music, the lead singer, Joseph Rojas, has a very powerful testimony that will make an impression on anyone.I recommend this album. It is a good one for anyone. Harder rock fans will particularly like it."
5,Good receiver for the money,Bought this receiver for my xc90. Install took about 10 minutes and was very easy. No need to spend more money on the other brand receivers when this one works just fine.
1,Didn't fit,"After more than four hours trying to put it on, I finally decided it didn't fit. It was actually a little bent on one side with no amount of prying or hitting or cussing that could get it where the holes would even come close to putting a bolt through."
2,Interesting but a bit flat...,Manny tells his story about how Tony Robbins helped him change his life.I was expecting more out of this book and bought it out of curiosity.There really isn't much meat in it.
5,Wonderful Read!,"I spent time in the village of Huslia and actually taught in the school Jimmy started there. I met Jimmy's brother Sidney, who also wrote an awesome book, SHADOWS ON THE KOYUKUK. This is a beautiful, but harsh country where survival was not a given. This is a marvelous book..... unforgetable........ a must-read for a lover of adventure and the wilderness!"
5,Great reading,"Jimmy Huntington wrote the best read I have seen in awhile--not too flowery, just basic truth. I loved it!!! Bonnie"
5,James Huntington book,I really liked this book. Very good details on how he lived and got by through many types of weather and issues. I am really into survival books and this one was a good addition to my collection.
5,Excellent read,"For people who've been in the 'bush', this book puts you right back in it. A true testament of will and endurance. 'Jim' lived quite an interesting life. Loved it."
5,edge of nowhere,"i only wished the book was longer.the hard ships that the family went thru,the land they lived in so so cold ,barren.It takes special people to live like they did and raise a family..how they did was something you have to read...Great book.traveling by dog sled,the first man to win Alaska big race..how young the boys are when they run trap lines.i have 15 yr. old greatgrandson who read it and couldnt ,60dgs.and they went out ."
4,Great tribute song!,"I loved this song from the first time I heard it. It's great that all these artists from different musical categories can get together and make a wonderful song. I don't know how anyone can give this a bad review, this CD is definitely worth a listen. The original version is the best one on there. The only thing I can think of that I would mention is the fact that the Backstreet Boys should have had a bigger part in this song, lending their strong vocals more would have increased the greatness of the song."
2,Boy Bands and Crappy Pop!,"Firstly, I must say that even though the money goes to a good cause, I would rather donate my money to the Red Cross straight away than buy this awful cd. Pairing the likes of Fred Durst with NAS, and P. Diddy with Jermaine was awful! They should have had a ""teeny bopper"" version for the BSB and Britney fans, and let Mary J, Alicia, Nelly F, Bono and M. Stipe sing the song the way it was meant to be sung. Eve, Nas, Nelly hold up the rap section...who in the H##L told Fred Durst he could rap?????They could have done better or just as another reviewer said, let them donate money or show respect to Mr. Gaye, sing the song like it is supposed to be sung! Arent we getting tired of benefit songs and concerts anyway?"
3,Africa? What about AMERICA?,"While I applaud the efforts of these gathered artists, I simply have one question. Africa? What about AIDS right here in America. Yes yes, I know it's called Artists Against AIDS WORLDWIDE but the emphasis on the [...] web site is Africa, not to mention the african continent being used as a graphic all over the web site and it leads one to believe that most of the money raised will go there. We can't be the world's savior. We need to worry about our own problems at home, here in America.As for the music, it is just OK."
5,straight forward,"I'm a 1st grade teacher who is very interested in learning more about the science behind teaching reading and this appealed to me. I've read a few chapters so far.... She outright rejects whole language from multiple angles- there are some great quotes in here! She is very blunt but it comes from studing and doing her own research. It is a great read, although technical (there is a lot about statistics)."
1,Poor product,"The copy of the film on this DVD appears to have been copied directly from a poor print of the movie. There is no menu, no extras, and the picture and sound quality are poor. No artwork or photos from the movie are used on either the cover or DVD face. Not recommended."
1,funeral home,"the company did not send me an original movie instead they sent me a very bad copy of the movie that looks really bad when you attempt to watch it, i have contacted them thru e-mail and regular male and have not recieved any word back."
4,Review of Brassey's Book of Uniforms,"Rather than a detailed analysis or encyclopedia of types, this book takes a sweeping look at the meaning and making of military uniforms. Featuring color photos on the making of uniforms as well as historical lithographs, this book is a nice addition of any military history library."
1,Not worth the price,"These two authors write general books on various military themes. The publisher Brassey generally publishes various books on military subjects.I generally don't like this publisher as their books are too pricey when compared to other similar military books and the authors have done a wishy-washy job on the text, as usual."
3,"Shame, Shame on you.","This is actually a review of the reviews. It would appear that persons who read about revolution and guerrilla warfare are a bit illiterate. They seem unable to spell correctly, and have a problem with sentence fragments. Che would have laughed, had he been able to read English. Regardless, it takes very little education to fire a rifle, throw a Molotov cocktail or burn villages. Keep your soul, keep the peace."
2,How does it end? He dies.,"This guy was educated, but not smart enough to follow his own preaching. He separated himself from his popular base, communist/leftist college students, and went out to help aid the people. If he had paid attention in Guerilla Warfare 101 (read: On Guerilla Warfare by Mao Tse Tung) he would done more than fight in the wilderness.Guerilla tactics involve (as most everyone knows now) convincing as many civilians, proletariat or not, to fight by your standard. Che only became a martyr when photos of his corpse, incidentally posed Christ-like, were released to a largely Catholic public."
3,Eh...not the book i thought,"I thought that this was going to be a memoir of sorts with all the praise that it recieved, upon ordering it and reading it i now have in my head a university level understanding of guerrilla warfare. This is in no wa yshape or form is a novel or memoir or anything other than a text book written by a guerrilla mastermind. It gives you no insight to the author's mind nor any stories about his life or the war, it is straight up a manual for engaging in war. If you wanna read a book that has anything to do with Che or the cuban revolutionary war (other than tactics used) than i would suggest that you look into one of his diary's as I gave him one more chance with Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War by the same author, which gave me both a play by play and a little bit of what was going on inside the head of Che during these rough times, and was a really awesome book! Not a book i would suggest reading unless you plan on starting a war against all odds."
2,Don't expect too much,"The introduction to this book nails it when describing the text as more of a historical document and less of a manual to guerilla warfare.I understand the iconic stature that Che holds, and that this was brought about through martyrdom, but Guerilla Warfare wholly reinforces the adage of 'actions speak louder than words'; this book is dull and simple. It reads as if it was written by a stoned 10th grader doing a book report on the book I expected this to be, and it seems that 'revolutionary' and 'author/writer' are not interchangeable terms."
5,"Guerilla Warfare, an Invincible Tactic","Che Guevara's legacy will last a thousand years. His victory against the fascist and corrupt Batista, and his undying support of the underdogs, the peasants, and the tactical and ingenious use of Guerilla Warfare is explained in poetic verse in his book on Guerilla Warfare. His use of this tactic against overwhelming odds, places him as one of the greatest military leaders, in my opinion, he stands head to head with Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Napoleon."
3,Basic Tactics Peppered With Propaganda,"Interesting from a historical point of view. The tactics explained are very basic but would be useful for a rural insurgency. On a positive note, Che was very opposed to terrorism as practiced by his fellow travelers today.The constant railing against ""oppressors"" is tiring in light of how Cuba (and N. Korea and Vietnam and the USSR and...) turned out. History has proven his argument to be essentially - join me in fighting your oppressors and when we win, I'll stay in power and rule you with an iron fist for the next 100 years."
1,Warning this book is intended to make martyrs,"Guerrilla Warfare: Che Guevaraby Ernesto GuevaraWarning this book seems intended to make martyrsOver the years this book has proved far more useful to mislead potential guerrillas than to educate them. The handmade weaponry described are ineffective and or failed tools of war. The tactics suggested have led to defeat in the Americas and in Africa. The cause described has never helped the poor and down trodden. One could readily ponder if the real intent was to make martyrs for the cause of mythical communist paradise. One wonders how many, aside from the author, died violently because of all the above."
1,Don't buy this.,You're better off going to the library and checking this one out there. I didn't care for this book at all. Only good as if you want to build your personal reference books library.
1,Very funny!,"Very funny, this is coming from the man who said to Felix Rodriguez: "" I am worth more alive than Dead to you!"" If you want to know who this coward bubbling sociopath idiot was just reading Exposing Che, and Un Mito O Realidad and Shadow warrior. All these other books come straight from the Source: His family or extremely biased admirers. He was so good at warfare that he got killed because he couldn't even lead bolivian campesinos who were on the left. the irony is he became what he hated most: A capitalist Icon."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Che, an author on guerrilla warfare? Give me a break. The only military victory Che ever had was against unarmed men. Che, the master of guerrilla warfare, whose band of rebels was so incompetently led that in Bolivia the group got split in two and wandered around in circles for 48 days lost and even shooting at each other.Let's get real people. This book is just another in the long list of Che fantasy material published by Fidel Castro and his regime. Gee, that's the same as the Motorcycle Diaries and all other completely inaccurate tripe that is published by the Castro regime.This might as well have been written by John Lee Anderson, Che's greatest hagiographer of all time!"
2,Ken,"This a very basic description of Guerrilla warfare, it is also very dated.For someone just starting to study guerrilla warfare, I would reccommend it"
3,"Interesting, as a historical document.","I would recommend this book in a study of Cuba or of Latin American history in general. I would not, however, recommend this book for 'fun reading' or any truly useful insight into modern politics."
5,One of my top five of all time,"I've been an avid reader of modern poetry for 20 years, and Crunk's exquisite ""Living in the Resurrection"" is still among my favorite. He truly captures the place in which his roots first formed with a unique voice, both illuminating and as subtle as old whitewash."
2,Too much sexual innuendo,"When I read a regency novel, I want it to be as Jane Austen or Georgette Heyer would have written. Again, Laura Matthews disappoints with mention of 'loins' and feelings in the 'lower extremities'. We know that there are relations among married couples; but that's not what I read a regency novel for. I'm looking for historic accuracy, description of life in that era, and correct use of language (much of the language Matthews has her characters speak is quite modern would never have been said in 1813). This tale could have been enjoyable if she had stuck to the formula. I could not even finish this book, and it will be the last of this author's that I'll purchase."
1,CN911.exe infection,"I purchased 3 of these from another supplier, all 3 failed within a day, 2 wouldn't even start up, the 3rd had a trojan on it (CN911.exe) that tried to autorun. Fortunately I use Ubuntu and it halted the attempt to autorun from the mounted flash memory. The one that worked initially failed to start again after the second power up. Returned all 3 and bought 3 Hannspree frames."
2,Disappointing Film,"This film is constantly silly, but rarely funny. There are NO likeable characters, as the entire cast is made up of greedy, two-faced philanderers, with no puckish charms to compensate. I spent most of the film hoping that nobody would find the lottery ticket and everyone would die in a fire. I imagine this film was some sort of Depression-era wish fulfillment, but it left me cold and unimpressed."
4,An oldie but goodie,"I bought a 1998 edition used. The archaeological sites don't change much, so that was fine. It contains site plans, drawings and other information helpful in interpretation of sites. The Oxford series of Archaeological guides are well known as authoritative.I found this guide very useful in trip planning. Each site description included directions. This could be encouraging or discouraging about actually getting to some ancient sites. We're talking remote, in many cases. This guide is not about objects in museums, but about actual physical locations.The book has excellent lists of sites by region and by archaeological period. I found these features very helpful in trip planning.This book is a keeper. Will use for any future trips to Scotland."
4,Nice Microwave for the price,"I only gave it four stars because my husband believes it cooks bacon slower than our old microwave. I think it cooks bacon at the same speed. I cooked bacon in our old oven, two weeks before we got the new one. It isn't instantaneous in either oven. It takes about six minutes in both.The oven is attractive and because it's a medium size oven, fits nicely into the microwave stand we already had. Of course, I measured before I ordered it.We only paid $89 for this oven (it was on sale)."
5,Stylish,"I really like the look of this microwave, it looks classy. First you set the clock which displays a nice green color, its pretty simple, then put your food on the turn table and set the minutes that you want it to cook. Next set the power level 10 up too 100% then press start.It took 2 minutes to melt a block of velveeta at a 100% power level for our nacho's and cheese on movie night."
1,Nearly started fire...,"I've owned this microwave for over 2 years. It cooked everything well, is attractive if you're into the stainless look.Now for the bad... Stainless was hard to keep clean. If you enter the digits fast and then push Start, it will always add an additional minute. Very annoying. It overheated a few times. The last few days of owning this scared me. Whenever I'd use it, it would smell like plastic burning. Finally, the unit turned off as if it overheated. I unplugged it for an hour, then plugged it back in. No luck. I figured it blew the internal fuse. I took the casing off, and found the 20A ceramic fuse was still OK and intact. But, just to the left of the fuse was a burned wire. I was shocked!!!Do not buy this model! Made in China. Fire hazard!!! User beware!!!"
2,Great for a year then overheated and sparks flew.,"I won this microwave as a prize at work and ended up using it when our previous one died. It worked great for a year but then overheated after using it for 10 minutes 2x in a row. This was unusual. About an hour later it started working again, but the next day sparks flew out of it when I opened the door to start heating something. I don't know how much they cost initially, but if it's really cheap it's fine for getting a year's worth of use out of it. However, I wouldn't recommend it due to the sparks."
5,Happy Customer,"Very satisfied customer. Easy to operate. At first a little hesitant on the red, but I love the color. Does everything I wanted it to do."
3,Works fine but noisy,"When I first got this microwave it was dented and didn't work. It gave off a strange odor when I tried to use it. I sent it back and it was replaced without any problem. The one I have now works fine, but it is noisy with a machinery hum when it cooks. Other than that I have no problems with it. It has more power than my old microwave although it is smaller. I mostly use the microwave to warm things up or heat water so I am satisfied with it."
2,hummingbird feeder,I am not happy with the copper hummingbird because the top is not copper its plastic (copper colored).
2,Initial satisfaction; now disappointed,"I've happily used this elegant serving piece for a couple of years, receiving many compliments. I have put it in the dishwasher, but never put it in a microwave. It was room temperature when I put roasted asparagus on it [having cooked it on a rimmed baking pan], covered it loosely with foil and just before serving put it in a 200 degree oven to warm the asparagus. There is now a curved seven-inch crack extending from the rim into the platter itself. What a disappointment! I've Googled Cordon Bleu to see if I could contact the manufacturer directly, but to no avail. So...caution on purchasing this item, as beautiful as it is!"
5,great deal,"Simple install just a screwdriver drill and a 1/8"" drill bit. some buyers claim hard to slide apart at first.to slide- set shield down with the end which only has notches on the inside shield half of the shield pointing up,the outside half has no notches on this end. lift on the shield with the notch/tab by lifting by the tab while holding down on the outside shield half.do not force it slides easy. only tighten screws snuggly, dont over tighten or you will have to buy bigger screws to fit stripped holes.great bargain."
4,Works just fine!,"As well as being a real value compared to most other options to attain the same goal,this is made of a sturdy guage of metal, is pretty well cut and nicely finished in a semi-gloss black.I just mounted it today and will report on the effectiveness of its heat protection mounted on six inch single walled stovepipe.I may make some little cosmetic covers to cover the cutouts for access to the screws to finish it off. It would be nice if the vendor provided them. I suspect they could do so from scraps in the manufacturing process.On a whim, I also ended up using slight larger screws, as I felt it made the mount more solid.I am pleased so far."
2,Could have been better....,"I usually never feel compelled to write a book review, but this one has certainly motivated me to do so. It's an admirable book, especially since the West B is a specialized test. However, buyers should be aware that the included CD is rather shoddy. It contains only one full length practice exam, which isn't bad in itself, but it's the whole application that is poor. The answer check feature frequently shows explanations for questions that never appeared on the test, is out of sync, and also has some obvious proofreading errors. It's disconcerting to know I selected a correct answer, but the explanation chose an obviously incorrect one. I was rather appalled by this. But, to give it credit, I feel a little bit more prepared to take the exam now."
2,"poorly edited, not trustworthy of accurate scores","This book, while providing the information needed to study, does not do a good job of accurately recording your scores. Often, the questions and answers don't match up and it's impossible to know if you did a good job or not on the practice test. It appears the same problems have been in effect since 2006 showing that the product support on this book is non-existent."
2,Doesn't hold air,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. We promptly took it out of the package and blew it up. While my son was bouncing on it, air was leaking from the area where the plug is and it quickly went flat. We tried a number of options but no matter what we did, we could not seem to keep air from leaking out. The plug just could not seem to keep the air where it should be. By Christmas night the ball was put in my son's closet while we try to find a way to keep the air in. I (along with my son) were pretty disappointed in this product."
3,Keeps losing the air!,"This bouncing ball is very nice to play and inflates to a good size for a 5-6 yr old kid. Perhaps kids up to ~50"" tall can play comfortably with this ball when inflated to full capacity. It didn't take too long with a portable 12v compressor. However, the ball does not retain the air for long time. We need to inflate it almost every time you want to play with it."
5,Hopper ball,"Much smaller than I imagined. However, the grandson likes it. And turns out it is closer to a good size for him. Thanks"
3,Spongebob hopping ball,I did not know you needed a pump to air the ball up. It comes with an attachment for an air pump.
2,A disappointment,"This product was too small for our 4 year old sister. The child on the front of the box looks like he's 9 and it says for children 5 and up, but she could barely bounce on it, it was so small. She's used it, maybe, 3 times and it's now deflated because it won't hold air either. Wouldn't recommend"
4,The best darn mouse I've ever owned,"I've had this mouse for about 3 years now, and I have to say that it has served me well. I don't do much gaming but I do use the mouse to work in Photoshop, which requires some level of precision.Pros: Speedy response time, optical reliability, forward and backbuttons, useful scroll wheel, looks cool with my black case.Cons: Doesn't work at all on a glass desktop, 'alt-tab' button doesn'twork in Vista, finger prints show up on glossy surface reallyeasily.Overall: I love this mouse! It replaced my stock mouse on my lastcomputer and has stayed with me for this last system build.I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!"
4,Nice mouse some problems,"nice feel and balance, mine did break after about 12 months but thats some very heavy use... to be honest the mouse still ""worked"" but at detail work it had trouble sensing my movement. Switched to another logitech and put this one on an old PC still pretty happy with it."
3,"Great mouse, limited and simpleton software","I love the mouse. Well built, very responsive. Nice ergo. But ""performance"" and gaming mice should have highly flexible software. It is unforgivable that Logitech has continued to ignore the need to custom assign any button to any key or combination. This would be simple to do, just like writing a Mac driver for it.... I own an MX500 and I can't get over how great this mouse would be if I could custom assign buttons to more than their pre-canned options. 5 stars for mouse construction, but -2 for the software limitations and refusal to make it truly Mac compatible."
4,"Great Mouse, Bad Drivers","I got this as a gift for Christmas, and the mouse itself is quite impressive. It's tracking is superb, even on polished surfaces. The ergonomics are great, and the glossy finish feels really nice as well as making the mouse easier to clean. The extra buttons (above and below the scroll wheel) are a little difficult to press, but I think it may just take more getting used to.The problem with the package is Logitech's horrible ""Mouseware"" drivers. They are buggy, hard to configure, and have a horrible GUI. I had problems with acceleration turning off/on in games, which is really hard to deal with. I reverted back to Microsoft's Intellipoint drivers, which work MUCH better than Logitech's, but unfortunately they don't let you customize the 6th and 7th button (since no Microsoft mouse has 7 buttons)."
4,basic mouse with a perfect shape,"Over the years I've bought and thoroughly enjoyed Logitech's MX500, MX510 (in both red and blue), MX518, MX700, G5 (gen 1 and 2), and G7. All the same shape. I LOVE this shape. The 510 is a basic mouse, without any fancy features like a woven cord or customizable weight cartridges, but it's still a good mouse. If you like the shape of any of the models I listed above, and you get it for cheap, you'll be happy with this mouse. (but really I recommend a 2nd gen (the blue/black pattern, with restored 2nd thumb button) G5 instead)"
5,The Best,"I am a hardcore gamer. I sometimes play games 12 hours at a time. This mouse is excellent for gaming, I have big hands and it fits perfect. It is also beautiful to look at. I use a Func Surface Mouse Pad and usually use teflon tape on my mouse feet. This mouse feels so good I haven't even put any on yet.I like the feet, they are very small and there are 5 instead of the usual 4 for extra smooth sliding. The fact that they are so small will save on the expensive teflon feet tape too :)The mouse is very light, I really cannot find anything bad to say about it. The only thing in question in my book is how long it will last and it seems built well so I expect to be happy a while :) Highly recommended."
5,Great Mouse,"This is the best mouse I have ever seen.So far, I have bought three for my different computers and one for a friend. This mouse works perfectly, and tracks like a dream. I'm sure it's just me, but I think this mouse works better then the newer, more expensive MX518.Definatley buy this mouse, you won't regret it."
2,Right and left buttons do not hold up,"I've gone thru 2 of these already, the right and left buttons start failing after about 2 months if you game a lot. great handling mouse but it is unreliable. Spend your money elsewhere you have been warned."
3,Super Mouse!,"Great Mouse, just not ambidextrous. Took me 15 minutes, but now it's very comfortable : ) Very responsive, and cool looking too!"
5,Best Mouse I Have Ever Used - Period!,"The Logitech MX510 is a major improvement in ergonomics and precise control over my previous mouse - the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer.Initially, I was looking for a wireless mouse, but I was concerned about battery life and latency issues. I decided to forego the wireless options and am extremely happy I did.The mouse should be very comfortable for all right-handers with medium to large-sized hands. The eight buttons are easily customizable and are located in comfortable positions. The software seems solid, though I have not used it extensively.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this mouse and for anyone who needs precise control and does not need a wireless mouse, this should be their product.Finally, I love the red color - adds a great flair to the look."
1,"Three strikes, it's out","1) The optical sensor hole is so big it lets in tons of crap that you can't get out without tweezers2) The nubs at the four ""corners"" are poorly glued and come off, so that you have to either modify it, or deal with a much rougher slide around your smooth desk3) The Logitech Control Center panel in OSX 10.4.11 forgets the mouse is connected at least once a day, so you lose button mappingThe MX500 design looks slightly better in terms of the nubs and optical sensor hole being smaller, but it still uses Logitech Control Center, and I am leaning towards staying with the devil I know rather than possibly wasting another $40."
2,Scroll wheel broken,"For whatever reason, the scroll wheel stopped working about a month in. That's not a good thing, as a scroll wheel is extremely important for gaming. Dunno if it's an isolated problem, but I'm definitely not buying a Logitech mouse for a while."
2,very smooth tracking but extremely uncomfortable to use,"this is overall a good mouse with extremely smooth tracking and will be a superb one for those with big hands, not even medium hands would fit this mouse. it's really really bulky and hard to control. i usually play shooting and strategy games that requires a lot of movements and vivaciousness in my mouse and this one totally contradicts that. its also pretty heavy that makes web surfing difficult. therefore, im plannin on returning it to amazon.com and decided to get the mx310 because it fits my hand well and weighs less, the only thing i regret is giving up the 2 very handy back and forward buttons that the mx510 has."
3,A little warm,"I have stopped using it just because it causes my hand to get a little warm. I think, maybe, the LEDs are pretty strong in this mouse. I have gone back to using a roller ball mouse, though I miss the added functionality of this mouse."
4,Da Bomb!!!,"YOYOYO this thing is the bomb, playing FEAR with this was a snap, forget the laser mouses why pay more when you can get the mx 510 that works freakin awesome...."
5,An excellent mouse! Great performance!,"Logitech really do a good job on MX510. The performance of the mouse is excellent. It's very precise. It's great for people who like to play games and design graphics. Moreover, the mouse has a very good design. It's very comfortable. All five additional keys are extremely useful and save you a lot of time to movie the mouse to the back button or task bar.I have tried different type and brand of mouses. Logitech mouse is the best. It's a lot better than Microsoft mouse especially on functionality and comfortableness. However, this mouse is designed for right hand people. It might not fit for you if you are left hander.If you haven't tried this, you should try it. You won't regret this."
4,Better than the MX1000,"The MX510 is as comfortable and accurate as the newer MX1000, yet less than half the price. In fact it might be better a mouse: the mousewheel is much easier to click, the unit is less heavy, it uses the stable and proven Mouseware drivers, and the left/right buttons have a much lighter (but still crisp) click for less finger fatigue. The MX510 is sometimes promoted as a gamer's mouse, but don't let that deter you! This is an excellent, comfortable, high-performance mouse for anybody who spends a lot of time on the computer. I've been using one at home and may pick up another to use at work."
5,Great Mouse,The feel of the plastic on top of the unit is unique and the overall feel is excellent.I'm a hardcore gamer that has never truley trusted cordless mice and this is my overall pick amongst the competition.
3,"excellent tracking, but not perfect.","I agree with Kang here... the mouse has the most excellent tracking, but it was way too bulky and uncomfortable for me. I play games myself and am also right-handed. The main buttons and the mouse surface is made of this faux-turtle shell glossy plastic, which requires really really clean fingertips to not slip. I found myself wiping my hands and the mouse every hour.. I went back to my Dual Optical and I'm much happier."
4,Excellent optical mouse with accurate tracking.,"This optical mouse has accurate tracking. It can track well on surfaces where other optical mice would have failed. The extra buttons make desktop navigation quicker and more convenient. Because this mouse is chorded and does not require batteries, it weighs very light. Although the mouse is sort of bulbous in shape, it fits people with small hands. However, this mice prefers right handers because of the location of the thumb rest and thumb buttons. I think this mouse is ideal for people who do both office work and gaming."
2,Going soft,"Well, this has been the year for disappointing hardcore albums and this is no exception. Although this is an EP the first song is just a bad ""rock and roll"" song and the other two studio tracks are very mellow radio friendly songs. They are decent songs, but sad to see a powerful band writing slower and slower music. Oh well. I guess the prospect of major labels, MTV videos, and money have ruined what was once a vialbe scene. Buy this if you are a true fan of BSF. If not, save your money and buy something else. Note, only three studio songs, and three live tracks (2 which are off the last album)."
2,Going soft,"What a disappointing year for hardcore albums. Save your money and don't buy this. Unless you are a hardcore fan of BSF, the songs are softer than the last, going toward the radio genre. I guess with MTV, major lablels, and money the once vital music of the hardcore community has been pretty sad as of late. Not a bad record if you have never heard them before, however..."
1,the worst headphones ever!!!,"I hated these things! They had aweful reception every time i used them. Even when I was right next to my music player, I could barely hear the music playing. WHY DID I BUY THESE THINGS@ WHY! WHHHHYYYYY!!!"
3,Great book but...,Great book but I can't say much for the binding.Seems the publisher could spend a tiny bit for a binding that will hold the cover to the book.I purchased this book for my husband as a gift.First thing upon opening the book the cover came off. Not good!
2,"Short, too simplistic","The information in this book is in most other pregnancy books. It's also a very small, short book, so has much less information and explanation. In short, it says ""if you do this thing that you aren't supposed to do while you're pregnant, don't panic, but don't do it again either."" Repeat for each thing you aren't supposed to do while you're pregnant. I had been hoping for the reasons why you shouldn't panic, but it doesn't go that deep. If you aren't going to read a long pregnancy book this is fine, but if you are it is completely repetitive and not helpful."
1,IT'S RED ALERT....again...,"This game must be the worst of the Command & Conquer series. The story are so bad, you just want to put it away. Why did the allies want soviet to be their ally if they have no permission to build tanks??? Who is this Yuri-guy? The year is about 1950, I mean, comon! Mind-control? Wheater machines? Kane are not in this game, Nod and GDI have no connection to RA2. How can people love this game, it's almost an exactly copy of Tiberian Sun (wich were good, despite the graphics). Personally, I think WestWood (WW) should finish Tiberian Twilight (sequel to TibSun). The GDI-NOD conflict are mutch better and the units are more time-made. The story are also better (who Kane is? where did tiberium come from etc...). Now WW are almost finished with Yuri's Revenge, witch also will be dissapointing. I think Renegade should be playable, but you can only hope."
5,Great game,I loved this game as a kid and it was so great to be able to play it again. Can't wait to give it to my son when he gets older
5,Great game from the early 2000's,"Its an old game, but its perfect if you want something fun that doesn't take up too mauch space on a recent computer model."
4,"New, better, and easy","Red Alert 2 has everyting that everyone wanted in Red Alert 1. It has better grapics, a better story, and fresh units. Both the Soviet and Allied single player mission are great and fun with interesting twists. As usual Westwood Studios has given us a great game with a good backstory and bad cinemas (but since most people don't even watch them it doesn't really matter.) Yet there is one problem with this great game, it's too easy. If you start the single player missions on normal it can be challenging to beginners yet after a while it can get dull even on hard. Yet Westwood puts in a solution to that too. Since the game features single player skirmish battle and a wide array of multi-player games. It's one of the best RTS games I've ever played. If you're into RTS games this is a must have."
2,This game is lame,"... This game is cheesy beyond description, and I don't like that in video games. This is the first Command and Conquer game I've owned .... and I did not find it fun at all. It wasn't funny, violent, or amazing like many say. On top of that, the graphics are some of the worst I've ever seen. ...."
3,More of the same RTS we have had since Dune II,"Nothing special, nothing new, not a bad game, just very much the same game as any other given RTS. There is nothing new."
3,"Great real time strategy game, but...","Red Alert 2 is a great real time strategy game. There are two different people to play as, the US and Russia. The game is set slightly in the future, with realistic technology. Some of the missions take a long time to do, since Westwood didn't add a cheat engine to the game. However, the greatest downfall of this game is that it has no map editor. The possibilities of this game are not as great as other real time strategy games, especially those made by Blizzard. This game is one of my favorites, but after comparing to other games, it gets points taken off."
5,One of the best,Red Alert2 is and awesome game!It combines a good storyline with awesome multiplayer mode for tons o' fun!Although right now this game isn't the best(because Yuri's Revenge is coming out) the price has dropped and it's still as good as always.
4,Awesome game!! One of my favorites!!!,"This is one of my first CP games I have ever bought, I still have the same copy from when I bought it back in 2000, this game is so much fun! It's great that you can build and command your own army!! Note: if you buy this game, be sure to buy the Expansion Pack, Yuri's Revenge"
5,No bullying for Roxie,"Roxie and the Hooligans is a wonderful story for young readers. Although, I am an adult and I loved reading it.The descriptions of each character was hillarious. I especially loved how the Hooligans actions were described. Roxie's large pink ears reminded me of the story about an elephant named Dumbo. The stories describing Uncle Dangerfoots adventures were very easy to get lost in. The survival tips that her uncle put in his book that Roxie referred to throughout the story, seemed as if they could work in real life.This book is one that all kids should be encouraged to read, and I think that it is a great book for teachers to read to their students."
4,"Simple Read, Frightening Phrases, Fun L'il Book","My kiddo read this book while in the 3rd grade and enjoyed this book a lot, with some exceptions.It is a fun adventure book, but I'm not sure it'd be a challenge for anything past 4th grade. Roxie learns how to have faith in herself while the Hooligans learn a little something, too, so its a good lesson too.There are, however, phrases tossed throughout the story that are rather alarming, like when the kids hear the thieves will ""slit their throats!"" If your kid is sensitive you might want to read it ahead of time to see what you think.Altogether, its a cute book."
5,Wonderful book for standing up to bullies!!!!,This is an excellent book for young readers. It is a great tool for the topic of bullying. I recommend it for 3rd grade readers...or parents reading to children. It is very enjoyable!
3,"Lights, but other features do not work","I bought some butane at the local mini mart ($1.89), filled the gun (easy), pulled down the childproof pin (not so easy) and squeezed the trigger (moderately easy) and it lit. I fiddled with the flame controls (one worked, one didn't) and tried the hands-free feature (broken). Well, I can still use it for its intended purpose, so I gave it three stars. If I had to use it more than occasionally, I would have given it one or two."
2,"Not 4.75"" X 4.75""","I needed a large faceplate and this says it's 4 3/4"" square but this thing is actually only 3 1/16"" square. And this same model number is advertised everywhere as at least 4"" X 4"" so I don't know what the deal is. Maybe they're measuring the packaging or something. Anyway, I guess it's fine otherwise, it's just too small for me."
3,Interesting,Very interesting though not great by any means by this young composer. Ades has since composed what to me is some of the best 'new' Classical music. Have become a big fan of his.
2,Sorry folks,I do not see what all the hoopla is about. Is there really an interesting compositional voice here?
5,Emotional journey,"Since I have been unable to locate an address in which to write Mr. Garcia to explain how this film touched me, I thought this might be the next best thing. As a ""natural born"" citizen of the United States, I often feel overwhelming guilt for the suffering of the people who live in countries ruled by dictatorships and tyranny, while I enjoy innumerable freedoms here. Mr. Garcia has brought us a film that inspires hope, courage of conviction, and raises our awareness of the suffering still going on in his birthplace without bringing the stinging guilt that such a movie usually instills in me. I cried, then paced my apartment, then searched the Web for hours trying to find a way to contact Mr. Garcia to tell him that his message is received and appreciated.The story is so amazing, it is almost difficult to believe that Mr. Sandavol not only lived it, but managed to see his whole family emigrate to the U.S. Thank you, HBO and Mr. Garcia, for telling a story that deserved to be told."
5,"An amazing story, incredible music","This movie has all it needs to make it worthy of a spot in your video library. Wonderful characterizations by gifted artists, beautiful staging and scenery, a fabulous soundtrack, and a story that made me wonder, ""What do I hold so fundamental that I would be willing to risk everything to keep it?"" After renting the video, I recommended it to a jazz-music-loving friend, who, in turn, bought me the DVD for my birthday (knowing he can borrow it!). Watching it again motivated me to splurge on tickets to Arturo Sandoval when he came to our area, which was the best night of music I have ever heard. Each time I watch this movie, the story and the music move me. You will not be disappointed."
5,Truly music history,"Especially well-done and a great movie, but, even more importantly, it is a true piece of music history. Most people wouldn't know of Arturo's greatness if Dizzy Gilespie didn't help to Arturo out of Cuba...where they told him what to play. Very highly recommended. A must-see if you're into jazz."
5,A great musician,"I loved the story of Arturo Sandoval, his talent, his music and how he was able to leave his country and find a new life inthe United States. I have had the opportunity to attend several of his concerts. He is one of the best trumpet playersin the world."
3,For Love or Country - The Arturo Sandoval Story,"This is a good movie for a ""Jazz Lover"" to watch. The music is beautiful and the story has a little romance and a little politics. Not a movie great but nice."
5,Aturo Sandoval Story,This DVD movie was purchased at a very economical price and shipping cost. It was a great movie. We enjoyed it very much. The whole transaction was very good.
5,San Diego Chargers Classic Knit Beanie - Sky,Happy to be able to buy chargers stuff over the internet. This was a high quality beanie
2,Not the best resource,"While some of the pretest books out there are excellent for shelf exam preparation, this book is lacking in terms of how representative the quetsions are. The best resource for the internal medicine shelf in my opinion is the MKSAP For Students available in book and CD form from the ACP. The questions in there reflect the content and difficulty found on the actual exam. I scored well on the shelf using the MKSAP and supplementary reading on key topics like Chronic cough, asthma, CHF, COPD, DM, outpatient medicine, etc., etc., during the clerkship."
5,Great!,This book was in perfect condition and came early...couldn't ask for more :)I would get other books from them in the future.
5,Great Military Music,The CD was just what I needed for a special memorial tribute to our service people that have passed on. The recording was clear and bright. The music selections were well performed and TAPS was especially evoking.
5,Brilliant,"This is a wonderful collection of Sousa's best, and the quality of the recording is perfect."
4,No need for a hybrid!,"For audiophile Bill Evans freaks, this SACD is worth the extra money in terms of improvement in sound quality.It sounds deeper (even ""slower,"" an illusion of course) with less background noise. This is what DSD mastering does, often reducing the noise level less than what is contained in the decades old mastertapes.While I do understand the merits inherent in hybrid disks for new recording releases, there is absolutely no need for the CD layer, which sounds much inferior to JVC's K-2 coded CD. This can be said to all Analogue Production Jazz Classic SACD/CD hybrid series. Cut the CD layer and the sales price. Those who spend extra bucks to buy those classic disks know more than too well how musically superior those recordings are from CDs and LPs they own for years. You buy SACDs to listen to SACD layer, not CD layer, simple as that. Without the CD layer, this disk would be 5 stars!"
1,Thunder man- about his murder not the man,"I thought this story was going to be about his accompishments. How he designed an built boats an his involvement in the offshore boating community. His influence on 188th street and all that. Instead it's a documentary on how he was murdered and the evidence found regarding the trial. Sorry, I was diappointed. Could have watched this one on a mystery cable tv channel... not Speedchannel."
3,"Decent design, but there's a better choice.","The manufacturer makes this same design with stainless steel top, bands, and perches, which the squirrels have been unable to damage. The stainless steel is a lot harder and tougher than the copper. Removing the bottom tray makes it more difficult for the squirrels to eat, and hasn't bothered the birds. I've had everything from chickadees to red-bellied woodpeckers feeding from this feeder, with all perches full and a waiting line on the railing of my deck. Even the cardinals (for which the perches are really too short) have learned to use it. In short, the design is okay (certainly not squirrel proof), but I'd opt for the tougher stainless steel model. It may not look as nice to begin with, but it will last longer."
1,A waste of time,"This is nothing but a short .Misty plays a terribly mistreated wife who is about to have a baby.I often wonder why such material is produced as it has no redeaming social value.To take out Misty and kill her off in a brutal fashion and then take the pregnant body and place it behind the drywall to me is nothng but the product of a sick mind.Misty s short role shows that she can act ,something that we all know.The end of the movie had an ""alien "" twist to it so we have no new ideas presented here.All in all it rates a no star rating."
5,Deserves to go far,"I first heard this album courtesy of DJ Angola (NYC) who had been given it by a British contact, and had to get my hands on it immediately. Bought the import of amazon.co.uk in the end and having been singing his praises to everyone I know am delighted to see the album on general release in the States. I think Jack has a very unique sound and the resemblance to the Streets is fleeting. I love that he doesn't take himself too seriously, which is how I choose to interpret some of the cheesier lyrics...I highly recommend you buy this album. I haven't played it to a single person who didn't like it. It will be a great addition to your collection (get the version with the Lullaby/Snowflakes mix - as a huge Cure fan this was the icing on the cake!)"
5,Lots of power in a very compact design & price!,"Great hair dryer. I just purchased it this week so I don't know about how long it last yet. But I am very happy with the 2 speed and 3 heat options. The force of the air is great, it dries my hair quickly. The angle of the hair dryer makes it easier to use with a round brush."
3,HIGH PITCH SQUEAL HURTS EARS,"I bought this at our local Walmart for $12.87, brought it home, plugged it in and this high pitch squeal comes out, hurting my ears. This problem is not unique to this model or make of hair dryer. I should have tested it in the store to save me the time of returning it.The dryer itself is small, light weight and I like the sliding switch instead of push buttons. buttons. Having 3 heat levels is great in the summer, to cool your head after drying it on the hot setting. The color on the one I bought is black with deep purple at the switch area. It looks solid but all I did was plug it in. Once the high pitch squeal came out, I packed it up and am taking it back to Walmart."
5,Sesame Street Cake Toppers,"These decorated my daughter's first birthday cake very nicely! The bright colors showed up really well in pictures, also."
2,Did not get what is represented here,I ordered this CD and it arrived with 12 tracks on the first CD and 12 tracks on the second CD. I was missing 10 of the tracks that you see listed as on Best of Buddha.
4,Good concept for 3 year old,"Shipping was timely and product arrived in great shape. Our 3 year old grand daughter loved this product from school and now she is very happy with her own. Good product, fun, educational and a good value."
5,A winner,"Easily one of my two year old's favorite things. She would wake up and the first thing she'd say is ""play tools?"" It is colorful and all of the pieces work nicely. She likes to take apart the truck and the robot and sort the nuts and bolts by color. She even uses to tools around the house to 'fix' doors, chairs etc. There is a lot to do in a small footprint. Love it!My only criticism is that the nails fit in the holes without pounding them in, so the action of hammering is does not actually accomplish anything. My daughter does not mind that at all."
1,Disappointed in quality,"We bought this for our 2 year old son for christmas. Within one month the top part started chipping off. It has been less than 2 months and we have had to throw it away because it has become dangerous. The top peice where all the holes are is basically a cheap thin peice of plywood or veneer. It started chipping and then the chips turned into splinters. Very disappointed because essentially it was a waste of money. Considering it is made for toddlers, it should be made more durable. I wouldn't recommend this product at all."
4,Almost perfect,"This is a very nice, sturdy, all wood workbench that is our 3yo grandson enjoys. Because of the solid construction, he'll be able to play with it for years. My only concern is that the ""tools"" provided (also all wood), aren't actually functional--the little screwdriver blade doesn't quite fit the screwheads, the little wrench doesn't quite fit over the nuts."
2,Disappointing,"My son got this for a Christmas gift as he has always loved tools and workbench type toys. He was excited to get it and played with it a lot for the first few days.Unfortunately the set is not well made. My first clue came when assembling it and the pre-drilled holes for one of the legs was not spaced right for both screws to go through- I had to re-drill the hole to get it through. Starting within an hour of play, I've constantly needed to re-glue the tools and bolt together- I've done every single bolt and tool handle at least once and lost count on how many times I've fixed the hammer. The second day he had it the vice broke off with a splintered end from him tightening and un-tightening-he's a kid, it not like I was torquing down on it, it shouldn't break that easily.Workbench tools are fairly basic, and boys love them. However I cannot recommend this one as a good value based on the low quality workmanship and materials."
3,Bust a Tool Bench,"Great Concept, but give a kid a hammer....Pros: Working Vise, peg board, hammer & pegs, nuts bolts/screws. Cool. Smooth , no splinters. Son loved it.Cons: Within 2 days, my son hammered (broke) off a peg off the peg board--choking hazard for smaller children, tore off the working vise, cracked the screwable part.I should have gone with a durable plastic toolbench standby. Strong plastic is great."
1,1st one recieved broken,"we recieved 1st one broken and was to recieve 2nd one and never did, so i can't really give a review"
2,Not an exact match,"I own a 2000 focus and this kit is an ok fit , I had to maniuplate it to get it to fit right and couldnt use all of the components that came with it as with the instructions I could not use it when I followed them... will it work for you? lol well if your willing to invest the extra time to jimmy rig it"
1,Broken,"Item came broken and was just simply made weak. Went to audio store same day to pick up one, that one was broken as well, in the same place (the posts connecting top and bottom half). Best buy had the one that fits the 2004 ford focus perfectly, it is also a Metra but is made thicker and much better."
5,Great,This was the perfect kit needed by my son to put his new car stereo in his car. The price was perfect as compared to purchasing it locally.
2,"Works, but is poorly made","The plastic rails on the side are too thin and do not adequately support anything. I was test fitting the stereo in this unit and the rails broke as I inserted the stereo. I used super glue to reattach the rails, and they did hold after that. The fit in the car was good, it was slightly loose, but not sloppy. The pocket is of a decent size, it fits my stereo remote and an auxiliary audio cable. A small piece of metal to support the rails would really make this a worthy product. While I am currently using this product, I am dissatisfied with this product and will replace when I find a unit that is significantly different."
3,disappointing,"I bought a pair in the black. I thought they were going to have leather straps and leather wrapped heel, but if it really is leather, whatever the manufacturers have done to it make it feel like plastic. The cork is just like paper glued over another piece and on the pair I got, there are wrinkles showing where it wasn't glued properly. Otherwise they are cute shoes and very light weight. I will probably return these, but I wish you luck."
2,Husky Liners Custom Fit Molded Cargo Liner,"When searching for a product to cover from the back seat to the rear of 2003 XLT Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer, this product popped up as an option...disappointed that it only covered a small portion...(Site did not state that it fit behind a third seat that our Explorer did not have.) Gave to Goodwill."
1,Did Not Work,I put these batteries in my VTech phone and it is still not taking a charge. Did not cost enough to return.
3,Not As Pictured,"Received these batteries today and, although they seem to work fine, they're not GE as pictured. Rather, they're a no-name Made in China brand. Thought others might want to be aware."
1,There is no way i might order from this seller again,I did not get the batteries i ordered and the ones that arrives arrived new but were not of quality and died within 3 days
1,Doesn't hug the floor well - expensive,I guess i was just expecting something more durable and heavy duty (thicker plastic and better dust collection). Not sure what makes this a professional heavy-duty dust pan. Ordinary plastic dust pan. You can get a better product for 1/10th of the price from any supermarket. This cost me almost 10$.
2,It's not heavy duty,"It is large and I like the size, but it is not heavy duty at all. It is about the same as my dust pan I have, which was cheap one that I bought at a grocery store. I am very disappointed. It is big so it's ok for dry leaves and etc. but not for heavier garden needs. I am willing to pay more if it is really heavy duty. I didn't return because it was not expensive but i will never buy this brand."
5,BARGIN,These quickie heavy duty dust pans are excellent for outside cleanup and inside cleanup. Large means less trips to the can. Wish they would add the little sweeper to make it complete.
3,mica panel heater,Product worked well for 2 months and then quit-DeLonghi said to cut the cord off and mail it to them and they would replace the heater for a $15 service shipping charge. Amazon Verified Purchase
5,DeLonghi HHP1500 heater,"This is a great little heater. Since there is no fan, it is completely quiet. I had my doubts about heating the room without a fan, but no more: It heats up quickly and does a great job of keeping the room toasty!"
1,Piece of junk,"Delonghi is usually a star in the world of small appliances and space heaters. Not in this case. My warranty replaced heater just broke as well. That's right the 2nd heater I've had in this model is broken now too. They simply stop heating up for whatever reason. I'm incredibly disappointed. When they work, they're awesome. The price isn't worth their short life span. Stick with Delonghi's radiator heaters or get one from a different company. These are garbage."
1,Where's the heat?,Just got this thing and it barely gives off any heat. I got it because my old heater fan was going and thought it was neat this didn't have a fan but it can't even compare to my old heater that used half the wattage (and half the electric bill). Maybe if you had a tiny little bathroom this could do the trick but in my 10 x 10 office this thing does nothing unless you stand right next to it.
4,Looks and Efficiency,"I bought this heater for auxiliary heat in a 12x15 bedroom. It is perfect for taking the chill off in the morning, and on a very cold night can be run all night because it is totally quiet as well as having safety features such as tip-over shut off and overheating safety shutoff.I plugged mine into a remote device so that I can turn it on from my bed a few minutes before getting up!The slick EuroDesign allows this heater to be used unobtrusively anywhere.It is lightweight and the wheels attach easily with just a Phillips screwdriver, which allows this heater to be wheeled into just the perfect position nearby. The only drawback is that it is perhaps a bit underpowered. A unit like this which would heat with a touch more ""oomph"" would be perfection."
1,"Not GOOD! Broke after 2 1/2 months! Be warned, this product does not have a long shelf life!","I had this product 2 1/2 months and it just stopped working. Did I keep the box? No (should I have? yes)It wouldn't matter, you only have 30 days to return.Be warned, this product does not have a long shelf life!"
2,stopped working after 8 months...,this panel radiator works great... for 8 months. it certainly deserves 5 stars as long as it continues to operate. it comes with a 1 year warranty and i will be contacting DeLonghi's customer service to attempt repair/replace the unit. i'll update then.
2,Great heater. Short life.,"I ordered 4 of these and absolutely loved them. Silent, but they kick-out lots of heat. If I had reviewed this 1- months ago, I would have given it 5 stars.There is a down side however, and it's a big one. One year after buying these two have already died and one is showing signs that it has less than a week to live. A 75% failure rate in 12 months!? It's too bad.I have been a DeLonghi fan for years and this has been a huge disappointment."
3,May not be an energy saver,"This heater has the ability to heat at minimum power of 750W or maximum power of 1500W with a thermostat that offers 6 setting. It can also be wall-mounted or placed on a stand with pieces for either mounting in the box with the heater.I used it in a 332' square area at the 1500W setting and accelerated my light bill by an average of $25.00 a month. It did keep the area warm though the power consumption was a surprise.I had my first heater replaced under warranty after it simply quit heating and had no issues with warranty service.(Nov 08) I have moved this heater to an 8 x 10 room (with a closed door), have it set to minimum power (750W) with a thermostat setting of 3. The room is warm and the remainder of the house has a chill of 62 degrees. No noticeable changes with the electric bill at this point."
3,Under powered,I bought this product after it received great praise from Consumer Reports. I hoped the heater would heat an approx. area of 400 sq ft but it is simply too small to do so. I also have an oil filled heater which easily heats this area but I needed it in another room.Heater is just OK. Functions are simple but a timer would have been nice.Paid $40 and it is probably worth that to some someone heating up to 300sq ft.
2,short-term success,"I bought the HHP1500 Mica Panel radiator last winter and loved its even heat distribution and compact design. However, when I turned it on this year (11 months after purchase), I noticed orange ""hot spots"" on the panel. A week later, the hot spots have started throwing dangerous sparks. It looks like others have reported this problem with this appliance."
2,defective item received! do not buy!,"After carefully research the Consumer reports, I decided to buy this item. the shipping is fast, but the item is defective. after pulg in for 10 minutes, it will shut off automatically.i try to reach the constmer service by its hot line. it was always busy line. i was so disappointed with its customer service. after a lot of try, finally I got one person to talk with, and she believe my item is defective, and i should return it.quality of this item is not reliable, so do not buy it!"
1,does not live up to it's advertisement,the heater takes so long to fill the room and it takes a toll on the electric bitt
3,Room Heater rather than People Heater,"I had a quartz radiant heater before I bought this one and I expected the same results, but this heater gives out most of its heat through the top and therefore heats the room instead of what's in front of it.It has an option to be wall mounted, which is what I had planned to do, but the back becomes very hot and I wouldn't dare mount it next to a wall.I have it in my 12x10 computer room and it does a very good job of quickly warming the room since the room is small and I can close the door. When I'm in my open floor plan living room though, I use my quartz heater since it heats only me and doesn't waste energy heating the whole room."
5,DeLonghi Mica Heater,"I must say that this is the best heater that I have had so far. Prior to this I had a noisy ceramic blower, a radiant electric heater (quiet but dangerous) and this one. In my opinion, this radiator is quiet and extremely effective in heating my bedroom. At least I can sleep without the noise waking me up! The space saving design is another bonus. I am considering purchasing another one for another part of the house. Thank you DeLohngi!"
2,Disappointed with this Highly-Rated Heater,I bought this heater one year ago. We have been using it reguarly in the evenings this fall and it has been working fine. Recently it started sparking and shooting out flames when turned on high. Tonight it stopped working altogether. I would have expected more from a heater in this price range and with such high ratings. I don't think it is safe.
3,Not totally Silent,"I bought this heater to use in our master bedroom because it was supposed to be completely silent. It is, except for when the thermostat comes on and off. As the panel heats up and cools off it expands and contracts and the housing pops. If you are a light sleeper like me, this noise may wake you up."
1,NOT HAPPY,"The heaters came within 2 days after I ordered them. I open up the outside cartons and saw right away that these were used (not reconditioned or new) products. One of the boxes had a note from the previous customer dated Feb 2009, stating the heater did not work correctly.... My wife and I were upset and sent them back the next day 12/2/2009. I am still waiting for my account to be credited. These were supposed to be gift items.not happy in Lynn, Mass"
1,Very disappointed,I turned this on and it worked for a few hours then the room became cold and it never worked again. Not pleased with product. I am usually pleased by DeLonghi products; this one failed.
2,2 Stars for you,"First off, I did have the sticker problem. Secondly, I ran this for 6 hours in the garage to get rid of the smell. It still smelled once I had in our bedroom. I didn't use this long enough to see how well it heated the room, because I noticed our nice newly finished hardwood floor getting too warm for my liking. I don't want to ruin the finish or dry the wood out. Lastly, It was packaged poorly, our unit had a nice dent in it. So this is going back to the store. I can't believe this is rated the second best whole room heater by Consumer ReportsI have also tried the Vornado, which is very loud and kept me up all night, so needless to say it went back to the store. If someone knows of a good heater let me know!"
1,No thermostat!,"The description of this product clearly states, ""Adjustable thermostat automatically maintains desired room temperature"". However, there is no temperature thermostat. There is nothing but one knob for high or low power (1 or 2 setting), and a second knob labeled 1-2-3-4-5-6, 6 being highest. No idea what actual room temperature these settings translate too. I am very disappointed! I ordered this over a Honeywell electric silent baseboard heater because the DeLonghi description said it had a thermostat.It does heat silently and pretty well, but it had a large dent on the top of the unit due to poor packaging and delivery damage."
1,DeLongui HHP1500-not reliable,"I bought this heater last year in a desperate attempt to heat our family room in the basement. It worked ok, not very hot for one year. Recently when the cold hit the house the heater just stopped heating. I'm tired of buying unreliable heaters! HELP!Note: Last year when we were using it a lot, the eletric bill went sky high!"
2,frustrated,"I ordered this to be used as subsequent heat for my 80 year old mother. When I received the product there were missing parts and the unit was damaged however, it did work. I made arrangements with the seller to return the product and was given a full refund as well as not having to pay return postage. I decided to pay the extra money and have a propane heater installed which is working out very well."
1,Don't believe CR.org always gets it right!,"I purchased one of these on Amazon after reading reviews from Consumer Reports where they called it a ""best buy."" Not so. In less than four uses it stopped functioning properly - will not stay on for more than 5 - 10 minutes at a time, and has poor heat output when it IS on. I feel cheated. Save your money and buy a $[...] ceramic heater - it will work better and last longer than this piece of junk."
1,Not as Advertised.,"Do not buy this product:1) If you want to use in bathroom. Although description implies that you can use in the bathroom, the manual, and the help line, both state unequivocally that it is dangerous to use near water. Amazon should change the product description.2) If you actually want to heat a room. I'm amazed at how little heat actually comes out of this unit. As many have noted, sure, if you stand over it with a blanket to keep in the heat. But if that is the case, I would rather wrap up with my wife.3) Customer service was slow. Multiple calls and long waits.One star. Very disappointing. Sure, we kept it. I might be able to use in garage. Easier to eat the money than send it back."
2,Reliable and well built but weak and ineffective,"I have used this portable heater in my 20x10 bedroom for 2 winters because my room has no other source of heat. I use only the 750W setting and I have it on for around 6 hours a day. At this setting, I have to sit right next to the heater to get any heat; it mostly rises up. The heat is so weak that one of my legs is nice and warm while the other is cold. The floor 1 foot away from the front of the heater is warm, the floor 2 feet away is freezing. It does not heat well at all. I would never hang this on the wall; it would probably not keep anything warm except the wall. I give it 2 stars because it is reliable and well-built but I would not recommend this heater to anyone who lives in the Northeast who needs decent heat."
2,DeLonghi HHP1500 Does Not Last,"I've had two of these units. My decision to purchase the brand and model was based on the many positive reviews I read on Amazon and elsewhere on-line. This model heater gives off a good amount of heat and took up minimal space.I was very pleased with the purchases.After a little over a year, consequently after warranty, the first one began to spark. Of course this seemed dangerous. I deemed it a fluke - a lemon because it was an effective heater and I really liked it. I bought a second. It has been working well for 3 years. Sadly it died a couple of days ago. The ""on"" light lights up when plugged in but there is no heat. I would expect a heater to last more than 3 years. Needless to say I'm disappointed. I need a another heater. I'm switching to a Bonaire. We have one of these as well and it has been working effectively for 2 years.I would discourage anyone from purchasing the DeLonghi based on my disappointing experience."
2,Didn't Last!!!!,"I was so in love with this item, unfortunately it went out after 8 months. Not a complete waste of money, I suppose. It worked very well up until the moment it blew out. Don't waste your money if you're on a budget and are looking for an item that will last."
2,Worked great. Until it didn't.,"Like many others who reviewed this product, I was initially happy with it. it worked well and effectively warmed my home office. I used it for about 2 seasons and today it just stopped working. Dead. I'll give it two stars because I did get two good seasons out of it."
1,IT DIED AFTER 3 1/2 YEARS OF NOT HEATING ALL THAT WELL.,So far I have yet to purchase a DeLonghi product that is satisfactory. This item did not heat well. I had to put it right up next to me to feel the heat. And it has now died. Not a great loss except for the money lost.
1,Broke after couple years of light usage.,"This heater was quite satisfactory until it recently stopped working. We've only had it a couple of years, and used it only seasonally, so this is quite disappointing.We called the company and they said if we didn't have an extended warranty, there was nothing they could do for us.So if they want you to buy an extended warranty and it just quits working after a couple years, makes me wonder how good the craftsmanship is and how long any of these will last.Save your money and buy something with potential longevity."
2,WARNING*** Cord started to blister *** FIRE HAZARD,"Had this heater for about a year... Seemed to always work great... But this year, I noticed that when I went to unplug it, the cord was extremely HOT... I noticed that the cord was blistering... Super scary... Total fire hazard. Guess we should leave fashion to the Italians... and that's about it =/"
3,Worked last year... not this year!,"I used this heater last year, and it was quite good at heating up my bedroom, so good that I purchased another one for my living room near my work desk.This autumn I plugged the panel heater in, only to hear it fizzle pop, and stop working. The external light still illuminates, but the panel is no longer hot. So... for a long term reliable appliance, this is not good. But if you are in dire need of cheap heat for one season, this is a good throwaway item."
1,Great on warming - for a foot or two around the heater.,"As other reviewers did, I bought this heater because it was a Consumer Reports top pick. What a joke. I left the heater on for 6 hours in a closed (insulated) basement room and the temperature was barely a few degrees above the unheated space outside that room. Very disappointing, both in DeLonghi and Consumer Reports reviewing."
2,not as good as the reviews,this unit puts out heat like a radiator and it does put out heat. It just does not move it around the room like the other units with fans. I returned it and bought a lesco that oscillates and it seems to heat a room quicker.
5,very pleased,"I am using the heater in a trailer, with temps in the 20s at night is is working very well"
2,DeLonghi HHP1500 Safeheat Mica-Panel Heater,"This heater looks really good and is easily moved. It doesn't heat well. It has little power. I guess they were trying to be too safe, like everyone else."
3,Really Like Looks but Thermostat Sticks,"Best looking unit that I was able to find. It is a combination of radiant and convection heater so while is warming the room, it will ""throw"" heat to where you are.The rating was set to mid-level because the thermostat sticks in the off position. Resetting only happens after a hard whack to the unit. So I had to turn it all the way up to prevent the unit from shutting off and maybe not turning back on."
3,DeLonghi HHP 1500 Mica Panel Radiator,"It looks good but the function is not up to par. Heat doesn't radiate well, you have to stand right in front of the heater to get any feeling of warmth."
1,Do NOT buy Delonghi!,"Bought two of these heaters, both died within three months. Delonghi cust. service sent us a replacement for one- A $40 tower heater! Told us it was the best they could do! Never, never, never buy ANYTHING from Delonghi, they make junk! They will not refund our $$$, just stuck us with a cheaper junk heater. AVOID!!! I""d give the product one star and the company -1 star. How they can manage to stay in business selling such utter junk, I'll never know! This product has been discontinued by Delonghi."
1,"Great design, but bad value","The design, portability and heat output of this product is first rate. However, the heating element burned out in both units that I ordered over the past six-months. Never ran the radiator for longer than two-hours at a time and never at a setting higher than medium."
3,rating mica panel radiator,The size and style and light weight are all great. But I've found that the heater needs to be very close to the person and directly facing whatever part of you needs warming. I didn't realize it needed to be so specifically directed.
2,buy an oil filled radiator instead,"The heater arrived with cosmetic cracks. It was not packaged with an outer box....so expect some damage. Before returning it I tried it out to see if I wanted an exchange or refund.....I went with the refund. It gets warm fast but it doesn't heat a room like an oil filled radiator. It looks cool, but I was looking for ""feels warm""."
1,Already malfunctioning after two months of use,"Bought this heater in October, and already malfunctioning. Good while it worked, kept things warm like it should. Suddenly would start shutting down after ten or so minutes, unplugging or turning the unit off and back on did nothing. If it costs $80 some dollars I would expect to at least get a couple years out of it at a minimum. Returning for a partial refund."
3,Undecided....,"The heater worked great - the first three weeks. We noticed that it started turning off more quickly the second week (only heating the room for a half hour at a time) since the room was so comfortable when it shut off, we didn't think much of it. Last week, it stopped working entirely. We're going to give it another chance so we asked for a replacement not a refund. I'll update in a couple of months... or the next time it breaks down, whichever comes first."
4,Love this heater!,"I use this heater in my medium to large sized master bedroom. It has vaulted ceilings and is always a few degrees colder than the rest of the house in the winter. The best thing about this heater is that it is noiseless and doesn't glow. It heats the room quickly and has two voltage settings in addition to the heater dial. I keep it at the lower voltage setting. The heater is much more powerful than I need and I would cook if I kept it on the higher setting. The lack of timer is disappointing, but not that big a deal as I plugged it into an external timer which I bought for a few dollars."
2,Heats Fine When it Worked,The product did a wonderful job heating a very cold room but only lasted three months. Started seeing flashes and sparks until it finally shorted out completely. Would never buy another DeLonghi!
1,Died after only a few months,"I do not recommend this product. It was nice while it worked, but it died after less than 3 months use and I'm tired of constantly having to go through the return/warrantly process on poorly engineered electronics.My $30, oil-filled radiator may run hotter, but it will be working when I need it to be."
1,Great idea but poor quality,"Purchased two of these to supplement the house furnance. Like many I figured I would keep the house cooler and rooms we actually occupy comfortable. On arrival one unit did not have a functioning LED. Second unit's thermostat failed within first two weeks of use. Fortunately this was withing 30 days of receipt so Amazon paid the return shipping and gave us a full refund. So role the dice on this one, you may get lucky.....or not."
1,"I can't believe this product has ""Safe Heat"" in its name.","I just pulled this product off of the wall mount in my childs bedroom after seeing and hearing a spark/pop, followed by the strange bright orange glow commonly described by other reviewers. The back of the unit was very hot, which makes me nervous about having had it flush against the wall in a bedroom.I haven't seen any reviews about this product actually starting a fire, ... but I'm stil looking.""Safe Heat"" seems like a misnomer, and I'm glad this product is current unplugged."
1,"Bought 3, 2 quit working just days after the 1 year warranty expired","I bought 3 of these, to help heat my old drafty house. Yes, I put plastic on the windows, but zoned heating and modern insulation require complete remodels. When I dragged them out of the basement this year, 2 of the 3 heaters don't work. And just days after the warranty ended. :-("
2,"Worked ok, then just stopped heating. Any suggestions?","It worked great at first. It heated our bedroom like a champ. After about a year it just stopped working. The power light is still on, but it doesn't heat. I don't know jack about how these things work, so any suggestions would be appreciated."
5,Great product,"Absolutely quite, energy efficient and effective. Since we got this heater, we are really happy because it produces NO noise whatsoever, heats up the room real well, does not have a fan so the hot air does not get blown towards you, but spread out across the room evenly. 5 star product."
1,Don't buy it!,"Bought this just over a year ago. it just quit working all together. 2 days ago, it started sparking and I thought it was going to light the carpet on fire. then it quit on low. The sparks were shooting out of the heater. It was still working on high yesterday (only used while in the room), had the glowing spots like in other reviews, but still worked on High with half the output of normal. Today it quit all together. I would expect this from something cheaper, but for $90 I would at least hope to get a couple years out of it. It always popped when heating up, but when the pops turn into fireworks shooting out of the heater, it's time to switch brands.... Needless to say I will not be purchasing another Delonghi product."
3,serviceable,"pros:-heat is pleasant and warm if you're within 3 feet of the heater-wheels!-slim and compact-silent except for the slightly alarming cracking sound when you turn on the heater for the first time. this goes away, and eventually you can't hear a thing.cons:-no on/off switch--you have to pull the plug to fully turn off the unit.-only radiates heat to the front and slightly to the top and bottom. so if you happen to be sitting on the couch and want to feel the heat, you're out of luck and will only be able to warm your legs. this could be solved if they only added a tilt-fuction, which leads me to another con:-no tilting capabilitiesit does the job i need it to since i keep it close by, but i don't think it would work well to warm the entire room."
5,Satusfied with my purchase so far,"I bought this a month ago in Dec 2006, simple to operate and safe. I am satisfied with my purchase and surely recommend anyone even if one has kids at home. It heats up my living room (about22x22) in about 5 hours although I keep my home temperature at 67F."
1,Like the 4th of July,"I can't believe this product has not yet been recalled. I purchased it about 18 months ago and installed it as directed on the wall in my daughter's room. it worked fine at first though it did make small popping noises when it was heating up. Recently it has started making fairly loud poping noises and has a bright orange spot glowing near the center. Even worse, the unit is now the arcing and sparking. I'm taking it down and will likely throw it away."
2,3 out of 5 have broken.,"These heaters have a great design. They are quiet, heat a room quickly, and don't dry out the air as other heaters do. They just don't last very long. I bought five of them, three are broken. The construction materials are not as good as the design, and they are not repairable.I would like to buy this type of heater from a manufacturer that uses lasting quality parts."
4,DeLonghi Heater,"this is a very good room heater. It does take a while to warm up the entire room, but once it has time to work, it easily holds the temperature at a comfortable level."
4,Heat,"This was a good buy. Simple, easy to set up and use.Provides the additional heat we needed.Controls are on the unit. May want to consider the more expensive models that have a remote control."
5,Great,"We live in an old 850 sq.ft. apartment that falls short in the insulation dept. Running the baseboard heaters was like filling your gas tank this last summer. We bought this heater a couple months ago and mounted it to the wall and sometimes run a small fan infront of it to help circulate the heat around the place. Lastniht it dropped below 20* Although this heater is designed to heat about 200 sq.ft. it kept the main living space (about 500 sq.ft.) comfortable until bedtime, when we turn it down.JasenSeattle, Wa."
4,"Nice Price, Compact, Light Weight but........","This is a nice compact unit and seems to work well. I have it in a 16x24 room that opens to my kitchen, dining area and hallway. Within the 1st hour, the temperature rose 1 degree. After 2 hours, the temperature was still the same. This must be becuase of the adjoining rooms. However, my furnace has not turned on since I turned this unit on. Since it is a radiator type heater, there are no fans and is silent. This is a nice feature!The major downside to this, in my opinion, is that the face of the unit does get hot - too hot to hold your hand on. I have little children and I don't think it is a good idea to keep this on the floor with young ones around. It does have a nice feature to hang it on the wall, so this might be the solution. Good luck!"
2,Just stopped working,"I liked the quiet operation of this heater, but at just about one year old it suddenly stopped working. Never abused and only used sparingly to heat room when we were sitting watching television. We only had this heater about 13 months and used less than five months total. I will have to consider alternatives to this type and model of heater."
5,Excellent product,Increases room temperature without turning up furnace thermostat. I purchased this because it had a Consumer's Report #1 rating. Comfortably warm without drying the air.
2,Reluctant to get a third one,"These are great heaters, no doubt. But they don't last.Bought the first one from Amazon, used it for a several months but then it smoked. Literally, the element started sparking. It was under warranty so DeLonghi sent me a new one. Used that one for a little over a year and then it just stopped working. No smoke but no heat either, nothing.The last one wasn't under warranty so the bottom line is I bought a disposable heater that lasted for about 2 years for $90. I think I should get more mileage out of an appliance."
5,Excellent Heater!,"Great purchase! I use the heater in a large-sized bedroom, free-standing, not wall-mounted.Pros:-Keeps the bedroom incredibly warm, even on the economy mode.-Although lacking a thermostat, it is still easy to keep the temp in the room right where you want it.-My kittens love curling up in front of it and thus far have not burst into flames. Awesomely pet safe it seems.-Got it for a good price during the off-season.-Completely silent, great for cold nightsCons:-The back does get hot, but doesn't not seem to radiate a lot of heat. It is simply hot to the touch. Still not sure if I would mount it to a wall.-There was an initial smell, but having read other reviews and the warning on the heater, I ran it outside for a few hours and it has never caused any odors indoors.-Does not warm my soul during the winter of my discontent, but then again was not advertised as a son of York."
3,"Nice, but broke after 1.5 years","I really liked this heater, but it broke after 1.5 years, I used it for 2 winters. Then, it started making electric arcing noises, and I saw light flashing from the front of it. It was quiet (it has no fan) except for some occasional popping/expansion/contraction noises when it was cycling off (cooling down), but most of the time they were hardly noticeable, only once in a while would it make a loud enough pop that it got my attention, it made less popping sounds on the low setting than on the high setting. It is a sad society nowadays that products are not made to last long. It is now taking up space and polluting the earth in a landfill. I was going to open up the case and see if I could fix it but it has non-standard screws."
1,DO NOT buy this product,"I feel sorry for the writers of glowing reviews here-- because this product worked well for me too-- for a very short amount of time.First winter-- near silent operation mounted on the wall. Quiet, that is, unless we used the ""high"" setting. On ""high,"" the heater made loud and somewhat disturbing popping noises.Second winter-- loud popping noises even on low! And in the dark, those pops were accompanied by disturbing ""spark"" like orange glows on the mica panel. We had to discontinue use-- the child who slept in the room would wake up and cry when the heater cycled on. And the increasing visible spark-like lighting made me too nervous to leave it on, since that effect is not described anywhere in the product's documentation.Third winter-- it worked for about two hours, and then died. For good.Save your money. Buy a product reviewed positively by someone who has owned it for more than a month!"
4,It's still working during it's 3rd Winter!,"I bought this 2 winters ago and I love it. Silent operation. Heats small to medium rooms well. The only drawback, and I consider this a minor one, is it takes a little while to heat up, but once it's at temp it maintains it well."
1,stopped working,"We bought this for our family room (14' x 12'), and it never heated it adequately. We eventually moved it to the office (8' x 8') and it heated that room very well. After using it for a total of two winters, it just stopped working. Very disappointing."
2,limited life expectancy,"have used and loced this for 3 years and it just died on us. Delonghi offered no help, out of warranty and no repair available for 300 miles. Not sure I would but again, unless you like the disposable lifestyle."
2,Nice while it lasted,We bought two of these units. They worked beautifully until just out of warranty and both quit within a few weeks of each other. Not a good investment.
1,6 month life,"I bought this from amazon free shipping. Worked well for exactly 365 days then it died. tryed all the recomended resets to restart. Can't return it, warrenty is up. Piece of 90 dollar junk! DeLonghi products are cheeply made crap these days, mass manufacted by low paid laborors in china who do not care if things last. have to buy another product next year? More Garbage and waste. where has quality gone"
