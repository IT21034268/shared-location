4,My new favorite!,"I am really enjoying this workout! I only gave it a 4 because I wish there was a little more cardio but there is still a challenge. When I'm finished I really feel like I've worked but I still feel great. I love what it has done for my core, I've gotten a little smaller in the waistline and I'm more toned."
5,Birds and Boating,"Another great S & A classic, this time dealing with nature conservation. When Tom sets a noisy boat loose from its moorings in order to save a nest of Coot eggs, whose parents have been frightened off by the boat, he knows there will be trouble if the occupants catch sight of him, but not how much. A wonderful tale of boating on the Norfolk Broads with Ransome's usual blend of adventure and imagined adventure."
4,It works,"I had no issues. Though I have had mixed luck with Monroe, everything was acceptable this time. Has been on the car for 10 months with no issues."
5,Great Book for Girls of All Ages!,I just absolutely love this book and other books by this author. I think I got it more for me than my baby girl. I love it so much that my husband and me are buying for all the little girls in our family this Christmas.
4,Christmas gift,"We got this our 2 1/2 yr old niece. She was excited when she opened it and want me to read it to her, but then wanted to open her big brothers gift as well. My sister-in-law was pretty happy we got it for her because she had looked it over and thought about getting for her as well."
3,Kindle edition is dissapointing,"Got this for my 5 year-old neice. She loves the story. The illustrations in the kindle edition are black and white though, and pretty underwhelming. Book is very short - so with such poor illustrations and very little verbage, I feel like I got ripped off."
3,More a gift book than a reading book,"It's a nice book for a gift because it is visually attractive and the idea behind the text is entertaining. But there is one flaw in my opinion. There is no plot and very little text in each page, so in this sense it is suited for an early age, maybe three. But on the other hand the vocabulary is too advanced for this age."
1,DO NOT BUY ON KINDLE,"This is the worst 10 bucks I have ever spent at Amazon! While the real book is beautifully illustrated and very cute, the version I received for my Kindle was not formatted correctly so that the story didn't make any sense. AWFUL! I will be looking to get my money back for sure!"
5,Love,This is the cutest children's book! I love reading this to my daughter! The book arrived in great condition and was just like new!
5,Great Book!,Really cute book. My daughter (19months) adores it and is constantly in the 'night-time book' que (she chooses). We bought a second copy recently as a gift!
2,Red? Orange?,"I was expecting this color to be a tad more red than it actually came out. I have naturally blonde hair, but it still looked too orange for my taste. If you are looking for a more blood red color this is not the one for you! It's a good dye don't get me wrong. Just wasn't what I was expecting."
2,Doesn't last,"It was a very good color, which even covered my pretty dark hair, but it washed out in less than a week, even with shampoo for colored hair. Really disappointing."
4,Nailed It!,"Although I was never a secretary/receptionist, Cindy covered a variety of bosses and co-workers that I have delt with over the years. A must-read for anyone who is seriously considering becoming self-employed because this book will let you know how bad you have it working for someone else. As a professional voice-over talent I am sure glad I can work for myself!"
4,The Official Secretary's Guide to Sanity and Survival,"Cindy holds back no words when describing her actual life experiences working in offices as a secretary.Witty and humorous, you can actually read about all the personalities in an office and be able to match some of your coworkers and bosses with Cindy's descriptions.I really enjoyed reading this book, we've all been in Cindy's position at one time or another.A must read book."
5,Tell It Like It Is !!,"A Funny Read. Hilarious. I'm not a Secretary, but unfortunately I've worked for those ""different type bosses"" described. A Secretary's job is no ""piece of cake"" nor is it just a day to day, nine to five--IT'S A MADHOUSE! Cindy has unveiled the profession and exposed it for what it truely is--"
4,Feel Like I'm In A Fun House!,"I love the introduction, it really feels like you are in a fun house and carnival. It remindes me of when I wss a kid and went on a trip to PA. We saw a life like statue of a gypsy woman in a glass box and you put your money into a slot and out came a fortune. This CD took me back to a very exciting time when I was a small child."
2,Required Reading...For School,"I have had to read this book on two separate occassions, both in high school and college. I still wonder why. While it does give a somewhat humorous look into everyday life in communist Russia, the stories have seemingly very little significance (perhaps that is the point?). I have trouble finding this book's relevance to classes. I guess some literary works are timeless...this one is not."
3,TAPNSEE,"shop vac bag.IT FITS GOOD HOLDS QUITE A BITOF DEBRIE AND EASILY EMPTIES BUT AFTER ALL,IT IS A BAG"
4,its a vacuum bag,what can i say- its a vacuum bag-it does what it says and is a good value for the 3 pack. i dont feel i lost anything buying these rather than the high efficiency ones.
1,"I was going to buy, but I won't now.","""Vietnam - A Television History"" is more than a source of information about the Vietnam War, it is a fine example of early 1980s television documentary and provides insight to the thoughts of a nation when the documentary was released. Unfortunately, you lose that insight to early 1980s America by releasing an altered version. No material is ""outdated"" from a historian's prospective and it is a shame that the producers of ""The American Experience"" did not realize that before releasing this ""revised"" edition."
1,Chose not to buy,"I have an incomplete set of the original VHS edition and came here to see if the series had finally been put onto DVD. I am very disappointed to learn that not only has it been edited, it comes with advertising by sponsors not associated with the original production.I will wait to see if the original series is ever re-issued on DVD and will search for the missing titles of the VHS series on eBay."
5,Great reference tool!,"I had to rent this tape set for school as there was a college course on Vietnam, but decided to buy it instead! I am glad I did because I can pass this down to my daughter. It was an honest account of not only the war, but the history of the country as well, which I found interesting! Worth the money!"
1,PBS Diatribe,"Vietnam, A History: Not even close. This compliation ""documentary"" is no more than typical PBS diatribe. Very little if any factual information is conveyed. The only redeeming quality of this series are the film footages although these are highly edited to give the anti-American stances of PBS and Stanley Karnow.Is this DVD set worth your money? I am glad I borrowed it and not purchased it."
1,Won't buy it!,"I was set on purchasing this series. I'm currently listening to the audio book ""Vietnam, a History"" by Stanley Karnow. Have just begun, so I can't form an opinion yet.I was really psyched to get this series but after reading some of the reviews I think I'll pass for now. I find it ridiculous to recommend this series (as some other reviewers have done) while acknowledging ""minor' shortcomings, such as missing episodes and complete left-skewed presentation. How can something monumental as that be ""minor?"""
1,chose not to buy,"after reading the other reviews about censorship, i chose not to buy this series. too bad."
5,Vietnam : A Television History,"It should have been called the ""first Television War"". With television bringing the war home to the American people each and every evening, it made the winning of the war by our US troops very difficult.When will the American people wake up and understand that the broadcast & print media are socialists, with their own agenda.... unfortunately that agenda is directly opposed to the agenda of our elected leaders.Maybe someone will do a special telling a different perspective !"
4,caution about reviewer's advice,"This is a good video as introduction to the War.It could be updated based on what we've learned since relations thawed somewhat with Vietnam.Caution about one reviewer's advice to watch the Accuracy-In-Media rejoinder to the program:See it. It is horrible; the video pieces don't show what they say they do; Charleton Heston narrates a sappy poem about boat people; and the head of AIM later, when confronted with the shows innacuracies said that they don't matter --- all that matters is its anti-communist point-of-view. Some ""accuracy""!"
1,FOOLS! FOOLS! THEY ARE FOOLS!,I WAS PLANNING ON PURCHASING THIS DIRECTLY FROM PBS UNTIL I READ THE REVIEWS. TALK ABOUT CENSORSHIP! THOSE NUTS AT PBS ARE LOSING A LOT OF RESPECT AND A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM THE PUBLIC BECAUSE OF THE ATTEMPT TO LIMIT FREE SPEECH. I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD SUPPORT PBS IF THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE PUTTING A GAG ON FREE SPEECH. THEY EDITED A LOT OF CUSTOMERS OUT OF PURCHASING THIS DVD BECAUSE THEY EDITED SO MUCH FROM THE SERIES.
5,An Incredible Documentary,"Vietnam: A Television History is a phenomenal documentary on the before, during and after of the American War. 14 hours and worth the time! You can watch invididual segments one hour at a time.It's a remarkable piece for understanding this conflict. The video is rich with battle and geographic details...far reaching in its interviews of North and South Vietnamese as well as American voices...textured with information on virtually every angle (CIA involvement, the reaction in the U.S., Cambodia and Laos, etc.)...and told in a clear and gripping format. It explained a war I previously could not quite understand, and also provided a huge amount of information not found in most American shorthand retellings of the war. Hugely recommended for anyone interested in the war or interested in Southeast Asia."
1,"I came here to buy this series, but have changed my mind.","I came here to buy this series, but have changed my mind. 2 hours of original material missing? Forget it."
1,PBS Propaganda,"Although the series has excellent historical and combat footage, it is ruined by anti-American propaganda. The U.S. is portrayed as a loser, Vietnam Vets are presented in the worst possible light, and the comunists are constantly praised as heroes. Don't buy this set! Try instead Vietnam: The 10,000 Day War (not out yet on DVD)."
4,Loses a star for the commercials,"The eerie theme music that concluded each episode should be put back in place of the commercials. Since I do not have the original episodes I cannot make a side by side comparison regarding the editing and omissions on the DVD edition. That aside this is essential viewing for understanding the Vietnam War. Charges of liberal bias, and being soft on the communists are the same tired talking points that the reactionaries have used for years. Ignore them and watch this series."
3,Hilarious Climax!,"Langdon, often described as the fourth great clown of the silent era (after Chaplin, Keaton, and Langdon), can be a little hard to take. His characters are intentionally immature and ineffectual. But if you're patient, there's funny stuff here, and watch out for an unexpected slam-bang finale where little Harry is forced to perform a strongman act!"
2,No what the title says,"Disappointed. Sounds like there would be instruction on strength training, but there is not. And step-by-step makes no sense in relation to the video. It is simple a carido workout with weights. And it is ok as far as that goes. A lot squats and lunges, which was not what I was looking for."
3,work out bore.,"I thought this work out was a little lame. If you are a real beginner, once you have mastered the moves, it can start you on your way. But not for advanced work outs or real results."
1,Step by step strength training,"Disappointed. Only a few moves and too much repetition of the same moves in each of the sessions. So, the sessions are not unique. Moves are only repeated about 4 times before quickly changing. And, Petra Kolber is very annoying to listen to. Prefer Denise Austin CDs."
3,good for a beginner,"I purchased this video because I knew that I needed to add strength training to my exercise routine and I have chronic back conditions so I did not want to risk injury. As a person who is in my late 50's and exercises regularly, I found it not challenging enough. While nothing can take the place of a knowlegable personal trainer, this may be used for someone new to exercise. It is very safe and easy to follow. If you have been a regular exerciser in the gym or doing yoga or Pilates for at least 6 months, I would buy another DVD."
5,Great Weight Workout,"I love to do cardio but I've always been a bit intimidated by weights. Or more accurately, I've been intimidated by the weight room at my gym. So this DVD has been wonderful!Petra is a great instructor, full of energy and knowledge. (Something about someone with an accent telling you that you're doing a great job just makes it seem even better!)There are 2 (upper & lower body) 10-minute segments and 2 20-minute segments. Plus, there is a 5-minute ab workout. I'm not a huge fan of the ab workout. But all of the other segments are fantastic.The workouts are probably more for beginners through lower-intermediate. But it was just what I needed. I use 2 5-pound weights and some of the segments need a chair. Nothing fancy, just something to lean on.I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to start getting toned with weights, but is feeling a bit intimidated by the gym and/or weight routines."
3,Not really as expected....,There is really nothing wrong with this DVD if you're already into strength training but I expected it to go somewhat slower for people just starting out. At first it allows you to select your workout which I wanted upper body but it soon got into floor exercises so its much more advanced than what I was looking for. But I'll keep searching for that perfect DVD.
2,Good ideas...but that's it,"I gave this one 2/5 because it does have some original ideas, otherwise I would have given it lower. The movie has a great idea going...it's just not implemented well...or should I say, in a horror fashion. I know a lot of people in reviews like to say ""the ideas weren't implemented well"" but that's really the only thing I could think. Bulbous, protruding phallus members belonging to homicidal maniacs? Bring it on, I said. Unfortunately, this one has the vulgarity and nudity typical to most of my favorite horror movies, but not enough gore and too many alterations to make the reader try to feel the effects of whatever drugs these kids were on. So, while the film didn't ""bring it on,"" per se, it'll definitely be one I'll be thinking about in the near future...so I'll know what to avoid."
1,Chad ferrin is not The Greatest thing since Jiff,"Its funny just beacuase a director puts out a film that everyone in the genre loves (Easter bunny kill kill) then they think all of a sudden the guys a genius and everything he does is gold, I thought easter bunny was ok but it wasnt great, and it sickens me that directors like this get so much praise, i mean this movies about a mutated penis creature that haunts dreams it has no class, you may like this movie if you like penis..? but as a horror fan raised on Vincent price ect id appreciate that if someone is to be praised i dont have to see monster peninses in their films..This is John waters class."
4,horror to the max,"This is the product of someone's own twisted hellish nightmare. It's a collaboration of fear and total anxiety. The premise of the movie is a play on reality; some scenes are shot like a bad acid trip. The plot is intricate, creative, and doesn't disappoint true horror fans. Overall if you're a gore fan and enjoy broader line snuff films than you'll get your rocks off watching this indie soon to be cult horror film."
4,OMFG! Look At The Size Of That Thing!...,"SOMEONE'S KNOCKING AT THE DOOR, and he's got a battering ram! Dear Lord, this is one crazy movie! A group of med students experiment w/ a mind-altering drug, resulting in a nightmare of rape, murder, and hallucinations. Nothing can possibly prepare you for the purplish, hydrant-sized ""murder weapon""! Viewing this film may cause uncontrollable fits of laughter, mixed w/ projectile vomiting! Must be seen at least once before you die..."
1,"That's right, do not answer it.","Holly Mother of Mitra is this a big steaming pile of drug induced excrement or what?How I set through this is beyond me, I just keep thinking it would get better, after all there is plenty of sex and gore and more sex you don't want to see all mixed up in a big sorry pitiful excuse for a movie. Save your time or fast forward to the good parts because this movie sucks."
2,Anti drug statement,"It's so obvious that someone's trying to make a statement about the use of drugs,that I wondered if the movie was financed by the DEA.Two minutes of alright gore&shock;,but that's it.It's something you could show in schools to scare the little kids but it's NOT A GOOD MOVIE.Big regrets I bought this one."
2,Be My Love - Mario Lanza,"The voice came across ok, but some of the background sounds woiuld distort when played on my TV or laptop. Maybe I should connect my CD player to a stereo amplifier with larger speakers."
4,More of the same...which is good(ish),Oh all the stones of power books this is the one I like the least. The first three parts were excellent but then things start to decline into an ending that makes absolutly no sense. This happens sometimes with Gemmell's books his ending are not the best sometimes and they leave you with a rather strange feeling.
2,not one of his best,"David Gemmel doesn't do himself any favors with this one... that is not to say that its not a good story with action, violence ,epic battles and all other aspects that make fantasy what it is but in this sequel the whole thing is disjointed and anti climactic.I'm not sure what the author hoped to achieve with this one other than as a practice set for something better."
2,Too Small ?,"The text is on the lighter side. The volume is full of photos from front to back. They are all black and white with multiple shots on a line and multiple lines on a page. Each photo is a little on the small side. If you get the book to study the motion from frame to frame then you probably want something to help enlarge the page two-frames or more at a time.In my opinion the strongest point is that there are many different ""tasks"" sequenced using a variety of models by body-type, thoroughly illustrating ""The Human Body in Motion""."
1,The Human Figure in Motion,"Muybridge's ""The Human Figure in Motion"" is a classic. The frame by frame photographs of figures (male, female, athletes, children) are vintage photos from the latter half of the 19th century. They document action: carrying objects, a man jumping, child crawling, etc, as well as activities common to the time that are not evident in everyday activity now, such as discus throwing, fencing, woman pouring water from a jug, etc. These photos, although small, are still of major importance to the artist who tries to understand muscle groups for drawing the figure. Great resource book."
2,Better for smooth jazz fans than Marvin Gaye fans,"this is an ultimately unsatisfying release. Smmoth jazz grooves replace the fiery and sultry R&B passion of Marvin Gaye's music. If Marvin Gaye had been this bland and lacking in soul, he never would have had a career to celebrate to begin with."
1,Relational Communication,"I ordered the book in very good condition, got charged for a ""very good"" condition. The book was drop shipped from another company other than the company charging for the book and the book was in only ""questionably good"" condition. The packed invoice from the drop shipper also indicated the book was only ""good"" condition.Perhaps I would not have been so disappointed if I would have only been charged for a good condition book rather than very good condition. I feel I was bait and switched and ripped off."
4,"Great for the price, gets the job done","I was looking for the cheapest thermometer I could find that had a min/max memory. This fit the bill. It feels slightly cheap overall, but not so bad that I think it will break(and it was inexpensive, so no complaint!). It took a second for me to figure out, but it's got the external probe and a sensor on the unit itself, and both keep a separate running min-max record that is stored until you reset it. Some have complained about the fact that the probe has rubber insulation that may not be very thermally conductive but it seems responsive to me. I haven't tried it in water but it seems like it could work.I bought this to monitor the ambient temperature for my pet hedgehog inside and right outside it's cage and this worked perfectly. I gave it 4 starts because the while it functions fine, the quality-feel to price ratio was perfectly acceptable, but not 5 star."
2,Differences between the two sensor,If you leave it out on the table for an hour and then switch between indoor and outdoor the two temps differ greatly. It's depressing.
3,not accurate,purchased two. placed them side by side. difference of 1.0 to 1.5 degrees indoors. which one is correct? have tried them in several rooms with the same results -- different readings.
5,Inside digital thermometer,Great little gadget..my husband and I always disagree over the temperature...now we know exactly what temperature the room is. Works great!
4,Accurate for car. Poor 'backlight',"I installed this in my 2000 Jetta for an outdoor thermometer. It was easy running the wire through the firewall hole where the clutch cable is supposed to go. I first mounted it in front of the air intake on the top portion of the hood, but it picked up engine heat so I moved it down to the lower grill. It's now quite accurate."
1,does not work,"I bought this to track the temperatures inside my chicken coop. It was coming on winter and I wanted to see how cold the coop was getting at night. When I checked the HI/LOW it said the coop had gotten to over 100 deg F. That is impossible. Also, I tested it indoors with the external sensor sitting right next to the unit and the indoor/outdoor temps were separated by more than a few degrees. Also impossible. This thing is completely unreliable."
1,What a piece of %#it,"I just purchased the thermometer and installed it. It lasted about 3 weeks before the display went blank. I installed a new battery, it started to work again, for about 15 minutes and then the display went blank again. So now I am out my purchase price and without a thermometer."
2,MIN/Max function did not work,"This is a nice little thermometer for the price and seemed to display accurate temperatures, both indoor and outdoor. The main reason I bought it was for the min/max temperature functionsl which did not work. I contacted the manufacturer's tech support and, using the directions they gave me (which were different than the instructions that came with it), the min/max function still would not work."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this specifically to monitor the temperature in a room with computers to alert me to put on air conditioning. (I had no need for the outdoor feature and thought I could unplug the wire, but it is permanently attached). It has never given me an accurate temperature - and is off by about 5 degrees. It was a waste to purchase this item."
1,cheap. cheap. cheap.,Cheap product. The display only works on one side after about one month. Would not waste my money again.
2,"Works well enough for cheap, but probably not accurate","I use this on my nightstand to measure room temperature. The indoor and outdoor sensors end up just a few inches apart. I notice that the resulting indoor and outdoor are always significantly different; sometimes wildly different. Even though they should be the same. No, the instrument is not in the sun or under a light bulb.Also, the buttons are quite stiff.So I'm now shopping for something better."
4,Good Intro to Celtic Christianity,"This book delivers to the reader a wonderful introduction to the topic of early Christianity in Ireland. Not only is the life of Patrick covered, as well as it can be known, but also the world in which the saint lived. This is a murky period of western civilization for which little documentation exists. The author seems to make the most of available historical sources, if at times he seems to take liberty with them, e.g., filling in the gaps with speculative assumptions. His translations of the subject's letters are lively and entertaining, if a bit freer than the original (Latin) text allows."
5,A Magical and Poetic Work of Art!!,"I was shocked at how beautiful this biography turned out to be! I expected a lot of non-essential information, but there was a wealth of information on the real man who was St. Patrick. The author is a 'wielder of words' and really drew me into the life and times of St. Patrick. A lovely, highly-readable, and now very treasured book in my library!"
2,This Veo Webcam Will NOT work with Skype. Period.,"This was an OK camera way back when...and I do mean WAY back, like 2003. I've had this for years, but if I turned it on more than once or twice a year, that would be about it....until recently. I'm a latecomer to Skype, but installed it and found that this Veo stingray webcam just won't work with it. Thought about updating the drivers but found that the one I have, from 2004, is the most recent one available. Since I have a need to finally get into Skype, I will be buying a more recent model webcam."
2,PC Camera,Got the Item very quickly. But not very pleased with the quility.Can't get a clear picture.
2,just the basics,"If you don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a good choice. It gets the job done and the built-in mic performs very well. On the downside, the image quality is only average at best, with a low refresh rate, and poor performance in low light."
4,Great price and fast set-up. Great way to stay in touch!!!,"I paid $... for the web cam. Took about as long to get out of the box as it does instal. I'm Getting one for each of my friends and members of my family who own a computer.The pictures are a bit choppy, yes, and you need to have a lot of light to see anything, but that's my only big complaint... Also not really flat screen friendly, just a bit hard to find a place to clip (also comes with a flat base) the camera to the top of the computer screen..4/5 stars."
5,Clips right on to my Flat Pannel Monitor!,This is the coolest camera. It has a built in mic and this cool clip that attaches to my flat pannel monitor. I was impressed with the quality of the image too.
2,Not a good buy for use with XP,"Has a nice look to it, but with Windows XP that's pretty much all you get. I looked up the error message from installing the software and the site said the cam might not be getting enough power through the USB port, however, the camera heated up pretty well. So much to the point where I could smell it. Instead of tinkering with it further, back to the store it will go tomarrow."
1,poor,"There is much better out there for the same money. The Creative NX pro for example. Webcam is very sensitive to lighting conditions, poor with showing correct colors and hard to stay in focus. Save your money."
1,Piece of Garbage...Don't Do It,"Sounds simple enough...install the software, plug in the camera. Wrong. You name a problem you can have with your Windows system, this product finds it and pulls the trigger...from 'Add Hardware' loops to missing drivers,...etc. You name. It's like installing a car accident. Stay away. You've been warned."
1,Not a very good product,My husband bought this web cam for me for our anniversary. I was really excited to get it set up. I have had nothing but problems with the set up. All kind of error messages. I still have not been able to get it going. So I really do not know if it works very well or not since it won't install properly. I have never had any problems installing any products I have bought in the past. I am taking this back.
2,...And i saw Red...,"Bought this one about seven days ago, looked pretty sturdy, good base and flatscreen support. All drivers worked without problems, was able to do some video chat with friends via yahoo and messenger...HOWEVER, the video images it produces are VERY dark (even if you have a bright room) and very saturated in RED....Sturdy design, BAD video images... (i am sending it back..)"
4,Good Introductory material,"This book is not fantastic. However, given that material in this area is not plenty, it is the best I have seen so far."
3,finding a classic,"This book was recommended by jerry Porunelle as one of his books of the month. I had never heard of it, although I am a fan of classic science fiction of this period. The book is a mixed bag. It is a collection of 4 previously short stories wound together with a final section, dealing with exceptionally bright children and their mental and social development. Interesting social science, but the ending comes too quickly and too neatly for me. My adult daugher has a blog of science fiction reviews, and she reviewed this book after she read it too. [...]"
5,1950's Science Fiction,"Years ago I read the first chapter of this book, titled ""In Hiding,"" in a Sci Fi short stories anthology. A young boy, who is a genius, is quietly hiding this fact from everyone around him. His high intelligence is a result of his parents' exposure to an nuclear accident which, while giving him intellectual advantages, ultimately resulted in their deaths. He is then raised by his grandmother who does not guess his giftedness. A school psychologist figures out his secret, and the plot developes from there.The novel continues with their story as well as their search for more children like him. A private school is established where the students can work and create. Entertaining complications follow - personality differences, as well as addressing psychological, sociological, ethical, and religious questions - all done in what now feels like a refreshingly hopeful 1950's - early 60's vantage point."
5,CHILDREN OF THE ATOM,"First read this over 60 years ago---had been asked about my favorite books--this is one, the 2nd is THe Power--just had to get a copy of each for children and grandchildren to read (reread myself)--they still standup!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CHILDREN OF THE ATOM"
5,Monemental work in literature of the world politics,"This is a monummental work in the study of world politics. Those who want to go beyond text book knowledge of international politics should read this book. In it, Raymond Aron combines theory, sociology, history, and praxiology with profound insight and encyclopedic knowledge. Although his analyses can be difficult for American sudents far from 'philosophizing social science,' <Peace & War> must teach you how to think of politics among nations. Profound, brilliant,insightful, marvelously written, in short, this is the most important book in international relations."
4,Great mouse for the price,A very serviceable mouse. The only complaint is the that the click is not what I'm used to. Not as fluid as higher models. Feels stiffer. But it just takes a little getting used to.
5,Excellent mouse for the average user.,"I have had this mouse for a few months now and I am completely pleased with it. The response is excellent and has very fluid movement. The only problem I have with it is the range. My mouse sits on top of my tower when I use it, and for some reason that cuts the range down drastically. If I set it anywhere else the range is perfectly fine. This mouse take 2 AA batteries, and I noticed that when I take one of them out, the mouse still works! I find it very odd, but beneficial if I only have one battery lying around when I need a new one. Overall, this is a great mouse for someone who doesn't care about all the frills of expensive mouses. I recommend it to anyone."
1,Not a good product...,"I use this mouse at work with my new Dell pc and have had nothing but fits with it. Even though the Microsoft manual/website claims that this wireless mouse will work up to 10 feet from the receiver, mine quits working at less that 3 feet. I have tried everything. I downloaded the proper driver... didn't help. I have cleared everything off my desk thinking something was interfering... nada. So, here I sit with a wireless mouse that must sit within a foot or so of the receiver or the cursor starts to get a little sluggish on my screen. I definitely cannot recommend this product after the experience I have had with it."
1,This mouse should be fed to a cat,"This mouse is pure junk. I do a lot of click and drag on the computer and these mouse buttons are so hard to hold because of being so stiff. I would click and drag and let my finger relax and lose the drag and have to start over. It also did not glide smoothly while moving. Wasted $20. Bought a Logitec, and man is it nice! I do not recommend this mouse unless its the last one on earth. People who give good reviews on this mouse have probably never tried a good quality mouse."
2,Microsoft Revealed - user serviceable parts inside - reply,"I had the same problem as Gregory Alan Sweitzer with the intermittent scrolling and snipping the little tab fixed the problem. What's the deal, did Microsoft test one mouse, then say, ""Yep, it's good, lets ship em"". Geesh, that's pretty bad to have such an obvious flaw."
1,Nothing but problems,"I have now used this mouse for two days. It works perfectly for a while, then starts moving on its own all over the screen, clicking away. It opens programs, closes programs, opens and closes dropdowns, etc. Fascinating to watch, like my computer is possessed, but not something I want in a mouse. I am sending the dang thing back. I don't mind worrying about what my puppy is doing when my back is turned, but I can't worry about what my computer is doing when my back is turned."
1,avoid like the plague,"I've had nothing but trouble with this stupid thing, and in Brazil they don't cost only 12 bucks either. I thought by buying Microsoft I would have a guaranteed good quality. It freezes up, moves jerkily - in short an absollute disaster. Never again a Microsoft mouse"
2,Trackwheel will work (sometimes),The mouse is a good size and feel and is accurate moving about the screen but the track wheel does not respond half the time
4,Does what I need,"I wanted a good wireless mouse for work. I needed one that was durable, full-size (I'd rather not use a small ""notebook"" mouse all day long), had a scroll wheel, and didn't have extra buttons. I hate mice that have the thumb buttons mapped to ""Back"" in the web browser because I always hit that on accident.This mouse fits the bill perfectly. It's sized like a standard wired desktop mouse, and it only has two buttons plus a clickable scroll wheel. The only con is that it's fairly heavy, but I'll get used to it. I haven't had it long enough to evaluate battery life yet."
1,POS,"please spare yourself the pain of this mouse. garbadge*. constanly runnign out of batteries and runnig around the house looking for more. always spazing...if you move too fast, it goes the totally different direction and does circles and such. i would rather use a ball mouse. dont get me started about gaming! u would do better without a mouse than this in CS. please take my advice and get a mouse more than 20$ :)"
3,Microsoft Revealed - user serviceable parts inside,"As sold, the scroll wheel on this mouse has a cheesy feel to it and scrolling often takes two or three rolling clicks before the screen responds.Dismantling it, I discovered that the wheel has an inner hub with raised cams. A stationary arm lubed with white grease intersects this hub, creating the ""clicky"" sensation upon moving the wheel. I snipped off the arm, reassembled the mouse, and now the wheel moves as smooth as my grandpa on Ex-Lax. What's more, it fixed the problem of the screen not responding to wheel movement, which apparently was a design flaw related to the arm/cammed hub/clicky design.This fix doesn't address the stepped scrolling seen on the screen, however, but it is much more usable.I find it amusing that MS touts the smooth scrolling of their more expensive mice, when the jagged movement is caused by factory-installed parts that appear to be specifically designed to degrade the operation of the mouse."
3,Fixed my wheel,"The mouse is pretty normal, and inexpensive. The mouse is small for my XL hand size. I didn't like the remote receiver configuration, should have gotten one for a laptop. I totally didn't like the intermittent wheel operation. At first I thought it was my system or the internet. Then I read some reviews here. I took the mouse apart and cleaned the optical device (with the bottom of my t-shirt) and it is working fine now."
5,Just the item!,"Too many crybabies in these reviews... I just received mine, put the batteries in, plugged in the receiver. Then, as the manual says, I had to push one button on the receiver and one on the mouse bottom to have them talk to each other. And that's it. Good scrolling and clicking, no wire, and no more cleaning. I'm happy with it. If you were thinking of a wireless optical mouse for about twenty bucks, by all means, go ahead."
1,Poor Performer,"Two problems prompted a return of this mouse.1. very short connection proximity: the advert says it will connect up to 300 feet away. I found the mouse would not respond if it was further than 24 inches from the receiver essentially making it a ""wired"" mouse.2. scroll wheel functionality: a very bumpy, irregular response which completely fails after a few short clicks. I could depress the scroll wheel to engage the up-down screen wipe but couldn't train myself to substitute this action for good scroll wheel accuracy in moving up and down a web page.After numerous attempts to reconnect the mouse for better response, no luck, back in the box it goes.The mouse does respond on 1 AA battery. Impressive. I installed 2 to try to improve distance response. No help. No software comes with it for customization but you can get most anything done with Window's Control Panel mouse control."
2,Short battery life,"Maybe I got a bad one, but my batteries need to be changed monthly. I use the mouse at work, so it gets used 8 hours per day. Other coworkers also have wireless mice (different brands and models) and mine has the absolute worst battery life."
4,Happy Watering!,"I love my elephant watering can. For some reason, I expected a metal can, but this product is not metal. Which is actually good; it is not heavy. It is lightweight, easy to use, and terribly cute. It is just the right size for watering the plants on my porch and I am very happy with my purchase."
2,Not perfect...,"Got this on a whim for my wife and it's nice and cute and good for small jobs... but.The fill hole is on the forward portion of the forehead. So there's a fine line between tipping it to pour from the snout spout and tipping a bit too far and having water come out of the fill hole and making a mess everywhere. ;-) Not good... so I took a lid from a rubbermaid tub, didn't need the lid any longer, and cut out a round, a bit larger and glued it over the fill hole. Then drilled a new fill hole further back toward the handle thus solving the issue. So now it's just a matter of painting the glued on circle red with a white star and it'll look ""meant to be"". But only 2 stars when I have to remanufacture an item! ;-)"
5,Small Gem in Wes's Treasure Chest,"If this CD and the Misfortune book were the only thing John Wesley Harding ever did, it would be enough to label him a modern artistic genius. His wit and humor made me a big fan 12 years ago. Check out his CD's..start with ""Why We Fight"" or if you enjoy ""Songs of Misfortune"" try ""Trad Arr Jones"". He also has free downloads of music on his web site. Better yet catch a live show."
4,faux-lk,"A cappela madrigals about the unfortunate demises of a variety of doomed peasents. The songs are full of strikingly poetic betrayal, murder, forboding dreams, ghosts, stabbing, hanging. Lines like ""High above the wedding guests, he hung the ashes of her wedding dress"" and ""If he was fire, she must be wood"" abound.The ridiculous contrast between the sweet vocals and grotesque lyrics by itself is entertaining enough to justify buying this album."
3,"Many good songs, typical for 1965, enjoyable to listen to","Interesting as it does not have grace slick, but the tunes have a great rhythem, great vocals by marty balin, good work by jorma."
2,In it's entirety??? Not true!,"RCA claims this is the original LP in it's entirety. Let's look at a few things: ""Let Me In"" original version contains the lyric ""Don't tell me you want money"" instead of 'it's so funny'. This version of ""Runnin' Round This World"" is NOT the album version but rather one that has no relation [on the LP Signe Anderson sings lead] to the album, and humorously censored by RCA [probably 'just for authenticity to this disc...]. Plus, the lyrics to ""Run Around"" were different on the original LP as well. So you have 3 songs that have no relation to the original LP. However, we can't afford these $... pressings to hear these things [RCA obviously doesn't care, and still frowns on the lyrics,most likely] , so you should find a tape trader who can get you a tape of the original record. However, disregard the fraudulent claim that this IS the original LP. I myself would like to hear the original in it's entirety rather than a poor sounding,muffuled boot. RCA, do a better job....."
3,Good Debut Album,"Jefferson Airplane's 1966 Debut album, ""Takes Off"" is a sign of a very talented bunch of induviduals who haven't really learned to work together musically yet. All the right aspects are there- Good bass, good lead and vocals. It is evident that some songs were written to fill space on the LP, like ""Run Around"", before Kantner emerged as the lead songwriter of the group. Marty Balin, the groups founder, proves to do a great job of putting together an album for his newly founded group. To get to like these songs you have to spend time listening to them- ""let the sun shine through the curtains"". Give it time and you'll love it. Definetly not a bad album considering it's the head of the 50+ albums of the Jefferson Airplane family. Worth your time!"
4,"Along with SURREALISTIC PILLOW, a must-have!","Many people dismiss this album because of the folk-rock sound and the presence of lead singer Signe Anderson, who was succeeded by the more popular Grace Slick. But Jefferson Airplane's roots were in folk rock and here, they are excellent. My personal favorites are ""Chauffeur Blues"" and ""It's No Secret"". At times, Signe is better than Grace! They do sound familiar, though... It's also cool because the entire album is on the CD twice, so you can just listen to it in stereo, then in mono! Very underestimated, but WELL worth the money!"
4,flip-ups,Check your len shape and size before ordering these flip-ups to make sure you get the correct size for your glasses.
5,One of the best ever...,"Pure and simple, one of the best rock alblums ever made. It took me years to find it on CD... Slip this one into your car CD player on a summer day, roll down the windows, turn up the volume, find a place with no traffic...and just drive. It will transport you back to a better time. Craig is terrific on the guitar licks, Mickey and Grace sound great...and all the songs just rock. If you want to add Jefferson Starship to your CD collection, but only want to buy one alblum, this is it."
3,SARGAST501@AOL.COM,LIKE THE STONES THE JEFFERSON STARSHIP ALWAYS GAVE YOU 2 GREAT CUTS (IN THIS CASE STRANGER AND FIND YOUR WAY BACK) AND THEN A LOT OF FILLER. MODERN TIMES LACKS WHAT FREEDOM AT POINT ZERO HAD WHICH WAS A VERY FOCUSED PAUL KANTNER (POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THE RETURN OF GRACE SLICK. HE WROTE LESS AND TURNED THE REIGNS BACK OVER TO EVERYONE ELSE. I LIKE SAVE YOUR LOVE AND THE TITLE CUT BUT THEY ARE IN THE SAME BOAT WITH THE OTHER 5. THIS ALBUMS IN MY I-POD FOR LONG FLIGHTS BUT IF ITS A SHORT ONE FREEDOM AT POINT ZERO GETS THE NOD.
3,All the actors have seen better platforms...,"Cedric the Entertainer, Lucy Liu and Nicolette Sheridan have all seen better platforms, whether it's movies or TV shows that play to their strengths. This is a short comedy about a janitor who thinks he's a secret agent. The viewer is always one (if not two or three) steps ahead of Cedric in figuring out who is stacked up against him. It's not a total waste of time or talent, but probably not a movie you'll see twice."
3,NEVER GOT IT!,"The three-star rating is a medium point rating for the movie (to be fair), due to the fact that I never actually received it. Long story short...I ordered The Cleaner with Cedric The Entertainer but received The Cleaner with Samuel L. Jackson. I wrote the seller and about 4 months later was sent a substitute horror movie (approved by me). I'll order it thru another seller at a later date."
4,This is the stuff,"This movie is very funny. The promotion did not do the movie justice. It is right up there with the movie Friday. If you like Friday, you will truly enjoy this movie."
3,The undercover janitor makes good,"Not quite funny enough to be a riot, butthe amnesia from head trauma can't convince him that he wearsa red thong as underwear. He would like the superfreakblond security chief...Then there is the undercover waitress / FBI agentwho has been his sometime girl friend?The fat fellow in the end brains the bad FBI agent with a bucket.It isn't quite funny enough for some reason:Vin Diesel has changed our perception of what an 'agent'might really be like in the modern world.Code named Cleaner seem possible... and no joke."
3,pretty funny,"The previews made it look like it would be a good movie, though it was a funny movie, it just wasnt quite what I thought it be. It is funny, but isnt a movie movie I'll watch a 100 times, I 'll be lucky if I even watch it once, with-in the next year. This is worth watching but might be better if you just rent it rather buying out right........keith"
3,Underrated,"Funny, lively and sexy action - comedy - mystery - thriller. Likable cast. Intriguing plot. And a good girl-girl fight at the end. Yes, some jokes fall flat, but a good percentage of them work. Think of it as light version of ""The Bourne Identity""."
3,It was worth watching,"Here is a cute, if predictabel movie. Cedric the entertainer plays pretty much the same character he has played in just about every film he has ever been in. Nicolette Sheridan plays a role that reminds me of Sharon Stone in Total Recall. Lucy Liu plays a character who is easy to figure out right from the first appearance she makes in the movie. Still, this is a decent way to spend an hour and a half. The performances are pretty good and the plot is done in total fun. Cedric plays Jake who wakes up with amnesia and a situation. Is he a killer? Is he a rich man of the world with a beautiful blonde wife? Is he a secret agent or is he...? And what about his beautiful blonde wife? And is that waitress more than meets the eye? And what about the Holland dance troupe...What role do they have in this intrigue? Just watch it, figure it out, and have a few (not a lot)laughs along the way."
5,Funny,This is a really funny movie i saw it in theaters and it is definitely worth 20 bucks to buy this thing
1,Code name: The Minstrel,Pathetic The Entertainer is proof that you cant fix stupid. The movie about an average guy who thinks he is a spy is so stupid its shameful. There is probably one scene where he does this funny dance and thats it. The rest of this movie is chittlin circuit comedy at its worst. Pathetic the Entertainer is about as funny as the psychos who defend this clown with blind fanaticism. He is a comic not an icon so get a hold of yourselves and see this minstrel clown for the punk sellout he is and not the role model you want him to be! STOP SUPPORTING MINSTREL THEATRE!
5,"An expert introduction, but many developments since","Cornwell's details of the Calvi-Vatican worldwide fraud come from a financial reporter who understands banking and stock manipulation games - and the Vatican Bank, known by its cover name, The Religious Works Institute, was at the core of the operations, secretly controlling the shell companies and even Calvi's giant bank. The Vatican silenced the angry creditors by hush money payments and costs of over half a billion dollars, while harboring the bank's archbishop and his two aides from criminal arrest warrants for seven years. Only Calvi's death removed his personal testimony from demolishing the Vatican strategy. His family said Calvi was going to ""name names."""
2,One sided argument,"Provides only one side of why Montessori lessons are natural and rejects any idea of nurture. The language a bit preachy, but there is defiantly appropriate jargon."
3,Good material; Terrible binding of book,"The material presented is quite good, especially when used with the Teaching Textbook. My fault with it is the terrible binding. The pages were falling completely out before my daughter was 2/3 way through the course. The publisher should be ashamed of putting out such poor quality binding."
1,"The So-called ""Value Package""","The tools in this ""value package"" broke upon first use. They look good in the photograph, but they're of very very VERY low quality. Steer clear of this company.One tip of the watch band remover just broke clean of -- the steel is not tempered. The watch band link remover is a piece of junk: it bent and barely works now.Further, based on my experience with them, I advise all to stay clear of Watch Pavilion. I left a review of their very poor service -- and was then emailed by ""service at watchpavilion dot com"" with a very verbally abusive email -- by the company service department! -- calling me a name I cannot repeat here in this forum. It's a completely ridiculous company.This ""value package"" is, in short, a swindle."
3,Not Good For Magazine...,"I got a related model of this gun and the cocking thing you pull is way at the back, ineffective in wars. Mag fell out onto my porch, and the spring in it popped out. I'd recommend getting a rubber band to hold it if it falls out. but overall, if it would've lasted, it would've been great for sharpshooting. no reloads. Good solid FPS. Dependable accuracy. Other than the Mag and cocking bolt, it's a good one."
3,Lots of equipment.,I got a little bit disappointed with this DVD. I'm currently having prenatal Yoga classes once a week and bought it to give me more energy and sleep better during the whole week. This DVd requires more than a mat a pillow and a blanket and in my current class these are the only three things they require. I watched it one or two times and got demotivated after that. I understand that the instructor tries to keep every position safe with extra equipment but it still has lots of equipment that you have to end up buying.
2,So slow,"Before I entered my second trimester I was a runner and did pilates and yoga on a regular basis. I bought this DVD to keep active and prepare for labor, but I don't think I will be able to use it at all. It is too slow and there is too much explination (the instructor never stops explaining so you can't relax into a pose).This DVD will be great for someone who has never done yoga before or didn't work out regularly before pregnancy, not for somebody who was already familiar with yoga or in great shape.My biggest compliant is the extensive use of props and in between every pose you have to get up, get the props set up and even change position of your yoga mat!! I have never done a yoga routine before where I had to get up between poses and move my mat!!"
2,Too much fuss!,"I have to admit, I only tried one of the many yoga practices on this video, but I got so frustrated that I haven't even tried the others! For a 40 minute practice, the following ""props"" were required: a minimum of 3 blankets, 2 bolster pillows, 2 regular pillows, 2 yoga blocks, a yoga strap, a sturdy chair, and a wall that you can lean against and still be able to see the television! I felt like I spent all my time setting up, and very little time perfoming the exercises. I wish I would have been warned before I chose this DVD."
3,good for people who already do yoga not a novice,this is great video if you already do yoga and have the necessary equipment. if you are a novice like myself and do not have anything then it gets a little frustrating.
3,An Okay DVD,"This dvd is okay for someone who has been doing yoga for a while and has plenty of yoga equipment and space in the room they choose to view the dvd. You need a wall to lean against, a chair, several yoga bolsters, pillows, blankets, a strap, a towel. I feel like I need to bring my entire house into the one room. That part of the video is tough - you really have to try to find other replacements for all the props they use. I really like that there are tons of different videos to choose from. That part of the video is wonderful. There are so many problems pregnant women incur, so it is nice to have a variety of workouts designed specifically to many of those problems."
1,buy another prenatal yoga DVD,"Unless you like yoga that has no flow whatsoever. There is a cut (in the editing) after each pose, and all of the poses seem to require a lengthy set up with a multitude of annoying props. I was VERY disappointed with my purchase. Yoga shouldn't be this irritating. Try Gaiam's prenatal yoga with Shiva Rey."
4,A nice supplement,"I have purchased another DVD from this company in the past so I knew to expect that it wouldn't be as fast paced as some other videos. I really enjoyed using it on the days where I didn't feel that I had the energy to do a more intense workout. There were lots of props required, but many of them were ones you have around. She gives you lots of time to set them up between moves."
2,Prenatal Yoga,"I wasn't able to use much, it seemed to go way too fast for a pregant lady. I'm a beginner yoga person, maybe someone more advanced would benefit from this dvd more."
2,Not That Great,I found the tape very boring to watch. I was almost falling asleep from the monotone voice of the instructor.
2,Too much equipment!,"I was looking for a beginning prenatal yoga tape, to help with relaxation and stretching, and I was very excited when my husband purchased this DVD for me as a gift. At first glance this DVD looked great, with so many options directed at specific issues (like morning sickness, rejuvination, etc...). However, when I tried a few of the routines I quickly became frustrated. They required multiple rolled blankets, pillows, mats, chairs, wall surfaces etc... and even once I had the set-up complete, the exercise only lasted 3 minutes before another, completely different set-up, using different props, was required. Because I am new to yoga, perhaps my expectations were off - but every yoga class I've been to required minimal equipment, which is one of the reasons I liked it. I would not recommend this DVD unless you have a dedicated exercise space, as well as the right equipment and a strong previous knowledge of yoga."
2,Prenatal Yoga Complete,"I take a prenatal yoga class and bought this tape to supplement my weekly class. I find the tape very hard to follow and there are too many props (pillows, etc.) I would not recommend it especailly if you are not familiar with yoga."
3,Alot of Props and Choppy Editing!,I was disappointed when I tried using this DVD. I am Not saying that the Yoga was not effective or professional. I am saying that the numerous props (about 3-6 per pose) and the 'choppy' workouts (no transition phases between poses) were very distracting and burdensome. I normally never leave negative feedback. I decided to do so when I realized that with two children money can be limited and I wanted to save someone their money because there are alot better videos 'out there'. Good Luck.
4,definately one of the best theme's ever,"much like most of the reviewers, i saw this movie when it first came out and the soundtrack stuck with me ever since. i think all stops should have been pulled to make this one of the finest recordings available. as is, it's fine though. one of my only complaints is how short the soundtrack is. the movie is around 4 hours in length and the soundtrack is about 40 minutes. no matter, the exodus theme packs a powerful punch that has been recorded in a variety of styles from piano to jazz. the movie has been playing of tv a lot lately and i tried to watch it a couple of times. sadly, in my opinion, the movie itself seems dated and not very good, but the soundtrack shines on as an emotional highlight that one will never forget."
4,Raymond Redfeather's native american flute making instructional DVD,"I have used this instructional DVD to teach woodworking in middle school wood shop. This DVD is a well done overview of one way to build an athentic wooden indian flute. The only thing wrong is Raymond Redfeather advocates for, but does not display good shop safety while demonstrating how to make his flutes. I hope it becomes available again in the future as I have several friends who would like a copy."
1,MADE IN CHINA-DRY CLEAN ONLY-NOT SIZED RIGHT,"The bedding looks beautiful on the website, but I received mine today, and I would be lucky to get the comforter to fit a queen size bed, and its dry clean only which is not mentioned in the description. Its made very cheaply. Threads are sticking out all over and running in spots. Comforter is very thin...you get what you pay for. I am sending this back and purchasing something different."
2,Short-lived... but pretty,"This is a pretty set, and it is nice to have the curtains and all the throw pillows to match. But you get what you pay for, this is NOT Quality. I have had mine for about 6 months and threw the quilt out over a month ago because the material had ripped in Multiple places. The stiching and material is not quality. But for a infrequently used room, it is a nice matching set, just don't expect to keep it long if this is for your actualy bedroom."
4,That Little Voice Inside of You,"I thought this was a harmless little comedy version of ""Fantastic Voyage"", quite cute. Pilot Dennis Quaid gets shrunk down to be injected into a rabbit, but goofy Martin Short gets in the way of the hypo. So Quaid has to navigate his way around Short and make up with his girlfriend Meg Ryan at the same time, through Short. But there are nasty evildoers trying to stand in the way of all this getting accomplished, most notably Kevin McCarthy of ""Body Snatchers"" fame from the 1950s. He and his female accomplice also get squirted with some of the miniaturizing stuff, but merely become little midgets battling it out in a car. That was a great silly moment.Listen to that little voice, and laugh a lot at ""Innerspace""."
4,Another Winner From Joe Dante,"This is an updated ""Fantastic Voyage"" and interestingly done, I thought. Joe Dante directed a number of fun movies to watch during the `80s and `90s.Dennis Quaid stars and plays his usual cocky self. Meg Ryan is her usual cute-but-fluffy self and Martin Short is just plain funny - the best guy in the movie.The film offers a good combination of humor and science-fiction suspense. It's a fun movie. Be warned, though, parents: It's not the innocent Steven Spielberg ""E.T.""-like movie I expected because of the language and several sex jokes. In other words, this is not a kids' movie.It's hard to believe this film is over 20 years old."
3,mmmmmmmmmmm,i like this movie havent seen it in long time but it was ok watch but of course i am a meg dennis and martin fan sooooooo yea
4,Still a fun movie!,"I remember seeing this movie when it was first released back in the 80's. It was a clever and modern comic twist to the 1960's film ""Fantastic Voyage"". Martin Short was always very entertaining with his great comic acting and in those days Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan were a very ""in"" Hollywood couple with great on screen chemistry.This movie is a very entertaining, comic romp that keeps you interested. I highly recommend at least one view."
4,Inner Space : Height of Creativity,"""Inner Space is a creative film that combines romance, science, and imagination. Despite the fact that miniaturization is not possible with the present state of technology, this movie will have you believing in the process as an after thought. I was thinking about using this movie in my science class as a way to stir the collective imagination of students. It would help students write about themselves if they were miniaturized and introduced into the body. Martin Short does an excellent job playing a character that is comical yet serious. Dennis Quaid also plays an ex aerospace pilot who is a renegade cast away ready to redeem his career. The plot and characters really make this film a must see. I highly recommend it."
1,Did not work!,"They must have known I lived in the US, that's where they sent this item, but when I got the DVD, it would not work in my DVD player. I thought DVDs were universal, but I guess not!"
1,Not Funny or Insightful But Has A Few Interesting Special Effects,"The plot sounds intriguing but is not well-executed. I like my comedies to have more realism and a new way to look at things--this one seemed totally ridiculous and didn't make me think of anything in a different way. It was, however,very slightly interesting to see some famous actors' work from long ago, and Steven Spielberg's version of what the inside of a body looks like. Overall, I feel I wasted my time watching it."
1,I cannot watch due to wrong region,This disc is region two and thus I cannot watch it on my 3 DVD players.I'm not sure what went wrong but I can't use this item
3,Fun movie,A very fun movie that tells a great story. That is good and very enter taining. Love Meg Ryan whole looks very good and you see why she is so p;opular.
2,"Childish, underdeveloped, high-concept 1980s comedy","""Innerspace"" is a high-concept 1980s comedy - a man and his craft are miniaturised for scientific purposes - needless to say things go wrong.Sadly the many ideas in the film are under-developed and it operates at the most juvenile level. Meg Ryan lights up the film but Martin Short and Dennis Quaid are pretty lightweight. Also it's just not very funny. May appeal to young children. ""Fantastic Voyage"" it aint."
4,"Amusing , if nothing else","If nothing else, this movie's plot is actually pirated from old sci-fi, rather than the new (Matrix, anyone?). The visuals are very good, but the most enjoyable aspect was the superb acting. There are plenty of side-splitting moments where the comedy is achieved with sensibility rather than slapstick. A must-see, although in the later times this has become sort of senseless."
3,Not good.,"This movie is not good because it has no story, at least that would have been understandable if it was funny and believe me this movie was not funny. The reason for the three star rating is that there were a few jokes that were worth laughing at but I think it was still bad. If you like this type of movie then go buy the DVD but there are plenty of funny movies to buy."
2,Reference for an Imaginary Standard,"Html turns out to be two languages. There's html, a language that browsers display, and html, a theoretical standard designed by a committee, which no actual browsers display. If you're designing Web pages for people to look at, it's a reference to the former that you need. This book is not it.I bought this book because I want to make Web pages people can look at on actual browsers. Instead I find sentences like ""HTML 4.0 has standardized the many extensions and introduced new solutions. It's the browsers that now need to catch up.""This is a frightening sentence to read in a reference work. In fact, if you find yourself writing a sentence like this while writing a work of purported non-fiction, it's a sign that Something is Wrong."
5,Another fine OReilly book,"I am taking an HTML class and this book is a great reference, as handy as the online W3C pages, which I use regularly."
2,What's with the Kumquats?,"In deciding to learn HTML I purchased this book with my own hard-earned dollars. I didn't realize what a lame book this was until I later bought the HTML Goodies book by Dr. Joe Burns (Earthweb Press).HTML, The Definitive Guide is very stale and hard-to-understand. It uses the same example throughout the book.Dr. Joe's HTML Goodies book is actually enjoyable to read and gives real-world examples of what you can and cannot do with HTML. I'm on my way now."
2,Messy.,"This is not what I would call a hopeless book, but it could definitely be improved. There are almost no helpful examples, and when there is an example (usually on Kumquats) it is not straightforeward. I am all for complex and non-straightforward examples, but only after a more simple example which clearly illustrates the ideas being discussed. The section on tables is one such instance of poor presentation making use of a rather none straightforward table as an introduction."
1,This book can not be read,The organization and redundacy in this book as it attemps to be both a primer and a refercerence book make it unreadable. This latest version has just a few but apparently hastily added changes from the previous edition. If you need to know about XHTML go elsewhere...
5,Excellent!,"This book emphasizes a careful and methodical approach to authoring HTML. Characteristic of O'Reilly books, its academic style of writing is clear and elegant, evident in the level of comprehension gained at the end of each chapter (it is completely free of stupid analogies that seem to pervade many technical books). The ""shorthand, quick-reference definition"" boxes are unique and resourceful. In short, this is an outstanding publication."
2,Not a good reference,"I have bought this book and as someone who knows already HTML I do not find it useful at all.Eventhough it tells you if attributes are supported by certain browsers, it does not tell you which of them.On top of that the ""tips"" that it gives are merely basic rules of HTML.If you want a good reference book try: Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference or Web Design in a Nutshell. Both of them succed in describing attributes and tags: they tell you which are supported and explain them clearly."
2,Good reviews; mediocre book,"All these glowing reviews really makes me wonder? I'm scratching my head trying to figure out why. The book is mediocre at best. Sure O'Reilly books are ""supposed"" to be the premiere tech authority but are they really? Is this book ""really"" that good?Did the authors plant these good reviews? Somethings fishy and I'd like to know what it is.I read this book. It is a rather ordinary reference book. The text is dry. Really dry. I think there are many other books that are much better."
1,Read only under duress,"A rehash of the previous edition with very minor changes and more errors. The changes seem to have introduced a new set of errors instead of making the book better. This book is almost impossible to read because of the organization and redundancy included as it attempts to also be a reference book. Unfortunately it succeeds neither as a primer nor as a reference book.This book, is not what you want if you want to learn HTML & XHTML. [...]"
4,"Very Good for Begienrs, not thorough!","I bought this book two months ago. As a beginner, I found it very easy to understand and to master the basic structure and basic syntax, however, when I finish reading this book and ready to put it into practice, I found that this book lacks more details about the Cascading Style Sheet and some other useful tags. In fact, I learned more things from Webmonkey about the CSS rather than in Chapter 9 in HTML Definitive Guide. Anyway, it is a book for Freshman who wish to learn HTML."
2,Looking for a good reference book?,Well if you are looking for a reference book this is not it. HTML: The Definitive Guide simply does not have what it takes. As a reference for professionals it comes up short. Dry. Poor examples. Boring. Not extensive. I firmly believe that anyone who needs a reference book should look to Web Publishing Unleashed Professional Reference. As the title implies Web Publishing Unleashed Professional Reference is a reference book for working professionals. Check it out I think you will agree
3,A somewhat useful treatment of HTML BUT,"nothing special. Consider this book because it is bargain priced, but then find a serious book that will teach you what you really need to know"
4,"Excellent Book, but already outdated! A 2nd Edition is out.","I bought and use this book, and am looking forward to the second edition, which I've read has hit the bookstores"
1,"As the title says, this is the DEFINITIVE guide to HTML.","There are plenty of web-links and books on HTML but none isas ""definitive"" as this book. It's highly readable cover-to-cover and just as valuable as a reference -- read a chapter here and a page there. Plenty of examples, plenty of illustrations: the book covers every aspect of the current HMTL 2.0 specification (and explains why there is not a 3.0 standard, no matter what others say). I especially was appreciative of the authors' reminders to set up web pages readable by any browser (not only Netscape and MS' I.E.) including Lynx, a text-only browser I still like to use."
5,A great HTML text,"This book is a very good treatise on the basic HTML language. Web design novices will be able to easily learn the language, while already experienced designers will learn things they never knew before and have an essential reference book. Each HTML tag is clearly explained with a thorough description of all its properties. Proper HTML coding and the use of content-based structure are strongly encouraged. One word of warning: The chapter on style sheets is very rushed and may be difficult for a novice to comprehend. If you wish to learn style sheets, I recommend reading Eric Meyer's ""Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide."" Otherwise, this book is nearly flawless and will have you creating well-designed web pages in no time."
4,"Possibly Definitive, but not entirely Practical","Technically, this is probably the best book on HTML (and now XHTML) around. However, it falls short in explaining related topics adequately. For example, the chapter on multimedia devotes several pages to GIF, but doesn't bother to inform you that you must pay a royalty to Unisys when you use GIF, or even mention the new PNG graphics format that is replacing GIF partly for this reason but mostly because it's just better than GIF. The chapter on tips and tricks doesn't include the most important tip: run your HTML through a verifier to ensure that it's well-formed. If you're looking for a book that tells you how to create web pages, perhaps a less definitive but more balanced book would be best."
2,Not the best book for a Novice HTML Author.,"I bought this book as a text book for a class on Web Page Design. I found this book to be somewhat confusing, and the examples unclear. The book does contain all of the important HTML Topics: CSS, Forms, Frames, along with the basic HTML codes; and explains them in detail. It is also well organized. But, as a novice, I would have liked to have seen the book cater more towards the inexperienced HTML Author. I think it would have been better to give the reader a more ""user friendly"" text."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"With tons of books covering HTML it is difficult to find the right one. Because I was building a web site for the company I work at I wanted to ensure I had all the angles covered, so I bought several web publishing books. One was HTML: The definitive guide. As a programmer who was really familiar with the O'Reilley UNIX books, I figured this book would be just as good. Unfortunately the Nutshell approach just doesn't work for Web technologies like it does for UNIX books. The droning dictionary style and subdued tone put me to sleep. The book is also overpriced compared to other books of similar length"
4,"excellent reference, but just a good tutorial","I read the book from cover to cover with the intention of learning HTML this way, but what I found was that the reference qualities of the book made doing it this way painful. Because it is a reference, I found myself slogging through a lot of repetitiveness in various tag explanations. I could cite from memory now the section on every tag explaing the lang and dir attributes. This is critical for a reference that needs to be thorough and consistent and not assume that you've read through the entire book as I have, but makes using it as a tutorial inefficient. I read Elizabeth Castro's HTML book afterwards and found it a much better tutorial (and still a fine reference although not as thorough). Bottom line: if you want a tutorial, get Castro's book - it's a bit simplistic at times, but you'll learn what you need to know a lot faster. If you need an excellent reference, then get this book as well."
4,A very good guide to HTML,"When I got this book I had built two websites with an editor, and couldn't tell a tag from a hole in the ground. I bought the book HTML: The definitive guide and within a week I was coding my pages cleanly by hand! Since that time (6 mos.)I have created two domains coded by hand, that look as good or better than many sites that I visit. This book is a good primer for novices, and a great reference for experts. (Especially those who code with an editor)"
3,nerf hoop/ loads of fun on your first try then CRACK?,i think it would be alot of fun but wont last long because its only made of plastic so make your first dunk a good one
4,The sheriff's viewpoint,"A somewhat philosophical novel giving the sheriff's viewpoint of Robin Hood. It gives a realistic picture of the era, when torture was routine and common people could be abused with little recourse (the Magna Carta dealt with nobels' rights).King John orders the sheriff to deal with Robin Hood, whom the sheriff had been ignoring as a petty nuisance. The sheriff has other problems closer to home than the king's highway, including his personal love life, wandering pigs, local thieves, and tax collections. The sheriff's encounter with Robin Hood causes him to get religion. There is no Maid Marian in this novel - in fact Robin Hood's band tends to be unattractive, grubby social outcasts.The novel digresses into detailed descriptions of torture. That type of sidelight gives the novel, at best, a PG-13 rating."
4,A nice change for Robin H,"It's been awhile since I finished this book. I honestly don't remember many details, but I do remember enjoying it. If your a fan of robin hood stories and want something different from the same old rehash, I would recommend this."
2,The beginning of the end...,"I know a lot of people like this album and what JS became from here on out, but for me this was the beginning of the end; their right turn in the direction of pop superstardom and corporate rock darlings. I bought this album when it first came out and even liked 'Miracles' at first. But after being a JA fan through the first half of the 70s, this was my jumping off point. At some point Paul Kantner jumped off too, but I'm not sure where that was."
1,Too bad the airplane crashed,"To think that the Jefferson AIRPLANE made such great, cutting edge albums in the 60's, such as ""Surrealistic Pillow"", ""After Bathing At Baxter's"", ""Crown Of Creation"" to name a few, and then they stooped to making vacuous, boring albums such as this one.(Needless to say, the Starship aint the only band guilty of this all too common problem). What a shame."
4,NOT QUITE A MIRACLE BUT NONETHELESS GREAT,"Red Octopus is an enjoyable listen. The best thing to ever happen to Jefferson Airplane/Jefferson Starship/Starship was the four-year span when Marty Balin took over the reins and started making hits that would lead to great album sales.Though it may be over a quarter of a century since its release, Red Octopus still sounds great. No traces of the tired, drugged-out, past-its-prime incarnation of Jefferson Airplane are present. It was time for a new sound and a new phase.Unfortunately, change would once again come about, for the combination of Balin's vocals and Craig Chaquico's guitar solos provided quite a few golden moments that would never be, nor could ever be, followed up by the 1980's lineup of Starship."
5,Made in USA,"Great product,sturdy,well designed and built.I purchased this ramp for a cousin who is disabled. I researched other products but this seemed to be what i was looking for.I'm working on permanently securing this ramp to a van ,passenger side door ( 2008 Chevy Uplander)for an easier entry/exit,however it is not too heavy for folding or storage.This ramp is extremely well built:extruded aluminum ramp sections,the welds,the hinges etc.I'm a retired engineer and i would reccomend this product to anybody.Did i mention that this product is proudly MADE IN USA?"
4,Excellent resource to coursework,"Language Awareness was a required text in one of my classes, Rhetoric: Theory and Practice. It was used as supplemental material to the course topic. I read selections and then responded to them in writing using concepts that I'd learned from the class. The actual selections and exercises provide an excellent spring board for thought.It was definitely a fun and useful addition to my learning process during the course."
4,"1995 Issued Release, CD, Track Listing","This is the track listing for the cd version released by Tribute Records/Diadem Music Group, 1995 Copyright! Cover Art is the one under customer images that has a white background with 'Choir Gold' near the bottom right corner!1. Follow Me2. More Than a Story3. Let Freedom Ring4. Come Let Us Adore5. Hope to the World6. Redeemed7. It's in Jesus8. The World Is Hungry9. A Shelter in the Time of Storm10. Jesus Is All the World to Me"
3,post-60's hippy jam stuff here. 3 and a half stars,"Craig Chaquico and his guitar work is worth the price of admission on this release. Still, only 3 songs get a 5 star rating,the rest are 3 stars."
3,Middle Of The Road,"My feeling on Jefferson Starship's Dragon Fly is that it is an OK recording. Not offensive but not groundbreaking. Ride The Tiger is the most familiar piece on this record and its probably the record's best track. The next track, Thats For Sure incorporates some slick jazz tones and a couple of noteworthy hooks. All Fly Away is another track with a fairly compelling melody.As for the rest of the songs, they certainly have their moments. A compelling piano passage towards the end of Hyperdrive does stand out in an otherwise long winded tune. Some nice Grace Slick vocals on several tracks. Marty Balin's performance on Caroline is good in spite of the song itself dragging a bit. And of course some good guitar solos and violin tones help more than hurt.A three star rating seems about right. Truthfully, I would seek out Spitfire before this collection."
3,"Good, maybe their best one","When I bought this cd I was not a big Q and not U fan...""No kill no beep beep"" thrilled me enough to try this album, but anyway I wasn't prepared to what it would happen when I put it on the stereo.What was that? a damn good song... Soft Pyramids, a great kick-off song (not like that A line in the sand crap), an enjoyable moment of great music, and pretty cool lyrics (I love the way they sing spelling the words and creating this almost bizarre rhythm)...the other song I really LOVE is Air Conditions... it sounds like a little post-rock anthem, with an evanescent (and beautiful) melody and a great sound... ""C'mon where are you..""Snow Patterns makes the triad, another great moment of this album, which I consider to be the best one in Q and not U's short (for now) discographybut also in this album there are some fillers which ruin the work, giving a lack of cohesion to the album itself...I don't like very much the faster songs..."
2,Textbook indie foolishness,"2 1/2Unimpressive set of spastic art-punk exudes a suggestive jagged edge when in reality shows little musical knowledge to back any of this posing up. Q are your typical self-conscious Indie-type band who frustratingly attack their instruments and compositions before even realizing a direction in which to seek, and the best I can say about Different Damages is that it might make you bob your head in certain spots with it's immature but enticing rhythmic convictions. As annoying as much of it can be, at least they attempt to bait listeners every which way in their limited eclecticism's, and for younger experimental hipsters some of it will definitely work."
4,here we go,"q and not u is a fresh sound in the music scene today. they have an energy and produce melodies that will stick in your head for days. skeptics will compare them to fugazi and i say yes, ian mackaye produced the record but this isn't a fugazi clone. some of the songs are angular enough to make LIARS fans happy and some are catchy enough to make Bright Eyes fans happy. they sound very dc and very dischord.After their AMAZING bassist left i thought they would be terrible and they actually improved all the loose ends in the previous record ""no kill beep beep"" . ""Soft Pyramids"" is focused using the previous records jagged dc hardcore guitars adding samples and keyboards into the sound. The whole thing feels dancy yet rock and roll at the same time.perfect to play on your rainy april days."
1,Seriously,"You know, the drumming on this record is amazing, and John is an amazing person, however the other two are incredibly pretentious little twits that are just too cool for school. Seriously if you arent in the top echelon of the 'indie' scene or have a certain look, they wont talk to you like a human being."
2,I'd skip this one.,"The first couple of chapters are a good, concise reference to the core language, but the library reference is too stark-- most methods seem to have only one or two lines for description. Since this library reference is the bulk of the book, I don't think it's a good buy.The library reference in the Thomas and Hunt book (Programming Ruby: A Pragmatic Programmer's Guide) is much nicer."
4,better than expected -- but only if an adult plays Olaf,My daughter and I just finished playing. She was the kids; I was Olaf. An Amazon review I just read said that it is nearly impossible for Olaf to win -- I got that sense too. Other reviewers didn't seem to think that was the case. I usually make adjustments to games that don't make sense -- which we'll probably do with this one. Reducing the number of spaces to the gravestone for the Guadian would help improve the odds for Olaf. It seems to me a lot of thought was put into the game. As long as an adult plays Olaf -- I think kids will have fun with it. One complaint -- the game board won't lie flat in the version that we have -- which appears different than the one featured here. Ours came in a package that looks like a book.
1,confusion,"I actually purchased this game several months ago to take along on a family vacation. Needless to say, no one has played it yet. The directions are, I guess...'hidden'..??? Go figure. Ive read them, my middle two kids have read them, (and have all the snicket books so they somewhat understand the dialogue that goes along with the whole snicket deal), but no one has the patience to actually figure out how the HECK to play the game!I'll admit I became annoyed and gave up reading them. First you do one thing, then apparently that is scrapped later in the rules..and so on and so on until you are so confused, you cant possibly understand how to play.I should have returned the game to amazon. Toys R Us will not take back opened board games that they cant re-sell."
1,U SUCK,Dont buy nothing from this vender its been a month and some days and I still havent recieved anything!!!!!!!!!!
3,Travel Lid did not last,"I purchased this product at a ""Big Box"" store, and loved it. It was perfect to blend-n-go! That is until the lid cracked :(. Now I need to find me another personal blender. I see by other reviews the travel lid does not withstand the test of time. I have had mine for less than two months."
3,OK blender,"This blender is handy for on the go drinks but not very good at blending frozen fruit. I haven't tried ice for that reason. If large pieces of fruit are put in first before more liquid items, frequent hand mixing is needed. A bit of a learning curve is needed as to what works best whereas a larger, more powerful blender would not be a problem."
5,Need to Defend This Item,"I had some hesitation in buying this based on other reviews, but now that I've been using it I felt the need to defend this great little blender. As long as you put the liquids or softer items in first with ice cubes on the top this blender really breaks up the ice and blends beautifully. This had been a complaint by several folks and to me it seems to be user error more than the blender. Great little product for blending smoothies."
5,Blender,"This personal blender is very handy, not only it's a blender, but you can put the lid and take it in your car like a thermos. It's small enough where it does not take a lot of room, and it's a nice piece of machine. It blends ice real well."
1,Broke after 2 months of use,"The blender itself works pretty well with juice and powder supplements. The lid is a problem as no matter how hard I hold the opening closed liquid always seeps out. I was very disappointed this morning when the motor just died, it has only been 2 month ( I bought in in Mid October ). I will be upgrading to a more durable version without the lid problem. It was worth a try but in the end the quality is too poor for me."
3,Like everything but the smell and the lids,"Very easy way to make personal smoothies; however, if it has to work a little hard to crush up some frozen fruit, it begins to get that burning smell. Also, after a year or so of use, the lids are cracked and becoming unusable. Would be great if HB offered replacement lids."
4,Great Product,"Blender suits all of my needs. It crushes ice and all fruits I have put into it. It has a wonderful capacity, holding a large amount. Nice little blender, I would recommend it to anyone who needs a blender but not a full sized one."
3,Pretty good some of the time,"I was looking for a very small blender to make smoothies in my very small kitchen. This seemed like a good size and it does work pretty well. I make smoothies from just yogurt and cut-up fruit and 2 small ice cubes. This blender has a tendency to get stuck on just spinning around and not chopping very well unless I shake it to get the fruit and ice to the bottom. Also, I must hold it in place or it will spin right off the base. In other words, it doesn't lock in place. For my purposes it works fine but I wouldn't recommend it for heavier jobs."
1,Horrible!,"Thought this would be good for making my protein shakes. However, I soon found out that this thing cant even blend ice. You get what you pay for. I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about -- this thing is a piece of garbage."
3,I waited forever,"I waited forever for this blender and when it finally arrived, it was dingy looking. I already sanitize new items, but this thing had to be scrubbed and scolded. I didn't think I should have had to do all of that thorough cleaning, but it works well, nice and cute, and I'm enjoying the smoothies I'm creating."
3,Adequate,"I bought two of these. I like how the blender can be also used directly as a cup and its lightweight and easy to use. The motor is really weak, and if you hold the smoothie button for more than 15 or so seconds it starts to smell like the metal itself is burning. Cheap motor. I only use it for my protein powder + milk + an occasional banana. Won't even try adding ice."
4,"I'll give it a ""B""","This was a good item for the price . I wish the blender held more liquid , not nearly enough . Also , the #1 drawback - when you turn it on , the liquid is forced out of the little sipping spout that opens and closes on top of the lid . Even if you hold it closed with your finger , the liquid pools out . It's a pain ."
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.,Got this blender as a gift 3 years ago - have basically used it off and on almost every day for the last 2 years. I use it to make protein shakes and sometimes use as much as 3 times a day. Still running strong after so much use!
4,Works Great for its Price,"This blender has been great for me. I've had it for a few weeks now, and I usually have 2 smoothies per day. It's very convenient to be able to drink out of the blender container, but I wish it would hold more. The power of the blender isn't horrible strong, but it gets the job done. The blender will crush up solids like ice or frozen fruits, but I'd suggest going easy on the ice. It seems to struggle a bit."
3,So-So,VERY small and the contents often get stuck under the blade and have to be fished out before restarting the blender.
4,Great for smoothies but needs some liquid to work well.,"It's a very convenient product because it serves as a blender and as a drinking glass. Works very well as long as you add a good amount of liquid to the mixture, otherwise doesn't really blend. so it's excellent for smoothies for one."
5,Personal Blender,After my Magic Bullet broke I purchased this blender. I love it. Easy to clean and works well.
2,Two of them broke in a year's time,I ordered two of these at the same time and were used around 4-7 times a week. Both of the carafes broke after one year. I did put them in the dishwasher but our dishwasher does not have a heating element and uses steam to dry the dishes and most times I did put the carafes on the top rack. It is a shame they broke as they worked great. I used them to make smoothies for my two boys.
3,The 180 Degree Smoothie,The moment I got this in the mail I went straight to the kitchen and made pineapple banana smoothies for the family. With the weather being so hot where I am this product was a money saver and a joyful drink.
2,You'd be better off spending a little more money,"I had this blender a couple months, and I ended up replacing it. I bought it because it was cheap, but it's just too weak. It would stall a lot when I used it, and I would only have to use it for about 30 seconds before it started to smell like something was burning."
4,Single Serve Blender,Blender works well. Easily chops ice cubes. The only small negative is there is a slight burning smell at times.
5,So easy to use,"This morning I used my little blender for the first time and I LOVE IT. It's so easy to use, easy to clean and it's the perfect size. I don't use ice for my smoothies. I used older strawberries (cut up in small pieces) with plain almond milk, protein powder, honey, powdered fiber and ""ta dah"" - a great smoothie. For thicker smoothies, I plan to use frozen berries which should be easier on the motor/blade. I plan to buy one for a friend as a gift."
5,Perfect for senior citizen,My 92-year-old mother loves making smoothies with this blender! Not too difficult for her to operate.
3,Works ok as long as you don't put to much in it,"The little blender works ok, if you don't put to much in at once. I used it to make ice coffee and as long as the ice was in small pieces and went in first. I would only have to stop and stir it once. If you run it to long it starts getting a little bit of a burning smell. I would recomend this more for cooked foods, like to make baby food or salsa."
5,"Goodbye ""Magic Bullet""","I bought this blender after seeing that it has almost a 5 star rating. It is the best $17, I ever spent on a small kitchen appliance. I use mine 3 times a day to make protein shakes, with powder, water and ice cubes. It can handle the ice no problem. I will say, that you cannot hold the button down the entire time you are blending. It has a pulse button and should be used accordingly. I go for about 30 second intervals and then I stop to let it rest for about 5 seconds, and begin again. The longer you blend, the thicker and creamier your shakes/smoothies become. I have owned this blender for several months.I put mine in the dishwasher all the time and haven't had any problems other than a little foggy appearance in the cup, which is to expected.The only thing I would change is to have more cups with this blender, but then I found Hamilton Beach item#51102, which is the exact same item, with 2 cups for just a few dollars more."
2,disappointed,"I have owned 2 of these blenders so far. The first one lasted about 3 months and burnt out. I went back to using my old full-size blender which has lasted for years, but missed the convenience of the little single-serve, so I purchased a second one. The lid of the second one cracked after a little over a month. I went to the company website to find out about getting a replacement lid. The lid was not that expensive, but with shipping cost of almost $10.00 the part was going to cost almost as much as an entire new unit. I'm looking at purchasing a different brand now."
4,Smoothie maker,This is my second purchase of this item. I ownone so I bought the second one as a gift.It makes great smoothies!
1,"blender blade froze solid, can't use after maybe 30-50 uses","I bought this based on the previous good reviews. However, the blade shaft in the detachable jar froze solid for some reason, rendering the entire unit useless. The base unit continues to spin, but without the blade is useless. I'm contacting Hamilton Beach to see how their warranty section holds up. I did note in the warranty that they may not cover this situation, and that a replacement jar is $11.99. Probably, with shipping, that is the price I'd pay for the entire unit at Walmart. Not too happy of a camper right now, but we'll see if they send me a replacement for free. Of course, I doubt I have the receipt anywhere."
4,easy smoothie maker!,"Great little blender. I use it mostly for smoothies. Does great with yogurt, fresh fruit.etc. Very easy to use and clean. My only concern is you can only use ice that is chopped.Big cubes do not do so well. Otherwise for my use, totally worth $."
5,Great Product,"This little machine blend smoothy really well. I've been using it for 2 month every week.This blender is pretty strong for something under $20. I even blended frozen strawberries with it. Of course, it doesnt say in the manual that you can blend ice. What the heck... is only $20. When blending frozen strawberries, I do smell a little bit of smoke, but I don't see it. Since I am not using it the right way and it is withstanding abuse, I have to give it at least 4 star.Pro:Easy to clean. Water and dish detergent, blend blend blend. Repeat with clean water.InexpensiveCrush fronzen strawberries (Not listed in manual that you can do it)Cons:Smell smoke after 3-4 minutes of blending frozen strawberries (Not really a cons)The cover have a slot that allow a straw. When blending, smoothy can sometimes sipped out."
5,Great little blender,"I bought this blender about 6 months ago from Wal-Mart and use it daily to make my morning smoothie (and the occasional frozen margarita). I use fresh fruit, juice, yogurt, and full sized ice cubes. As long as you be sure to put the liquids in before the fruit and yogurt, it blends quickly and smoothly. The travel lid on mine works well and does not leak in the slightest. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a space saving, powerful blender."
3,"Great little blender, terrible lid!","Great blender, but cheap plastic lid cracked in 2 places within 2 months. And I don't think a replacement is available."
4,Just bought my 2nd one,"I was wandering around Walmart again thinking about replacing a stick blender I had worn out several months ago when I stumbled across this teeny, tiny blender thing. I have been using it at least once a day, everyday to mix powdered diets drinks with ice. I broke the cap trying to smash big ice cubes through the space on top but I continued to use it with the travel lid. Finally, one of the blades broke and I couldn't live without it, so i broke down and got another one. I discovered it was cheaper to purchase a new one rather than buy replacement parts. So, happily I am on my second Single-Serve Blender and I am considering buying yet another one to use in my office. Also, I remember seeing them in red around the holidays last year."
3,Convenient but not great,This single blender is good for making smoothies for one person. Having a blender that you can drink from and not use a glass is great. But my one complaint is it does not blend the frozen fruit very well. I have tried different techniques but it just won't cut up the frozen fruit.
1,Wouldn't buy again...,"Had the black model that I think came after this one. Liked it, but was replacing about every three months. Got this one and thought it was broken. You have to REALLLLY push in the pulse button REALLY hard. IF someone had arthritis in their hands, doubt they could use this. Granted, it doesn't take long to blend a smoothie, but it's like the button doesn't connect unless you push in as far as you possibly can. Love the idea of a mini blender, but after having problems with last two of Hamilton Beach's mini's, not too happy. Too much of a pain to return for this amount of money."
4,Fitness Fanatics Dream Blender,"If you're an athlete, you know how often you have to drink meal replacements or protein shakes throughout the day. Forget all the lumpy protein powders you've been drinking...here's the answer!! Everyone of the trainers and athletes I work with use this blender, because it is very compact. You can even portion out your powder in a Glad 1/2cup (4oz) Mini Round and stick it in the blender. Then all you need is either water, milk, juice and even a half a banana and this thing will give you a smooth drink FAST!"
5,Love this little guy,"I use this every day! I love making smoothies, and this makes it such a breeze. Great for other small jobs as well ...I regularly make a spicy Indian porridge involving a masala with tomatoes, jalapenos, fresh ginger (very fibrous) and coriander seeds, and it liquifies the whole lot with no problem."
1,blender is poor quality,"I previously owned this blender for at least 2 years and it was a dream. However they changed the LID on this blender and it leaks horribly. The part on the lid where you push it back to sip out of it or stick a straw, does not close tight and stuff leaks out of it. I have had it for one hour and it is going back. I will hunt for the older version. This new and improved with the lid is poorly designed."
5,outstanding,i was very well pleased with the outstanding help i received from you. have never failed to receive assistance when i needed it.thanks
3,Lasted 3 years,"I've used this blender for 3 years until a blade recently broke off when making a smoothee. It had a lot of use and worked decently for that time, it did seem to be loosing power as time went on. Large ice cubes will jam up in this thing requiring some shaking, stirring, and pulsing to get everything blended. I'm not sure I will buy another one at this time unless there are no better options for the price."
4,Cute little blender,"I bought this blender to make breakfast smoothies. I think it does a good job, but it is a little weak compared to my larger blender I used to have and I am a little concerned about how long it might last me. However, I like the small size and ease of cleaning and my smoothies have come out good."
1,Engine Burned Out Less Than 3 Months,"I used this smoothie maker for blueberry smoothies (protein powder, frozen blueberries, soy milk and yorgurt) - that's it, once a day. Engine is now dead, 3 major things wrong with this machine:1. You have to stand next to the smoothie maker and hold down the button for the smoothie maker to work (doen't work automatically)2. Doesn't funnel the ingredients downwards into the blades (so I had to often use a spoon)3. Cheap - less than 3 months and I have to buy another and do without my morning shake until I find a replacementSpend your money more wisely on sonething else."
2,Not Very Powerful,"If you plan to use this to make smoothies; I definitely DO NOT recommend this product if you will be using anything that is frozen. The motor isn't very powerful and mine quit after using it only 4 times. It just couldn't handle it. If you only want to blend soft items and liquids -- it would probably be adequate, but if you need it to do more -- this product may not be for you! I ended up finally purchasing an Oster Blender with a Blend-N-Go cup attachment and I am thrilled with it!!"
2,Had to replace already...,i would recommend spending the money for a better blender. I tried using mine to make a smoothie and the ice twisted the blades so much that I probably would have to work at even mixing baby food now! I went out and purchased a Oster blender that was only about 10 more then this one and it works much better. Hope this help!
2,Started leaking from the bottom right away,Just sent it back. The blade is not sealed well and your drink will leak out and make a nice mess.
2,Blender,"I am not really satisfied with this blender, if everything is soft and somewhat liquid, it is ok but do not try to make a smoothy!"
3,Linkin Yes pls Linkin...,"Fine the Concert was good,but the HD transfer is not that great.There is lot of grains seen in most of the songs.Yes but the audio quality is good.Ryan Vaz."
4,Great concert but bad video transfer,"It was a great concert with great audio. The video transfer was grainy though. If a LP fan, I'd definitely recommend it."
4,Linkin Park DVD,Purchased this for a Christmas present for someone else. Hasn't been opened yet. Arrived in a timely manner. Thank you.
2,this book is an awful review,"Being a cliffs study guide, I thought this book would be helpful, but it is NOT. I had to get another book that would actually help. The book just lists important names and places, and rarely explains them, resulting in you having to look up in the textbook all of the answers. It was worthless. The end multiple choice part was fine though."
4,Excellent When Used with other AP Reviews,"Although this book lacked depth of information when reviewing history, the tips on the multiple choice section and how to write the essays was fabulous. The practice tests were very helpful to me because I used this book to skim through the material, to look at the terms and to make sure I knew what those terms were (even though they were not defined). The tests will help you know how to deal with the real test. I used this review book with the one by REA and the Princeton Review, and found it very helpful."
3,eh,"This book has a lot of information, but many of the recipes call for ingredients that the average cook most likely would not have on hand. I was hoping for more basic recipes."
1,Do not bother.,I did not find any good information in this book. It contradicts a lot of the other diabetic books I have read.
1,boring single white female,"A boring 1968 french movie, when roger corman and mario bava were making much more interesting stuff, though they weren't french and had their movies released to drive-ins. Chabrol is more respectable, and less interesting.If you've seen SINGLE WHITE FEMALE that came about 25 years later, then you know what this movie is kinda about. Stéphane Audran is a rich, jaded, woman, who picks up a homeless girl, takes her to her villa, where two annoying men, akin to the comedy duo from BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA, are also living, for some boring times together that eventually ends in a death; big deal.The 2 most interesting things about this snooze fest is that, (1), Audran looks like a less charismatic Ingrid Pitt. And, 2, Audran was married to Jean-Louis Trintignant, who is in this movie, and later to director Chabrol."
4,"""compelling and thought provoking""","I found this book to be a remarkable story about a remarkable woman. It tells of a life of courage and her quest for knowledge. Ms Benford's research into the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin is well documented and her theories are most compelling. She brings you up to date on the latest scientific research. This book attempts to bridge the gap between the scientific and the paranormal, the natural and the supernatural, a challenge indeed.Ms Benford's research into the life of Jesus and the apostles is thought provoking as it challenges many accepted Christian Doctrines. I would recommend it to readers with an open mind in their spiritual quest or who like ""profiles in courage""."
5,Nice versital necklace,"Very pleased with this necklace. It lends itself well to many occasions. I have worn this with nice top for work or out around town on the weekends. Matches quite nicely with the earrings [Sterling Silver, Freshwater Cultured Pearl and Cubic Zirconia Earrings] and also matches the drop pendent necklace [Sterling Silver 7x9mm Pear-Shaped Freshwater Cultured Pearl w/ 6mm Round Brilliant-Cut Cubic Zirconia Pendant, 18""]. Be aware that the blue crystals are very light in color and that the necklace mixes blue and clear crystals together. All together this is a very pretty necklace and I am happy with my purchase."
5,Good Stuff without Fluff,"I am a FrontPage user and just bought the Dreamweaver4, Flash5 and Fireworks4 suite. I spent HOURS pouring over books on DW4 - I don't want a bunch of story-telling in an instructional book - I want the facts, up front, in an intelligent format and this book has it - the accompanying CD is a Realworks Video that covers the topics and is very good as well. My only beef is that the CD covers the beginner intro, you have to go to the website and buy the intermediate and advanced CD ($30 each) for this book and they should all be on the one CD in the book."
3,Three & 1/2 to three & 3/4 stars,"Kind of dark near the end, but a very nice book. The heroine, Devona, is a bit young (to me) -- 19 to his 30 -- but she has spirit. Rayne is tortured and wonderful, a gem of a hero.Some details are left out, like why Rayne became (and continues to be) a surgeon, but it's an engrossing story with lots of passion. It got off to a quick start and pretty much kept that pace. The other doctor, though, was an unneccessary distraction."
4,Excellent teaching Video,Each trick is broken down into many small steps. One must aready have the skateboarding basics (good board control & balance) for this video to help. But it definitely breaks the moves down nicely.
5,Great for family,"I searched toothbrush sanitizer for a long time and at last I found this.I used a few month ""Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer(49$) on amazon"" However, It was for only 2 person. After using this, and checked the inside. I surprised there was white water mold because it cleans by steam. You have to clean out inside every a few weeks. I didn't like it.Now, After using this product, I don't need to clean. So easy and convinent. If you have many family members, you can use this(over 5).If you put toothbrush on it, it lights on for few minutes and off, andregularly the light on and off automatically.Simple design and good product."
3,Sanitizer for Family,I bought it and want to put in the Master Room then It cames to realize that its too big for one area of the wall and never use it
3,"Still Good, but....","I really enjoyed the first three books in the series, first of all. And I enjoyed the early part of the book, describing Marty and Clark's journey by train to visit Missy and Willie, very much as well. However, Ms. Oke seemed to be relying less on the experiences of real settlers and more on melodrama as the book went on. It felt a little jarring. Also, Ms. Oke repeatedly interrupted the book with what read like selections from modern Christian tracts. I do understand that this is a Christian novel, however I prefer characters in the 19th century to express Christianity in a way that's consistent with the 19th century, not the latter part of the 20th century. For me at least, those parts of the book seemed anachronistic, and not well blended with the story. The book is still enjoyable, but it didn't seem as true to life as the first three."
5,Birthday Surprise,Anticipation to go West to see Missie and her family brought Marty much happiness and Clark was a hero who lost a leg but gained so much more. His determination to walk again with an artifical leg and much pray saw the family through some hard times.
5,First Rate Story Teller,"I was first introduced to Jeanette Okes' stories on Moody Bibles 'Stories From the Bookshelf' series, a radio dramatization. Having listened to the episodes and gotten caught up in the stories, I was excited when I learned that they had made the movies. I felt both of the first two stayed fairly true to the stories, but for some reason its' hard to fathom, 'Loves' Abiding Joy' is a departure, an entertaining story, but not the one the book tells by that title. It leaves it open for them to still tell this story but..what would they call that movie?""Marty and Clarke Go west?""Neverthe less It is all well written and the movies are well done. The other stories on the Moody Radio series are great as well.Gary in Savannah"
5,Love's Abiding Joy,"Janette Oke has done a wonderful job of traveling through the years. This is the 4th instalment of the ""Love Comes Softly"" saga. I find her work easy to get into and hard to put down. Keep up the great work Janette."
4,Drama in the west,"Another great story in the Love Comes Softly series. While I've seen most of the movies too, the further into the series you get, the further the movies deviate from the books, just so the reader/viewer is aware.In this book, Missie and Willie have moved west and Clark purchases train tickets for he and Marty to travel west to see Missie. The ride is long, of course, but they make it and meet their grandchildren. They plan on staying about 2 months but through a series of events stay longer and spend the winter out west as well. Great story with new interesting characters."
5,Love's Abiding Joy #4,"Great book by Janette Oke I bought this for my daughter so she can add it to her colection of Janette Oke books, shes a teacher and reads them to her class."
3,Good thriller,"This movie was a good rental if you like the new house, spooky neighborhood thrillers. It was worth the rental price on a lazy day."
1,Disturbing,"This may be the most disturbing film of all time. Disturbing because film making has come to this. Possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Anyone involved with this movie should be banned permantely from being in front of, behind of, or around a camera. They shouldn""t even be allowed to sell cameras. This movie could be used instead of waterboarding."
1,may very well be the worst movie ever made!!!,filmed on a $3 dollar budget and they got change back from that. Cant desribe how terrible a movie this is. The only reason there is to buy this is to burn it and get rid of the evidence that it ever existed. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!
4,The Belly of The Beast,"In a nutshell, this is Lou Reed at his brutal best: a live, almost heavy metal album, without all the studio tricks that we have today. With the remastering, the sound is clean and crisp, and the band plays very well. A good primer for all those 20 somethings out there who think Ashlee Simpson makes good music. This is about as real as it gets....."
5,This is Rock 'n Roll!,"Yeah, I know it's Alice Cooper's live band - who do you think Alice learned it from? The intro to ""Sweet Jane"" is every garage band's dream. I have this on vinyl - I'm digitizing it as I type this - and this is the sound of the dark side of getting high and walking on the wild side - and it's live! One of the best live albums, from a musician who put his soul into it. You want formula? You won't get it here."
3,Mumblin on the corner.........,"I have owned this album on vinyl for [gulp!]over 25 years. There have been several times when I have sold dozens of old albums to finance new purchases....but this album has always survived the dumper! Why? Simply because the amazing long opening introduction to ""Sweet Jane"" is such a great piece of fantasy guitar music that I cant bear to part with it! The moment when Lou actually begins to sing is surely one of rock musics major anti-climaxes after such a dazzling build up.....he must have been literally cowering in the wings at the prospect of having to follow such a brilliant prelude! The rest of the album is ok - but after playing ""Intro/Sweet Jane"" I usually switch to the recently remastered version of the Velvets ""Loaded"" [check the superb originals of ""Sweet Jane""/""Rock n'Roll""]...then dig out The Stooges ""Fun House"" which is THE album to play if you want a real walk on the wild side!Was this review helpful to you?"
2,Hunter/Wagner play the hits of Lou Reed,"If you're a big fan of old Bob Ezrin-produced Alice Cooper albums and love that oh-so-'70s guitar tandem Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, you'll love this collection of cover songs by some guy named Lou Reed.And if you happen to know anything about this guy Reed, you'll also know that if you want to hear these songs the way they were intended, you should pick up ""The Velvet Underground and Nico,"" ""White Light/White Heat,"" or ""Loaded.""Finally, to paraphrase the late great Sterling Morrison, talking about ""Rock and Roll Animal"": Why do the guitar players use the exact same tone on every song?"
3,Just the same as the original version,"If you have the old version already there is no need to get this one, really.This album sounds the same as the old version. There is no better sound quality that i'm aware of.I would go with take no prisoners over this. there are two songs not on there before. big deal"
2,Like Sterile Cover Versions Of His Best Songs,"Rock N' Roll Animal contains live versions of some of Lou's greatest works, mostly from The Velvet Underground era; should be great huh ?No, it's not. He's backed by the same session robots who played with Alice Cooper when he dumped his brilliant band after Muscle Of Love. This was actually the first thing I ever owned by Lou Reed, after I actually bought a Velvet Underground album I realized what...Rock N' Roll Animal actually is.Overall, competent and dull, no edge from the guy who created edgey rock.For people stuck on stadium rock ONLY."
5,lou reed sucks!,"but this album rules! i remember hearing this for the first time in 1978, i thought hey this is the same guy who sings ""walk on the wild side"" but this was real rock music with a great band. so i gave lou reed another chance and asked around, mostly what i got was ""hey man the velvet underground is where it's at"" from a bunch of psuedo intellectual, condesening, pontificating losers who didn't give a rats ass about rock n roll. so after wasting my time checking out some of the other dung that he put out i came back to this album. ""sweet jane"", ""white light/white heat"",""heroin"",""rock n roll"" are all intense jamming songs that i'll always listen to and enjoy!i would give this one six stars if they got a better singer....."
3,Mumblin on the corner.........,"I have owned this album on vinyl for [gulp!]over 25 years.

4,Don't forget the rest of this show !!!!,"This is a good show of Lou Reed and his great band. But don't forget to buy ""Lou Reed Live"" that is the rest of the show. I didn't forget for 30 years when Lou Reed sings ""ahh visciouss!!!"" in the song ""Viscious""."
5,Saweeet Jane,"You have to ask yourself this question.if I do not have access to this work,than is my collection ""solid""?This performance is a foundationof things to come."
5,Pure salvation,"This album is so good it's not hard to see why even someone as egotistical as Lou used to be, after years of dismissing it finally conceded that it is pretty good after allJust turn the music up loud and let it take you away and don't be alarmed if you get a drug-free high.(If you're not familiar with the Velvet Underground try ""Sister Ray"" from the White Light/White Heat album, a masterpiece from an earlier era of Lou)."
5,A classic,"IMO, this is one the best live albums. The extra tracks on this edition aren't good, but that does not matter as the originals are amazing.Especially, Steve Hunters guitar is superb."
2,"Good Music, Disappointing Mastering","This is a classic album, and the music is what everyone else has said it is. My gripe is with the remastering. I have the original LP of this, and I bought this CD mostly so I wouldn't wear out ""Sweet Jane"". Unfortunately, when they remastered this album, they changed the tonal balance, in a not so subtle way. They took all of the heft and body out of it, to the point where the guitars were almost tinny sounding. I was shocked, so much so, that I pulled the LP out and played it to see if my memory was faulty. It wasn't. I am deeply disappointed with this disc."
5,Plesasurable reading,"Rare and Commonplace Flowers innovates in the scholarly field. A carefully documented biography, it reconstructs step by step the story of Elizabeth Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares.Carmen Oliveira's literary achievement lies in conveying this research of undeniable academid value in a very agreeable piece of storytelling.A must for Women's Studies, the book is recommended to anyone who enjoys a good read."
4,"Vanity Fair July 2007 Africa Issue, Bono",Product was received in very good condition. Thank you for mailing the product in a timely manner! Product is exactly what I expected.
1,Did not work,"Hooked up a master and two remotes per the wiring diagram. It did not work. Double and triple checked connections and voltages to no avail. LEDs lit up for the remotes, but the master was blinking. Instructions said an intermittent or non-working LED was an indication of too low of a load (at least 100W), but the load was a chandelier with 20 25W light bulbs. Replaced the master, but the new master acted the same. Contacted the manufacturer, sending them several e-mails but they did not respond to any. Don't waste your time or money on this product."
3,"good feel, but sleeves long and roomy","PROS:Print is solid. Sewing good. Feels great.CONS: I have big arms and they still swim in the sleeves. I imagine it was designed for a specific type of knuckle-dragger, if you have unusually long arms,this is the one you seek."
5,Medicine for the Outdoors,"This is very useful for both novice and great review for professionals in medicine.Good for outdoors but also at home when medical problems arise. Snakes bites, stomach ailments and much more. Descriptive in plain english and illustrated very well."
2,Cute but too small should be called saucer not plate,I purchased this plate and the original you are special today plate. This one is entirely too small and should be called saucer. I love the other larger plate and have purchased two more for my adult children.
4,Can I say LOVE IT!!!,I am so pleased with these speakers. The sound quality is amazing. Especially for a simple girl like myself. They hooked up easily. My only complaint is that the remote is corded to the speakers which means you can't use it from anywhere in the room. But other than that I definitely love them and would purchase again.
4,It's fine,"It's definitely not the hottest sound quality out there, but that's not why I decided on this one. It's pretty much everything that I expected for the price."
5,great value,"We couldn't be happier with this speaker system. Unbelievably great sound for the money. I'm an aging audiophile and my demands aren't what they once were, but this should keep most of you happy."
4,Good for movies and games,"The Logitech's pack a mighty punch but leave something to be desired in the elegance of the sound. They're loud and they rumble...I love that, but I often have trouble tweaking the sound just right when I'm listening to music. Great bang for the buck, loud enough to piss off your neighbors and more than enough to drown out unwanted background noise."
5,perfect!,"this is a HUGE upgrade from stock computer speakers, the bass is great and is perfect for someone like me with a home office."
5,Logitech 2.1 PC speakers Z-4i,"I bought two Logitech 2.1 speaker sets: Z-4i and X-230. Overall the sound quality of both is very good and Z-4i is better (of course). What I want to share here:* The bass sounds ""tight and strong"" which is good for music listening, feeling like metal weights (not bags of water) are dropped.* X-230's bass appears to be slow meaning it is delayed a little bit in reference to the rhythm of the music. The Z-4i does not show this trait. However it needs a few hours to break-in, fresh out-of-the box its sound is quite irritating."
5,Great Speaker,"It is a great speaker with very nice looking. It comes with white. It looks luxury, clean and stylist. The sound is fantastic. And it worth what I spent for. The shipping is ok."
5,Crisp and Clear With the Right Amount of Bass,"I got these speakers for my new laptop because lets face it, laptop speakers dont cut it. I was very impressed with how good they sounded, and the adjustable bass is great when you want more or less bass depending on what your listening to. They go considerably loud without static, matter of fact i can put it full blast with very little static and it still sounds good. The speakers are small and futuristic looking, making for a good decoration as well. Would definitely recommend."
4,Amzing speakers,Amazing sound quality clarity and level .... and goes really well with my white mac book ....
5,Great for the money!,"You can't expect these speakers to sound like Bose speakers, but for the price they're darn good!!!! I bought them for my new Imac and I'm delighted with them."
2,Not worth it at all.,"I'm serious. I'm not being a jerk or anything.Logitech's a great company. However, I think they really screwed up on the Z4I's. If you have them set up with acoustic perfection, isolation stands, and an external EQ control, you MIGHT be able to make them work.DON'T GO CHEAP IF YOU'RE GOING TO DISH OUT 100 BUCKS.For 50 more dollars, you can buy the z2300's. I've had both, and I immediately returned the Z4I's. the 2300's are worth it. TRUST ME."
4,"Great sound, great price, good bargin","I bought this speaker system for the office, so I was not looking for something to rattle the walls and wake up the kids. I wanted something with a good base sound for mellow background tunes, and this system really delivers. I read the reviews that talk about this system not having the best mid-range sound, and I would have to agree. Certain CD's seem to lack a little clarity, but for the most part the sound is terrific! Bottom line, I was not looking for a state of the art digital monster speaker system, but I did want something that out performed the ordinary. After the rest of the office goes home and I am burning the midnight oil, I have been know to open the system up a little to hear what it can do... You can hear the thump of the sub four offices down, and the satellite speakers can really blast you away. Anyway, great speakers for the price, and I am positive you will not be disappointed with you purchase."
5,Z-4I - Great All Around Speakers,"Pros - Great Style, Well Made, Good Sound. A really great wired Remote.Cons - A bit weak in mid-range sound.These are great speakers for general use. The wired remote is easily mounted next to your keyboard and has a wonderfully large Volume knob that works extremely well. It also has a bass adjust knob, a separate ON/OFF switch and convienent Headphone/Audio In ports. The speakers have stylish yet solid and stable brackets that can be removed for mounting them on a wall. The subwoofer is adequate and stylish (for a box) with no hard to reach controls on the backside. These are my favorite computer speakers to date.If you want great 2-channel speakers, these are very good, but are just a bit short in sound. The style and the great Remote make up for it in everyday use, so unless you're an Audio Purist these should be fine."
4,Decent with a few weaknesses.,"I bought these speakers about 8 months ago, and overall they're pretty good! They were very easy to set up, and I have not had any issues so far. The woofer rattles a little bit at high volume, and cannot handle some of the high pitched bass, such as in Vans - by The Pack. The woofer sounds great if you stand to the side of it, but for some reason when you are in front, some of the bass is lost. The speakers are great for movies and games, and have high quality. The only thing i would improve on is more bass, and maybe more wattage"
4,More bang for the buck,"I was very pleased with my speaker system. I had been considering buying a sound system for my house, but the price of this system was too attractive. If you are slightly tech handicapped, as I am, you might want to have someone around when you hook it up-the settings are very important to the way the speakers sound in your particular situation. My husband is one of those (irritating) guys that likes to crank it up to impress company and this system will deliver. My only dislike is the white color-would have prefered black."
3,"Some good points, but it's better for design agencies","I manage a large corporate website, and was looking for good book which provides examples of common dilemmas faced in managing a corporate website...this book failed to answer them with any true substance. This book is geared more towards the design agencies only, not people who design and develop in-house. Also, I felt that it was very basic and covered many things I learned in my early days of web development."
2,"Might be OK for some beginners, but wordy, and lacks depth","I bought this book so it would provide me with domain-specific pieces of usability knowledge, but it failed at that. Althought there are concrete examples, there's nothing learn from them, as the explanations are so general they almost seem canned. It just takes basic usability concepts and applies them to popular domains, without going into any depth. And you don't need another book for that. The writing style often feels like a desperate attempt to beef up the volume. This isn't a useless book for an absolute beginner, but Steve Krug's ""Don't Make Think"" is several times thinner, and will teach you just as much, if not more."
4,"Great information, a bit dense","While I found the information in this book to be invaluable, I was expecting something along the lines of ""Don't make me think"" which I found enjoyable to read. If I weren't used to wading through programming books I might not have made it to the end."
4,"It should really be called ""patterns in website design""","I read 80% of this book first day. Then you have togo back couple of times. The book is organized in a interestingway, so it was kind of interactive experience :).Authors have lot of examples. Two of the authors are from academia with some industry experince. So you get best of both worlds.It's not entirely ""practical"" or ""theoretical"".You get a introduction to ""patterns 101"" using web design practices as example.Don't let the ""title"" of book fool, it covers very interesting/important topicthat most non-computer science/engineer get never exposed to."
1,Good idea but hopelessly out of date,"I think this book was probably very helpful a couple years ago. And there's still some good information here. But the web is changing so fast that a lot of their guidelines and ""patterns"" just don't apply (i.e. they encourage you to use popup windows).Wait until they revise the book before you spend the dough. Oh, and the website they refer you to for updates is an embarrasment!"
1,"Not worth a nickle, and worse","I bought this book thinking it would actually help me build a website. Their examples consist of amazon, yahoo, and a couple of other multi-million dollar sites and the advice they give is so simplistic it is obvious. Worst of all, the group that wrote the book sent me emails after i registered on their website and started calling me to buy software from their software company. do NOT buy this book.. there have to be better ones. . it's a big fat blue colorful book of fluff, designed to help them sell software apparently. i wish i could get my money back from amazon.com..."
5,Equally strong on usability and design,"Unlike many books on usability or on web or interactive design, ""The Design of Sites"" covers both aspects in equal depth. It is well research, with hundreds of examples, and it is written in concise language with oodles of cross-references to other sections. The book is very attractively designed, and works well from start to finish or with random soundings. Above all, it is comprehensive in addressing all design problems, yet brief and to the point on the many ""patterns"" (which could just as well be called ""topics"") it covers.Perhaps not the first book a new web designer should read, but a good candidate for the second one -- it is certainly of great interest to anyone who has begun to grapple with the many design challenges of web development.Highly recommended."
4,Very handy reference book and checklist,"While there are many books on the market that discuss patterns related to programming, architectural elements, etc., this is the first book I've seen that focuses on web patterns at the user interface level. The book is essentially an indexed, cross-referenced, best practices guide to building web pages that attract and keep customers. Or at least keep you from pissing them off. The authors have collected and summarized a great deal of HCI research (all listed in the resources section of the appendix) on web usability, so none of this stuff is made up--it's all based on time-proven, tested, and verified data about how people actually use the Internet (e.g., see Amazon, Yahoo!, Google, et. al.). A few of the patterns are no longer considered best practices, due to evolving standards (e.g., CSS) and increasing browser standards support. This is a very handy reference book, especially for an in-depth UI checklist."
1,Wrong product,"I ordered two movies, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. In the box of Before Sunset it was another copy of Before Sunrise. I have written twice to the company, no rsponse so far."
2,Slow and boring,Since I bought it I felt I needed to watch it. It was way too slow and boring for me. It is basically two people who meet and spend the entire movie(s) talking. I didn't want to even watch the second one but I'm cheap! I even checked my email while watching it. I would not recommend this movie.
2,Disappointing,"Although ambitious in scope, this is carelessly (though sometimes cleverly) written. The author seems to have relied on his memory for various information, with the result that new, ""What the...?"" bits of disinformation are added to the unsurprising appearance of long-held popular falsehoods. Worth $1.25, but don't believe everything in here."
4,The Airplane at their peak,"One of the most anthemic of rock and roll bands, this album features two of the Airplane's best anthems ('We Should Be Together' and 'Volunteers of America') as well as several cuts of unmatched musical beauty and spiritual harmony. And a Russian Army song. Still has a place of honor on my turntable, after all these years."
4,I'm a volunteer,"I like this music becuase it's real. People say that Jefferson Airplane is a bunch of Commie idiots, but I find them pretty thoughtful. The thing is, life is good, war is bad, and you always wind up stationed in Germany for awhile. Yeah, I give out the gear, and I'm proud to do it for the right cause, but now I'm not so sure. Anyway, let's just get toasted and have a listen..."
2,Volunteers,A Great album but this cd is poorly recorded and lacks sound quality. I do know that since I do have the original vinyl recording and a later tape. I was horribly disappointed with this cd
4,"Dated, but still enjoyable","This is the Airplane's most dated album. Hippie sentiments and calls for revolution abound.Musically, the songs are not quite as good as previous efforts such as Surrealistic Pillow, but there are some good songs. The classic ""Wooden Ships"" is still a great listen, as are ""Turn My Life Down"" and ""Good Shepherd."""
5,The second best Star Trek book ever written,Herb Solow's 'Star Trek Sketchbook' is the second best Star Trek book ever written! The first being 'Inside Star Trek' by Robert H. Justman and Heb Solow.Great pictures and sketch's-the pictures of the model of the sets that Matt Jefferies created is worth the price of the book alone!All in all a very good book.
3,"Have Your Reading Glasses Handy, Pops!","Only three stars for the all too small reproductions of Matt Jefferies' one of a kind sketches--sometimes reproduced as tiny as 1.5 x 2 inches and ganged up as many as four or five to a page! Now think about this, fans: most TOS Star Trekkies today are baby-boomers in their 50s and 60s (myself included), and typically with a certain amount of... ""age-related farsightedness."" Now, granted, back in 1997 when this book was printed, boomers were a tad younger than they are today. Seriously though, the book should have had a few dozen more pages allowing for bigger sketches. Otherwise, the book is entertaining enough for any fan of TOS, albeit a little light on information--but after all, it is a ""sketchbook"" and the emphasis is on drawings and photos."
5,Good Item,This set of spark and coil wire is such a good product! Very Easy to install! I got the delivery on time and now my car really feel better!
5,An extremely useful resource,"Superbly illustrated with full color photographs throughout, the Complete Landscaping from This Old House Ventures is a property owner's guide to everything from beautifying one's garden to building paths, walls, water features, fences, and decks, adding outdoor lighting, and much more to make the grounds about one's home appealing and lavish. Meticulous step-by-step, illustrated instructions provide an extensively detailed and clear narration, especially suitable to aspiring amateur landscapers of all experience levels. An extremely useful resource, Complete Landscaping is an impressive and strongly recommended addition to personal, professional, and community library Gardening & Horticultural reference collections."
3,Good Coverage on the Basics,"This book is a worthwhile investment for homeowners/gardeners who want to tackle their own landscape with a decent education on what's involved. The book covers all the basics of starting with your landscape wish list...garden features, amending soil & some helpful plant recommendations. Although this book certainly couldn't be depended upon as an independent source for completing a home landscape from start to finish, it definitely touches on all the important phases, & helps the reader realize how much is involved. As a landscape designer, I recommend this book to those who have little or no background with gardening, plants & maintenance, yet have the aspiration to begin learning how to bring their property to a whole new level. The photos are good too & that can help spawn new ideas!"
3,Cover and Thomas ain't no Robert Gallager,"This book is a predictable dissapointment. It is just yet another of the best examples of how modern textbooks have diverged from traditional textbooks of the 1950 - 1970's. Although this book doesn't focus too heavily on the ""practical"" aspects as far as implementation of information theory, it is clear that todays books are not nearly as mathematically rigorous as the books of yesteryear. ..."
2,Bought by mistake,"I downloaded this book onto my Kindle by mistake. After reading the preview, I thought I'd give it a try anyway. I am sorry I did. Cliche humor about stock characters. It seems that little effort went into writing this book and the payoff is just as hollow."
2,Disappointed,"I just didn't find this book to be funny. I was expecting more. The stories in the book appeared to be fabricated, making the book unfunny and more of a desperate attempt at just promoting a book in order to make money."
1,Really wanted this one to be funny.... wasn't,"I read I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell.. could be the greatest book written. Heard The Game by Neil Strauss was awesome so i gave this a try. WOW. Not Good at all. Bummer too, I really wanted it to be good."
4,Funny book,"It was a good, quick read, but hardly a masterpiece. Got a few chuckles and whatnot, and it's a good book to read on the beach or bus or something where you only read for spurts."
2,Somewhat entertaining,"Got this on a recommendation after ""I hope they serve beer in hell"" does not even come close to making me laugh as hard..."
4,"Well-written, keenly-observed compilation from The Phat Phree","'Look at My Striped Shirt' is a well-written, keenly-observed compilation of 'best of' humor taken from the popular web site, The Phat Phree. That site's credo - 'Target. Observe. Ridicule.' - is on great display here. Writers like Mike Polk, Charlie DeMarco, Jesse Lamovsky, Justin Harvey, Chris Queen - these guys are brilliant satirists and writers. It's a quick read, but one you'll be eager to share with friends."
3,Has it's moments but is very uneven,"Humor in books can be so hit or miss. And so it is with ""Look at My Striped Shirt.""This series of essays skewering many of the most odious stereotypes we encounter (and some I never even knew existed) runs the gamut from laugh-out-loud funny to complete dud. Reading one page you will find others around you staring out you for laughing so loud and then you turn to the next and you hear the literary equivalent of crickets.Like more and more humor books, this one is based off of the writings of a website, in this case thephatphree.com. You may want to visit the site before buying this if you are unfamiliar with their work and see if you find it at all entertaining.Definitely worth a skim to see if you might enjoy it. Just don't expect the quality to remain high throughout. Recommended with reservations."
5,Hilarious!,This book is at times dark and warped but I loved it. Very funny stuff. You won't be disappointed if you're like me and enjoy making fun of everything and everyone (including yourself).
5,Great tool for learning lower case letters,My oldest son is learning his letters and only could recognize the upper case letters as that is all we were practicing with. I purchased these so that he can become more familiar with the lower case letters. He loves to match up the lower and upper case letters. Great addition to the leapster products.
5,great,"My son knew his capital letters but had a hard time with the lower case letters. He would get the b & d mixed up. We have both the word whammer & fridge phonics. after a week of playing, My 5 year old & 3 year old know know all the letters big & little."
2,Does not fit the new sun shape design!!!,I bought these letters to work in the new sun shape for the alphabet letters and these do not fit in it. Although the box says that it fits all fridge models.
5,I Love this LeapFrog Series!!!,"This is a great product. I stumbled across it and my 3 year old was so excited. We matched up ""Momma and Baby"" letters and by the end of our playing he knew all his lower case. He loved hunting the paper ""Map"" that comes in the box to find out which letter went with which. We have been using this with the ""Letter Factory"" and ""Word Factory"" DVDs and in only a couple weeks he now knows all the letter big and small, their sounds and some basic 3 letter words. I can not say enough about this series. I'm not the hugest fan of all the LeapFrog stuff - but this one they did right! Lots of learning and LOTS of fun!"
2,not quite ultimate,This book contains 100 pages if you count blank pages (really 50) of 12 different patterns repeated 4 times on low grade paper. As tiling patterns go these are somewhere well short of ultimate.
5,Cool fun!,"You may well wonder what the big attraction is for a coloring book with all these odd little images.Try it and you'll see. Once you experience the great relaxation to be found in one of these collections of odd images to color, you will wonder how you ever did without them before.Crazy cool book! Turn on some Grateful Dead music and color away!:)"
4,"Requires a little creativity, but a NICE book to own","My 9 year old got this for christmas. He carefully chooses which pictures to color in. He gets mad when his little sister colors a page. I think he likes it so much, he wants it to last and last. I have had the urge to color in a few pages myself, but I resist! I recommend it for creative children, or budding artists."
2,Healing through False Doctrine,"I am concerned about this book, which was just recommended from a Christian counselor for someone I know. This Theophostic approach is contrary to Scripture, as neither Jesus nor God literally make a ""personal appearance"" in our lives. God dwells in us through His word, but Jesus nor God appear to us and tell us anything apart from God's word. This approach to healing is based purely on emotions. In this approach, a person waits to ""feel"" something different rather than work through the problem(s) and feel better through a genuine resolution of the pain."
5,My son's favorite book,This is my son's favorite book. Me makes me read it to him several times a day.
5,Perfect for pre kindergarten child,"My son was given this book as a gift for his 4th birthday. At first I was not very impressed. This is a children's story book with no pictures. When I read the two page explanation for adults the lack of pictures made sense. When I explained to my son that he gets to use his imagination and draw the pictures, he immediately fell in love with the book. He had my wife and I read the story to him over and over. He drew the pictures for the book.Most importantly, HE STARTED READING. Within two weeks he was not only reading this book, he was reading other books and even things like cereal boxes.The Magical Flower Planet is amazing. I highly recommend it for all pre-k to kindergarten age children."
3,Stats,"I need this book for my stats class, my teacher was the co-auther of the book Fred Bown. We did not use the book a whole lot in class just to look at some charts and formulas but he always put the formulas up on the chalk board. The only other thing we used the book for was to do practice questions for practice before tests."
2,Disappointing for an O'Reilly Publication,"Focused too heavily on dynamically created XML being transformed to HTML.I am interested in the power of XSL for transforming business data between disparate systems. Simple code examples from the web site often didn't work. No complex examples in the book.I was very disappointed to find that the ""XSLT Quick Reference"" in Appendix C consists of syntax requirements straight from the W3C spec and single line references for where to look in the W3C spec for a ""Quick Reference"".Example:For <xsl:apply-imports>The ""Quick Reference"" provides the following ...<xsl:apply-imports>See XSLT specification section 5.6: ""Overriding Template Rules."""
2,Incomplete and poor reference,"This book is not what I hope for. Although it has been out for a couple of years the author has not even aknowledged some of the major typos in the book (see O'Reilly web site).Although nicely written in a style that can be fairly easily followed, it is missing a substantial amount of needed reference material. For example in the section on conditional statements it refers to boolean expressions. Nowhere does he provide a list of operators or build-in functions available. You either have to build your own incomplete list gleaned from his examples or go find a good reference book.O'Reilly authors generally do a better job."
3,Showing it's age,"This book is definitely showing it's age. It covers XSLT as it was in 2001. It's all about having a flexible front-end and serving XML out as HTML and WML, or using it for internationalization. It's coverage of code generation is very, very minimal. There is also very little in the way of advice about increasing processing efficiency. There are also small mistakes; for example the misstatements about CGI and Servlets, which is a common error in Java articles and books.That being said, the examples are well annotated and the XML is highlighted for readability. The code is loosely annotated, which is the O'Reilly style, but it still makes some of the larger code fragments had to follow.As long as you know that this book is a little dated you will find reasonable material in here about XML, XSLT and how to get it into Java. It could use a second edition with more topical material."
5,awesome,it was awesome and in great shape recieved quickly liked every thing no dislikes i will recommened you to people
4,"Original, remastered, good sound and selection","Original hit versions, remastered. From the 40s and 50s. The sound is generally excellent with a few ""lip pops"" (when you open your mouth)that probably no one but a fuddy duddy like me would worry with.The selection is very good, no duds. There are 7 No. 1 hits. All are top 4 hits except two: ""Temptation"" was a No. 15 hit and a fine song. ""Mi Casa, Su Casa"" was a No. 50 tune in 1957, but it is still a fine Como song. If it hadn't been for R&R;, Mi Casa would have been a bigger hit."
1,Building Intelligent .NET Applications,"Don't buy this book unless you have a server to play with and an intimate knowledge of Microsoft server-based technology. The author depends on you being able to fill in the rather extended blanks in her intriguing yet very sketchy instructions on how to set up her examples. I had to give the book up as wasted money. It was a shame, since it was obvious, to me at least, that the author knew what she was talking about. She just didn't talk nearly enough for an ordinary mortal to ""get it"". :-("
1,The worst book I've on net,"This book is really a shame. It is a spot to M$. M$ names are in bold, it only talks about how magnificent is M$.What about the contents ? bleah ! copy & paste !Do not buy this book. Use that money for a pizza."
2,"thin, overpriced cushion","for this price, I would expect a much thicker cushion with more than just a velcro closure. it also lacks ties to secure it to the chair. feels very cheap and I think it is way overpriced"
4,A wonderful CD that you will love!,"Laurence Juber's CD ""LJ"" is a very pleasing album of acoustic music that has his excellent guitar backed by a first-rate ensemble. This is fine music that you will enjoy with your first cup of coffee in the morning, or late at night when you are alone with your wife, having finally gotten all of your children to bed. This is a definite buy."
1,Leaks,First hose I bought started leaking in a week. The second one leaked the very FIRST time I tried it.Do not waste your money.
3,not as good as lake of dead languages,"I absolutely loved ""The lake of dead languages"" and I devoured this book eagerly but it just wasnt as well crafted or as believable. The author seems to strain to tie the plot together."
2,Not seduced,"This novel has a lot of possibilities-a heroine with lots of conflicts and a number of confusing romantic options, a setting and characters that could be colorful, an economic resurrection component, and a literary mystery. So why doesn't any of it work? ""The Seduction of Water"" is flat and lacking spark. The characters do unconvincing things, and there are far too many coincidences. There's a layer of gloss so thick that it sticks everything, motionless, to the page.So why bother to review Carol Goodman's second novel? Because of those possibilities. There are so many elements that are almost there, that almost add up to a charming, funny tale with enough depth to describe it as literary. I'm looking forward to Carol Goodman's breakthrough."
3,Slow but interesting,I picked this book up as is was marked as a Ballantine readers circle book (usually these books can be counted on to be very good). The story moved too slowly to make it a great book. I was disappointed as it was a very good premise.
4,richness,"I love how Carol Goodman really takes me to a place. I see the buildings, the gardens, the rooms so well. I feel the mood. Very rich."
2,A Made-For-TV Movie,"OK I read the entire book to see if Iris ever found her mother's third book, but midway through I became disappointed with the writing. The language was cliched and much of the plot was predictable--as soon as the dry summer and water system was discussed I knew there would be a fire at the hotel. And what was that to-do about the 7-year age difference?But most of all, I could never warm up to Iris. What she (and the author) seem to be lacking is a good sense of humor!"
2,Still looking for a thrill,"The review quote on the book's cover called this an atmospheric thriller. Hardly. The book certainly had atmosphere as most well written novels do, but it was more of a mystery novel than a thriller. Much of the novel's length was spent in character development. The last hundred pages or so presented the mystery. I don't like being mislead by review blurbs that don't present a true depiction of the novel. A thriller is a book that you can't put down. This novel was easy to put down and hard to pick up again."
2,slopped together rehash of her first book,"It seemed to me that Carol Goodman, heady from the success of her extremely gripping first book, decided to write another one with practically the same plot twists, protagonist and supporting characters. Maybe if she was doing a standard mystery series this would be okay with me but I expected better from her. The pacing is extremely slow, the characters' actions often don't make a lot of sense and the convenient coincidences pile on thick, making a lot of the novel's outcome easy to see from a mile away.With hope Ms. Goodman, who obviously can write very movingingly and convincingly (just see her first book), will take some time to make her next book much more original and less contrived than her second effort."
2,"Review of Kindle format, not Book Content","This is a comment specifically on the kindle edition of this book, not reflecting on the actual content of the book itself. For a paid kindle book (as opposed to the free offers which often have rougher format) this has very poor formatting. The text changes from light to dark throughout the book and the table of contents is poorly formatted. Also, if you make notes or highlights on the book and attempt to return to that spot from the note menu, it does not return you to the correct page. Overall, this is the most poorly formatted paid kindle book I have seen, and others should be aware before paying $10 for it."
4,MUCH DETAIL,THID BOOK IS ABOUT THE NEW YORK YANKEES 1978 SEASON. ROGER KAHN DOES A GOOD JOB OF DESCRIBING THE EVENTS WHICH LEAD UP TO THE ASTONISHING COMEBACK FROM NOWHERE TO WIN THE AMERICAN LEAGUE PENNANT IN A PLAYOFF GAME FROM THE BOSTON REDSOX. MUCH DETAIL AND TIME IS PUT TOGETHER IN THIS ENTERTAINING READ FROM THE MAN WHO GAVE US THE BOYS OF SUMMER. I ENJOYED THIS BOOK BUT FOUND IT OVER LONG AND BORING AT TIMES. OVERALL I DID LIKE IT AND RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL YANKEE FANS. BUT A BOOK OF PAIN FOR REDSOX FANS.
2,"Good idea, but not much on the 1978 Yankees","The Yankees are my all-time favorite team so when this book came out, I was excited to see some new take on that incredible comeback Yankee team of '78. Boy, was I disappointed. Not only does Kahn barely look at the 78 Yankees until well into the book, he spends most of the time promoting his connections to other famous people, bad-mouthing favorites like Billy Martin and Thurman Munson, and rattling on about rehashed stuff. Save your money!"
1,The Wrath of Kahn,"Appears to have been written merely to vent spleen and fulfill contractual obligations with the publisher. An entirely unnecessary chancre of a book, mean-spirited and low-intentioned. Sadly, Kahn succeeds only in bullying precious publishing resources away from more deserving younger writers."
3,Half and Half,"A little I like this, a little I don't, Kahn is at his best when he is writing precisely about the events of 1978, for he has a true insider's viewpoint of the principals involved. When he lets the story tell itself, this book is great. But the downside is that you have to wade through a great deal of Roger Kahn to get to the good parts, and as a character in his own books Kahn comes off as venal and mean-spirited; there is a self-serving and nasty edge to some of the things he writes that is totally unnecessary. And in those portions of the book where he chooses to retell Yankee history prior to the 1970s, he is just plain sloppy, getting many of his facts wrong and repeating old myths that don't deserve the space, something that also marred his last book, The Head Game. In short, at times the book really could have used a forceful editor to reel the author back in and remind him what he was supposed to be writing about."
2,Average (so disappointing),"When the focus is on baseball and not religion, ethnicity, the author himself, and/or other politically correct issues - this book is at best average. Considering the title - you might expect a detailed look at the 78 season. It's not. So be prepared to be disappointed."
2,Sloppy and Disappointing,"I wanted to like this book and expected to like this book, but there are just too many flaws. When the focus is on Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson and the turmoil of the 78 Yankees, it's insightful and interesting. But relatively little of the book actually is about the 1978 season. Far too much space is given to sloppy, meandering passages about baseball history and odd, mean-spirited, and entirely unnecessary swipes at other sportswriters. This seems to have slapped together with little thought, research, or editing."
3,How I want to massively bring the hate upon this album,"...but I can't. At least, not entirely. ""Faint,"" ""Breaking the Habit,"" and ""Numb"" in particular just sound too good.One-note lyrical concept? Check. With these guys, it's always That Darn Girl's fault that the singer is (or at least poses as) inclined toward various degrees of violence against someone or another. Usually himself. I don't believe it for a moment, but what the heck. As gimmicks go, I guess they could have done worse.Once you learn to go with the ridiculous lyrical flow, let's face it: the guitars sound really f*in good. Heaven knows enough money was thrown at them. Relax, disengage your mind as best you can, and let the angst wash over."
4,Good to the last drop,"If I were to rate this album based on how ""metal"" it is, then it may not deserve a good rating. But, that isn't fair. There are countless artists that are not metal, but are good. So, I'm not sure why reviewers are saying it's not good because it's not metal. This is a good album. My only complaint is that it's too short, but it is good to the last drop."
5,Perfect CD...,"Okay, I have to get some things clear. Number one, Linkin Park is not a metal band. They fuse hip hop and rock to make a different nu-metal sound. and they shouldn't be classified as nu-metal either, if you count songs such as ""Breaking the Habit"" or ""Cure for the Itch"". Number two, don't compare them with rock bands such as Metallica or AC/DC, because, once again, Linkin Park is not pure rock. Now, on with my review. I got this CD sometime in December 2004, and it has been my favorite album ever since. I liked the way they wrote the lyrics and the choruses in a few songs. From the hard rapping of ""Faint"" to the haunting themes of ""Breaking the Habit"", these songs all fit in to make one perfect package. Please give this CD a shot, because you never know when you can get hooked to a band."
5,whats with the hate?,"people dont like linkim park because they complain and whine on there songs and call them untalented cuz they are metal/rap and there not real rock music. i dont agree there a great band for any fans its just that people these days complain rock music has to be about anger and psychotic. well for all of you thinking like that, THis is real rock music!! yea Rock On DUDE!!"
5,"You so called ""metal heads"" need to have your heads examined","While I can understand someone not liking Meteora, which I happen to own and think is a great cd, I cannot for the life of me understand some of these ignorant ""music"" fans. That one idiot who is still bringing up the names of King Diamond, Testament, Cannibal Corpse?? Are you kidding me? You call Cannibal Corpse a good band? Maybe if you like killing kittens and puppies, have never had a girlfriend, think it's cool to dress in black from head to toe, and hate your parents it would be a good band. Maybe you should learn about music before you comment on it, ""THEMETALBEAST"". While no band today or tomorrow will likely compete with older Metallica, the fact that you trash Meteora but brag about King Diamond and Cannibal Corpse, along with the rest of those amazingly sad excuses for musicians just proves that you have no idea what music is MetalBeast!"
1,HORRIBLE,Here come the keyboards!!!!!!!Here comes the 35 yr old rapper!!!!!!!!Here comes the same power chords played over and over!!!!!Here comes a screetchy singer complain about his relationships!!!Here comes 12 yr olds to the music store to buy this CD!!!!!!Here comes another HORRIBLE album by linkin park.
4,Interesting,"although so many found hybrid theory to be the best cd that ever was recorded i thought, .... Yes, there were a few catchy songs such as crawling, and they did improve hybrid theory by making the remix cd. But up until Meteora i thought they were just another mainstream band that the previous ... had graduated to. Meteora is quite a step forward from Hybrid Theory. The beats are nasty and the lyrics no longer sound like that of a middle school talent show band. So, Linkin Park, you guys did a great job, seemingly going from a radio band to one that shows actual musical talent and uniqueness."
1,poor,Linkin Park is an over rated band. They did nothing to perfect their sound. They simply just took the beats from the last album and the cd is only 36 minutes long. All these songs sound similar its just said that Linkin park could not step up and change their sound a bit. In my own words they didn't grow at all
5,AWESOME! LINKIN PARK AT THEIR BEST,"Ths album defies even their hybrid theory in my opinion. They went to a more rap sound in their ""reanimation"" album, but now with ""meteora"" they have come back to their rock roots. This album is for sure to sell millions. Make sure you get this album and help Linkin Park out.PLEASE BUY THIS ALBUM sure to be a #1 in no time"
2,Don't waste ur money,"Okay, don't get me wrong, linkin park is my favorite group. But this CD is just bad, terrible even, it has a few good songs, but the majority is Annoying, either the beat is annoying, the beat and the words don't go together, or the words are annoying. I recommend borrowing the cd ..., and then either burning it, or writing down the few good songs to download it, but the...bucks that everybody's charging for the cd by itself and the...cd/dvd pack is about...overpriced. Sorry Fellow linkin park fans, but it's the truth. Hopefully a fourth CD will come out with more than just 3 or 4 good songs. Oh yeah, I forgot, the cd says it has 13 songs, but it really has 12. The first one is a 13 second intro of somebody breaking a glass."
5,Lincoln Park does it again,"I was wondering how Linkin Park would follow up their great debut cd, and it couldn't have been any better. This CD is at some points classic LP and at other times its breaking new ground for them and just showing how creative they are. Somewhere I Belong is a great song and another I love is Easier to Run, plus Breaking the Habit. Its a great cd overall and Linkin Park was able to create a cd that only further proves their talent and that their first cd was no fluke. For all LP fans out there, get this for sure, its a great follow up cd and all the songs are great."
4,this album is more good rap rock,"for those who need a little more excitement in your new cd collection, pick this one up. rock music is going kinda slow right now, but thankfully linkin park churned out some more catchy, rock out music."
5,Better than Hybrid Theory!!!,"Awesome album!!!No sophomore jinx for Linkin Park. This CD will be the CD of the year. Hands down it just kicks .... You have to pick this up, it will blow you away. It is a bit heavier than Hybrid, but that's not a bad thing."
5,REFRESHINGLY BRILLIANT.,"All tracks are great, but the best are Faint, Dont stay and Numb.BUY THIS CD."
4,it gets better,i heard alot of bad reviews about this cd but this is one of my favorite cds. i do not think of it as a carbon copy of hybrid theory. there are some of the same beats but the songs are different. in my opinion this cd is better than hybrid theory.
5,Oh Yeah!LP Rocks!Meteora rocks too!,"This is the best CD eva!Anyway, this is a must have for any LP fan.It has less rap, a tinny bit ""pop"", but a whole lotta rock.It not talkin about bad things, but the things people go through(STRESS!).My favorites are Hit The Floor, Faint, and Nobody's Listening!If your'e not sure about this CD go to launch.com(clean yahoo! music website).Listen for Don't Stay, Somwhere I belong, Lying From You, Hit The Floor, Breaking The Habit, Faint, Figure0.9, From The Inside, Nobody's Listening, and Numb, BR>I recommend it for any rock lova!"
5,AMAZING...IT TRULY CHANGED MY LIFE,"THERE IS NO WAY TO DESCRIBE THE WAY THIS ALBUM MADE ME FEEL. I MUST HAVE LISTENED TO IT EVERYDAY, FOR A MONTH, ON A 45 MINUTE BUS RIDE TO WORK. EVERY TRACK WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NUMBERS 1 AND 11 IS NOTHING SHORT OF PERFECTION. I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I HEARD ""NUMB"" I WAS SO ALTERED BY IT I FELL OUT OF BED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN MY COUSIN TURNED IT ON. THE FIRST C.D WAS GOOD, BUT I CAN TRULY SAY THAT AFTER HEARING METEORA, I COULD DIE RIGHT NOW AND STILL BE HAPPY. I'VE BEEN TO EVERY CONCERT EVER PLAYED IN THE L.A AREA AND SAN DIEGO AND THEY WERE ALL JUST AS MIND BLOWING. LINKIN PARK IS THE GREATEST BAND OF ALL TIME AND IF THEY EVER STOPED MAKING MUSIC OR PUTTING ON LIVE SHOWS, I DONT THINK MY LIFE COULD GO ON ;)"
5,Linkin Park.. ahh..,"Meteora is a very nice follow-up to LP's debut album, Hybrid Theory. Unlike HT, Meteora has that drop-d sound in almost every song, thus making this sophomore album heavier. The lyrics seem a little lazier done than on Hybrid Theory but I completely understand you can't make a perfect thing more than once. Not that the lyrics were bad I could really relate to Meteora's lyrics more than HT's. Chester and Mike collaborate with each other just as well as they have been, and the guitars and bass are earthshakingly heavy. The drumming seems to be a little more matured and complicated which makes this newer sound seem more grown-up. As well as Mr. Hahn, the most fabulous DJ, his scratching is more apparent in this CD too. If you liked HT but was turned the other direction by Reanimation, don't let that opinion make your choice for you. I am telling you:BUY METEORA. IT ROCKS."
1,one of the worst bands ever!,this is one of the worst bands ever. wannabee pop rock sellouts. their music is absolutely crap and people everywhere are tired of these sellouts on MTV! they are useless talent band up their with nsync and milli vanilli
1,Mind-numbingly boring and predictable,"There is absolutely no talent here. Unoriginal riffs, unoriginal songs, unoriginal lyrics. Don't help Linkin Park kill rock.Default, Hoobastank, Linkin Park = not rockVelvet Revolver, Monster Magnet, Stone Temple Pilots = rock"
4,I have to admit I'm still listening to this,"Ok, long story short, I used to be addicted to Linkin Park, Deftones, Trapt, Taproot, ect.Then, I found Post Hxc and Indie. I fell in love. All my old CDs are nowhere to be found.Trapt is replaced by Kaddisfly, KoRn is replaced by Norma Jean, ect.I still listen to Linkin Park. Even though Linkin Park isn't even 'Cool/Underground' to you all anymore, they have that 'esque' many other bands [ahem, Limp Bizkit] seem to lose once they make it in the music business.I can still say Linkin Park is original.Let's just hope they don't stop making music."
3,Tell me why Hybrid Theory is so good,pleas tell me why people say meteora sucks I have meteora and my friend has Hybrid Theory he let me listen to it they sound just alike
2,DISAPPOINTED,"Now the review this site provides you...don't listen to it. I'm a long time LP fan and they have it totally backwards. Hybrid Theory (HT) had great lyrics, great videos, and a lot of anger. Now with meteora its too pop. The numb and faint videos [are terrible] and all the lyrics on the album are shallow and far to easy to interprept on only the first listen. It's also a worse copy of HT. Along with being poppish they are now becoming sell outs (having own shoes) if you want the real and better LP get hybrid theory or wait for next CD, hopefully it'll be better. If the next Cd isnt good i have to give up becuase then they are hopless. so as a closing thought remember HT is anything but pop and meteora is all pop. so for you teenies out there. this is for you. but you rock fans who listen to lyrics. i wouldnt recommend this... :p"
2,Generic Hybrid,"A carbon-copy of their first album, and not even a good one. After the promising ""Reanimation"" (technically their best album, although they needed a dozen other artists) I really thought they would stretch out as musicians. How foolish! 2 stars for ""Somewhere I Belong"" and ""Faint""."
1,butt ugly,"How can people listen to this godawful crap? I thought rap metal was finally dead then these bastards show up and begin selling millions of albums to folks with more money than brains. If you want to listen to some white guy rapping buy an Eminem record. At least he's got some talent. If you'd like to hear kickass rock buy the album White Bood Cells or Elephant by the White Stripes. Or buy any rock album, chances are it will be better than this Lincoln Logs record. Or Linkin Park. Whatever the hell they're called. This band is the toilet of rock. Please don't buy their music."
1,really? i thought it was hybrid theory,"my title is not an exaggeration. i heard this song at my friend's house and i seriously thought it was hybrid theory. i have heard the whole hybrid theory album (it was a long painful process i would rather not discuss) and i told my friend that this song didnt sound familiar. then he told me, ""its their new one"" yes it makes sense. ... as for all you real music fans out there go buy a Godsmack's ""Faceless"", which is a GOOD release of 2003. ..."
3,too short,this CD is way too short....it can't come around Hybrid theory at all...only like 3 tracks thats stand out
5,Great Follow-Up Album,"For awhile wondering if Linkin Park would be able to release an album that would live up to their fame. Yet, confident something worth while was in the making, I am very pleased with Meteora. For anyone who has been a fan of their previous work of art, they'll love this one and find it hard to stop playing it. The lyrics, I believe are relatable to many people out there. Hey, it's becoming a sell out in many areas. WASTE OF MONEY IT IS NOT!!!!!! Wondering if you should buy the album with DVD? I liked, so have those I've shown it to. A half hour on the making of the album, I'm not the least displeased that I purchased it."
4,the best is still to come but close,"I have to say i was pretty impressed by meteora. Linkin Park may be commercial, but they stood on what they were doing. I must say that the instrumental disapointed me, and the rap too. But the might be part of the game, and i have nothing to say about the rest of the album. Well ... maybe one word ... awesome ... any real fan of LP would really like this album like i did ... but it is not mine to judge for you ..."
4,More of the same? Not really...,"People who enjoyed ""Hybrid Theory"" will not be disappointed by this album. LP also experiments a little more with the electronics in this one, and the provided booklet does explain the direction they wanted to go in well. For those who didn't like the album for various reasons perhaps were expecting too much -- after all, ""HT"" was an album strewn with anthems and such, and yes LP is a bit commercial, but expecting them to turn around and do a 180 after ""HT""'s success is a little naive. All in all, great music to speed to."
4,Great Second CD!!,"I loved Hybrid theory, and was much anticipating the release of Meteora. As mentioned before, everyone knows of the ""sophomore curse"", but in this case it was broken. Great CD!!"
3,Anyways..,"I realise that most of you have a negative view on this CD but on some points you have to admit, you are over judging. The CD maybe short, but come on now, back in the fifties and sixties songs were barely over two minutes long. Leave the long songs to bands like Metalica and Ozzy, but don't criticize the ones that don't pull off that almost-but-not-quite-annoyingly-long song thing.Meteora does get a little repetitive and grow old a tad too quick, but they also have their unique musical style from the first CD, Hybrid Theory. They mix rap, rock, classical, and a little bit of pop at the times. Instead of criticising them for their originality, applaud them for there non-comformity.Though not as good as Hybrid Theory, this CD is well worth a listen to."
5,Hot!,Yo this cd is a must get.This Cd is near perfect....but still no cd will ever top Hybrid Theory...
3,More of the same ...,"If you liked Hybrid Theory you will like this, it's more of the same, exact same sound as their debut, few experiments (drum and bass on one song). Big ph fat production (blows outta your speakers). Excellent formula songwriting but nothing TOO exciting."
2,Calling all TRUE L.P. fans...,"There isnt a whole lot a guy can say about this album, besides how much of a dissapointment it is. Almost every song on the album sounds like ""In the End"" and ""My December"", the 2 songs that i dont like on Hybrid Theory. It is too ""poppy"" and doesnt bring the same awesome riffs that hybrid did. Calling all TRUE L.P. fans...we need to voice out soon or a potentially great band will be lost. over and out."
5,Linkin park very good,"Except for the total track time (37 mins or so). This cd is amazing. As much as I love their beats and voices, the lyrics are what get me. This record just seems more polished and reflective. It seems they are at the point where they reflect on their experiences (more thoughtfulness than anger like Hybrid Theory), knowing that how it made them stronger and emotionally tougher, how they are not the only people that experienced that pain, and that they can exist without that pain, and that its over, that they are ""numb"" to it now.A definite buy, you wont regret it.-karthik"
5,Linkin Park is by far the greatest band in the universe,"Linkin Park is by far the greatest band in the universe because they rock... rock hard... yeah. they are sooo goood and this album is just proof of their invincible greatness. yes, invincible greatness. they can't be stopped. holla."
2,Dont bother Buying This,"I USED to be a very big fan of Linkin Park, but I have to say that LP has gone down the gutter...The only track I enjoyed was Hit the floor, but even that wasnt all goodMy advice to Linkin Park would be to stop trying to be like Korn and trying to rap...Hybrid Theory was much better then this"
2,THAT'S IT!!!,"36 minutes and 43 seconds, as soon as I pressed play it was over! I'm rather disappointed in LINKIN PARKS new cd. The sound is still there but nothing really new or exciting. REANIMATION was better than METEORA and that was just a remix. The most disappointing attribute to METEORA is the length, 36 min and 43 sec long. LINKIN PARK is a great new band, different, but almost 2 years after their debut all they could muster is 13 songs, one was a 10 second intro and another was an instrumental. I guess it shows hungry fans will buy anything, I did. I would think as big as HYBRID THEORY was they would put a little more effort into their second album. Guess I'll look forward to GODSMACK, hope they just don't throw a quick 13 songs at us."
1,I wanna be sedated,"Have this band sedated...please. This music is horribly sang and unimaginative. If you want a great rap-metal band listen to Rage Against the Machine...This music is filled with whiny vocals, STUNNINGLY trite and myopic lyrics, and unnecessary rapping that annoys the listener by mangling itself around the so called riffs. The guitar is boring and there is nothing here remotely inspiring."
1,POP SELLS!,"I've seen this band live and omg do they stink! The cd is a follow up to an ok cd! This cd is full of mixed rock/songs! This cd is not a metal cd! Get that in your head now! I've heard every song on here and its too whiny! This band isn't even original with their song writing! I find it sad that on their dvd they had writers helping them to write songs! Their are songs like Faint, Somewhere I belong, and much more stuff your going to have to listen to on the radio! Do not buy this cd! Tell bands like Linkin Park that we want rap/rock to go away!"
1,COPYRIGHT CANNOT RIP THE MUSIC,"THIS CD IS COPYRIGHTED AND WILL NOT PLAY IN MY COMPUTER AT ALL. DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE THIS PROBLEM? IF YOU PURCHASE THE CD ONE WOULD THINK YOU CAN DO WHAT EVER YOU WANT TO WITH THE MUSIC. WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF MP3 PLAYERS AND IF RECORD COMPANIES CONTINUE THIS PROTECTIVE PRACTICE, IT IS TIME WE BOYCOTT."
1,I Hate This!,Linkin Park suxs they can't there music gets old an annoying I hate this band now trying to get ride of anything with Linkin Park On it. This band should be called PUKE and not the good kind.
1,Waste of money,"Okay - where can I start? This CD is the biggest waste of money. I listened too it and was morally disgusted.Not only does the music sound terrible, the lyrics have no musical meaning.Avoid this album."
2,ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"Ok now don't get me wrong here i used to really like lp in hybrid theory days they were new there lyrics were amazing, The reanimation came out the only thing that kept them from fully selling out here was guest appearences by Jonathan davis (KoRn) and aaron lewis( staind) Meteora though is very stale and repetitive the guitars drums electronics and the mix of singing and rapping gets old fast and you can't even hear the bass. Its sad to see a good band go bad, now you might be thinking why didn't i just rate this 1 star? well because the 1st single ""somewhere i belong"" has meaning isn't stale and shows potential for this and same with breaking the habit but other then this the album sounds like they failed at making hybrid theory pt. 2"
5,LP. Greatest band ever. Period,"alright quick rundown of each song.1. Foreward: not much to say, good intro into2. Don't Stay: Very hard song. good message. 4/53. Somewhere I belong: good song. great message. little slower with some hard parts. 3/54. Lying From you: awesome intro. hard song. 4/55. Hit the floor: nother awesome intro. very hard. 3/56. Easier to Run: not my faveorite but still a good song. little slower. 3/57. Faint: not much to say except quite possibly greatest song ever done in history. 6.5/58. Figure.09: good follwing song to faint. little harder more rap. 4/59. Breaking the habit: another song quite possibly being the greatest in history. very good mix of all wut LP is. 6.5/510. From the Inside: good mix of hard and softer rock. 4/511. Nobody's listening: great example of LP's hip hop side. 5/512. Session: not a fan of the no lyrics but good for lp. 3/513. Numb: last song. possibly the best of all. 7/5"
1,HEAVY METAL FREAK,"THIS CD IS GARBAGE, WHEN I SAW THE REVIEWS SAYING THAT THIS CD IS HARDCORE METAL I DECIDED TO BUY IT, WHEN I HEARD IT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TU PUKE. IF YOU ARE A METAL FAN (REAL HEAVY METAL), DON'T BUY THIS CRAP, BUY CHILDREN OF BODOM,NIGHTWISH,INFLAMES,KALMAH,NORTHER ETC. THIS IS NOT METAL. THIS BAND SUCKS."
1,HA HA HA HA!!! No.....,"Does this craptacular band think they're metal? With lyrics like, ""Don't stay. Forget our memories. Forget our possibillities,"" and, ""I'm tired of being what you want me to be,"" are emo not metal. With an inaudible bass, annoying as hell lead vocalist, and a terrible guitarist this band are more Limp Bizkit wannabe than new metal gods. Here's more suggested listening:Metallica(old)SlayerIron MaidenPanteraAnthraxKing DiamondMegadethGWAROpethType O NegativeSepulturaChildren of BodomMy Dying BrideVenomOzzy Osbourne/Black SabbathDeicideIn conclusion, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park are two garbage bands that are destroying metal this generation. Let's stop this once and for all!!!"
1,This is what Forrest Gump would listen to.,"This music is for people with the mentality of Forrest Gump. Or how about Crazy Cooter from The Dukes of Hazzard? Perhaps Otis from The Andy Griffith Show. You get the picture, now don't get the cd."
2,Not as good as the debut,"After buying Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory album, I was expecting a lot more. On their website, the band billed this album as being ""darker"". I suppose that's one way of looking at it. I found the album to have a murky, boring sound, and I actually found myself enjoying the rap more than the rock, maybe because the ""rock"" part is very slow and balladial. It was completely devoid of the screaming that made the first album so enjoyable, and almost devoid of the rap that made the first album so fun to sing along to. What was I left with? This murky-sounding, second-rate alternative metal. But still, I have to give Linkin Park credit for being a metal band that is anti-violence and anti-hate, and curses even less than Good Charlotte."
1,ONE LONG SONG...............,"THEY SUCK!!! IT'S LIKE LISTENING TO A 37 MINUTE SONG. EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME. THIS ALBUM IS THE EXACT SAME AS HYBRID THEORY, THEY JUST RENAMMED IT. THESE KIND OF BANDS MAKE ME SICK. I HATE THESE LITTLE TEENIE POP/ROCK/RAP/METAL BANDS. THEY PLAY THE SAME LITTLE POWER CHORDS OVER AND OVER.... I DIDN'T BUY THE CD, SOMEONE MADE ME A COPY AND I CAN'T EVEN LISTEN TO THE WHOLE CD. I SAW THEM ON THE SANITARIUM TOUR, AND THAT MADE ME HATE THEM EVEN MORE!! THEY HAD NO BUSINESS BEING ON THE SAME BILL AS METALLICA..( THE GREATEST BAND EVER). DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM UNLESS YOUR 13 YEARS OLD AND HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO...."
5,And the best is yet to come!,"With their first CD Linkin Park were hailed as pioneers and they've just blown that out of the water with ""Meteora"". This CD builds on the first and takes what the band have learnt and shared to another level.Meteora is an amazing album and the catchy riffs and thumping bass lines will have you, literally, jumping around your room. This is another ""hit the road at a dangerously high speed and don't look back"" type album!The wicked thing is the DVD. It gives fans a real insight into the world of Linkin Park and the creative process. It's really interesting to watch.But yeah, the CD rocks, the DVD's cool! Need I say more?"
1,"Backstreet's back, with an egde","Has anyone noticed that these guys are a boy band? they were put together by a record label to cash in on the ""nu-metal"" trend. if you're going to wallow in teen angst, at least pick something sincere, like NIN's Downward Spiral. It's much darker than the synthpop fantasy land spun by these guys."
2,"Well, It's Linkin Park, so it will sell gazillions.......","I must admit, I don't like Linkin Park. All their songs sound very similar. They're overall pretty good, but nothing you want to spend money on. And to top it all off, this CD is only 35 minutes long. If you bought Hybrid Theory, and liked it, I suppose you'll buy this one too. But anyone else, don't buy it. They really aren't that good."
5,KICKA$$,"Linkin park again comes back with fresh beats, lyrics and of course hard rock! Only if you are a true LP fan you will loove this album! I disagree with the past review's they are LAME! LP definetly worked for this one! My favorite cuts off the album include ""somewhere I belong"" along with ""Nobody's Listening"" and of course ""Faint"" with the japanese flutes in the background. Trust me its worth a buy!!! If you are a true LP fan you will love and respect the hard work spent to make this album great! LP ROCKS!"
2,WHAT THE HECK?,"Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory was definitely their best cd. Reannimation was released after that, which isn't that great of an album, due to the fact that the cd is mainly rap. Now they released their 2nd studio album almost 2 and a half years later. This album, in my opinion, has maybe 2 or 3 good songs with ""Somewhere I Belong"" being the best track. So overall this cd was a huge disappointment. Not to mention the entire cd is only 36 minutes long and some songs just really suck. If they could add a few more tracks then i think the cd would be a lot better. Don't waste your money on this."
3,hybrid meteora,"the new album meteora is a copy to the hybrid theory cd and in fact that ""easier to run"" is [bad] only 3 song that strengthed this album that is somewhere i belong,lying from you and dont stay.I noticed that ""numb"" sounds a bit ""runaway"" from hybrid theory.nevertheless if you really like lp you should buy this disc.i prefer that you all listen to breaking benjamin instead of this."
4,A good second(not counting Reanimation),"This album doesn't quite live up to the debut, Hybrid Theory, it is much better than Reanimation. This is a good combination of rap/rock just like the first one. Good combination like Limp Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine. This has some great tracks like Somewhere I Belong, Faint, and Don't Say. Nobody's Listening is some of the beest rap/rock I've heard in a long time. If you're an LP fan go buy this one."
3,Power & Innovation,"My 2 words to define the music these guys put out! Not an outstanding album I believe, but still with Linkin Park's trademark I enjoy well spread. ""Somewhere I Belong"" is one of the best songs I've heard lately, ""Easier to Run"" and ""From the Inside"" are my other favorite tracks.Enter the Park and find a new dimension of music."
2,Not Real Rock,"Ok the reason that i gave Linkin Park new album ""Meteora"" a two was, first the album is around 36 minutes, second the album is not real rock like ""Smashing Pumpkins"", Or ""Nirvana"" which are true rock groups. What I mean by they are not a real rock group is that they are produced for radio, and not produced by the indy seen . The only true good song on the album is faint, which is about 2:45 minutes long, which is not enough for me, because im used to album being at least 60 minutes long not 36 minutes. PLEASE SAVE YOUR CASH ON A CD WORTH BUYING MAYBE LIKE RADIOHEAD !!!!!!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I bought this cd last night expecting another great set of powerful music, similar to Hybrid Theory. I was wrong.The whole album is only 36 minutes long. They filled the other 300mb on the cd with useless multimedia for PC. The only song that really begs to be played more then once is the single ""Somewhere I Belong."" I'm sure I'll be sick of that after it's played 8 million times on the radio. The songs just don't flow. Maybe it's just me, but this isn't the Linkin Park from Hybrid Theory."
2,Hybrid Theory with a different cover,"This really isn't much different from the previous album...................it's just that it was time that they should have come up with a new album....so they got this out....since Hybrid Theory sold millions......they made this album sound exactly the same.......it's basically an example of the record industry commercial policy.....u release an album....release a few singles........and then release the same stuff again........ i gave it two stars cuz....well recording an album takes some effort!!And anyway u cudn't hav expected a band like Linkin Park to come up with something new.......if u guys like Linkin Park and Nu Metal try n pick up albums like Believe-Disturbed,13 ways t bleed...-Cold,Around the Fur,White Pony-Deftones n other stuff like Korn,mudvayne etc....rather than spend money on this......and if u hav Hybrid Theory u'v already heard the album."
4,Jasmine's Review,"I like almost every kind of rock and this CD is very good. Some of the songs seem to be similar in ways, but they are all very good. I like Numb and Faint the best"
2,Linkin Park is great. Until you listen to real music.,"This cd has plenty of catchy tracks, namely Somewhere I Belong and Numb to name two which have also got clips.The rest of the other tracks kind of blur together.Even the good tracks on this cd can't last repeated plays, after awhile one just finds them utterly predictable.I could care less if this band made bajillions, but at least they could make their later releases somewhat different.The music aside, I recommend not reading this band's lyrics, which are utterly average and gives one a feeling that the band members perhaps hired angsty high school teens to write their lyrics for them"
3,No where near hybrid theory,"After the success of ""Hybrid theory"",it was obvious that big things were expected from linkin park's sophmore effort.It was always going to be difficult to make an album that would top the first time effort.And to be honest i dont think these guys hav.This album is short,only 37 minutes long.Most of the songs have Mike Shinoda rapping more often then chester sings and it just doesnt feel like a real metal album.it seems as if creativity is lacking and not enough effort was put into writing the songs.However a few songs and the lone fact that this band consists of some talented musicians saves this album.It's still worth a listen for hardcore fans of linkin park inspite of all the above mentioned flaws."
4,Still COOOOOOL!!!!!,"Most of the songs are good but nobody's listening and session didn't get my attention. I think Hybrid Theory is a bit better then Meteora,I would give Hybrid Theory five stars.But Meteora still rocks!LINKIN PARK IS THE REAL ROCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,good....but not as good as hybrid theory,"I think Hybrid Theory is better then Meteora. But Meteora has a good flow to it. The songs are slower then the ones on Hybrid Theory. Like, easier to run, somewhere i belong, from the inside, and numb. Well I don't wanna say slower, the right words would be slow and hard. Everyones heard ""numb"" it's kind of slower but hard, right. Personally my favorites are ""Don't Stay"" ""Hit the Floor"" ""Faint(all the way, best song)"" ""Figure.09"" ""Session"""
5,Meteora hits heavy,"With the follow up to their smash major label debut, Linkin Park delivers once again with ""Meteora"". With more of an electric sound than its predecessor, ""Hybrid Theory"", ""Meteora"" blends Chester's smooth voice, Mike's hard hitting vocal style, and the musical talents of the band into something altogether astounding. Highlights include the first single ""Somewhere I Belong"", ""Numb"", and ""Easier to Run"", but the entire album is catchy yet dark, which makes for easy repeat playing in your car CD player. In other words, GET.IT.Now."
4,Is there any more?,"I just bought the new Linkin Park cd last night, and musically it is incredible. The samples are beat, the beats are harder and more complex, the lyrics still contain their usual biting qualities, but there is one thing lacking: This cd is in total only 36 minutes long. For a band that took 2 years to make this cd, that is a short time. I realize with touring and pressures from the record company, and Reanimation, etc., that the time to write this cd was limited, but had this cd been a couple tracks longer, or maybe even some of the songs 30-40 seconds longer, this cd would be on the same level as Hybrid Theory. Despite all that, still an incredible cd."
3,Unimpressed,"Linkin Park is known for their first cd, Hybrid Theory, which is a plethora of studio enhanced rock hits. Well, if you like manufactured music, this cd is for you. Yes, I am sure its going to have the same sort of songs. In fact, there are songs on this album which have the same chord progressions as some of their previous hits from their first album. It is definately a studio ploy to make more hits. For example, track 13 ""Numb"" will be the predecessor to the single ""Crawling"". It's not a bad cd, but its very generic."
2,Sad,"This CD is a perefct example of why alot of folks hate new metal. First there's the drums. Like most new metal bands they are processed and myre the depth of the music and overal quality of the alledged metal feel. The lyrics are just what every drama queen teenage punk wants to hear. Wich is pure uncontrolled emeotional despair and rage. Not only is it annoying and cliche, but it takes very little skill to write. The giutars are an improvment from Hybrid Theory, hats off to them for elvoving in that department at least. But they are still simplistic to the point of limiting the replay value significantly.All in all....It's a notch above other new metal bands at best, and a slap in the face to music in general at worst. You decide."
2,"Sounds like Hybrid Theory, but much, much, weaker","Most of the songs on this album sounds kind of like Hybrid Theory, but with more rap and less metal. And is you listen to songs like Figure.09, Numb, Easier To Run, and Don't Stay; they sound exactly like One Step Closer, Pushing Me Away, Crawling, and Runaway with Chester singing depressed and sad. On Hybrid Theory, it was more screaming like ""SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU"" and now it's something softer. Really weak. Big Downfall."
1,this is the worst album ive ever seen,crap guitardroopy bassdisgraceful drummingmediocre vocalspedestrian lyrics
2,I'm being VERY gereous with the rating,"I promise you, I am being VERY generous with the rating...All I have to say is: What happened to the band who had so much success with Hybrid Theory and Reanimation? This piece of crap, lame excuse for a CD is NOTHING like their older CDs were...those older CDs were actually good, I won't say they were #1, top of the world quality, I was waiting to name their next CD the undisputed top-of-the charts winner, but obviously that won't be the case."
2,"wow, these guys realy fooled the rest of you","two words: talent, ingenuityi used to be a fan of LP till i learnd a little bit on the gitar, then listend to their album again and realized how much this band lacks both of them.This album shows how overused crappy electronica work can fool you kids into thinking this band can actually play an instrument.The rock parts are unbeliveably bland, and the rap parts are even blander if that could be at all possible.Emotion? Hell, any band can make corperatized, recycled and shrink wrapped in FMized lyrics that appeal to gajillion and a half 13 year olds and call it emotional. Phh, i can get more real emotion out of C-SPAN and CNN. This album is bull****"
1,Meat Me At Ora,"This band roks man!!! Its soo hardcore and aww some!!!! Ill love it when the chinesse man get up there and raps lick no to or row!! :( It so good if u like heavy METAL and such, then stick rap into a molded blender and mix it up, what do you get?!?!? AWW SOME!!! thats what!! Chester Hollyfield is the better sing these days... So what r u waitng for go waste 20$!! Hurry!!!"
5,Rewind that...I want to listen to it again...,This cd is so addictive...I can't stop listening to it...Linkin Park is a hit and will always be my favorite rock band.
3,Expected more...,"Linkin Park's new album, ""Meteora,"" is alike in many ways to the first one. Not to say that this CD is terrible, but the album is nothing revolutionary. It's just more of the same. There are some catchy songs on the album though and they're good enough to keep you listening for a bit. After a while though, it really starts to grow out on you and then you figure, why did I buy this album? Actually, that's just me, but if you're going to buy it, thinking this album will be as good as the first one, forget about it. Many of the songs sounds simliar to the first one. One of them sounds just like ""A Place For My Head."" I tried sining the chorus from that song into one of the songs from the new one, and it actually went! The same notes were on that same song as well. Would I reccommend it? Sure, why not. If you're into this type of music, you'll definitely like it. I just expected a lot more from it, but I was a bit disappointed."
5,EVERY DAMN SONG COULD BE A SINGLE!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an amazing album. From begining to end, it's awesome. Mike's rapping couldn't be tighter and Chester's vocals and lyrics are flawless. This record is filled with 12 off-the-hook songs. All of which could be singles (yes, even ""Sessions""). My personal favorite is ""Lying From You"". This song combines the genius collaboration of Mike and Chester to perfection. My only ""complaint"" is that the record is a little short, but that's quickly overlooked by excellent song writing and great production. Anyone who slams this record should never be allowed near a music store agian. I'd give this record a 10 if I could."
1,Labeling this band and this album as Metal is a travesty,"Linkin Park is in no way heavy, nor are they metal. This is really overrated, overplayed pop. Chester sounds awful with his constant screaming, and the lyrics are poor. If LP really wants to impress me, let them start by making an album with substance. For example, writing more than just a bunch of songs about how they're outcasts or how they suffer from huge amounts of angst on a day-to-day basis."
1,quite possibly the worst thing known to mankind...,"im a geek. but these guys look like the dorks that we in the chess club used to beat up. i laugh everytime I see a video of these guys..har har...seriously i miss the early 90s. we had nirvana, pearl jam, soundgarden, etc on the radio and seinfeld on primetime tv. now we have nsync, these dorks, blink 1827, third eye way blind, limp bisquick (all above r just nsync with guitars) and Friends on primetime. god help us all...everyone..."
5,A great CD,"this is another great CD put out by the boys in Linkin Park. This isn't quite as good as Hybrid Theory(but what is) but it still is a great CD. Don't burn it go out and buy it its worth it. Thanks Mike, Chester, Brad, Phoenix, Rob, and Joe."
1,TERRIBLE! please don't buy it,"Just as bad as Hybrid Theory. Maybe worse... These guys are wannabe's at metal. It's sad Metallica toured with these queers. I still feel sorry for you little kids who think this is awesome. What's next, Papa Roach becoming metalcore?kids get a life"
1,Come On People!!,"If a band like Linkin Park is successful in America, it obviously shows that there is something wrong with the music scene here. I cannot pick out one element of Linkin Park's music which makes their sound attractive enough for people to actually buy their CDs. You have 2 vocalists (i'm sorry, 1 of them is a rapper, pssh) who constantly whine about broken relationships. They might as well hire 2 neutered cats for vocals. I really wonder if current Linkin Park fans (mostly the tone deaf) think this band is going to be around forever. They'll drop off the face of the earth like Jesus Jones did in late 1991. I guarantee this. At least Linkin Park couldn't hold a candle in the wind to Jesus Jones, who at least had substance and depth in their music."
2,"Linkin Park hits Mainstream, and hard","Linkin Park has always been a favorite of mine, from their early EP to their days in 2000 when Hybrid Theory was released and before it went huge. ""Meteora"" has a lot of hybrid sounds, but doesn't have the roots of LP. Too me, the background effects put on by Mr. Hahn are spectacular, but Shinoda's lyrics have changed, and so has their sound. I think this album is a big version of the song, ""In The End."" Its too soft and melodic for true numetal or rock fans. Although it is appealing to listen to while relaxing, the true rocker and old school LP fan will find this album to be very disappointing. Those Grey Daze are coming back faster than we know it."
3,Good Album Cover ; Better Than Expectations,"""Breaking The Habit"" and ""Don't Stay"" are my two favourite songs on this album. Breaking The Habit made me realise I don't dislike this band just for the sake of disliking them like most people do. They're a rock band and are gonna be around whether I like it or not.Other tolerable songs on this album are Lying From you.Session is a great instrumental track. Linkin Park aren't bad by any means besides Mike Schinoda and juvenile rapping.""Breaking The Habit"" is interesting because it's larger than what they are capable of. ""Don't Stay"" is a catchy song. Yeah I know its not a respectful word but I don't expect a ""One Day Remains"" (Alter Bridge) or Train Of Thought(Dream Theater) from Linkin Park."
5,Awesome!,I bought this CD today and I was very awesome. It is alot more hip hop but is one of Linkin Parks finest. It also has alot of extras and is well worth the money.
5,Needs More stars!!,"Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda, Joe Hahn, Pheonix, Rob and Brad have really done it again!!! A Sweeet follow up to ""Hybrid Theory"" for real!! This sophmore album is just a step up the ladder for Linkin Park. Check out all the tracks except ""Nobody's Listening."" That one could have been left out. The whole record has that harsh LP sound that you just know when you hear. Trust me, Buy it, love it and whatever you do...don't lend it out!"
4,Meteora,Meteora takes more of the rap side for me mike has come far on his lyrics and chester is always riping it up on his screams . There are also some songs with chester which bring out his more beautiful side...Keep it up...
4,Dagger Dias reviews Linkin Park's Meteora,"This is linkin parks best cd, its even better than hybrid theory and collision course.Don't Stay - 10/10Somewhere I Belong - 9/10Lying From You - 9/10Hit The Floor - 6/10Easier To Run - 7/10Faint - 50/10 (yes, its THAT good!)Figure 9 - 8/10Breaking The Habit - 7/10From The Inside - 6/10Nobody's Listening - 9/10Session - 10/10Numb - 20/10 (Yes its THAT good, almost as good as Faint!)This is the most original of linkin parks cds because with the exception of ""Lying from you"" , ""Numb"" , ""Faint"" all got remixed on the jay-Z linkin park collision course cd, but every other track on this disc is original and does not have a remix (unlike hybrid theory, which had the entire disc remixed on its evil twin, reanimation.)over all great, so go buy it!~ Dagger Dias"
4,Another Hit From Linkin Park,"Once again, Linkin Park has created another album worth owning. To those who critize this album or Linkin Park's talent in general, you do not know good music when you hear it. Linkin Park's style changes in some songs, the most noticeable being ""Nobody's Listening."" Linkin Park misses on that one, and I kind of think the forward is a little unnecessary. Other than that, Linkin Park scores on just about everything else. My favorite tracks are ""Breaking the Habit"" and ""Numb."" ""From the Inside"" is really well done too. Overall, another good album by Linkin Park that is worth owning."
4,One step down from being a Hybrid....,"This cd was good until the radio ruined all the songs by overplaying them. That said, it has never been as good as Hybrid theory, but it isn't bad. It's just different. There are some good ones on here and there are some bad ones on here (a characteristic Hybrid Theory doesn't share). The best song is Lying from You, because it sounds the closest to HBT. It's a new sound, and even though it isn't as good, it could be for the best. Cut them some slack, how can you follow up a HBT? I'ts pretty hard to do, and I think they did a pretty good job. I would definitely buy HBT before you buy this. One other comment, I haven't taken this out since January, whereas I am listening to Hybrid Theory right now. This one gets older faster."
5,WOW.,"I'm amazed that somehow the band have managed to come up with an album that easily matches Hybrid Theory and Reanimation in its raw power. Considering they had 2 years to make it, compared to 10+ years for the first album, its a pretty good effort. I don't really have a favourite as every Linkin Park song bears the same trademark skill of production, lyrical perfection and sonic power. The amazing thing is, there is NO filler. I just hope their next artist album is a bit heavier, as Meteora is alot softer than Hybrid, the sound I fell in love with first. Linkin Park have proven their talent with the release of Meteora."
5,THIRD CD AND STILL STRONG!!!!!!!!!!,"i am the number one linkin park fan and i just gotta say they do it again. i'm tired of everybody saying...""oh the songs are too short"" or...""all chester does is yell."" well i gotta say this they get to the point!!! that's what makes them the best band. they just say what they feel inside and make it short and sweet. not like all the other rappers and other bands who take 4 to 5 minutes to add who they hate or having to say cuss words. b/c all the songs that last from the four to five minutes tend to just blah blah through it and say the samething over and over again...what's good about that! NOTHING AGAINST EMINEM THOUGH. i have much love for him. but the main reason i love this band is because they take a lot into one. they can make a rave, a rock concert, and hip-hop format together. THAT'S INCREDIBLE TALENT. and no cussing...gotta love that!!! IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CD...GET IT!!!!!!"
1,Horrible attempt at music,"All you posers that like this putrid music are insanely ignorant. This is horrible ""music"" with very little musical skill, and whiny crybaby lyrics to boot.Not only are they the most horrible live band ever, but they whine in EVERY song. Why would anyone want to listen to this disgusting insult of a band? Go pick up a Slayer, Vader, or Morbid Angel album. If that's too brutal for you (which it probably will be) then go pick up a Dream Theater or Tool album. That is good music which requires skill and precision to pull off. LINKIN PARK [...]"
4,Wasn't as good as I expected.,"Maybe I'm growing up and leaving nu metal behind (I don't like ""Hibrid Theory"" as much now), but this album is not as good as the radio singles predict.Linkin Park used what they do best: catchy rap verses with melodic sing-along choruses. The only problem is that the formula gets boring after a while.THere are different songs, one is pure hip-hop, the last track is pure rock, and a few more experimental tracks. Other than that the album goes on what Hibrid Theory did, recreating it, but going further in it.I liked the album, and I recomend it to whoever liked Hibrid Theory, yet again if you didn't don't think that these kids have grown up...Highlights: ""Faint"""
2,"Not One Step Closer, more like One Step Back...","I don't think I found a single memorable track on this c.d.! I remember buying it and sitting there waiting for a track as good as, say, ""One Step Closer."" Well I listened to the whole album six times and was badly disappointed.Not only is a big step in the wrong direction for Linkin Park, but everything sounds forced and generic. Maybe it's just me, but I felt they could have done a lot better.Nothing stood out on this album to me.I threw it out after struggling to make it half way through a seventh time in an attempt to find something beyond average... aren't these guys supposed to go on tour with Metallica this summer? Hell, they better just play stuff from Hybrid theory and perhaps some of the Reanimation remix stuff unless they plan on putting the crowd to sleep."
2,mmm... no,"I don`t care too much about this band, I like rap-metal but this is not a good way to recognize it. Korn`s nu metal was an innovation, and it inspired some good bands like Limp Bizkit and System of a Down, but this one seems to be something like POP. Hybrid Theory was OK, but this one is not heavy metal..."
5,Why!?,"It makes me angry that intelligent people like the ones who comment in this demoralize this obviously talented band by writing such idiotic comments as ""they just suck."" Gee, thanks for the info. If you hate it so much, why are you even typing the ridiculous crap which was spewing from your keyboard when you wrote the review? To the ones who can actually spell: Perhaps you are older than six. You're forgiven. For the time being. Get better tastes in music, or stop posting crap. Please.This is an amazing album, with sounds from the hip-hop beats of ""Nobody's Listening"" to the rock styled sounds of ""Faint"". Get the album, listen to the lyrics. They actually say something. Intriguing, no?"
1,I wish I could retain the one star I have been forced to Giv,"this is like a gaping hole in my colon, a mix of green deep-lunged phlegm covered with specs of blood and various body fluids. That is the best way to describe Lincoln Pork. So bad and ridicuously cheesey, it literally causes intestinal pain. This is Poison for the new milenium, Triumph with a turntable, Survivor without Rocky. Just lame, uninspired corporate rock. If you are a vacuous braindead automoton looking for the album all your little friends will have, go buy it. Hey wait, wasn't that the same strategy they used to sell Pokemon ? Down with corporate rock."
5,Meteora,"First off, I have to say that even though I gave this album 5 stars, Linkin Park will never be able to outdo themselves on Hybrid Theory. Every song on Hybrid Theory was well wrote, played and sung. Although Meteora is a VERY good CD and well worth the money, the songs just aren't as catchy as the ones on this album.Don't Stay: 4/5Somewhere I Belong: 4/5Lying From You: 5/5Hit The Floor: 3/5Easier To Run: 3/5Faint: 5/5Figure .09: 5/5Breaking The Habit: 4/5From The Inside: 4/5Nobody's Listening: 5/5Session: 4/5Numb: 5/5This is a very well put together CD. My personal favorites are Figure .09, Lying From You, and Faint. If you liked Hybrid Theory you will definitely like this album, but don't expect anything much better."
2,kind of disappointed,"after 2 1/2 years all they could muster was 36 minutes. Somewhere I Belong and Don't Stay, Faint, and Numb are really the only tracks worth listening to over and over and if it was not for those 4 songs this album would be a complete waste. Hopefully they did not commit career suicide by doing this. Fans expected at least close to an hour of what they came to expect from these guys which is maybe a little heavier than Hybrid in some cases and mellower in others. I am a little worried that we will wait another 2 1/2 years for another project and it will be only 20 minutes."
5,Linkin Park does it again...,"Wow. As spectacular and innovative as ""Hybrid Theory"" was, and as good-but-not-Hybrid-Theory-good as ""Reanimation"" was, I can safely say that ""Meteora"" is the equivalant of those two CDs combined and multiplied to the tenth power. It's that good. The enhanced version has the DVD about the making of the CD, and that's always a welcome addition since the CD and DVD package is about the normal price I spend on CDs. The price for the CD itself is exceptionally low as well, but since it's Linkin Park, it really doesn't matter what the price is, is it? A VERY deserving CD in my collection."
4,A satisfying followup to the let-down Reanimation,"I waited weeks and weeks for this CD. Here I am sitting at my computer listening to it, and happy I ran to buy it after school. The only songs I don't like are Session, a follow to Cure for the itch, and number 9 track with the weird flute. This is though overall a very satisfying album that proves Linkin Park isn't a Hybrid-hit band only."
5,THIS CD ROCKS !!! IT IS SO AWESOME !!! I LOVE IT !!!,"This is one of the best CDs I have ever bought. I would recommend it to anyone. I love every song on this CD. I also like Linkin Parks other CDs, but so far this is the best one.Money very worth spending. Go get one - you will not be disappointed. It's funny too because I've never heard of them till recently when this CD came out and a friend let me listen to it. I was instantly hooked."
2,It Sucked OVERRATED,"This band just comes in here thinkin their the best band in the world and think that they can reach up to Metallica or Nirvana or even Pantera. Next thing you know they might think there sellin 4,000,000 copies a day on 1 album.... yeah right....If you wont real music get these:Metallica, Nirvana,Pantera,System of a Down,Alice in Chains, or KoRn.get them and you Will thank me you are not listening to this whiny little screaming nerd band.The only rap/rock band I even listen to is the old style limpbizkit like Significant Other or 3 doller bill."
1,Oh Yuk!,"I bought this album because I read so many good reviews, but I have to tell you I am very unimpressed. I definitely enjoyed their first album, but this is a very lame follow-up. I can tell that they tried too hard on this album, and didn't let things flow. I definitely would not recommend this album. Buy something different."
5,Best Cd ever made period.,"Anyone who gives this cd less than 3 out of five stars is a fag. This is better than the debut album. The debut album was formerly the best cd ever made. For anyone who likes alternative metal, buy this! Numb, Lying From You and Faint are by far the best songs on here. Especially Numb. Also, to any other LP maniacs, if you haven't bought Collision Course, buy it. Unless you hate rap."
4,Not as good as Hybrid Theory,"I won't go into details. It's not as good as Hybrid Theory, but still a good CD."
4,"SHORT, BUT GOOD...","SINCERILY, I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS IS A DAMN GOOD ALBUM, BUT IF THE LENGHT TIME OF THE SONGS IN THE CD WERE A LITTLE MORE LONGER IT WOULDVE BEEN BETTER. I HAVE TO ADMIT ALSO THAT THIS CD IS WAY DARKER THAN THE OTHER WAY, WHICH IS COOL, CUZ I LIKE HEAVY MUSIC.MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE ""DONT STAY"", ""LYING FROM YOU"", ""BREAKING THE HABIT"", AND ""FAINT"". ALSO, DONT MISS THE LIVE CD LIVE IN TEXAS, WHICH IS PRETTY DAMN COOL ALSO.-AGUANTE LA ANARQUIA SAS 07!!!"
4,~Better than Most~,"I am a big fan of Linkin Park, due to word of mouth, I went out n bought Hybrid Theory before they had much air play. I began listenin to it n it blew me away, its awesome, This is the best of both worlds(rOcK N rAp)i kept thinkin to myself. Then when Reanimation came out i was too hyped i listened to that one even more made me apperciate each song for what they are worth. I couldnt wait to hear Meteora, LP's sound is untouchable from the rest that try to follow in the rap/rock trend. They take it to a higher level, mix it all up n create a tight cd. This cd is great with a few things missing: collaborations, scratchin riffs and more tracks. I cant get enuff of LP. I love the back beat of Lyin from U , what i was lookin foward to, I dont have an actual fav of the whole cd i love em all, n for the haters, This cd is #1 on the charts for a reason, u should reconsider ur comments, n u will get hooked on METEORA. Project Revolution!"
5,VERY GOOD ALBUM,GOT THIS ALBUM THE DAY IT CAME OUT AND I WAS NOT DISSAPPOINTED. JUST LIKE HYBRID THEORY I LIKE EVERY SONG ON THE CD. BUT AGAIN I FEEL AS IF THE ALBUM SHOULD BE LONGER THEN 30 MIN. THIS ALBUM TO ME IS BETTER THEN HYBRID THEORY.
5,plain awesome,"plain perfection, great rap, nice rock, and unmentionable metal and sound. i bought this after i got hooked to faint and somewhere i belong, i wasn't dissapointed. numb is also very good. if you like this you should get hybrid theory its as good as this with in the end, crawling, more buy this i f you like hrd rock, awesome"
2,same thing,"Has anyone else noticed how much their songs resemble each other? listen to hybrid theory then meteora and you will find that they are practically the same songs with diffrent words. even the songs on meteora have a striking resemblence to eachother. also what the hell is with chester? if he would just chill out every once in a while and not scream then the band would be a lot better. the only reason i give this cd two stars is because they are awesome instraumentally, specially MR HAHN. maybe if they cut all the vocals and especially chesters out, i would like tis cd. take my advice dont buy it unless they come out with an instraumental version."
4,Linkin's Back,"Linkin Park's new album is so awesome. They have sample some really awesome beats. All the songs are very much like what they have done in the past, but that's what's great about it. They didn't change their sound. The only thing I don't like ,is that it's only 36 mins long. There's pop albums longer then that. If you haven't gotten this cd yet, get it, it's so worth ur money."
2,Not what I expected(and hoped),"This album in all honesty is weak. It hardly shows any maturity from Hybrid Theory, and in truth is a degradation from HT. After hearing many hypes of LP trying new things and reinventing themselves, this album is 36 minutes of the same stuff over and over. Don't get me wrong, ""Somewhere I Belong"" is good and classic LP at that, but a whole album of the same stuff gets old. But its okay, I have faith in LP that they will take bolder steps next album and become a more matured band like Incubus. Right now, they're stuck in a rut, doing what Limp Bizkit would do. They're immensely talented, but songs that go rap-chorus-rap-chorus-bridge-chorus everytime get old. These guys are great, which is why I'm holding them to a higher standard than everyone else.Bottom Line: Linkin Park is good, but this album fails. It will get a few plays and I'll forget about it."
3,eh...,"It's not bad. Some good songs, some bad ones. Lying From You and Breaking the Habit are pretty good. Easier to Run blows. All other songs are either average, alright or kinda bad. Linkin Park is ok, but they get played way too much. I just hope Lying From You doesn't become yet another played-to-death single...."
5,Very impressive,"No one hated LP more than I did after they released the same album like 10 times with just re-mixing the songs. I wrote them off as just another one-hit wonder. I was a HUGE fan of Their first album and was completely let down with their other releases. As soon I popped this on in the cd player, I was immediately impressed. Since then, i have heard the cd through like 10 times and each time I like it even MORE!! This album is AMAZING!! I proably like it better than the first. Good job LP!"
4,Excellent and fresh Linkin Park!!,"Meteora is excellent. The songs are very good and flow right into each other, making it very enjoyable to listen to the whole album right through. The songs may sound different from what Linkin Park has originally played, but you will get used to it and will love it after listening to it for a couple of times. Somewhere I Belong is an amazing song, and so are Lying From You, Faint, and Nobody's Listening. I highly recommend buying this CD if you like Linkin Park and even if you don't. This is the best Linkin Park album yet."
3,No.,"Linkin Park is a talented band that takes a lot of time to perfect their music. So my question is, why is this so short? The CD is about 4 minutes shy of 40 minutes. Reanimation was about an hour and Hybrid Theory was 40 minutes, making Meteora the shortest LP album availible. The DVD was interesting but not worth the extra cash. You're not going to watch it more than twice. I suggest going to a friends house and watching it and buying the regular version of the CD. In some ways I felt robbed after I bought this CD. All the songs essentialy had the same sound to them as Hybrid Theory since they were created back before Hybrid was even released. (Lyrics and beats.) If you ask me I think you should keep the money. You hear most of the songs on the radio anyway and there just isn't enough meat to make it a worthy puchase. I do however reccomend it to die hard Linkin Park fans. Let's hope LP makes a long and fresh Junior album in the future."
4,Good Follow-up,"It is unlikely that you won't like this new album by Linkin Park if you liked ""Hybrid Theory"". The blend of rap and nu-metal is there. The winning formula is intact. A great follow-up to a good debut album. Get it!"
3,meteora,i thought that the cd was okay. For a person that is not used to listening to rock it was okay. There were a few songs that i did like. The first one was #2 Don't Stay because of the fast pace and the lyrics. The second song was #3 Somewhere I Belong becasue it sounds like something the average teenager can relate to. Number 7 Faint just because no particular reason. Figure 09 because of the lyrics and the music. Nobody's Listening and Numb were the other two songs that I liked on the album.
3,i guess i should say yipeee-yay for 37 minutes of music?,"This album is iffy in my opinion. My big complaint is....in 2 years all they can come up with is 37 minutes? that is whack, its about as bad as them coming out with a remix of their debut album after like a year. They just cant let hybrid theory go so they remix it and think that it will satisfy their fans. I have to admit the songs rock on meteora but just so short it brings the whole record down. Dont waste money on this album, just burn it from a friend like I did, no sense in paying so much for this. This record brings one question.....CAN LINKIN PARK CREATE A CD THAT LASTS LONGER THAN 40 MINUTES? obviously not"
1,I finally see the weakness in this band,"Several months ago I saw them at Live8 and saw them perform, and I was sold that this band is not metal at all. The only instrument this band needs is a dj because one thing I noticed is that no one was playing an instrument during a song and how the hell you call yourself a rock band? Any hoo, the songs really got old fast and annoying which brings me to the vocalist, Chester can't sing and has a pathetic girlish growl and sceaming is his only skill(sidenote doctors recommended to chester not to scream or his stomach might kill him). But the reason I stopped liking them was the album with Jay-z, I hate Jay z's guts and anyone around him. I suggest anything from Tool, Slayer and Pantera instead for real metal."
1,Booo.........,"I really dont get this new music. Screaming in a microphone about breaking a habit is not what I call music. I have so much to say...but I know Ill just piss you guys off. This music sucks....ok? Rap sucks too.... got it? Real rock music was at its perfecting in the early 70's. Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix all saw the meaning of music and life. This meaningless Linkin Park crap...is just....loud and irritating. Plus they are sell outs! God damn this band sucks...."
1,Dear Members of Linkin Park,"Up to 1995 the Rock musis in general was awesome. Then one day you and another gay-ass fakers like you (Limp Bizkit, Blink182, Good Charlotte, Creed and etc.) came and ruined it, arn't yo ashamed?! Many morons tell me you are so talented, but there is no one talented in your band but that nerd that sits all the day on the computer and mixes your bad music. BTW DJ in a rock band?!?! What the f**k?!?! Anyway the vocals are awful and sound like rap (This Mix of rock and rap sucks), The guitarist espcially sucks, did he ever took guitar lessons?? He always play the same chords and he plays only in the choruses. Oh yeah.. the bass, I found that he knows to play only 4 sounds on his bass guitar, he repeats the on every song.BTW since you made a discrace to the rock music and rap music, the best thing you can do is to get on the 10th floor of a building and jump (Without Parachute!!) Please do it, I and a lot of people will be soooooooo happy. THANK YOU(...)"
1,dont get this crap.........ever!!!!!!!!! (-infinte stars),i hate linkin park. this crap sucks. if you want to listin to some REAL rock music get one of the following1. Lamb Of God2. Korn3. Cradle Of Filth4. System Of A Down5. Fear Factory6. Mudvayne7. Slipknot8. Static-X9. Trivium10. other metal bands you can think ofthose bands are over 100% better than this wanna-be metal banda d.j. in a band what the hell were they thinking. linkin park introduced me to rock. this is to soft for this rock. get satan's music like the listed bands. those bands rock. why did i like linkin park in the first place. do not get any of linkin park's c.d. get the listed bands instead.im not 13 for god sake im 18. i dont want to join to amazon
1,Spare me........,"I find it simply disguisting that anyone could consider this ill-composed, annoying abomination of a cd worth any sort of praise musically. This band is so inept of talent it makes me sick. For someone to actually compare this rap/pop whatever sort of waste you consider it, to a great composer is an abomination. Simply put, a very overrated band that does not have enough talent or creativity to fill a thimble. If you have any respect for music, letalone self respect, you will never consider buying this cd. If I could give this a negative rating, it would certainly be in the deepest negative one could ever imagine."
1,"The worst band in music today, and you all know it too","Linkin Park's ""Hybrid Theory"" was the definition of made for radio wanna be hard rock that has no real emotion or soul to it. ""Meteora"" continues this trend, and by the time this review is published the album will most likely have gone platinum. This time around the album is packed full of poorly sampled blips and sounds that are mixed in with the more annoying than usual rapping, repetitive down tuned guitars, and inconsistent drumming that people the world over have grown to love. Chester Bennington, who I had said before had a unique voice and is quite talented, sounds tired and plain old uninspired here, and the band is so poorly knit that it is plainly clear that ""Meteora"" was released just to make money and get on the radio. This isn't hard rock. This isn't metal. And none of these guys are Mike Patton (the other vocalist whose name slips my memory seems to try to mimic him more and more). Linkin Park is only part of a trend....."
1,"This is what is known as ""pop music""","The editorial review for this album says that Linkin Park is what Trent Reznor has always been afraid of becoming. There is a reason for that, you know. An innovative and talented artist like him should be afraid to become a talentless, unimaginative, and corny musical act like Linkin Park. Seriously, all of you LP fanatics have to hear how comically monotonous the lyrics are on this album. They sound like 3rd graders wrote them, maybe they did. Some people have said that Linkin Park has saved metal. Actually, in a roundabout way, they might be right. Hopefully, people will listen to this garbage and swear off pop rock like this forever and go buy more acutal metal CD's. Yeah, go Linkin Park!"
1,It doesn't even merit a star,I can't for the life of me understand why people listen to this band. No talent whatsoever. Avoid this.
1,ja rule ruls,linkin park slipknot punk suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk gte jar ule r.u.l.e. col cd meteoa by linkin park SUCKSKKS!!
1,"Linkin Park Falls Short, As Always","Linkin Park simply put: SUCKS. Although an immature choice of words, it's true. Power chords, uncreative lyrics-it's the same mediocre ""music"" over and over again. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone with the ability to hear. But If you're a Linkin Park fan, go ahead, indulge yourself in this horrible slop of crap again."
2,Meteora..... more like Mediocre!,"I have to say I liked the first CD. It was shamefully ""popy"". OK, call ""INSYNC Metal"", but it was good and edgy. This one just made me yawn. Much like Korn, Rage Against the Machine, Limp Bizkit etc..., their first CD is the most memorable and certainly their most fresh and innovative. I guess does go to your head, too bad it doest improve thier music!"
2,The same song 13 times,"Alright so Im gunna sum up this album in one quick blue print1. Little instramental before song2. Slow singing3. Singning picks up4. Chorus5. Back to the way 3 was4. Chorus5. Bout 20 seconds of screaming6. Chorus7. FadeDon't agree? Play ""Numb"" and ""Breaking the Habit"" at the same time. Its the same song, different rythm.With that said I'd like to say, before all you fans kill me, that I liked LP's debut, but they're just another band to be added to the millions cranked through the system and spit out a ""hit"" producing machine."
1,SAME OLD.....,"Meteora sounds exactly like Hybrid Theory, only not even as good. Not worth the money....I was really disappointed. Linkin Park needs to seriously work on some NEW stuff."
3,Its no Hybrid Theory,"There are a couple songs i like on this cd such as figure 0.9, dont stay, nobody's listening, and somewhere i belong, but when you compare this album to hybrid theory, it doesn't even come close. Hybrid Theory in my opinion was one of the best albums ever. Every song on Hybrid Theory was capable of being a top single. This cd had an exceptional number of good songs (4), which is why i gave it three stars and not one or two. Is it worth buying? If your a linkin park fan like myself, then yes."
2,kind of dorky,"if you've heard one song from these guys, then you've heard them all. if you're really into them, but don't have money to spare; well you're not going to get any new music anyway if you own any other linkin park.ralph from the simpsons stated it best ""...i'm happy and angry!"""
1,what was i thinking?!?!?!?!??!,"Linkin Park suck so much ass. the the sad part is that linkin park introduced me into rock. man, what the hell was i thinking. everyday one kid in my class play linkin park every single day. linkin park this. linkin park that. linkin park suck ass. i hate the rock-rap crap. not my taste. but right now im listening to real rock like System of a Down, Korn, Cradle of Filth, Mudvayne, Slipknot, get those albums instead of this crap.i would get it no stars but i have to stick it with one."
1,It's sort of interesting really.,"Yep, it's sort of interesting that in the short, short space of thirty-six minutes, Linkin Park still manage to sound repetitive and boring. You've really got to hand it to Chester and the lads, they must really have worked hard to get it to sound this bad.I heartily recommend a band like Liquid or Deftones instead of this. In fact, I recommend pretty much anything instead of this!"
2,"I, ME and YOU Part II","I really want to like this album but it does sound TOO much like their previous effort. Secondly, and more importantly, I swear every song has a chorus of ""I, ME and YOU"". Seriously, if you pay attention to the number of times these three words are used, you'll never be able to listen to the album again!! Don't say I didn't warn you. Someone should go on Amazon and buy these fellas a book by Webster."
1,Don't waste your time!!!,"To those wanna rock, get other CDs instead. Open your horizons beyond just MTV, there are way better releases, i.e. Chimaira's The Impossibility of Reasons. Don't just listen/be a fan to have a certain degree of coolness. I personally liked the debut, but this is too much."
1,un original,i dont understand why people listen to this. Its so plain. All of their songs really do sound the same. Linkin park is the biggest formula band ive ever heard. They found what works to sell records for them and re did it for every song with a slightly different tune. sorry but i just dont get why you would think this is good at all.
1,Sounds like a Corperate Suit Act,this is another Band that Sounds so Formula Driven before they have had a chance to truly take some risks musically&this album is done really before it starts because between the vocals&raps mixed with the Musical Arrangements things are very much all the same.the best thing about this disc is that it doesn't last to long but that doesn't erase the Corperate Brass feel all over this Album.
2,Lets see here...,"Well then... I can easily say i once liked this band. I would remember times when i could sing along to these songs, but now i can easily say that you can get sick of this music pretty quick. It took ME but 3 months to cast this band aside. You can buy this album if you want, to maybe listen to it before it goes stale.This band's style is just such that if you listen to it enough, you will probably become very agitated. I listened to it for about 2 hours once and discovered myself coming out of a deep feel of impression to realize myself into a migrane. This band mixes far too many different genres into one style, and you will easily get annoyed after a while. Go ahead, be my guest, buy this album. No one's stopping you. Just remeber that in the long run, there is a slight chance that you will regret it."
3,Good but stale,"3.5 stars. Meteora has some great tracks, but as said before, it's a carbon copy of Hybrid Theory. If you didn't know which was which you couldn't tell what tracks were from which album. Every track has an equal opposite omitting the 13 second intro 'Foreward'. And once again, weak lyrics. Hey Chester, pick up a dictionary or thesarus for christ's sake. The only one who has gained any talent between Theory and Meteora is Joseph Hahn. If you're looking for something relatively fresh, I reccomend Reanimation."
4,it all comes down to linkin park,"linkin park has always had their own style of music.. hybrid theory was definatly an amazing cd and you could feel what they were talking about. meteora is the same way. if you liked hybrid theory for the lyrics and not just how hardcore they were, then odds are you will probably like meteora also. I highly recomend meteora, all the songs on the album show plenty of emotion and everyone can relate it to whatever may be going on in their lives. personally this album saved my life. so i think it is worth the money and so much more."
5,LP Rocks!!,"U people who dont know what good music go and review your crappy bands, and leave us LP fans alone. Someone aparently has way to much time on their hands, one person created at least 10 of basicaly the same review over and over, idiots!BUT, to the review, I think this is an awesome CD, one of my favs, (listening to it right now) I definatly recommend buying it. It will make you an instant LP fan. And you people dissing any of the band, they write all of their own music, unlike ur crack head bands. And *Chester Bennington* has an EXTREME voice!"
3,Mediocre at best.,"Different than the first album. More bland, more ... dj crap that makes it sound very fake, and less catchy than the first. If you liked Hybrid Theory, you might not like this one. If you liked the first single, nevertheless, you will like the album. However, if you did not and expected the album to be different than the single, you will be disappointed, as the album is full of the same riffs, played over and over. The album seems to have been made with little emotion, and the turntables are annoying throughout. Maybe one or two good songs, the rest is very average. Do check it out though, because the way music is going today, average is very good."
1,Mallcore at its Worst,"Linkin Park has succeeded in combinding the musical attributes of boy bands, gangsta rap, and Korn into one tasteless, unpalateable mess."
1,wow this.... this is unspeakably bad,"Linkin Park is an embarassment to every band they claim to be inspired by. Their rapping is pathetically substandard, even for white kids. Their electronic beats/synthlines are simplistic and formulaic. Their lyrics are self-indulgent whiney garbage remniscent of high school goth poetry. Maybe its just me, but there's nothing more annoying than faux-misery. Their sound is so overproduced and unchallenging... easily absorbed without a struggle or a brain cell utilized. The sung vocal lines remind me of any MTV happy boy band of your choosing. Basically a radio-friendly mish mash of popular genres glossed over with a pop shine aimed at pre-teens who don't know any better. But I guess what can you expect from a band that was signed to a major label after their first show.Please people, stop listening to garbage like this. It makes the RIAA think you're stupid enough to keep buying this kind of tripe..."
2,Yet another POP-Metal Band,"Ok, i gotta admmit that this review has some prejudice on it. But i'll try to get that away.Linking Park shows some good evolution in Meteora, doing this sort of ""Korn meets The Backstreet boys"" metal. In fact, one could easily say that there's no metal at all in Linking Park's approach to music. There's just a couple of heavily-distorted guitars and that's all. But that's my opinion being a metal listener.The songs are very catchy, and the guys can sing and scream like they were in a real nu-metal band (i don't like Nu metal either). So, Linking Park did a good job on this one, and there's no doubt that this album is going to be considered just great by the teenagers."
4,Another good effort,"While not as good as the first CD, it is still a pretty good effort. My favorirte is the single Somewhere I Belong & Hit the Floor."
2,Too short,"This new album is very incomplete. i would like to trade in my enhanced cd content for the rest of the music on this cd. only 37 minutes of music??? thats about half an album. the music is good and most of the songs are catchy, but every song needs to be longer, and there needs to be more go and less show..."
1,This CD [ smells],This CD [smells] and so does Linkin Park. They have no talent and are so overrated. Please buy something worth while...
5,"Meteora, well worth the wait!!","Linkin Park's second album Meteora was well worth the wait! I read Blender's review and don't listen to them. This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. I absolutely love Hybrid Theory and this sophomore album puts it to shame. There is not one filler track on the whole album. It is an unbelievable record. Mike and Chester make you feel their pain when they sing and I'm sure all of us can relate to what they sing about. I dont have one favorite track because they are all just that good!! This is an absolute must have!! If haven't already gotten it, go get it! You won't be sorry. I know it won't be leaving my CD player anytime soon!"
5,Great Sophomore effort!!!!!,I agree with many when I say you have to listen to it a couple of times to get it! I think they did a great job. They were able to come up with all the songs on this album in a year and a half. Also they had to live up to Hybrid Theory which in my opinion is one of the best rock albums. This is a band that can actually incorporate different styles of music in to one and make it sound really good. Excellent job on the cd and I recommmend it to everyone. This band is going somewhere.
5,AWSOM BLOSSOM,-First of all....36 minutes of LP is better than no LP. All the songs on this cd are gewd. LP is doing very well with their OWN sound that they themselves have established. KEEP IT GOIN!!! I recommend this 110% and agree that this is the perfect compliment to Hybrid Theory.
2,Pro Tools,"All I can say.... is that Linkin Park got a hold of ProTools and ran with it. ProTools is computer aided audio editing and mixing. It's a wonderful tool, but I attribute it's heavy use in this song like bands used synthesizers in the 80s.... way over used. This album lacks in play time and it lacks in strong lyrics. I hope their next one, if there is a next one is better."
4,Great sounding cd,"... Yes nu mental is not all that great anymore but linkin is the exception. They are the best in that caterory. ... Of course it should be based toward that because thats what made them popular. It would be dumb to change it alot, because than they could drop fast and nerver be heard of again! Ok to the abulm, its great!! if you like hybrid theroy you will like this. Its little bit more harder and has more melody. I give it a four instead of a five because of the length. Worth the money."
5,addicting album,"When i heard Linkin park was finally coming out with a new album after all this time, i was excited and nervous at the same time. Hybrid Theory was so amazing as a debut album that it seemed impossible for them to be able to produce an album that would satisfy the high expectations that all their fans had for them. Meteora has proved itself to truely be worthy of listening to. It still has some of the feel of the Hybrid Theory, but they have progressed to a higher level of music. You can tell this in songs like, Breaking the Habit and Faint. This album is extremely addicting; you play it once and it won't leave your stereo. I would have to say that Linkin park has really outdone themselves this time, and i can only expect more wonderful music from them in the years to come."
5,As Awesome As Hybrid Theory,"This is a great CD. It is well constructed and powerful, despite the fact that it is only about 37 minutes in length. This whole CD is great, it had no [bad] songs to skip. EVERY SINGLE SONG IS AMAZING in its own way. I have to admit, I didn't think that this album would live up to Hybrid Theory, but I was definitely proven wrong. Just as Hybrid Theory had done, Meteora spoke to me, pointing out things that related to my life and that were important to me. It's like they took the words I wanted to say out of my head and put them to a melody. I couldn't believe how much I could relate to it. Anyway, here is the list of tracks and the rating I gave them out of 5 stars...Don't Stay*****(5)Somewhere I Belong*****(5)Lying From You*****(5)Hit The Floor****(4)Easier To Run*****(5)Faint*****(5) (my favorite song on the CD!)Figure .09*****(5)Breaking The Habit*****(5)From The Inside*****(5)Nobody's Listening****(4)Session****(4)Numb*****(5)"
2,"Okay, but not amazing.","This CD is just okay. There's not really anything that amazing about it. The thing that was so amazing about their debut was that it had never been heard before, but this CD is just more of the same. Not that it's not worth listening to, but it's just that this CD is nothing new and amazing. I was an LP fan back when they were Hybrid Theory, and I met them all in Denver with the Kottonmouth Kings before Hybrid Theory ever came out. They're all great guys and they're very talented. But don't be fooled by other reviews saying this CD is amaing. You've heard it all before, but it is still worth listening to."
2,A poor follow up,"I liked the first linkin park album but this follow up album is [bad]. It is slow, depressing and has no quality at all. The first release off this album is 'Somewhere I Belong', and i should of known that if that was the first release the rest of the album wouldn't be much better and that was the case. To put this album into perspective take the worst songs off of the adema album, the hoobastank album and crazytown's first album and you have a quite pitiful follow up, I have given this album two stars because quite simply thier first album was that good; the phrase 'One Album Wonders' certainly comes to mind. I suggest to anyone even thinking of buying this album KEEP YOUR RECEIPT!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,very good,"this cd was very good, like the first one all the songs were very good. i like this about linkin park, in all their cds all the songs are always good. this cd was a little more rock as in screaming but it was really good. linkin parks songs are always something you can relate to."
3,Don't get me wrong...,"this is a fine cd. It just lacks the feeling Hybrid had. Hybrid theory gave you emotion in every single song while this one just doesn't have the feeling. With that said, it is still MUCH better than the other ""pop metal"" stuff out there like limp bizkit, evanesence, korn, and all that other stuff. Hybrid was one of my favorite cd's of all time, this is just average. If you like Linkin Park buy it. If you've never heard Linkin Park, get Hybrid Theory instead."
3,Ok?,"Ok,I have to admit I do like this cd but lets face it Linkin Park has lost there touch.They used to so awesome when they had those heavy metal singles out like ""Crawling"" and ""One Step Closer"".They went softie!What is up with this ""Numb"" song.Its totally a pop song.They definitley took it to the next level with the whole sampling,rapping and dj thing.With there next album they better get on the ball and pull out more guitars!"
5,JOIN LPUNDERGROUND.COM,It is great and the sound was different. I liked it and in my opinion they did a better job than with Hybrid Theory.
2,Just the same ol' thing,"I heard this album by a friend and I didn't see difference about the 1st album. This is just the same thing... It's sounds like a certain scrapy pop rock (I can't believe we call it ROCK). The Chester voice is to horrible when he yell and the turntable n'machines don't have place in the band. I just want to say many bands deserve more attention than this generation of ""Gently Rock""..."
2,Linkin Pork's Meaty Aura,"Linkin Park is back with more quasi boy band metal. Seriously though, on one of the songs the singer sounds like he's doing a Nick Carter impersonation, i think its number 6. Anyway, I didn't expect this to be much better than the awful Hybrid Theory. It's virtually Hybrid Theory II, if not slightly more experimental. My problem with Linkin Park is that while the music is tolerable and sometimes they come up with some good hooks, the vocals and the lyrics are horrendous. Chester Beningtons screaming sounds more like a poodle being strangled and the rapping is just plain cheesey. He doesn't vary his delivery at all, it's the same in every song just different words. The lyrics are also the same in every song. You could interchange the lyrics between any two Linkin Park songs and barely tell the difference. If you're not into real music and just want to be kewl and hip like everyone else, then Meteora is waiting for you down at the mall."
1,...,"I thought Hybrid Theory was a piece of junk. This one is worse, if that is even possible. What a waste of a perfectly good CD. I'd rate it a negative number if I could. Go find some real music, and throw this piece of junk out into a blazing inferno."
2,"They're Very Talented, But That's All","Linkin Park is a very angry band and, even though they don't swear in any of their songs, they're not a very good example to the younger generation who listens to them. I'm in that younger generation, 14 years old to be exact. About a year ago I was totally taken with them and not realizing that their songs were changing me into a rebellious teen. I finally got over that whole Linkin craze and saw that, as much as I liked their songs, I had to stop listening to them. Even though I'm a Christian I can't help but fall down sometimes, and so I'm giving you some advice: don't go the way I did, just steer away from the bad stuff. Like it says in my title, the guys in Linkin Park are talented, but that's all."
5,the best rock cd out today,"okay so maybe you dont agree.thats fine because you dont have to...i love this cd it is my fav cd out right now.i like this better than their last effort,buy it and you will not be sorry.chester is the best singer in rock today and the band never shows off they just stay together.in my mind this is the best rock band ever.my fav songs are...2.dont stay...i love the sound of this song5.nice and heavy,just the way i like it.6.great vocals,smooth sound.10.my fav.forget the losers who say that this cd sucks...buy it today."
5,SHIBBY!!!,"in my opinion, this cd is a big improvment fron their last album""hybrid theory"". They have grown alot musicly as well as vocaly. Brads guitars are alot heavier and chesters vocals are more melodic. i bought this cd the day it came out, and have not stopped listening to it since then. another thing that makes this record more unique is how mike and joe use their skills as dj's to enhance the sound of the songs. therefore, this cd apeals to everyone no matter what your taste, songs like ""nobody's listening"" and ""session"" have more of a hop-hop/rap vibe. however, songs like ""dont stay"" and ""somewhere i belong"" apeal more to the hard rock/heavy metal fan of music. i recomend anyone to buy this record who is not afraid to hear something new and unique. Stand Strong"
4,1st Review of Meteora,"Alright I got the album today. Listened to it. I must say it's pretty different than their old style. At first it sounds almost like they've calmed down but the album builds up all the way through. All the songs are good, but they don't have that same old Linkin Park feel that you got from Hybrid Theory. Right around song 7 (Faint) is where the CD starts getting really good in my opinion. Before that the songs are a bit more mellow."
4,Hybrid Theory pt. 2,"After the success of Hybrid Theory in 2001, you would think Linkin Park would stick with the same forumla that made that album such a success, and they did. As a whole, this album is on par with Hybrid Theory, the main difference is, Hybrid Theory was a album of ""singles"", where every song could be released as a single piece of work. Meteora's songs play better as a collective, from beginning to end it's a solid performance. If you liked Hybrid Theory, you'll like Meteora, if not, this wont change your opinion of Linkin Park.Stand-out tracks are ""Somewhere I Belong"", ""Easier to Run"", and ""Breaking the Habit""."
2,Another Reviewer Dissing Linkin Park,"I hate to jump on the bandwagon but I can't help myself. Linkin Park is simply not a very good band. I heard this album when my friend who swears up and down by these guys asked me to give it a listen. Never one to be closed minded, I thought what the heck, it can't be that bad. Well I was wrong, it was horrible. Every song sounds the same and though I haven't listened to Hybrid Theory, it sounds like all the singles i've heard on the radio.They basically have three elements, whining vocals over a monotone rap, the same distortion filled guitar riffs they have always had and buried scratching to fill spaces. Lyrically it's the same pre-packaged rage every other nu-metal band has been spouting out for 5 years.... Two stars for being 38 minutes, at least they aren't pretentious enough to make a 75 minute album."
3,[the price] for this?,"As much as I've been defending the LP boys to my rock-purist friends, Meteora gave me little to work with. Like barely half an hour. I'm sorry, guys, I'd much rather you double the length of the music on the CD so I don't have to change it twice while I'm driving to get groceries...I'll take it over a neato DVD bonus any day. If you liked Hybrid Theory (which I did) then you will like Meteora. I'm just disappointed that I only LIKED it after giving these guys so much time since their first album (Reanimation notwithstanding) to come up with something original and better. Overall, this album IS good, and worthy of checking out, ..., you see that it's practically the other half of what most other bands would consider a full length album. I've paid [less] for EPs just as long as this."
2,"Oh, please.","Wow. This was disappointing. I first bought Hybrid Theory two years ago, and loved it. It was just the right balance of scratch, rhymes, and heavy riffs. Meteora does this, but too much. So many people say ""It's the heaviest thing I've ever heard!"". Oh, please. It's all about the lyrics they say. Well, when the music blatantly [stinks] you can't stand to hear the words. Shinoda does his rapping thing with Chester wailing like a monkey in the background. He has two modes: scream, and sing softly. The bass and guitar riffs are plodding and the scratches are annoying. Buy Tool or System of a Down with your money, rather than waste it on 37 minutes of screaming, scratching, and bad riffs. Unless you like that kind of thing."
3,waiting for next LP album...,"Im a big LP fan...i loved..loved loved hybrid theory. I didn't like Reanimation cuz i thought it was a rip-off. Same songs remixed? way to get more money! no way. But my excitement grew with meteora. When i heard the first song, i was happy cuz i thought it was well worth the wait...then it was downhill from there...the only songs i liked are the first and last songs. Truly a disappointment for a big BIG LP fan.I'm just gonna wait for the next LP album...wait for them to bring out all the SCREAMING and LOUD ELECTRIC GUITARS and the energy it had on the first album.i'll just wait...just hope i dont get disappointed again."
4,Listen for yourself.,"I liked this album. But so many people put on that they love the album or that they totally hate it; but you will never know until you listen to all the songs yourself. Before you judge Linkin Park, listen to the album and hear all the songs for yourself. Everyone is different, and their like for music is different too. Linkin Park is a different band.... they don't have the hardcore attitude Rap and Metal usually has. They are their own genre. Wether you hate or love the album, Linkin Park has become well-known and has made music that made you listen."
5,FAINT IS THE BEST SONG!!!,"This song is wicked cool perfect for head bangers. In the beging of the song it's wicked the way they use the violin. This is one of my favorite songs, also numb and breaking a habit are wicked to."
3,Disappointed!,"I sat through and listened to the entire album all the while wondering what happened to this band. Their first album, Hybrid Theory, completely blew my mind! When Reanimation came out, I was still very excited because most of the tracks were excellent. But then I pop in Meteora and got a different vibe from it. It's slower and less heavy. You hear Chester doing a lot more singing and less screaming. The whole mood of the album just seems mellow to me. If you are a Linkin Park fan, get the album just to be loyal. But if you're a new fan who just started listening to them, stick with Hybrid Theory and/or Reanimation."
4,seriously its really good,"This album DID show progression from Hybrid Theory. The production, sampling, and beats sound better and more original than Hybrid Theory. When I listen to the album I cant do it just once. I play it about two or three times through. Every song is great, only wish we could have gotten a little more music (36min is it) from these guys. If you liked them before you will like them even more."
4,A very good piece of work,"Meteora does continue along the same lines of Hybrid Theory, but if you like Linkin Park, then you should have no reason to dislike this album.As for those who complain about the turntables, I think they need to go listen to something else, because the turntables are an intrinsic part of the band, something that you can't do away with. I don't know how they can say that they liked the first one, but not the second one, because of the turntables."
2,Is it worht the money?,"now i admit, i am not the biggest likin park fan ever. I thought there last cd, hybrid theory, set a new page in music, combining rap, rock, electronica, and other elements to get a very new sound out. However this cd is normally supposed to be a maturation of the band, but yet, this is falling short of the goal. it will please the ears once, maybe twice, but the cd will lose it's flavor, like old gum, and it lose flavor quite rapidly. the cd has it's bright spots, but they are dim compared to the bar that was set by the last cd."
2,Deja Vu again!,"I loved ""Hybrid Theory"" and was really looking forward to Linkin Park's new release, but this one's a big let down! Now, even Evanessence does ""Linkin Park"" better than Linkin Park. How sad...Unfortunately the CD is just a big yawn. I guess I'll have to wait for the next Audioslave CD to be this disappointed again. Save your money on this stinker!"
3,Satisfactory,"i guess linkin park had lost the essence of their real music. the songs here are less good but also presentable. i just wanted to say to the linkn park that ""please make a more good album next time, a better or more better one."" keep rockin'"
3,ok,"Not bad, but not nearly as good as Hybrid Theory. While a tall order to follow up, Linkin seemingly cant make up their mind on what kind of music they want to make on this album; harder rock, rap, or turntable beats (see track 12). Check it out, but dont hold too high of hopes."
4,new Linkin Park!!!,"today, march 25th, was the (long awaited) release date of LP new record. Overall, it's a very good record, but I have not listened to it enough to be able to give it 5 stars. It contains 12 (well, 13, but the first one is only 13 seconds long) solid tracks. Standout tracks are the first single, Somewhere I belong, song 9 (breaking the habit), song 11 (Nobody's listening (strange music (with japanese flute, what's that anyway??) but same great vocals)) and song 13 (Numb). Song 12 is instrumental, good, but feels strangely dance-y.Finally I'd say that it lives up to the expectations but the first cd is still the best one (but maybe Meteora'll grow on me)."
1,Not good,Did LP try not to put effort into this CD? Because it sounds terrible yo. Except for somewhere I belong this CD lacks in a hit song. I think you would be happier in getting a Limp Bizkit CD.
1,Its real simple...P.O.S.,"This cd, Is a HUGE and I DO MEAN HUGE.. Dissapointment.. Linkin Park is DONE after this one. Hybrid theory was Good.. this one, is [bad], and if this is what they call an album. Then they are toast. First off, the songs sound like they were thrown together like a garage band with no talent thinking there gonna be the next big thing. SORRY LINKIN, YOU GUYS [aren't good]. THIS ALBUM [is bad]..AND I HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR 5 MINUTES OF FAME, CAUSE YOUR YESTERDAYS NEWS..."
4,Meteora,"Linkin Park is one of those bands that don't follow the trail that other ""rappers"" like Limp Bizkit and Korn. they write their own lyrics, co-produce their cds, and are more original than anything else out there. I must say, I would rather listen to Incubus, but hey, what's good is good. Oh, another thing, y r all the people that give the 1-star reviews say that it is bad nu-metal. Guess what!? it isn't supposed to be ""nu metal."" It is nore or less rap/rock/electronica. The nice touches by Mike Shinoda and Mr. Hahn are the best by almost any other band out there. So quit trying to come up with unjustifyed complaints, and listen to your old rock (i do have alot of respect for classic rock mind u). Bye it, u probably won't regret it, unless u have been brain washed by the people that hate this cd."
1,This album is causing death across the nation.,"**BREAKING NEWS** The album ""Meteora"" by Linkin Park is causing goths to kill themselves. Seriously though, do kids see the t-shirt and Hot Topic and rush out to buy the album then goto Amazon and give it a rave review before then even listen to it?Anyway onward to the actual album, This album is so horrible just a bunch of angry songs for kids who didn't make the team in high school, which is fine it helps them ""vent"" (not that making the football team is a big deal but oh well you can't get laid if you don't). But they take it too far and kill themselves during their friendly listen to Linkin Park because they saw a Hot Topic shirt that reccommended it. This album is horrible avoid it at all costs."
2,"pop? no, thanks",lp is now a lame band...no more songs like crawling or with you...i used to listen hybrid theory but meteora sucks hardill nino is much better
2,I LIKE,"I like the one song they have that has lyrics about not fitting in, slow verses, and a chorus with lifeless guitar riffs, mediocre drumming, barely any bass, and the lead singer screaming. Oh wait, thats every song... oops."
1,BUY THIS IF YOU LIKE ROCK MUSIC ONLY BECAUSE IT IS LOUD,"If you enjoy listening to generic music with absolutely no originallity than this album is perfect for you. If you dont even consider the lyrics, which are horrible, almost every song on this album sounds exactly alike. This is definitely not an album you can listen to many times, because it feels like you are only listening to one song. They have made every song that could possibly be good into a single, and the rest is just loud guitars. The lyrics are even worse, because all they sing about is pain and sufferening for no reason at all. If you enjoy music that is processed into one format for the masses to buy, than you might like this music. If you like originallity or quality than stay away from this album. I recommend they yeah yeah yeahs, the distillers, or the white stripes instead."
2,Linkin Park betrayed me!,"I think it is rather safe to say that LP has officially gone to pot. Most of the songs on this album sound the same. How heavy metal is that? I mean, there are no guitar solos, mostly synthetic drumming, and rap! Trust me, rap and rock do not mix.About a year ago I borrowed Hybrid Theory from a friend with very low expectations. However, I was completely blown away! It was excellent. This is just sad. Do yourself a favor and listen to Hybrid Theory instead. Or listen to some other good bands (e.g. Foo Fighters, Green Day, Fountains of Wayne, Trapt, or Yellowcard). Steer away from this poor excuse for an album. I will give it this though, Don't Stay, Faint, Breaking the Habit, and Numb are all pretty good songs. The rest are just pathetic."
4,LiNkIn PaRk rocks,"Linkin Park is awesome, I just went to the ATL Meteora concert and it was great! The music keeps you pumped and its not all about who screams the loudest on a mic, great music and vocals!"
1,Yawn....Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..... (sleeping),"Despite the constant screams and attempts to be loud, I found myself falling asleep listening to this last year. Enough said."
1,Meteora by Linkin Park,"Meteora is the death of music. Plain and simple.Let me begin by stating that this is not music. This is screaming. How they pushed 5 singles out of this album is beyond me.Forward, the most pointless waste of 13 seconds, kicks off this CD. Sadly, the sound of thumping and glass breaking represents basically the rest of the CD.Don't Stay comes next. Not a very impressive first song.If we jump to Breaking The Habit, this is the lamest attempt at an emotional song EVER!!! Chester F!ckington or whatever his name is still screams, even though this song is intended to be slow and mellow.The song Numb is a drastic last impression. It made it to the top 5 on 2 charts:1. The Top 40 charts2. My chart of Horrid songs that should have been thrown out as soon as they were finished recording them.An overview of the album:it is sucky, screaming, and repetitave.Please save your money and invest it elsewhere."
1,Wherefore art thou music,"I tried, I realy tried people.Everybody is always telling me how great LinKin Park is, and how i have to run out and buy the CD. But i just cant listen to these no talent hacks anymore. Everybody acts like these guys invented rap-rock. Hello, have you ever heard of real bands like Faith No More and the Chile Peppers who where doing this long before these guys knew how to walk. Please people if we keep supporting this crap Record companys will keep putting it out. Do all of us a favor save your 20 bucks. DONT ENCOURAGE THEM"
1,linkin park is so good!,THEY WERE LOSERS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY ARE STILL WHINING ABOUT IT! BUY THIS ALBUM!33
1,give this band some credit...,yea ill give this band some credit. i credit them and 20 million other generic bands for all sounding the same. i have listened to both cds and they are pointless and shallow. DO NOT BUY THIS CD or any other rap/nu-metal cds unless its Faith No More or Papa Roach. and whats the hold up it takes them 3 years to write about being angry? they virtualy used the same lyrics as hybrid theroy.. listen to FNM Papa Roach Rage Against The Machine Misfits Marilyn Manson or Nine INch Nails
1,erhhh...,"linkin park is, like, pretty lame. the music is pretty typical, you know, like other rock bands on the radio. listen to bands like white stripes, the strokes, the flaming lips, wilco, beatles, beck, or sonic youth might just be what you need. pass on the 12 year old boy band. that's all."
1,This CD Is An Infectious Disease,"Linkin Park were never good, and I regret liking the band 3 years ago. I bought ""Hybrid Theory"" and couldn't stop listening to it. This was when I was 13 years old. One and a half years later, my mom bought me ""Meteora"" and ""Rage Against The Machine"". I have regrets buying this piece of crap now. They have become one of the biggest mainstream ""rock"" bands out there, and their talent is wasted. One and a half years later, I burnt a copy to put in ""safe keeping"" in case I wanted to give it to one of my kids (I may not have kids...I'm an idiot). I sold this CD and got $6.25 out of it! Guess mainstream rock really is worth a lot!If you buy this album, only buy it as a drink coaster or a blank to use for shooting practice."
5,No Hybrid Theory but Still Very Impressive,"Like most all big Linkin Park fans, i was very anxious to hear meteora and hear what LP had to bring. This cd was not as good as hybrid theory, but hybrid theory is one of my favorite cd's ever. Meteora is still an excellent cd, and after a couple listens it grows on you, and you don't want to stop listening. They have quite a good blend of rock songs, and rap songs. There are some songs that are a little different sounding for them but it's good to see their range as musicians.Chester is still one of my favorite vocalists, along with david draiman of disturbed, and makes songs from being good to great. Some of my favorite tracks are, Lying From You, Hit The Floor, Faint, Figure.09, Dont Stay, and Nobody's Listening. Overall another great effort from these 6 guys. definitely pick up the cd."
3,|3.3| Casual listeners and teeny boppers apply.,"Meteora is not on par with Hybrid Theory. This is mainly due to the fact that Meteora is a tornado of high production. This means plastic music... but then again, teeny boppers won't care. As for casual listeners, this album will still provide 30 minutes of solid entertainment; just make sure you don't take any of this stuff seriously, unless your in the 5th grade. I would say that Linkin Park needs to grow up, but what does it matter? If they can keep pumpimg out fairly entertaining albums, then I could care less about the pre-school lyrics. Teeny boppers, this disc is for you. Casual listeners, get on Kazaa. Thumbs up."
3,rockin out!,"man this rocks you dont know rock like these guys. not as good as their other great albums or even the newish dixie chicks(fave on my turntable, permanent fixture) You don't have taste if you don't like the best most original blend of rap/metal with an edge blended especially for the smarter kids who can understand the brilliant mathematical genius of 5/4/ time and its tailor made for radio sound not unlike other rap metal blends of say, oh, 20,000 other rap metal bands. All good ones of course. I like EMO too!!!!!"
3,A pretty good CD,"Don't Stay - 7/10Somewhere I Belong 9/10Song #5 6/10Hit the Floor 8/10Easier to Run 8/10Faint 9/10Figure .08 7/10Breaking the Habit 10/10Song #10 alrightSong #11 with Japanese flute and Mike Shinoda and Chester rap 10/10Song #12 seems like a drum solo not as good as Cure for the Itch 6/10Numb 8/10 of course, it resembles Pushing me away. both in style and ratability"
3,Nothing New Here,"I'll admit it. When Hybrid Theory came out, I got it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was different at the time, and still remains a decent album. The problem is that Linkin Park knew this, and didn't really go anywhere else. This is really more of a Hybrid Theory Part 2 than a new album. The sound has changed very slightly, mostly just sounding more produced.Not a very bad CD, in fact, it's a fun listen. Short, but fun. Nothing spectacular, nothing amazing, not even close to innovative or groundbreaking.In short, while many people will enjoy this CD, it's not worth all the hype it got. With all the attention and tension leading up to it's release, you would think it would blow their previous efforts out of the water. Instead, they choose to do more of the same, and they will undoubtedly stagnate. If you want something truly groundbreaking, go listen to the Blood Brothers."
5,Awesome!,"I think that Meteora is an awesome cd, even better than LPs first, Hybrid Theory. These are the songs, from best to worst:1. Faint2. Numb3. Lying From You4. From the Inside5. Figure .096. Somewhere I Belong7. Don't Stay8. Hit the Floor9. Nobody's Listening10. Breaking the Habit11. Easier to Run12. Session13. ForewardIn ""Faint"" the beginning is cool with the violin, and I really like the beat. Overall this CD is really cool and I think you should buy it."
1,- 10 star,"crap musicall songs are same pattern, rap verse and screaming at the choruswht d'ya expect? nothing"
4,a change from hybrid theory,"when linkin park made hybrid theory they were still underground. then when they got big off that cd and made this, they made all the songs more radio friendly, chester doesnt scream like or as much and the songs are just not as angry as they were. there are still some really good songs but i cant go through the whole thing without skipping a single one like i could with HT. so if your really into linkin park like i was when i got this, you need to pick it up, but if you just like them for HT, you might want to leave this one alone."
1,hmmmm,"well i think id rather buy a rap cd.....wait nvm, they rap in thier music anyways!! yes!!! thats like, a double-crap all packaged up and ready for me to waste 13 bucks on...totally awesome"
2,This is the incredible follow-up?,"I loved Hybrid Theory. LOVED IT. But Meteora, though it was said to be just as good, well ... doesn't come close. The first single, ""Somewhere I Belong,"" is pretty good, but it still took me a few listens to like it. I think there are no other songs worth mentioning on this album except the incredible second single, ""Faint."" I didn't think much of that either, though, the first couple of times I heard it, but now I love it. Buy ""Faint"" as a single, for sure ... but not this album."
1,Linkin Park and Nu Metal Still Suck,"Linkin Park and this whole entire nu metal genre (except godsmack and tool) is the worst genre and band everin the history of rock music, I Have blame nirvana for this american downfall and I Wanna thank kurt nobrainyou have given this stupid band any credit for influence this crap of filth we have to put up with today.this cd sucks and should be thrown right in the trashwhere it belongsLinkin Park is so awful it makes jon bon jovi looklike like saddam hussein.Big Thumbs Down for me."
2,"2-1/2 stars -- This IS Linkin Park, right?","Just so you know, this isn't just another review from a Linkin Park hater who never listened to the album. I love Linkin Park, but this album ain't that hot.I have to say that making ""Somewhere I Belong"" the leadoff single was a good idea, because it's the best song on the album. ""Nobody's Listening"" is pretty good too (except for the dry chorus), and ""Breaking The Habit"" is decent, but the rest of the album seriously falls short of what LP are capable of. For instance, Hybrid Theory showcased Chester's screaming blending in well with the songs, but here he's either yelling without really saying anything, or the screaming drowns out the music (Craig Nicholls of The Vines shares the latter problem). And Mike's rhymes are decent, but after a while they start to sound the same.I got the limited edition of this with the bonus DVD, but I didn't even watch it because I was so disappointed with the album."
1,tatoly dezaponted,"I fought this cdd was goinna roack simplee becauz this band is got the ferst word spelled wrong... its lookes koolr lake thet do not't get me wroung... Linkin lakes so much better than Lincoln... the ""L"" doesnt even make noise... I meen come oun... thats just stopid... Lincoln is dumb... but anyway I think the L should be taken out... but Linkin Park was a godly bend until Chester turned into the bad side of musik hestoree.... thank about it... he just isnt that grey... he looks more green to me."
5,LPRoxNotU,"Hey all customers! Linkin Park Rocks. They kno my sn too. I love you and just to tell u, all of their cds r awesome. I luv numb, faint etc. Right now I'm listening to Somewhere I belong. I'm practicing Mike's part. I love linkin park and they inspire me. And their cds have such a kewl cover. Buy their cd and enjoy the fun with me!"
1,Why this album and band deserves no respect,"First of all, I heard Hybrid theory and it was tolerable at first but then it became mundane and just terrible. I hate kids that call this stuff ""metal"" or ""rap"". Its just crap if you ask me. If anyone needs a definition of metal I would recommend bands like Metallica (The greatest band of all time), Slayer, Pantera, Megadeth, Iced Earth, Dream Theater, and anything else besides this ""nu-metal"" stuff. Linkin Park is the biggest sellout band of all time. For Meteora how many videos did they release? See my point. They have no talent. Their guitar riffs cannot be distinguished from the bass and all the other crap. This is not talent at all. Oh well this is just my oppinion."
1,Get old really fast! I mean really fast!,"Linkin park was never my favorite band and will never been. There cd ""Meteora"" kick off very nice with glass shattering at the end after the 14 sec kickoff. Then ""breaking the habit"" start and it sound really nice. honestly i love this cd when i burrow it from my friend and copy it for myself. But in about two day, i was quickly tire of this cd. I would review it track by track but this album doesn't deserve my review. Do yourselve all a favor and don't buy this album! Period!"
2,Linkin Park sucks,This sucks all they do is yell in to the mike. heck a monkey could play as good Guitar as these guys.If you want some good music go to Green Day the best punk band I the world. or Sum 41 they kind of have the same sound but you can understand them. Like my moms says to whiches own But If you good buy beat it's ok. later :>)
1,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,i wasted 16$ on this cd do not make the same mistake don't even waste your time downloading it
1,It makes me mad people listen to this,"These Nu-metal bands with there rappers/screamers, dj mixers and such I can't stand. Don't you people realize this is tearing apart rock n'roll, I mean please any rock band that comes out with a remix album is a disgrace. Linkin Park is part of the rap-metal evolution, posslibly the worst in music history. All these bands of this cadagory are fading away thank god, for example. Papa Roach,korn,Nickleback,Limp Bizkit,and P.O.D's last albums all flopped. Linkin Park is the only band hanging in there, but not for long. Luckily bands are coming out bringing back the sound of the old roots of rock n'roll. If your a Linkin Park fan and your saying that there oh so talented, then you don't know what your talking about, either you dont play an instrument or you do and your terrible because a two year old could play Linkin Parks guitar licks."
2,oh...my...gosh,"wow, my original review was way off from what i think now. at first, i was blown away by this. after about 10 listens at the most, though, it started to get old. fast. their lyrics are subpar when compared to their past works, under whatever name they happened to be going by at the time (Xero, Hybrid Theory, etc.). Gone are the open-ended songs, full of imagery and begging to be interpreted however you wanted to. Now, the lyrics are so straightforward and unoriginal on most songs, it's almost enough to make me sick. it's like LP teamed up with an emo band to write a lot of songs on here. i'll give it two stars because there are a few good tracks, namely Faint and Breaking the Habit, and the DVD was entertaining. but please, for your own sake, stay away from this. go buy Reanimation instead, or better yet, go and get Waking the Fallen by Avenged Sevenfold, which is easily the best album of 2003."
3,too few good tracks,Not as good as 'Hybrid Theory' but still deserves 3 stars. 'Lying From You' and 'Faint' are the songs that make the CD worth buying.
1,IM MAD BECAUSE YOU WONT DO THIS!,"IM MAD BECAUSE YOU WONT BE THIS WAYMAYBE I USED TO BE BETTER EVERY DAYIM REALLY NOT OKAYSTOP BEING THE WAY YOU ARE!!!!!!i just wrote linkin parks new hit number one single!! yay. add some power chords over and over, and your gonna sell a few million albums to some stupid 14 year olds.O, ya, and for the review.... HORRIBLE"
5,maybe better then hybrid theory,Ok first off if your into heavy metal of course you will give this one or two stars for everyone else it will be around a four or five.They actually have unique lyrics that also go good toghether and make u feel like your in their situation.Like 5 of the songs are popular music videos and its listed as the 134th best selling item in music.Most of the sounds each have their own uniqueness and basically they own.They arent trying to be the best band in the world just a good one and they have suceeded.I would say faint figure.09 breaking the habit are a few of the best songs on it.I recommend the live in texas cd dvd set.If you arent in hardcore metal like most arent then u will love this otherwise go for slayer or something.
3,"Catchy, but not great rock","While Linkin Park may be a relatively successful nu rock band and is a tolerable lesser of many evils in post-metal music, this album certainly is not great. The songs eventually become a blur of the same constant raspy scream, lack of guitar and rhythm talent, and rap that no true rock fan wants to hear. I'm sick of people claiming that they are the greatest because there are current bands out there with more talent and with better songs but no one will ever beat the true rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Guns N Roses, AC/DC, Van Halen, etc."
4,Good album but disappointing...,"Everyone has their own opinions and to be honest I think Meteora was a great album...But not the best album. Meteora's key points are that some songs are great and the others are not. For example, Faint and Lying From You are very good songs but songs like Breaking The Habit and Easier to run are just about tolerable...it's an unfortunate turn out that Linkin Park couldn't release an album as good as Hybrid Theory, which I loved, but after watching ""the making of Meteora"" I realised that it wasn't the best time for Linkin Park to release their album, just finishing up the concerts stuff and all...But I still love the album and I don't regret buying it at all...It's just that it's kinda disappointing"
4,Worth the money,I have to admit I was never a big on the rap/metal mixture but this group definitely makes the combination sound natural. Every song is good but the down side to that is the cd only lasts a little more than a half an hour.
4,sure why not,"this album was great. not the best but great. if u put it up agenst something like x-acutioners it would be better but not their best. 4 example, hypred theory was better but this was better then reaninmation. but this is really worth buying. songs like nobodies listing and somewhere i belong really made the album. you'll be happy if u buy this one."
1,Meteora? No. Mediocre!,"Disappointed is an understatement. After listening to all 36 minutes of this CD I wondered what all the hype was about. I own and love ""Hybrid Theory"". The original CD was filled with awesome music and lyrics that actually mean something. Hard to find these days in rock music and made rock/rap sound good to all rock fans. ""Meteora"" is just plain boring to listen too. Slower then HT and much less creative. I could imagine the guys in LP sitting in the studio discussing how to arrange a track and end up saying ""Ahh, screw it. The fans will buy it anyway."" Why bother using your talent when you got the record companies hype machine to sell it for you? I'm giving ""Meteora"" a 1 star to offset the fanboys who will give this CD 5 stars becuase it ""r00lz"" or whatever."
1,Linkin PArk Sucks,This is the most god awful band i have ever heard. LINKIN PARK HAS THE DUMBEST MOST STUBBORN FANS . THE LYRICS SUCK AND THE MUSIC IS TALENTLESS IT IS THE WORST BAND EVER MAINSTREAM
1,Linkin Park blows...,"For those of you who haven't heard Linkin Park, they are a rock/rap group. I like rap and rock, but I hate hearing Linkin Park sing rock, because they can't sing or play guitar worth a crap. It's pathetic when they try to rap, because they also suck at that. I read a review by this retard who goes by ""g"". His review is titled something like ""Hataz need to stop hatin"". And then he claims that bands are Slayer are commerical. As opposed to Linkin Park? Linkin Park is one of the most commerical bands out there. Linkin Park should NOT mix rap with rock the way they do. They need to kill themselves. As for ""g"", u need 2 uz kurekt inglish yo. Seriously, quit being so damn ignorant. Go back to school, pass English, and quit listening to that Linkin Park and Avril Lavigne crap. Oh, what's that, ""g"", you're gonna bust a cap in my hatin' ass? You'll have to find me first."
2,"Far Too Long, But She Cured My Insomnia.","I agree with the other 1 & 2 star reviewers. This book had potential, but got lost in the authors endless sentences & Narcissism. This is basically padded common sense. It was at least 100 pages too long, & somewhat repetitive. This is a find-yourself before you can be happy with a mate type of self-help book. The only thing new & refreshing was that this author unlike many feminists did not spend much time bashing, or trying to fix men. Read Camille Paglia, Susan Faludi & Norah Vincents books if you want some insights that have more than the authors opinions to base their points on."
1,Encourages anorexic behavior,"In this book, Mrs. Brown suggests a 1000 calorie a day diet, crash dieting, fasting, exercising when you are sick and tells the reader that men who like a bigger women are looking for mothers.Two chapters of telling the reader anything over 110 pounds is pudgy and how to starve yourself into skinniness. Disgusting!"
2,Impossible to Read,"After seeing an entertaining Biography special on Helen Gurley Brown, I thought I'd track down one of her books. Unfortunately, Ms. Brown's overuse of italics and endless sentences make this book tiresome and impossible to read. She has basically sound advice, but finding her pearls of wisdom is like finding a needle in a haystack -- her nonstop jabbering over several hundred pages is a witless mess, rather than a useful guide for the modern woman."
1,What a fruitcake!,"What a weird little skeletal-like woman. Starving herself, giving up sugar (though she admits going back on in later books), working constantly, never having kids and dismissing them as tiresome, expensive burdens to one's career, bragging incessantly about dinner at the ""Cap De Ville"" (some tres elegant locale) while in Granada (some tres elegant locale), enthusiastically endorsing sleeping with married men while stating she'd die if hubby did, geez!"
4,nice present for a pregnant daughtef,"bought it for my pregnant daughter whose husband is an ojibwe canadian. not sure if she read it yet, but i did and i enjoyed it. i had thought it was about the birth of ms. erdrich's youngest daughter , but actually it was a much older book talking about her older 3 daughters' births. sadly her late husband michael dorris is mentioned and his suicide is in the future."
1,Blue Jay's Dance,"After several e-mail conversations regarding the shipment of this product I still never received the book. Distributor claimed a second book was shipped and no longer responded to my e-mails requesting additional information for tracking with the shipping services. The first correspondence implied that the book would be sent, I really wish it had been."
5,This is an amazing book!,"I loved this book when I first read it before my daughter was born. Re-reading it now, as a new mother, I find it even more remarkable. Louise Erdrich has perfectly captured both the frustration and surpassing joy of life with a new baby. The book is also a beautiful nature narrative, with observations on the changing of the seasons interwoven with the story of a child's first year. Highly recommended!"
4,The dance of birth,I have loved each if Louise Erdrich's books that I have read. Her warmth and heart come through perfectly in this journal of birth. She has been blessed by the same goddess who has nurtured every woman during her birthing times from time immemorial. Highly recommended to all women who love life. And all men who love them.
5,"Louise Erdrich's writing is amazing, a 'must read'.","I couldn't put his book down, not so much for it's contents as for Louise Erdrich's poetic prose. She has great insight and the overall impression is of dream-like flow. I can't wait to order her book of poems"
5,JOHN HAS OUTDONE HIMSELF,"THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT DISCRIBES JOHN AND NEW LIFE. THEY HAVE BEEN A BLESSING OVER THE YEARS WITH THERE RECORDINGS AND THIS IS NO DIFFRENT. THERE IS EVERYTHING IN THE CD FROM TRADITION, CONTEMPORY, HIP HOP,PRAIS AND WORSHIP AND JOHN'S OWN TWIST TO IT."
4,Good album,"Overall, a good album! I'm not too keen on some of the hip hop cuts...i.e. Eastside/Westside.. but I really love his simpler, but uplifting jams ""Another Love"", ""Mighty God"" ""He made a way"" and the title track. I'd recommend this CD."
4,Just like I remember,These bdu pants fit and feel just like the ones I had to wear when I was in the Army.
3,mookie,These pants were of good quality except that the size adjustment tabs on the sides will not hold and a belt must be used.
3,Good Enough for a Young Girl's Room,"The sheets are soft and wash well. The comforter is a bit scratchy, the skirts a bit shorter than I'd like, and the edges of the shams are flimsy.Overall, it was a worthwhile purchase. It looks very cute in my five year old daughter's room, and the bed-in-a-bag price will make it less painful when she grows out of her lavender cheetah phase."
4,Gangs of New Orleans,"While written in 1936, many of the names are familiar ones today in New Orleans and Louisiana history.One of the great things about this book is each of the 14 chapters stands alone - if you want to just read about criminals, or voodoo, or the early history - you can do so. The book has many laugh out loud moments, which help balance some of the more serious episodes in the book - such as the lynching of the Italians.I have the paperback edition published in 2003 by Knopf. While the illustrations are not as clear as some hardbacks, they still show the detail needed to support the stories.Denver Mullican"
2,This book needs revision,"This book was written so long ago, but has been re-released with a new cover. It contains racist terms and old fashioned dialog. I wished I had been more aware and had bought a more updated history of New Orleans."
3,A daring book of its day,"Herbert Asbury must have been the daring writer of his day, daring to approach topics such as the red light district of New Orleans and the flesh trade in books that have retained a cult following to this day. In somewhat florrid prose, he manages to present a fairly accurate history of the French Quarter, its denizens, and chatacters, includong voodoo queens and madams and the social climates that shaped it. It portrays the politics and characters, the scoundrals and the thiefs. The book is as much a part of the era in which it was written, although New Orleans is a bit removed from the social climes of the rest of the country. It is a facinating portrait of a n era and a place that is a delight to visit for a time."
2,Engaging but just barely,"This is a minimally engaging book -- just interesting enough to keep you going, but never so interesting that it counts as engrossing. The premise is weak -- the main character is a kind of telephone surfer -- and the characters are superficial and silly. And though the author warns you at the beginning that none of the facts are to be taken as true, that they're connected to historical figures like Edison and Bell means that years from now much of what I think I know about these people will actually have been fabricated."
4,Uli Roth is still around,"They asked for a rating and I gave it, but the real purpose of this message is to say Uli Roth is still recording and touring with Sky of Avalon."
2,Beware,"The low rating does not refer to the quality of the songs in this album, which is, of course, a total Scorpions classic. The low rating is to thsi edition especifically. It is not remastered, the sound is crap, one of the worst transfers from LP to CD that I have witnessed. Just be warned."
5,buy this album its Ulis last scorp album,an excellent early scorpions release. Uli Roths final album with the crew.Another must have.
4,Scorpions - 'Virgin Killer' (BMG),"Originally released in 1976,as this was their fourth record.To all/any U.S. Scorpions fans that may not be aware of their early work,1979's 'Lovedrive' was actually their seventh effort.I've had a few fans ask me about that.Main reason I give this CD reissue a four-star rating was because it was good enough to hold my complete attention all the way through.Although most(if not any)of these tracks are not recognizable by most American fans,but I thought they still sounded like good,well produced 'heavy arena rock'.Best tunes are ""Pictured Life"",the rocking ""Backstage Queen"",title track ""Virgin Killer"" and ""Polar Nights"".Plus guitarist Michael Schenker returned for a spell for this lp.Give it a try."
4,Virgen Killer (SCORPIONS),"Virgen Killer was a pretty good album for the year that came out and during that era the sound was raw and original this album has been part of my collection for many years,I do wanna point out that there's a missinformation from the EDITORIAL REVIEWS Michael Schenker had nothing to do with this album,the album you're refering to is LOVEDRIVE 1979 He played lead guitar on 3 songs after quiting UFO and went on to form his own band THE MICHAEL SCHENKER GROUP (MSG)!"
5,Scorpions in 1976......now you've heard everthing.,"I still find it kind of hard to believe that Scorpions were around in 1976,let alone having 3 previous albums.....I didn't hear of these guys until 1982........Lets paint a picture...Ok I just got done watching that new show Welcome Back Kotter,I think I'll listen to that new Scorpions album????!!!!......well anyway Virgin Killer is a preety darn good Scorps album,brilliant guitar work from Rudolph and Uli.......Klaus' voice sounds great....it earns 5 stars........""Backstage Queen"" and ""Pictured Life"" are my faves....I like ""Hell Cat"" and ""Polar Nights"" too,but Uli's voice is just plain bad.....I've heard better voices at karaoke bars...his voice is that bad and off-key.....but he makes up for it with the blistering guitar work and his voice actually is kind of amusing....thats why no deduction in stars."
5,Old School Scorps Always a good buy,Anything by the Scorps from 1983 and back is a good CD to have. Trust me and you won't regret it!Will they ever put out the US Festival 1983 performance on DVD? Take a cue from Judas Priest and get that bad boy out on DVD!
4,good information,"There is a good amount of information in this book, it is a little difficult to remember what one suggestion makes into the next one so I suggest notes."
3,Fertility for dummies,"This book was okay. Not great. You can learn a lot more just by searching on the internet. Since it was published in 2005 ( I think) it is a little out dated. Good resource to have nonetheless, just to look something up quickly."
2,More of the same....,"If you have read any other books on infertility, don't bother with this one. It truly is for dummies, in that there is really no helpful new approach or information. It is more of a reproductive dictionary."
3,Basics for Orchestral Groups,"This book is mostly geared toward orchestral groups, choirs and those reciting classical music pieces. The tips are good but briefly stated and then repeated in each section."
3,Another book on writing --nothing special,"This is, once more a book on writing and to tell you the truth, If you've read one, you've read them all. They all get into the same stuff, Point of view, resist the urge to explain, exposition, tell the story in the now, dialogue, and many many more. If you have told yourself you are going to write a book and you wanted to get a book on the craft, then by all means get this one. It is no different than, Self Editing for Fiction Writers, The First Five Pages, How to Write a Damn Good Novel or many others out there.SUGGESTION: Two books that helped me out, more than any other, On Writing by Stephen King and Elements of Style By Strunk and White. Read those as well as this book, and you should have enough tools in your belt to get the job done."
1,not worth the money,"I don't know what most of these other reviewers are talking about. This book doesn't contain anything I haven't seen explained better in other more helpful books. Probably a fifth of the book is taken up in direct excerpts from the books the author analyzes, and there are hardly any principles that don't apply to any well written book. This is just a gimmick to sell the book to writers who have lofty dreams of writing a bestseller. The premise is bad - you shouldn't write a book expecting it to be a blockbuster. Write a good book first, and through editing and promotion, you might realize your goal. I would recommend ""Structuring Your Novel"" by Robert Meredith and ""Building Better Plots"" by Robert Kernen."
2,too severe,"i think this is more for an editor. or any person who reviews a manuscript and helps the author improve it. if i had read this before completing my novel - i think i would have been discouraged to the point of giving up. it negates the creativity, excitement and fun of writing."
2,look elsewhere,"This book was a total disapointment. Beware of one thing! This book assumes that you have read the following books; The Godfather, Gone with the wind, The thorn birds, The man from St. Petersburg and garden of lies. If, indeed you have read these books, you might be able to benefit from the book, otherwise forget it. It keeps on relating to these books chapter after chapter, so, in my case it was useless. There are so many better writing aid books out there. Skip this one."
3,Ok - but not quite.....,The tree is a great value for the $. It's as tall as it claims to be but it's not really usable at that height. It's quite wobbly when extended that far. Although I did put it up and my kitties are using it. (I just wrapped a furniture strap around one of the posts and bolted it to a stud it the wall and now it's sturdy as can be!)
4,Saturdays watching Superhost!,"Ok...I can remember this movie back from when I was 13 years old watching Superhost. This movie was a ""staple"" in their movie list and they showed it often. I can still remember everything about this movie and I haven't seen it for 21 years- that is how frightening it was. This is your typical old style film where the ending drive-in scene was s l o w l y built up for a scary classic horror scene to remember! I'll never get Andy's face out of my mind when he comes up from the back seat.....ugh! I loved this movie."
2,Was Dissappionted With This Film,"Perhap this film was well made and all, but it was somewhat disappionting for me! The war veterans father was so irritating at times and it was a little too bloody for me!Some of the films aspects I did like! The war veteran seemed very creepy(imagine a 20 something year old man who spend most of the day sitting in a rocking chair)! Very creepy! However, I was disappionted the overall film was otherwise not really all that creepy as I hope to see in a low budget early 70's film and I didn't like the frequint us of Gods name used in vain (esp. by that old goat father)! I don't think I'll watch it again!If you Liked ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" well several cast members of that film (esp. Anya) also appeared on here!"
4,This one will chill you!,"This is a very low budget 1972 horror flick concerning the return of a Vietnam vet to small town America after his parents had been notified he was dead. He acts very strange, won't eat or sleep, but has a strange craving... Bob Clark, who would become a huge cult icon with Black Christmas, Christmas Story, Porky's and Murder by Decree, cut his teeth on this low budgeter. His talent shines through. He was lucky enough to get a young Tom Savini to do the bloody effects. Richard Backus plays the young soldier. He is quite restrained and very creepy!This is one of the first anti-Vietnam War films.You've probably only seen it on late night TV. Now, Blue Underground releases the film in all it's glory: included are two commentaries (writer and director), an interview with Backus and a short about Savini. This is a must for early 70's horror freaks, and all others are invited to be creeped out!!"
1,Just Another Zombie Flick,"This is nothing more than a zombie undead movie trying to pass itself off as a commentary on the Vietnam war. I'm surprised at all the shallow-minded reviewers giving this movie raves & a high rating. The problems facing those who were involved as veterans in the Vietnam war (or any war) deserve better, more thoughtful treatment than this nonsense."
4,Not a good book for the multithreading novice.,"This is the first O'Reilly book I've ever read that I cannot wholeheartedly recommend.The introduction to the book states the it is aimed at the novice. However, the examples in the book contain several novice mistakes. The book also glosses over a few point that an experienced MT programmer would understand, but would be baffling to a novice. I also found a few Win32 mistakes such as their handling of redirection of standard in, out, and error.If you know MT and Win32, it's probably a good book. If you don't keep looking."
5,A Classic Textbook for college consumer-based courses.,"This texbook covers all the bases for any consumer oriented course at the college level. Its approach involves more economic analysis than the standard text, but its language and approach are very student friendly"
4,Calypso,Received the cd in excellent condition and on time. I attended severalBelafonte concerts at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles' Griffith Park. Enjoyed them all. I would still like to get a CD one of his many performances at The Greek Theater.
4,Some of my favorite music,"Harry Belafonte's treatment is what got me interested in Calypso music... he does it so well. A lot of fun songs on this album, especially Jamaica Farewell and ""Woman is Smarter."" I'm trying to learn how to play Jamaica Farewell on my uke and this is definitely helping."
5,When I hear these songs I want to sing and dance.,"My dad had a record with all these songs. I was so happy to find them on a single CD. Every one of these songs, sung by Harry Belafonte, is great. My sons (they're teenagers) like these songs too. The lyrics, music, and Harry Belafonte's voice makes us feel happy."
4,Great for the price,The car charger works as expected. The ear buds however aren't as loud as I would like them to be.
1,can not rate,I cannot rate this product because I ordered it and the seller e-mailed me and said that it was out of stock and he could not get the shirt again.
2,Interesting yet sluggish,"No,it's going great,every reason and surely seemingly having our last ending. Not my favorite book, but maybe you'd like it if you enjoy boring self-indulgence."
3,Got lost in Africa,"This one moved too slow for me, especially when we got to the extended family in Africa. The ending also seemed to be hurried. What was amazing to me is he wrote this while still a student in college, roughly 25 years old."
4,Good To Know,I had people asking me about our President and I knew absolutely nothing about the CEO of our Nation!! Very informative book about the dude in charge. He is a well-rounded individual. I think some of his past is a little gray but then again what president in the history of our fine country hasn't had a questionable background ? Very good read. I recommend this book to anyone old enough to VOTE!!
5,Great Book!,"I loved this book! I'm so glad he wrote it before attempting public office because it was an honest expression of his experiences and beliefs. I think many things would have been left out if he had considered possible future consequences. However, by leaving them in there were no skeletons in his closet. This book was interesting to me because it was the true story of a man with a very unusual life. Even if he had never been president it would have been a fascinating book!"
2,I am more convinced than ever,"That he is a Socialist narcissist. Yeah. I read it. Sad that you are buying this crap hook, line, and sink us all. A good read for educational purposes on that front."
1,Worse book ever,Completely stupid book that glorifies socialism in its worse form. I was shocked to see the lack of education on Obamas part. WOW.
1,Not impressed,"I can't say that I found this to be life changing. Self-serving would be more appropriate. For someone whom has a deep affiliation and so called understanding of Kenyans, I find it hard to believe that there was not and has not been a mention of aparteid. Watch The Rising Son if you need a reminder. Not only is there poverty and socialist ideals, there are grand scale MURDERS."
5,Dreams from my Father - Barack Obama,"This book, audio, read by new President Obama, points out his longing to be connected with his black background and the father he barely knew. He was raised as a white person, in a white person's family, however in a black body. His search for reconciliation and identification is touching. His trip to Africa to meet his father's family was very interesting and he shares deep feelings and thoughts with the reader. I would definitely recommend this book as well as the Audacity of Hope to anyone interested in knowing our new President from the inside, his plans, his thoughts, for himself and our country."
1,Could Not Get Into It ...,"I REALLY tried to get into this book, but I just could not. Finally I just gaveup trying to push my way through it. I felt like I was missing any key takeaways or lessons beyond understanding what impact his upbringing might have on the way he views the world."
2,"An autobiographical novel, of course....","This is a novel based on the author himself. Interesting, but deceptive, of course..Not a pure auto-biography. A display of conceit.."
1,Ugh,"This was recommended reading for a class I am currently enrolled in for Race, Gender, Class, and Sexuality. I found the book incredibly difficult to get through due to the writing style. It is written on a low and easily comprehensible level which I feel truly diminished the content. If the goal was to write an easy read it may have been accomplished; but to what advantage I am unsure. I found the grammatical composition (ex. run-on sentences)hard to follow. The read did not engage me on any meaningful level. I did happen to vote for the man."
1,Light skinned Negro without dialect wins presidency,The story of a light skinned Negro with a sometimes Negro dialect yearns to be president. It is well written with some inspiring moments.He did become our first colored president but I don't think this book is worth the time and effort and money but I can see that some disagreed by rating it five stars.
1,hopscotch makes more sense than this drivel,Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war. Read some shakespeare dude or better yet Mr O should read some economics
1,Narcicissm and Arrogance at its finest,"If anyone still has any doubts that this guy is so full of himself and drunk on power read this book. He totally forgets that he is half white and throws his Caucasian relatives under the bus. Many people think he is a cool, calm character, but I think he is like a deer in the headlights that doesn't know what to do. Makes me wonder how long he can keep his smoke and mirrors act going. His house of cards can't stand for much longer."
5,"Beautiful story, truly.","What a great book, thus far. I'm only on chapter 3 and I started reading last night but I can't wait to finish. The story is so beautifully constructed and his stories hit home for me personally."
4,"Extraordinary story, well told","We all know that Barack Obama has an incredible life story. The surprise here is that he's able to tell it so well. Whether he is talking about his unusual childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, his challenging community work in Chicago, or his first emotional visit to family in Kenya, Dreams from My Father never falls short of anything but absorbing. Obama is clearly a man who loves to wrestle with words and ideas. He's also straight-talking and honest. Occasionally he's funny. This has got to be among the most surprising and interesting memoirs by a politician I've ever read."
2,a nice salespitch of trials and dreams,"The Presidential office is not a place to hone your salespitch or fulfill your dreams. The American people need a leader with more than ""hope"" and more than dreams. I think his pretty words are well written in this book, but parsing the words and examining for content... not much new and not much meat."
5,Brilliant - a must for the modern age,"Forgetting for a moment who wrote this book; this is an engaging, thoughtful, intelligent, perceptive read. This is a real meditation on race and specifically, on what it means to grow up and search for one's racial identity in modern America. And yet, it is beautifully written. Rich in descriptive detail and almost novelistic vignettes, it is also pacey and hard to put down.Returning to the author, it is truly hard to believe that this was written by a politician (although he wasn't at the time of writing). It is such a good read and provides such a thoughtful and open account of Obama's views and experiences, that it is truly breathtaking in this age of political posturing.Read this to learn more about Obama. Read this to learn more about the divisions of America. Read this to learn about the black experience both in the US and in Kenya. Read this for the beauty of its writing, but above all, read it, you won't be disappointed."
5,Dream of a Book ....,"This well-written autobiography offers profound insights into the mind and heart of our new President. Written long before he ever contemplated the remarkable turn his life would take, it provides an honest look into the search for his own identity, and the way his unusual heritage influenced his personal, and world, view. AS citizens of the country he has now been elected to preside over during an unparalleled economic and cultural time of crisis, we would all benefit by reading this gifted man's personal story. The eloquence and emotion in his writing make this book an easy page turner."
5,At Last - an intellegent president,"A man that can put more than 3 words together. A fascinating story from the President of the United States before he was president. Precise, humorous, informative, etc. A great read."
2,Disappointing,"I found it disappointing that after reading Obama's words, that so many people were still able to convince themselves that this was a work of fiction and with a clear conscience still able to convince themselves to vote for this man as our president of the United States. Baffling. I do recommend that everyone read it."
2,Disappointing,I had high expectations for this book but found it very tedious and difficult to follow at times. It was more like reading a law review than an autobiography. Obama would do better to let someone else do the writing.
1,Poorly written,"This book is full of contradictions and inaccuracies. Many parts don't make sense. Much of it seems like the imagination of someone who has ""delusions of grandeur,"" thinking themself to be extraordinarily gifted beyond everyone else. In summary, this book is a load of ****."
2,Not what I expected...,"I was hoping for something more along the lines of a struggle of balance for people of mixed cultures, which is what the book is marketed to be. I was dissapointed in the how misleading the books advertising was after reading the content.However, like many reveiwers before me have said, Barack Obama is an amazing man, and senator. This is still a 'good' book nonetheless."
3,One of the better written memoirs lately.,Alot of memoirs to read lately including Jimmy Carter and others of that type are so hard to read through. They simply are not entertaining. Barack writes stories and statements that will provoke thought. Some of his conclusions are a little off tilt.
4,Captivating,"I admired Senator Obama, but I wanted to know more about him. Now I can only hope that someone with his integrity, values, intellect, honesty, modesty and motivation can lead this country in the future. I really feel like I know ""Barry"" and hope I am fortunate enough to hear Senator Obama speak in the near future. The book has so many story lines 1) Growing up inter-racial, 2) Learning about his African family 3) The influence of grandparents 3) Becoming focused as a young adult after a confusing childhood 4) the life of a community organizer and much more! I was only sorry it ended when it did!"
2,Just OK,"Agree with the other reviewers who wondered why a whole book devoted to a absentee father.His father is not a sympathetic character, he had multiple wives and children seemingly without thinking about how to take care of them."
2,Somewhat interesting but lacks the urge to keep reading,"I had to read this book for one of my school classes. I was interested in this book because I thought it would be interesting to read what this man has gone through. Yet when I started reading, there was nothing exciting or gripping to make me read on. Obama manages to write 4 pages on the morals behind a lady that wore colored contacts one day. It has nothing to do with the story and makes you lose attention. It gets interesting when Obama hears who his father really was. But immidiately after that, the interest is lost.I myself have not lived in America during the time of this book, and am not an African American. This book doesn't say much to me.Finally I think that he should have spend more time discussing his mother and the influences she had on his life.I wouldn't recommend this book if you do not like books that sometimes lose track of the main plot."
3,More style than substance,"I was impressed by Barack's incredible personal history and early life expereinces. He is also a strong narrator for the audio tapes. In the end, however, I felt like I was missing any key takeaways or lessons beyond understanding what impact his upbringing might have on the way he views the world."
1,Not so good.,"It's too bad that he has admitted to having ""composites"" in this book. For those of you who don't understand what that is, it means some of it never happened. One of them is when he talks about his mom being called stanley steamer when she was a kid. Stanley Steamer didn't become that until the 1970's. His mom was a kid in like the fifties."
4,Well Spoken Audio Book,"Obama lends his voice to take us along on a journey through his life. There's a reason why this won a Grammy for spoken word, as Obama embodies the characters in his book with the skill of an actor. My only qualm would be that the Audio Book is abridged and is not the entire ""Dreams of My Father"" book, so it would be good to supplement the CD with the book if you want the whole story."
2,All About Him,"And, unfortunately, he's not that interesting. If he weren't running for president, I would have chucked the book after Indonesia. Black, white, black, white...whine, whine...yawn.This man has no acomplishments to justify anyone voting for him."
1,Master of Disguise,President Barak Obama is a master of disguise. He is definitely the most dishonest US President this country has ever had. This book reveals the audacity he has lived his life by. What a fraud!
2,?,Is this an autobiography? What is the point of this book? What about the majority of Obama's life and relationships? I see no real mention of his mother and maternal sister as he became a adult.
5,Dreams from my Father:Race and inheritance;audiobook,"This is a great look into the making of this man and his honesty, compassion and open outlook on life. The fact that he narrates it with various voices makes it really extraordinary."
5,Reality check,Superbly written and facts well documented. A real eye-opener. America needs to wake up and make some real changes or our future is in jeopardy
1,EGOTISTICAL MAD MAN THAT IS A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"Now technically this is my husband's review not mine...he told me what to say after he read it. I refused to read it...the movie 2016 was more than enough for me. It made my throw-up in my mouth to spend money on this rag. As Gene saw in another review..if people had read this book before the last election he would not even have been on the ticket. This man is a threat to the life we new when we were growing up. Already many of us have seen the changes and none of them have been good. He is a threat, he is a threat, he is a threat...see the movie 2016 and GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE. I guess it is a good thing that this is my husbands review...I would never be so kind."
1,Begging for other formats,"Of all the books that deserve ALL multiple formats, it is this one! There needs to be a cassette tape version that is unabridged. There needs to be a cassette version that is abridged. There needs to be a CD version that is unabridged. Any version that would increase access to the reading public to this book should be done. Please, please, please, publishers, yes, there is a market!!!!"
1,Self-serving,It's not so much what he says as how he says it. You have to read between the lines to get his real meaning.
1,What a barbarian he eats dog,"I don`t care what country i`m in, I would never eat dog. That`s gross. Cant believe this guys our president. Our founding fathers needed to create more qualifications to become president."
1,Ghost Written Narcissism,"I read this and all recent books claimed to have been written by Obama. I also read that he had help from professional and ghost writers. Obama's books are more narcissism than evidence of a concern for social and economic justice under the US Constitution. Obama is just another great orator with less maturity, experience, and wisdom than most of our national and world thinkers. This book is just one more work of liberal Democrat propaganda. We all have dreams from our fathers...and mothers...but we choose to leave them out of print, so the book is just campaign and election fodder from a youthful and naive left-wing radical...and his even more left-wing and radical revolutionaries. At least Obama can truthfully claim to be African-American, an geographic-ethnic classification claimed in error by most other American blacks. After all, Obama may have been born in Africa and flown to Hawaii, or at least his father was a full African."
1,The State Department loves this book.,"The State Department loves this book.The U.S. Department of State has bought more than $70,000 worth of books authored by President Obama[...]"
5,Well written and informative,This book helped me see the character of our now President and understand the foundation of his dreams. It is well written and informative and I found it difficult to put down.
5,A thoughtful new president,"I am impressed by Obama's ability to analyze himself. In ""Dreams from my Father,"" he readily points out his adolescent flaws, frustrations, and misunderstandings in a way no sitting politician ever could. Historians should be very grateful that he wrote this before he ran for elected office. I cannot think of another memoir by a politician that seemed so unfiltered and human.By the way, Obama is a beautiful writer. His sentences are smooth and at times lyrical. I look forward to having a president so well versed in the English language."
5,The path of preparation...,"This book, which I read twice, helped me understand the background of Barack Obama which has prepared him in a most fundamental way to run for president at this time in history. He embodies unity in diversity from his ""black"" father and ""white"" mother, his upbringing in another culture in Indonesia, to his education in a culturally diverse Hawaii, with strong Grandparents representative of American values, and then on to LA and then NY and Chicago. He carries the back African strength that has not been influenced by slavery, and his position now is symbolic and a wonderful outcome to the years of disempowerment the black community has suffered in our country. The book is inspirational, insightful and a real treasure."
5,It Will Keep Your Attention,"Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance is the recounting of his life up until the time just before he began law school. It covers the time he spent community organizing. It is an honest riveting account written in a descriptive entertaining writing style. Thoroughly enjoyable, this book gives great insight into the man and his actions."
5,Obama autobiography excellent information about our next president's history,"I really liked this book. It gives a great background on President-elect Obama and touches in a positive way on the way he grew up and what he took the time to learn about his heritage.It answers many questions about his heritage, history, and his formative years."
1,Mr Obama's Review,"I think Mr Obama says it best by replacing business with book.I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got best selling bool -- you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."
4,A Man With A Plan,"Barack Obama, in search of himself, has placed himself under the microscope not by us (tho we'd like to think that) but HIMSELF. In an attempt to find a meaning to the legacy his father left for him, he can only establish the first movements of etching his steps in the sands of time. What we conclude in this inspiring movement, is not confusion, or the search of a father, but well organized thoughts of expression that places the emphesis on the road that is less often traveled. Rarely do one reveal where they came from - with a glimps of where they are going. I can't seem to understand how others have become so critical in reviewing the lost moments in anothers life. By choice or design, I think Barack will some day find out who he really is, with all the world watching. I can only hope that what he really finds is a man of substance. ""Dreams from My Father"" very powerful yet sad."
4,Interesting,This was a good way to get to know what influenced our next President. Written long before he had any idea of going into politics so it had no hidden agenda. This helped to refute some false claims during the campaign and confirm some that he would like to have made go away. No matter what your party preference this is very informative. This should be on every high school Social Studies teacher's reading list after the inauguration to get kids interested in taking part of the democratic process while they are still acutely aware that our nation has taken another important step.
3,insight into Obama,"perhaps only those who have experienced some degree of prejudice will truly appreciate this ? It is a revealing portion of the life of Obama. He is a good writer and from this you can learn he is INDEED a good ""organizer""...got a used car you need selling ??!!"
3,Dreams from My Father....,"In reading other reviewers' comments, I too feel as if the content of this memoir was different from what I had expected.I too felt that Obama's mother and maternal grandparents were kind of left out in the cold, although they were the ones who raised, nurtured, and loved him.On the other hand, the book is mostly devoted to his father - a man who abandoned Obama - and his fathers side of the family.I thought Obama was half white and half black, but after reading this book, I believe he is only black."
1,ALERT! Warning on this Abridged version....,"Before ordering this audiobook, be aware that it has been further abridged to remove all references to 'Frank', Obama's acknowledged 'mentor' and 'role model' and 'second father'..Who was Frank? Frank Marshall Davis- Communist, Pedophile, pornographer...with a 600 page FBI FILE..you don't have to believe me; just google or bing it...further proof that Obama is a fake, fraud and liar...sorry to disapoint all you followers of the 'Obamassiah'. This is the man who apologizes to Islam for our First Amendment Rights in our Constitution, and then edits out incriminating evidence from his own works. There are older, unabridged versions available from used dealers."
5,Dreams From My Father,I enjoyed this book very much. I feel like I know this special man so much better after reading this book. I would recommend it to anyone. It's really very interesting.
4,Enjoy Reading,"Obama makes little mention of his white half -- although by his own account he was lovingly brought up by his white mother and her parents, and this might have provided further answers to the questions he raises about himself and where he belongs. Obama, whom I admire as a political leader in Chicago, is young; the book is hard to read. Obama seems to say that people of mixed backgrounds must choose only one of those backgrounds in which to make a spiritual home."
3,"A reasonable book, but the agenda gets in the way","The book was well written and interesting in that it provided a coherent window into what his early years were like. I enjoyed it as a sociological study, but found it a little melodramatic in his portrayal of the absent father and his Kenyan relatives. I looked forward to the insight into his mother's family and never received it. Those characters were portrayed as flat and without real value in his life. Their care and support of him throughout his entire life was discounted completely. As the book went on, I became keenly aware that this was written to be a vehicle for the advancement of Obama's political career and to illustrate the fact that he is seeking to maximize his image as an advocate for the downtrodden. By the end of the book I felt as if I had been force fed an alternate and embellished history of Obama's life."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I HAVE ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK. HE(OBAMA) IS A TRUE SPIRIT. IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT NO MATTER WHAT PROBLEMS YOU HAVE IN LIFE, YOU CAN GET THROUGH THEM."
1,A Narcissist's Blog,"I felt I was reading a story about a Narcissist who was trying to justify how great he thought he was. It could have been about a ""Hitler"" in the making. I read it to the end and felt so discouraged, knowing this man today."
1,Our national media is not doing its job.,"After reading this book, I am convinced that we must do everything in our power to elect Mitt Romney as our next president. How Obama got elected in the first place is the fault of the national media for not doing its homework and exposing this fraudulant person. May God help us!"
4,What?,"One question before I buy this book: Will it contribute to the Obama campaign ( or his agenda to downsize our great country) ?I'd hate to know that I helped him in any way, as he is on a fast track to ruining America, but I'd like to read the book."
1,Dreams From My Father,Mostly a bunch of lies but does show the real reason behind Obama's wild departure from our Constitution. He is totally mad at the United States.
2,Dreams From My Real Father,"Obama is a fake. His real father is Frank Marshall Davis. The birth certificate that he has presented is a blatant forgery. We are all being duped. Please keep an open mind and wake up. The rabbit hole is profoundly deep but only by facing it will we bring ourselves out of darkness.The book may be eloquent and a good read but it is a composite so it would be foolish to take any of it at face value. You have to do a little digging and read between the lines to find the truth on this man. And good luck with that, since he has sealed ALL of his records."
1,Revealing,"If the entire country had listened to this book before the 2008 election, he wouldn't have ever even been on the ticket. The democrats could have had Hillary Clinton as President and maybe something to brag about. Instead, the entire world has this loser as adequatley described in his own words. Get this book and pass it around ASAP."
1,Could not finish it,"Back in 2008, I read ""Who Wrote Dreams From My Father?"" on the 'American Thinker' website.So last summer when I was given a copy of 'Dreams From My Father', I was looking forward to reading it.But, the book was so uninteresting, after a few chapters, I returned it to it's owner.(And it turns out, she had not read it either).My guess is, a lot of liberals have this book laying on their coffee table, unread.If anyone does plan on buying this book, you might want to avoid reading""Who Wrote Dreams From My Father?"" By Jack Cashill. It might spoil it for you."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book because I wanted to know more about Obama. I wanted (and expected) to like him, but unfortunately I was disappointed. This book has a very whiny, ""poor me"" kind of tone. Not to say that black people don't have a tough time, but there seems to be a lot of blaming ""the white man"" and ""white folks"" in general. News flash: we ""white folks"" don't just sit around plotting how we can make black folks' lives difficult.Recommended reading: The Forgotten Man by Amity Shlaes"
4,Dreams review,This book gives a good insight into Obama's personal philosophy and worldview. It gives a greater perspective of the motivations behind his decisions as president. Very eye opening.
1,Grade-A Tripe,"If you can get past the abominably poor language and grammar, composite characters, changed names, dramatized events, and fictionalized dialogue, your reward is...a tedious, overwrought, melodramatic, self-serving memoir about nothing from a 34-year old dilettante. Whether your politics place you on the left or right, the fact is DREAMS FROM MY FATHER is a clumsy, amateurish effort with little insight and even less truth, and it probably would have been more compelling and weighty had Obama waited until later in his life, after he actually accomplished something, to reflect on and write about his formative experiences. In contrast to the image propagated by mythologizers in his campaign and elements of the media, Obama demonstrates little skill as a writer and his work here falls far short of publication quality. DREAMS FROM MY FATHER shows that it's probably best for Obama that he didn't pursue a career as an author, though inarguably not so for the country."
1,Ghost Written,"Sadly, it now seems that Mr. Obama had the book ghost written by neighbor Bill Ayers. Christopher Andersen's new book Barack and Michelle: Portrait of an American Marriage due out soon says that Michelle said when the deadline was approaching Barrack shipped his files and tapes out to Bill Ayers to write the book.His creditability would have been enhanced by admitting this upfront just as many, many famous ""authors"" do."
2,not bad,"this book is not so good as i expected. there is no a clear line connecting these chapters, like a pearl lace without the line, stories are scattered here and there."
3,Dreams from My Father,"Book was okay. Decent reading. However, I wanted to get more insight into Obama before election. Learned nothing. I expected clarification of his ideas/ideals."
5,Rewarding,A wonderful book - well written and engaging from beginning to end. Great to get to know the author thru this book.
5,Dreams From My Father,"I could not put this eloquently written life and family story down; it is a wonderful book revealing keen powers of observation, expression, maturity, self-knowledge and a worldliness that comes of wide travel and exposure. I hope that many take the time to read it, and that more of the lessons in its message can be applied to our national life."
4,go obama,wonderful reading about the wonder-boy. Is this guy going to sweep the democrats into the whitehouse in 2008? Can he create actual excitement for a bored and disillusioned electorate? Well he's got me interested. A bit too much info about working in the innercity projects but you get the sense that the experience will stand him in good stead in working for the people.
3,Dreams From My Grandfather,There were three major parts to Barack Obama's story. His childhood in Hawai and his journey to Kenya were interesting. His work in Chicago as a activist was unimpressive and the narrative dragged and was confusing in this section. His grandparents on his mother's side were the stable force in his childhood and were very accepting of their biracial grandson. Barack's mother seemed to pursue her own interests. His father was not in the picture. The strongest part of Barack's story was his meeting with his African relatives and his reflections on this
2,An Ajusted Memoir,"I rated this two stars only because it was well edited. The story itself seems to be an effort of Obama to redefine his life story for his own devices. His anecdotes seem contrived when they dis white people, wealthy people, corporations, oil companies and all the regular bugaboos of leftists.Although the story is fictionalized in that certain folks and events are composites, I just flat don't believe his story how rich white folks used to walk their dogs into his neighborhood to crap - that's just pure you-know-what.All in all, a self-aggrandizing story by a self-aggrandizing man."
3,An Okay but not Great Book.,I found the continuous introspection a bit tiring. Apart from that the book is very well written an gave me an insight into Obama's background which have obviously influeneced his policies as President.
5,A wonderful story...,"This was a wonderfully written book, that was entertaining as well as insightful. It is a modern American Story."
3,Impressive,"A literary ""Tour de Force"" in the genre. Standing shoulder to shoulder with such masterpieces as Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Harry Potter and the works of the Grimm Brothers."
3,Disappointing,"In terms of insight to the man, it is a rather disappointing memoir. Not to take anything away from him though, as he does appear to be the real deal in US politics, since JFK.I expected the book to be a revelation as to how he developed his character and ideas. To understand the circumstances that had forged his personality. And I was let down. As it turns out the book is merely an account of his life-journey just before getting into Harvard. In the end, you get to see that his is an ordinary life, except maybe for the fact that he has an 'international' family background. Even that, does not explain the makings of the man.So, if you're looking to understand what made Barack Obama into the phenom that he is today, this is not the book my friends."
4,Dreams of my Father & Jennifer Hudson,The item was received in a very short time; pleased with the condition it arrived in.
3,"Some of it very interesting, other to many details and examplres. Hard to track who is who.",I found a lot of it boring. Enjoyed beggining and ending of book and Obama's time in Africa.
4,Insightful and interesting,"This story is a testament of the opportunities available to anyone living in the U.S. Doors seem to open for those who have applied themselves through learning and education. This was truly a testament of the resolve of the mother to make sure her son was well educated and devoted her time supplementing public education with home education.The story revealed some of the positive and negative of the life of Barack Obama, his family history on three continents. It was a revealing insight to the struggles a young man faces not having a father in his life.It is an amazing story."
4,Came quick,"The book was delivered quick although I thought the cover was not in the best condition. I would not have classified this as ""Good"" condition although I suppose it could have been a lot worst. There were a lot of creases in the cover. The rest of the book seems to be in good condition though."
4,Good read,"If one can read this book with an open mind and not a political overlay, it is a wonderful story of a black man in america. As he has become the president, I feel it helps better understand his perspective on the world - open and inclusive, not closed and selective. His thoughtful, reflectivenss that is at times interpreted as ""cold"" seems just the normal way of a natural introvert. Well written, good read."
5,Must Read,"Dreams from My Father is an autobiographical narrative of Barack Obama's life, pre-Washington, from birth to his tenure as State Senator of Illinois.I've heard this called a political manifesto... but it's not; rather a story of a struggling journey from boyhood to man for someone who doesn't quite fit in anywhere -- someone that is too white for the black culture of his youth, and too black for whites to embrace. It's a story of struggle, of race, and of finding ones place in world of very clear-cut rules and social norms.And this is a page turner if there ever was one. Not only does Obama have a story to tell, he writes it with clear and gripping prose. The narrative sucks you in early and never lets go, leaving you wanting more at the very end. And better still, with each turn of the page the reader is self-reflecting as much as they are engaging in the narrative itself.I don't give many five star ratings, but this book is definitely deserves one. It's a must read for everyone!"
4,Beautiful,"Out of fairness i wanted to get a more personal feeling of at that time our President to be, so I ordered 3 books. They were interesting. This one was the best and very lovely. The other books only reinforced my opinion that He will take us into more government control and cost."
3,too much at times.. but not enough,"listening to this audio book in my car created an intense curiosity to understand barack more. although this book is somewhat inspiring ,it truly reads like a long,drawn out novel at times giving too much information in one direction ,but not enough in others. of course I realize that it is incomplete, maybe I feel like the author jumped the gun to create this too soon. At certain points it feels rushed,then again It can appear evasive.. some chapters were entirely too verbose and I needed and auditory break."
3,Dreams from my Father,"Quite revealing and explanatory about Obama's beliefs. His formative years were not in America, but in Indonesia. He always harbored resentment toward races other than Black and Asian."
1,living written proof,. its obvious that he wanted nothing to do with his mothers family from an identity standpoint no matter how well they raised and treated him
5,Poignant in insightful read into,"I read this book last summer and it raised a mixture of emotions:- at times he disappointed and even angered me...at other times I was inspired proud and elevated. One thing that was constant is the fact that Barack Obama is a beautiful writter. His honesty also shines through. I think thats what made me angry at times, as he did not always do or think the way that he should- or rather the way I expected the 'future' first black president of the USA to act or think. He was, in this book, very much an ordinary man navigating his way through life, making mistakes as we all do and making the best of things. It was comforting to see that even this great man still grappled with self doubt, identity issues and just the trouble of figuring out just what to do in life. I loved it because just like life sometimes it made me laugh, made me angry, made me think and made me cry. A great book, a great man and a great read!"
1,Waste of time and Money,"A communist manifesto for the new generation, Do yourself a favor and save your money and buy the original... deserves zero stars"
4,Good and on time but slower than average,Everyone should read this book. It will help us understand ourselves as well as our president. Company delivered as promised but slower than most.
5,Well worth reading!,"Barack Obama's first book, though autobiographical, reads like a novel. I wanted to know what makes this man tick, and this book painted a straightforward and fascinating picture. After having been the first black President of Harvard Law Review, Obama wrote this book the year following his graduation from law school. Though I can't afford the signed, limited edition, I'm buying a another paperback to send to my Mom. It's a great way to learn a great deal about what's behind this remarkable, historic figure who has drawn millions of people -- young and old, men and women, all races, even all over the world. Next, I'm going to read Audacity of Hope!!"
3,An enjoyable memoir,"I enjoyed this very personal memoir, especially the middle section on his work as an organiser in Chicago. The material in the last third of the book when Obama returns to Africa to trace his roots is a little less engaging primarily because it gets bogged down in family details that are clearly important to the writer but tend to slow the narrative to a dragging pace. Overall an impression is given of Barack Obama as a compassionate, intelligent and thoughtful person. I look forward to reading his more developed political ideas in his ""Audacity of Hope"" and of course seeing how it all works out once he is in the White House."
4,Dreams from my Father,"Everyone should read this book on our president. It gives you a window on his belief formations. It is amazing that he has become such a well rounded, intelligent and empathic person with such ever changing early years."
5,Best book ever,a truly amazing book. an in depth look at Obama's life from childhood to adulthood. i recommand this book to young scholars who are curious about our next president's life.
1,Dreams of Bill Ayres,Obama didn't write this book; at least not all of it. Check out 'Deconstructing Obama.' The similarities between Ayres' writing and what we are TOLD is Obama's prose are far too great to be coincidental.
2,Now I Understand the Man!,"President Obama was my choice for President even though I am a Republican. I wanted to live long enough to see a black president. He seemed like a great guy, well spoken and a chance for change. Maybe some day he will be ready but he was not ready to be President when elected. Now that I have read this book, I understand him and his experiences in life or lack thereof. He is so puffed up, so arrogant. He lived an unusual life from the time he was born. It is hard to believe he is just as much white as black. His choice of friends and life style i.e. drugs, are the real Obama. The facade that got him elected is created but not to be believed. I am glad I read this book. I cannot vote for him again. I still hope I live long enough to see a great, first full black president!"
2,Interesting read...made me dislike him even more,"I found this book to be rather enlightening on how Obama feels about his family history and his country. I recommend people read this to learn the kind of person they have elected to be president of our country, which seems to be a country he doesn't show much love for."
2,I just Didn't like the style.,"As I have said before all biography is a form of advocacy and this book isno exception.For some Reason I didn't like the narrative structure that Obama choose tous in telling his story. Because of the style I didn't find myself able toemotionally connect with his story and It lowered my enjoyment of the book.That being said I still Think that people should read this book because thefirst step in figuring out what a person is like(i,e. vetting) is to read whatthey say about themselves. Not enough people did that In 2008 and they have achance to do so now before the next presidential election of 2012."
5,Informed electorate,"No matter whom you support in the 2008 presidential election, this book is an important read -- not to mention compelling and insightful."
5,Well satisfied.,The book was just what I was looking for. I presume I will have much pleasure in reading and maybe passing it on to my family for them to enjoy.
2,Racist,It was interesting only in the fact that it shows the Authors true dislike of the white race without a lot of basis to his feelings
4,A life story told with courage and compassion,Gives an insight into the life and family of one of the most gifted politicians of our times.
1,Beware the deceiver,"Quotes from this book. Talented? Eloquent? Complex? Inspiring? Come on people wake up before it is too late.'I ceased to advertise my mother's race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites.''I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race.''There was something about him that made me wary, a little too sure of himself, maybe. And white.''I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own. It was into my father's image, the black man, son of Africa , that I'd packed all the attributes I sought in myself , the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela.'"
1,Curious That's All!,"I bought this book because I was curious. Frankly, I'm not voting for Obama and wanted to fact check some comments myself. This is especially true because the movie 2016 is drawing mostly on comments in this book as well as on the book The Raae of Obama. I didn't want, however, to contribute to Obama's millions of dollars of rolayties so I bought this book for 1 cent. I stopped reading it after 10 mpages and threw it away. Actaully, I threw it out with th reclyes bin.I remebereed later that their was talked that J. Ayers, the self avowed murderer, was the ghost author of this book. I'm gald I threw it away and will just watch the 2016 DVD I recently ordered."
1,His being a racist shows clearly in this book.,"""Crackers"" is as insulting to me as the N-word that we're NOT allowed to say on here, is to them.And for him to refer to his grandmother as a ""typical white woman??"" what's that about? cuz he's a ""typical mulatto?"""
1,"Racist, Communist","Anyone who voted for this man should be ashamed of themselves! He is ruining our country with his racist, communist crap."
1,FICTION,Should be reclassified as an autofabrication.A total set of lies of an empty life by an empty suit.Made it all up.The man is a hoax.
2,Amazon Pulled My First Review...I'll Try Again...,"I wrote a hasty review and spoke my true feelings about Barack Hussein Obama's memoir of self-discovery. Amazon refused to publish it probably because I said what I think: this book proves him to be a racist.However, I won't reproduce my work, rather, I will leave you with this following warning: Mein Kaumph was Adolf Hitler's assessment of what needed to be done. Dreams of my Father is Barack H. Obama's warning to the world. He is no Martin Luther King. Think Malcom X, and you get the idea. Peace out."
2,Disappointed,"I felt that the Obama hadn't mastered a unified voice. The narration veered from lyrical to vernacular to ungrammatical colloquial--and all in the narrator's voice. Obama didn't identify his own voice and then let characters speak in their voices; his voice shifted in tone and language so much that I felt he evoked an ""unreliable narrator."" I don't think that was his intention. As a result, the potentially moving aspects of the book were diminished."
2,Okay...,"I swallowed this book for the first ten pages. It was intriguing, conversational, and I was excited to read about the man I voted for. I was into this book all the way up until he went to Africa. After he went to visit his family, there were just too many names and characters involved and I went from being confused to not caring at all. The author would tell me things like someone sipped a cup of tea. In a fiction story, that matters--in a nonfiction story, it's irrelevant. Many of the things Barack encountered while in Africa were unnecessary to tell me in this book although they may have been imperative to him. Every once in awhile, I'd hear a good story from his grandmother, I liked to hear about his father and grandfather growing up, but all the cousins/midwives/brothers/sisters etc. were a bore to read about."
3,"Our President, interesting man, not so interesting writer.","Written by a young man needing to speak of the world he knows. I read this book because of the critics. Only interesting enough to want to see into the the presidents personal history and understand a little of how he arrived at his current perspective. Also to realize that his critics are generally not interested in what the president is about, but only want to tear down a man who is genuine in his ideas and patriotism, whether you agree with him or not. I have the feeling the critics did not read the same book I read. Not interesting enough to read just for the sake of reading pleasure."
4,"Red or Blue, you ought to consider this one...","With apologies to my conservative friends, I enjoyed this book and have true respect for the author. Not only was it very well written, but I found myself drawn into the story of Barack's early life, particularly his journey to discover and define the person he would become. Did he do (and think) things I find extreme? Of course he did! Having long since left my own 20-something years (thankfully) undocumented and in my wake, I certainly have no stones to cast. Whether you agree with his politics or not, his story is uniquely American and I believe, great. If I ever got the ""you can invite X-number of fameous persons to dinner"" fantasy, Barack Obama would make my short list.I listened to this one from [...], read by the President himself. I must admit to having a preference for authors reading their own works (even if they aren't as good as professional readers, I find it more genuine). I'd strongly recommend that format to anyone considering this book."
4,An autobiography and biography,"Interesting book, BO (hmmm...) goes on an inspirational quest in search of who his father really was. On his journey, we learn of his racial identity crisis, how he got involved with churches in Chicago and met Jeremiah Wright (and memory of Wright's audacity of hope message, which BO would carry into the 04 speech on this audiobook, and become the title of his 06 book). Makes you wonder how BO could become estranged from Rev JW, who obviously made an impact on his life. This quest for knowledge of his father leads him to Kenya, to hear about all of his father's loves, losses, and children. Every family has it's drama, but the name Obama redefines drama. A very interesting look into the heart of a man in search of his identity and his heritage.Also, Obama reads this book himself, and very well I might add. Excellent for the commute. I listen to audiobooks in my car, and rarely finish audiobooks read by the author because they frequently end up so lame. Not so here."
3,Obama--the early years,"This first autobiography, which was first published in 1995, sheds a lot of light on the early development of Senator Obama. The sections about his first job in Chicago and his trip to Kenya to re-trace his roots are informative. As the title suggests, most of the book is devoted to his search for his father's roots and the considerable influence this mostly-missing father had on his life."
4,Human respect,"Mr. Barack Obama story is the wonderful truths of all people. His perceptions are uncomfortable and loving at the same time. There are NO full blooded people here that are Americans including Indians and if we all just knew OUR OWN HISTORY we could help our nation. Obama's story is wonderful and all thinking people should read it and I am sure you will find yourself in it and all your family, because we can tell almost the same story."
5,Dreams From My Father,"I just finished Senator Obama's book and it was an extraordinary account of the life his man has led and experienced. He has traveled the lives of so many cultures, people, and countries most of us will never have the opportunity to do. This confirms my decision to vote for him for out next presidential candidate and really tells me all that he says is true and sincere. Kudos to Senator Obama!!"
4,Dreams From My Father,"I enjoyed the story, especially the part where Barack returns to his roots. I thought the first half of the book was a bit slow in parts"
5,Dreams from my Father,"Very insightful book. This book reveals a lot about President Obama's world view, how he came to these and why he wants to make changes in the US. I respect this understanding of self and the world around us, it is deeply thoughtful and helps us to fully understand the work he is doing. Great read."
5,Researching the Man,The man who wrote the book does not seem to be the man presented for the Presidency. This promotes a somewhat scary situation of mind-set of the man. It is a must read before the election.
4,Identity struggle told eloquently,"I read this book during the weekend my youngest sister got married. His search for his identity, while familiar to anyone who had gone through adolescence, resonated with me as a person whose own narrative is not the neat ethnic line, strong family ties type. He eloquently described his continuing struggle to prove himself black, while equivocating on his drive and acheivements. I felt like I got to know him in a way we rarely do a political candidate. Since it was written before he ever ran for public office, it is spin-free (unless you believe those that say he played up his drug use for ""street cred"").This is a story of someone who felt himself an outsider in a any group he ""belonged"" too. If you have any variation in your background, you will enjoy this book too."
1,"Too much ""me""","This book is less about the problem of gang violence and more about Tom Haydens contributions to the effort. Most of the book is a self-congratulatory pat on the back. Hayden spends much of his time arguing as to why we have failed to prevent this problem, yet he offers no concrete solutions. Furthermore, he refused to even acknowledge that law enforcement does have a part to play whether we like it or not.If you want to read about Haydens personal experience then this book is good, but if your looking for answers then you came to the wrong place."
1,Totally useless.,"I met this guy today at Cal State Long Beach at a panel discussion he gave with a few other authors. Talk about a waste of time. This guy is so full of himself that I'd be surprised if he could see past his ego far enough to actually help the gang problem. I'm not sure what his problem is, but he sure is rude, unpleasant, and devoid of any progressive ideas.I would suggest staying as far away from this egomaniac as possible, and spending your money on a book by another author."
3,sweet,"The entire Christmas series by Donna Van Liere is touching. She has once again found a way to share the Christmas spirit with her readers. All of her stories make you rethink what's really important in our lives. The Christmas Hope delivers the same warm and fuzzy vibe. However, it does lack any element of surprise or climax. This is a great novel for lounging around and reading by a fire. Hope you enjoy!"
5,Do not miss this book!,"Donna Vanliere is one of the best inspirational writers today. She writes in the tradition of Dickens and O. Henry. She weaves a great tale, keeps the reader's interest, and throws in an uplifting message for good measure. Vanliere delivers romance, suspense, and inspiration in another great book. I cannot get enough of her writing!Also recommended:Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices--a book in the tradition of Vanliere.The Christmas Wish--a marvelous story"
5,Hope in Tribulation,"If you need Hope this Christmas, this is the first book you need to pick up. You will be highly newed and refreshed. I cannot outdo any of the outstanding reviews already written, but will state that new life was breathed into me as I read this book. If you are facing a depressing season at Christmas, and many people do for a multitude of reasons, this is the book for you. You will be drawn back into the gift of giving and out of your blues. This book is utterly about Hope."
5,Such a well written series,"This book is part of an incredible series, one that draws you in and keeps you. I am amazed at how touched I am by these dramatic books every holiday season."
1,The Christmas Hope,Amazon ran out of the book so I never receivd it. Since it was probably to much trouble for amazon to get another I belive I was given a credit...can't read credits.First time I have had such bad service from amazon...I know yu realize there are other online distributer's who provide the same service...maybe they can fullfill orders on time.Joe Kippel
2,"Flimsy, short cord, wouldn't stay connected","I agree with the other negative review above. The photo is of the standard LG charger, but the one you get is a flimsy knock-off that didn't work well. The cord was really short and the damn thing didn't stay connected. It didn't really ""snap-in"" well and kept popping out. I ended up just buying a real replacement cord from a store -- more expensive, but it worked perfectly."
2,beware: misleading ad,"From the product description, you would never guess that this is not made by LG. When they call it an ""LG Travel Charger,"" when Amazon describes it as a ""lightweight, genuine LG charger,"" and when the photo they show is of the OEM LG charger, it's hard to conclude otherwise.But no. The only name on the box is Wireless Phone Accessories, made in China. The charger you get is not the one pictured in the ad. It looks different, and it is obviously lighter and cheaper feeling. I just plugged mine in, and it seemed to work just fine.Is this product worth 50 cents plus $5 shipping? That's for you to decide. But one doesn't expect to get the bait & switch from Amazon, and I'll be returning it."
1,Doesn't fit vx3300!,Great price but it doesn't fit the vx3300. The purchase price was so low that it wasn't worth my time to return it.
4,older cell phone,the charging cord & battery were exactly what I needed to keep my older cell phone going. It works fine again. Products were not available locally.
1,didnt work,"didnt work on my phone the vx3200, disappointed! needed this badly, now i have to order a different one! a waste of time and money!"
4,A fine replacement,Somehow I broke my original charger. This one filled the bill at a very reasonable cost.
5,"Great Product, shipped quickly, at a great price!",Title says it all! We got a great charger for the cell phone at a price that was significantly better than the competition! It shipped qickly and worked flawlessly.
4,Ninja Trickery,"Secrets of the Ninja is a wonderful (but a bit thin) book about the techniques of the ninja, the mysterious subclass of the samurai. This book is a delightful read, but talks more about the techniques the ninja used than what they actully were. With interesting information about how ninja told time, ninja exercises, tools, ninja moves and more, this book is for the slightly interested American, not a person who already knows tons of information about ninjutsu. Falling into the first catagory, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It will keep you laughing till the end, but has only 90 or so pages, so dont expect that much. Most of this book was pictures, which many people probably like. All in all, this book was very interesting and not at all dense. I cant really say whether it is worth your money or not, because it really depends on the person."
4,The first Painted Skin was Great,This movie falls a little short of the first one but it was still good. I guess if you want to see where the players went after the first movie you better see this one.
1,Glad I watched it for free(some spoilers) :P,"Pros:Starts off keeping your attention(even though its your typical drama)Some funny moments in the movieOk actionVery beautiful looking movieThe bird girlCons:Fox demon was cursed for saving a human man and his wife but she goes around taking out men's hearts(contradiction in character's morals)Fox demon finally finds someone to willingly give her their heart only to swap back like a day later, wtf??Movie was good until she meets the queen with the scarred face and its all about seducing her and manipulating her love interestThe way the queens love interest snaps out of the curse was so bogusOverall: I would recommend watching online for free or renting but never buying this, it drags on way too long. It goes from really interesting to typical,boring romance crap with a fox demon once the fox demon meets up with the queen with the scarred face. This movie is ok at best."
4,"Good, Comprehensive Book on Wi-Fi Security","Edney tackles quite a broad topic, but does well with remaining focused and developing the topic from a novice understanding of wireless security to in-depth discussions down to the packet level. With the range of the topic, the book could have easily been written *only* for the novice or specifially for the computer professional, but Edney manages to hit both audiences; not a small feat when writing a computer-related book.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding why wi-fi networks are vulnerable (more so than traditional wired networks) and in learning more about wi-fi security solutions."
5,Simply the best wpa/802.11i book I have seen,The author really knows what he is talking about. The layout of content shows his strong logical reasoning. He answers almost all questions a curious engineer would have.
2,Awful!,I bought these because the price was great and the reviews were great and Clark's is supposed to be great so I thought these would be great. I bought my true size (8.5M) and they are too small. They are very tight but I thought that they would loosen up after wearing them. BIG MISTAKE! After walking in them for 15 minutes they rubbed several bleeding sores onto my foot - not blisters actual cuts in my foot - that are still healing some time later. The suntan is also an odd color that isn't really neutral and seems to go with nothing really except other pink things. I was totally disappointed!
5,book,So glad I purchased this book. It was true to the description and perfect for parenting my two 20 something children. Have recommended to my friends.
5,Practice anywhere,"These balls give a realistic flight pattern and can be used in a very small backyard. They don't last forever and are no good for chipping, but I strongly recommend them for warming up the full swing almost anywhere with no need for a mat."
2,Fluffy navel gazing,"As a resident of the neighborhood in Austin where some of the ""action"" in the book took place, I'd say Pollack got the details right. But the overall tone of the book is a bit narcissistic and juvenile. Hard to be a good father when you refuse to grow up yourself."
2,Comes Up Short,This quilt was made well enough but it is way too short by 6-8 inches from covering the top of the bed lengthwise.
4,Nice,I read the other reviews and because of what others said I bought the king size even though my bed is a queen. I wish I would have just stuck with the right size. Don't get me wrong...I love it but the queen size would have looked just fine and would not have been to small.It is not real thin and so far has kept me pleanty warm without an additional blanket.
5,Better Together,Like Amazon says - this book is better together with The Stock Market Course (main book.)It provides real case studies and helps test the knowledge you WILL learn if you read the other book - you can't skip an entire semester and show up for the final expecting to know the answers. Take mine and Amazon's recommendation and get both of the books together!
5,Excellend detail & quality,"Purchased two of these for a trip out west (canyons). Also purchased two others while out there (one nagalene & one High Sierra). The Camelbacks were much superior in construction, details, and usr friendly features. I paid about half the price of the others as well (by buying on Amazon). Totally satisfied with these (regret the other brands purchased)."
5,Can't get any better than this!,"Made for females which also use water, hike and bicycle. I love the weight even with water inside filled to the top. Go for it, you won't be disappointed at all. 5 stars all the way."
2,Less then you would expect,I am teaching Java in a middle school with only Macs in the computer lab and had picked this book for several reasons1. I had used Learn C on the MacIntosh and was very pleased with it.2. Code Warrior Lite was included.I ended up apologizing to the class for having them buy the book. CW Lite should not be bundled in a book for beginners. It is cripple ware which will not let you create your own files and so is only barely useful for anything other than running the sample code.The book itself is very disappointing. While it does do a fairly good job on the basics of the language for the most part it ignores the packages. It was hard to create interesting exercises based on what they had read in the book. While I am a firm believer in learning the basics of a language leaving the packages out to the extent which they did makes this a particularly bad book for learning.
3,Thank you for the memories,If you are over 40 and speak spanish (weather Spaniard or South American ) then you will love this album. beautiful songs bring good memories.
5,Exactly What I Needed!,"Transformative Love is one of the most helpful books on relationships I have ever read. It really spoke to me. It gives great advise on how to choose a partner, create intimacy, work through anger, and heal wounds between partners. A great part of the book is that it gives exercises that you can do with a partner to build trust and intimacy. To anyone who is looking to heal the separation they feel from a partner or who would like to become closer, I would highly recommend this book."
3,"A good book, but flawed","As other reviewers have noted, this book contains a wealth of material: techniques, examples, and problems that will introduce the reader to new concepts and/or hone their abilities. The problem sections at the end of each chapter alone are a boon for anyone studying for the ""big"" math competitions (IMO, Putnam, etc.), as they are extensive and include solutions.The reason I am giving the book 3 stars instead of 5 is that it appears to me to contain a number of errors, and inaccuracies/ambiguities of language. To a mathematically mature reader these may not pose much of a problem, but to a less-seasoned problem solver they might be rather perplexing. If you fall into the latter category, I would suggest, as another reviewer recommended, that you have the ready assistance of a more experienced person."
5,"If you want to be an IMO champ, get this book","This book must be your Bible if you are dead serious about IMO. It is not a good one to start with. Read about psychology of problem solving. I'd say 'Mathematical Problem Solving' by Alan Schoenfeld. Paul Zeitz has written a fantastic book which speaks a lot about psychology of problem solving quite a bit. This book lacks in that department; however, this book is simply the best book out there for someone trying to prepare for the Olympiad and has already been preparing for it with other more easy books."
1,FAIL- does not come with POE (from CircuitCity),"Ordered this from Circuit City. The wrong model arrived. Instead of Netgear - Switch 8-PRT 10/100+4-PRT POE (FS108PNA), I got model FS108, which does not come with the power over ethernet. Beware."
5,Best in the business!,"Hi,I just wanted to say that these Lamps are the best I have found.I have tried many different brands, and found that the others tend to make noise in which is found in audio equipment, or they just buzz themselves.The ESB seen here are the finest in my mind!The seller/shipper is good too. They pack them well and they ship them out with great speed.Two thumbs up!!"
5,"""normal-looking"" cfl",These are the closest to the incandescents they replace and don't have that greenish office look. The 60 watt is plenty bright - so much so that I'm looking for lower watt ones too.
5,Can't tell the difference,"My wife hates the color on standard CFLs so I bought these, replaced the normal incandescents, and waited to see if she would complain. She didn't even notice the difference and I haven't told her either. It's even a little brighter than a standard 60w incandescent as well so that's a benefit.These aren't instant-on types but they warm up pretty fast to full light output (within 30 seconds). So far they've been an excellent choice for replacement without sacrificing the warm light output from a normal incandescent."
2,Dimmable? Not exactly...,"I wanted to put two of these bulbs on an X-10 circuit, but couldn't because they flickered constantly, even when they were supposed to be off. On a conventional dimmer, they flicker when they're at low light levels. These might be okay as ordinary light bulbs, but they disappoint while dimming and can't be used at all with X-10 controllers."
3,Everyone who says this is,"firmly in Ed Wood territory is 1000% correct. But only in his territory; not in his front yard. Yes, the film is laughable, makes no sense (the ""creature"" scenes are incomprehensible in terms of the plot, and are used several times), and has some of the worst acting ever seen on screen. The WW2 surplus gear on the card table is even funnier, and the creature, of course, is just ridiculous. No, it'll never be Plan 9 or Bride of the Monster, but it's still worth adding to your bad movie collection."
1,so bad its comical,"This movie is the ""WORST"" movie I have ever seen in my life.Its so bad that I believe the director of this film committed suicide.I don't want to go into the storyline because there is'nt any."
2,NOT YOUR WORTH A DIME,"""ROBOT MONSTER"" is the cheapest movie I have ever seen. In the movie you can see Ro-man's face. You can also tell that its in a costume.I have seen better old sci-fi movies than this. I'm telling you after all the other black and white movies you have seen this will probably be your worse.I have seen movies such as: Frankenstein meets the Wolfman, It came from beneath the sea, Creature from the black loogan, and some other movie I dont know what the name of it is but there are these butterflys attacking a city,but Robot Monster is probably the worst of all."
2,"Pretty bad, but...","Okay, you know going in that this will be a bad movie. But if you are young and are just starting to have an interest in film then maybe you can use this to your advantage. You may be able to learn what not to do to make a film. Try to figure just WHY this film is bad instead of taking it for granted. After watching you should look into the history of how this film came to be. It's actually an interesting story. Case in point: If you are making a movie about a ""Robot Monster"" but don't have the budget for a ""Robot"" costume, you should probably realize that you should not even start production instead of using your friend's gorilla suit that he happens to have. Oh, and please note in the opening credits that Elmer Bernstein, who later went on to win an Oscar, wrote the music."
3,redeemed only by the fact that it is so bad it is funny,"I vaguely remember seeing this as a kid. It is about a small band of humans, whose scientific knowledge has allowed them to survive an invasion by a single robotic beast. The beast falls for the teenage girl, betrays his monsterhood, and gets zapped before the earth is completely destroyed (oh, and there are dinosaurs running about as the ground splits open). Everything - actors, effects, plot - are so ridiculously bad that this is for anyone's collection of the truly awful yet funny. I found this on youtube, and would not recommend buying it, but my son and I had some really great laughs watching it together."
4,Classic Early Camp Movie With Some Real Pathos,"This is a really cheap monster movie with a famously camp monster (a gorilla wearing a diver's helmet). It is a boy's dream after he gets a nasty bump on the head. The only other movie which is better as a dream experience is Well's The Trial that I know of. Doing a movie of a dream is all but impossible. The dream aspect is not well established & only reveals itself at the end, probably deliberately. The mounting is pretty believable for it's time except for the monster but very cheap which detracts. The aliens are all powerful & relentless as they hunt down & kill the handful of human survivors. There is a quiet desperation as the humans slowly lose their last fight. The director was so humiliated by the film's failure that he attempted suicide. If you watch it try to keep an open mind, there is more there than is apparent at first glance."
3,"Amzingly bad, and yet coherent","Once you understand the premise of the movie - which I won't give away, but it's not difficult to guess what's going after a half hour of watching - the really awful, absurd, badness of this movie suddenly all fits together and makes, dare I say it, sense. Don't misunderstand me - this is a Z grade movie on a budget that just have been laughable even back in the day, and the special effects, dialogue and plot show it. It just happens to all make total sense in retrospect. Even the dinosaurs. Maybe especially the dinosaurs.But don't watch it because it ultimately makes sense. Watch it to see an actor valiantly try to breathe life, drama and conflict into the role of a robot made up of a monkey suit and a diver's helmet. Watch it to marvel at the stilted dialogue, bizarre behaviour, and utterly shoddy special effects. This is a movie that needs to be goggled at, giggled at and groaned at. A true zircon among the Z grade movies."
1,Too awful to endure!,"I received this DVD for Christmas in the two-pack with Plan 9. I could not get through this one-hour mess, even in the company of 2 good friends with great senses of humor. The ""message"" of the movie was completely lost on us. The basic message of Plan 9 actually made sense, and could have been salvaged with better writing and acting, and the movie as it stands is still ENTERTAINING---you can watch it with any mix of sympathy and mockery. Robot Monster is merely boring. Still, if you're a hard-core fan (and ONLY a hard-core fan) of truly awful cinema, then by all means, don't let this one pass you by!"
2,"A lot of people don't see the point of this movie -- I say, see the entire film and you will understand it","If you see the entire film you will get it and you will not complain about the disjointed, surreal elements. But if you don't give the film a chance and see the entire movie you will not understand the film. It was never meant to be high art in cinema but I am afraid many viewers never understood what the screenwriter was trying to do because they missed the ending."
2,Bubbles Are So Futuristic!,"I think this movie was made for children, and the story seems conceived, at least in part, by a child. Very low budget. Couldn't have cost less unless they shot it right where the camera and recording equipment were stored. Probably good entertainment for 9-year-old boys of the 1950's. Now, it would make a perfect double feature with ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" If you like this kind of crap, as I do, your expectations are already low enough to enjoy this barely competent nonsense."
5,FUNNIEST SCENE MISSING FROM DVD?,I originally saw this film on a local television station and recall a scene which does not appear in my copy of Image's VHS release. I have to wonder if Image used a different print for there DVD transfer. The scene I am referring to occurs about two-thirds of the way through the film and lasts all of about 30 seconds. It's where RoMan is walking down a hillside and encounters some bushes blocking his path and then violently attackes the obstruction and contiunes on his way. I regard this as the goofiest and funiest scene in the film and would not wish to add the DVD to my collection unless this scene appears intact. Can someone out there who has viewed the DVD please let me know if this scene is included.
5,one of the most interestinting sci-fi classics,"This films is actually about a young boy's nightmare and so there's a lot of interpretations that we can find about what happens in the movie. Anyway Ro-man, the robot monster, is one of the most interesting aliens in all movie history because with his astronaut helmet and his hairy gorilla body combines in an astonishing way the thrilling aspects of technics and animal forces. Ro-man is a robot sent to destroy humanity, but he fails and starts aiming to become human and so his sender destroyes him. For half of the film we can see a young man half naked showing his beautiful torso. But it's all just a child's dream!!!"
5,Screwball Comedy Wodehouse Style,"Just today I was making a list of the best-written bits in Wodehouse, and Damsel in Distress topped the list. Gracie Allen of Burns and Allen fame starred in an old black-and-white film based from this book and cast in the Billy Wilder screwball comedy vein. Arguably this book may not top the PGW cannon--nearly everyone would have a Jeeves, Mulliner or Drones book at the pinnacle of great reading--but it does contain some of the most delightful passages in Wodehouse.The movie falls far short of the book simply because it was made when ""All Singing, All Dancing""--(and no plot) was considered a good review for a movie. Any number of PGW novels critique and lampoon his experiences in Hollywood, but seeing the film first and then reading the book, one might be pleasantly surprised. For me, this novel holds up as one of the best non-Jeeves stories, others being French Leave and The Girl On the Boat."
4,"Good fun, what?","If you're a fan of Wodehouse, you know the drill; if you're a newcomer, this is a good introduction. The English are eccentric, the Americans are breezy, and the action is split between the London theater and a rose-covered country manor. What will happen isn't much of a head scratcher; how it will unfold is the pleasure of it."
3,A Damsel In Distress by PG Wodehouse,"Lord Marshmoreton is a widower of some forty-eight years with two children: a son, Percy Wilbraham Marsh, Lord Belpher, who is nearing his twenty-first birthday, and a daughter, Lady Patricia Maud Marsh, who is twenty.The mistress of the castle is Lady Caroline Byng, Lord Marshmoreton's sister, who married the very wealthy colliery owner, Clifford Byng, a few years before his death and she has a step-son, Reginald. Lord Marshmorton spends his time cultivating his rosebeds while Lady Caroline spends a great deal of her time trying to make a match between her stepson & her niece. The butler,Keggs is the narrator of this tale of the courting of Lady Patricia. Imagine everyone's surprise when the man who wins the Lady's hand is a man none of the family expected to have any chance at all."
3,"A typical Wodehouse Novel, and one of his early works","Since ""A Damsel in distress"" was one of P.G. Wodehouse's earlier works, the plot and the twists are recurring in many of his later works. I didn't enjoy this as much as his later novels, but I would think this would be a very good introduction to someone new to reading P.G. Wodehouse's style of writing.I am glad that this along with other books by P.G. Wodehouse are available for free for the Kindle. I remember reading his works during my high school days in New Delhi, India, borrowing them every month from the local British Council Library. Reading ""A Damsel in distress"" took me back to those days. Looking forward to reading more of the collection especially over the Kindle.This is the second book that I have read over my recently acquired kindle, I don't think I am going back to paper back or hard cover books again."
2,Poor Quality Ebook,The pagination is awful. Paragraphs are routinely divided into two. I read it using the Kindle for Android app. Don't know if that might have been a factor or not. The price is right.
1,what is to like?,"Considering that the 18th century is vastly different than our own, this book was a wasted opportunity to show the differences. How would a 20th or 21st centry miss cope with things such a chamber pot, foods, how about deodorant and tooth paste! One would think the Emily/Candace grew up with none of these things! What a silly book where no one is especially interesting."
4,Nice time travel romance,"I am a huge fan of time travel romance, and a very picky one at that. I especially enjoy regency era time travel romance from present to past. Although I did enjoy this book immensly, I must warn anyone thinking of buying it. The story was a little hard to keep straight and the ending seemed to be hurridley wrapped up. Also (SPOILER ALTER)the main character seemed all too eager to give up her love without a fight because she loved him. It barely even touched on how that may have been a difficult desicion for her! Despite those fact, the rest was an enjoyable read, but it definetly could have used a few more love scenes!!! Wheres the passion!?"
3,Not My Favorite,I love Ben Tankard but this was not my favorite CD. There are great songs on it but I'm not happy with it as much as others. I would not start with this CD. Play Me In Your Key has been my favorite.
1,Outdated book about Gen X'ers,"This book was extremely short, and from the perspective of a ""gen x-er"" which is no longer the person who is turning 30. In this day and age women of 30 face a very different set of issues and stresses and this book does not address those. I don't think I got any take-aways from this book except the fact that I wasted my money. Still haven't found any good alternative books, but have passed the big milestone b-day and am talking all the anxieties out with my peers who are the same age and my husband who is very understanding. Skip the book."
5,Great book worth the money,There are plenty of clear examples of CF coding in this book to help the novice and more advanced users of ColdFusion. Clearly written as good as the Forta books.
5,The most valuable book in my ColdFusion library!,"This book is great. I use it to bring new developers up to speed with ColdFusion as well as a personal reference for my own coding needs. The chapters flow well, and are very detailed. The code samples are very handy, and the reference guide is second to none. O'Reilly has done it again!If you only own 1 ColdFusion book, this should be it!"
5,Great reference material,"I love O'Reilly books. I'm never disappointed with them. I just got my copy of Programming ColdFusion yesterday and absolutely love this book! The function and tag references are worth their weight in gold. This is absolutely the best reference I have seen so far. I haven' had a chance to read the rest of the book yet, but if it is as good as the references, I know it is going to be good."
1,Very bad book,"This is a not well-researched book. Many miscaptioned photos and inaccurate historical ""facts"". I do not recommend it.There are better sources of information. I recommend the following:""The Fokker Triplane"" by Alex Imrie.""Fokker Dr.I. Aces of World War One"" by Franks, Van Wyngarden""The Red Air Fighter"" by Manfred von Richthofen""Richthofen"" by A.E. Ferko""Richthofen: Beyond the Legend of the Red Baron"" by Peter Kilduff""Who Killed the Red Baron"" by P J Carisella and J W Ryan""The Red Baron's Last Flight"" by Norman Franks and A Bennet"
2,No color choice,"I rated this only two stars because you cannot choose the color. Otherwise I would have given 4 stars (because in one roll there were 2 defects). I had sent an email to the supplier asking for black cord, but never got any reply back. The color that came was Yellow. If color is important to you, look around, there are other providers."
2,wwe theme addict,"1.evolution -this song is ok but im not a fan of motorhead2.carlito-i dont like this song at all3.teddy long-i never really listen to the whole song4.christian-ok, but,i think it could be better5.heidenreich-this song stinks,but its one of the best on the cd6.raw diva search-was this made in the 70's?7.chavo-i never listen to this song anymore8.undertaker-the non-remix song is better9.eugene-perfect for eugene10.victoria-i dont reallylike this one it always gets stuck in my head11.shelton benjamin-this song is pretty good12.billy kidman-like the song,hate the superstar13.smackdown-smackdown should keep this eventho raws theme is better14.gail kim-whats the point of this song?15.jbl-dont like it ,the mooing at the beggining has to go16.john cena-my favorite song on the cd and my favorite super star in the wwei only give it two stars for the extra dvd"
2,why?,"You are better just getting the other Vandals albums because these songs are good. Some of these songs on this album are acceptable or just bad. And the only futured remixes are mostly on I.D.S.S. except for four on their newest album. They could have remixed other songs for other albums and that might have been better. The only positive thing about the album is the bonus track. The bonus track is a weird mix of at least 40 different Vandals songs over about 6 minutes or so. It is amazing, but not quite worth the price because you'd have to buy the rest of the album too."
2,For the MAC only?,"O.k. So the device worked great paired with my Nokia 3650 phone. But.. where it lacked greatly was trying to do ANYTHING with my Tungsten T. (I guess they just don't like Palm devices) I searched for new drivers etc. and was very disappointed to find that I couldn't hotsync or do much of anything with my Tungsten T and this junk device.So, not to be too negative (I'm sure it works fine with most phones and Mac's) but if it doesn't work with a bluetooth compatible device like my Tungsten T.. what's the point?"
2,ummm,"I give it two stars because it worked very well right out of the box, installed really well everything.... But when I tried to transfer files from my Tungsten T2, it wouldn't let me...I'm sending it back because I got it for that reason, so I didn't have to be locked up on the computer all day, I could go anywhere in my house and work on my palm, but because I can't get it to transfer files, it's of no use..."
1,Poor installation and nonexistent customer support,"I attempted to install this unit on two different Windowss XP laptop computers and have been unsuccessful in both cases.Case 1 - The driver would not allow the device to be loaded by Windows.Case 2 - Installation went fine, got an error stating that the software license does not support this Bluetooth device whenever I tried to open the software.In both cases I downloaded the updated drivers and documentation, but with no success.These devices may be OK for Macintosh systems, but they are useless for WinXP.This is my second strike for Belkin, and I will not be purchasing any more products from them. Belkin made good quality products a few years back, but those days appear to be gone."
2,Disappointing...,"I couldn't wait to get my adapter, but ended up having to send it back because of all the problems. I'm not sure if I just had lemon or what, but once my Nokia 3650 and Sony T610 were paired (no problems there) I couldn't get any more communication between the devices. I tried this on two different computers, tried Belkin customer service (STILL haven't heard from them!), and finally, in my last ditch effort, looked up anything I could find on the net for help. All to no avail. I just don't have that much time to waste on this! What a disappointment!"
1,Does not work with Win XP Pro,"This is the 2nd Belkin product I have had the misfortune of buying and after 2 hours I cannot get it to work on my laptop with Win XP Pro. The messages differ from the guide. At the HW level, the machine recognizes the device but the Belkin software does not! Do not buy this product if you have XP."
3,Happy Fathers Day,"Purchased this with my mom and sister for my dad through VenTribe.com, great value thanks to us being able to split it. Got this a year ago and he still loves it. Simple, sophisticated and functional."
5,I effing love this album!,"I wasn't sure whether I'd like this album or not, considering the reviews. And coming into it, yes.. it's very strange. But the songs have such meaning. You can tell Eurythmics were going through something deep, and it shows. The music sounds so melancholy, and yet, so beautiful. The songs are amazing. Every single one tells a story and uses Annies voice to it's full potential. I love the video album, too. This is my favorite Eurythmics release. It's so perfect. Give it a shot, but know it might take a few listens to get into it. Highly recommend!"
3,Eurythmics without the sparkle,"What I like most about Eurythmics is the way they play with submelodies through the main melody of their songs. In this album they undressed their music. It is simple, sometimes bombastic but not at all suprising. That this would be their last album for a long time did not suprise me at all. In Peace the ""old"" Eurythmics has arisen from the dust. Savage is nice to complete your collection. Nothing more."
2,Horrible.,"""Savage"" was the album that put me off Eurythmics for a long time until a friend convinced me that ""We Too Are One"" wasn't nearly as bad. Yes, they're back to their electronica but it's nowhere near as interesting as it used to be. ""She was a wide eyed girl in a purple dress, she coulda been good, she coulda been the best""? ""I've got a lover back in Japan, he's got tattoos, he's my Superman""? It sounds like Annie lowered her IQ points by about 90 to come up with the lyrics to some of this drivel. The production is boring, too. The three better songs on here are ""You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart"" which has a good electronic backbeat coupled with some nice vocalese, ""Savage"", the definitive Annie ""ice queen"" performance, and the capper ""Brand New Day"" which, at the end of it all, proves that Annie can send shivers down your spine just singing A CAPELLA. Other than that I'd like to forget this album ever happened."
5,"The ""Concept Album"" that's still fresh","This cd never got the respect it deserved when it came out. Maybe it was the times, who knows. Maybe it was that a certain video station goofed up and ran the video for ""I Need a Man"" when the band initially released ""Beethoven."" They went for an album with a theme, generally linking all the songs--the icy feeling of love-as-leftover and not knowing where to go. The cd is brilliant, for my money--it takes chances that have only become apparent to me now. Their best, I think. Catch the entire album on video, which tells a story, indeed, song by song."
3,"Good,def. experimental!","I heard some negative reviews about this cd, so I was initally turned off by it, but decided to give it a chance. I thought it was good, but compared to Annie Lennox/Eurythmics other work. This cd seems to fall alittle flat. It's def. an expermental album for them(you can kind of tell by the 1st track, Bethoveen). I wasn't a huge fan of that one. Although, i did love the Japanese lover track. That song had a nice hook, and great beats to it. Classic Eurythmics style! Very good! There were a few other tracks that seemed to incorparate the whole rockabilly sound(which is something i love!) into their music. Overall, i'd most of the tracks were strong,but there were different. This is def. a different direction for them. If anybody loves 80's music or the eurythmics then def. check this album out!"
1,prehistoric outdated and useless,"this is a 30 year old machine with a 30 year old design which is cheap. Most importantly, The bottom piece (drip tray) just slips out and does not stay put. There is nothing really to hold it and It is so cheaply constructed. I hate the way you need to pull parts off before you can access the water tank It is too bad that it was purchased from Aabree coffee aka whole latte love instead of Amazon or macy's because they are not a friendly company as they impose an undesclosed restocking fee at their own convenience (that's right, they will surprise you in three months with your credit amount reflecting a restocking fee varying from 15-50%) yeah, there are great reviews for this machine but they are as ancient as this machine. if you want this machine, might as well get it from a garage sale or craigs list. As for me, I prefer something that wasn't on my grandmothers counter. anyone who defends this machine is trying to make a sale. plain and simple"
3,Change the coffee holder spouts design,"Messy, it splashes coffee out both sides of the spouts. Change the design so coffee come straight down like my old Barista does."
3,A Real Review,"I have owned this machine for 3 years. It makes a great espresso but it has a giant flaw which I am hoping I can fix. The espresso basket holes are soo fine it constantly clogs-up and is very difficult to clean. I am very unhappy I cannot use ILLY ground coffee because it is too finely ground for this basket, single or double. I spend more damn time trying to keep the basket clean enough for use I just stopped using the machine. Before this machine I used a Krupps 40.00 espresso machine and my ILLY espresso's were great, too bad I can't enjoy this machine. I am in search of a basket that will fit the machine with larger holes so I can actually use the 400.00 counter ornament. Steer clear of this machine.Mike"
1,Gaggia failed --no recourse-no company help,I purchased a Gaggia classic less then 4 months ago. It made reasonable coffee for a while. Then it stopped. I could not locate the company to repair it nor to let me know who is behind their machine for repairs.I had to spend $150.00 to have it repaired locally. No factory warranty or help.Would not recommend the machine unless you want to spend a great deal of your money to keep it going. No company help whatsoever.
1,xmas gift,This machine is a total waste of money. I got it for CHristmas and after a month (right after the Amazon 30 days) it started spitting espresso out the sides when I brew two shots. I have tried tamping down the coffee and changing the grind and nothing makes a difference. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this item. You can't even call Amazon for help there is no phone mumber. What a disappointment.
1,Awful machine,"This is the worst espresso machine I've ever owned/used. I've owned 3 machines prior and used countless others. I read somewhere that with this machine ""you have to get the grind right."" Duh! For this machine, however, no grind seems to be right. If your grind is even slightly too coarse, you get a watery shot; too fine a grind and the machine won't even produce a shot! Nothing happens! The machine just backs up. I've ground the coffee myself and tried multiple grinds from multiple coffee shops/vendors. Let me put it this way: When this machine works well I'm absolutely stunned! Like the other reviewers I did my research. That's why I'm so disappointed. Don't buy this machine. No stars."
5,Good as it gets,"To make real italian caffè, one would need a professional machine, retailing at around 5 grand (the cheaper ones - some go up to staggering 20 thousand dollars). Besides the somewhat restrictive price, these machines need about half an hour to heat up, consume an obscene amount of electricity and demand constant maintenance. But, of course, the coffee's unbelievable.The Gaggia Classic is the next best thing. This is, by far, the best home espresso machine you can get. Efficient and fast boiler, large water compartment, powerful pump. It's also easy to set up, easy to use, and easy to clean. It makes almost perfect espresso, and the frother is also very decent. And, as a bonus, the thing lasts forever. It is a bit pricey, but worth every penny."
4,Long time user,"I bought my Gaggia classic in 2004 from wholelattelove. It took a while to dial it in, weeks maybe, but I have been very happy over all. I can agree with steaming complaints but with practice I now get excellent microfoam. I spilled coffee into the top and shorted out the lights in the switches. After about 2 years the steam valve started leaking. I found a new one online and ordered it, along with a new switch panel. Both were relatively inexpensive and easy to replace. I have since replaced the steam valve a second time. If you turn it off too firmly you will ruin it. We also got the gaggia burr grinder. We use PEETS espresso forte. We use the machine every day for at least two lattes, and have for a little over 7 years now. I would probably buy the same machine again. In response to another review I read, I have found Wholelattelove customer service to be excellent."
3,"Nice machine, bad frother","Beautiful machine, makes a great expresso but I'm very upset about the turbo frother attachment. I've tried to froth milk 6 times and every single time, no matter how hard I slip the attachment up at the tube it slides down during frothing creating a huge spilling mess. It's unbelievable that the designers of this machine couldn't come up with something that works and stays in place to withstand the steam pressure.If you ony drink expressos buy this machine but if you love cappucinos and lattes don't bother with this one."
3,Nice Espresso Machine with a few flaws,I have had the classic for about 4 months. It replaced a Gaggia Carezza that made good esperesso but had a weak steam chamber that made steaming milk an major exercise. The best part of the machine is the quality of the brew group like all Gaggia products. The pump system works well and you can pull very good shots. The suck back valve is problematic and doesn't work so well but isn't needed either. As so many people have noted the frother is pretty cheesy and will wear out after a while. They are cheap to replace and I keep one around the house for repairs/losing it down the dispos-all. The machine builds up steam nicely and will heat a 20 oz pitcher to 140F in about 1 minute with good steam pressure the entire timeThe only other minus that I see is that the valves are hard to get at to clean and I'm not sure what I will do when they start to leak. I haven't been able to figure out how to get at them yet
3,Buy the Rancilio Silvia instead,"I was able to test this machine at Peet's (great customer service, I would have bought from them if I had wanted it). I worked as a barrista in college and I know how to make excellent espresso drinks, having made thousands. However, there was not sufficient pressure to make a single proper cappuccino. Reading the reviews of the Rancilio Silvia, I bought it instead without a test drive and was pleased how much better it works. It will make a real espresso (I like Lavazza Qualita Oro's grind, which is slightly courser than Illy's), and put good foam on enough milk for two lattes. It far outperforms the Gaggia Classic, for only a small amount more."
4,Close to perfect,The Gaggia classic makes an espresso where the crema which is a delightful mahogany color and an amazing aroma. So technically that machine is just about perfect. The only issue is the frother. The turbo frother is too long for a 12 ounce frothing pitcher. Meaning you spill the milk when you try to remove it from the machine. Another option is to raise the entire machine. Otherwise the machine is a great value compared to the Rancilio Silvia adn others in the 400-500 range.
4,Gaggia 14101,I like the simple use and quality of the machine. Only used it for a week. Hope it holds up to years of use.
2,Broken in a little over a year,"This item made decent coffee for the first nine months, or so. After that, it began pumping slowly and inconsistently. Now, at just over a year after purchase, it's completely broken. We have descaled, and use R.O. filtered water in the machine. I beleive the pump is weak and has broken. Repairs are not easy to figure out, either. I wanted a true espresso machine, but now I regret not getting a Nespresso--my inlaws have one and it makes delicious coffee without any of these issues. So much for being a purist."
2,"Great Espresso, but!","The ""Classic"" got good customer reviews and I agree with...""it makes great Espresso"". I have had two of the ""Classic"" in the past month and both have had the pump fail. Although, Amazon is outstanding on the returns and refunds, I have twice learned. I have confidence in Amazon, but forget the Gaggai 14101 Classsic."
2,Sour Espresso shots from beginning to end.,"I'm an espresso drinker looking for a machine to brew a good tasting espresso. I started with a DeLonghiEC155 entry level espresso machine, with poor results. Then I bought the Gaggia Classic. All the shotswere sour. I tried everything recommended by several people on the Gaggia forum. Temperature surfing,better beans, roasting my own beans, adjusting the boiler pressure, darker roasts. Since I couldn't drink the espresso, I did start making cappuccinos, which this machine can do.Putting lots of sugar in the drink offsets the sour coffee taste. Not what I wanted, so I returned the machine. (Kudos to Amazon for their liberal return policy!) Wondering what to buy next to get that heavenly shot of espresso in the morning?"
1,Arrived inoperable,"Unit arrived and pump didn't operate. Unit was packed in an outer box barely larger than the unit's box, with a few of those air things thrown in so it's no surprise that the unit didn't work. And then Amazon forced me to pay $6 postage to return the separate tamper which I purchased but now no longer need since I'm returning the espresso machine. Thanks, that's what I get for spending typically $2,000 a year as a faithful Amazon customer. Suggest that people not order delicate Italian machinery mail order from Amazon but rather why not try that bed and bath retailer so that at least you can return a defective unit to their local store."
4,new design a little too much,"I owned an old classic (romanza) for years. Great value, but it became more diffiicult to maintain after 14 years. This new design incorporates changes on the steam wand that it is not necessarily better, maybe easier to use for the occasional barista type, but it is more difficult to insert and remove for cleaning. The switches are not quite that logical as before, the quality of the machine seems very good. Price was great at the time. I love the 1475 watts since it determines how the machine keeps up with the water and steam production."
2,total disappointment,"I am so disappointed in my Gaggia. For a few months it worked fantastically (after I threw away the stupid frother that made ""dish suds""). Now it is leaking water from the pump and is getting super hot-- the water is boiling. So it looks like the thermostat is broken as well. This sucks. I never had problems like this with my Saecco which worked forever. Even though there is a warranty, which I will take advantage of, it will be a lot of work to ship it off to the other coast and I won't have the machine for a while. I have read that the leaky pump is a common problem with Gaggias when they go bad. I only had this machine for 4 months."
2,"Good espresso, not durable","Have had for one year, four months. Just went to make espresso and water started leaking out of all seams in the power head. Called Gaggia support in the US (Importika), and was informed that I have to send it in for repair. It's incredibly disappointing that the machine only lasted four months beyond the warranty period before it needs an expensive repair."
2,Unnecessarily cruel,"I had read the book Black Thorn White rose before picking up this anthology and had a lot of hopes for this book. I love the retelling of fairy tales even with a dark twist to them. However, some of the stories in this book are absolutely horrific. The Match Girl, in my opinion, does not belong in a collection of fantasy but instead perhaps in one of horror. Its been a week since I read this book and I still have a bad taste left from it!"
4,Retellings,A great short stories of Fairy Tales for adults.Wonderfully intertaning and an enlighting read.
4,Better then Black Thorn...,"This is the third book released from these editors. I truly adored the first one, particuarly the story from Neil Gaiman (who wasn't very popular at the time). I thought that the second book was weak, but this book definitly makes up for what the last one lacks. If you loved fairytales as a child, you should try the fairy tales that are for a more mature level."
3,Good but not perfect.,"Length:: 1:19 MinsProsMany ways to attach flasher to clothing etc.Screw down design means no accidental activation.Good battery lifePelican Legendary Lifetime GuaranteeNon-replaceable bulb is covered by pelican products warranty, if it breaks just send it back to pelican for a replacementCoin batteries used May be able to be found at your local 'dollar store'.ConsThe lens can sometimes be hard to turn (especially when cold) to activate the light."
2,Tough enclosure but weak light and already malfunctioning,"It's dim and has already stopped flashing in only 2 uses. It does come on steady still, but does not offer the safety I purchased it for."
2,Not very bright,Perhaps the batteries in the new units are depleted but the brightness is poor as delivered.I will lube the threads with a little vaseline and get new batteries.
1,Pathetic little light,"This thing sucks. It's not very bright, it's tiny, and I really don't see much use for it. I would not expect for it to help aid in the saving of my life. So...find something bigger if you're worried about getting hit by a car, or boat, or whatever..."
4,Really great TV for the price,This television has a great picture and very ample viewing area for its size. It is reasonably priced and remote has as much control as you could possibly want. The channels all come in clear and vivid even on standard television reception. A highly recommended product.
2,Disappointing,"I frequently read romance novels and picked up this one because the story seemed intriguing. Unfortunately, the high points of this book(the discussion of her dresses and the three sex scenes), did not make up for the lack of continuity in character development and plot. It seemed as though Palmer contradicted herself on nearly every other page which made the book both confusing and annoying to read. In addition, the male lead spent nearly the entire book in love with another woman and was not likable in the least. I skimmed the last 100 pages because I simply couldn't take the shoddy writing. What a waste of $14."
5,One of my favorites,This is one of my favorite Diana Palmer reads. I loved the setting of Atlanta & the mystery woven through the romance. I love the strong willed characters & the way it all fit together. Diana really outdid herself with this one.
3,Magnolia.......an almost enticing romance novel,"Magnolia by Diana Palmer was almost an enticing romance novel. Claire was by far the most interesting character. She drove and repaired her Oldsmobile motorcar, which she inherited from her uncle. She became a sought-after fashion designer and developed many friendships with the well-to-do.She married John Hawthorn, who was in love with a married woman named Diane. The marriage between John and Claire was one of convenience. John, in my opinion, was a boring wishy washy type of character. Why an adult man would feel that he was betraying Diane by having affection for his own wife was weird. He was a graduate of the Citadel and Harvard and was considered to be brilliant....no personality, just brilliant.Magnolia was a nice read."
2,unremarkable,"Very glad that I rented this book from the library instead of buying. The heroine is cute, but the ""hero"" -John- is difficult to like. The storyline is tired and in places, unbelievable. Can't recommend."
5,OH MY GOD IT'S BEAUTIFUL!!!!,I think it is a beautiful album filled with good wholesome songs from the old days and I'm only 26..well almost!
2,written review,it is really good no sracthes playes greatWow Gospel 1998: The Year's 30 Top Gospel Artists And Songs
5,WOW 1998 - awesome arrangment of praise&worship 1998 is #1,"WOW 1998 is a powerful and a awesome arrangement of praise and worship music. To me it is the best one to date. It was the first one I ever purchased and I've bought them every year since and none has touched me the way that this one has. I lent it to a non believer at work she loved it and she never returned it so I have looked alot of places I;m happy to have found it here.It's a great way to sample an artist's music before you purchase a whole CD,Comes highly recommended will definately enhance your relationship and walk with the Lord. You'll learn appreciate him more."
4,Great.......... A Real Blessing,"This album is i think one of the best in the WOW Gospel Series. Songs like ""I Got a Testimony"" and ""Be Encouraged"" are a blessing, and uplifting. ""Order My Steps"" and ""The Battle is The Lords"" are powerful. ""Total Praise"" by Richard Smallwood, words can not express how much this song speaks to my soul. This album is a must have in the series."
1,Stink,"This record stinks to high-heaven.First of all, it's not very good. There's a little bit of guitar on the first cut. Mick Ronson must have died somewhere later. Promising, but never fulfilled ... and yeah, I realy like Lou Reed.The only redeeming feature is his reference to the colored girls in the chorous of ""Walk on the Wild Side"".This record goes in my trash bin."
4,TRANSFORMERS ARE MEN WHO CAN BECOME MACHINES,"This is a funky laid-back album that never lived up to the potential it's hit single, ""Walk on the Wild Side"" suggests. The other songs are folkie rockers and Harry Nielson-like sleepers that never get very wild. Still, if Lou Reed wants to dig a ditch and wallow in it, I'll listen."
4,unbelievable,"after looking at the track listing i thought this album was Lou Reed's greatest hits.. . it might as well be. every song is gold, but what else would you expect when bowie and lou reed get together"
4,Still some of the most essential Reed...,"In the midst of the roaring glam craze of the early seventies, Mick Ronson & Bowie, as you probably read above, single handedly resusitated Reed's slow-to-start solo career with this glib, often times shallow effort. Obviously its not without its charms, however, and who better than Mr. 'Venus In Furs' himself to chronicle the exploits of the grotesque parade of transvestites, hustlers, hookers, and other unsavory individuals, as vivid in depiction as an F. Scott Fitgerald novel set to music. Thankfully, Reed didn't crank out this same kind of crap endlessly in the seventies, however, instead producing the mordant 'Berlin' awash in a sea of apathy, drugs & divorce, after this one, which I prefer slightly."
4,Lou Reed for the masses,"This is the closet Lou Reed got to the mainstream. With the help of David Bowie, Lou Reed made ""Transformer,"" a seventies pop classic. It isn't as great as ""Berlin"" and ""Rock 'N' Roll Animal"" but it doesn't even come close to one of Lou Reed's many crimes against humanity(""New York,"" ""The Bells,"" etc.) ""Transformer"" is simply good pop with the Velvet Underground underground New York scene lyrics. Lots of people will remember such hits as ""Perfect Day, ""Walk On The Wild Side,"" and ""Satellite Of Love"" which indeed are the best offerings on this album. The rest are good but not as well perfected. ""Transformer"" is great but not Lou Reed's best, it's just his most popular for obvious reasons. Check out ""Berlin"" if you want to see the REAL Lou Reed."
5,looooooouu,"Wow your in your room you have nothing to do and then you decide to put on Transformer. Boom, Next thing you know your wisked away to a place where ugliness can be beautiful and peace at heart comes by trial by fire. Lou's music may be dark and scary sometimes but there is always a light at the end of the tunnel and it's always a joy to travel with him there."
3,"a bit dated, actually","This is the famous album where Bowie rescues Lou Reed's career and turns him into glam, right? Well, mabye. The good songs here, ""Vicious"", ""Andy's Chest"", ""Perfect Day"", Walk on the Wild Side"", and ""Satellite of Love"" were really great, but 2 of them were just new versions of Velvet songs. The album stands today as a pale and emaciated whole, but who can't love those few songs, where Lou Reed breaks through the typical solo post-band drudgery to deliver glam rock like no other. The quintessential glam ballads ""Perfect Day"" and ""Walk on the Wild Side"" are as meaningful now as they ever were, and Mick Ronson's guitar on ""Vicious"" is as vicious as it was in 1972. The album definitely can't stand up to the Velvet Underground's greatness, and comes off as self-parody most of the time, but is that a bad thing?"
4,"Overrated certainly, but...","Okay...""Walk on the Wild Side"" is a great song, even if it's a crime that it's so much better known than any other Lou Reed song. ""Satellite of Love"" is also great, and the deceptively happy ""Perfect Day"" is of his all-time greats, featuring the legendary line ""you made me forget myself/I thought I was someone else/someone good."" ""I'm So Free"" and ""Vicious"" are also great. Most of the other songs, though, while deserving credit historically for being so openly ""gay"" really aren't so great. For that reason, while I dig this one out often, I rarely listen to the whole thing. [...]"
4,Enjoyable after five months,"Lots of reviews for the CD, and I read about twenty of them. It seems one either likes ""Peace"" or is very disappointed. I've listened to the CD for around five months: I still find it one of their most enjoyable albums. Much of it is reflective, catchy, and melodious pop. Favorites have to be ""17 Again"", ""I've Tried Everything"" (the refrain ""Oooo, you're a loser now"" has a haunting, yet hummable pop quality to it), and the soulful/gospel tinged ""Lifted"". There are no flops here, but fans might be disappointed that there are no striking singles or quirky/stark/electronic twists to the music. Nonetheless, the music demonstrates how mature both members have become in their themes and arrangements. One hopes that their next album, and there will be a next album per Stewart, could be more adventuresome ala their earlier works, but ""Peace"" is still a wonderful addition to any Eurythmics fan's collection."
4,Never bought a Eurythmics CD until this...,"Wonderful stuff. I too first heard ""Saved the World Today"" on the Sopranos and was impressed (also ""I've tried everything"" is on the soundtrack).Peace was my first Eurythmics purchase. Before I heard clips from the album, I thought they were just another neo-boring band who I could never get into. Peace is so untypical of their past work. gilbertefarah@hotmail.com"
4,Mellow yet still strong reunion,"Right after seeing their 'I Saved The World Today' video, I immediately got myself a copy. The opening track 'Seventeen Again' mirrors their distinct reteaming. However their edgy performance for this CD, Eurythmics' power and audio capture became erstwhile mellow. Annie Lennox's voice is more subtle but still piercing. Her textured hit for the highnotes, coupled with Stewart's juxtaposed instrument blending, is apparently absent. Their melodies still stark, tempo still swingy and moody, lyrics remained cheeky and heartfelt bleedy. Peace is simply a concoction lacking a few fey ingredients and has now gotten into the median than our expected sanguine consistency of the musical bonding they once had in the 80s. However most of the tracks are hardly minor earcandies, and Annie Lennox and Dave Stewarts return, though a segue to the devitalized, is a successful return. This CD is still worth the wait."
4,Annie's third album,"Eurythmics-fans beware: Peace is in many ways Annie Lennox' third album. It is in the songs which set off her unique voice at its best, that this album really sparkles. The revivalist songs which apparently are supposed to make us remember songs like 'Would I lie to you?' just are not up to scratch. But ah.... the beauty of a wonderful, simple song like 'Seventeen Again', or 'I saved the world today'. After listening to this album for a whole week I am quite certain: it may be great that Eurythmics are back in business, but I would have preferred Annie to make another solo album. Oh well... perhaps in the new millennium. Her voice does seem to become even better with age, that's for sure."
3,NOT the original album,"For Eurythmics purists, beware that this re-mastered edition is not the same as the original issue of the album. About half of the tracks have been remixed and sound different than original. Notably, ""Power To The Meek"" does not include all of the lyrics (the same verse is repeated twice instead of there being two different verses) and ""I've Tried Everything"" is completely different. Minor variations exist on ""Peace Is Just A Word"", ""My True Love"", ""Forever"", and ""Lifted."" Long story short -- Don't sell your original CD just yet!"
4,A Strong and Poignant Dose of Eurythmics,"This album represents a strong showing from Eurythmics after their mainly melancholy ""We Too Are One,"" in 1989. While the sounds on ""Peace"" are more varied, from the uplifting, gospel-like ""Keep On Lifted,"" to the jazzy, noir ""I Saved The World Today,"" the themes are in the same vein as ""We Too Are One;"" loneliness and alienation, with a small dose of optimism. The title track, ""Peace"" represents one of the album's most poignant moments, while the bittersweet view of fame in the deliciously ironic ""Seventeen Again,"" will remind you of the wit and genius that makes Eurythmics' music so potent. This album will stir up dark emotions, like its predecessors ""Savage"" and ""We Too Are One,"" but it is sonically much closer to Annie Lennox's ""Diva,"" with warm synthesizers, harmonies and varied instrumentation to soften the heartrending lyrics. Peace is a must-buy for fans and non-fans alike."
3,"Glad you're back folks, but....","... but although there are some nice ballads, the album isn't worth buying, unless you are an Eurythnmics' fan like me. Hopefully this is just the beginning of a new great era, but the album is still very far from ""Touch"", ""Sweet Dreams"", ""Be yourself tonight"" and (why not?) Revenge. If don't know Eurythmics yet, don't begin with this CD.... but rather buy some old album."
4,They are back and better than ever...,"An example of how enduring talent can produce such incredible music, this ""return"" album by the popular duo from the 1980s shows us how compelling lyrics, melded with intricate, layered melodies makes pale many of today's top pop offerings. I bought this en route to a vacation in Mexico and could not stop listening to it the entire time. How lucky we are that the Eurythmics are back in business! I urge you to run not walk to your nearest computer and buy this on Amazon.com!"
2,Hello! Review proof-readers needed!,"I didn't particularly like this new Eurythmics CD, but Amazon and ""Jessica Jewel"" wake up! The previous (and overly lengthy) review is for the wrong artist."
2,What A Disappointment!,"Being a long time Eurthymics fan I was really looking forward to this reunion cd. What a disappointment that the slick, hip, cool, artsy duo of the 80's have turned to the ""grunge"" sound. Don't they know this ""sound"" is dead. They were usually ahead of the curve. But they have really messed up with this one. If ""Peace"" had come out in the early 90's it would make sense but this ""sound"" is tired. The first 4 or so songs are good the others, junk. The Eurthymics used to be cutting edge, now they are just like everyone else. Save you money and buy an old Eurthymics album. Savage is the best one."
1,One good song,"What a shame- one good song and the rest is b...The videos for the songs are just silly- two people, getting older, but their music died. No talent, no voice, all gone. Stay where you are-in bed."
1,mistake,"I have enjoyed Eurythmics from a distance in the past and decided to bite on this release - a mistake. Boring, redundant, unoriginal etc etc. I like Annie Lenox's voice - but it isnt strong enough to carry an entire CD. I really expected more from this duo in the way of musical creativity. Goes into my pile of ""never gonna listen to again"" CDs. Is there a CD scrapyard somewhere?"
2,not 2 bad,"this cd did not feature ""sweet dreams"" i bought this cd to listen to that song! at least it had i saved the world today"
2,"Evolution? Masterpiece? Reality check, please!","This sounds like the second half of ""We too are one""... mishmash of hit and miss (mostly miss) and the creative efforts of yore are gone.Is this their destiny, to become top 40, Easy-listening- Kasey Kasem fodder? Unimaginative, derivative, stuck in the middle, wailing about (and I quote) ""The bad thing""?Not worth it, and sad to say, an alarming shame for those that loved the original group... it's like it has been revamped as the Stepford Eurythmics.Now, I am ready to be immolated by all of those that ""just adored/loved"" this (way too expensive for what it was) album. I am sure the must be ""nice"" people."
1,Terrible,"As hard as I try I cannot find a good word to say about this sorry excuse for an album. The Eurythmics were never a great band and Annie's constant wailing was always looked upon with some humour(a singer who thought she had a great voice, but nobody would tell her the truth). I honestly thought after several lean years maybe things would have improved, but no, still the same wailing out-of-tune voice and still the same silly songs. It's back to packing groceries at Wal-Mart Annie. Bad luck, must try harder."
4,A little mellow (and melodramatic) - but it grows on you,"When I first bought this album I found it a little depressing. It may have been my mood, or maybe it's the melodramatic lyrics. Anyway, I got over that pretty quickly when I realy listened to the the lovely ""Saved The World Today"", or the rocker ""I Want It All"". Then I noticed other standout tracks like the spare and beautiful ""My True Love"" which showcases Annie's vocals best on the album, and ""Power To The Meek"" reminded me a little of the duo around their ""Missionary Man"" days. And if the slower tracks leave you a little downtrodden, they do at least leave you on thier last cut with the subltle and pretty ""Lifted"" - a song about just hanging in there.So, no, this is not my favorite album from Dave & Annie (I have all of them), but it is a satisfying update to some of their classic work, so I gave it four stars. My favorite albums are still ""Touch"" and ""Sweet Dreams"", but this is a nice addition to my collection."
4,great get together......,"A reunion album from one of rock's most influential duo, the Eurythmics. The idea for them to do an album after ten yeas stemmed from a very successful collaboration at this year's BRIT awards. And the outcome: an album that jives and rocks by all means. The opening cut 17 AGAIN reminds you that the Eurythmics are back and hails a few lines from the chorus of their hit song SWEET DREAMS. The first released single, I Saved The World Today, is a bonafide hit with Lennox's beautiful voice and Dave Stewart's fabulous songwriting at the helm. Other notable tracks include the rocking I Want It All, the poigant ballad My True Love and I've Tried Everything. A welcoming get-together"
2,Not worthy of Annie's time and talent.,"No matter what anyone says, ""Peace"" does not come close to the ingenuity of Annie Lennox's solo recordings OR the previous Eurythmics incarnation. Why this magnificent singer (and yes, actress) would want to follow-up ""Diva"" and ""Medusa"" AND her female vocalist Grammy with this tepid collection is beyond me. Is she tired of going it alone already? Annie, please don't make us wait another five years for your next CD. Call Stephen Lipsom ASAP."
1,This is not the Eurythmics that I know.,I love the Eurythmics but this CD could be a totally different band. It does not have any good hard driving dance type rhythms. I am sadly disappointed in this CD and if you think it will sound like their former albums you will be too. Contrary to one reviewer the former albums sounded great when Dave joined in which he does not in this album. Buy an older CD.
3,Reunion album falls short,"This album was supposed to be their big comeback, reuniting once again. Unfortunatley, most songs are sad and depressing. Stick to older albums and her solo stuff."
4,Never a disappointment! A must for Eurythmic fans!,"Though there is nothing that really jumps out and grabs you as you put the CD into the player, Peace is a Cd that will not leave your machine for days! 17 Again is a smart look at the band's past history and perhaps future, including the 'sweet dreams' refrain at the end. The title track is a haunting premonition to what we as a society have or may yet become. Lennox vocals soar as always and though the music is more relaxed and sometimes Beatle-esque than previous discs, there is nothing that will disappoint a real Eurythmics fan. The only complaint would be that the disc is much too short for an absense so long."
4,Nice to have them back again,"Apparently, reviewer Ricky Wright must have been asleep in the earlier part of the decade when Annie Lennox released two very successful solo albums ""Diva"" and ""Medusa."" She racked up hit singles and scads of awards. His comment that her solo career had been ""less than dazzling"" is rather unkind, not to mention ill-informed. As for the new Eurythmics album, its pretty darn good. Not as good as their heyday, but I won't complain. ""I Saved The World Today"" is catchy as hell and Annie still knows how to belt out some tunes. Welcome back guys."
3,Loses 2 stars for omitting the remixes of 17 Again!!!,"While no singles made it to the radio airwaves, ""17 again"" became a HUGE club hit because of the Peter Rauhofer and Thunderpuss 12"" mixes that were only released as promos. They SHOULD have been on here!!!!"
1,mediocre adult contemporary,"Ok...maybe I am just getting old myself, but I listen to this album and I get sleepy. Annie's voice is always great, but there is no real energy on this album. Yes, bands change etc..but just because you change doesn't mean you have to get stale. The beauty in The Eurythmics was their blend of the aesthetics of New Wave with the soulfulness of R & B. Most of the older Eurythmics albums had a ""concept"", from the soundtrack to 1984, to Savage, this album just lingers, with no direction; just dull."
3,a tough one...,"i hate writing this, but this cd just didn't cut it for me. i wanted to like it. i really, really did. (for all of you unknowing out there, i'm annie's biggest fan!)but this was just a mediocre album from them. sure, some of the tracks were strong and had me humming, but for the most part, it is a mediocre album from this incredibly talented band.i've listened to it lately, to see if i just had unrealistically high expectations, but same result. eh. see them live. go listen to diva. revist their older stuff (particularly savage or touch). buy this one in the hopes that the sales will help them decide to put out another, better disc in the near future..."
2,Where did the music tuneship go?,"A talented duo still but the direction of their public's taste is not met here...ok, artists can do what they want, but we like to sing along with you, not here."
1,Should be 'Piece' as in 'This Record is a Piece of ....',"I'm simply stunned. The excellent songwriting - gone. The supreme tunesmithing - gone. Annie's vocal power - missing. This records is a tremendous disapointment. After such a long silence, it feels like they put this together in about a day."
1,Sad Attempt At Brining Back Past Glories,"This album never really was expected to be good, at best the Eurythmics were always a bit of a novelty act. Nothings changed it seems."
2,Very disappointed...,"This reissue could have been so much more. Firstly, the versions of several of these songs are markedly different from the original album, especially ""I've Tried Everything."" If they wanted to remix these songs, they should have just used them as bonus tracks! And the original album artwork is not here (the back shot of David Stewart is missing), as are the lyrics. And finally...these bonus tracks suck!!! They should have definately included the dance mix of 17 Again, which, here in the U.S., was the only hit version of that song!!! What a drag."
2,Peace not so good.,"Compared to Annie's solo efforts, which were excellent, this CD is not great. Now we know why only half the songs on any given Eurythmics album were good."
2,Where oh where has Diva gone?,"First, I'm a huge fan and will always have immense respect for Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart. I will forever be sentimental about their music that provided me with a soundtrack to my college years and beyond. ""Peace"" is here and after repeated listens and really wanting to like this cd, I have no idea why. It's not that is a bad cd, there is just absolutely no new ground covered here. In fact most of the vocal and musical arrangements are stale and uninspired. It seemed that Annie Lennox was on a clear trajectory to redefine herself as a solo artist with a new and promising vision on the enormously successful ""Diva"" and to a lesser extent with ""Medusa."" Lennoxs' solo concerts were awe inspiring. Where did all the promise go?"
3,Saved the World Today is fantastic,"I love the CD single of Saved the World today, with two versions of the song, one being what sounds like the demo. It's a fantastic song, proven by the demo version which is just annie and guitar. The rest of the album is good. Not great, but if you're a Eurythmics fan, it'll be good to have some new music from them."
1,"Yawn, zzzzzz.","My suspicion is that Dave's bringing Annie down. This album drones on, nothing spectacular or entertaining about this disk. Save your $$$$ or go get Medusa by Annie Lennox--which is a fabulous cd."
3,Ho Hum...,"I do love the Eurythmics but I have to be honest here... I haven't been this disappointed since my parents bought me a bible instead of a Nintendo for Christmas back in 1989. I was really looking forward to a new electrified album from my favorite ""edgy"" 1980's pop duo, but this is 80% boring and bland. While Annie's voice is still beautiful and touching, this album seems to go nowhere. If their reunion doesn't produce something more exciting than this, Annie should focus on her solo career again."
1,"Missing: Soul, feeling, intensity, originality","I have long been a fan of the Eurythmics and Annie solo. I have overlooked and forgiven them their less than spectacular cuts on some of their later albums such as Missionary Man and other uninspired efforts. I loved their first three albums-Annies' blue-eyed soul and fantastic vocal range were always high-lighted. How anyone can compare this pablum to their past successes amazes me. Be thrilled with mediocrity and that's what you'll get. I expect much more from Dave and Annie. Sadly, a missed opportunity for them to do something great."
5,17 Again -- Record of the Year,"If ""17 Again"" does not win Record of the Year, then there truly is no justice in the world. An absolutely brilliant song and when those ""sweet dreams"" riffs come in, you will spin out towards heaven."
5,A Masterpiece from 20+ Years Experience,"Don't expect 80's Eurythmics on this one. AND YOU SHOULDN'T WANT TO! With Dave and Annie going off to blossom separately, they have been able to come back together to make ""Peace"" for the rest of us. ""Forever"" is my favorite song, a Beatles/Oasis type song. ""17 Again"" really drives it home for me. The songs are about power, hope, and joy . . . with Lennox's rich vocals and Stewart's creative arrangements. Sit back and get some ""Peace"" into your life."
1,Are you guys kidding me?,The cost of this replacement filter with shipping and handling included is almost as much as the wet/dry vac originally cost!
1,disappointment,"After I saw the 5 star review I thought this was going to be a great set and 100.00 is no small change for flatware, when you can get good sets at walmart for 19.00 dollars, so i bought 2 sets of this the first set was missing all the spoons table and teaspoons and had double the amount of knives the second set was an apparant return with all the flat ware unwrapped and throwm into one box clanging together through transport not wrapped properly and scratched , the weight of this flatware was not top quality not heavy guage it was maybe 2.00 guage , not worth the 100 dollars i paid, i sent it back and hope now i get my refund in a timely manner,Amazon needs to check these flatwre sets before shipping them or they are going to lose me as a customer."
4,A Great Grab Bag Of Superman Stories,"This is a wonderful collection of misc. Superman stories. As a die hard Superman fan and a serious collector of superman comics, I am familiar with MANY Superman stories. These are definately very good ones. The best one is definately ""Excerpt From The Diary Of Dr. Morris Funkelstein"" by Mike Resnick. It tells the story of Clark Kent attempting to enlist in the military to fight the Nazis. If you are a fan of Superman stories these should be added to your collection."
2,Sorry collection of stories,"Most of the stories in this book offers little or no insight into the character of Superman. In fact very few of the authors display more than a limited knowledge of the history of the Man of Steel. With the exception of ""The Warrior of the final dawn"" & ""mine enemy grows colder"", none of the stories here offer anything meaningful. Whats equally puzzling is the absence of several notoroius Superman villains such as Brainiac, Parasite, Bizarro, Intergang etc."
1,"Super performance, defective CD.","The actual performance is outstanding, and sonically the recording is excellent. BUT, track 4 and part of track 5 have a defective SACD layer that renders the CD useless in SACD playback. If you just play the CD in normal CD audio mode it's fine."
1,Good title - terrible content,"The only thing that proves that ""Robert Craig"" is a man writing from a woman's perspective is that his lens is off kilter; his insights are not very good and the writing is poor. His character Geoffrey is a badly cast 1-d persona who, given his fondness for, must be based on himself yet portrays aboslutely no discernable traits from the piece of tissue I've been wiping my nose with all morning (home sick hence must read what's available)The only worse read I've ever been subject to was Cecelia Ahearn's Whatever it was called. People who have this standard of writing shouldn't be called authors and certainly shouldn't be daubed as ""witty"" or ""compelling"" as my back cover foolishly advertised."
5,Better than GOOD!,"You have got to get this cd! After hearing them in person this past Sunday, I had to go out and get the cd for myself! This cd is the bomb!"
4,Not BOS but...,"I know a lot of fans wanted this to be BOS 2, but cmon. This album has some flaws, but it has some great songs and has a rawness to it that I think was intended."
2,WHAT IS THIS S**T???,"I THOUGHT ZAKK WAS DONE WITH THE WHOLE PRIDE AND GLORY THING. HE HAD RETURNED TO DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST,..RECORDING KICKASS METAL ALBUMS. THIS IS MORE OF THAT PRIDE AND GLORY CRAP THAT SUCKS BAD!!! ZAKK SHOULD JUST STAY AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN ROCK SOUND. HE IS NOT VERY GOOD AT IT."
1,Limp Bizkit heavier and more talented than ZAKK???,"Let me first start off by saying I loved Book of Shadows... why? because even though the songs were slow and soft, they still hit you in the gut, for the song writing was amazing... ever try to play some of the acoustic stuff on that album?? simply mind-blowing stuff..Hangover, or should I say ""waste of hard earned cash"", was simple strumming and boring lyrics.. something a first year guitar student would write..What makes this even album worse is that it is BLS!!!!! Proven Metal machine ... this isn't some Zakk side project.. these are the guys that came to my town last year and blew [me] off... it's a shame.. Zakk, you should be embarrased for what you did to all of us... When I saw you had a new album coming out, I couldn't wait... thanks for ruining 2004 with this pathetic display.."
2,This should be two and a half stars.,"First of all, I am a huge fan of Zakk Wylde. I thoroughly enjoyed his last album ""The Blessed Hellride,"" which had a good mix of ballads, heavy down tuned riff music and many examples of Mr. Wylde's technical brilliance. In case you didn't notice, his vocals have suffered since his album ""1919 Eternal."" He's not a trained vocalist, and he doesn't necessarily care for his vocal chords. However, it's probably more due to all his drinking. Alcohol is not good for the liver, the brain, or this album. For those of you who think his voice is improving, just compare his current vocals to his Pride and Glory repertoire. His Zepplin cover really shows his talent and ability. He sounds worse than Ozzy these days. As for his guitar playing, he's never played faster. But, he's starting to recycle his licks. Although he still plays well in a jam session, I have to say, Hey Zakk, please start living up to your own standards!"
3,Zakk Wylde Switches to Light Beer,"For fans of Black Label Society's brutal riffs and distorted vocals....don't expect much of that on this album. Zakk returns to his Pride & Glory/Book of Shadows roots playing stripped down rock and roll. He is very reminiscent of Joe Cocker on his cover of Procol Harum's ""Whiter Shade of Pale"". The leadoff track ""Crazy or High"" sets the tone for this album, sincerely rough. If you are a major Zakk fan, this album will definately please your appetite and cure your hangover in the morning. I thought it was very cool that his Pride & Glory bassist James Lomenzo plays bass on a few tracks to give it that old-school sound!"
5,This is a fantastic album,"This is a great album. While a little heavier than Zakk Wylde's ""Book of Shadows"", this certainly can be considered his idea of ""SAP"" or ""Jar of Flies"". This is a great record with some mellow stuff as well as some heavier stuff. A must have for an Zakk Wylde fan."
4,BLS Slows It Down,"I just want to say that anyone who purchased this album thinking it was going to be A heavy metal riff fest has to be either the stupidest or most ignorant BLS fan alive. Had you taken anytime to read anything Zakk had to say in the press then you would have been fully aware of what you might find on this disc. Don't worry, Zakk has not gone soft, but showed us his softer side, which is just as brilliant and dark as his harder stuff. The next BLS album will be a monster with guitars from he**, so sit back and listen to a great rock record and stop whining."
3,wonderful...,"This cd has onley 2 great songs,they are CrazyorHigh,and HouseofDoom.If you realy like BlackLabel,then get this cd,if you realy like your cds hard rocken from front to back,this might not be the one to get.If you onley like to download ""songs""off the internet,get those two I mentioned and then GET HIT BY A CAR!,because the real joy is in listening to the whole cd of what you like,not just a song here and a song there.Thats why alot of cd's suck nowadays,because everyones to focused on hits and singles and crap.......................I onley hope i can get into the whole cd someday................."
1,What Happened?,"I've been a big BLS Fan since Sonic Brew came out, which was an outstanding heavy metal album. I bought Book of Shadows and Pride and Glory and loved both albums. Zakk's vocals and guitar playing was both thoughtful and impressive. This new album should not even be compared to Book of Shadows, though. The lyrics are unprofound, the solos sound forced, and Zakk's vocals are not impressive. He does not sound like the same vocalist on the ""Book of Shadows"" album. He sounds more like Ozzy. Anyways, I feel ripped off for spending 20 bucks on this, so just a warning. Still a BLS fan for life"
3,Simply too melodic...,"In an age, were a war is being waged to keep heavy music alive and to strengthen it beyond its greatest boundaries, one of the ""mvps"" of heavy metal offers a disc that would cater to fans of Evanescence. The tracks that open the disc are rather good, sounding a bit more melodic and grungy than what I'm used to hearing from BLS. However, the disc quickly turns into a yawner of heartfelt piano anthems. I don't think this is what we need on the mainstage of Ozzfest. I say bump Lamb of God or Slipknot up. For a much better dose of heavy metal check out the new one from God Forbid entitled ""Gone Forever"" or ""As the Palaces Burn"" from the as for mentioned Lamb of God."
3,Not BLS,"For me, this album was quite disappointing. I bought it knowing that it was supposed to be a little bit mellower, but bearing the BLS name, i figured it would still be a heavy album. Wrong. I can't take anything away from Zakk as being an extremely talented musician today, but i agree with a previous review in that he shouldn't have called this Black Lable Society, because it's just not as heavy as the other BLS albums. And another thing that really blew me away was the piano ballads. You can't put two skulls on the cover of a cd with more than one piano ballad, lol. Once again, this shows how incredibly talented Zakk Wylde really is, but it's just wrong to call it Black Label Society. I believe a more appropriate title for the cd would be Zakk Wylde-Not so Wylde. If you dig heavier acoustic music, this is for you, otherwise, look elsewhere for his heavy stuff."
1,junk.......,"This is a redneck album, fueled by Zakk Wylde's racist beliefs. Anyone who gives this album more than one star is racist. btw, this is a miserable album.Highlight: Your trailer park neighbourhood wouldnt mind it even at high volume."
2,Major Disappointment,"This cd would be alright if it had been released under the Zakk Wylde name alone, like ""Pride & Glory"" and ""Book Of Shadows"", but as a BLS cd, it does not cut it.Do not let the song titles fool you...this is a totally mellow cd. Cool songs include ""Crazy Or High"", ""Steppin' Stone"" and ""House Of Doom"". Even these tracks are extremely mellow for BLS. As usual, all tracks include awesome guitar solos and guitar work in general. Pop ""Just Killing Time"" or ""Spoke In The Wheel"" in the cd player before buying this and you'll be ready for this cd.In closing, this is not a bad cd, just not a BLS one."
2,Buy Book of Shadows Instead,"I had high hopes for this album and was highly disappointed since The Blessed Hellride was so great. There are about 4 good tracks but on the others, Zakk is singing out of range which makes the songs sound ridiculous. Also, most tracks are way over-produced so if you are looking great acoustic work by Zakk, buy Book of Shadows, one of the best albums ever."
1,"big disappointment, even for Book of Shadows fans","Let me preface this by saying that I've been a Zakk Wylde fan ever since he joined Ozzy Osbourne's band in the late 80's. I loved Pride & Glory and enjoyed his BLS projects, but none really matched my love for Book of Shadows.Having said that, you can imagine I had high expectations for Hangover Music Vl 6. Boy, was I disappointed. The songwriting severely lacks. It sounds as if Zakk really rushed through these songs. Unfortunately, Zakk never had the best voice in the world, but he was always able to back it up with either crushingly heavy guitars or great songwriting. Here, there's some decent guitarwork, but much of the time, it doesn't flow with the song. ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" sounds like it was performed during a drunken hangover, hence the album's title. All I have to say is, Zakk, what happened?!?"
5,Scrapbook Teacher,"This is a great book encompassing every aspect of scrapbooking for the beginner and experienced crafter. It's easy to read and understand, offering a great deal of layouts. I couldn't put it down. This book will definitely take the fear out of beginning scrapbookers and challenge others to try new techniques."
1,Rip- Off,"Beware! I purchased this product knowing that it came with no cables or power supply. No worries for me, because I own all kinds of power supplies as well as miles of USB, Firewire, whatever cable is needed, right? WRONG! What is needed to operate this is proprietary interface cables and power supplies and they are expensive ($37.99 for the USB interface cable). Save your money. BAFO makes excellent hard drive enclosures complete with everything you need for less than fifty bucks."
2,"beware of ""ONLY'",This is ONLY a part of a system for making a removable drive in a PC or making an external enclosure. Other components are needed and are expensive.
3,If_Only_U_New,"I think the first reviewer was maybe expecting the DRIVE BAY CRADLE (AEED35FR), so the enclosure (AEED35U) could be used as a removable hard drive. Amazon doesn't seem to stock this part however, so you might want to keep looking."
5,Solo voice,"The review from 2000 must have the wrong Sainkho Namtchylak album in mind. Lost Rivers is Namtchylak's voice -- that's it. No DJs, no ""inovative rythm section"" [sic] at all. While I'm on the subject, what the heck is ""asian wail""? Give me a break.The album is consistently creative and inventive in how Namtchylak takes throat-singing to new territories at the outer limits of ""singing"" (which is a pretty narrow term for what she does). The music overflows with feeling. Recommended for anyone interested in extended vocal technique."
4,"Not the most educational, but fun.","The game I was sent was actually warped and the spinner looks like it has been through the ringer.However, after playing it for the first time tonight, my 4, 7, and 9 year olds LOVE it.The other negative, other than the condition, is that I fail to see how it is really eduacational. The spinner shows the actual toppings from the pizza rather than the fractions so my kids were more likely to call, ""I got a mushroom"" than to say, ""I get 1/2""."
3,Fun fractions but very basic,"If your goal is to use this game to get your children to understand basic fractions you won't be disappointed. If however you've been working with fractions and your child understands them (say you involving them in cooking where measuring is required), you may find this too basic. While it's great to know that 4 quarters make a whole and you can add 1/2 and 2/4 and get a whole, that's about the extent of the creativity this game offers. My child gets frustrated because other than those combinations, (and the regular 4/4 etc.) he can't add the pieces of pies with different toppings and make a whole pie. Good, but not great. Could be much much better or perhaps the company could offer a more advanced game?"
4,Auntie's fraction game,"This game is very educational, I think that we are going to have loads of fun with it"
5,Must need for nurses.,Originally ordered as supplemental reading for a classes. All nurses should have a copy.
3,late,I chose 3 stars because I received it past the expected 2 week time frame. Book is in appropriate shape.
1,Don't buy from here,"I never recieved this book. I would like my money returned. Being a graduate student, I did not have time to deal with not recieveing this book in a timley manner during my class.Now that it is over I just wanted to let you know. I ended up having the instructor make copies for me to use for class."
4,Very hard to find product readily available on-line,"I couldn't find them anywhere in my area, I used them fro a christmas project at work"
2,"If you are for gun control, you will like this book.","Otherwise, I liked the movie Taps much better. This book makes several off hand references to the NRA and takes a very anti-gun stance. It could have been written by Sarah Brady."
5,Feather on the wind,"What can you say when words are not enough. The first time I heard this I found to my astonishment tears flowing which for some bizaar reason refused to stop. The music is soothing, relaxing and goes to your very essence of being.At the end you feel a surge of release as if everything you have bottled up inside has been let go and you are renewed.I thank the Universe for giving Golana the gift that he has and I thank him for sharing his gift with us all."
1,Awful & Cheap movie!,"How far these once fine actors have fallen to have ""starred"" in this bombshell!This has to be the cheapest made movie i have ever watched! The story line sucked,it didn't wrap up what story there even was. It was just awful! The ""special effects""and i use the term loosely, were pitiful. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,WoW,"The special features more than made up for the lack of plot, directing, acting and cinemetography. This is by FAR the WORST movie I have EVER seen!! The only reason I even give two stars is the cast interviews are friggin HILARIOUS! The actors take it so serious! I feel bad for em, but it is soo funny! You could tell they actually thought they were in a real movie. They must have felt like bad when they actually saw it. Seriously, a junior high skit would be better. Only watch if you are stoned."
1,Most awful movie ever!,"I bought this movie because I like Kevin Sorbo and the premise sounded good.Boy was I wrong! This movie was just horrible. I don't know how it was filmed but it sucked. Michael Pare looked horrible and the whole storyline was awful. A woman talked for over 20 minutes telling you the story while you just saw some of the actors just standing there saying stupid lines and it was like a very bad comic book effect.Kevin Sorbo was trying to play his part as comedy but it was terrible. I did like seeing Lee Horsley from the Sword and Scorcerer movie, but even he couldn't save this movie.The whole plot was dumb and even some nudity didn't help.Don't waste your money buying this movie. I really hope Kevin Sorbo makes better movie choices in the future. He's better than this fiasco!"
1,really bad,"I could not even get through the first half hour, do not even bother unless you are into cheezy b rated films was not expecting much and got less"
4,hir care,"I have extemely long fine hair, and am some what lazy so I can wash my hair with this product and not have to use any other hair care"
5,LOVE IT,"This shampoo has changed my hair completely. I have gone from thin, broken, dull, hair for 23 years to long, shiny, and beautiful hair. Everyone has commented on the change and it feels wonderful. Thank you for such a great product. Everyone should try it. Also, the shampoo smells wonderful."
5,My favorite,"I decided to try this shampoo after reading all the good reviews and I wasn't disappointed. Moreover, this has been so far the best shampoo for my hair. I don't even need to use conditioner after this product. My hair look so much better. I have fine hair and I am always trying to find solution to add volume to my hair. This shampoo together with Chi Silk Infusion oil gives my hair volume with natural look and very soft feeling. I wish this product was available at the drug stores."
4,Ok product,"My only complaint is that the heads (which come painted) of the nails used to fasten the edging tend to lose the paint when struck with a hammer. My recommendation is to use a mallet. Otherwise, no complaints with this product."
4,Works great,"This works well in the shower. I've had it for about a month in the dorms and really like it. It's a little tall, I would possibly like it a little shorter and a little wider for easier access to my toiletries but it's definitely worth what I paid for it."
4,A book not only for the christian reader,"Rumors of Another World is a fascinating book by best-selling author Philip Yancey for anyone who has ever looked around and wondered, ""Is this all there is?"".Rumors of Another World is brimming with questions, stories, and ideas about the search for ""another world"".Unlike other books about faith, Rumors of Another World is honest about the lifelong struggle to believe. ""I am where you are"", explains the author. ""I'm an ordinary person trying to figure this out. I'm a human being and I love, I weep, my friends die, I experience beauty..."" Rumors of Another World eavesdrops on this inner dialogue.Rumors of Another World is a book for anyone who has ever looked around and wondered, ""Is this all there is?...There's gotta be something more.""When I first saw this book I thought it was just another christian non-fiction book. After reading through it though, I realize you can use the principles in this book no matter what religion you are."
4,Perfect gift for the person struggling with belief today,"I'm not the sort of person who normally reads books that would fall into the category of religious literature. Like many people today, I'm not entirely comfortable with discussions of faith and religion. Most books on faith seem too preachy and earnest, and they don't really speak to my life.But I was raised attending church, and there are times when I wonder why I don't believe all the things that were so easy to believe when I was a kid, but seem so hard to believe now, when the world seems very scientific and certain.Yancy's book asked many of the same questions I often ask myself, and didn't come across as preachy. I think this is the sort of book any young person today could read and learn from, without feeling like they were being proselytized to."
3,Rumors of Another Book,"If you're a Yancey fan as I am, you're going to buy his books regardless of any reviews. I simply want to warn everyone that this book is also sold as 'A Skeptic's Guide to Faith'. So if you have a copy of that book, don't buy this one."
5,Spiritual Riches,God's grace expounded by an awfully good word-smith. Well worth your time in reading. A reasoned approach to what's beyond death's door.
4,inspiring book,"I am not an avid reader, but I decided to give ""Rumors of Another World"" a try after a friend mentioned it. I enjoyed it -it is not the ""average"" religious book, as Phillip Yancey discusses things I wouldn't expect to be in a book in the ""religious section"" of a bookstore. It was an inspiring book. It made me think more about questions that I wonder and ask myself. He addresses topics that have confused me in the past, but he did a great job of making it understandable while not lecturing. It is hard to describe in just a few sentences, but I would recommend others to read it."
5,Thought Provoking,"Rumors of Another World is an excellent spiritual book for doubters and wavering unbelievers. All of Yancy's books deserve 5 stars. He is an outstanding writer and his books are easy to read. Right now I am looking at my bookshelf which includes eleven of his books Each one is a masterpiece of Christian writing because of the author's extensive research. As he struggles with common questions of faith in his own life, and discovers answers that satisfy, he shares them with the world and helps provide us with a solid faith foundation.When I complete a Yancy book, I always have the same feeling ""the author must read my mind!"" This book probes the fine line between the real world and an invisible world. The insights provided strengthen belief in a creator God.I recommend his book ""I Was Just Wondering"" along with this one."
4,Thought provoking read,The book is pretty good. I recommend it as a refreshing uplift to rejevenate perspective from the scriptures.
2,Poor quality,"For $40 I was hoping for thick and luxurious towels. These aren't. Certainly they are large, and soft, but they are much thinner than towels I have bought elsewhere."
2,Big in size but modest on value,"As with the other reviews I now see, they are not as thick as I expected for a ""quality"" towel but still not as thin as an inexpensive beach towel. And I am also experiencing the unraveling of the towel end seams after only five washes. Otherwise the size is good."
2,Nice big fluffy towels,"That leave nice big fluffy lint balls all over you, your floor, your face, your hair, your hands, and your washer/dryer.Other than, really nice towel. I recommend getting one of each color, and you can match the lint balls on your body with your outfit that day. Snazzy."
3,Awesome -- until they got washed,"I loved these towels when they arrived. The color was great, size was wonderful and they were very soft too. The problem with the two sets I received is the durability of them. They all started falling apart after they were washed less than 6 times. The end seams fell out and the towels started fraying, badly. I really liked these but I think I'd pick something else next time. It's too bad because the towels themselves are still very thick and beautiful except the badly frayed ends. It's too embarrassing to have these hanging in the bathroom when guests might see them."
4,Famous Maker Bath Sheet 2-Pack,"Beautiful fabric, the ends are not well sewn, but the fabric washes well and looks nice."
1,what's the point?,"why are you listing things that are not available, you just lost a customer, you waisted my time."
4,"Good bargain, but ...",I find that I have to throw them in the dryer after each use. They don't seem to air dry overnight. I also noticed the hem stitching in a couple of spots was unravelling (this has not yet caused a problem using them).
5,Fits REAL balalaika,This is a great product. I've had it two years now and it holds up and keeps my very old balalaika safe. Very happy I purchased it.
5,TRACK LISTING,TRACKS:1. Someone (Furious F. Radio Edit)2. Someone (Original)3. Someone (Unplugged)4. Someone (Furious F. Extended Mix)5. Someone (Jan Vervloet Remix)6. Someone (Chill Out Beatz)
5,*****,"""someone"" is my favorite song on the entire album. now, with these remixes it is taken to a whole new level. i love it.it's a beautiful song on its own. kind of sad and meloncholic in a way in its ballad form. but the dance versions are superb. i prefer this to listen to your heart. here's hoping dht isnt gonna turn out to be a one hit wonder...."
4,Great new hit!,"I really liked this song by DHT. The rhythm is awesome and the tune easy to learn. A definite ""must have"" in your love song collection."
4,"Review of ""Last of the Mohicans""",A Classic tale of the early frontier. Daniel Day Lewsis is a great actor. Dramatic scenery and a gripping plot.Denis Graves
4,VERY FUNNY COMEDY,"This very funny comedy stars George Wendt as a laid back kind of dude. His up tight, mean wife, Robin Duke. This is just a classic comedy. John Candy directs and has a small cameo as a Russian terrorist. This movie is so much funnier and better than most expect it to be. It costs a lot, I know. But at least rent it or find it somewhere."
1,Dangerous,"We bought the red one online (not from amazon). It arrived with a cracked front wheel. We thought ""ok. no problem. We will exchange for the pink one at the store (babies r us)."" (We have too many pink things for her so we opted for the red one initally. They are both the same btw).We put three things together and noticed one of the plastic screws attached to the main piece was broken off. This product is too cheap apparently.It's a shame too because they look great! The windshield cannot be put in place well enough by design - so it kept falling off every time we attempted to move to the next step in the instructions. I spoke to other mothers who have had this and they complained about the same thing. Sadly, the legs crack and come apart - most assumed it was from wear and tear. But judging from our experience it is a case of poor products. Please don't buy this jeep. It's so easy to break."
2,C-,"My husband and I came to the conclusion that a bored engineer designed this walker. It is unnecessarily complicated to put together. The windshield repeatedly falls apart and the fake ""tires"" won't stay in place. It is also difficult to adjust the height. It is very bulky and is difficult to maneuver. My son does fine on linoleum, concrete or wood. BUT he cannot move it over the carpet.I would recommend something less bulky.~Aiden's Momma"
4,TOO CUTE,"MY daughter loves her new Jeep!!! It was a sinch to put together, the one and only thing i dont really like about it is that its so hard to adjust the height. But its worth it.. and also the steering wheel pops out so you can use the tray for feedings or whatever you want.. makes clean up easy!!love it !!!"
5,Awesome,"As a die-hard FMA fan, I had to start getting the dvds. This started my collection right now. It shows the first four episodes of FMA. I was taken down Memory Lane, just enjoying the first four. The first four episodes are really good, and they tell you who our heroes are and where they came from. You'll definitely be wanting to get the second dvd after watching this one."
5,One of the greatest animes of all time,"I was so blown away with this whole series. It's absolutely amazing. Character design, story, pacing of the series - top notch. It deals with some fantastic themes in life, which makes it a must watch anime. If you haven't seen this, please go watch!"
4,we will see,"Ive seen the series through fan subs. Its an amazing story. It has action and comedy. It keeps your attention as well.However, the main thing to be concerned about is what changes the american distribution company, Funimation, is going to make. They have done BAD things to other animated series. Your best bet is to hope there is an ""uncut"" dvd that includes original japanese voice actors, original music, and subtitles. If not I would pass on paying money for this for you will be getting bad rock music, changed story lines, and voice actors that do not match the characters."
2,Failed attempt at Humor,"I found this to be goofy, slapsticky, and yet not funny. It seemed as if they were either trying to make a satire on action/anime cliche's, or just make a goofy funny Anime but they missed the mark entirley. Me Ive seens Anime's for decades, the only people I could see maybe thinking this as being funny would be someone that had never seen an anime. Its certainly not something to be taken seriously if you like serious intense action, this ones just goofy all the time."
3,"Not a bad DVD, but could have been done better","This DVD includes the first 4 episodes of the 51 that encompass the Fullmetal Alchemist series. While this is one of the best shows that I have ever seen, I have a few problems with this release.1.Stickers were on the box not on the plastic.2.Too low episode count per disc at $30 to be reasonable at 13 DVDs total.The content of the disc is good but only recomended if you have the money to buy all the DVDs at once because the later episodes are so amazing that you will forget the meaning of patience. This series is not rcomended if you do not like a fight scene every episode."
5,One of the Best Anime ever,"If you are looking for an action packed and humorus anime, then Fullmetal Alchemist is the one for you! It's a little pricy because it's $20 per disc and the disc only has four episodes. But it's well worth the price. It will keep you wanting to watch it over and over again. People say that the jokes about Ed's height get old, but they don't! It's always hilarious to see ed freak out and overeggatrate the comments! All in all, Fullmetal Alchemist is a terrific anime!"
1,"not tan, wrong product, over priced","As seen in a previous review, I should have listened. I was willing to pay more for a cream/tan colored track. This is the same brown/orange track that is normally about half this price. Don't order here, get the cheaper track. its the same exact thing. Id like to send an email and complain but I think it will end up being more hassle than what its worth to send it back. Oh well, next time ill heed the advice of the reviews."
5,"Great Item, exactly what I was looking for!","Upon searching every hardware and home improvement store, No one could find me the item I was describing, I searched amazon and ebay and within 5 minutes found this item. I ordered it and in less than 1 week had it at my door and it was exactly what I needed. Worked effectively and is a great product."
3,Does the trick,It's an ok product. Does its job. You have to be careful when you install it because it whitens pretty easily. Also its pretty flexible so you have to pay attention to set it up straight and put enough screws or nails so it won't move. Would love to find it in black color - or better in Aluminum alloy.
4,"Excellent Book, but not Exactly for a Beginner!",This is a wonderful book with beautiful pictures but I don't think that it is quite at the beginner level. I think you need to have a little bit of experience before you can tackle this book. What would definitely have helped was adding more pictures showing step by step instructions for molding the characters instead of one or two pictures followed by written instructions. If the extra pictures were added this book would be PERFECT and do able for a beginner!! Overall it's a great book and I would definitely recommend getting it especially if you like working with fondant as all the cakes are covered with it.
5,Great book!,I will definately get more books by Debbie Brown. Lots of photos to go along with the instructions and the dake designs are awsome.
2,Cartoon Cakes...not as easy as it looks,"This is definitely not a book for beginners...or anyone that doesn't have experience in making clay figures. The intstructions were not that easy to follow. If you followed the written intstructions the characters will not necessarily look like the ones in the book. Maybe I may be a bit of a perfectionist, but I would think if I am making the Flintsones they should look exactly like the Flintstones. I did manage to make the Flintstones cake and it took quite a bit of time to create each character. After spending so much time making Fred, Barney, Wilma and Betty, I didn't have enough time to make Pebbles, Bam-bam or Dino. What a monster of a project to take on!!!!I do enjoy looking at photos in the book because I think the creater did an amazing job. It makes a great book for a coffee table!!!!"
4,Glad I bought this,This book has very detailed step by step instructions. I have already made The Scooby Doo haunted mansion cake and it turned out great. I have also been practicing some of the other characters in clay.
3,Cut key parts of movie,This was not the movie I saw on the big screen. Danny Devito's role is completely edited out. Marsha's disappointment when she finds her prince charming hooked her up with a nerd. Classic moment in the movie gone. But why? They should have the director's cut on VHS also.
3,"Car Wash,Good Moral ending.","I like the story,the era's music and the players involved.I like that the militant is portrayed as just another useful tool,I like that the annoying son of the owner of the Carwash is ignored when reading About Mao and wearing A Mao shirt throughout which is annoying and ironic living in the capitalist West.I like the Ex-Con who is bettering himself and didn't have to convert to Crazy Sect of Islam or be a 5%er.All in all funny at times and a good heart to it even with it's low points."
5,FUN NOSTALGIA,"If you want a taste of the 70s, this is the perfect movie. It is silly, dumb, touching, and hip as it gives us a glimpse into the lives of the car wash employees who all have their hopes and dreams and frustrations like the rest of America. Love the fro! And the soundtrack!"
