1,Big disappointment,Not in Spanish language just subtiles. I wanted this for two boys (5 & 6) here in Mexico whose father has deserted them. BIG BIG BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.
3,Good movie,"Band of Misfits was a fun film for me and my daughter to watch on a Saturday afternoon. We're big Wallace and Gromit fans, so it was fun watching something different from the guys who do that. We especially enjoyed the self-absorbed, close but not quite evil Darwin angle (Ha! Hope that's not a spoiler. :-/). We also both recognized the Flight of the Conchords song and sang along. Good times!"
4,Witty dialouge good animation,I enjoyed this animation for its witty dialouge and good animation. Characters had some definition and storyline was inventive. The ending was a bit shallow and it all seemed too short but I still thought it did a decent job developing its plot.
3,AARDMAN doesn't necessarily mean Nick Park,"I have nothing against this fluffy little effort from Aardman. It's colorful, it's loud, it's funny in a bland, family sort of way. But I just wanted to let anyone thinking of buying this that ""Pirates"" has the involvement of Nick Park, the genius (yes, genius) behind the earlier delightful, wry and hilarious classics as ""Chicken Run"", ""The Wrong Trousers"", etc. It does not. When I bought ""Pirates"", I automatically thought that anything that looks like Aardman and was made by them had to have Nick Parks participation. This one doesn't and is weaker for that fact. It's perfect for kids to watch safely with (or without) their parents; nothing to offend. Just don't expect those extra levels of brilliance Park's products inherently possess."
4,Claymation is AWESOME,"This is a wonderful comical movie from some of the best claymation artist. It's a steam punk style movie and the storyline is predictable. The movie is perfectly fine for kids, although they may not understand many of the jokes. It's quite enjoyable to watch as an adult. I very much recommend it to everyone."
3,Jd,"Very difficult to understand accents particularly in the beginning of the movie. A little advanced linguistically for a 5 year old. However, visually very good."
4,Pirate booty,The animation is excellent and the absurd story is funny and moves along well. My 7 and 12 year-olds thought really enjoyed it.
3,Sorry movie!,Movie was not funny! Only purchased it as I thought it would be as good as Chicken Run but it was not. I will read the reviews the next time!
3,Martin Freeman silly guy,"I fell for Martin in Sherlock but when I needed a head break I found he was in the The Pirates and it was good, really good the story is great for children kinda maybe 7 year old boys?"
2,"Great visuals, mediocre plot.","My husband and I enjoy Wallace and Gromit, so we were a bit disappointed with this movie. They put a lot of work into the great visuals, but the story wasn't the best. The movie wasn't holding our attention, and it seemed to drag. We didn't turn it off, but we did decide to do some chores while watching the last half of it. We also thought that the horrible depiction of Queen Victoria (which was meant to be funny), just came across as stupidly offensive. Maybe this movie would be more entertaining for a very young audience."
3,good,The kids were entertained very funny a Wallace n grommet feel can't wait to add to DVD collection for the kiddos
3,Beautiful animation,"Not the best from Ardman Studios, still worth a gander. Story was ok. The Characters were original and entertaining! I would recommend this to anyone interested in animation and of course as a family movie."
4,Pretty entertaining and funny,This movie is a lot of fun. Wasn't expecting much so it was better than I hoped.The animation is also really cool. Classical claymation.
4,My kids loved it,this was a really cute movie that my kids loved. It had some funny parts and I thought it had a good message about friendship.
3,Pirates Beware,Overall a decent family film but not much more than that. If you are a Wall& Gromit fan it's worth seeing as the claymation is excellent.
1,From big screen to dvd quick,"The story was slow. The characters , even as clay animation, were over acting. Ha. I kid., but really it was not a good. flick"
1,not a kid movie,Started watching this with two kids. 5 and 8. They both asked to watch something else after about twenty minutes into it. So I don't know If it got better but out didn't start out good.
2,Poor sound engineering,"I was excited to hear this piece since it was recorded in the new Disney Hall. Unfortunately, the miking on this recording misses. The percussion is very muted on this piece which ruins the whole effect. Get Levi's recording with Atlanta or Gergiev with St. Petersburg."
3,Speed performance,"Good sound, but the fastest paced ""Rite"" I have ever heard. It loses the dramatic effect for me when a piece of music is played at such breakneck speed. Impressive musicians to keep up this speed of tempo."
4,Bald Mountain too fast. Stravinsky and Bartok Great. Fabulous Sonics,"Let me begin by saying that the sonics on this disc are absolute benchmark level. I don't know if it's the new Disney Concert Hall or DG's characteristically excellent recording techniques, or both, but as recording quality goes this is FABULOUS.The recording itself is made up of modern works. In summation, the Stravisky is great. This highly percussion driven piece is great. All of the bass drum and timpani hits have delicious impact, and the playing is, as expected immaculate. Bartok is good as well.What I have issue is with the speed of Night on Bald Mountain. Maestro Salonen, where's the fire? I know this piece is supposed to sound driving but in my estimation a comfortable exceeding of the speed limit would suffice rather than the frenetic race to the end he achieves."
1,Maruanne Faithfull CD,"I am a little disappointed with my purchase. Had I known the item was from Korea I would not have purchased it. The artist's name was misspelled in almost every place that it was printed on the item. Most of the songs on the CD are ones that I've not heard by this artist before, so who knows whether they are legit or not. File it away to the tune of $25 and be more careful they next time.Jim"
2,Okay ... but Emilie Simon's soundtrack was greatly superior,"Why would someone ditch Emilie Simon's excellent original soundtrack (now available as ""March of the Empress"") in favor of this insipid, predictable music? The soundtrack to the original French version, ""La Marche de L'Empereur,"" is uniquely suited to the film's atmosphere, evoking frosty, stark landscapes and the mystery and adventure of penguin life. That soundtrack is available and should be heard before buying this CD. Adventurous souls may also be interested in acquiring the original version of the movie in French--which, incidentally, has much less talk-over, allowing viewers to absorb the images more directly. Unfortunately, it's a bit difficult to find the French version in the U.S., though it is readily available from Amazon.ca."
4,SCORE ON ICE,"There are 2 or 3 tracks on this soundtrack that are worth hearing over and over. The others are ok, thats why I didnt give it a perfect 5. If you liked it, you would really like the Winged Migration soundtrack. Another soundtrack I really recommend is from A Beautiful Mind ."
2,A Disappointment,"This rare opera only has three recorded performances, and this must be the worst. While one can still perceive the beautiful music of Spontini, but it is like listening through a tin can tied to a string. To add to its problems, it has been ""abbreviated"" to make it ""fit into an hour"" and is sung in Italian vice the original French. Its one high point? Availability. ((Oh, others have noted the early Tebaldi voice...but I frankly couldn't hear it)."
2,No Pronunciation of Portuguese,"This dictionary is desinged for Portuguese students, so it doesn't provice what an English speaker needs, e.g. pronunciation. Also the picture dictionaries do not give the Portuguese words for the things pictured. So if you are just stargint this is not the one you want. If you are trying to extend your vocabulary, or hate the tiny type enough to give up pronouncing it,, this can serve for you. And of course if you are um Brazileiro, it was designed for you."
4,Requires skill and patience but worth it,"You can buy direct-fit oxygen sensors that are ""plug and play,"" but they cost significantly more than these Bosch universal type fitments. Just make sure your original plugs are in good shape.I used these on a 2004 Ford Escape 3.0L to replace the downstream sensors. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. This was the first time I've used/seen ""posi-lock"" wire connectors, but I was able to figure out immediately how to install it. The wire length was more than adequate. In total, I spent just over an hour changing both O2 sensors."
5,Palermo valances,"Super good service, arrived about 3 days after ordering. They are absolutely perfect! Could not be more pleased!"
5,Happy with the purchased,Shipment arrived within 2 days. Very pleased with the curtain. Goes well with my tuscany/wine kitchen theme. Good quality product.
4,A Jazz Soundtrack,"I stumbled across the movie and enjoyed it as a movie. What got me was the music. I had to buy the soundtrack. Fictional radio station WLOH, with Lyle Lovett as the DJ playing Jazz for the Tri-C Jazz Festival over a rainy three days in Cleveland. Having grown up in Cleveland, I know that there are many times when three days of rain is not only possible, it's almost commonplace. The music on this soundtrack is amazing, original and took me away. I'm truly impressed with the way it matches the events in the movie, yet stands out on its own beautifully. It's a soothing listening experience that does not require the visual presentation of the movie, yet when matched with the movie it plays well also. In other words, it stands on its own in addition to having worked perfectly in the movie."
4,Great Illusion,This ring gives the incredible illusion of growing or shrinking depending on which way you rotate it. I have shown it to several people and their response has been great. It also stimulates conversation on how it works.
4,she's a genie in a bottle baby.,"this christina aguilera book is cool.this talks all about her about mmc,her album,the video,and everything.the cover of the book is a picture of christina in concert.i would have a gave it 5 stars but there were no color photos."
4,A Great Book For Christina Fans Everywhere,"This book digs very deep into Christina's life. From begining to end, it's all there in print. I enjoyed it and I'm sure all other Christina Aguilera fans will too."
2,not great....,"This book has some nice pictures, but no new information any X-Tina fan doesn't already know. The problem with these books is, they become outdated really quickly. This isn't the place to go if you want up-to-the-minute facts about what Christina is doing.Second, this book gives some wrong, confusing information. For instance, the book mentions a brother named Casey born when Christina was 2, and it says that twin girls were born when Christina was 5. The only siblings Christina has ever mentioned are her younger sister Rachel (who isn't a twin) and a younger half-brother Mike. Why does this book say theres another girl named Stephanie? it's very wierd. So i'd skip this book if I were you...."
1,Terrible,This broke and cracked into pieces the week I got it. It was a waste of money. Also the back slips apart a lot.
2,"Well written, short on facts, long on Levy's story.","A hundred pages into the book, I stopped and said ""Wait, where's the psychology of Wall Street this book touts?"" and realized the book is no more than a work touting Levy's every move.While entertaining and well written, the book is a fast read that is short on substantial information. The book is interesting; it just falls very short of providing any sort of substantial fact or opinion on his psychology of the street premise."
3,"Entertaining, but not very informative","I generally agree with Leon Levy's thesis that behavioral finance moves markets and stocks. It took me a while to grasp this idea after 4 years of Wharton where market efficiency and investors' rationality were expounded. Working as a practioner on Wall Street and living through the recent Internet bubble and subsequent collapse has taught me the value of respecting the effect of investors' psychology on stock prices. That said, I found this book disappointing. Some of Levy's economic and finance theories are dubious, and there were few ideas on how to actually make money from shifting investors' sentiment. Still, the book only took me a couple of hours to read (large print, 200 pages), and it did have some interesting anecdotes. All in all, it's pretty light-weight fare, and ok for a quick browse."
2,Waste of time,"This is a book full of rambling thoughts from a mind that seems past its time. Mr. Levy spends several chapters with pointless stories about himself and his childhood. He also spends half the book talking about what a genius his father was and about the ""great"" book on economics his father wrote- then later admits that he never even finished reading his father's book because it was too boring. There are about 5 decent pages comparing the Internet bubble to past bubbles, but there are no new insights. The rest of the book wanders from pointless story to pointless story."
4,Psychology and Experience,"Leon Levy died in December 2002. He was one of the grand old men of Wall Street. The founder of the Oppenheimer mutual funds, he built himself a truly substantial fortune in the market (Forbes 400 list). This book is not a compendium of investment techniques but the history of an astute trader and a glimpse of how he saw the market. His outlook is largely a combination of basic economics and psychology which appear to have about equal weight. Just before Levy died he wrote an interesting but pessimistic essay on the future of America's economy. He pointed out that there is more than a sniff of deflation in the air. He may still be right. The deflation may be masked by government sponsored financial inflation. On balance, a very interesting book."
4,Useful book,"This book is highly useful. Don't forget about copyright laws. In order to use any of the assessments, you'll need to order them. This book at least shows you all of the questions, and also gives psychometric and ordering info, so that you can sort of ""try before you buy""."
2,New Testament History,I'm not pleased with the service. The book took longer than promised to get to me. I'm way behind in my classes and have to play catch up. I wished the book would have been received on it's promised delivery date. Thanks.
3,Strange but interesting,Strange but interesting. I was there too. I guess we can all see things differently.
1,Passionate slugs & Hollywood frogs,Save your money!! Not even worth buying used. If a field guide is going to be uncommon then it should be full of heart. Lacking this it should have basic info with at least a chuckle. I was left feeling MS Lichen never left her car and read better descriptions of Chickadees from grandma's diaries. Do not be conned by Linda Feltner's good field sketches and the sales package. This book is bought for the illustrations only!
2,Too confusing to follow,"While this was charming and there were several characters to like, this book definitely became too confusing to follow. There were too many references to earlier books, without enough back ground to really refresh a reader's memory. Also, there were too many characters playing roles in this story, and they all seemed to be falling in love with each other (and not for any reason other than being of an appropriate rank/age).In short, while mildly entertaining, keeping track of the plot twists was confusing and made the book difficult to enjoy."
1,Shall We Dance,I have to admit that I usually don't write reviews but this book took all I had not to put it away unfinished. The story is confusing till you are almost through with the book. The characters are so hard to follow that you find yourself spending your time leafing back trying to find out who the author is talking about. I think the story was to be a light easy romance but the complications of the story and characters took away from any enjoyment I had in reading it. I know I will think twice before I read this authors books again.
5,Judith's done it again,"I truly enjoyed this book.Judith has proved that the lon-ger Regency based historical formatted book can be written andmade interesting without any graphic and or gratuitous lovescenes.I loved the mystery in this book,and as always she addsher usual,but unsusal Hero&Heroine,plus a child or two&an ani-mal,in this case a Dexter cow named Susan."
2,Not great...okay,"This novel was an okay kind of read but I've been finding that the theme of late with Ms. Lansdowne's stories. I'll admit that I don't read a great many romance novels, however, when I initially stumbled upon her novel ""Amelia's Intrigue"" I was enchanted and blown away by her characterizations of the men of the ton, especially the two brothers, one of whom suffered from a brain injury as a result of a childhood accident. I can't tell you how many times I've read that novel. Simply stunning. I've recommended it other friends who loved it as well. Another novel that made me laugh out loud and go ""ahh!!"" is her ""Legion's Ladies."" Again, this novel was filled with caring, witty characters and the writing was superb. The novels lately, especially the Nightingale series, were just carbon copies of the typical romance - nothing special; no lovely friendships I so loved about her earlier novels. I think I'll go read my poor, dog-earred copy of Amelia's Intrigue yet again."
1,disappointing yet again...,"Sad for me to say, but there was a time when a Lansdowne book was a must have. I would run out and buy them as soon as they were released. With the start of her Nightingale series (which I hated), and continuing on, I have been consistently disappointed. Her stories now seem to be a mish-mash of characters, most of whom fall in love immediately but then little time is spent on their romantic development. Her romances are too sweet valley high. No, I am not looking for erotic stories, but the cloying ""sweetness"" of all her characters, males and females, the ever present animals, crazy relatives, nutty servants, have been overplayed for me. I guess it is time for me to move on..."
5,A book definitely worth taking the time to read!,Very thought provoking. My book has highlight marks throughout. Very inspirational and a book I am very glad to have read.
4,Capabilities of the Troy-Bilt 10 HP Gas Powered Chipper/Shredder,"This chipper has provided me with a source of mulch and a way to get rid of branches on my property. If prepared properly, the limbs zing right through without any clogging or hold ups. It's easy to use, start, and runs great.It is also easy to push around my mountainous yard. My only problem was when it was delivered without any manuals for either the motor or the chipper, and some parts from the tow bar were missing. Amazon customer service answered all my questions and resolved the problem for me."
3,Short life,"Bought unit new in Jan 2009. Now have about 30 hrs on unit. Have chngd oil twice. Did not use in 2011. 7 days ago I chkd oil level and oil condition, put in new gas to the empty gas tank, got it going again after about 20 pulls. Ran and chipped for about 15 mins, then it abruptly stopped w/ a loud bang. Was putting in 1-1.5"" branches at the time. Couldn't get it going again. Rope start has NO resistance at all. Shredder does not rotate when pulling starter rope. Shredder unit loose. Must be a broken shaft and or broken crank shaft. Awful expensive chipper for 30 hrs of use. Out of warranty of course. Amazon said to contact MTB. Was on hold for twenty mins this a.m. Sent email. We shall see what happens.... It did work pretty good except if you do not have straight branches they get hung up trying to get into the chipper section. It is loud. Leaves do get bunched up in the big hopper. You have to help them along."
5,troy after 2 years Aok,"This is for a county 1/4 acre yard. eats leafs at a good rate, keep a stick handy for the clogging, no problem just feeding it too fast.Use ear muffs loud. I replaced the blades once easy to do be careful very sharp. I had it now 2 years. would not change a thing. I'd say 2.5 inch diameter is about the convenient size to munch. pleanty of power."
1,Disappointment,"Generates more work then chips. It is supposed to chip 3"" material, but anything over 1 1/2"" is a big time challenge. Makes so much noise that ear protection is a must. Not worth the money as far as I am concerned. Don't know how you could use it in the city in the chipper mode, the neighbors wold surely complain."
4,No Bones About It,"I have a Department 56 Haunted Village display, so I had to add this item. Well designed and well packaged. Looks just as described. If it does not make you laugh, and cheer you up, to sit looking at a skeleton in an outhouse, well then I don't know what will?"
4,Beautiful and Gripping Tale of Two Women,"Richard Bausch's ""Hello To The Cannibals"" is an amazing tale of two women who never meet. This interwoven book of a young Victorian women and a modern day girl takes off into an unexpected world of discovery. I loved the language, characters, settings (both modern and historical) and thought it blended beautifully into both worlds.Mr. Bausch is a gifted storyteller with many many wonderful voices inside - waiting to tell their own stories. Can't wait for more of his work... a real triumph!"
2,just OK,"I also heard the author speak at the NW bookfest and was looking forward to reading this. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The Mary Kingsley story is the saving grace, the modern woman's story didn't strike me as authentic or interesting and I found myself skimming those sections. Not horrible, but I cannot recommend it."
2,"Interesting premise, disappointing read","I guess the older I get, the less patience I have for characters mired in unhappiness, and this book is full of those characters. As mentioned by previous reviews, I too found the Mary Kingsley portions of the book more interesting then the fictional storyline.I would advise to skip this book, but do research the remarkable life of Ms. Kingsley."
3,A little more beat up than advertised,"I was replacing this macrame manual that I had years ago and lost so was excited to find one. The price was good. However, I saw nothing in the ad that said pages were completely loose. I think that should have been mentioned. I probably would have bought the book anyways, but felt like that was an important omission."
4,Great product!,This lens is very simple to use... but make sure you purchase VAD-HA adapter before buying this one!
3,Blurry around the edges,"The lens zooms OK, but I find too many pictures where the image is blurry around the edges. I would not buy this again, but might try another brand. Also, the 1.7 zoom is not quite enough to get the real close-ups needed. Maybe 2.2 would do, but 3.2 would be better."
3,Eh.,"The seller was great - delivered the item on time and it was as described. I found this product to be a bit disappointing though. I don't feel it provides very much extra zoom and if anything in the picture moves at all, it is blurry. Perhaps that's on me and due to the way I'm using it, but it didn't end up being as exciting as I thought it would."
4,extra zoom at fair price,"Nice lens. It is not very big in size, mas it makes the camera more unbalanced.The output is good also."
3,not for me,"I do have a DSC-H5, bought this thing and re-sold it after 30 days.It was my ""mistake"" because:* too clumsy/heavy for me, you certainly need a tripod most of the time* taking a photo is a pain and the ""minimum distance"" is also too far away* is really difficult (for me) to take ""long distance"" photos, smog disturbs, preparation is too long ...I went back to the amazing 40-380 lens of the DSC-H5 and I'm very happy with that. Far better for me."
1,No Go,"I am unabnle to say if the lens is god or bad, because there needs to be an adaptor ring with it. I was unable to get the correct ring, although the dealer did try. Sorry, but I had to return it. Th return was handled in a timly manner. Thanks."
5,Sony brings the distance to you,"The Tele-converter is a must have. I live where there are many wild birds. Cardinals, Humming birds, Budgerigars, and many small birds that I am still trying to identify. I can sit on my front porch and pull a Cardinal from 40 feet away to just 2 feet away with this lens. In natural daylight the picture is so crisp and clear you feel like the bird just flew down to your feet to check things out. Sony has done a wonderful job of making a camera and then offering some get lenses to go with it. Oh, the camera is the DSC-H2. A wonder unto itself."
5,Fantastic Lens for the DSC-H2,"This lens attaches to my DSC-H2, via the standard Sony adapter tube, is Great! I just set the Sony on ""tele"" conversion lens, in the menu and put this lens on. It really works well and the photos are better than acceptable. Well worth the money and 10 times better than aftermarket!!.58mm threads"
4,Great lens!,"This lens is exactly what I was looking for, clear, sharp images. The only negative to this lens is it's plastic housing, A metal (aluminum) housing would make it feel and look better, although it doesn't hamper it's ability to take great shots."
5,Sony lens,"The lens is fine. Works perfectly. Images are excellent. The only problem was with the delivery. This object, which obviously required protection on route, was packed in a rather large box. However, it had been thrown into the bottom of the box and a cubic foot of packing material tossed on top, not in any way shielding the lens from the slings and arrows of shipping. Luckily it was not damanged, but no thanks to the packer."
2,Great idea - lousy execution.,Lousy graphics with seemingly ancient software technology. The software for the Limit Texas Hold em is OK and I might get it if I was only playing limit hold em. But there are only preselected amounts you can bet in Pot Limit or No Limit and that's just plain stupid. I wish I could recommend a better product but I haven't been able to find it yet.
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting bayou nature sounds, not nature plus the additional music. I couldn't get into it; I threw it away."
5,music ace review,I really like this software because it is helping my child learn to read music in a fun way. It is very kid friendly and I highly recommend it if you are looking to provide professionnal music lessons for a child. It's fun for adults too!!
5,Very good.,"Excellent intro. Teaches the basics of music. I'm musically challenged but want my kids to be better. I'm using this to teach our family how to read music and understand some theory. It does use the keyboard, but it is still useful if you're wanting to learn a different instrument. We'll be learning the Recorder next school year (with ""Basic Recorder Lessons Omnibus Edition""Basic Recorder Lessons Omnibus Edition).(For homeschoolers. WTM, and some other methods, advocate no software, but this is not at all flashy. Not too ""Sesame Street."" Its like having a music teacher, which is great for homeschoolers who need to teach music, but don't know the subject! Having zero musical talent I truly believe that a book isn't enough to teach this subject. Some sort of live tutor, software, or video is necessary for us.)"
4,Music Ace Starter,It is very similar to the Music Deluxe.I hope the two can be different apparently to avoid buyingboth of them.
2,Analysis Paralysis can kill this one...,"Nice design but can be boring watching other players figure and refigure their routes/methods for travelling. Even so, a little dull as the game is repetitious."
2,"Nice to look at , boring to play","I bought this game because it looks great, but when I start playing it I regretted the buy. It mostly takes too long before you can do something, this takes away one's focus. The game itself is also a little bit too simple and requires not much thinking, this improves when you have more then 3 players, preferably 6 (but then it takes even longer before you can do something). Another problem is that it takes relatively long to explain this game to others.Though there is some hope, you can buy elfish gold, an extension set, which may stir things up."
2,extreme,"The action on the video was extreme, but outdated. It is nice that you don't have to worry about language or questionable content, but I was disappointed to learn that most of filming took place in the early 90's. In the last ten years, I'm sure that the Extremists have pushed the boundaries of their sports even further."
1,Threw it out after a few months,"At first I thought this binder was great. Reasonable price and seemed to work well. After a few months of use, however, the ""teeth"" of the ring stopped meeting all the way together so the papers would come out of the ring when you turned them. Had to buy a replacement and get rid of it- waste of money."
2,Too Much Salt & Too Much Sugar,"This is a very unhealthy story. Too much salt and too much sugar will kill you sooner than later. Campbell Soup Company has many products loaded with salt and sugar. Campbell Soup has a great history in the canning process. However, they have difinitely dropped the ball in this story. They solved the problem of food spoilage by canning, but that is about all."
2,Only for serious economists,"This book is definitely not for the arm-chair investor. Although the idea is very good, a thorough understanding of economics will be required to make this very factual book worthwile."
5,Galé es lo mejor!,"With ""Con El Mismo Swing"", Grupo Galé establishes themselves firmly atop the list of the best salsa groups writing originial music today. This CD has become a staple among myself and my salsa dancing friends. With songs like ""Descarga Galé"", ""Ironías"", and last but not least, the incredible ""Tributo al Gran Combo"". This last song is a tribute to ""El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico"", and if you go to any salsa club these days you're likely to hear it; It's an excellent rendition of several of El Gran Combo's greatest hits, mixed into one song. I just saw them live in Seattle, WA, and I must say they are as good live as they are recorded. Great band!I recommend this CD to any salsa fan."
1,Unreliable,"I had this cook top for about six months and it stopped working. I called and wrote to Viking several times. The would not respond. After several months of trying to get someone to help me, I finally just threw it away. What a horrible waste of money. I have two other brands that I purchased since that have worked for over two years without a hitch. One is the Waring. All in all the Viking customer service for this product was deplorable. I will never buy another Viking product because of this."
3,Seems to create an odor,Like everyone else looking at induction it is a fantastic tool for any kitchen. We received our first Viking unit and put it to use to boil some water. My wife and son quickly complained the unit was putting out a nausiating odor. I called Viking and with no hesitation they sent me another one. This one also is putting out the same nausiating odor. Viking is standing behind the unit as I send the second unit back. I hope we get the odor problem cleaned up because I like the unit.
1,viking burner,"I purchased the viking portable induction burner, was pleased with it but, it only worked ONE day. I returned the burner and it was replaced. The second burner DIDNOT work longer enough to use,I returned it and was told it was on back order. I requested a refund and it was granted without any trouble. the customer service for the refund was very good.I was disappointed with the products performance. I would not purchase this product again. I beleive the product would be great if it worked for any period of time. Thanks"
2,Had to return it,"This didn't fit in a 'new work' electrical box, because it was too thick and the cord wasn't flexible enough."
1,Do not read this book,For whatever reasons the author does not know his facts. Example: On page 497 he refers to the German concentration camps to which Balkan Jews were sent to be murdered as Polish death camps.
4,"Thoughtful, readable account","Aside from briefly studying the Yugoslav Civil War of the 1990s while in college, I didn't know much about modern Balkan history before reading this book. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to gain more insight on the current state of affairs among and within the Balkan countries.Glenny provides a concise, readable account of Balkan histiry since the turn of the 18th century while remaining faithful to his thesis. Perhaps his background in journalism provides the intellectual discipline to avoid straying from his central argument. In any case, this approach makes reading about extremely complex events, trends and historical forces much less confusing.However, based on his account, one gets the impression that the history of this region during this period has been largely reactive. In this respect, the book provides a somewhat limited perspective."
2,Very Disappointing,"This book bites off more than it can chew. Even though the volume is close to door stopper size, the attempt on the part of the author to cover nearly 2 centuries of Balkan history produces a very episodic result. There is no feeling for the people mentioned, only a long series of names, dates and events. And there is very little description of the geographical areas being written about.The author has only succeeded in making a fascinating part of history boring."
4,Good equipment,"I bought mine at a local sporting goods store. I paid $99 on sale. Should have checked amazon. Great bench, if you take care of it, it'll last a good long time."
2,"Sturdy enough, but...","The bench seems sturdy enough, but at 5'5"" I am too tall to rest my feet on the bench while keeping my head also on the bench. For protection of my lumbar region, some of my exercises need to be done with my knees bent and feet (and head) securely on the bench. I'm too short to have to deal with a too-short weight bench! Also, I have neoprene weights ranging from 1-20 lbs.-two each size, none of which fit the weight holder underneath the bench. The holding rods are too far apart - my weights just slip through. You get what you pay for, but these are two fatal flaws, at least for my workouts. It's too much trouble to dismantle and return, so I'll deal with it, but I won't recommend it."
3,"Fun, but not as good as the second","This game was definitely fun, and cool. However, I found the 2nd game better, because this one, Street 3, doesn't really have a story line. In Street 2 you are trying to move up the ranks to be able to play, and defeat, Xhibit. In Street3, it just kind of ends. All of a sudden, it just says CHAMPION! What's up with that? Also, in Street 2, when they talk their mouths actually move. In Street 3 the words come out but they're just moving their bodies, not their lips. But enough negativity towards this game. Street 3 is awesome in the way that you can customize your entire team, just the way you want. I liked the places you get to play at and I liked the bonus footballs you could earn (rather than a Street football, you could play with a baseball football, eyeball, fireball, etc.). I would reccomend this game, no doubt, but I do acknowledge the fact that its predecessor is better."
4,This is a pretty good game,"When I first got the game I didin't think I was going to like it but after I played for an hour I started to enjoy it. Its cool because there are different exhibition games and street events.Street 2 was a bit better, but I would still recommend this game for sport enthusiasts.Alex, age 13"
2,Too many glitches to be fun,"As an owner and player of the first two games, I had high hopes for the third installment of NFL Street. The good news was that the graphics and rosters had been updated. The bad news is that after playing the game for at least an hour with a friend, glitches were evident. I do not remember all of them, but there is a terrible glitch as the line of scrimmage. Before the ball is snapped, the defensive linemen can pretty much jump over the offensive line and sack the quarterback whenever they want. The game loses all appeal when you can't get any positive yardage. If you do not use this glitch, I can see the game being fun with a new list of moves and a new way to use gamebreakers. Overall, I give this game 2 stars out of 5."
3,Mom,"I was a little disappointed. The game does play fine, but its all scratched up and the box was ripped. I just felt a little misled! But the game is fine."
4,Pretty good,"It's a pretty good NFL Street game.. the graphics are better, but the cut-scenes aren't quite that good. The game breaker makes it a little more fair and the new moves are nice. Good game overall, except in RtS when you get to choose what type of game you play every time."
1,Poorly Crafted Popcorn Maker,I purchased this Nostalgia Popcorn Maker to replaced a very good quality Sunbeam Hotair Popper that was accidentally thrown out. This Nostalgia machine worked fine for the first six months (low use) until one day the unit would not respond when switched on. Upon closer examination the popcorn maker was drawing electrical current when switched on but the motor acted as if it was binding and giving off an ozone smell. I contacted Nostalgia explaining the condition of the popcorn maker and they would only replace the popcorn maker under their 90 day warranty with sales receipt. I must have used this machine eight times in a span of less than a year.Giving this popcorn maker one star is generous. I would not recommend this machine to a friend.
3,"Yes, all the bad review are true. But I still like it.","As soon as I opened this as a present I had rock bottom expectations.First the good: It pops popcorn pretty quickly. The heater and blower actually seem pretty powerful.The amusing: this thing will send popcorn everywhere. I was laughing through the whole first use. Un-popped colonels fly everywhere, sometimes popping after they spew out, sometimes flying in the air and hitting you in the face when they do. Sometimes un-popped colonels go into the bowl, then pop and send popcorn and red hot colonels exploding out of the bowl!Highly amusing but incredibly poor design. However with a simple paper towel draped over the bowl properly its completely usable."
2,Wish we could get it to work correctly,"We purchased this popper for my son for Christmas. The size is great, the delivery was great, my son loved it and understands how to use it, we just can't get it to work correctly. It blows hot air and that's about it. At first, we thought it might be the type of popcorn we used but after trying several kinds, it just doesn't work. Would love to know if we are doing something incorrectly because we'd love to use it all the time."
3,Popcorn Popper,After reading many reviews I knew what to expect with this product. My 11 year old wanted it for christmas. The popper is cute and it does pop corn (a small amount at a time) and yes it does shoot out unpopped kernals at you.... The popcorn does not taste good but that is because it is a air popper. If you want one that works really well you are going to have to spend more money. This one works just OK.
3,ok,"It was ok, for the money, it makes a little popcorn at a time and you can't add sault or butter to the machine. It is just hard to give your popcorn flavor after it has been poped. Like at the movies."
1,A waste of counter space,"I saw this item at the store and fell in love with it. I immediately put it on a wish list. Last Christmas I got it as a gift,used it twice and was frustrated with the poor popping quality. I originally thought it was old kernels I was popping, so I bought a new package. No, that didn't work. I hopped on Amazon and was glad to see I wasn't the only one having problems with this machine.This product is terrible, the single good review has GOT to be written by an employee of the company. I have not gotten one decent bowl of popcorn out of it.Do Not buy this... it's very cheaplymade, and not ANY fun"
3,eh,"I got this as a house warming gift and was super excited because of its cuteness. I had the same problems of half the kernels not popping, flying across the room, etc. After about the 5th time I used it, something inside broke and I wound up taking it back. Being that it was a gift and I still think it's really cute, I just exchanged it for a new one. The new one doesn't have the unpopped kernel issue the first one had so I'm guessing that's something that varies between individual machines, though it does still shoot popped kernels across the kitchen. (I aim it towards the wall so it can't go as far...) It's an adorable gift, but if I was going to buy my own air popper, I'd get something cheaper and simpler.Update: after a little over a year, I gave up and replaced this with a generic popper that works way better."
1,Worst Popper I've Ever Used,"I received this product for Christmas from my daughter. We love to make popcorn with our existing air-popper, so we were excited to try this one.What a joke? 80% of the kernels were unpopped. I tried it several times and finally took it back to Target. Do not buy one till they fix the problems. It just does not work!"
4,Nice,I got this for Valentne's day. I like it. Its simple and easy to use. I used it for the first time almost all the kernels popped. Its a little noisy but over all a good product
2,Cute but avoid this stinker,"My gf loves popcorn so I was tasked to purchase her a replacement for her cheapo $10 air popper. I saw this one and thought ""what a great idea"" and bought it on the spot. I hadn't read the reviews here when I did my heart sank. Although some people ""did"" rate it high and said it was great. Sadly these may be closer to paid reviews because the consensus here seems to be true. Slow popping with small kernals. It makes a mess as well with kernels everywhere. If you like running through a batch of pops then do not look at this model. It's simply too slow and requires a ""breather"". It was returned yesterday."
4,"Great Product, But A Few Lows.","I love this product. It made excellent popcorn. It does not take up much space, and is a very, eye-catching piece for your home. It is not really unpracticle. Its just like a normal Hot Air popper, it just looks alot cooler than the other machines you see. There were a few lows with this product. There was a good number of kernals left over. The other major thing was, the 15 minute wait between popping. I would have taken more time on making this product, and somehow shorten that waiting period. The reason it is really not convenient is because the amount of kernals you are supposed to put in is only good for 1 person. So if you're making popcorn for more than one person, you can either wait 15 minutes between each popping, or use microwavable popcorn. Otherwise, this product is great, and I very much like it!!! I gave it 4/5 up there, but i would really rate it 3.5/5!!!"
1,This doesn't even deserve a star,"My husband bought me this for Christmas at Bed Bath and Beyond. At first the thing didn't work, then I stored it away for a few months and brought it back out thinking that I'd give it a second shot. Well, it worked good for a few weeks, it was popping most of the kernels and then it just stopped working again and was popping 20 kernels at the most (big waste of money on the machine and the kernels!) and now it just makes a humming noise when I turn it on. This product is definitely a big waste of money, and I agree with some of the others, it seems they only made this thing for looks, no thought went into popping the kernels. I think the buyers should get a refund for this product! So for all you who are thinking about this product, SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy a different brand!"
1,Deeply Unsatisfied,"So, I bought this during the Cyber Monday Sales as a Christmas Gift for my family-and the deal on this popcorn maker caught my eye. I was buying the family a new entertainment set for the living room and a few new movies and figured this nostalgic, Old-Fashioned looking popcorn maker would fit my running theme perfectly. When I tool it out and turned it on as a test drive, I immediately noticed that the fan tht should have circulated hot air was not running and that some of the decorative plastic fixtured appear to be loose. Honestly what is the use is a cheap looking popcorn maker that does not pop popcorn? No matter what the cost? Money is money and it is a tough economy. It seems to me that this item belong on the Islanf of Misfit Toys rather than in someone's Amazon Shopping Cart. Now I am dealing with the hassle of returning it, and hunting down a replacement two weeks before Christmas."
5,Pretty Cool!,"I bought this for my son's upcoming 1st birthday party and thought it would fit the circus theme. We tried it out immediately upon receipt. I put 3/4 of a cup in the reservoir and OMG popcorn galore!! Luckily I had 4 plastic popcorn containers (fit perfectly). Otherwise, there would have been popcorn everywhere. First, I put the popcorn in. Then I turned on the switch. Within 2-3 minutes it started popping. In all four containers, we had maybe 10 (total) whole kernels left, so it really did a great job popping almost all the popcorn. I bought some popcorn butter, white cheddar topping, and caramel + sea salt to try as toppings and the popcorn was DELICIOUS! Couldn't be happier with the purchase. I am also going to buy the cotton candy machine and possibly the hot dog cart."
1,Junk!!,"Saw this and thought that it was the cutest thing ever so we purchased it for our kids last Christmas. While it may look cute, it is a total piece of junk. They got 2 uses out of it and then it stopped working. Don't waste your money on this."
2,Too many unpopped kernels!,"I read the reviews here before I bought this and decided to take a chance. That was a mistake! I will be returning this to get my money back and buy a popper that actually works. Now I understand what people were saying about popcorn flying all over the room! Only about 1/3 of the kernels actually popped in the machine - the rest flew out unpopped. Some of them actually popped while they were in the bowl or on the counter - quite a sight! I don't know why this problem only affects some of the machines but if you have your heart set on buying this, be sure to keep the box it comes in. You might need it to take it back."
1,I blame the company,"I have called 3 times now because we unboxed this ""treasure"" and thew away the box and set it up for movie night. It has worked 1 time out of 10 so far. When it did work, yes it was as great as all the other reviewers said HORRIBLE! Refunds should be given to everyone who purchased this garbage! I have never received such bad customer service on an item in all my shopping years!!!!"
1,Noisy,"This machine takes too long to heat up and pop 20 kernels, it also makes a lot of noise. My kids and I were very disappointed. I am in the process of buying a simple one."
2,Short Life,"This hot air popper has a cool antique look, however it doesn't last longer than a year of so. It is noisy and can get quite hot. If you have the cash get a well-built unit, otherwise you will have purchased a conversation piece."
2,Don't bother,"Someone gave this to me as a present. It's cute but it does a terrible job of popping the popcorn. Most of your kernels just fly back out of the machine and into the bowl. On top of that, I have to hold a towel over half of the bowl while the machine is emptying because some of the kernels pop in the bottom of the bowl and send popcorn flying all over the place, wasting the little popcorn I actually get out of it."
1,Looks Cool and That's It,"It barely pops even half the kernels and like others have said, they end up EVERYWHERE. Try picking up scalding hot popcorn kernel duds with your bare hands. I cannot wait to get a new one and get this darn thing out of my kitchen. I received it as a gift or it would have been gone long ago. It's really big too, much bigger than a popcorn popper needs to be."
1,Horrible popcorn maker!,"The only thing this popcorn maker has going for it is being cute sitting on the counter. Forget about making popcorn with it. It does not stir the corn properly so the kernels tend to burn instead of popping and then when they finally pop, they get all blocked up in the container and don't want to come out into the bowl. PLUS, the motor on mine burned out after only a few uses. Buy the Orville Redenbacher instead if you actually want to make popcorn with your machine."
3,Acceptable,"I like it. I love air popped popcorn, and it worked well. The popcorn to unpopped kernels ration was like 5:1... about what you get with microwave popcorn, only it never gets burnt. It's loud, but that's what you get with air-pop.The ""popcorn flying out of the bowl"" thing happens once or twice a popping, and is more annoying than anything. It's not a super stellar product, but it's also not the horrible child killing product some people seem to think it is."
3,Decent...,"I was put off by the 15 minute wait between pops, but was happy with it till the 5th use and the popcorn burnt inside it and smoked up my house. Going to TRY to return or exchange it...we'll see. Best of luck if you're interested in this machine."
2,"Looks cute, poorly engineered.","Out of the approximately 1/2c of popcorn called for, 1/3c were unpopped and 1/2 of those were all over the floor. Waste of money unless you just want it for decoration."
1,JUNK,How would you feel about something that made you ill? When I took the popper out of the box I read all the directions about cleaning it and how to proceed with popping corn. I cleaned it and plugged it in. Then I turned it on and began to wait the required two minutes. After about a minute thick black smoke came billowing out of it. Since I was standing right next to it the toxic mess was inhaled as I reached to unplug it and turn on the exhaust fan. I ended up with a respiratory problem and asthma attack. It was cute and the person I gave it to as a gift loved it - until it almost burned down the house and filled our home with noxious smoke. Amazon as always refunded my money when I returned it. It was a piece of junk.
2,came broken,Product pops the kernals still but when we took it out of the box the whole top lid was broken and cracked. I was upset because it was my husbands christmas gift and we had family over and he wanted to use it so bad.
2,Very very loud and low quality Chinese construction,"This is an air popper disguised as an old time popcorn machine. Constructions is poor, and it is very very loud daughter was a little disappointed. Popcorn does not pop very well either I would not recommend."
1,Piece of Junk,"One of the sorriest pieces of junk I've bought in a long time. Never worked right and was dead after less than a half dozen uses. Bought it for wife as Christmas present, Didn't last till Valentines Day. Threw it in trash!Bought a Presto popper for less than half the price. Not as cute, but it works!!"
1,Less than one star.,"I mistakenly purchased one of these at a local store before reading the reviews. I agree with everyone else, it throws unpopped kernels around and does a poor job of popping a useable quantity of corn."
1,Waste of Money,"There is no practical reason for buying this product unless you simply want to display it.It pops poorly and it does not pop enough for two people. It will pop about 1/4 (one quarter) of the kernals you put in.Up there with my list of ""worst christmas gift ever""."
1,Simple system but unfunctional,"Its a great design, but it really doesn't work at all. I bought one, and the heat works well but the fan didn't work at all, so the popcorn never popped. I don't recomend it at all."
2,flimsy,Got this for our bar in our finished basement. Its a great and healthy) option for our kids who eat popcorn all the time! it wasn't very sturdy though. It i assume was damaged in shipping..... All plastic parts! we would rather pay a bit more and upgrade to a metal one. Much sturdier!!
1,A Waste Of Money,"The first day i got this item i was really excited. When i opened the box it look so cool. i used fresh popcorn and i got about fifteen pieces of popcorn and loads of kernals. All the popcorn got stuck in the chute and the kernals were all burned. Its a total waste of money, so i don't recommend this item."
1,waste of money,"I have used my Movietime Popcorn Popper and well, I wish I could send it back. First the instruction manul claims that it pops more kernels that other popcorn makers if this is true I'm going back to microwave popcorn. I found nearly half the kernels went unpopped.Q:would i Reccomend this produt to someone?A: NO!"
1,Don't buy this popper,"I've purchased numerous items from Amazon over the years and never received a product of such poor quality as this was. Popper burned its first batch and I had to scrape out all the burned kernels from inside the popping chamber. I tried a second batch (after reading instructions to heat for 2 minutes before adding popcorn) which also burned. Popper had smoke coming out the sides. Needless to say, this is being returned. While this machine may look ""cute"", don't be fooled into buying it. It's very poor quality."
5,Great for price,"We bought this for the office & it works great. It's cute and does what it's suppose to do. Great buy for that price. I dont see any issues with it at all. I dont know what people expect from a $29 machine. Follow the instructions on the provided manual & you wont have any isses.. If you do, contact Amazon as their return policy is great. Also- its a healthy snack."
3,"Love the look, but.....","It looks great, but is VERY loud when you are actually using it. As far as how it pops, it's ok but not as good as I expected. There are always popcorn kernels left in it."
1,What a JOKE!,"This popcorn popper looks neat and thats it. Don't waste your money unless you want it for decoration. It makes a mess with the popcorn blowing out. It leaves a lot of seeds in your bowl that gets thrown away, and a small amount of popcorn to eat. Most families would need to make several batches but you have to wait 15 minutes before you can make a new batch. LOOK FOR ANOTHER POPPER!"
1,This Popcorn Popper is Possessed!,"I bought this popcorn popper for my parents as a gift. They hated it and so did everyone else that witnessed it's performance. We all concluded it is possessed. First of all, it left at least half of the popcorn kernels unpopped everytime, which was very disappointing. I know this is not due to the quality of the popcorn because I have successfully popped the same brand of popcorn in my own popper (different brand popper) at home with great results everytime. Second, this popper is not safe. Hot kernels come flying out in all directions and burst outside of the popper becoming a hazard for anyone who is within a few feet of it. Although the design is charming, please do not let it fool you. My parents insisted I return the gift."
1,"CUTE HOT AIR POPPER, BUT I'M RETURNING IT","The inexpensive price and visual appeal of this hot air popper was enough to make me purchase. Wish I read the reviews on this site first. I agree with all those folks who were unhappy with the performance of this appliance, and I am sorry to say that I had similar experiences. Just about as many corn kernels spit out of the machine unpopped as popped, many ending up on the counter or the floor -- and it took a very long time to get really just a handful or two of popcorn. I am returning it for a refund in the morning. Very disappointed in the product. This is certainly one more example of why its important not to judge a book by its cover."
4,A Great Industrail/Noize CD,THis cd for some reason stand out from a lot of industral cds out there. It has a unique and original sound unlike others. But it still feel underdevelop but its' still a very good cd.
5,Extremely informative,"Although I am only in Latin III in high school, this book has given me an edge over the class. It contains important historical dates, the declensions (although in a somewhat odd order), conjugations, almost every Latin word known to man (even the ones my teacher can't pronounce), and some of the more famous Romans in mythology and real life. If you want a clear, concise, portable Latin dictionary, look no further than this."
4,Pocket Latin Dictionary an Adequate Quick Reference Guide,"Collins' thick, pocket dictionary (Latin to English, English to Latin) is an adequate reference for beginning to intermediate Latin. It includes sections on pronunciation and grammar, as well as brief lists of numbers, months and days, measures, historic Roman dates, money, and geographical names. Approximately 3 x 4 x 1 1/2""."
5,excellent value,"Such a wealth of information in such a portable size. It's very nice to see that this 2nd edition has corrections of some minor errors from the 1st (I still have that one, bought for Latin class a few decades ago), such as a ""habemamini"" in the conjugation tables now being the correct ""habebamini"", and the gender of the noun ""mare"" now given correctly. But they still don't show the long vowels in the tables for the perfect subjunctive active, which would have been handy for distinguishing some of those from the corresponding future-perfect indicative active forms. Anyhow, the main thing is the very well-chosen entry words, many with typical idiomatic phrases included. This little dictionary is a *great* value."
4,Excellent for what it is....,"This book is a great miniature lexicon for those who need a quick and physically handy reference for Latin. It goes beyond the ""basics"" and is adequate for more advanced perusal. However, the book _is_ printed on a type of ""pulp paper"" and its pages are merely ""glued in"" (so-call ""perfect binding"").All things considered, for the money, it is a bargain and you can't go wrong."
5,Complete Knowledge !,In that dictionary it has the complete knowledge. And it is a good compact dictionary for the beginners and the expert !
5,THE BEST CD-R'S THEIR IS,THESE SAMSUNG CD-R'S ARE EXCELLENT QUALITY. THEY NEVER HAVE A BAD BURN NEVER.THE MUSIC PLAYBACK ON THESE CD-R'S ARE AWESOME. THEY ARE THE BEST YOU CAN GET. THEY ARE ALOT BETTER THAN MAXELL PRO READ MY REVIEW OF MY PROBLEMS WITH MAXELL PRO. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT DONT KNOW WHY ALL THE BAD REVIEWS BECAUSE I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THESE CD-R'S.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I burn a lot of CDs. A LOT. I don't like to take my ""real"" CDs in my car or to work, so I'm always burning mixes to listen to while I drive or in my office. So far, I've tried 3 of these discs, and 2 of them were coasters! I usually buy 25 or 50 pack spindles and use Fujis (the ones made in Japan) or Maxell Pros, but I have used everything from Memorex to Office Depot brand and have NEVER had 2 coasters in a pack, let alone a pack of 10!"
3,CD-R's,Cd-r's are fine. The shipping costs doubled the price of the product. I will not buy from the vendor again.
3,Huh?,"I like that you get both walkthroughs in one book it makes it easier than having to go out & look for 2 seperate books.The only thing Im not 100% happy with is that the maps in the back of the book are not complete, they are cut off around the whole edge of the map on all maps! How frustrating is that?Another thing is that a section in the map drastically changes after you acomplish a part in the game. So there is no before picture which really confuses the heck out of you if you have not got there or you are on your way.Links Awakening walkthrough book for Gameboy Color is a much better book if you have already played that one. It is diplayed in better understanding & has the whole map that is folded in the book(which you can take out & unfold). Also every chapter shows a section of the map you should stay in while working on defeating that level.The games are fun regardless though, they just needed to have a proper walkthrough book."
2,leaves out many areas found in other books/online,"This version of the Zelda guide book is the worst I've seen so far.In the ""item index,"" key items (like weapons) are mislabeled or completely left out. And there's almost no information about linked games, and with its awful layout, you have search through pages to find the one instruction your looking for.My suggestion is to go to GameFaqs and print out one from there, or get a different guide.Stay away from this one at all costs"
2,Serious Errors in the Ages Section,"I can only speak about the AGES guide. I found serious errors and mis-information starting at level 6. There are things omitted, erroneous, or out of sequence that leave you high and dry in the game. This also happened at level 7. (I have not yet moved to level 8.) I had to rely on web site guides to get me out of trouble. Use caution with this book! If you don't have access to other guides or friends who played the game, don't buy it for the AGES game. I don't know about any other guide books since this is the one I picked based on the other reviews. (I wonder if the other reviews are bogus! You can't finish the game with these errors!)"
3,Blue and the Gray Recut version,I will admit that I didn't understand what the Recut version was. It was purchased to use in my class at school. It will be OK for that; but it leaves out some integral parts if you want to understand the whole story line. I wouldn't recommend it is you want the whole story behind the characters and not just the basic Civil War battle portrayals.
1,Warning: this recut is very good.,I am disappointed with this version. The first time watching I noted too many scenes missing from the original VHS copy. I should have spent a little more on the uncut edition.
2,Blue and gray,this is the second dvd I have bought and cannot ply because it is in a difent zone. Not for europe.disappointed and concerned I may purchase other porducts and find the same. Until now I guess I have been lucky
4,"Quick Shipment, But DVD Froze While Watching",I bought this video to show in my classroom and knew it was used but did not expect it to completely freeze up several times and it always seemed to happen at the most intense times. I was pleased with the company other than this. Very quick shipment!!!
3,Not very realistic,"A good miniserie but we could regret a lack of historical reality, i.e it is a story with the civil war as a background (only some aspects : not a word about Robert E. Lee, about slavery...), and not the civil war history lived by some characters. I would recomend to watch ""North and South"" which, despite a very much romanced story, has a much stronger historical background."
2,Disappointed,"I recently purchased this video based on a review. I was extremely disappointed. Most of us civil war buffs are looking for authenticity--in uniforms, mannerisms, accents, military equipment, etc. This movie did not have it. Although scenes are taking place at major battles, (Bull Run, Shiloh) there is never shown more than 30-40 men engaged in conflict at a time. Totally unrealistic. Your money is much better spent on ""Gettysburg"" and ""Glory""."
2,Worst Civil War Miniseries Ever Made,"You can tell by the lousy acting that this was a ""made for television"" Civil War miniseries. The action sequences will remind you of the era of shows like the Dukes of Hazzard or Chips. The acting is terrible and the uniforms do not look authentic. Please do not buy this set without borrowing it from your local library first or you'll be disappointed. Now, good or bad a review is a review. These are opinions. Notice that everyone who liked the movie on this list of reviews got mostly a ""helpful"" comment on their review and those who didn't like it got a majority of ""unhelpful"" reviews. If a movie isn't worth watching or buying I'd like someone to tell me!"
2,recut to pieces,The recut version is choppy. All the scenes that are necessary for character development have been removed. I bought this by mistake when I meant to buy the full version. Don't waste your money! Get the full version. It's a wonderful mini-series in its original version.
1,A travesty!,"I saw the word ""recut"" and I was severely disappointed to find a watered down version (literally and figuratively) of this fascinating piece. Not only is there no information to warn you of the severe deletions of this version, but the video quality does not come close to the 3 DVD set FULL/Complete miniseries set. Avoid this version (unless you find it in the bargain bin at Wal Mart) at all costs. C'mon what is ""The Blue and the Gray"" WITHOUT the duel scene between John Geyser and the German debutante?"
1,why did this cut down junk even get released,a stunning waste of a good movie. cut by some 2 hours or more this is just a pure waste of time and disc when the complete miniseries is out there to be had . this is just junk!!!!!
4,I like it!,I'm a re-enactor and I watched this miniseries. It isn't very authentic but I like the storys and the actors are good. For colectors of civil-war-movies it does not missing !!
1,"Sad, sad story, poorly told","This was a sad attempt to show the War Between the States. Poorly told, poorly acted, it was an attempt to justify the Union's invasion of the South as something noble. The bravery of the Federal Army with four times the number of men as the Confederacy is never brought to one's attention, and the slaughter the Union inflicted upon the people, the land, and the economy of the South is down played to an extreme. Union traitors, spy's and soldiers are glorified while Southern soldiers are nasty folks who were doomed to failure. After you've seen the film Gettysburg you'll have an idea of why this war was fought and how wrong a war it was. The miniseries of The Blue and the Grey fails to show the truth about this horrible war."
4,The Blue and Gray enjoyable movie,"The movie The Blue and The Gray comes with three discs. The movie is over 6 hrs so we watched it in sections - a disc a night. The only problem we had was on the third disc it hung up mid way but finally got going again. The sound was lost so we had to pause and then the sound came back. We just backed it up to where the mess up was and it was fine. The movie itself was enjoyable and concentrated more on the personal aspects of the war instead of on so much fighting. There are some battle scenes, but that is not the major content of the movie. Anyone who is a Civil War fan should enjoy watching this."
4,The Blue and the Gray - Recut,We already had this series film on video and wanted to update to a dvd. The re-cut version is very good.
4,Gift for my father,My father loved the Mini-Series when it was originally shown and loved the books.Purchased him a new DVD player and added a few movies to the package. He was pleased and enjoyed being able to see the series again.
1,WOW when they say Recut they really mean CUT,"The Marketing of this DVD set is so deceiving. I was thrilled when I saw a new recut version, thinking that there would be deleted scenes, maybe an alterante ending, you know, all those extra goodies. They should have called this the CUT TO SHREDS VERSION because they lopped off two hours of footage and this version is just a chopped up MESS. I returned my set and I advise others to do so also"
5,This one turned me into a Civil War buff,"Ok, some of the reviews complain that there is some historically inaccurate things like the wrong battle flag or something. So what? Most of us farbies dont know the difference anyways. This is a highly entertaining movie that I have watched several times. No, you are not getting an in depth treatment of any particular battle, but an overview of the entire war from John Browns hanging to Lincolns assaination. There are many memorable scenes like the use of hot air balloons to spy on the other side, the trading of supplies between the blue boys and the gray boys by using a toy sailboat, and Stacey Keach riding across the battlefield at Gettysburgh that is littered with hundreds of bodies as the Gettysburgh address is read by Gregory Peck's Lincoln. Speaking of which, Peck gives the best portrayal of Lincoln that I have ever seen. Worthwhile viewing and a personal favorite of mine."
5,Excellent for classroom use,"The Blue and the Gray is an excellent resource for students to study the Civil War period, especially middle school students. It is suggested, however, that students view the film after a study of the war, since the film doesn't specifically mention several specific sites/events, as would a documentary. The film is excellent in that the tale is centered on a young Virginia correspondent (John Geyser) who attempts to remain neutral, while the rest of his extended family in both the North and the South are engaged in fighting the war. In fact, they may have even shot at and killed family members. the film shows how the war affects John's immediate family, friends, and acquaintances. It depicts camp life, as well as major events of the war. And, yes, it has its lighter moments, which kids will appreciate."
3,Flawed But Worthy,"I've never seen ""The Blue and the Gray"" miniseries until now- and I'm 52 years old (better late than never!). Overall it was very enjoyable. The costumes were great- although I too noticed that the hair styles were often modern. I'm a descendent of 20 Civil War soldiers (both sides)-so I have a particular interest in the period. Of course, I loved the miltary scenes- which were done well. The historical sequences were not always accurate- but that was okay too. The series was loaded with stars- many of whom are now passed away. Gregory Peck was great as Lincoln. However, I have to say that I thought some of the acting of others seemed sub par. At times, I felt like I was watching a high school play. There were too many predictable elements as well- you just knew that Julia Duffy's character was going to die. In summary, it is worth watching despite some of the things mentioned."
4,The Blue and the Gray,Like Stacy Keach. Good Acting through out the series.Stacy Keach can make anyone believe that he is a clairvoyant union officer hunting down a mentally deranged confederate officer portrayed by Warren Oates. It branches out and gets into the split in the family of a young journalist who goes north and leaves behind his southern family. It's a greatstory.
2,"Very, Very Blue","Sorry, I'm more of an action viewer. It broke my heart to hear the Gettysburg address and not see any of the battle. The series teases you by placing the setting in Gettysburg, yet no emphasis was place on one of the most historic battles in American history. Stick to Ted Turner's ""Gettysburg"" if you like action."
1,Disappointing,"It seems as if this film was put together on the spur of the moment, absolutly no continuity at all. The scenery is good and that's about all. Save your money and get ""North and South"" if you want an excellent Civil War film."
3,Went thru this movie,"Some horrible scenes but ok to fill time. An ok hangover film or to put wall paper on your large screen. Stacy Keach is the highlight from when he was quite a guy. The young actors sometimes fail to perform much at all. The reenactors are obviously there and it is good due to that as it shows reenacting and not a genuine CW experience. The newer Gods and Generals and Gettysburg are well done in comparison to this even more dated film.The renactments look like they were performed in a barn with scenery and the re-enactors are limited in numbers. Bullrun looks like a barn dance with guns as brigades are represented by about 10 guys. Some of the cannon look simply silly supported by a ""regiment"" that has about twice as many men as the gun crew of the obviously phony cannon with small charges and little or no recoil. STILL, it is ok as a CW chick flick."
2,Corny but watchable,"OK people. No way could this be rated five stars. Anyone who did is way to easy to please. I watched the whole thing and thank god I had a fast forward button that was used quite often. The whole war seemed to be fought by 50 of the same people. Uniforms were ridiculous. Gregory peck should be ashamed, though he did a splendid job of acting the script was un-believable. Stacy keach did a great job of acting. The Geyser family did not make you feel like they were a real family. This really took away from the reality of the whole mess. Again, I watched it. I will never watch it again so Im going to sell this. I made the mistake of watching Maxwells Gettysburg and God and Generals. Those were the BEST EVER MADE SO FAR! All other movies cant compare to those. Blue and Grey is a joke compared to them. Now that I think about it. I really should have given this series one star. Sorry but it was corny as hell."
5,loads of fun,"My wife read about this game in a magazine and we took a chance on it - so glad we did. Very easy to pick up and start playing right away, you can set the length of the game, and games are almost always close. Also, it was nice to have a game meant for 2 players; many that we had seen lately are optimized for 3 or more. I highly recommend this game."
4,Got 15min to kill? Play this game!,"My wife and I have had this game for a month and we've really enjoyed it. When we play we usually play for a certain amount of time. There is definitely some strategy involved, mostly consisting of not discarding cards your opponent could use. I think this game would be a great tool for learning addition, subtraction, multiplication and could be a good step up for children who don't want to play a ""little kid"" looking game. I do recommend using something as a player turn token, especially if you are doing something else while playing."
4,fun game,"This is a pretty fun game. Simple to learn, and seems rather basic at first, but the more you play the more strategy there is."
3,Cool game for a rainy day.,"This game is okay, I wouldn't say it was the best every, but worth the money I spent on it. It is good for 2 players."
2,Ho Hum,I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. It's a good looking card game but the only challenge is in the complicated math required to figure out your score.
2,Lost Cities,"I normally do my research on boardgames before I buy them. As such, I watched a couple of reviews on youtube and comparative ""best Board Games"" lists online.Why buy this game? I didn't. I just use a deck of cards and change the starting investment to -25 per suit. Works like a dream. Save some money."
5,Simple rules; intriguing game!,"The best games are those with just a few simple rules, but with a large number of decision-based variations. This game fills the bill marvelously."
3,"Easy to learn, not that fun.","Don't know why everyone loves it. It is easy to learn, and quick to play, but after 3 games, it gets very tired. It did come in good condition and on time. I would not recommend it."
4,Game for two,"Its so hard to find games for only two people. This is a fun game that involves some strategy, but not so much that you can't drink during the game. It does get a little repetitive after a few rounds."
4,Enjoyable game,A 2 person game that my husband and I enjoy playing over dinner. It's not so challenging as some games but not mindless either. We can play a couple games relatively fast.
4,Pretty fun game for two people.,"Pretty fun, not quite as challenging as I would have liked. But a good game for two people, which are hard to find. Arrived quickly, too."
4,More challenging than you expect,"My wife and I very much enjoy Lost Cities. The rules are simple and we had them nailed in one game, but planning out your strategy is very challenging."
5,Great gateway game for non-gamers,"If you know someone who thinks tabletop gaming means Monopoly and Sorry, this is a great way to introduce them to good board games. The rules are simple and can be mastered the first round, and the whole session is under thirty minutes. There are no timers or lists to memorize, so there is very little pressure to hurry. Also, most of the game mechanics are exposed - you hide no cards except your own hand. It also helps that the illustrations are pretty.My wife loves this game and I'll introduce her soon to Ticket to Ride, then Carcassone."
5,great 2 person travel game,"This is a great little game for two people to play while traveling. It's just a pack of cards (it comes with a board, but you don't need it to play). There's lots of luck involved, but without good strategy you won't win.The crux of the game is to build up suits of cards from lower to higher, choosing which cards to play and which to discard. By playing up suits of cards, you earn points, but if you commit to a suit too early, and don't make the minimum points, you'll get a negative score.Discarding can be problematic, too, as discarded cards are available to the other player.Extra point bonuses come from investment cards, and building long suits.I highly recommend this for older children and adults. There are few good two person strategy games on the market-- this is one of them."
4,I lose track of time,"The game is so intriging. Notice I did not say addictive. I can stop playing this game anytime I want to. I'm just not ready to stop playing it. Truth be told, I am not very good at Lost Cities. I cannot hide my feelings and you need a poker face for this game. Although I have never won it does not stop me from trying to win. The game is super simple but so compelling."
4,Great two player game,"This game is great for two players. It was a good level of sophistication and strategy, without being cumbersome or difficult to learn. Some math is required to tabulate the final score, but nothing too strenuous. The art on the cards is very enjoyable to look at, especially how they progress to tell a story of exploration."
5,Lost Cities,Love the game. Been sharing it with family members. This is the third one ordered and it came within a week of my ordering it.
3,Could be done with a few decks of cards,"The game has replay value but could easily be done if you have a few decks of cards. The ""quests"" have no story or purpose, other than to match the colors try and get as many points on each quest as possible. I paid around $17 for it and feel a little ripped off, since you don't really even need the board to play the game and it could have easily come in less packaging. Concept is easy to understand and is a good way to pass some time and spark some competitiveness amongst friends or couples."
2,falls off,"It protects the camera only when it is attached. This film makes bubbles and comes off at the edges, making the screen look dirty and unprotected at the edges."
3,Great Style with a Poor Finish,"I purchased this for a powder room pedestal sink that gets little use. I love the style, but the finish already had a pitted spot that is only going to grow. Guess the price really was too good to be true."
1,Don't bother buying this product,"This is the worst software package I've ever purchased, bar none. Check out the support sections of their web site to understand why I am saying that. Not only does it not work, it locks up Word and the entire PC until you reboot. Need proof? Check out their web site. You'll wait 4-6 weeks for a refund. Remember, you were warned."
1,RoboPDF,"I purchased this product in February 2004 and it was discontinued in August 2004. The product is not compatible with Windows XP Service Pack 2. Now that I have upgraded Windows, I can no longer use the product and the manufacturer will not support it."
1,a book written for academic linguists,"...with no support for lay persons interested in the variations of Spanish.I struggled along waiting for the ""meat"" until the author mentioned el cinco de mayo as being ""Mexico's Independence Day"" --at which point she lost the credibility she'd devoted so much of the book trying to establish."
3,Typical Insecure Woman Romance,"I read a lot of books and enjoy romance novels, BUT I am so so tired of the scenario of the beautiful, talented yet terribly insecure woman. Can't an alpha male fall in love with a secure woman?Nia is so insecure she is bossed around by her friends and family, boyfriend, and his friends and family. Give me a break. Give me a reason to connect with her or even like her. I also didn't like how Damon treated her. He lied to her, allowed his family to attack her, and was mad when she didn't want to fight with his (always present) ex-girlfriend. When she FINALLY decides that she has had enough (in the typical ""not what it seems like"" scenario with always present ex-girlfriend), her family and his family berate her for her lack of trust!Too sum it up, it was too typical. I'll have to continue my search for an atypical romance novel with a secure strong female character. Wish me luck!"
5,"This is a very relaxing form of music, beatifully done.","This is a very relaxing CD to relieve stress as it provides the most lovely bird songs against a background of soft music and water sounds. There are no artificial sounds to interfer with the mood. I put this CD on ""repeat"" and let it fill my house for hours. It is well-done, and I highly recommend it."
5,Wonderful Singing Birds CD!,I had to rehome my parakeets when my kitty Richie grew into an avid hunter in order to protect the lives of the birds... the house was quiet as a tomb. I got this CD and put it on the CD player by day to fill the quiet as my parakeets were a SINGING flock and filled the house with their song when I had them. This made the loss of rehoming the parakeets a bit more bearable as the house was no longer too quiet. GREAT CD.
1,"....Y como dijo la cancion, ""POR QUE?""","Este cd contiene canciones NO EN SU ESTADO ORIGINAL DE GRABACION POR LOS ORIGINALES ARTISTAS. No ay como las canciones viejitas pero con el sonido original. Desafortunadamente, este cd no es asi.....Bueno, pues ya minimo aprovecho para saludar a mis parientes alla en VICTORIA DE CORTAZAR, GUANAJUATO desde aqui, CHICAGO......SALUDOS!!! ~DJ LUPE AYALA"
3,"Disappointing, not what I expected","The description of this book states it's for parents ""whether they sobered up last year or 15 years ago"".The introduction says it will address families whose children were not affected by the addiction as well as those who were. It doesn't.I got this book in the hopes it would help me with whether and how to talk to my kids about my addiction. It didn't.I've been clean and sober for 15 years now and it's time to talk to my preteen kids before they get into the same trouble I did. Unfortunately this book focuses only on parents whose kids have suffered due to their addictions and not at all on those whose addictions predate their kids.It may be a good book for some, but it wasn't at all what I was looking for."
4,evan parker,Product arrived in expected condition. Music is evant garde. Interesting cover design. Not sure where the title of the album came from. It was a re issue of July 1970 recording. early in the artist career.
2,Typical.,"As previous reviews have mentioned, Everything For Sale is little more than typical leftist diatribe packaged in muddled economics. William Grieder's One World, Ready of Not makes the same type of arguments but at least provides keener examples. If you want to read this stuff, go with Grieder's book. While it's reasoning is just as muddled, it does provide hundreds of colorful stories that are worth hearing. If all you want is the diatribe, you're better off saving your money and buying a copy of Adbusters magazine, which is cheaper."
2,Who does he think he is? William Greider?,"A tepid defense of the new Robert Rubin/George Soros style of capitalism. Kuttner tries to balance the need of liberals to get filthy rich but also to pay token respect to antitrust, regulation, and the poor. His idea that market economics can work with restraints is ultimately unworkable; the restraints he sees as good stifle experimentation and promulgate the welfare state."
3,Image Quality Disappointing,"I loved the Royal Wedding, it was magical and beautiful. I watched it on TLC (in America, obviously) and it was in HD and the picture quality was outstanding, felt as if I were actually there. The only thing that bothered me about TLC was the commercials and the constant babble about the wedding dress. I decided to order the BBC DVD so I could have an uninterrupted version of the ceremony, but the image quality of the DVD is terrible. It's not in HD."
5,Wonderful gift!,This item was for a gift for one of my closest friends. She loves this type of thing and the dvd is perfect for anyone interested in this sort of thing! Lovely dvd and arrived SO fast! Was able to wrap it early!
4,The Wedding...Finally!,"Due to the tornados that ripped through Alabama on April 29th, we were without power for five days. I had been looking forward to the royal wedding but missed seeing it because of our powerless cableless condition. I was glad to be here so no complaints!! I was happy to find the dvd of the wedding at a very reasonable price on Amazon. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the whole BBC coverage. The DVD was beautifully done and who could have any complaints about this nice young couple! I hope they are a fairy tale come true!"
5,WHAT A WONDERFUL ROYAL WEDDING!!!!,"WHAT A WONDERFIL ROYAL WEDDING!!!!! I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE DVD'S FROM AMAZON.ONE FOR MY SISTER AND ONE FOR ME.WE ARE NOT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS DVD.WE BOTH ENJOYED THE WEDDING AND AREN'T SORRY THAT WE HAVE THIS MOVIE. THE PRINCESS LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THE PRINCE LOOKED SO HANDSOME AS WELL. IF YOU BUY THIS DVD YOU WON'T BE SORRY EITHER. IT WAS SO GREAT. YOU WILL ENJOY THIS ONE FOR SURE!!!!!!"
5,Terrific in every sense,I can watch this splendid dvd over and over again relieving the fairy tale wedding of Englands Prince William and his Duchess Catherine!
5,Royals,Received the DVD in great condition and very promptly. Haven't opened it so can't comment on the quality of the DVD.
1,DVD quality was awful,"The DVD quality was awful. It began wih five to ten minutes of advertising. The DVD did not play after ten minutes, on any of my DVD players, TV, desk top, lap top and DVD player. Shame on BBC for selling such shabby material. I am VERY, VERY disappointed, I so looked forward to this. I would like a replacement, does anyone know who I can contact???. It would have been good, had I been able to look at it. I am still in unbelief at the quality of the DVD, and the fact that it stopped playing after a few minutes. It never got to seeing the bride out of her car!!!. I am disappointed!."
3,Not As Expected,"I was really looking fwd to receiving this. For over a month I had planned to create my on DVD copy of the coverage of the day. Unfortunately, the tornadoes of April 27 left the northern third of our state (AL) without power until the next week. So I really wanted this to be good. But, the coverage was boring. I am hoping that someone can tell me where to get a dvd memory of the day that is done by ABC, E channel, FOX, or some other quality form of media."
1,Really? Maybe there's more to it...,"At the dawn of the 21st century some of us [too many, unfortunately] still revere monarchy and implicitly what it stands for, and the fortunes they amassed throughout the years by means of colonization, slavery, genocide, religious conversion, etc.We are on the brink of spoiling our planet of vital natural resources, yet we watch in awe a luxurious, over the top, glamorous wedding, while at the same time, thousands of children die of hunger and disease caused mainly by centuries of said colonialism and enslavement.Just think about it for a minute. ;)"
3,Disappointed,"I had seen the BBCA Highlights of the Wedding...I was hoping the DVD would add the Drive-Away with the Astin Martin and add the view of her father lifting her veil...it did neither...otherwise it was a lovely DVD of the wedding starting with Wills leaving his father's house and ending with ""the kisses""...just wished it was more complete..."
2,Disappointing,"BBC coverage was the best; however, too much was deleted causing hiccups in the sound especially during wedding ceremony--very disappointed."
4,"OK, but where is the blu-ray?","This is a good DVD rendition of the event, but not as good as the HiDef TV broadcast. These pictures are not crystal clear. The sound is only 2 channels. Why can't somebody release a true HiDef, widescreen, 5.1 DTS Blu-Ray?"
5,"BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL",I wayched the wedding at 3am the morning of April 29th. it is a perfect commerative to play over and over for kids and grandkids(even though i have neither)It is a perfect way to remember that beautiful morning.
5,Delighted,"I was happy to see it arrive in perfect shape and to receive my product in same condition. Happy, happy. No complaints :)"
1,The only thing i can say about this one is that it was fast delivery,BUT the lotion itself has absolutely NO smell whatsoever not to mention it was super watery! If you are looking for lotion that smells good this is not the one! This will be retturned!
3,Electric Heated Chip and Dip,It was ok but I had been looking for the Deni brand and I thought it was like the one I had previously purchased. I gave it as a gift and told them I would return it if it was not big enough. It was much smaller than the Deni one that I had given her mother. She said it was fine for just her and her husband. I wish I could find another Deni one like I had previously purchased and actually I had previously ordered to Deni brand as gifts and they love them.
5,Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas,"I watched this movie with my son when he was little and we both loved it. Unfortunatly he was so little that he doesn't remember it anymore. He's 16 now. And now, I want it so he can share it with his two little sisters aged 3 and 5. GREAT MOVIE!"
5,A film that has captured the heart of the season!,"Ever since I was a young boy, I awaited Christmas for many reasons. The greatest reason was simply the celebration of the season and the celebration of it's true meaning. The heart of this meaning is found in this little movie. It warms me to even think of it! How I wish I could escape to a little hollow were everyone knows everybody else- and the worse society has to offer is a band of young people who turn out not to be too bad at all. It is a great escape. As chuck would say, ""I didn't love it- I LOOOOOOOVED it!"" Check Chuck, me too!"
3,"""Nobody wants to oil a snake""","A classic christmas program from Jim Henson's Muppets. I taped from TV a long time ago, but that tape broke. I bought it on VHS and was shocked that Kermit's closing remarks weren't there! Also, Alice Otter and Gretchen Fox's scece was shorterned. It was a great TV special, but the VHS doesn't compare."
3,Another voice,"Let me add my voice to the chorus of people who were disappointed by the video/DVD version of Emmet Otter's Jug Band Christmas. There may have been two versions of it floating around out there, but most of us seem to remember the same one. Since THAT version isn't available, I would reccomend this DVD; it may not be what I remember (or wanted!) but it's still entertaining."
2,"Yes, it's a classic but......",I got this video for Christmas a couple of years ago and was sooooooo thrilled! BUT..... some of the best scenes were cut out! I have a hard time watching it now because I know what is missing. If you have never seen it before it will become a family favorite!
5,Want to feel like a kid again for a little while?,"Then buy this video! My sis ter and I remember this video fondly from when we were younger. In fact, she goes around the house singing songs from this movie every holiday season. Just goes to show you what an impact a movie released in 1977 can have on a kid. All we can say is this.....if you want a movie that is sure to become a tradition around your household, then buy this one. It is sure to be remembered among the greats such as ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""Rudolph"". Two otter tails up for this heart-warming and funny flick. I must-see for kids of all ages!"
5,A tradition in my family!,"This is the most touching addaptation of the ""Gift of the Magi"" that I have ever seen. Masterfully created by Jim Henson (and featuring Kermit the Frog), this story will touch everyone who sees it with it's characters, messages, music and humor. It is visually STUNNING and truly brings the spirit of Christmas home."
2,Disappointed in Editing,"I was going to buy this finally-released video, but when I read the reviews and found all of them said the same thing - that the original Emmet Otter had been edited from what we remember it as being, I backed out of it. I, too, have an old copy taped off air about 20 years ago, and that (original) version will just have to suffice for a few more years. When Emmet Otter's Jug Band Christmas is released in it's original form, then I will gladly pay to add it to my collection."
2,SImply the best holiday show!,This is just the best of all the holiday shows! I have awaited seeing it on TV every year since I was 7 and I am 27 now with children of my own! Jim Henson was a genius and he will live on with this being one of his best works... Happy holidays!
2,Disappointment!,"Before buying this DVD I read the reviews and all of them seemed to be real good (4 or 5 stars). Now I see quite a few reviews much lower and I must agree. I wasted my money on this purchase. The quality of this effort reminds me of the early days of TV when puppet shows and cooking shows were about all you could call entertainment. Although the show was ""cute"" it was not anywhere near the quality of other Muppet features. If you want a good, really good Muppet Christmas flick then I would recommend ""The Muppet Christmas Carol""."
2,Not happy..,"The quality of this dvd was so bad that I purchased a new one from walmart to compare. Not only was the picture quality bad and blurry, but the sound quality was even worse it almost appeared as if it were recorded from a VHS tape. Every time the music started for emmit or his mother to sing, the music would sound but the singing voices lowered. You could only hear the music and and very little to no voices...nothing wrong with my equiptment, I own a state of the art system and tried every adustment to my equiptment and television before writing this review. In conclusion, the dvd is totally useless and a real dissapointment. I gave it two stars only because it was shipped and arrived promptly."
3,They should be required to indicate that it has been edited,"This was one of my favorite Muppets features ever since the first time I saw it on HBO. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have indicated, this version has been clumsily edited and I was very disappointed in the changes. Kermit's narration has been removed, the ending is changed, and some of the lyrics of the songs are redone. The Muppets features always showed the whole range of emotions, from sentimentality to honest anger and a little cartoonish violence. These things have all been removed from the film. I am not sure if the changes were made to ""sanitize"" this for kids, or if it was just cut for time reasons, but the changes make no sense and really cut the heart out of the film. Save your money until they release the original HBO special."
2,Good while it lasted,"I do some occasional work on some cars and was very suprised to find that my jack failed under the 1 year period from which i bought it. I thought since i wasn't using it everyday it would last some time, but apparently not. Went to lift my car (2800lbs) on one side and the jack made a popping noise and began to lower itself. I believe the seal is no longer holding pressure. Does not lift and hold enough pressure anymore. I lost the receipt which is unfortunate but i will not be buying this jack again. worked great for a couple of months but after that not sure what happened."
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"This low-profile jack is awesome in all respects except for one crucial point: LETTING THE JACK DOWN!Most sane people (I would imagine) would like to slowly & progressively release the hydraulic fluid pressure from their floor jacks in order to slowly, safely, and in a controlled fashion, lower their vehicle (be it a motorcycle or a 4-wheeled vehicle) back to the ground. No-can-do with this crazy-azz jack. Twist the jack handle anti-clockwise as gently, carefully and as precisely as a neurosurgeon would, or as quick, brutish, and abruptly as a prehistoric caveman might do. The outcome is the same: Your vehicle comes crashing down to earth in a nanosecond, just like the stock cars in the pits at the Daytona 500 after a tire change. All of the hydraulic pressure bleeds out in about two-tenths of a second, GRRRRRR!!!PS: TORIN, PLEASE RE-ENGINEER THE HYDRAULIC PRESSURE RELIEF SYSTEMS ON YOUR FLOOR JACKS!!!PPS: I'm really mad right now!!!"
1,"One Way Up, No Way Down!","So just as the previous reviews on here state this jack is well, jack$#!+. This was about $169 (including stands) from Pep boys about 6 months ago, obviously I do not have the receipt thinking this jack would last me forever... Not. Anyhow this will jack up your car perfectly fine however once your ready to take your car down to the ground - super slam like a WWF wrestler, you know exactly the way you want to drop your brand new $35K car. I got what I would say one or two solid uses out of this and now it's bound for the scrap yard. BUYER BEWARE, this jack should be recalled."
2,Not happy,Used the jack once and it worked fine. The jack cylinder started leaking after that and made a mess. It's very heavy. The stands are a good design but are small.
2,Item does not fit the description,"The description says ""elastic headband"" but the one I got was a felt headband with velcro strips sewed to the ends that were sewn on backwards. The feather slides down into a slot cut into the felt and does not fit snugly into it, so it falls over. I had to get out the sewing kit and make some changes for this to work."
1,No good!,"This season is terrible with the new kids. I do not like it at all. I also do not like the direction Rachel is going. Hopefully, she and Finn will get back together. Sleazy Brody and and Hudson do not add ANYTHING to this show."
1,LOVE Glee & HATE commercials!!!,"I want my money back! I DID NOT PAY FOR 16 seconds of commercials before the show or 2 min of commercials after! Your commercials eat up the limited internet usage that I have way out here in the country. I DID love amazon vidoes when it first came out and I have been a VERY loyal customer, and how have I gotten re-paid? By Amazon sneaking in commercials that I DON'T WANT TO WATCH and I PAID so that I would not have to watch!!!! STOP the commercials or start loosing customers!!!"
4,Glee fan from the beginning,"I love Glee, but I don't find myself anxious to see the next episode the way I felt the first seasons. It is still a great show though."
3,Good/Too Much?,"I love the music from this TV series. The only thing that hits it hard for me is that it is very controversial. It hits every controversial subject out there, and it feels like this year there is too much to take in at one time. They have the graduates come back as well as having all new people. The controversial issues in this series combined with the same ones as last year might be too much. What this series needs is closure so the watchers can move on. In this series so far they are becoming a little overwhelming with the issues and drama it sparks."
1,Song thieves,"Glee has delved into stealing songs from other artists without crediting them. Hearing ""Baby Got Back"" from the recent episode when it's exactly the same as Jonathan Coulton's version makes me cringe. I will never buy or watch an episode of Glee."
1,Fox Steals from Indie Artists...,instead of writing their own arrangements for the show. We shouldn't let this slide. Please help take action again Fox for being head handed and rubbing it in Jonathan Coultrain's face.
5,GREAT!,"This wouldn't be my FAVORITE season... only b.c my fav characters aren't in high school anymore, therfor aren't your main characters anymore... but this season is still great! Def recommend it! LOTS of amazing, new, cast members.... with incredible voices!"
4,"Fun, Excitement, and Love","Very talented young people. Sue, Will, and the counselor are funny and love their prospective on life:-) watch the show!"
2,Not my kind of show,"Not my kind of show - the singing was good, but I'm really not interested in this type of comedy/entertainment"
2,2 point no,"Although I enjoy both Heather Mo and Britney. I was sure I would enjoy a show done around Brittany. This was actually a pretty sad episode. Of course I was happy it looks like Berry will get out of her shell FINALLY. Oh yeah, and I'm already tired of this shallow, predictable new Puckerman."
1,Glee,"It was chunky and stunk, I would never pay money for something like this again.it would be great if you made them load faster"
3,Indifferent Season,"This season has its strengths and its weaknesses. First, the female cast members have not defined themselves. There is the Minnie Mouse look alike who is most irritating. And the blonde child...who is evil like Sue and Santana BUT there is nothing to like about her...the element that made Sue and Santana characters defined and enjoyable to watch. As for the males, the writers are trying too hard. At least the leprechaun is gone...what a bad decision he was. Blaine...please decide is he Howdy Doody's illegitimate son or sexy preppy...I would go with the sexy preppy. Now Finn...this guy has come into his own...perfect. The only male with energy on screen is the cross dresser...why isn't he there always...and he should have been Rizzo...period. All said, I still like the show but I dread when a new episode arrives...because I do not know if it is gonna be a good show or bad. Season 3 and 4 are fifty/fifty."
3,Trying too hard,"Season 4 isn't starting out so hot! They aren't giving the new cast a chance by constantly bringing the old cast back every episode & in some of the most unbelievable, illogical ways. Not that Glee has even been known for being believable! But they are going too far. It's ok to keep up with the old cast, but quick bringing them back to Lima at every turn. Let the new cast have their chance to shine & build the story around them now. The story is just getting ridiculous now. I mainly watch for the music, but even the music choices this season aren't anything to write home about. Glee better get it's game together, or I won't be watching much longer. Stick with seasons 1-3...season 4 needs major help!"
4,great show..,"great show... i think the earlier seasons were better, but its still a great watch..no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!"
4,Glee is Action-Packed,"No, you will not find cars flipping and bursting into flame or high-speed chases, but Glee zings and sings quickly. As the cast of characters grows and as obligations to feature each one become complex, the story line is brief, more like a quick segue between big musical production numbers. If you've ever taken your wee ones to a performance of Sesame Street Live or even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (I'm several decades old, okay?), then you know what I mean: the story is thin in order to bring along the music, dance, and applause. I still watch. I still care about these kids, but the narrative may well be lost and forgotten completely in 2013."
2,Missed the mark,"The first three seasons of Glee were highly entertaining and contained some valuable social commentary. Season 4 so far has devolved into a minor soap opera. Missed the mark, overstayed the welcome"
4,"Season 4 ""Break-Ups""","I had been debating with myself whether I should keep watching GLEE this season because there didn't seem to be any continuity in the past three episodes. They all seemed rather helter skelter. Finally, we get to episode 4, ""Break-Ups"", and I now see this was the episode that determines where the rest of the season goes. The couples needed to break up or take a break from each other in order to establish a new path for GLEE. The old group is never going to be the same and that's alright. The new path is now established and I am anxious to see where it takes the show from here on out. I thought the musical numbers in this episode were also the best of the season. They were full of emotions which made them sound very powerful and rich. Let's hope there will be more episodes as great as this one as the season progresses."
1,Too much,I love Glee and have all three seasons but I will not pay that much for season four. I'll wait.
3,I got it because I am a fan of the music.,"I was disappointed with the story, but I still like the music from this series. I hope they figure out how to make the story interesting and funny again, instead of just tragic."
5,Great show!,"I love the music, the characters, the writing, and the cast. They are incredibly talented young actors, and the show continues to please!"
5,Excellent work of scholarship.,"This is a very deep and powerfully researched book. Its central arguments seem to me, not an expert by any means, to be unassailable. It is very well organised and written simply and clearly. Do order it."
4,Great watch,Great watch!!I bought for my wife to wear while she plays tennis and she loves the design and look. This is a great sport watch for any outdoor activity
4,Bob Isaacson is a great teacher!,"This book is req'd for a class, but I likely would have bought it anyway. I've seen video lectures by Bob Isaacson and he's an incredible teacher who really seems to know his subject and brings devotion and enthusiasm to all aspects of it. Hearing him speak on ""The Love Song of Alfred Prufrock"" was a turning point for me in understanding 20th century American poetry.The format is similar to college reading texts, whereas subjects are discussed with the student responding via essay or Blackboard Discussion boards. This is an ideal text for that, and the price was much less than what I've paid in prior semesters for ""Signs of Life in the USA"" which had been req'd before."
2,Out of my league,"I read all 13 reviews on this book and felt that this was the book I was looking for. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong! I've been playing the tenor sax with a teacher for about five years and, if I may blow my own horn, I'm no slouch in the brains department. By the time I got to page 21 I knew I was was out of my league. He starts talking about major/minor diatonic scales and thirds and sixths, stacked triads and an assortment of other things that he assumes you already know. I even went back and reread the book from page one figuring I must have missed something. Maybe I'm wrong but I feel you need a pretty well rounded backround in music theory before you even pick up this book on music theory. David Harp's ""Music Theory Made Easy"" was an excellent (and short) book that imparted a whole lot more info to me. Good luck."
5,Music Theory CAN Be Interesting,"I bought this book at a time where I was taking two guitar lessons per week, and just starting to get comfortable with the instrument. I had been interested in the music theory side of things for quite some time, but each book I tried was dry, boring, and just miserable to read - until my guitar teacher recommended this one. You really will be shocked at how entertaining music theory can be. It covers a wide range of topics, and was absolutely perfect for a beginner like me."
1,Failed in less than a year,"The concept is great. I was very excited about a ""bullet proof"" USB storage device that was advertised as failproof. In less than a year the graphics wore off completely from being on my keychain, which in itself isn't the main problem. Granted, it took away from the appearance, but the main issue is with the total failure of the unit. No reason that I'm aware of. . .never been in water, never thrown, never dropped. . .it simply stopped being recognized. I tried three different computers at work and two of my laptops at home. . . the USB storage device simply stopped working. I'm very disappointed, especially having paid as much as I did to have this type of an upgraded USB storage device. I have several plastic units that are older, yet still working. My lesson. . .Costo specials that come as three packs. I'm going to contact Pretec tomorrow to see what they have to say. I'll be back with an update."
4,Astonishing book,"Very good book.It has a lot of exercises and many useful day-to-day expressions that you can use in everyday life.The layout of the book uses a very hands-on approach because all the exercises deal with examples that we can relate to.I look forward to buy the next book in the series.The only reason for the 4-star rating is because the cover and paper the text is written on is not of very good quality, that is, it looks and feels like a pulp magazine !!!"
1,"Awful, just awful!","A huge disappointment. A 12-year-old boy's outlook on sex (except some 12-year-old boys have a maturer attitude), and the race dialogue will make you wince and cringe. Besides, nobody actually talks like that. Flat dialogue, wooden characters, cutesy flashbacks...ugh..."
2,Disappointing,"I don't know when I have been more disappointed in a book. There is foreshadowing early on that the story will end badly, and indeed it does, on many levels. The story definitely draws you in, and while the author has a wonderful gift for prose and has bravely tackled sensitive issues, the result is an unbelievable, unhappy story with characters that are all foolish, weak, and selfish. Spencer portrays blacks very stereotypically and negatively, and it seems that he spent little time researching interracial couples.The ending was an absolute disaster - how I wish I had stopped reading before I reached it."
1,Improbable,"OK, I'll admit that love stories aren't my favorite genre, and I got the book from the library only because it was an NBA nominee. Perhaps I got confused and basketball players, not book critics, made that nomination?I found the events improbable and the characters unlikeable and unbelievable. The end of the book was awful. Spencer seems to have tired of telling the story, so he abandoned everyone in the stinking mess that he had created, with their noses barely above the surface."
3,Not a Love Story,"This is my first Spencer book and although I'm coming late to the hype, I just have to comment. I enjoyed this book if for no other reason than it kept me reading. I tried to be open-minded and constantly reminded myself that it was a work of fiction, however, as a black woman I couldn't help feeling at times like I got slapped. First, I was never convinced that Daniel was in love with Iris (this was not a love story). Second, there were so many stereotypes in this book I started to predict them before the passages appeared. And finally, black women are once again portrayed as empty, machine-like sexual beings.What could have been an outstanding love story was instead a typical account of what most people probably believe a relationship between a white man and black woman would amount to."
2,what's love got to do with it,"I agree with many reviewers that the writing was good in part but wasted on unlikeable characters, a weak romance and unpleasant stereotypes (why are all the young black male characters violent, why doesn't the devoted mother get counseling for a 5 yr old who left a babysitter needing 20+ stitches and shot at another kid, why does the caring stepfather let these kids play together unsupervised?)And I think there was a glaring error in the very first sentence that foreshadows a critical scene when it says Kate has to leave the party to relieve the daughter's babysitter because they took the daughter with them to the party."
4,A beautiful read,"This is my first Scott Spencer book, and I will definitely seek out his previous works. I loved this book, and could identify with many of the characters. Mr. Spencer writes beautifully, his decriptions of people, places and situations are unconventional and startling. The book's main theme is obsession, and how it can destroy the lives of many. It doens't have the happiest of endings, but it was extremely well-written and enjoyable."
5,Obsession or True Love???,I read this book about a year ago and recommended it to a few friends. This still sparks discussion amongst us even today. The debate mostly centers around Daniel's obsession or love for Iris. You be the judge! I found the author's use of setting and mood to match perfectly. Spencer does an excellent job of painting word pictures and weaving plotlines together smoothly. I finished this book quickly based more on the intrigue of the novel than length. If you're looking for a book club book for the new season pick this one up!
5,Wild ride.,"Scott Spencer takes his readers on a greased roller coaster of wild twists and turns. You may want to wring their necks, but you will care about these characters. Great read."
3,Kate,"The only reason why this book sneaks by with three stars is the character of Kate. She is racist in a very complex way, also a mother and lover with the same complex dimensions. Her character helps explain a lot in modern day society, why some people are still racist, in a less overt way. Just about every other character seems to be one dimensional, at best. So, though this book is far from perfect, you should still read it."
4,Enjoyed this book,I really enjoyed this book. It was almost educational to be on the inside of this type of relationship. Also made for an interesting book club discussion.
3,"Great until the end, then stumbles","I loved this book and couldn't stop reading it-- until nearly the end, when the author does something so unbelievable -- an obvious structural device -- that it ruined the book for me. Then he does three more things like that. These outlandish events move the plot, but they not only strain credulity, they throw it on the floor and stamp all over it. Until then, the writing is wonderful -- everything is wonderful. Such passion. Such good writing. Such nuances of character. Scott Spencer understands romantic passion and family life like no other writer. He renders romantic love and familial love and the deep vagaries of the human heart. But he doesn't understand how badly a deus ex machina can ruin a story. I love the theme of obsessive love. (Another good novel like this is ""Here On Earth"" by Alice Hoffman -- a great read.) I feel sorry for Scott Spencer and I feel sorry about ""A Ship Made Of Paper."" It was almost a clear winner. Oh well."
2,Not sure what Scott was trying to say in this novel,"I'm not sure what to think of the book. As I was reading it, I kept thinking 'what is Scott saying to his readers?' with this text. I thought it was at times a little stereotypical. I was even suspicious of why the book gave attention to the O.J. trial. I didn't feel like the book redeemed itself in the end. (Speaking of the end, I didn't QUITE get it, but anyway...) I guess I was looking for the 'love conquers all' thing (or at least love will conquer what we want it to, not necessarily ALL). I think Spencer needed to do more research into interracial relationships before trying to write a novel about two people who were obviously terribly lonely (Iris) and curious about the other (Iris and Daniel). This was hardly a love story. It was incomplete and quite frankly, hopeless."
4,"Riveting, but not perfect","A Ship Made of Paper works as kind of a riveting, emotional page-turner. This is rear for a piece of literary fiction, which can usually be easily put down, as much as I like the ""genre."" Some of the dealings with race are clumsy, and the plot turns push the boundries of plausibility, but Spencer also demonstrates real skill jumping in and out of his various characters' perspectives. Ultimately, it's just a terribly entertaining read.PSDon't read the Publisher's Weekly review. They give away too much."
2,Screwed up,"Another reviewer mentioned that the characters and story drew her in, but that the ending of the story was just too difficult. I feel just the opposite. The tragic events near the end of the book finally gave an otherwise dull story some color. The screwed up characters were not particularly interesting and I had a very hard time getting engaged in their random and self-destructive behavior. Of the last 20 or 30 novels that I have read, this one I almost abandoned midstream. I acknowledge that there were moments of sensitivity and clever insight in this book, but these redeeming nuggets were floating in a sea of boredom."
4,Worth the Journey,"This is a maddening book. As you read it, you so want it to be more real yet you can't help but hope for a fairy tale ending. That's not realistic, but, then again, little in this book is, except for the passion. The passion--that's what Scott Spencer gets exactly right here again. And it's the passion and our desire to live within it, at least vicariously, that keeps us reading and rooting for Daniel and Iris despite the fact that we don't quite understand them or buy them as characters. Is it worth the read? I couldn't put it down. Still, I didn't feel particularly edified about race or any of the issues the reviews are touting. I just wanted for the characters to win, whatever winning is, and I wanted the book to keep going."
5,Brilliant,"Not a word wasted, this is a brilliantly crafted novel from every aspect.Absolutely beautiful prose, deep, almost mystical character development and well plotted, but all in an effortless style that makes this book true literary art. I've just finished a number of best selling and well reviewed fiction books for 2004, and among all of them, this book is a standout because of not only the author's vast talent, but the maturity of his voice as a writer and observer of humanity. There is no neat ending, and there is no need for one, not because the author is aiming for tragedy as much as documenting a believable reality for the ficitonal world he has constructed. The beauty is that it all rings true and is a riveting read from start to finish."
3,Disappointed,"I too, was very anxious and excited to read ""A Ship Made of Paper"" after reading many reviews in various magazines and newspapers. I had also recently read Scott Spencer's ""Endless Love"" (the book on which the movie with Brooke Shields was based) and thoroughly enjoyed that one.I have to admit at this point that I have not yet finished this book, and I just can't seem to. I do not feel a connection with any of the characters, and the storyline does not seem interesting to me. I hesitate to judge a book based on the fact that I personally am not interested in it, but since that is the very purpose of this review forum, I will.I really wanted to love this book! I plan to start it over from the very beginning and give it another chance."
3,Don't Cheat!,"The usual message about infidelity, delivered in very well-crafted prose. Nicely drawn characters and relationships. Lots of pathos. A good summer read that I jumped the gun on and read in May."
1,What tripe!,What a disappointing book! I felt like I needed to take a shower after I closed it. I read it all--which says something for Spencer's ability to suck people in but I wish I hadn't. All the characters were weak and foolish. It had a totally implausible plot and unbelievable relationships between characters. Yuck!
3,The fact that I finished this is book is testament to Spencer's skills,"What a waste of time. I liked the book, but hated the characters. The only reason I finished the book was in hopes that all the characters would choke on their own vomit at the end. Scott Spencer can write, but I certainly wish he'd picked something more interesting to write about than the dreary lives of these upper-middle-class characters. These were truly vapid, insipid people. Maybe that was his point, but I have better things to do with my time, and this gifted writer shouldn't waste his time on them either."
5,Great book,"I really enjoyed this book. I don't like long hair on guys, but other than that - loved the male MC. (and why do so many books have covers that look nothing like the characters??? ugh) The plot set up allowed for some great situations. All in all, a very good read. FYI - ""The Kissing Game"" by this author is also good."
3,light reading,I did enjoy this book. I have been a big fan of Suzanne Brockmann since I discovered her Trouble Shooters series. This book is not on the same calibur as the TS series but it is a good book for light reading.
3,works on balancing mood but pesky side effect,This supplement felt like the sunshine to my inner rainy days. The first week was high energy good mood. By week two the behavioral side effects were phenomenal. Then came the constipation. It lingered for a week after that and I resolved that the pills were the cause. I continue taking fiber at night but I am going to switch brands when the bottles of this brand are empty. If the side effect wasn't so inconvenient I would have given this product 5 stars.
4,My daughter loves this,My daughter loves this but I didnt read carefully and thought it was a chart you could save vs. stick on the wall...so her growth would never be recorded and saved with this chart...oh well.... It was worth it for her because she loves all the tiny little animals and other stick on things that come with it and she is not even 1 year old yet
4,nice puzzle,Bought for my 2 yrs old son. He has a thing for puzzles of all kinds. He really enjoyed these. Nice vivid colors. The only thing is they are not sturdy enough for the roughness of a 2yr old boy.
4,GREAT LITTLE CUP OF COFFEE,SOUTHERN PECAN IS MY FAVORITE FLAVORED COFFEE. GREEN MOUNTAIN SOUTHERN PECAN K-CUPS ARE A GREAT VALUE AND A RICH BLEND. IF USING THE LARGE CUP SETTING ON YOUR MACHINE SOME OF THE FLAVOR WILL BE LOST. STICK TO THE SMALLER CUP FOR A DELIGHTFUL CUP OF COFFEE!!
2,Very strong,"This does have a nice pecan aroma, but not at all a sweetened pecan/pecan pie aroma or flavor. It's actually a lot stronger than any other flavored Green Mountain coffee K-cup I've tried--stronger coffee, less sweet, less obvious flavor than the others."
3,Amazing inventory problem,"I loved this when it was ~$20 but it went out of stock and became ""unavailable"". Orders arbitrarily cancelled. Now its back but , oops... its $60. I guess Exxon bought the company!"
1,Not at all what I thought I was getting!,Got these in a couple of colors for use with dry erase markers for a menu at the shop. Does not erase or come off with water. Will be returning these!
5,perfect solution.....,"This curling iron holder is a perfect solution for ""what to do with the cord, outlet on wrong side, not enough space, etc."" It is not expensive, great looking, and convenient. Love it!!!!"
4,Something that works as it should.,"We bought these hair curler iron holders when we got a new simulated granite (plastic) bathroom vanity top. We wanted something to protect it from the irons. These units work great. They are heavier that other holders we've looked at, heavy enough to keep the irons in place so the wires do not pull them around. They also have a good rubber coating on their bases, which also helps keep them from sliding around as well as protecting the vanity surface from getting scratched. This is a good heavy-duty product. The only real drawback is that they take up a bit of counter top real-estate and they cannot easily be used for travel since they do not fold up & they are heavy!"
5,YES!,omg!!! this product puts an end to the scorch marks on the bathroom sink or whatever else you rest your curling irons on while you section off pieces to curl. i LOVE this item!
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL OF ED EMBERLEY'S DRAWING BOOKS!,"Every year as the holidays approached my daughter requested this book from the library. Ed Emberley's books are still the best books for easy step-by-step drawing instructions - simple lines and shapes accumulate into a satisfying whole. My son rarely picked up a drawing utensil, but he'd be down on the floor, right beside his sister drawing away - satisfied and rarely frustrated. Emberley's ""Big Orange Book"" also recieved a lot of use in our house around Halloween."
5,The next step to ed's drawing....,Ed's books on thumbprints...and simplier drawing books would probably be considered the *first* steps while i would consider this the *first and a half* step... there are more complex (more steps to some pictures) drawings... there are still pretty easy ones and if this isnt your shilds first book and they are at a stage where they are ready for something a bit more challenging this would be a good second line of art books.. it still is writtne in the same way and there are still easy easy things to draw BUT for those wishing to increase their skill/hardness level..there are pictures with more steps. the pictures are still broken down into easy to follow steps and it is STILL much easier and more understandable than most art books out there for kids... and there are so many things to choose from!
5,best Sole album,"Im not one of those people who think every anticon release is awesome (the no music, why, pedestrian, passage i cant listen to) I love No more wig for ohio, dpd, them, greenball, 10 seconds, muted, I didnt even know if i liked live from rome after listening to it the first time, but something made me hit play again after it was done, it has a unique vibe(6 tracks produced by Odd Nosdam and 4 by alias). Great subway music.I bought live from rome the same day i bought a healthy distrust, the revolution of young havoks, streets deciple, and sleepers, and Iv listened to it more than all the previous combined. now i can say i like it better than every other previous sole release, probally mostly due to the production, sensible cultural observations, and no cheesy rants like (the white man is the f_ing devil...).Favorite track 16"
4,Good Machine NO Problems!,Bought the machine at Lowes a couple years ago(2003). I've had no problems whatsoever with it! I use it to both grind and buff various materials. Plenty of torque and the variable RPM lets me fine tune the SFPM for buffing everything from plastic to stainless. Not a production type machine but good cost/benefit. A really fine diamond dressing tool was included which keeps the grinding wheels running smoothly. Note: I worked in manufacturing for 30 years and have used 12-15 HP grinding machines (grey iron foundry) and 6-8 HP buffing machines (plastic and soft metal CNC machine shop).
4,"Very interesting and timely, well researched","If you think that voters elect presidents, well think again. The dangers inherent in the Electoral College is the subject of this book. Mr. Greenfield takes pock shots at all the sacred cows of American politics and media. Sometimes political thriller, sometimes political satire, ""The People's Choice"" is a timely choice as the country enters yet another election year"
4,Made me look smarter.,"As I write this the Florida Recount is still ongoing (Fri. Nov. 10, 2000). Having read this book, I was not only entertained, I became knowledgeable about all the trivial information about the electoral college, which now looks to be far less trivial than it used to be.In fact in a conversation about the possibilities in this election, a reletive mused aloud, ""I wonder if anyone has considered what would happen if an elected president was killed before he could take office.""... I immediatly cited this book.If ever a work of fiction could be considered a must read. For now, this would be that book"
4,Hilarious,"What happens when the victorious president-elect is killed in an accident 3 days after the election? Total pandimonium and hilarity. Remember, no one is REALLY elected until December, by the Electoral College, not the People. So here are 538 men and women with the legal power to elect the next president, nobody knows who they are and the presidency is essentially up for grabs! Could this really happen? Some lawyers say yes.The characters are great satires of some living persons (we all know who is supposed to be the Very Reverend W. Dixon Mason don't we? and Teddy Block is a charicature of Dan Quayle) but most are made up. I can't tell you how funny this book is until you read it, and the story line is a real possibility.I don't think the Electoral College needs abolishing...but that's just me, and it's a debate for another time."
4,Funny and Educational in a Workmanlike way...,"I'm not usually one to read so-called ""Washington"" novels, whose plots revolve around politics and its attending infrastructure. This one, however, is probably worth the short time it takes to read. It bears the subtitle ""A Cautionary Tale"" and rightfully so, for the novel is simply a fictional device to deliver the message that the American system of employing an electoral college is seriously flawed and outdated. With workmanlike prose, Greenfield presents a tale in which a president-elect is killed in the time between the popular election and the actual election by the college of electors. What is exposed is the complete failure of the system to account for any such anomaly as first one elector refuses to vote for VP-elect to fill the dead president-elect's position. Greenfield manages to make all the normal Washington-insider dealings, media coverage, and so forth, somewhat interesting and entertaining. Check it out, you might learn something."
5,Great to help you sleep!,I love to listen to this CD when I go to bed or when I want to relax. It drowns out the sounds of my neighbors and helps me unwind. There are no bird calls or other distracting sounds just the soothing sound of rain. It's a must have for those who have difficulty sleeping.
2,Hisssing like a tape,"The louder I turn it, the louder the hissssing. It's possible that it's meant as a part of the rain sound, but to me it sounds like non-stop hissssing. If it wasn't for that it seems like it would be very relaxing. Too bad!"
3,Garlic,"I have tried other garlic products and they were so mild that you could not taste any garlic flavor. However, the garlic cloves from Delicias were better. They tasted like garlic without being overpowering."
4,"Garlic as a garnish, snack or for a cocktail accent","I used to have access to 'armstrong garlic' in a tangy pickling solution, but that company seems to have stopped making pickled garlic cloves. In my search to replace the armstrong product I have found these little gems. The brine mellows the garlic to a very pleasant taste, but they are not truly 'pickled'. Be warned: they are extremely salty. Eating 6 or 7 of these will give you half your recommended sodium intake for a full day. They are firm and crunchy out of the jar, and can add some zip to a condiment tray, or make a unique contribution to a dirty martini."
3,Not very useful if you are looking for help on Fritz,"I was looking for ways on how to use Fritz and Fritz Powerbook etc. in ways of getting training and this book didn't help much, it seems."
2,The worst book I've had the pleasure of reading,"The Cooter Farm is the worst book I have ever finished reading. But it's not just bad, it's entertainingly bad. Strange similies (comparing a man's scrotum to a bag of grapes???) abound. The characters' names are just awful, but amusingly awful. The story is just plain weird and disturbing. But it's worth reading, nonetheless, which is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1. The bad writing is great fun to laugh at. It might even be worth reading if you're a budding author and want an example of how not to write."
4,"Wherefore Art Thou, Romeo?","I love the ""Cats"" video, but it teases us with clips from Armando Acosta's All-Cat Romeo-Julet (1990) video, which has become more rare than the dinosaur! I think I've searched the known universe, but somebody, somewhere, must know how to get it out of ""moratorium""...the time is ripe to resurrect this treasure!"
4,A bit pessimistic,"A good book, with loads of detail information, but a reader will likely decide not to do the conversion after reading about all the customization and banging and chopping that, according to this book, must be performed.From those I've talked to it's really not that bad. So use the book as a guide and don't let him talk you out of making the conversion."
3,Camp? Are you crazy?,If you go to camp this may interest you. Watch for the ghosts. You never know which person (or people) may not be what they seem.
3,It was pretty good.,I have read better books by R.L. Stine but it was better than the first seniors book.
4,Good Seniors Book,"In Too Deep is a good Seniors book. Kenny Klien is the main charcter in the book. He is pretty cool. This book has it's moments and it is shocking at the end, but it isn't as good as the first Seniors book Let's Party. But I would still recommened it becuase it is part of the Seniors series."
3,In Too Deep,"Kenny Klien, Debra Lake, Ty Sullivan, and Dana Palmer are at day camp, but for Kenny Klien, things just keep wierder and weirder, like Vincent, the kid who always wore a mask, Graydon, the nasty little boy who is determined to anger everyone, and Melly, the beautiful arts and crafts counselor, only she seems to turn up missing every once in a while. But his girlfired, Jade Feldman won't find out about Melly unles Dana tells her. And to add to that, someone in camp is trying to kill him. And the doomed class is the last thing from his mind... I thought is was an okay story. It was way better than the first seniors book. It was different from all the other Fear Street books. Death Count: 1, Seniors Dead: None. Can't wait for Graduation day!"
4,In Too Deep,"In Too Deep is a pretty good Seniors book. I like Kenny Klein, he's pretty cool. This book had a couple of surprises and twists which I like alot. And this book also introduced my favorite senior Ty Sullivan. In Too Deep is a great book. I would recommened it!"
4,Brilliant,"Although I personally think that book 1 is far more interesting that book 2, I still rate it high cuz it still keeps u to read on and on without stoping. I'll recommend to anyone that's my age.(That is, 13)"
4,"I agree---Not as good as ""Let's Party""","This was an interesting story, but it didn't maintain my interest as much as the first Seniors book. Stiil, it was good. Stine has written much better ones, though."
5,Excellent book,"I think a number of the other reviews missed the point in this volume. This book offers an amazingly diverse sampling of the world's mythologies, preceding each myth with an introduction that attempts to provide some cultural context. These are NOT the original myths, as people have noted, but that is done intentionally. Had each of these stories been included in its original form the result would have been a cyclopean tome that likely would have to be broken into numerous volumes. But why do that? There are already countless disparate sources available for one to find the original stories -- this book offers more of a ""world mythology digest"" that tries to hit on the key themes and events of each story it relates, and does a decent enough job doing so."
2,World Mythology Textbook,"Considering the fact that it is just a textbook, the World Mythology: An Anthology of Great Myths and Epics book is explained in a simple manner, easy to understand. The reading selections are edited to allow students to understand the overall idea of the main myths without going into a lot of detail. However, there are a few annoying typos throughout the book and some serious mistakes like the wrong names of heroes or gods in some sections which really makes students confused. Again, not too serious for a textbook, but I would not use it for a serious investigation or research for a presentation."
2,Bowdlerized summaries,"While Donna Rosenberg does provide a nice, complete collection of well-known world myths, this book is not, as it promises, an ""anthology of fine literature"": rather, it gives a quick summary and overview of each myth, written in boring, stilted prose and often watered-down and censored. Sexuality, violence, and foul conduct are an important part of mythology, and to see those elements removed defeats the point: yes, the harpies took a dump in the water. Yes, Cronos castrated Uranus.Yet Donna Rosenberg glosses over these details without once bothering to discuss their meaning.In fact, Rosenberg's notes in this book are set on one thing and one thing only: her absolute determination to tell the reader about the wonders of the matriarchal pre-history she so firmly wants to believe in (even when it is utterly irrelevant to the story being discussed!)Buy this book if you have to for a class, but if you want to truly study mythology on your own count this one out."
5,A must for myth buffs,"This book is fantastic! Every professor should have their students read this. The stories give a synopsis and describe the characters prior. So much detail, yet not a bore or blur. Highly recommend."
5,"It's about the music, isn't it?","The reviewer who gave this album a single star was actually commenting on the stage show and had nothing to say about the music. Listen with an open mind and you'll hear a GREAT collection of rockers and ballads, with can't-get-it-out-of-your-head melodies and that rarest of things: lyrics that actually mean something (and are very clever to boot).If I could, I'd deduct half a star for production quality, but Lewis (no relation) is an amazing songwriter and singer who deserves to be heard."
4,Great for tweens to octogenarians,"4.5 star review:We just played our first session of the basic Carcassonne (no expansions yet). Although the rules are not perfect (it's sometimes hard to know which tile has a cloister on it since the sheet with tile pictures does NOT name the tiles), we were playing intensely quite quickly. We liked it a LOT. One thing that was great: it was a way to introduce the Middle Ages in a concrete way to a 12 year old girl. So it has some educational value. But the principal value is thinking about how to build your city and how to use your limited followers, and realizing when the stack of tiles gets short that the game is almost ending and you have to do something. The scoring system is quite nice. Some people might complain that Carcassonne has some ""luck of the draw"" element to it, but that was fine with us."
3,Fine,"My fiancee likes this game, but is used to playing it with people who play it in a more cooperative style. I am a more competitive player, so we do not play this game together anymore. I think the game is ok, but nothing to go out of your way for. There are several interesting expansions, but I have not explored them fully"
4,Easy and Fun!,"This game is very easy to learn and can even be played by one who isn't that strategy-minded. (Think settlers) The only downside is that farming is pretty overpowering as a strategy. If you don't farm and another player does, you will lose. For that, I give it a 4/5. Also, it does come with a lot of puzzle-like pieces that can be easily lost.Overall though, a very fun game and it's easy to learn!"
3,"Great game, girlfriend hates it","I really like this game, and it is a lot of fun if you are playing with the right people. However, there is a fair amount of backstabbing to play the game effectively, and certain people might not enjoy this."
5,We love this game,We play this game constantly. Good for all ages (we ranged from 7-60) who like a strategy-type game that you can play under an hour. It's a different game every time because of the versatile board and the luck of the draw and things can switch with the draw of a tile. Recommended for all couples/families/indviduals who love board games.
3,It's fun but also a beating,My wife and I got this game for the holiday season to play with family. The game is fun but we have a problem at the end of the game scoring all the land the farmers are on. It's quite a beating to us. We've played it 4 times and each time came away with complaints about the scoring. Maybe we just need to be drinking more wine/beer during game play.
4,carcassonne - KJ Wrede,This was a gift for our daughter who enjoys games with friends - she asked for this and seems to be happy with her choice.
5,Great Fun!,"We bought this game because it makes a great two player game for my husband and I, and it is just as fun if you have guests over for dinner and a game. We enjoy the quality of the components, as well as the strategy and skill it takes to win. It is a wonderful and cheaper alternative to the more expensive Settlers of Catan. All in all a very good game!"
5,Grab a ziplock and you are ready to play!,"Carcassonne is one of the family favorites! Carcassonne usually ends up as the game of choice at family gatherings (with Puerto Rico, Corsairs, and Settlers as back ups). The rules are easy to pick up, as we usually just show a couple of pieces and explain the game as we go for new players. Strategies have developed to pick on the perceived 'leader', box in your 'favorite' players piece on impossible pieces to finish, defensive meadow closings, etc.This game is great for replay. The 'luck' of what you draw can be overcome with repeated play.This game (with Corsairs) is one of our favorites to bring camping, traveling, or backpacking. Grab a ziplock, pen and paper and your off!"
5,GREAT game!!,This is a great game. My 8 & 10 year old sons love to play and I love to play with them. A new board is created every time you play which keeps it fresh. Enjoyed the game much more with the add-on Inns & Cathedrals.
4,"Well Made game, durable pieces, Good for Younger Players","THe first thing I noticed immediately upon opening the box was how durable the pieces are. They feel like a good quality cardboard puzzle (E.g. Ravensburger). That's always nice, especially with a three year old who likes to get into things. My wife and 10 year old son quickly learned the game, and both found it very fun. My son had a friend over the foloowing day and he also learned the game quickly. So, from that aspect, it's great for pre-teens. My wife, who doesn't normally like ""strategy"" type games, found the game to be very fun... competitive but not really cut throat (games like Risk which she doesnt enjoy). Overall, very worth the price. Good value."
5,"Easy to learn, but never gets boring","The rules are easy to learn, but the strategy is ever evolving. Mom 60 year old mom, and 11 year old niece both enjoyed playing this with us. The game is very well balanced, and you can influence who you help (this is nice if you're playing with kids). It's a great lesson in resource planning, and employing your assets wisely in order to have the best return."
5,"Oddly Compelling, and Family-Friendly","Bias: I enjoy playing the Sim City card game. Also, I have not tried any of the expansions yet.Basically, the game is about laying down tiles that represent the French countryside, and using your set number of villagers to lay claim to elements of the Carcassonne area (county, province?). Once you complete an element (enclosed farm, road with a beginning & end, enclosed town, etc.), you get points for how big it is. Much of the fun is the puzzle-like element of choosing where your tile gets placed, to help you and/or hinder your opponent(s).The game is easy to learn, plays rather quickly, and doesn't require the deep strategy of other games like Chess or Go. It would probably make a good 'gateway drug' for a friend/relative/significant other who isn't ready for Axis & Allies or a marathon game of Zombies!!! on game-night.In summary, Carcassonne is a fun, relaxing little game that I could play with either my drinking buddies or my grandparents."
5,Great game for couples!,"I bought this game on the recommendation of a friend. My husband and I collect board games but don't have many that are fun with just two people. This game takes the cake! It's different every time and you can have up to 5 players, but it is just as fun with 2. If you enjoy Settlers of Catan, this is a MUST HAVE."
4,Great game even with only two players!,Simple but fun game that's easy to pick up and play. It sort of like a game where you create your own map. I like that this game works with as little as two players but is just as much fun with more.
5,A great game for everyone,"I got this game not too long ago. I have since played it with about a dozen different people and everyone one of them wants to play it again when they come over to my house. Everyone seems to enjoy it, from the super gamers who live to play games and get deeply into the strategy of it, to the casual player. Best game I have picked up in a long time.This is a great game, so I'd like to explain why I gave only 3 stars to some categories. It is not really an 'educational' toy, however I think most games that involve strategy have some lessons to teach. As for the durability... the wooden game pieces are very sturdy, the only real concern is with the tile pieces. They are a strong cardboard and should hold up fine for a long time but you'll probably need to be careful of getting them wet (don't spill your drinks at the gaming table).Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!"
4,Interesting Board Game,"An unusual board game unlike any other I've played. Perfect for two players. A bit of strategy and luck. Every game is different, never the same game twice. Easy to learn. Can be played in less than an hour. I recommend the River Expansion version to make it more interesting."
5,Simplicity is Elegance,"This is a simple fun game, the turn consists of picking a tile and laying it down, then either placing a piece on the tile or not. It can be learned quickly, but there is also a lot of strategy that can go into it. It doesn't require a lot of space, a regular table-sized flat space is all, and it requires very little set-up, just divvy out the playing pieces, mix up the tiles and you're ready to go.Other reviewers have given more comprehensive descriptions of the game, so I'll just say that everyone I've played the game with has enjoyed it greatly. It is something different from the standard game fare (not that we don't enjoy the standard board/card games, but this has a refreshing novelty for us)."
5,"Easy to learn, lots of fun","My family and I all love board games and bought this after reading the great reviews. It lived up to all expectations. My husband read the instructions and easily explained the game to us. Strategies are quickly realized but are varied. The game is different every time and can be played in under an hour.This game comes with the free ""river"" expansion pack so you can play with or without. I like with the river better.The game is most fun with two players, but we've played with up to four and still had a good time. Strategy changes with more people."
3,It was a gift,I got this as a gift for my son and he was very pleased to get it. He said it was something he had played and wanted to have his own to enjoy.
2,Disappointed,"I read the reviews and I was ready for a fun game...the truth is we only played it once, it was Ok...but nothing like the fun the other reviewers experienced! Maybe after you play it several times and get into the strategy it gets more fun, but it is rather dull really. Prefer Settlers of Catan for example a lot more (maybe it is because there isn't much interaction with the other players) that I found it dull."
5,game of the year,"i have introdruced this game to several families , a german game jury has voted it game of the year , it should be in every playing household !!if you are a playing person , you can start to train kids with the bacis already with 6 years . one friend of mine is 9 in the meanwhile , he beats me now almost every time :)"
4,Fast and Fun,"I first played this game at a game night gathering at work, and liked it so much I bought a copy. It's quick to play, quick to explain, and fun - you can easily finish a game in 30 minutes. The one down side is that it isn't nearly as much fun until you hit 4 players."
4,Pretty cool game.,"The game's a bit hard to learn. Easier if you're familiar with games like Settlers of Catan. Once you play a few games, you begin to see the strategy involved. I think there's a nice blend of luck-of-the-draw, and actual personal strategy to the game. I've only played with one other player, but 3 or 4 player games would be more entertaining.The cards/board is made of a pretty heavy duty paper board. The pieces are all wooden. The directions are not written that well...I think this is the main reason the game is a bit hard to learn at first. However, some of the ideas in the game are simply hard to explain with written words. Spend a little time reading the directions and you'll get the hang of it. Certainly need at least one adult to help teach the game at first."
5,Great fun for kids and adults,"I played this game at a friend's house, along with his two young kids, and absolutely loved it (and had to buy it). My 7-year-old has a great time with this, yet it's got enough depth that just adults can play as well. Definitely one of the best board games we have in the house."
5,"A fun, strategic, and easy to pick up game","We picked up the rules to this game pretty quickly, and have since introduced it to several friends who also were able to grasp the concept easily. It's good for 2 players as well as larger groups. There is an element of luck in addition to the strategy required, due to the tile-drawing nature of the game."
5,Great German style board game,"Carcassonne is a fun game. It's a German style board game, which means it is not played on a static board, rather the game board changes each game. We've played it a few times, and love it at much as Settlers of Catan. If you like one, you're likely to enjoy both."
3,Slow Going,"Peterson's guides are usually exceptionally helpful, but this one has distinct limitations. It presents brief narrative data (usually one short paragraph) on 178 boarding schools and 78 summer programs in the U.S. and Canada. Each school has the narrative data repeated in English, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Chinese, all on one page, and followed up by 19 graphical icons to give additional data (dress code?; student-computer ratio?;boys:girls?; percentage of international students?). The icons have to be memorized, or the reading is very slow going. Clearly designed for foreign readers, it is less useful to US readers than other boarding school guides."
5,\Unbelievably Joyous.,"The same CD had been given a friend, then misplaced. Finding it through Amazon, and many copies available, made my day, as well as the day of my entire Spanish Class who received it as a souvenir of a wonderful day, with honest to goodness paella, and listening to Spanish Music, especially Flamenco Highlights of Spain which had us all up and dancing - including our professor, age 91, and yours truly, age 85...so, thank you very much."
2,A coffee table book set to music,"The photos are beautiful, but they're stills, not video footage. That gives this DVD the feel of a coffee table book set to music. The music is moving and appropriately spiritual, but the experience feels bounded by the photo frames. I didn't get a feel of the real Outback - more a glossy set of postcards. As a homesick Australian, I was disappointed."
5,Absolutely blown away,"If you had to read one book about Ireland 1916-1922, this would definitely be it! It starts in the aftermath of 1916 and proceeds through the end of the Civil War. Flanagan does so well in bringing the history, the players - actual and fictional - and the atmosphere to life that I can't believe he wasn't there. (Don't think so, though...) Michael Collins, Ernie O'Malley, DeValera -- they're all here. Finally, this is quite simply an absolutely beautifully written book, even if you're not interested in Ireland, the time period, or the people involved."
5,rocke grill,This grill works great. My husband is a truck driver and this grill has no mess to clean up. It cooks better when the hamburger is not frozen but still works great.
2,Sunbeam Rocket Grill,I was given the Rocket Grill as a birthday gift. It was terriffic for about two weeks. Then the timer knob broke and no longer could I use the Grill. Since I have no receipt I did have no way to return it or get a new grill. Just sits on the counter in the garage.It was nice for the first two weeks and did all that was promised.
5,Best Grill Ever,The Rocket Grill really is the best grill ever. I belong to Weight Watchers and love the fact that the grease is whisked away from the meat I cook. Everything cooks so fast and there is no clean up.......just discard the used pouches. The seller is the very best to do business with. I had a Rocket Grill I had purchased from him that needed repair and the seller promptly sent me a new grill. I would recommend this seller to others.
5,"""A wonder Grill"" BBQ taste, inside cooking outside taste, NO CLEAN UP.","My son recently moved out and I know he is not a cooker. He eats pre cooked, Micowave food. I got him and my daughter one each. My Son loves it sooooo much. Turkey burgers, Beef burgers, boneless chicken breast, grill cheese and more. It's cheaper now for him to eat and ""No Mess Clean Up""LOVE, LOVE, Love the sunbeam Rocket Grill..."
4,"AH, THE GENIUS!!!!","Casting Jaime Pressly is an act of sheer genius. Yes, she now has been snatched up by a hot network comedy, but there was a time when she was hard to get anywhere. DOA is one of those rare gems of Jaime Pressly work where we get to marvel at....well...Jaime Pressly! I mean can there be any other reason to get this DVD other than the pressense of Jaime Pressly? Oh, the action scenes are well done, too. Jaime Pressly, action scenes, martial arts action scenes, more Jaime Pressly, it's all here."
2,Not what was expected,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my husband. In terms of functionality, the set works fine. As for the description -- it is an Ipex set (no problem with that for us) but extremely cheap looking. The case was covered in dust and EXTREMELY beat up when I received it. Deep scratches, the label was completely torn off the case and shoved in as if an aferthought, the top had cracks throughout... I was VERY disappointed in this, as like I said, this was a Christmas gift. The 'chrome' was scratched and peeling... overall, I was disgusted with the quality of this product and will NOT order anything from this line again. Before my husband opened this gift I felt the need to tell him it was brand new and not used, despite the shoddy appearance.As a dumbbell it works fine, but the case and visual quality is so poor it's actually shocking."
5,"Great Mouse, Great Buy",This mouse is a great buy. The unit comes with a docking station that is used for recharging the mouse. The unit charges quickly and the range on the mouse is great. The number of buttons available for customization are also a nice touch. This mouse is great unit for anyone looking for a cordless mouse.
2,"If you have large hands, skip this one",The buttons on the left side are placed too low in the thumb channel for large hands. If you have large hands you will likely find yourself clicking them inadvertently on a regular basis.
2,Great mouse... horrible with interference.,"Sadly this mouse (at least the release I have) is horrible at interference. (My version came with the MX 5000 keyboard.)I had constant lag issues and could not figure out what was going on. I tried updating the software, I tried using it without the software, I tried using the Windows bluetooth and then Logitech's software for that. Nothing I did worked, until I moved my computer into a different room from my wireless router.What Logitech doesn't tell you is that wifi devices and other wireless mice interfere with this mouse HORRIBLY. I don't know if a different Bluetooth adapter would fix the issue, but out of the box, the adapter it came with, this mouse does not function well.When you get it in a room with no interference, it works GREAT! 5 star worthy.I purchased an MX620 and it's updated adapter has no interference issues. I'm currently waiting for my MX1100 to come in the mail so I can compare it to that."
5,Best Mouse ever made even in 2008,"The Logitech 1000 is by far the most well thought out mouse I've ever had. I've been a PC tech for 2 decades and still play Great games Like fear, biosphere, etc. I love the way you can program the buttons and there are more buttons then any other logitech to date. I don't know why they discontinued it, (probably to many returns as it's quite complex) so enjoy the best mouse while you can. I tried the new Razor Launchises (spelled wrong) and the extra buttons are hard to reach even with long fingers like mine. The new logitechs don't have half as many buttons. Some stores still have new ones as I just bought one in a sealed container (very rare). Yes the battery can not be replaced by the consumer but it's still the best."
3,Just one major flaw,"I inherited this mouse from my husband who wasn't using it. I really loved it. My battery needed to be recharged every couple days, but I was working online at the time and gave it a big workout each day. I'd rate this mouse a five except for one major flaw, you can't replace the rechargeable battery (without a kludge) and you can't replace the mouse alone. There was nothing wrong with the recharging stand, just the un-replaceable battery would no longer hold a charge but I had no recourse except to buy a whole new set up, mouse, stand and all. It would make perfect sense to be able to purchase and replace the battery alone. Being able to buy a new mouse alone would at least be a compromise, but having to replace the charging stand as well was just too wasteful and expensive to justify continuing to use this mouse. It was a great disappointment."
4,mx laser mouse,"I like the no batteries. Easy to install.only wish it would beep when it got low on charge- you get a pop up window as far as I can tell and a red light on the indicator on the mouse, but I rarely look at it."
3,Another gimmick from hardware makers.,"Pluses are:+ good, comfortable grip.+ laser technology really makes optical obsolete.+ the mouse itself has very good-looking.+ installation is easy and straightforward.+ got a great bargain from amazon.com and it's on back-order a week later.Minuses include scrolling wheel is flimpsy and choppy compared to the older MX Dou combo. Otherwise, I'd have given it a perfect 5-star wireless desktop mouse."
3,Great but weighs a ton,"I really like this mouse, especially the multiple buttons; seven buttons in addition to the two-way scroll wheel. But I had to give it up after several months of use because of tendinitis. I attribute the pain to the weight of this mouse. I wish there were a wired version."
1,Laser precision in a cordless mouse.,What can I say about it? It is a great mouse. Wonderfully accurate and versatile in many ways. Highly recommended.
4,Ergonomic and perfeft fit ...,"This mouse perfectly fits to you right (sorry lefthanded :( ) hand. This is the best benefit of this mouse. Technology is quite old now (there are better chips/sensors/buttons offered by Logitech and also other major branches)I have pair, one for home and one for work. The older one survive only two days of instant working (with sensor set to on), the newer one survive at least 5 days (i usually left the mouse on recharger during the night).You can even work with the ""Red"" light of battery for next few hours. This is perfect.What is one star minus is, that if you are gamer and you'd like to use some special mouse pads, this mouse sometimes makes random movement in case of ""metalic"" surface. Also the reciever in longer distances became not so powerfull. So for desktop it is perfect solution. For gamers, there are better offers, this is old for gaming, for sure.But I use it for gaming, it is working, so no need to trash it out."
4,Nice Laser mouse no different than optical,I have used Logitech mouse products since 1992 and to say the least I am familiar with their quality products. I have used this mouse and I have to say straight out that I saw no difference between optical and the new line of laser mice. The MX 1000 is a bit of the heavy side and charging lasted ok. I have had other logitech wireless mice last longer on regular rechargeable batteries. Also with using rechargeable batteries there is no need for bulky station and extra cables around the computer. I would tell those thinking of buying this to spend your money on something else either wired or wireless but get an optical one. They will be cheaper not as fancy looking which should save you since your using something that will be under you hand 99% of the time your at your computer. Setup is always a breeze under Win or Mac.
5,The best Mouse I have ever used,I bought this mouse when it first came out a couple of years ago.Every thing about it is great. I really like that it has a craddle to recharge. If your left handed forget it.
5,"One year later, still going strong","I received this mouse for Christmas in 2005, and it became my first wireless mouse. I do lots of gaming, and spend 3-4 hours in an average day on my home computer with this mouse. This is without a doubt one of the best mice I've used - in terms of features, feel & ergonomics, and accuracy. It's perhaps heavier than most mice, but the feet glide across a decent mouse pad just as well, so one won't usually notice.The battery life is great - except for when I forget to recharge it every once in a while. I can go 2-3 days before needing a charge, but it's best to put it back in the cradle every night so you don't get caught without power. These batteries do not get the ""memory effect"", so no worries about charging too much. Charging is actually quite fast, so if you do get caught on ""red"" status and have something to do for 30 minutes or so, that'll be enough to gain hours of further use.Highly recommended - you can't go wrong with this mouse."
5,Excellent Product and Price,"So far I have purchased three Logitech MX1000 Laser Cordless Mice for my end-users. They all love it. It is very precise, and comfortable to hold. Charging it is easy and quick. Not having to swap out rechargable batteries is also a plus."
4,Excellent Mouse,"I really like this mouse - especially the charging stand so that you don't have to fool with batteries. The only thing that could be improved is Linux support. I run Kubuntu and I am not able to assign all of the mouse buttons. I really like Logitech mice, I just wish they would provide drivers for Linux."
3,Chaos,"I originally thought that it would be great to have these poets on a digitized CD format. I now want to re-evaluate my thinking. After 8 hours of looking up poems, I know the table of contents is wrong. The selections by Cummings are not correct and I don't know the right titles. The Spender poem is wrong and I don't know the title. The May Sarton poem is not on the CD at all. After 30 yrs you'd think that Harper Collins could at least identify the poems and poets properly. What a poor way to represent great poets!!!!"
1,Beware! The CD is recorded incorrectly!,"My copy of the collection must be recorded incorrectly. The voices are sped up and sound very unnatural. The recording speed must have been set at the wrong value for each track, because some poets sound like a chipmunk and others sound almost okay. The CD plays the same way on a audiophile CD player and two different computers. I recorded a wav file and varied the sampling rate using Matlab. A technician must have transposed 22050 to 20250 Hz on some of the tracks. Though, the other track speeds don't make sense."
3,Hearing vs Reading,"I'm a self-confessed philistine when it comes to poetry - even obvious and popular poems can leave me cold or confused. And it's not through want of trying.So I thought that hearing poetry read by the author might be enlightening: and it was. This is a good collection with all the famous names from the age of early recorded sounds on thru to the end of the century: Frost, Pound, cummings, Plath. What's odd is how mannered they all sound - even the Welshman Dylan Thomas, who traded on his deep regional roots, delivers in plummy tones."
5,I take this CD set everywhere,"I love slipping this CD on and just laying in my bedroom listening to some of my favorite poets read their own work-it is haunting and beautiful. If this is the sort of thing you like, then you will enjoy this collection and the price is good for 3 CDs full of poetry."
2,Music added detracts from content!,"Beware!...You think you are ordering Ocean surf sounds, and what you get are Ocean sounds dubbed with funky new age music! If you think you are getting nature, forget it. These CD's misrepresent their true contents...If you want relaxing natural sounds than pass this whole label up. Very dissapointing!"
3,Dirty Havana in Stark Relief,"More than a political or social comment on early 90s life under Castro, Dirty Havana Trilogy is a biology tract. It depicts the habits, instincts, and behavior of human animals in the cage of intellectual deprivation, physical starvation, and social morass.Devoid of dreams for a better tomorrow or the knowledge of where the next meal is coming from, immediate physical relief -- whether brought on by food, water, alcohol, sex, or violence -- becomes the only thing attainable in Gutierrez's bleak panorama. And when the squeeze is on, his lab rats do all manner of hideous things to one another to get it.I picked up the book on a whim on the hope that I'd get an insight into contemporary Cuba. I finished the book thinking that I had instead just gotten a tour of hell, the variety of which exists in any number of poverty-stricken areas of the world. But while it lasted the tour was compelling, vivid in its savagery."
3,Bukowski in the tropics,"For all of the umbrage taken to the comparisons to Genet and Miller, Gutierrez compares to no one more closely than Charles Bukowski. The subjects are the same: alcohol, sex, sloth with a self pity chaser, the mundane details of minimum wage life. The techniques are the same as well: short sorty minimalism, terse, brutal and claustrophobic.As with Bukowski's compilation-style novels, it would be a mistake to say that Dirty Havana is great literature, but it does very effectively deliver the author's day-to-day experience. Grinding meditation on hunger, filth and lust may simply not be to your taste - compare to olives and licorice as similar love-it or hate-it kinds of food."
5,the real havana,"Pedro Juan can be distasteful, offensive in all his books, but for somebody like me who was born and raised in habana, and walked and live in the underground life I will said is sad, but real. stop making that comments about when you went to cuba I meet and saw a beautiful paradise. My Cuba is beautiful and full of contrasts, also full of horror, believe me."
1,Waste of Money,"Dirty Havana Trilogy in summary, is a compilation of the author's sexual escapades. I bought this book with the hope of getting an insight into the life, society and situations of Cubans. I was quite disappointed. There is no storyline or aim to this book and I am still trying to figure out WHY this book is highly recommended. Its the last piece of writing I will buy of Pedro Juan Gutierrez!"
1,"Boring, Beastly & Base","Inspired by the N.Y. Times review comparing Gutierrez to Jean Genet, I bought this book. Don't!!! It is an vulgar catalogue of cheap sexual encounters without credibility, taste or eroticism. The main character is unendearing, the episodes predictable, and the language banal (to be fair, perhaps due to the translation). Why would all these attractive women -- young and old -- take up with such a scruffy, lazy, worthless, drunken, mooching bum? I kept reading ""Dirty Havana Trilogy"" awaiting insight into modern Cuba or Pedro Juan. There is none. This is not a modern Cubano ""Tom Jones,"" this is trash!"
1,Of Little Merit,"I have read all of Bukowsky and Henry Miller and I respect and admire both of them at their best. I am not easily offended. But I found Pedro Juan Gutierrez's book artless and tedious, the sex quickly boring and repetitious, the insight into Cuba (as I prepare to leave for that country) negligible. As Truman Capote has been reported to have said: That's not writing; that's typing. Major disappointment after the reviews I read on Amazon."
1,Beware - a mental traffic accident,"Leaving the book's artistic merits aside (and they are considerable) I post this review merely as a warning. If you are someone who ""enters"" books as you read them and internalizes the mental images they conjure, then you may wish to avoid reading this book, especially the short chapter entitled ""Stab Her, Man"". If you have read ""American Psycho"" and wish you hadn't, not for any moral or aesthetic reasons, but simply because some of the horrific images are unnecessary additions to your mind's imagination, then you may be familiar with the risks."
4,Mosquito be gone,We use skin so soft to ward off mosquitoes. We've used othr products and found this to work the best. The price was good and shipping was fast. Thank you.
2,Not good if perfumes bother you,"This stuff works but the smell gave me a migraine. It's only mildly ""perfumey"" but it was enough to give me a migraine. It repels bugs very well and is very light on the skin, not real oily. My mom bought the bath oil and I got the Skin So Soft Unscented Bug Guard. Her wearing the bath oil around me was enough to bother me."
2,Not original,Was not the original. Don't buy it if your looking at pic hoping you got original. It's the new thin stuff.
2,Doesn't work like it did when I was a child.,"I don't know if that's the fault of my skin changing, the product formula changing, or what, but this stuff worked wonders to keep bugs away and skin soft when I was a child and now, 20+ years later, I not only break out in a rash from it, but it also did nothing to prevent all the mosquitos in NJ and on Kauai from finding me absolutely irresistible. So not only was I covered in bites (I'm allergic and they become palm-sized, hard, insanely itchy welts and I run a fever), but I also had a lovely rash to fill in the gaps between bites."
5,Skin so soft,In my opinion this is one of Avon's best products and have used it for years. Product arrived on time and as specified.
2,Not pleased,"I purchase this bath oil as a mosquito repellent after reading all the reviews. I received the product just on time to start using it on my kids since its non toxic. My kids went out to play and came back with mosquito bites, I've tried it on them on three different occasions and they still come home bitten. Sorry, didn't work for me."
5,Great product,I've used skin so soft for many years. I use it from a spray bottle in the shower after washing and leave it on without rinsing. I use the spray bottle to prevent using too much. Too much leaves an oily layer on my skin. No other product I've tried leaves my skin as soft.
4,Works well for fly spray,Use it for fly spray and it works without drying the pores. Also keeps my horses coat soft as long as the mix isn't too heavy.
2,Very Oily,"I've used Avon products off and on for years and I have to admit I have tried Skin So Soft on more than one occasion. I tried using less and less in each bath but the truth is that it is too oily for my skin. I love the smell of it but even when using a tiny amount in a full bath I feel like I just bathed in an oil slick. It also clogged my pores and I ended up with pimples on my back and thighs. So it's just not for me, a person who has normal skin. However, to be fair, my mother used to use it and she loved it but she had extremely dry skin. My recommendation is if you have very, very dry skin this can be a plus. Otherwise keep in mind the oily factor. If you're not sure of how your skin will react, try using baby oil in your bath first. It's a great softening agent in the same way as this product."
2,Ago skin so soft,"EEHH. , its just like baby oil with a different smell , but you pay a lot more .Won't buy it again ."
2,smells a lot like mosquito repellent...,"Ok, so it makes your skin feel soft, but not any softer than baby oil but unlike baby oil which comes in lovely scents, this smells a lot like mosquito repellent. It's no wonder it's known to repel them!"
3,Avon Skin so soft ingredients must have been changed,"I love the original Skin so soft bath oil. However last Spring I ordered 12 bottles from Avon online and was very disappointed. Fragrance is faint and dissapates....I was hoping to find someone on Amazon that may be selling some of original formula. I love the way it use to smell and lingered in my bath/ room, and the scent stayed on skin."
2,Packaging and Fragrance Need Improvement,"You'll have to transfer this into another portable container if you want easy dispensing. The entire lid comes off, making precise dispensing impossible.The fragrance needs to be improved. Can it smell less manly and still repel bugs?"
4,Skin so Soft....for my dog,"I don't use this myself but I do use it on my dog. She has very dry skin so after I bathe her I mix one cap of Skin so Soft with a gallon of water and pour it over her (do not rinse). It helps control the dry skin, but doesn't cure it. It smells okay too. Another benefit is that it is supposed to be a bug repellant which is good durning mosquito season. The negatives..it's kind of pricey and for some reason it took forever to get delivered."
3,Skin So Soft,"I purchased this to us as a natural way to control fleas on one of my cats, and to ease hot spots on her skin where she had lost some fur. The results is still out, since she did not like the spray bottle I put it in."
3,Not cracked on the smell,"I hadn't had this product in years and decided to try it for use on my back, which becomes very itchy in winter. It is so liquidy, it is hard to apply to the back. All in all, I'm not that thrilled with the product for this use and I'm not keen on the smell."
5,"Definite Mosquito Repellent, but Fly Repellent too?","This definitely repels mosquitoes (I've been using it for years to keep bugs away), now I heard from a friend of mine that she uses it on her dogs to keep the flies away... perfect."
3,Ordering a Book,"The book took a long time to arrive. However, it was received in excellent condition."
2,"If you're expecting a cook book, you will not be pleased","I purchased this book because of a segment I watched on NBC's weekend morning show. The author spoke of her book and demonstrated a recipe or two. I though it would be a nice addition to my cookbook collection, however I was extremely disappointed.This book is overloaded with stories and family photos rather than recipes and photos of the prepared dishes.Coming from an Italian family I can tell you that the recipes in this book are a bit bland. I was disappointed to read the recipe for tomato sauce, calling for garlic powder as opposed to fresh, crushed garlic!"
4,A BEAUTIFUL COMPOSITE OF FOOD AND LOVE,"I am very impressed with ""Cooking With My Sisters"" since it is not only a beautifully composed book but one that taught even mea thing or two. The recipes for dishes I am familiar with and many that I've cooked over the years, are still welcome sincethere are, in some cases, interesting variations to my usual preparation. The pictures of the ""finished products"" are so life-like I reached for a fork. They smell wonderful, too!The helpful hints throughout are great! Who among us can't usea clue or two?The inclusion of family photos and notes from Nonna are delightful and give this presentation a personal touch. While I enjoy cookbooks showing beautiful Italian scenery, I enjoy even more ""meeting"" the people who were involved in creating all of this good food. Italian families exude love through their food and ""Cooking With My Sisters"" is FILLED with love!"
2,Big Disappointment,"This writer is very simplistic in her vocabulary and writing; the organization of the book itself was poorly done with recipes running together page after page after page. Many of the Italian recipes were not genuine Italian recipes, but American Italian. To her credit, she expressed a love of family."
5,Love This candy,I love these reese's Peanut Butter Cups. I gave them out for Halloween and everyone loved them. They are the greatest!
5,I love peanut butter cups,I love peanut butter cups! And this was a much better deal than buying the equivalent quantity at the supermarket.
4,"good book, though sometimes confusing","I can honestly say that the language in here is hard. It may be just me, though. Either way, some good concepts in here about universal forms and the soul being from different metals...good book. Not leisure reading, but sure is good for if you need something to STUDY...boy will you need to study..4/5"
5,An excellent oral history of the band by its members.,"The band Wire has always been an enigmatic enseamble. In this book, Kevin Eden has gathered the original band members to talk about their history, their creative methods, their goals, and of course their music. The results are very illuminating, not only for those with an interest in this band, but for anyone curious about the dynamics and interaction that come from being in a rock group. All in all, a very readable and complete document (and eyewitness) of an interesting musical experiment."
5,no problems,I've been using Verbatim discs for a long time and I've maybe had 4 or 5 coasters out of 900. I used to always wait for the Sunday ad to see where they were on sale at. I never thought about it until recently that I could just buy them from Amazon. The price is always good on amazon.
4,Made in Taiwan Excellent product,"I've been using Verbatim CD-R discs for years and have had excellent results. It has been my experience that rarely have I had a ""bad disk"". I use the CD-Rs regularly at work for my job and these disks have always seem to be of the the highest quality and reliability. In the past 3 years, I started using DVD+R regularly with the same reliability. I would recommend this brand as they are an excellent value for the money."
2,Unreliable,"About 3/4ths of the way into the stack, I started getting bad discs, they wouldn't finalize or stopped recording, with error messages. Switched to Taiyo Yuden, and it's working fine. I wouldn't buy these again, it's a huge waste of time to have to redo things. The TDK -R discs work well for an economy disc."
5,great DVDs,"Haven't had a ""coaster"" yet using these DVDs. You can't go wrong with Verbatim and these were priced very competitively (cheaper than Costco or Sam's Club)."
5,Best blank DVDs ever,"I love these things. I set Nero for ""max speed"" and they routinely burn at 20x maybe 24x, verify 100% every time. Wish they'd stay a consistent low price..."
5,Pretty much the standard,"I've found that for day-to-day use on non-critical data just about any brand will do. Bad disks have gotten to be relatively rare. That being said, there are just some data that require a higher assumption of media integrity. My reviews of the reviews have indicated that Verbatim meets all reasonable standards for same and I now try to use them exclusively. They tend to be a bit more pricey then some of the other well-known names, but shop around. You'll find them on sale somewhere."
5,great cheap and fast delivery,Got here on time and works great as usual for verbatim.I bought memorex and i had a bunch of bad dvds.
4,good discs bad shipping,"the shipping was free. I ordered 2 hundred packs. They used those pillow bag packing things and needless to say 2 heavy 100 packs in a small box. Both were broken open at the bottom, one with the spindle no longer attached at allAbout 8 discs ran around loose in the box with the broken up pieces of plastic. Threw them out. Wrote it off to free shipping now costing less than 3$ still not bad"
5,These are the famous MCC004 top rated archival media,"These are Verbatim MCC004 media made in India. Along with Taiyo Yuden, these are the best quality media you can buy.Ignore any ""reviews"" that ding Verbatim for Amazon's packaging. Ignore any reviews that say they are poor quality. These reviewers should clean the dust mice out of their burners, update their drivers/firmware or buy a descent burner.These are the best. Name a better quality media. There are none better!"
5,NO MORE COPY PROBLEMS,"I have been having problems with copying DVDs for a long time until my software company reccomended Verbatin DVDs. It solved the problem. I had been using the more common brands and they would skip and freeze up during playback. Some far, so good with these."
4,Excellent Value,I bought this product after using Memorex RW DVD's which was absolutely trash with unusable DVD copies 50% of the time. With this product so far I burned at least 30 and encountered only 1 bad DVD - therefore much better performance - I think I will stay with Verbatim for a while.
4,"Verbatim 16x DVD+R, 100 discs","Great discs at a good price. Burned 47 so far, no coasters yet. These discs are the best I've used."
3,more than 1/3 DVD is bad for vidio,I am using the DVDs to convert my old VHS tape. It is very frustrating that more than 1/3 of DVD are bad.
5,Great DVD's,"You can't get any better DVD's for the price, every burn has been perfect. Verbatim's quality is second to none."
1,DON'T BUY!!!,"These disks are totally unusable. I tried several from different parts of the stack, and my computer will not recognize them at all. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, they have a very bad chemical smell. I can't tell where this lot was made, but it was a total waste of money!! I thought that the Verbatim brand name was a trustworthy one, but they have really screwed up with their DVDs. Don't buy these!!"
1,do not buy,"Don't buy these.I tested these discs on FOUR different computers. No luck.I even had my Macbook Pro DVD-RW drive replaced at the Apple Store only to find out that a new out-of-the-box drive doesn't burn these either.I left the discs spindle at work and nobody could burn anything either.Unfortunately I couldn't figure out whether the ones I bought were from India as other reviewers said.I burned around twenty from different parts of the spindle, so this is not the regular the-first-five-discs-are-bad problem.Stay away from these."
1,Service was poor- not Prime as advertized when I ordered,"I ordered based on getting 2-day delivery using my Amazon Prime prepaid delivery (I HIGHLY recommend doing this if you buy 10 or more items a year on Amazon - ). However, the confirmation showed 3-7 days delivery. When I tried to cancel with the provider/vendor, my request was ignored (never a response) and Amazon had no way to help me out of the order that I needed much sooner. I finally got the order within that much longer window. I like the product, but am apalled that Amazon let this vendor play the switch game on the delivery. I notice Amazon pulled the Prime statement, but that did not help me. I had to buy on the outside to get the product in time and now have double the number I needed. DO NO USE THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU HAVE A TON OF TIME TO WAIT AND CAN NOT FIND FUJI (a 100% clean set - never a miss vs 92%-95% reliability on Verbatim)"
3,Mostly ok.,"When a disc works it works well, but every 5th or 6th one seems bad. I guess that's to be expected in mass produce media like this, but I'd rather see just one or two fail in a batch."
4,Almost A Winner,"I use a lot of discs and decided to give Verbatim a shot because it had a good reputation. The price was not bad and the delivery was excellent. I have used a dozen or so of the discs so far and have had no coasters. There is one big problem and the reason I took off one star. There is more writing on each disc than in a bill passed by congress. There are letters, numbers, punctuation marks, rectangles, straight lines, and a big wavy line above the center hole. That is only a part of the annoying printed mess. I write a fair amount of information on each disc to identify the contents. I don't want to compete with the endless and useless markings already stamped on the disc.These discs record as expected but my next purchase will not be Verbatim. If I want to do that much reading I will finish reading War and Peace."
1,Would Not Record in Magnavox Recorder,"This product would not record in my Magnavox recorder. I have never had a problem with an other brand of dvd+r including Sony, Memorex and even el-cheapo, Staples. I returned the dvds.Amazon did give me a full refund including my shipping costs. So, since Amazon will refund if the dvds don't record you may want to give them a try. Others claim good performance from this product."
1,made in UAE,"they're made in UAE the worst of the bunch by verbatim, i'll be finding another supplier"
2,They Don't Play on Other DVD Players,"I had been using Verbatim discs from Amazon for years -- in particular, the Verbatim DVD RW. Recently, to save some money (I thought), I bought a 100-disc spindle of the Verbatim DVD+R at Amazon for around $30, which seemed like a good price.Problem is, while they record similarly, you can only play them on the the DVD player they were recorded on. So, they work, I guess, but only in a very limited sense. I use two other players -- and they're worthless on them. This is frustrating, and a real drag.Stay away from these discs if you want to play them on ANY other DVD player. As the Romans used to say Verbatim: Caveat Emptor."
1,Do not buy DVDs on Amazon!,I love amazon. But dont buy any CDs or DVDs from amazon. The packaging is just terrible. I returned once and even the second time was terrible even after specifically asking them to pack good. The box was broken and the DVDs scratched. I surely expected more from Amazon!!!
1,Good buy,"I received them, they are the best, i have tried many different brands, verbatam are the best on the market"
4,"Great media, bad search engine!","Well I have to say that it was late at night and I should have been reading closer. These are really great disks. Problem is I did an Amazon search for LIGHTSCRIBE DVD+R and when I saw these in the results (3rd for relevance) and saw the price and rating I ordered them. Wasn't until after the order was being processed and I checked the status that I noticed that there are not lightscribe disks. So now after saving enough $$$ to finally Lightscribe all my videos I need to start saving all over again. So yeah I guess I should not order late at night anymore, but I really wish Amazon would work on their search engine querry a little more. Anyone want to buy an unopened case of Verbatin BRANDED dvd+r's? And again, I have used these before and yes there are REALLY great disks. IF I weren't looking specifically for the LS-DVD's I would definately keep them."
4,trustworthy,"I would buy these disk's again, really good for the price, Good value for your Money. I don't trust any other brand because I have had many headaches with other brands"
1,Let Down,I have burned hundreds of Verbatim disc with great results until I received my November order. My LG burner will not complete a burn with this shipment. The Verbatim DVD-R were ok but no luck with Verbatim DVD+R.
5,Best discs on the planet,"I've burned over a thousand of these discs, and found about three bad ones in the whole lot. At less than a quarter a disc, that's amazing."
1,Paperweights,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not the Verbatim product you may have bought in the past. These disks were unable to be read by any PC I tried them in including a new HP DVD/RW drive and one of the best DVD/RW drives ever made, the Plextor PX-716A. The key to finding Verbatim blank DVDs that will work is in where they are made. These Made In India disks are useless. Found some Verbatim #97175 disks at a store, which were Made In Taiwan, and they work great. Unless you can identify where the disks were made, you're taking a big risk. Luckily, Amazon had UPS pick up my order for a full refund without any hassle. Thumbs up to Amazon, thumbs down to made in India Verbatim media. And kudos to other reviewers who alerted me to the difference in product based on where they were manufactured."
1,Worst purchase ever!,Mine were packaged fine but so far about 60% have been coasters. What a product!
1,Verbatim DVD+R Recordable disc FLOPPED!,"Previously, I had success with only Verbatim disc, but this batch of 100...WOW! I have thrown away more disc for MEDIA NOT PRESENT...some may say it's my drive, but I beg to differ! I've tried 3 different drives with the same result (MEDIA NOT PRESENT)! I've read that INDIA is making the disc now. I can't verify the maker of my disc, but I know that THEY ARE HORRIBLE! I would tell you to STAY AWAY FROM VERBATIM, but I WON'T until I get thorough with this...BUT, I do know that this batch of 100 are THE WORSE!"
1,Stay away from Amazon,Amazon still doesn't know how to ship spindles. They show up at your door broken and crushed. You are much better off going to your local store and paying less for the same product in better condition. Stay away from amazon!!
4,Far better,"Comparing to best buy, it was reasonable fair price. The package were in good conditions, will buy it again if I need more."
1,Shipping problem,"The shipping from these folks leaves a lot to be desired. The box rattled. When I opened it it had very little packing material to secure the contents. I had read there were previous shipping problems on this item, but I've shopped Amazon successfully for years and have had no problems. So I thought this would be corrected. This is really inexcusable. The spindles' base was broken off. If this is the future direction of Amazon, there isn't going to be an Amazon."
2,"Good product, no rebate, no recourse","As stated, my rebate never appeared. There was no recourse to follow-up and Amazon washed their hands of the matter. Verbatim service was non-existent. I'll buy product on sale, but will never hassle with rebates again with these guys.5 stars for product minus 3 stars for poor service and no rebate."
1,DVD are mislabled,"I purchased the discs because the price was great. Unfortunatly, I found that the dvds are mislabled. They are no 4.7 GB. They are 4.3 GB. Meaning that the typical DVD cannot be copied to there discs."
5,A++++,"This brand is a great brand. But I have to say it is not much different that any other brand like them. I suggest everyone buy the R+ disk always, cause with R- you cannot erase and start over, with a R+ you can erase and redo, etc etc.Not alot to say. Great item for price. Great item in general. Great value. All is good.Overall:A++++Two thumbs upNeutral to all other major DVD blank brands."
2,My Own Fault,"While I was expecting to buy ""Printable"" DVDs, when they arrived I discovered that they were NOT the printable type. When I went back and reviewed the sale I found that nowhere did it say that these were supposed to be the printable type. So, while I'm not happy with the transaction, I have to blame myself for not paying closer attention.While the disks will function as designed, they don't suit my needs. I need disks that I can print labels directly onto them (I tried the paper labels .... BOY! wast that a disaster! They wrinkle and peel off after a couple months. I'll NEVER use paper labels again.)"
5,Good Product,These are wonderful disks. Used many times before and always works. Always trusted the name and Amazon has good Dvds to but sometimes these are cheaper I am a value shopper.
1,"Do not buy this now, not this batch","I bought this 100 spindle just recently. It arrived OK but when I tested three blanck disks, all of them failed. I decided to return the rest.I bought this 100 DVD+R 4.7G packet because of Verbatim's reputation and my great experience with DVD+R DL 8.5G which was perfcet and had no issue at all. I do not know what happened. Maybe it was just a bad batch. My DVD burner was on a new Dell laptop and was OK on Verbatim DVD+R DL. The 8.5G was made in Singapore whereas the 4.7G was made in Taiwan."
1,Disks arrive as 100 loose pieces,"Packaged by someone out to destroy Amazon. 100 loose DVDs arrived instead of a spindle. For $30 it's just not worth the bother to fight Amazon over this disaster.Don't make the mistake I did and trust that the DVDs will arrive intact. You have been warned. Come to think of it, I think I was warned too. Check our the other reviews."
4,No problems so far,"I needed to find an inexpensive media for the kids to use. They aren't careful and go through several copies a year of their favorite movies and TV shows. Verbatim seems to be highly rated in most of the reviews, so I tried them. So far so good. The price was certainly right, and the discs arrived in great shape. I can recommend this media."
3,"Declining quality, and not so hot shipping","I ordered several of these DVD spindles and they're very heavy. They were shipped together in one box (free shipping) with next to no packing material. I don't even know why the little bit of packing material was included as it did nothing to protect the items. Obviously, items this heavy need to be packed so they can't roll around and smash into each other during transit. The DVDs themselves arrived okay, but some of the spindle holders were broken.I have bought lots of these Verbatim DVD+Rs over the years, and the quality has consistently gone down. They weigh much less now and the outside edges are rough instead of smooth. The hubs also have defects in the plastic that didn't used to be there. The last ones I bought on Amazon (2010) say they were made in the United Arab Emirates."
1,HORRIBLE! Stay away from these,"Made in India, not Singapore. 2 out 5 discs burn with errors. When will Verbatim learn that the India plant is a mess? Stay away from these discs."
4,Good choice nice price,"If you are looking for inexpensive DVD media, then this is an excellent choice. It performs well and I rarely have issues with burning coasters."
1,Quality of blanks,Just to note I always use Verbatims but this spindle of blanks are terrible been through almost 50 out of the 100 that are bad no need wasting my time with the other 50 blanks bought a 100 spindle pack of the same brand name from another seller and they worked perfectly as Verbatims are supposed to work. But I do give them thumbs up on their shipping the package was packaged excellent.
1,Were a great DVD,"Having brought approximately 2000 of these disks over the last 5 years and they have worked GREAT it is easy to recommend them. I have purchased many different brands before and none of them can compare. I've have had good success over the years with Verbatim quality and they used to be worth the extra few dollars. Sadly this is no longer the case, you may need to look elsewhere, I am disappointed. They are now made in India, so even though they have the same product code as the ones that used to be made in Singapore or Taiwan, they are not up to the same standard. Amazon is starting to slip on quality because of GREED what a shame."
1,So real..,"The picture does not look at all like I imagined the real thing to look. The sewing is as roughly done as one can imagine, There are only 2 rough seams, someone slapped the velcro in front, and maybe they all don't, but mine even smelled like sheep. What's worse, I tried to return this and couldn't get in touch with anyone at the company, but that's not the product issue. Anyhow, in the picture it looks cute and cuddly, but in real life it is not at all. The white material on the outside is a rough cotton that feels like burlap, there was no attempt to make it look good, but maybe for a 100$ piece of real wool the rustic look of it was the point. If I ever go to the Arctic and need something to put inside a sleigh I will have just the thing."
5,deal with it...,"the darkest sides of human nature are not always easy to look at - but there is a value in doing so. and there is a value to those storytellers amongst us who can live inside the heads of characters as venal, narcissistic and evil as these.i loved Indiana's writing. his descriptions of, say, the industrial wastelands of newark, new jersey are downright beautiful, and surprising, drawing parallels between the characters in the novel and the environments they find themselves, and besides I like a good run on sentence since I'm not the sort of person who believes in strict formulas or is immune to the charms of an idiosyncratic intellect suffused with style exercising little restraint in turning a phrase.not a book for everyone, but I for one will be seeking out and reading other works from Indiana."
3,"A satirical account of a Con woman who leaves a path of destruction throughout the USA,","Reading this novel was a little like reading screen scripts for a TV drama series. The book seems to have a cast of thousands and often with only a small walk on part. Evangeline, the principal character, is a con woman of your worst nightmares. However, Indiana's characters seemed to me very unlifelike and lacking any emotion whether they were the victims or the perpetrators. Evangeline mercilessly swindled and murdered her way throughout the book but often I felt nothing for her or her victims. The fact that Evangeline had been having an incestuous relationship with her son Devin from a very young age disconcertingly left little impression on me. The title of the book sums up my opinion of it, ""Depraved Indifference""."
1,"The real ""Mickey Landry"" speaks","I was the model for Mickey Landry in Indiana's latest faction. Having actually been on the Kimes case before Kimes became chic, I must say that the satirical portrayal of this deadly mother son team, does nothing but trivialize their crimes. I would rather see thought provoking exploration into how the mind of a female predator works. What makes Sante Kimes tick? What could have possibly happened to her to create such a monster. She is not a comic character, or some sort of twisted folk hero. She is truly evil. The style of Indiana's writing is not what bothered me, rather it was the flippant treatment of quiet, seething and pathological evil which is glorified and its victims satirized."
2,Mostly Boring!,"The story went back and forth between interesting and boring. There was too much filler of boring conversation and discriptions. If Ms. Busbee would have left out the filler stuff, she would have had a good short story. Sometimes, the story you have to tell doesn't have to take 406 pages. Also, the passion was good but lacked in discription. Funny, when everything else was described in boring detail. I have read 3 of Busbee's books and only one was really good. I don't think I should chance another one when there are some really excellent authors out there to keep me intertained like Madeline Hunter, Rexanne Becnel, Candice Proctor, and Heather Graham to name a few."
5,Lovers Forever,Good and entertaining; though I found it a bit slow in getting to the main plot!I will continue to check for her novels!
3,"Could be better,could be worse...",I found this model to be less sturdy then some of the other brands I've built that cost less money. I was also disappointed in the building instructions ( or lack there of ). I have a bunch of pieces left over that I have no idea what to do with. The end product still looks pretty good so not a total disappointment.
3,I just finished this book minutes ago...,"and all i can say is - how many times can one woman ""go limp"" in one book? The story was pretty good but it seemed to lack depth in some way. There was a lot of repeating of phrases and actions. Also, some of the dialog was way too hokey and irritating, making some of the potentially better moments unbelievable. I enjoyed ""Dreamcatcher"" much more than this one. Sad to say I was a little let down."
2,Way too wordy...,"The back of the book was more interesting than the contents. The plot lost its punch halfway through the story and the book was destroyed by the pretentious descriptions of the ""proud warrior"". I finished it but I skipped most paragraphs that contained words like ""proud, fierce, warrior, ancestors"" etc. All in all, it was just okay."
5,One of her best,"This is the book that made me a Dinah McCall/Sharon Sala fan. The emotions, the power to move you, the prose to take you to another place over and over again are found in this book. From the first scene you are riveted to the love between two people and you feel the overwhelming pain of the sacrifice they each give that love. Their loss is your loss; their pain and their joy are also yours. This is a keeper."
1,Product dose not work as stated!,the copy of dvdcopy xpress on the disc is corupted. they company has tech suport but they can't help you with this part of it do to legal problems. i wish amazon had told me of the problems. i hope this helps someone from get the raw deal i got.
4,BOB JOHNSON A MAN WITH ATTITUDE AND POWER,I ENJOYED THIS BOOK ABOUT BET FOUNDER BOB JOHNSON. IT WAS A GLIMPSE INTO THE LIFE OF A POWERFUL MAN AND HIS RISE TO FORTUNE AND FAME. HOWEVER I WISH MR. JOHNSON WOULD WRITE HIS OWN BOOK. SO THE READER COULD HAVE A CLOSER INSIGHT TO HIS FEELINGS REGARDING THE REASONS WHY BET DIDNT DEVELOP INTO A MORE USEFUL TOOL FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY. WAS THE REASON MR. JOHNSON'S NEED FOR POWER AND MONEY FORGETTING CONTENT ?
1,"Hearsay, speculation and gossip","This book was a waste of time, as are most unauthorized biographies. Mr. Pulley could have better spent his time researching a topic about which he could have gathered all of the facts. I find most unauthorized biographies full of hearsay, speculation and gossip--designed to appeal to the masses so that the author can make quick money. Don't waste your money on this book, and don't allow Brett Pulley's expose' to determine your opinion of one of the most respected African Americans in the world. If you feel you must read it, then borrow a copy from the library.I admire Mr. Johnson because he had a dream, he laid out his plans, and he pursued his goals. As an individual, he is entitled to his privacy and he has certainly earned respect in the corporate world."
5,Needed Inspiration,I am CEO of what I hope to someday be a fortune 500 company. Its very hard to find mentors or people who can identify with the struggles of being a young entrepreneur. This book served as a form of inspiration at a time when it was truly needed. Its hard being a pioneer in an industry predominated by established Giants. Everybody has a opinion of you and you are constantly being scrutinized and held to different standards than your counterparts. Thank You Mr. Pulley for writing this book. It was informative and will help me to keep my eyes on the prize despite adversity. H. Terrell CEO Common Ground USA www.jimmiehatz.com
5,A non-fiction book that is accurate and entertaining!!!,"After having spent 15 years as a lonely African-American in corporate America, reading non-fiction books about boring business moguls who I couldn't identify with, searching hopelessly for a book which would inspire, inform, and engage me, along came the Billion Dollar BET - at last!!! Brett Pulley does an excellent job of taking a potentially boring, dry subject matter, adds his special author's flair, and creates an entertaining, informative business biography! This human touch invites the reader to not just understand the chronology of Robert Johnson's path to his billions but to also embrace the backstories of the life choices of Bob Johnson. A MUST READ!!"
5,Phenomenal!,"This book is phenomenal! As an American-Armenian and a photographer, I was blown away by the spirit captured in this book."
1,"Valuable Topic, Tough Read","I'm sure a lot of effort went into preparing this book. It is packed full of data.Without question, it is someone's textbook.Myself, I found it unreadable. The text rambles. Examples run on. The layout itself is challenging - small font, little white space; the authors invented their own set of cute icons for various summaries and text and data boxes for which I'd rather just see a small title than to learn someone's codes - granted there's only 10 or so - just a straw on the camel.I do read a lot - from Harvard Business Review and professional journals to current business books - I don't mean to blindly take a shot.Perhaps this style just didn't work for me.I hope other readers will add reviews - at the this moment, it appears just two opposite ends of the spectrum."
2,"OK DVD, Boring, a review from a space lover","Buy one of the Imax space dvd's , you'll be better off. This one is boring.Unfortunately once you open the box, nobody lets you return it.So you are stuck with it.Spend your money on something else."
4,very nice - i found one mistake!,"I think this book is very creative and I love the cultural context in which the recipes are presented. It's rare to find such a book. Many of the recipes are things I grew up eating. It's amazing to find them listed in a book.My only complaint is that I found a mistake, inadvertently, which leads me to wonder what other inaccuracies exist in the book. My father's small hometown (district) was mentioned in the book, but described completely incorrectly in terms of its location. This is nitpicking, I know, but I would think that a native of Bengal would know the geography of his or her state. Furthermore, if the regional differences are in fact relevant in terms of cuisine, then in fact, this error is significant.Overall, a creative book."
2,"Could have been a good book, but....","As a serious collector of Indian cookery publications and keen cook, I was most disappointed with this particular effort. Bengali Cooking seems to be written for a United States audience and is a 'tour de force' satisfying possibly only the author and her family. The trendy pseudo phonetic Bengali spellings add absolutely nothing and only confuse, referring the reader to a poorly laid out and incomplete index, there is nothing wrong with the universal 'garam masala'or other common India ingridients, why alter the names? The recipes, with minimal quantity alterations to overcome copyright no doubt, are nothing new and occur in many publications, festivals and seasons seem to have little bearing on the publication as a cookery guide, a lot of the original ingridients are unobtainable. I was very disappointed in this as a cookery book."
3,Prospective purchasers should read the whole review,"This is not a bad little book for those who enjoy reading about food and the cultural aspects of a cuisine. However, those who are simply looking for a Bengali cookbook will be disappointed. The book does contain recipes but there are not very many and they are interspersed amongst the textual material that makes up the bulk of the book. The format of the recipes are not what most people will expect, as they do not follow the standard, ingredient list followed by instructions format, but rather are the integrated style one finds in much older cookery books. I rather like that myself but most will not appreciate it. This is a nice book for what it is but it is not quite what one might expect from the title."
3,great info on the Bengali food history,"The recipes are not very well orgnized, and the history lesson is great, but not for people who are interested only in food recipes, seems like you have to search forever to get what you are looking for."
4,A cultural trip in a book,"Wow! i never expected to feel like I was back in my old kitchen in Calcutta but I was, the detail in the book is impeccable. This book was definitlely a journey into a bengali kitchen, and has inspired me to cook bengali food the old fashioned way again."
4,Let's Keep This Guy Writing!,"It would be a shame if this author ever gave up on his particular brand of historical science fiction! Although it is truly not very deep, more of the pulpy swashbuckling variety, it is loads of fun! He certainly keeps the reader surprised enough. ""Gypsy Trade"" did have enough emotional content to get me choked up, and that's not an easy task."
3,Assumptions,"Eric Robbins from Booklist states in his review of `The Moon Maid and Other Fantastic Adventures' that ""Barsoom is the name of the lunar realm in Edgar Rice Burroughs' moon tales."" As Barsoom relates to Burroughs' Mars tales and has nothing relevance to another famous ERB novel (`The Moon Maid'), one should perhaps be skeptical as to the accuracy of Robbins' review of this title."
4,Good techniques,"A bit pricey for the limited pages, however it covers a number of very good techniques that can be applied from Photoshop Elements 2. This book has an excellent intro to guide the reader in a logical sequence of setting up the image to start the photoshop process. It has a useful CD and does cover many of the concepts available in PSE 2 which are usually skipped by other PSE users texts."
3,Undecided,"I received this book recently and at first site I was disappointed. It looks poorly put together - the front cover looks like it is a photocopy of another and the pages seem to be of low quality.However, the topics covered in the book seem to be good and I'm looking forward to diving into the book soon."
3,"""I'll never give up because Vincent never gave up""",This is a mockumentary of young Vincent (Andy Bowser) a would-be-inventor who seems to be shy one cup and saucer from the set. All his life he's been out invented by people that give away jellybeans and pizza. This time he is not about to be out invented. This is his last year and he's going to show people what he can do.This is not a mockumentary about inventions but the integrity of the inventors their dreams and those of the people they choose to help them. Can we relate to Vincent's quest and will he finally succeed?This film is low budget and it shows. They're experimenting with dialogue and it shows. Their timing is extremely excruciatingly and infuriatingly slow. I mean really slow. However I thank them for their effort; yet I don't think this presentation is gonna be on the top of any list.
2,limited,"This book is a poor substitute for Thomas Sugrue's ""Origins of the Urban Crisis."" More sensational and less objective, Holloway's weak prose add very little to the important discourse on the fall of Detroit. At best, this book should be considered a supplement (with its unique sources) to more rigorous and thoughtful writings."
1,Great message but..,"I enjoyed alot of the facts in this book and I really enjoyed the excerpts from FBI files and such, but I did not enjoy the main author. This book has some real valid and promising advice, but the author injects himself into the book far too much. This book seems less like advice and more like a publicity campaign for the author. Co-authored by Diane Holloway Ph.D., who did alot of the research and I believe is responsible for the excerpts I did enjoy. If you're a die-hard Detroit fan, then I say go ahead and get this book but be warned the author has a pretty crummy current view of the city that's unfair and biased especially since he doesn't live here anymore!"
1,Sounds Like A Disgruntled Cop Wrote This Book,"Sad to say he can say a bunch of negative things about Detroit. The metro Detroit area sadly does have racial problems between Blacks and Whites. Does he have a problem with Detroit because it is mainly black run? 8 Mile Rd currently divides the whites from the blacks. It is a very segregated town, and just because the city is struggling doesn't make it a bad place.ALSO HOW CAN YOU TRUST A BOOK WHEN HE GETS A LOT OF HIS INFORMATION FROM JACK LESSENBERRY WHO IS A WRITER FOR THE METRO TIMES MAGAZINE WHICH IS NOTHING BUT A SEX MAGAZINE."
4,Relax with a Thundering Rainstorm,"This CD is really calming. Not everyone will believe it, but, it is so.Sometimes when I am quietly listening to the CD, the thunder sounds canstartle me, but, I chuckle and realize that it is ONLY a CD. One nightmy husband woke up and stated, ""When did it start raining?"" I laughedand told him to go back to sleep, it was just a CD. It was wishfulthinking on his part as we are experiencing a drought in Central Florida.I also purchased the ""Thundering Rainstorm"" with enhanced music. It isa relaxing CD, also. You have to buy it and listen to it to believe me."
2,Written like a dictionary,"I find the book complete but written poorly. The author will often begin a pararagraph by mentioninng every exception and fringe case before giving the general rule. This writing style makes it hard to browse and quickly get the point. As a reference, I want to look up a tag and see that tag highlighted in any examples. In this book, I often have to scan though long lists of code to get to the point."
5,Worth every cent,"The scope and goal of the XSLT Programmer's Reference by Michael Kay is precisely defined and adhered to. It is indeed an excellent reference (as opposed to a tutorial) on the subject of XSLT version 1.0.I have given 5 stars to only three other books in the past, and this was for what I regard to be truely remarkable contributions: Design Patterns (Gamma), OOCS2 (Meyer) and Concurrent Programming in Java (Lea). Whilst not as generally applicable as these works, Mr Kay's XSLT-PR deserves its five stars for sheer timeliness, accuracy and quality of writing - not to mention value for money."
5,An excellent language reference,"This is the best XSLT reference I've seen. There isn't a day in the last month that I haven't opened this book to find a ""how"" or syntax answer. Excellent.Keep in mind that it's really a _reference_ book. Don't buy this expecting an XML tutorial. For that matter, even the XSLT tutorial is pretty brief. DO buy it to get a solid, accurate reference for building XSLT stylesheets."
5,Best book on its subject,"I cannot express in words how perfect this book is for xslt. Michael Kay is a genius, and he has put together a complete reference as well as chapters on how to code in xslt. It takes the hassle out of learning the W3C specification. Stop here. Do not buy another book on XSLT. This is the one and the only one you will ever need!"
2,Not For Beginners,"I am an experienced programmer and have several Wrox books that I would happily recommend to any commercial programmer but this one seems to have been written by someone who is well-informed and well-intentioned but somehow distanced from ""real"" work. I want to see classic examples that I can relate to, e.g. sales order processing, but what we get here is poetry, family trees and knight's moves around a chessboard. In other words, an academic approach. Now I've spent all weekend trying to get to the beef but I'm still chewing the Taco. Anyone care to write a 90 page monograph on how to do XSLT? If so, I'm in the market."
2,Poorly organised,"Although this book appears to cover most of the subject area, its disorganised structure make it a difficult companion, both for learning the subject and as a reference.The writer's style is difficult to follow and does not lend well to diving in to learn about a particular area in detail.The author recommends his own product, SAXON, which seems to do things in an unusual and non-intuitive fashion.This book was one of the first to market on the topic. Unfortunately it shows."
1,Look Elsewhere for XSLT Book,"This is the worst technical book I've ever used. There is no organization to it, and there is redundant information, especially in the elements listing section. There are areas that are extremely verbose and make little sense while other areas could use simple, less wordy explanation follwed by an example. This book makes a good paper weight, that's about it."
2,Very tough and unordered reading,"It is a pity but I have to write I am not satisfied with the book. It is kind of a book which does not concetrate on the main purpose of a reading - ""to learn something"". Of course I understand - it is programmer's reference but even so there is a lot of introductory parts which could be done much better.There are parts that are very very talkative and give nowadays ""vain"" information and on the other hand there are parts which should be absolutely more narrative. The book reminds me a kind of ""scientific"" or ""academic"" book. From this point of view it is quite good. It is for people who have time to read it in their labs. It is the book for a long time. You absolutely learn a lot of useful topics but you have to find your own way of reading."
2,OK as a reference,"If you're already clued up on XSLT, this would be a good reference. If you know XML, but want to *learn* about XSLT - it's quite appalling.Its dense, assumes lots of prior knowledge, and is written from the perspective of someone who already knows what he's talking about, so there's no need to explain it any further.The examples don't bear much relation to real world problems, and are concerned very quickly with low level details of the XSLT language. A common question I found myself asking was ""I can see that X does Y to Z ... but why do you want to do this?"""
5,XSLT Inside and Out,"This is a *programmer's* book about XSLT. As such, it is the best I have used simply because it does not gloss over the details concering XSLT and XPath, rather it drills into them so as to give the reader a more thorough and greater understanding. But, it gets even better with fully worked examples.If you're serious about XSLT and want to really understand it, this is the book you want."
4,Informative but not for beginners,"This book is a thorough reference of XSLT. However, don't read it as a tutorial. Before reading this book, I had already read one on XML, and a couple of XSLT web tutorials, plus a few magazine articles on XSLT. That was about enough to understand what this book has to tell you about the details of XSLT."
3,Destined to Be Dog-eared By the Veteran Programmer,"This book will be picked up and flipped through repeatedly, --partly b/c it constantly refers you to other sections almost incessantly-- and will be reliable for anyone who's already learned XSLT.The regular ""Usage"" section for each element and function is very appropriate and well-written.It's not for starting out (well, it _is_ the programmer-to-programmer series), and if you have bad eyes, the gray-background code sections will infuriate you on a late, bleary night.Alphabetizing the functions works well for reference but, as in the hand-in-glove functions like key() with top-level elements (xsl:key), you have to constantly go backward and forward to understand.Hard to understand the section on other processors in places, though the author's Saxon --now a near standard since XT's no longer developed further by J. Clark-- is suitably covered.The glossary is rather sparing, and could do with page number or even at least W3C spec. references."
2,Almost unusable,"This book, as the other reviewers have said, is an awful beginning or reference text for XSLT.I have to whip up an XSL transform only a few times a year, so I never remember exactly how the syntax works. This book is never any help. The introductory sections are not informative, and the reference sections are not well-organized and have no helpful examples.He likes to spend a lot of time explaining in various places that ""technically, this blah blah blah is a valid construct, but no one will ever use it."" Who cares? The book is supposed to help others get their jobs done.Still, I have been able to finish my assignments using this book, so I can't give it 1 star. 2 stars is generous, though, for how angry this book consistently makes me."
1,Pack-in games barely save this product from being useless,"When you first look at this product, it's hard not to get excited aboutSpending hours with Mrs. Pacman. While you can still have a date with her, you will not be using this stick. The absolutely atrocious flimsiness of the actual stick will drive you mad as you unintentionally run into ghosts. The only thing that is cool about this thing is the click-wheel, which almost no game uses.Now, for dischodians out there, the stick has a solid redeeming factor. It's a game in itself. Actually using this thing to play a game is one of the biggest challenges you will ever face. If you are just too good, and have become bored and disillusioned with your gaming experiences, ratchet up the difficulty a bit by using this so-called controller. Seriously, stay away unless you enjoy horrible things, and if that is the case, I value at 9 dollars. I use it as a backup controller when guests visit. If I value their company, I let them use a real controller."
2,Beware - You won't get what you are expecting,"This is a good idea with poor execution.2 stars for the joystick, and 5 for the games that come with it.The good thing is that it comes with 3 games (astropop, frogger, and time pilot). Its good that is has a spinner control like the atari paddle and that's where it stops.The bad:1. It should have come with a game that uses the spinner control which would either be Tron or Tempest.2. The spinner does not currently with with Tron.3. The joystick has too much range of motion meaning the stick leans too far left, right, up and down.4. Gameplay can be awkward using the controller while trying to use the button on top of the stick and playing an intense game.Currently, you should not play more that $30 for this item (about how much the 3 games are worth) because it really isn't utilized by any game I am aware of."
2,Don't bother.,"This is extremely poorly designed -- there is not nearly enough weight in the bottom of the controller, so I often found myself knocking the thing over instead of, say, encouraging Ms. Pac-Man to chase down blue-and-white flashing ghosts.It would be completely useless if it didn't include downloads of several Xbox Live Arcade games, but save yourself the trouble and just download Astropop from the XBLA Marketplace and forgo this controller."
2,Not so authentic,"I found this CD to be a bit stilted in its representation of Gregorian chant. The voices are beautiful, but there are only two or three of them to my ear. The CD notes do not even reference the name of the group or its conductor, but only mentions two singers by name. Even though the CD notes refer to Gregorian chant as ""flowing"" and having its own rhythm, each note of every chant was the same length and had the same volume. This CD would be fine for background music. However, it is not authentic Gregorian chant."
3,Not bad for a novelization,"Of course when you read a novelization you have to adjust your expectations. But as far as noveliations go, this isn't too bad. Dilard does add a whole lot to the story that was up on the screen to begin with, but after reading it back-to-back with Diane Carey's novelization of ""Broken Bow,"" I had to appreciate the craftsmanship Dillard brought to the story. It stood in stark contrast to the cynical, quickies cranked out by Carey.So...don't expect much new (novelizations haven't done much of that since Vonda McIntyre's treatments of TWOK and TSFS), but if you enjoyed the episodes and want to read them in print, this one'll do it for you."
4,One year old likes--board book with holes,"Like other Nina Laden books, this board book has holes. These holes are very appealing to infants in terms of their ability to flip the pages. This story also makes sense, unlike the other Nina Laden books.In this book, a tadpole becomes a butterfly, a chick becomes a chicken, a tadpole becomes a frog, a kitten becomes a cat, and a puppy becomes an old dog.I give this 4 stars because while my one year old enjoys it, it is not a favorite like Brown Bear, Brown Bear or the lift the flap Spot book.Where's Spot? (Lift-the-flap Book). I also highly recommend her book, Peek a Zoo, especially for infants under 1.Ready, Set, Go!Peek-A Who?"
4,excellent,"I have to admit I wasn't counting on much when I picked it up, but it is a great book. It pulls you through really quickly, and the ending is very satisfying. It is quirky and fun, and it seems to be very reflective of the real Key West. I recommend it highly."
1,Worse than amaturish video,"This is a very poorly done video of a lovely area of Croatia. The video has many, long boring scenes of boats, trees, beaches and the narrative is very difficult to understand owing to overly-loud backround noises of cars, motor scooters, hammering, clanking, etc.I rate this one zero-stars - don't waste your money!"
4,Icelandic Kelp,"Kelp contains iodine that can prevent cancer per my readings. I picked Icelandic Kelp since it is collected from 'cold water' sites. Less likely to have toxins remaining in kelp, per my readings anyway. Per product pkg it speaks of washing kelp etc. hopefully this will do what it states. I take one every other day or little less often.Be careful though, study up on any-all vitamins to be sure they are safe for your body and or medical Hx. Didn't give 4 stars only because I don't know if it works but want to take it anyway. Price is good, which could push it up to 5stars?"
2,not as scary as you would think,"It was too slow paced for me. There was too much talk and not enough action. Not really scary at all,and the guy who played the vampire was putting me to sleep."
3,A great sequel!,"This is the second in the Hammer ""Carmilla"" trilogy. Ingrid Pitt, who appeared in ""The Vampire Lovers"" (and in ""Countess Dracula"", not in the trilogy"") is replaced by Yutte Stensgaard,a lovely blond. Some events are a little less than plausible, but overall it provides what I believe the then audience wanted - blood, babes and breasts! If you are expecting ""Gone With the Wind"" you may be disappointed, but I loved it for its place in the ""Vampire Babes"" genre."
3,So wonderfullly bad,"The middle chapter of Hammer's Karnstein trilogy (between The Vampire Lovers and Twins of Evil), LUST FOR A VAMPIRE is a textbook example of the studio's penchant for excess in the early '70s. Fans of classic Hammer fare like Horror of Dracula and Curse of Frankenstein will be disappointed with the weak script and atrocious acting. But if the lesbian vampire sub-genre is your thing, you'll, uh, get off on this film.Treasure or trash, LUST FOR A VAMPIRE looks fantastic thanks to the wonderful folks at Anchor Bay. There's a commentary track that is fairly pedestrian, and the goofy theatrical trailer.If this sort of thing is your cup of T (and A), by all means, sink your teeth into it."
3,Definitely worth a look,"Despite reading some negative reviews about this film I decided to give it a try..I'm glad I did! The Count Karnstein character is cheesy, but all the other parts are well-acted. Yutte Stensgaard is an absolute stunner as Mircalla and worth the price of admission herself! This film delivers in the usual Hammer tradition..great mood setting, solid acting, and beautiful women! Don't hesitate..buy this video!!!!"
3,Not as bad as its reputation.,"Many people say this is one of Hammer's worst, if not the worst. But I don't agree at all. Yes, it could have been much better, but considering the trouble they had making it, it works nicely. Ralph Bates came in when Peter Cushing couldn't do it, and he gives a brilliantly funny performance. I don't know why people hate this movie, it's not any better or any worse than so many other later Hammer movies. Nice sets and atmosphere, what more do you want ?!."
2,Lust for a better Hammer film,"I am a Hammer Film fan, but this one lacks the style and content that other Hammer films contain. The pop music song in the film ruins it. The poor use of Ralph Bates is evident and he could have been used much better as he is an excellent actor. I still enjoyed watching it but like I said, it lacks some.... The DVD quality is good though I am looking for Twins of Evil to be released on DVD. That is a better film!!"
2,a little bit weak vampire fairy tale,"The reasons are:1. A very embarrassing greece dancing2. There are more many women than men in the film except the underrated actor Ralph Bates & the unknown actor Michael Johnson3. The blond danish model Jutta Steensgard is not a famous Horror actress. She played as Carmilla Karnstein a bit boring, she was not really actress but she was a photomodel.4. The same plot 19th century Romanticism (a classic gothic horror tale), which Hammer Film Studio didn't develop the story at all.The most stupid element in the movie:a young writer who fell in love in a female vampire, and could not save her and was unable to protect himself. It looks a bit cheesy, cause you'd already seen this in various Hammer films.2 stars"
3,Lust for a Vampire Movie,"A good adaption of story Carmilla. Hammer films decided to make a trio of lesbian vampire films, (this film, the Vampire Lovers, & Twins of Evil).This is much better than Twins of Evil, & more explicit in its nudity & vampirism than the Vampire Lovers.I remember seeing this on video in the early 1980s when my hormones were a popping - and thus it's always held a special place in my staked heart.The major inconsistency with the plot is that at the vampire's vicitms scream when they are attacked at the beginning of the film, but by the end of the film the last victim's almost in orgasm as she's being attacked - did the vampire just get better at biting?"
5,Lust for the Vampire - It IS a very good movie!,"I don't know why people say this movie isn't good. It IS good. The photography is excellent, the story is excellent, and the acting is very good, too. The music is perfect and is timed perfectly with what's going during the movie. I simply adore this movie. No, it's not scary in the least; I consider it a dark love story. It's one of my favorite movies. It's beautiful to watch! Please give this movie a try!"
2,not worthy of the fante name,"Dan Fante's prose lacks the emotion, snarl, and crisp love of his father's beautiful novels and short stories. His novels are really quite conventional once you get around the thin veil of filthy language and extremely demented characters to find a half-thought out plot and senseless dialogue. His anti-hero is a worthless cop of Arturo Bandini - the only thing worse is his poetry, which wishes it had a sliver of Bukowski's originality and personality --- this stuff is weak."
5,ALBERT C. MARTH,"DAN FANTE AGAIN GRABS REAL LIFE BY THE THROAT! MOOCH IS ANOTHER RUNAWAY CLASSIC BY ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING AUTHORS IN THE U.S. TODAY! DAN PAINTS A PICTURE WITH HIS WORDS THAT DEFINES THE WORLD OF HARD KNOCKS! THE ONLY STRUGGLE THAT I HAD WITH THE BOOK WAS TRYING TO PUT IT DOWN!IF THIS BOOK ISN'T ON YOUR MUST READ LIST, THEN PUT IT ON YOUR LIST TODAY!LONG LIVE BRUNO DANTE!ALBERT C. MARTH"
5,Forever changed,"If you want to trasform or develop a stronger prayer life, this book is for you. This book took me to the next level of praying. I love how the prayers are full of the Word of God and they are short and to the point. Some of the issues they have a prayer for include being a godly wife, procrasitination, healthy eating habits, time management, finances, etc."
5,A splendid example of esoteric ritual!,"In the world of fraternal and esoteric orders, nothing compares to Societas Rosicruciana. This was the order that inspired the Adepts of the 19th century to found the Golden Dawn. Societas Rosicruciana is still alive and well today. It continues to be a driving force in the world of esoteric thought.According to verifiable sources, these are not 100% accurate reproductions of the ritual, but you will get a good idea of what Societas Rosicruciana represents and teaches to its students."
2,A one of a kind manuscript...but still 2 1/2 stars,"This is just what it claims to be. This book explains entry rituals into the rosicrucion fellowship. It explains the preparation ceremony the pass words and basic symbolism of the passwoards, and thats all. No new mysteries are presented, or explained, no glyphs or or secret grips revealed. This makes a good edition to your library but not a particularly useful volume as the philosophers stone was not even mentioned in the sections i read. Maybe one day if i get my copy back from a certain small furry flying creature, i might find something interesting enough to study here. If I was not so interested in the symbolism that was presented I would have returned this for a better thicker volume, Such as Arther Edward Waites Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, much more explanatory with pictures too."
2,Not so Hot or Cold,Pros:1)the mouse pad is a pretty good size (but i didn't buy it for the mouse pad)2)price is cheap maybe that is why no quality to itCons:1) the wrist pad is hard (very hard) a brick would be better for your hand2) it doesn't heat or chill very well (the thick hard wrist pad absorbs all the heat and cold before it gets to your hands3) it gets dirty quick4) did I mention the wrist pad was hardI gave it a 2 star because the mouse pad its self was useful but that is it.I will never recommend this product to anyone
2,Wrong plastic envelope,"Allsop used the wrong type of plastic envelope for their gel cushion. They used plastic which allowed moisture to escape out of the gel and cause the gel to be hard and flat. no way to fix it, it's a manufacturing mistake."
4,Cool but small inside,"This purse is cute and I get a ton of compliments on it. All of the compartments are great. My only issue is I have filled the pockets and put a tiny slim wallet inside and have no room left for anything additional. If I am walking around and need throw something else small in I simply can't because the main compartment is a tad too small. It could use an extra inch of space. All in all I do like this purse, but you might need to be more of a minimalist than I am to get the best use of it."
2,Not industrial strength,"Overall, the system is useable but there are multiple areas of potential improvement. The most important area for improvement is the height of the weight bench. It is too high so there is no way to perform a traditional bench press. Second, the pegs that hold the weight bar in place are positioned where one would normally place their hands. There is no way around this other than narrowing your grip. The fly bars are awkward and tend to bang against the bench support. The lateral pull bar provides resistance through some palstic housing which I am pretty sure will wear out in a short period of time. The weight bench has basically been relegated to my off day strength work outs since it does not provide the stability and support for a vigorous weight session."
1,WHITESNAKE LIVE AT DONINGTON 1990,THE VIDEO SUCKS IT A BOOTLEG IF I EVER SEEN ONE AND IF NOT SOMEBODY DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO DO THE VIDEO IT LOOK LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE 70S IT WOULD BE ALRIGHT AS A CD BUT NOT A DVD I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT
1,Horrible,"THIS MIGHT BE THE WORST CONCERT DVD EVER..I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE OTHER COMENTS, MUST BE A BOOTLEG. IF THIS IS THE BEST THIS RECORD COMPANY CAN PUT OUT THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES! THE VIDEO IS DREADFULL AND THE AUDIO IS BAD. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED. DAVID COVERDALES VOICE SOUNDS TATTERED AND TORN, LIKE A SHREEKING CAT. SIMPLY A WASTE OF MONEY......"
2,Not intended for public use LOL,The problem with this video was it was shot for the concert screen so the fans far from the stage could see somthing. This video was never intended to be seen on your tv screen! Now if you are a Whitsnake fan i am sure you will like it but be WARNED it looks very BOOTLEG. Again it was shot for the concert crowd not for reproduction to be seen on any TV screen.
5,I was there!,"I was in the military serving in the UK at the time of the Donington concert, and I was lucky enough to get to go. Still have the ticket stub and the concert book. All total it was a 13 hour concert with not only Whitesnake, but Aerosmith, Poison, Choir Boys, and Thunder. It was an incredible show, and I have been waiting for this release ever since I heard it was coming."
5,It is what it is...and it's GOOD,"C'mon, people! This was TAPED 21 years ago. T A P E D !!! As in video tape. No digital cameras. No 2011 technology. Most of my favorite bands from the 80's never video taped anything, so for this to exist in any form is a huge plus for me. My iPod and my Sony Cyber-shot digital photo camera record better video than what existed in 1990. I have bootleg concerts recorded within the past few months that look professional compared to this, but the technology in 2011 affords us that. This is a piece of rock history. This is a great concert. A great band. A great DVD to own. I personally love it and enjoyed watching it. I just saw Whitesnake 3 weeks ago and they ROCKED! Get over the quality and enjoy the DVD for what it is - a place in time we'll never get back to. These great, real rock bands aren't going to be around forever. Too soon these DVDs will be our only salvation in a world of boring, cookie-cutter, flavor-of-the-week rock music."
3,"Good camera work and musicianship, but irritating vocals by Coverdale","I'd have to say that this Whitesnake DVD is just ""OK"". The musicianship, stage performance and the camera work is exceptional. But, I was disappointed with David Coverdale's vocals. His voice stared getting irritating after a few songs. If you are a die-hard Whitesnake fan, then you'll probably love this DVD. If not, you might want to skip this DVD and look for another live performance from David Coverdale and the boys. I personally wanted this live DVD because I'm a Steve Vai fan. I used to own a Ibanez Steve Vai Universe 7-string guitar like Vai's and watching him play his Universe brings back memories of how Bad Ass that guitar was. I'm still kicking myself for selling it."
4,"If you're a Whitesnake fan, you'll like this","As most other reviews have stated...great audio quality and not the greatest video quality (resulting in my 1 star deduction). Some of the video doesn't even match up with the audio, which is normally a deal breaker for me on a concert DVD. Regardless, its a cool concert DVD for anyone who was into the 80's rock/metal scene. It showcases Whitesnake's best lineup in my eyes. So, its cool to have some concert footage (with stellar audio) of them in their heyday.If you have any similar genre DVD's in your collection, this one will be a welcome addition."
2,Like a B Movie - Poor Quality - Unprofessional,I have many Music Videos & watch them frequently. I was all keyed up to see this video on the music I love. When this DVD started I noticed it looked like it was out of focus some times. It looks like someone in the seats recorded this video & not professionals. I was very dissapointed in its quality. It goes from Black & White to color & back to Black & White ???? I still liked the video.
2,Guitar software,"Slow loading, locks up frequently in windows XP, overall ok to fair product, needs software patches to resolve buggs"
1,This video is too expensive,I want to see this movie because Ricardo says it is a good movie. But it is just too much to pay for a VHS tape.I will wait for it to come out on DVD.
5,Love these!!,"I saw these little floating bud vases at my cousin's house and had to have them. I love them so much that I bought a set for my daughters and daughter-in-law. They add such an elegant, pretty touch to a table, island or coffee table. I like to pick up cheap little flowers at the grocery store and ""stage"" them in my floating bud vases."
5,Great gift,"A simple but great idea. And it looks good too. It's an Israeli product, but it costs less at Amazon then it does in Israel."
5,STELLAR!!!!!!!!!!,"Simple, smart design stops people in thier tracks. Who knew defying gravity could be so much fun? Use with the bottom plate under a cloth or alone on a conductive metal surface. I use them with gerber daisies on my stainless steel countertop and they stop traffic! Line them up on the top of the refrigerator door. Sharp, witty and well worth the $$$$$!"
4,Ruined by dvd cuts,"I remember seeing this a while ago and it was a kick seeing Joanna Kerns (sexy actress indeed), play a total bitch. It was a nifty little dark cracker, but I have recently bought the dvd release and I noticed that cuts were made for some mild flashes of nudity; simply Joanna's backside getting up. I know it was a tv film, but that's no excuse for these cuts, and it means the censors still treat everyone like kids. It's not good enough. I'm not keeping the film. I want to, but I refuse. I am sick of these censors. Release the film properly will you! It deserves better and it ruined it for me!"
4,"Great teaching tool, but tech is outdated","This is an excellent teaching program, and can be of great use in a Music classroom. I just wish that the screen size was adjustable, and the graphics more up-to-date (it fills only a small center square portion of your screen). Also, BEWARE that this runs on the old PowerPC system, so it will not work on a new Mac running OS X Lion!"
2,Caution!,"You need to have the CD loaded to run the program even after installation. So, if you don't have a built-in cd/dvd drive, you need to carry the add-on/docking station at along :("
1,Does not work with Mac OS X Lion 10.7,"If you intend to install this product on a Mac running OS X Lion 10.7 or higher, this product will not work.I attempted to reach the company (Harmonic Vision), by email and voicemail, to find out when it will be updated but its been over 4 weeks and no reply."
5,Excellent product,"I read online review and purchased the product. It is absolutely worth every penny. Lessons are easy to understand and remember. I finished four lessons and games one night without feeling bored or tired at all. With the help of it, I've already learned how to play some songs on piano. I will definitely use the product to teach my son the basic music theories."
4,Good supplement to Lessons,I have a 7 year old daughter and this product has helped to motivate her to want to continue lessons and practice. She has a lot of fun with it!
3,DOES NOT LOAD ONTO A NEW MAC AND AMAZON KEPT MY COUPON!,IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF MAC OS. I DID NOT HAVE PROBLEMS RETURNING THE ITEM BUT AMAZON KEPT MY $10 AMAZON STORE COUPON THAT I USED FOR THE PURCHASE!
4,music ace deluxe,Very good value. easy to understand and follow. interesting and fun format. teaches music theory so that anyone can understand it.
2,Overpriced and not related to Violin Players,"I bought this for my violin beginner 11 year old on the strength that it had pictures of violin players on the box. I wanted her to get comfortable with reading music for violin. However none of the software is directed at violin players, but rather just to piano players.Though my daughter is bright and very computer literate this software offered her very little in the way of an interesting learning tool. It may be advertized as good for teaching musical theory but it failed miserably to capture the attention of my daughter.We have a lot of educational software (40+ including Edmark by IBM) ranging from Math, Spelling and Typing games and find this package very limited in functionality and consequently very overpriced!"
2,Great!...for personal use,"I feel like I got snookered. This is cool software, but this particular package can only be set up for ten users! Big problem for a studio with 160 students. Not bad for home use though."
3,Stano,"As a reader of many books about true crime in particular serial killers, this i beleive is the first book by ms flowers. She chose to use many chapters to go over the lengthy and monotonous appeals process that follows a death penalty conviction. There is not enough information on victims, while there are 33 known victims, stories are given on about 7. The book jumps around alot and is a book u can definetly put down. Still worth reading cause it does give insight into Stano and his crimes,since there are no other publications that give more than the book. Maybe GERALD STANO although the number of victims is staggering, is just a boring story."
1,Save Your Money,"Written in an amazingly Dick and Jane style, this is the single worst book of any kind, not just true crime, I've ever wasted my money on.Flowers writes in the stacatto fashion of the Dick and Jane books we Baby Boomers grew up with, with about as much detail.After pages of vapid short sentences, Flowers keeps the second half of this book to a frustratingly boring recitation of the trial that sounds as exciting as a typing lesson.It is beyond me why this book was published, but if you are looking for a good true crime read, trust me, skip this one.Absolutely awful, this book is best used by tearing out the pages and using them for dusting cloths."
3,Blind Fury review,"I found this book very interesting and true. I met Stano in 1979, I guess I was lucky that I never became one of his victims. He got what he deserved."
4,"With a sister like that, va va voom!","Hammer does it again with a mix of violence and sex with an unusual twist on Robert Louis Stevenson's tale of mad science and man's lower nature. In this case it is a conflict between man and his female side, and this female is deadly. Ralph Bates and Martine Beswick are astonishingly close in appearance and the latter is truly beautiful. She bares sharp claws, however."
3,WANTED MORE.........,"after all these years of trying find and purchase this item, but disappointed because i thought there wasa longer uncut version of Dr. Jekyl Sister Hyde...it was too short and wasn't as exciting as i once remembered.unless there is an uncut-longer version please forward it to me or i guess i just stay unsatisfied.thanks anyway,mr. LEVI"
4,Works great but beware,"I wired this cartridge according to the enclosed instructions and as a result no sound came out of the cartridge. Upon visiting the Shure webpage, I diiscovered that the wrong wiring diagram was given for this product. It's a price hard to beat, but be aware that the enclosed wiring instructionns are wrong."
4,Shure M78S Wide Groove Monophonic Cartridge,This cartridge seems to work well on old 78 records. I had forgotten how fast 78's spin! You will need an additional headshell because it does not come with one. It is a bit difficult to connect the signal wires because the jumpers making the cartridge monophonic block part of the length of the cartridge pins.
3,What's goin on?,"Well, problem is it's not a truly mono cartdrige.It is a stereo one bridged for mono, so, what's going on Shure?I wanted to buy this one because it states that is a mono one; I already have an M44 bridged and I tough that this one had only one coil, but...it's almost the same with the wires for the bridge, I'm very confused"
4,Good value for the money,"This isn't the world's most durable or high-tech space helmet, but you get your money's worth out of it. The visor is rather flimsy and not hard plastic. Other than that, the toy seems like it would hold up pretty well. My biggest complaint was with the seller, however, not the toy. They shipped the helmet with a different color visor than the image shown here (we specifically ordered from this seller because my daughter wanted a blue visor, not the grey one we got), and the helmet also arrived rather bent out of shape and squished because it had been packaged in a box that was entirely too small for it. With a little coaxing, I was able to form it back to its proper shape, though... mostly."
1,The Plague DVD is suspect,"I received this DVD in good time and in good condition. However, I found the disc unplayable with severe ""chatter"" and ""hesitation"" when played on three different machines. The aspect ratio also was not spot-on. I also was unable to turn-off the Chinese subtitles. I am very concerned Amazon/this vendor is selling bootleg copies of films; a practice of which I want no part. I should have been more wary when I read it had ""... interchangeable English/Chinese subtitles..."". Amazon refunded my money promptly once I asked for a return/exchange. My first bad experience with Amazon. Pity."
4,Quilting directions,"This book gives you step-by-step instructions for choosing fabric, cutting, piecing and quilting. You will need to read it several times to get the hang of it, but keep at it - a great quilt will be your reward."
1,shipping cost outrageous,$15.98 for shipping on a $12.00 item and not eligible for bundling with other order as it's not sold by Amazon.
3,Good,This is a very nice CD of new remixes of hit singles mainly from the the 1980's. One of the better CD's in this series. The cover guy is hot too. Recommended.
2,A lift to a sore neck,"I purchased the ""Matress Genie Bed Lift"" wanting relief from GERD but the only results are a sore neck, backaches and less money to spend on a product that might help. The air leaks out of the lift so I can't keep it at the level recommended. I weigh 120 pounds so I'm hardly crushing the air out. I hope I can return this piece of crap."
2,Mattress Genie,We purchased this product for my mother-in-law because she was having trouble getting out of bed and lacked the strength to sit up without help. The Mattress Genie does inflate nicely but is very loud. One of the biggest problems is that it is very slow in letting the air out of the pillow so that the bed returns to normal after being elevated. Also the process of the mattress raising caused the mattress to scoot down and was putting pressure on the footboard. We thought this might be an inexpensive solution to her problems without having to purchase an electric bed or a hospital bed. The thing we least liked about the Mattress Genie was the slowness in deflating and the noise that occurs when the pillow is inflating.
2,Disappointing,The Mattress Genie I received lost air from the first day. I wasn't allowed return it because it had been opened. (I'm not sure how to use something without opening it...) The dealer (The Wright Stuff) contacted the manufacturer who is sending a new air bladder. But.... do I dare open it?. . .
2,Not Happy,Not very happy with the Mattrees Genie. The product does not delivery what it promises; doesn't inflate as high as it says. The worst part is that it makes the mattress bouncy. When my husband lays down I go up. Everytime you turn over the other person is bounced around.
5,Mattress Genie,I was very skeptical when I saw this product but I decided it couldn't hurt to try it -- I could always return it. It turns out this was the best $89 I spent. I have not slept this well in years!
1,Does not hold air - don't bother to purchase,I just purchased this and it does not hold the air. It's flat by morning. A lot of money and hassle for something that does not work properly. very disappointed. Jane Bucceri
2,Little disappointed,"When I decided to buy this product it was based on the review of others, but I was a little disappointed due to the following :-1- The very loud voice it makes when you try to raise the back. (You can wake the whole neighbourhood)2- You have to either blow it to the maximum or not becasuse in point in middle between complete blown up and flat is usless.Accordingly you have to know that you buy because it is cheap not because it is the best (the Real Electric Back Raiser wont be less than $1500.00)"
5,Just the ticket!!,"This mattress genie was just the ticket for my dad. He was coming home from the hospital where he had been sleeping with his head elevated due to pneumonia. He did not want a hospital bed, but we felt pillows would not be supportive enough. Enter the mattress genie. Works like a charm. Motor is a little noisy, but once you have the angle set it doesn't need to be changed often. It is well built and the compressor is powerful. I did find that on his full size bed I had to wrap a strap around the mattress to keep the other side of the bed from elevating more than the side his weight was on. A good old ratcheting tie-down did the trick and now it all comes up at the same rate. The large lighted control is a plus also. I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to a hospital bed."
4,Mattress Genie review,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my elderly aunt. I was a bit skeptical that an air mattress-type unit could lift a queen mattress but it did it, and it did it well. The maximum incline, while not upright, is quite steep and is great for TV watching. We ended up buying another for my mom.The only downside is that it is quite slow to inflate and deflate, and is noisy during operation."
2,Not great if you sleep alone,Takes 2 people to make this work effectively. Think of a water balloon. The side your laying on will go flat if you don't have someone to balance it out.
1,Don't waste your money,"I had about 2 weeks of great sleep before it started losing air. It sure isn't worth the money. It is noisy, but I could have lived with that."
2,"Genie Bed Lift, Twin size","The bed lift system is OK if all you want to do is sit up in bed and read. However, I did not like the way it bounced when trying to sleep on it and the edges or sides would collapse if you weren't centered in the bed."
4,Mattress Genie,"Installs fairly easily (if you can lift up your mattress) and inflates smoothly and easily. Plug has ""pass-through"" for additional devices, and wired remote control is illuminated (can't turn it off, as far as I know). The only problem is the rate of deflation--it takes a few minutes for the weight of the mattress to squeeze the air out. Otherwise, excellent value, works well."
3,Nice idea - didn't work for us,"I liked the concept of this and haven't seen anything else like it (being able to change inflation rates), but when one spouse outweighs the other by 100 pounds (as in our case)it really doesn't work. My wife was elevated quite a bit above me and it made sleeping very dificult for her. Wish it had worked, but I had to return it."
1,disapointed,I am very disappointed in this product. I have owned two of these genies and they were fine. I decided to order another and was very unhappy when it arrived. It was so noisy you could hear it all over the house. I called the company and they said the motor was bad and they sent me another. it was a little better but not much so I called again and was told that was the way they sounded. I'm so flustrated because I have already had two and none of them sounded this loud.I have never given a product a bad rating but this one really deserves no good rating.
2,"Overpriced,Plastic,barely works,Destined for closet or garage !","150 dollars for a piece of plastic..Ok I see they think they have something here.A mattress raiser that most think that if they get it they wont have to get a adjustable bed..First off its falsely marketed as a working device without design flaws..Read the reviews here without a headboard it slips out or has to constantly be repositioned.. That they fail to mention the designers..Surely they know this..Than i resad about design flaws that cause leakage .Looks like you use for a week or so,maybe a little more than its in shed,garage or basement and its 150 wasted..Buy an adjustable bed it is 2000 and works and use this 150 towards it.Further an adjustable bed is warrantied for 10-20 yrs and you get a mattress to boot,which you have to buy anyhow so the adjustable bed really costs for less than 1000 ."
2,Would Not Buy Again,"I purchased this product to provide upper body elevation for an elderly family member who has Congestive Heart Failure. It just didn't work as advertised. The unit would leak air each night and the inflation/deflation pump was very loud. I ended up purchasing a Pride LL670 recliner (designedto be used as a bed, if desired) and that provided the level of elevation the individual required. The garbage can got the Mattress Genie !"
2,Air Leak,"Many reviews gave complaints about the sound of the mattress genie and leaking air. I wanted to try it anyway. It did leak air. I will probably not buy from Amazon.com again due to the long returnMattress Genie Bed Lift System, Queen/refund process."
1,Mattress Genie doesn't stay inflated overnight,I have several friend who highly recommended this product as they have been pleased.Mine is evidently defective and doesn't hold air.Working on getting the problem fixed.
1,Busted after one month,"We bought this for my dad, a senior who needs to be lifted up from mattress. Like many reviewers pointed out, it is very loud when pumping the genie. We all got used to the loud noise (even with young kids at home), and the only drawback we found was that the flat button did not always work properly.However, five weeks after we purchased the item, one morning while pumping the genie like usual, it bursted. It is unbelievable how short-lived the item is and we were extremely disappointed. We would not consider buying this item again."
3,Good Concept; Needs Some More Engineering,"I bought this product to help relieve a medical condition that requires raising the head at night. The product inflates and deflates well and is easy to set up, the pump was quiet when deflating (noisy inflating, but that's ok because you only raise it as needed). The problem is that it does make the mattress wobbly, particularly on the edges, and the wobble worsens the higher you raise the height. As others have stated, you need to stay in the center of the bed, and especially for the elderly, getting in or out or moving toward the edges at night could be a concern. The size I ordered was a twin for a twin mattress - perhaps the larger sizes for larger mattresses would be more stable - I don't know. I'm returning it and hoping that at some point they'll figure out a way to increase stability, because I think it's a great idea."
4,"Good, however","Well for one, its loud upon starting up, and if you dont have the pump correctly position it groans at you. secondly, it makes your mattress slide down a good two feet, and deep pocket sheets still dont stay on the matteress when you have a bed ridden person in it."
3,Mattress genie,"If you will be using it at home - permanently, it is a good option for raising the head of your bed (if your mattress will bend). If you plan to take it traveling, it is very bulky and heavy. the compressor is noisy. Some mattresses will not bend so it puts you at a very steep incline and sometimes the mattress or you will slide down!! If you try to use it on top of the mattress as a pillow, you have to fill it completely or you will sink into it.Again, if you use it at home in a permanent situation, it is a good choice."
3,Effective but Not All It's Cracked Up To Be,"Product does elevate properly, does hold up, quick to set up and a quality product. Unfortunately it probably needs to be baffled. I have a queen bed, if you sleep single the side you are on suppresses to my weight but while the empty side of the bed inflates, causing for an uneven sleeping service. I find I have to sleep in the middle of the bed and even then movements one way or another recreate the problem. Lastly, the incline forces the mattress to slide towards the bottom of the bed, if you don't have a foot board the mattress will continue to slide until it is completely off of the Mattress Genie. Beyond that, the product does as advertised."
4,Mattress Genie Rocks,"I was skeptical about the Genie being able to lift my thick 13"" mattress, but, because of medical reasons, thought I'd give it a try. I'm sleeping like a log by lifting the head about 1"". It can lift it the full way for reading as well. I love it.It is a bit loud, but you don't need to use the pump all the time as it keeps the air pretty well. If you sleep alone on a queen bed, it does get a bit lopsided if you stay on one side, but if you move slightly to the middle, it isn't a problem."
2,Almost works well,"If you have a mattress like the memory foam ones, it holds the mattress in place, otherwise the mattress will slide. If you are one person and stay in the middle of the bed, then it will be stable, but if you try it on the side or with two people, it will wobble and be aggravating. You will positively slide down any regular bed mattress, if it is elevated at one end. You have to elevate the head and legs, to keep from sliding. That is true for even a hospital bed or one of those $5,000.00 motorized beds. Given the money, it is very appealing! Given the overall low quality and warranty, it is better to buy yourself those really large stiff square throw pillows 36x36 and put them under the mattress, for about $25.00. They lift enough to relieve my GERD problems."
3,Genie is genuine,"Received product promptly, in good shape. Mattress Genie bed lift system works fine and is easy to adjust. Recommend buying"
3,"GOOD FOR RAISING BED, BUT HAS ANNOYING QUIRKS","I need to raise the bed to hel watch tv and help with snoring, the mattress genie inflates to a triangle so forces the mattress to pull away from the head board and allows pillows to slide off. other issue is the control buttons. the up and down buttons work good, but the 3rd is a flat option to allow all the air out. that button is VERY touchy. nudge it and it causes all air to go out ... will not stop untill another button pushed."
2,Deflation,"I purchased this about 5 years ago and used it for about 4 years. It kept deflating so eventually I threw it away. When it was inflated, it was very nice, but that didn't last long."
4,Matress Genie Bed Lift,Pros: Works as stated in ads. Lifts bed all the way up to a sitting position so that you could watch TV or read. I would recommend this item to others.Cons: Too many bright lights. The controller has three buttons which are lite up like a christmas tree. Add this to the light on the pump and you don't need to turn on lights to move about the room. We have to hide or cover up the pump and controller to keed the light down.
4,Back to my bed.,I was in a scooter crash (2008 when gas went up)and the three month hospital stay exacerated my severe copd. For months during recovery I slept in a recliner. Adjustable beds are very expensive and before spending thousands of dollars I decided to try the Genie. It works just fine and I am back in my bed. May turn out to be a permanent fix but it let me know that the solution to my issues is in lifting the head of the bed. Thanks Genie for an affordable solution!
5,mattress genius,"i love this product. the air could be pumped a little faster and deflate a little faster, but overall, mattress genie is ... well, genius!"
3,gerni,"the power plug is for the states, i had to buy a power converter for another $80.00 to transfer it to 240V Australia supply"
1,Don't buy this if there are two in the bed,"This looked good on paper and the product seemed well made when it came out of the box. The problem is, on a King sized bed (and I'm sure it would apply in a Queen/Double also), both people need to be in bed or the air all goes to the ""other"" side. Also, when one person moves, it moves the other person (big time). Might work fine for a solo in a single bed, who knows?Got it today and will return it tomorrow. Glad I bought it from Amazon rather than from the company. I don't necessarily ""hate"" it, but it does not work for us."
4,great read,"I read these, the Tending Roses series. well worth my time! I loved the insights and life lessons shared and learned."
3,Very Expensive!,"This accesory is great as it allows you to play certain games wirelessly, but make sure you buy it INCLUDED with the Pokemon game. The price for buying it sepratly is almost half of the game with the wireless adapter included. So, save some money and buy this with the game!"
5,More than satisfied,"I thought this would be some joke like most other Amazon sellers I see, but two days later, I recieved my product, I was so happy! Just like the message said, my product was shipped the same exact day. I live in NY and some products that I buy right here, or in New Jersey, take about a week to get to me, but this was ridiculously fast, and I would buy from this seller again every time they have the product that I need. Oh, I forgot to mention the product! Works perfectly, thank you! That I kinda expect, because money is paid for it, but the service was phenomenal!"
2,Would have been nice a few years ago.,"The Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter from Nintendo is pretty much useless now. You can link to another Gameboy.....but all you need is a link cable. The Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter shortens your battery life severely.But the thing that gripes me the most.....there is no longer a way to use ""Mystery Gift"" in Pokemon Leaf Green/Fire Red.That is the reason I bought two of these in the first place. Oh well, live and learn. :(Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter"
1,it is one and shows two,the picture shows two and you get one. had to order a second one. not cool. should be some kind of law.
1,Total garbage,Its complete garbage1. Very small range (10 feet is pushing it)2. Very few games actually support it3. Its hugeSave your money.
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,I bought one of these for my daughter as a gift & found that I need one for each GBA or SP. So I bought another one for my son. Then after we couldn't get them to work & consulted Nintendo we found that the wireless adapter doesn't work for all multi-player games & there are only a few games that will work with the wireless version. Some gift.
5,Taos Pueblo: A Walk Through Time,This is a packed pamphlet. This is not only a map of time but also a map of the pueblo. There are a few black and white photographs and the book is divided in to tow parts one for the tour and the other for the history.Items covered in the walk though include:The MountainsThe north side puebloOutside ovens and drying racksThe KivasThe pueblo wallThe river or Pueblo CreekThe south side puebloThe mission of St. JeromeThe ruined church and cemeteryAs you can see this is useful even if you never visit but is indispensable for visitors.Taos Pueblo: Painted Stories
3,Worth having before entering the pueblo,"Although John Bodine's work makes for a fine tour of the Pueblo,there are several instances where the author is quite insultingto anyone with an open mind. After correcting some common myths,particularly about language links, he harangues the readeras though the reader would argue with his point."
5,She's So Funny,"Wow, every Judy Brown joke book gets better than the last. 'She's So Funny' is an absolute riot. Every joke is so hilarious it's hard to put down. This makes an excellent gift for male or female."
5,Funny stuff,I got it for my sister in law for Christmas- and before I wrapped it read a bunch of it out loud and my boyfriend and I were cracking up at most of the jokes. So it was worth the buy in my opinion. Some jokes were cheesy but not every joke can be a hit.
1,"Once I put it down, I couldn't pick it up again.","I'm sorry, but this book was not good. At times pedantic and rambling (yet always self-absorbed), _Girl Meets God_ is a work that will leave you wanting to meet God, too--literally."
3,"Well-written, but honestly, an Orthodox Jew?","Lauren writes beautifully and her memoir reflects much of the angst of a 20-something year old. In an interview I read with heronline in one of the Christian magazines, Lauren says that she expects most Jewish people would not be supportive or expected readers of her book. I think she's right for very good reason. To be an Orthodox Jew for a few short years (18-21? 22?) and already lapsing at the end of those few years and allow a publicity machine to maximize the ""drama"" of an Orthodox Jewish convert is indeed something some of us find shameful."
2,Distant and Disappointing,"I have to agree with John David. I was very excited to start this book, thinking of Anne Lamott and Kathleen Norris etc, but the further I read, the longer it took for me to pick the book up again, until I just stopped trying.I agree she has sections of good prose and is obviously very intelligent and well-read, but she seemed to use these talents to obfuscate the close-to-the-bone-ness one would expect from such a memoir. She definately has things worth saying, I just found myself wishing she would stop trying to impress me and just talk to me."
1,"Misnamed book, ramblings of a very confused young woman","Based on the title ""Girl Meets God,"" I was expecting this book to be the story of how an atheist or an agnostic found spirituality. It SHOULD have been called ""Jewess meets Jesus."" Basically, this young woman converts to Orthodox Judaism (her father's religion), and shortly after taking this huge step, she begins to explore the Christian religion, and eventually she REconverts to that. Basically, she doesn't know WHAT she believes in or WHAT she wants. I can't finish this book . . . but if I were to continue, I would not be at ALL surprised if she became a Muslim toward the end. In the sequel, if there is one, I predict a foray into Buddhism."
2,"tries to do two things, fails at both","On the whole, I think this book's big problem is that it's a memoir about a spiritual journey, which means it has two very different things to talk about, and both of them get short-changed because she's not a good enough writer to pull it off. The anecdotes about her life and the trajectory of her life feel scattered. She doesn't give me great faith that she could even pull off a straight memoir. Additionally, for someone who is so intellectually oriented, her discussions of religion feel very superficial."
4,good read,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself relating to her journey--perhaps not in the details, but in the struggle to find authentic faith--and I think that it would resonate with many of our generation raised by parents who were not so concerned with organized religion. She's obviously a good writer, and pretty self aware along with being obviously highly educated."
3,"Same dog coat, over and over again","The patterns are cute and very simple for a beginning to mid-level knitter attempting to move beyond scarves and hats, but there are basically 3 or 4 basic patterns reproduced with different frills over and over again. Especially true for the dog patterns - there are no sweaters, just the same coat pattern made in different gauges and with different trim. Still a nice book and I will use it, especially for baby patterns, but a few more unique styles for the 4 leggers would have been nice."
2,Not good at all,"As the previous reviewer stated, it is the same dog coat over and over and it is not even that good of a design. The same can be said for the baby clothes too. I'm glad I got it used and cheap. The toys are cute, but the rest of the book isn't good at all."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I been there for them since '93 and have watched their popularity grow and their sound get better evey year. I think just about abyone who listens to their cd, even if you have never heard of them, will enjoy their music."
4,Tutankhamun: The Last Journey,"Photographs of the tomb of Tutankhamun and of artifacts found therein accompany an account of the tomb's discovery, of the treasures within, and of the young pharaoh's life, death, and burial"
5,Potential to be HUGE,Husband and wife duo's latest release is more rock and rockabilly fueled than previous releases. Anti-war songs that are catchy and meaningful. Album flows very smoothly togetherly. For fans of the white stripes.
5,This is a great CD,"Whether you're a musician or just someone who likes listenting to good music, this CD really stands out as unique and very enjoyable. The driving rhythms of the bass playing and the overall arrangement really show off Beller's talent as a performer and writer. The compositions on this album are a very complex mix of styles that really come off well, and I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a refreshing new sound."
1,maybe my expectations were to high,"After reading Bellers articles in Bass Player over the years I was really looking forward to his debut cd. Maybe the other reviewers have a diferent copy of this cd because the one I got is atrocious. The songs themselves have potential...but Bellers choice of bass sounds,effects and tone are simply awful.You know sometimes the most important notes are the ones we don't play. Sorry, I really wanted to like this cd."
5,Wonderful guide for effective parenting,"As a mother, teacher and social worker I have had the opportunity to use Kay Hockey's advice in a variety of settings. She offers gentle, easy to follow suggestions for effective interaction with children.Parents anxious to step out of the cyclical trap of failure and discouragement will come to believe that they CAN learn new skills for raising their children after reading this book.Kay Hockey's book is a must for all parents and others who work with those in need of guidance and assistance in raising happy, healthy children."
5,Getting a new copy!!,"I used to work at an educational resource store years ago and I was able to take this home as a sample, since I had a newborn. I've had this CD for 6 years and it is now scratched and skipping! (used literally every night for six years!!) I am now on my 3rd child and each of my children listened to this for the first 2-3 years of their lives. When I tried something new, thinking maybe they'd like a change, it never worked as well! This CD is instrumental versions of well-known songs (the first is Somewhere Over the Rainbow) played over nature sounds. It is unique (we have quite the sleep CD collection for my kids at this point!!) and still my favorite! I'm glad to find it here so I can replace it! :)"
5,"Valvoline SynPower Motor Oil SAE 10W-30 - 1 Quart, Pack of 6",my car has over 176thousand miles on it runs good thought it was time to switch it to a synthice oil works great my car run better i will try the high miles oil next by valvoline max life.
2,Diappointed,"I watched this DVD after seeing and enjoying Donnie McClurkin's DVDs, Richard Smallwood and Juanita Bynum DVDs."
5,Love it,"I just posted a ""negative"" review on the Happy Trails buggy. We tried both in the store. My dog hated the Happy Trails - much too wobbly - and he LOVES this one. It's very well built, the handle is comfortably high for my 6'5"" husband. It's easy to maneuver, took it out last night on gravel and grass and had no trouble. It's very easy to push - not as heavy as it looks. The wheels are nice and big. It does collapse - requires a bit of finesse but not that difficult. Once collapsed, it locks shut and has a grip on the side to hold it. We did purchase a small bed to go inside.I absolutely recommend it.FYI: My dog is between 23-25 pounds"
4,pleased with stroller,I've had this stroller for a few weeks now and have taken it on vacation. It works very well for my dog (one leg amputated) and for me (we can both get out & I can take him with me). Draw back is the flimsy mattress/insert. I purchased a new foam back support mattress and now he is all set (degenerating discs in hislower back). Initially I had held off from getting a dog stroller because I was embarrassed to be pushing a stroller down the street with a dog in it. My experience has been otherwise & comments have been supportive. Now we are both free to roam. He loves being with his Mom as much as I enjoy his company-so we are free now to do what we please and are no longer home bound.
5,Another Fabulous Book from Carol Adrienne!!,"Carol's wisdom and insights once again inspire in this fabulous follow up to her two other books on life purpose and synchronicity. As with all her books, she offers us numerous practical exercises and steps to follow to create change in our lives. I love that she has included the advice of many experts on the various topics she covers in this work. Additionally, she profiles many unique people she has interviewed and/or taught over the years, whose life stories inspire and offer true life examples of her work and teachings. I particularly found the last two chapters helpful, on the subjects of prosperity and loss. As with her two previous books, this one is profoundly touching, inspirational and uplifting. Thanks, Carol, for once again igniting my spiritual passion and curiousity and helping me hear the wisdom of my heart and soul!!"
2,Definitely NOT recommended for the beginner,"I bougth this book and discovered that it was not for someone like me just learning Access VBA.In fact I had to buy Access 2000 VBA Handbook by Susann Novalis (ISBN 0782123244) simply this book did not cut is for me as a beginner. If you are starting out and know little or nothing about Access VBA DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Instead I recommend Novalis.With Novalis, you will learn to create forms, print to list box, sort records, create recordset, simple SQL and much more that can get you started on creating greate Access databases using VBA."
5,Where have all the Macros gone?,"After developing in Access & SQL Server for a number of years, I was always intimidated by VB development and had made a conscious effort to develop ""work-arounds"" for my lack of hard-coding skill. However, my current project required that I take-over and inherit someone else's work. Imagine my horror when I discovered that the person who built the database I had to maintain had done so almost entirely in VBA (and didn't document a single word of code). Where were all the macros? Where had my happy place gone? I begrudgingly accepted the fact that I would have to learn VBA in order to fix this database and support it. Although I'm not quite through the book, I felt like it was written specifically for guys like me. You must know your Access and your basic theory of database, but if syntax and coding experience is what you need, this book is great. I plan on getting the ""Professional"" version by Wrox as well."
3,Only two complaints,"Overall, yes it is a very good book, but I have two issues with it.1. The authors sometimes give code examples that use functions/syntax that are not explained until several chapters later. They inevitably state something to the effect 'Don't worry about such-and-such, it will be covered in chapter whatever.' In the meantime, I still can't do anything with what I'm learning.2. (and more significantly)By the author's own admission, they chose to focus on DAO rather than ADO. Maybe at the time it was written that really was the best decision, but learning DAO is a big step in the wrong direction now as ADO is already more the standard, especially as everything moves toward .NET"
4,A book for people with no programming background,"Maybe a good book for people with no programming background. For people coming from other programming languages, look elsewhere, unless you want to go through the basic concepts universal to all programming languages all over again."
4,Great Beginner Guide,"This is an easy read. I was recently charged with reporting and documentation responsibilities. I was new to VBA, but not new to programming. This book presented some pretty sound fundamentals! We have begun creating Word documents from Access instead of creating reports - I LOVE IT! - check out ""Learn Word 2000 VBA Document Automation"" for the Word details if you are interested.An Access ""must buy!"""
2,"Good Information, but where's ADO?","This is one of the books I recommend to those who want to learn about VBA and Access. I understand why they didn't choose to write their examples using ADO, but I wish they had given me a choice. If asked, I would have wanted more examples written using both data access technologies. Let me run them and decide which is slow or cumbersome. I will buy another book to teach myself ADO and I will use ADO with Access. ADO is clearly Microsoft's choice for data access in the near future (who knows what three letter acronym would be used five years from now?)."
2,ADO?,I was looking more for information regarding the development of Access 2000 front-ends for MS SQL server7. I was disappointed that the authors chose the DAO route since ADO is the default with Access data projects (.adp) Its interesting that they opted for older technology.
4,A tremendous tool to bring each day into focus,Mr. Mayeux has done a great job in give the reader practical suggestions to focus each day. The spiritual insights are both deep and refreshing.It is a must for all Christians.
5,Its a ski belt how can you go wrong!,With the hot summer this year I have been going to the lake and doing some water jogging to cool off as well as get exercise. I needed a ski belt and this just fit the bill.
4,used for snorkeling,"The belt worked fine for our trip to St. John. Was a bit stiff and not very soft like others, but did the trick and was well worth the good price. Fits great in a suitcase also."
2,"Terrible, Bootleg Copy Quality!","I searched high and low for a DVD of this movie because the soundtrack was written by one of my favorite modern composers, Max Richter. Along with his, I am a huge fan of Victorian period pieces, so I crushed to find this video was of substandard quality. The picture is grainy and the sound of the video sometimes seems out of sync with persons' lips. The only thing which keeps me from not rating this 1 Star is I still enjoyed the story very much.I will never buy from this vender again."
2,Bummer,"I purchased these shoes for my 2.5 year old, and was very disappointed that they didn't fit. Although the length is correct, I was not able to slip my son's foot in at all."
3,Nice Product,It's okay for its price. The outer material is quite stiff. I hope it will work great and last a bit long
2,Not Leather,"The description on Amazon is that they are leather, they're not. I don't know if I am going to keep them, probably not."
2,Not sure about this one,"Historically, this may be a groundbreaking publication back in its day, but I am not sure how useful it actually is for a modern understanding of logistics."
3,This Kindle edition includes only the play,"Unless it is hidden somewhere that I am unable to read, this edition is missing the following items listed in the Editorial Reviews - Product Description page:* Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play* Scene-by-scene plot summaries* A key to famous lines and phrases* An introduction to reading Shakespeare's language* An essay by an outstanding scholar providing a modern perspective on the play* Illustrations from the Folger Shakespeare Library's vast holdings of rare books"
3,"Great quotes, but not so great in between","Not my favorite Shakespeare play. Too many undeveloped characters appearing out of nowhere for my taste. On the other hand, it does have one of the most quoted monologues (All the world's a stage...)."
3,Not really about steam locomotives..........,"This book is more an overview of narrow gauge railroads in America, with a little locomotive info thrown in. Pictures are good, but I would have liked to see more focus on the trains themselves. 3 stars if you can get it cheap like I did."
5,Excellent,This is one of the best books I have ever read. The author has wonderful descriptive ability...definetly a classic.
2,Just About The Art,I picked up this graphic novel at the library. I'd read some Matt Wagner stuff before when he had done the art for a Batman story and I really liked it. That's why I checked this out. I found the reading very easy and fast going which is good because beyond the art I found little else compelling about this story. Others have liked it because it's not the glorified battle of other superheroes (which I enjoy) but I also enjoy comics that are about the story not just the art and action. I just found the whole story flat. This story centers around a man who fights evil mythical creatures with a magic bat he has. He's led around to the next evil person he needs to fight by a companion who can also fix things. There is definite potential here but I felt like the writer was telling them where to go rather than the story doing that.
2,"Fast drive, but only when it works right.",I bought my 72X Kenwood drive in January of 2000. During that time I've had a sort of love-hate relationship with it. It seems to have a lot of bugs that need to be worked out in it still. Specifically with games it has LOTS of problems. It wouldn't even work at all with Black & White until I unchecked the DMA mode option. I have had problems with a lot of other games as well. If I had to do it over again I would save myself the [price] and go with an Asus drive.
4,backlite stand,"no fuss, no muss. pleasure to do business with. arrived on time as indicated. works well. no complaints to date."
5,Photo doesn't do it justice,"Its better than it looks, not that it couldn't be customized with a latch or magnet to keep it closed. I am very happy with this purchase, stands out and is unique but hides away closed : )"
3,Cheaper Than Walgreens!,I've found limited benefit; much more impact achieved by ceasing to drink carbonated drinks out of cans - the level of carbonation/acidity in them is MUCH higher than in restaurant drinks. Also helps to cut back on ice cream.
1,"GREAT movies, LOUSY dvd","I am reviewing the dvd itself, not the 2 short films by Truffaut, which are great. You cannot watch the entire film of Antoine & Colette, because the picture freezes at 23 mins. into a 30 min. film. This is a manufacturing defect of which I informed Fox-Lorber well over a year ago. I must have purchased over ten copies from different sources at that time. All were the same on every dvd player I tried. Apparently Fox-Lorber doesn't care, because they keep re-issuing the dvd without fixing the problem. They have the same problem with their dvd release of Mrs. Dalloway. BE WARNED!!!"
5,Les Mistons: What a discovery!,"A boy bends down to smell the bicycle seat of a beautiful girl. A young woman laughs and giggles her way through a game of tennis with her lover. An elderly man sprays water at a young rascal. Forgettable yet utterly unforgettable moments are captured on film in Truffaut's enchanting short film LES MISTONS.LES MISTONS is a beautifully conceived story that seizes the attention from start to finish. Truffaut brings together the artistic endeavour and human spontaneity that characterized the best of the French Nouvelle Vague in the '50s and '60s. It is a real pleasure to watch a simple tale told so engagingly, so cinematically, a tale in which the the smallness of everyday life intersects with the vastness of human existence and emotion."
3,Missing Stats to support claims,"This book is an interesting read and I enjoy the women's stories the author chose to profile. However, I picked up this book with hopes of more key success techniques for black women hoping to attain the status of those mentioned in the book. Instead was an overwhelming reinforcment of captalism, consumerism and black women using white/western definitions of success.Chambers however did pick a unique topic that is becoming very influential in Black American culture. But with lack of statistics, surveys and data to show numbers, many of the statements were more opinions and less factual.For the sequel, I hope she emphasizes the techniques that move the women to the ""top"" and provides more numbers to give a broader view of middle class professional black women"
5,Wonderful Book!,"I must say that this bookd is long overdue. Finally a book that heralds the accomplishments of a sector of the population that has been constantly overlooked: black women. Throughout the book, the author discusses the age old question of whether it is possible to have it all. Judging by the women profiled in the book, its not only possible, but imperative! Granted some of the women felt that there was more that they could do or acquire, but a majority of them were qute settled and happy with themselves and their chosen lifestyles.The book is an easy read, something that is difficult to accomplish in some instances with nonfiction. Chambers brilliantly weaves in self help strategies with colorful and interesting anecdotes. I would definitely recommend this book to every black woman out there. It provides a lift as you read and see just how powerful and accomplished black women are and continue to be on a daily basis in a world that only grudingly acknowledges them."
1,The strange `production' company should be put on trial,"As noted by other reviewers, these films are not restored from film, but from poor video sources. The clowns in the `documentary' even admit it, if you listen carefully. The part of the commentary that I could stand was poorly prepared and repeating the obvious. Since `The Trial' is the much more interesting film of this double feature, I regret having preordered this release instead of buying the appearantly better other DVD release of `The Trial' ..."
4,easy upgrade,"I replace my OEM Audiovox speakers in my Toyota RV. I like the efficiency of these as they play loud enough to hear them with my low power radio. Installation was easy, just had to cut the original leads and splice the included leads. They mounted the same as the originals. Sound is clear, but the amp distorts at higher volume, so it is hard to know the clarity at higher volume. Price was right."
1,Not Reliable,"I purchased this punch with the anticipation that it would work as well as the older style Starrett 18AA punches that my co-workers have been using for years. I must say that I'm thoroughly disappointed. It simply doesn't punch consistently. I'm lucky to get it to punch twice in a row without jiggling the tip or taking it apart. It doesn't reload itself to punch, which is unacceptable when I'm trying to punch several times in a row to prep a panel for drilling. While it may be a defective unit, I have my doubts because it's design is the same as the cheap box store one I replaced it with that has the exact same problem.All in all, the design has changed from what seemed to be a reliable quality tool to one that is inconsistent at best."
2,"""Do You Guys Smell That?!""...","MUTANT MAN is about an RV full of cannibal prey who break down in the middle of nowhere. Luckily, an anthropophagic hillbilly family offers them a place to spend the night. Our heroes are unaware that these are no ordinary hicks. They have a torture chamber in the basement! And a 7' mutant brother w/ hideously foul dental hygiene! He also growls and wears my mother's old 70s wig! Most of the victims are so annoying that it's a relief when they become mutant-chow! MM is your basic slaughter-fest w/ typically crazy inbreds carvin' up the tourists (Think WRONG TURN meets MOTHER'S DAY). There's blood, nudity, Ed Wood-style ""acting"", and excruciating attempts at humor. Still, I actually stayed awake 'til the end! I dare you to do the same..."
1,I've seen over 200 slashers & this is one of the 2 worst,"In 1959, two kids watch their mom die give birth to a demonic baby in this dreadful slasher film from Suzanne DeLaurentiis, who made her name performing in cheesy '80s T&A movies. Forty years later, a group of young numbskulls go camping and break down near the remote farm where it happened, only to be set upon by the now-grown Mutant Man and his sick protectors. There's bad music, bad acting, bad effects, and some of the most moronic dialogue this side of Bats. The Mutant Man himself is big Jim Baldi in Morlock makeup and a silly blond wig. He runs around the woods growling and beating people in the head when he isn't chaining young women in root-cellars. As far as slasher movies go, it's not as bad as The Last Slumber Party, but it comes very close and is just as big a waste of time."
2,Cheesay,I would say this is a pretty bad movie. It was not scary. There were some digusting parts but they were cheesy. I would not recomend purchasing nor renting this film. Chopping Mall is a masterpiece compared to this piece of material.
3,Typos problems,The e-book was seriously flawed. There were typos too numerous to count. This led to a disjointed and annoying reading experience. However if you could get beyond that the fictionalized historical content of the American Revolution was interesting. Not the most scholarly writing but an interesting account of the resistance movement especially women's role.
2,Can you say RUN-ON sentence? I KNEW YOU COULD!,"I don't care if a story is good...if it isn't written well, it doesn't deserve to be published! This is the worst editing and typesetting I have seen in my entire life (and I used to teach elementary school). There are about 10 run-on sentences in the foreward alone. Granted, I am no grammatical genius myself, but consider also the fact that the author reprinted this book (plenty of time to fix the errors)and took a long time to do it. I am sure the story is fantastic, or it wouldn't sell as well as it has. ""ROY GRAHAM,"" take it from an avid reader...we don't like to work hard to get through a fun book. Please try again!"
2,Great Story - horrible writing!,"If you can ignore the grammatical blunders and repetition throughout the book, you will enjoy the story. My spouse, having met the horse trainer through the cattle business, couldn't put the book down. Personally, it took me several tries to complete the book -- to the point I finally ""forced"" myself to complete the reading. The amateurish writing was very distracting. Don't fool yourself into thinking it will get better. It won't. I hope the movie is better."
1,Incredibly idiotic,"This book could have been shorter by leaving out the word 'I.' Totally unedited and gramatically terrible. Also Graham starts off describing his own flying experience in a T-41, the predecessor to the F-16.Ha! It's a single engine Cessna, predecessor to the Cessna 172. To believe that ""muscles"" could be the brains behind the largest marijuana smuggling operation in Texas, certainly not his multi-millionaire boss is ridiculous.This is a book about a crooked man and a pilot with little knowledge of what's going on under his nose"
2,Poorly Written,"I remember this story well from the late 70's and early 80's and this book has some interesting information. However, it is obvious the book was written by someone whose talents do not include writing books. It is full of gross grammatical errors, misspellings, and a general lack of knowledge of our criminal justice system. And to make matters worse, Mr. Graham continually repeats himself. If these small details do not detract from your reading pleasure, the book is a quick, decent read."
2,Too many reviews,Reading all the reviews on this book (Cowboy Mafia) was like reading a book in itself. Most books of this genre garner only half a dozen reviews at best whereas this one has 34 at last count. Several of the 34 reviews are repeated bringing the actual total down to about 20-25 reviews but in my opinion many of them are bogus. Sorry Roy Graham. I do not believe all of your reviews and I believe even less in the favorable reviews supposedly written by large publications. Amazon.com you should confirm at least some of the reviews written about your products before your rating system loses all its credibility.
2,Childish,"Roy appears to have a story to tell but it is very hard to find given the multitude of problems here. Apparently this book was written, edited, and published without the benefit of professionals. I can only hope that Roy doesn't truly have the literacy of a second grader as this book seems to indicate. I would lose a lot of respect for pilots if this is the case. I suspect a mental defective would have better luck publishing a book without having paragraphs end in mid-sentence and then begin a new paragraph like nothing happened and without the benefit of punctuation. All the while butchering the grammar and spelling of words and sentences like: ""See Spot run"". I suspect it isn't easy to find new ways to misspell words every sentence."
2,Cowboy Mafia,"What a shame that such an intriguing true story should be so poorly written. Not only do we have to wade through poor grammar and sentence structure, but rambling sequences and repetition. The story could have been a real page turner if the airplane pilot who wrote it had received advice from someone who could complete a sentence and spin a yarn."
1,Cowboy Mafia,"..Book is of interesting subject...however, author is so repetitive that, if he was any kind of writer at all, the information that he gave would have filled less than 50 pages. WS"
3,Cowboy Mafia,Interesting story albeit one sided. Would like to read the other side of this tale to get a balanced view of events. Entertaining read but why didn't anyone proof read it for punctuation errors the spelling? How hard could that have been? I could have proof read it when I was in junior high school and caught all the errors.
2,Disapointing,"The subject would be interesting but Roy Graham is neither a journalist who presents facts in a well-rounded manner nor a good writer. This book was obviously self-published and the author chose to ignore the obvious need to proof-read and edit his copy. The fact that he called a T-41 a jet in the first three pages was also a tip-off that he either didn't proof the copy for mistakes or wanted the reader to think more highly of his flying prowess. I think he was referring in this instance to the U.S. Air Force's basic jet trainer, the T-37 which in no way resembles an F-16 fighter. The T-41 is a 145 horsepower version of the Cessna 172 single engine piston powered aircraft. I also do not think the Air Force used outside contractor training in the T-37 jet trainers. My final disappointment was the author's obvious bias in favor of these drug smugglers. In my opinion, big or small fish, drug smugglers are all lowlifes."
5,Innovators,"These tracks were the original fusion of Hip-hop and R&B andstill have tons of flava. After BBD showed the way with these jams, soul singers like Mary J. Blige and R.Kelley started to lay down vocals over hip-hop tracks and everyone else followed(and still follows to this day).DJ Finesse"
1,Whatever ???,"You gotta be kidding !! The Best Of Bell Biv Devoe, is a joke, right ?? After 2 CDs on MCA (the recent CD from last year shipped plastic!!!!), they have enough material for a BBD compilation.BBD wasn't a 'legendary' group, like New Edition, so this CD should be given away to customers.DO NOT PAY for this or any BBD CD!! Most of these dated 80's songs can be found on 'Poison' & thier followup CDs can also be found in cut out bargain bins of most stores!!...These Millenium CDs from Universal really make me believe that someone is on 'the pipe' over there, and with all of these countless New Edition-Related compilations & anthologies being released, you'd probably agree with me.My Verdict-This CD is a waste of retail space!!"

3,Cleverly disguised commentary on current events,"While subtitled as a novel of the crusades it is actually a very cleverly disguised treatise on current events; the battle of religions for control of the middle east and the world at large, how each religion that was spawned in the middle east believes in the same god but differs in the means, how politics, vanity greed and fear are used to promote wars, control a people and to gain wealth. Around this were a interwoven a sometimes clever murder mystery and the common hopes and fears of men and women in battle. The writing while tedious too often to merit my wanting to read more of his work did keep a constant style and voice. The characters ring true with surefooted research into the history of the crusades, the depths of emotions felt and expressed differently by men of war, religion, and honor and woman who love them and express their opinions in carefully chosen responses. A good read."
1,This book was a BIG disappointment!,"I loved the first book in the series. And I'm a nut for anything with knights, especially The Knights Templar. But this book fails miserably when it comes to character development and action.It's almost as if the book was written in a rush."
1,How Can Such Great Authors Read So Badly?,"a collection of shockingly mediocre excerpts from excellent authors. the compiler failed even to pick the best scenes from the books represented, much less from other titles by the authors themselves or their contemporaries. and the intros to each excerpt are invariably valueless."
1,Will not fit a 1991 dodge ram D250,This is a universal part. It actually gives you a package of washers and a printed list and makes you install the one you need by smashing it in with a punch and hammer. Says it will fit a Dodge Ram D250 5.9l but it don't. It usesStandard Motor Products EGR Valve. Now i'm out 3.99 plus return shipping.
3,Good but not professional.,"The book is helpful for someone with no Spanish vocabulary at all. It explains how to pronounce the Spanish words and phrases, but it's targeted to those who need restaurant and 'some' kitchen translations at an intermediate level.I imagined it as a dictionary, but instead, it classifies the terms and phrases by category, for eg. Equipment, Actions, etc. and inside each category, there is no alphabetical order.There are many words repeated since one word fits several categories.Many words can be found in any English to Spanish dictionary."
4,A great resource,"I'm a training representative for Hispanic employees in a major restaurant chain. This book has been an incredible aid to increased communication between management and staff. I appreciate that it uses real restaurant lingo, and the translations are pretty good.My only concern is the fact that all verbs are presented in the familiar ""tu"" form. In certain cases such a familar address could be seen as offensive."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was really hoping that this book would help me, but it's just not doing the job. It's so complicated and the stuff I need isn't in there. The kitchen is a really fast paced place to be in and this book is good if you can sit down and study it but in the kitchen, it's a waste. That's what it is to me, a total waste of money."
1,Look to another Label for this Work.,The Orchestre de la Societe du Conservatoire is inadequate for serious listeners and music lovers. Neither Andre Cluytens (the conductor) nor Aldo Ciccolini (the pianist) is at his best and they are frequently not together in this performance. The Testament Label ADD recording is technically inferior ~ and not just because the original recording dates to a 1953 performance. I would recommend the Montreal Symphony / Thibideaux recording for anyone interested in adding this work to his music collection.
5,Picture Perfect,"If one can't manage to complete a book in a week, then it is not a book. It is a reference that you occasionally use. XML, Web Services, and the Data Revolution by Frank P. Coyle definitely comes under my 'book' category. If one wants to learn what XML and Web Services are in a week, this is a book to read.Lot of information yet concise presentation accomplished with self explanatory pictures depicting various XML technologies."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, SHIPPED SUPPER FAST AND CAME AS DESCRIBED. FOR WHAT I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THING WORKS WONDERS AND I AM VERY SATISFIED!!!!!!!!"
5,Great for duracoat,"I purchased this airbrush to apply a product called duracoat to my firearms. It's a polymer/acrylic type coating that prevents rust and helps protect the firearm.Other than being a little thick and in need of some thinning, I was able to apply it with the stock #3 brush without issue.I used my Bostich show air-compressor and dialed the regulator down to 40 lbs and it ran perfectly.I had no over-spray or other issues and the evenness of the coat was amazing. The brush feels solid in your hands and works great for spraying on lots of paint."
3,If you like it mellow this is for you...,Not my cup of tea but it is very mellow and has some nice basslines mixed with smoothe vocals. If I had to pick a favorite it would have to be number 7.
1,Mach 1.5 (Wallpaper),"Its very subjective. As a web designer, I find the music like backgrd loops in a shockwave movie. If u are not into funk or hip tunes, try avoid it."
5,5 stars for the Patriotism....3 stars on the tracks,"I applaud their continued patriotism, but for the most part the music bores me, just a little...a good band, just repetitive for the most part, not alot of variety. I'd recomend the Fozzy All That Remains, Reloaded CD for an amazing CD.All That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)"
3,Not too bad but they are so much better than this....,"I loved the first two albums. The Better Life was mostly straightforward and honest rock (although I understand that some music elitists who think that the only good music out there is stuff they listen to didn't like it because influences like Alice in Chains are easily heard). Away From The Sun did have a more produced sound but it was still amazing and although I liked the first album more this one was still amazing and in some ways the guitars were better. I gave this album a few listens and to be honest the only songs I liked were ""Landing in London"" and ""Be Somebody"" along with ""It's Not Me"". It almost seems that the band is not trying as hard anymore, too many of the themes heard on the first two albums are repeated here and the guitars aren't nearly as heavy or as fun to listen to. I like the band too much to totally diss them and give them a one, but I hope they go back to rock and roll riffs instead of poppish-sounding ones."
3,Everyone's right,"With this CD I can see the point of view of the lovers and the haters. Seventeen Days isn't nearly as hard as their first CD and they seem to have sacrificed some of their creativity to write ""hits"". The whole CD has an overproduced, radio-friendly feel which I don't think the first CD did. However, some of the riffs and melodies are so damn catchy you still find yourself singing along and grooving to the music. I really like the road ballad ""Landing in London"" and the faster paced ""Right Where I Belong"", ""Never Will I Break"" and ""Father's Son""."
5,Great Come back,"3 doors down's latest LP ""Seventeen days"" is their best LP, not because is their latest effort but because all the songs can be hits. They released their 1st single ""Let me go"", then the radio hits, Behind those eyes, Here by me, Live for Today, and the latest collaboration with Bob Seger ""Landing in London"".Unfortunately ""Seventeen days"" hadn't recieved the expected success in US and worldwide. I still hope that with one of their upcoming singles they will achieve the success they failed to reach with their previous singles.I rate all the songs so you can see my opinion for this LP1. Right where I belong 9/102. It's not me 9/103. Let me go 10/104. Be somebody 9/105. Landing in London 10/106. The real life 10/107. Behind those eyes 9,5/108. Never will I break 8,5/109. Father's Son 10/1010.Live for today 8/1011.My world 9/1012.Here by me 9/10I really want to see in the furure a video for ""The Real life""Personally this song is my favorite on this LP."
1,You Know Better,"You're smart enough to make the choice, 12 songs that sound the same and copy every riff of the precedent, or 1 song which will change your life, your existence and your consciousness?Get _Meshuggah's I_ now."
1,i'm disappointed,"this cd didn't live up to the last two at all. I like 3 doors down alot, but this cd was disappointment."
2,2 Stars For 3 Doors,"I really tried to like 3 Doors Down's latest but I find myself wanting to skip to the next track everytime I give the album another listen. It's not ""bad""; the guys can obviously play their instruments and play them well, it's just that it feels like it lacks something; maybe the catchy and memorable choruses found on ""Away From the Sun"" and ""the Better Life"". If you are a huge fan of the band, add ""Seventeen Days"" to your collection, otherwise I wouldn't bother."
4,Seventeen Days,"Really good CD...I had a hard time taking it out of my CD player after the first play-through. Sure beats the he** out of some of the crap that has been churned out in recent years (think Lindsay Lohan, Ashlee Simpson)."
5,"""Right Where They Belong"" at #1","Seventeen Days is just one more successful attempt at musical genius by 3DD. I definitely find that when i listen to this CD the band has definitely become stonger not only musically but also vocally, Brad's voice has definitely taken on a different stronger vibe. Some of my favorites off of this CD are Behind those eyes, which takes on that southern rock feel, it's not me, be somebody and Landing in London with Bob Seger is just amazing. But that's not to say i don't like the others. All of 3DD's CD's you like from beginning to end and this one isn't any different. I'd definitely recommend Seventeen Days to anyone who likes good music!"
4,From the UK,"Being from the dance obssed uk and 'kylie' it's refreshing to hear good american rock 'sugar coated' the twats who dish this are back home waiting for the next real thing...whatever that is, this is nice melodic crap you can sing to on a summers afternoon unoffensive. A good buy"
3,17 Days/average at best and not enough rock to roll!,"Descent release, but lacks needed energy to be great! The 1st three tracks kick it into high gear which makes the album very inviting. Unfortunately,the effort soon lame ducks into more tendered offerings which take up the majority here? Their needs to be a higher count of rockers vs. ballads INMOP.!The softer tracks are descent, but not overly interesting enough! The boys from MISSISIP kinda of slipped & skipped on this one!17 Days/average at best and not enough rock to roll!"
3,Not My Favorite Album From The Band,"This album starts off rocking hard, then it starts to fizzle towards the middle of the album, but I do like the song ""Here By Me"". I think one of the ""biggest"" songs on the album is supposed to be ""Landing in London"" with Bob Seger, but it just ends up being a little dull and disappointing. It does, however, have the big sound of a Seger song. It may sound bad, but there are some good songs on here to be found. ""Let Me Go"" is great and one of my favorite 3DD songs and ""Behind Those Eyes"" and ""Never Will I Break"" are other awesome songs. Overall, a pretty good album, but what do you expect when this was put together in about 17 days (which is why the album is named so)."
2,"Change, when it comes to 3 Doors Down, is not good.","3 Doors Down was my favorite band. (""Was"" being the key word.) I LOVED Away From the Sun-it had good lyrics, good music, and each song had a strong beat. But when I heard the songs on this CD, I was extremely disappointed in this band. ""Never Will I Go"", ""Here by Me"", and ""Let Me Go"" were the only songs I enjoyed. I hope their next CD will be like their old CD."
2,hmmmm,I loved their first CD. But listening to each song on this cd is like a another hook being cast into your brain. This is a pathetic atempt to make good music. To find I can not even listen to most of these songs on this cd comes to a shock to me because I can listen to almost any music. Its like they're trying to write commercial songs but even then the song are not ear candy. Its a effort to listen to this CD and a waste of my money.
4,Not bad but they could have done better,"This album is deffinatly listenable, but I liked Away from the Sun a lot more. It had so many great songs and I was expecting this one to be the same. Tracks 2 and 3 are really good in my opinion and I also like 10 and 12. The rest are decent but are kind of repetitive and get old after a while. If you don't have any 3 doors down cd's go and buy Away from the Sun... it's a great album, but don't have too high expectations if you're planning on getting this one. I hope it doesn't take them too long to come out with a new, better cd, because i love 3 doors down at their best."
3,GOOD but NOT GREAT,"After their dissapointing Away From The Sun, I though theres no hope for this band but this cd actually aint half bad. Its easy to listen to so i wouldnt call it hard rock, its just good ol fashioned rock n roll. After hearing the first track, Right Where I belong i was lead to believe that the rest of the album was going to be just as fast and heavy, BOY was i mistaken. The album after that is soft but theres some good songs : Landing In London, Fathers Son, Never will i break. This style is ok but gets tiresome and I just want to see 3dd return to the sound employed on their first album: The Better Life (instead of a radio friendly approach for the masses which is what theve unfortunately taken)...oh well maybe next time."
3,3 album a bummer,"I seriously loved Better Life and Away from the Sun. In 17 days they return to the harder rock like the 1st album (which they should have released so many more songs from... Down Poison, So I need you??) but its a lot slower and I think the INfluence of Nickelback wasn't for the better. One problem with nickelback is that all their songs sound the same. In away from the sun this was prevalent but was easy to ignore. In 17 days its just like Silver side up in the fact that they all blend together (with a few exceptions of course). Being a fan of them from the beginning (from Mississippi) I still bought their album, but the mixer who has mixed all the NU metal, umm I'd get a different one. I recommend the Live EP 700 miles instead"
3,A bit disapointing,3 Doors Down is one of my favorite bands. Their first album a Better life is song for song the best album I have ever heard. Away from the Sun was toned down a bit and now 17 days to me is about the same as away from the Sun. No really heavy riffs that A better life had. Its not really a rocking album. Its not bad but not great. You can tell they wrote these songs in 17 days. If you like 3 doors down you will enjoy this album. Enjoy it not Love it that is. If you liked here without you you will like the song Landing in London.
3,"Good acustic additions, but copyrighted","I enjoy the acoustic additions to this disc. Even without them, Seventeen Days is 3 Doors Down best cd. However, unlike the non-dual disc, this cd is copyright protected. Since I was unaware of this when I bought it, and Amazon does not mark it as such I thought you needed to be informed. This means that while it will most still play in (most) cd players, it cannot be played on the computer, thus it can not be put on an ipod or mp3 player! While I do not blame 3 Doors Down, I do have anger towards the record companies and thought others should be aware of this before buying this cd.edit:Apparently this cd may not be copyrighted according to one reviewer. However, I did try the cd on 4 different computers and went to a computer genius for help. On all computers the dvd side worked and the cd side did not. So I guess try your own luck!"
4,Great Cd For Rock music lovers,"I first heard of them when i herad the song ""Kryptonite"" which i am sure everyone has heard. I liked that song right away. This is a great album. My favorite tracks are Let Me Go, Be Somebody, Right Where I belong, and The Real Life. Give those tracks a listen and you will like this CD too."
3,"It's 3 Doors Down, just tuned down a notch...","3 Doors Down is a terrific band with much talent within. I am a big fan of the first cd, 'The Better Life' and their second CD, 'Away From the Sun', but the third, I'm just not into as much. The thing about 3 Doors Down that I always enjoyed in the previous two CDs was that they brought on elegance when writing the slower-paced songs, but in this latest installment from the gang, the elegance they once had has been unfortunately withered away. I have listened to Seventeen Days many times within the last week, and I get bored with the constant slow-esq pace of how the album goes. I feel like most of the songs were forced, maybe more personal, but in the long run, I was hoping for more of a sound that was mixed between fast songs and slow songs, rather than mostly being dominated by slow songs. I gave it 3 stars because I thought it was a valiant effort, and I'm looking forward to hearing more from this band in the future!"
2,Same Old Stuff That Everyone Does Now,"I will admit that 3 Doors Down is more talented than the other power chord wonders out there that do alternative and punk music that they now call rock. At least the lead vocal can sing which I can say is nice compared to the others who sound like wounded dogs. If you want real good rock you need to go back before the 90's, even the late 70's when there were a lot more complex arrangements, compositions and even better lyrics that actually said something instead all this silly adolescent angst.What happened to musicianship and creativity? The record industry just want formulas to make a quick buck, forget true music as an art form. It really shows what they think of our young people who waste their money on this stuff, stupid is as stupid buys."
2,17 days? More like 15 minutes..,"Don't get me wrong. I'm not a 3DD hater. I liked that song ""Kryptonite"" when it hit #1 on rock radio in 2000. But this CD? This CD is completely boring and unoriginal. It sounds like the band abandoned their ""mainstream rock"" style for an ""adult contempory"" style. They try to sound ""softer"" and more ""middle of the road"", hoping it will put them on top of the charts again. Just one problem...the songs are BORING!They all have a dull, droning sound. The lyrics are in the same monotone voice throughout the entire CD. They use the same distortion on every song. Its very boring to hear.I can't recommend this CD to anybody. Stick to the first CD if you like the 3DD songs you hear on the radio. This is the worst 3DD CD yet."
3,Just OK,"This is Three Doors down's newest album, and I have to say, I'm a little diappointed. The songs aren't their best, except maybe ""Let Me Go"". To me it's much slower than their previous albums and not as good. If you really want it go buy it, but if you are tight on cash I'd probably pass on buying this album at least until it becomes cheaper or borrow it from someone else before making the decision to purchase it (though it is really cheap at Target!!) Hope I helped"
1,This is just awful...,"Sorry to be so negative, but I really hate this album. I'm not a 3 Doors Down ""hater"", because I actually bought this cd when it came out expecting it to be good, but it was a TOTAL dissapointment! All the songs on this cd are a complete waste of time and not worth listening to. THey all sound the same and lack creativity. The song structures are very predictable and boring, nothing sounds original or different from all the other middle of the road Top 40 radio rock bands. Nothing about this cd is original enough to hold your attention, it just rings hollow. Completely unoriginal and boring, not even one good song! BOOOOOOOO!"
3,Spears break easily,"We bought these as a Christmas gitt for our 6-year old son. The riders come off the horses easily and stand on their own. Helmets do not come off. After 2 months of jousting many times per day, both swords have broken off close to the handle. Not really surprised given how they were handled. Could be fixed with tape, I guess."
3,KEITH EMERSON SOLO PROJECT,I REALLY DIDNT LIKE THIS ONE. I RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE A KEITH EMERSON FAN THAT YOU GIVE EMERSON PLAYS EMERSON A LISTEN . HIS KEYBOARD PLAYING IS MY FAVORITE THROUGHOUT MY ROCK AND ROLL PAST AND FUTURE. I JUST WISH ELP WOULD CONSIDER DOING IT ONE MORE TIME.
1,Avoid this recording,"After reading Marks 5 star rating, I trusted this must be a great recording to have. I was sorely mistaken. This is the most abstract, useless music I have ever heard (next to rap music). If this is to give some impression of Emersons talents, it will drive you away.Stick to buying Rick Wakeman, Jordan Rudess, and only ELP albums to enjoy Keiths limited talent.Anyone want a free CD, you can have my copy for free."
2,"Truly not worth it, unless for a casual player","This book is truly not useful to anyone save the casual AC player (is there such a kind?!). A simple internet search would reveal many more useful websites with free, up-to-date info, such as Maggie the Jackcat, AC Strata, etc."
2,Only worthwhile if you are brand new to Dereth,"It has some decent information on getting a player prepared for the world they are about to enter, but as stated in other reviews, there are many websites where one can obtain much more accurate and up-to-date information. The main reason for this is the monthly updates. In each patch new content is added and sometimes old content is changed. If you are already playing, do not bother to buy the book. If you are just starting out, it may help you a little, but it still may not be worth the price."
3,A great look back...,"If you're an old AC player looking to remember the ""good ol' days"", this guide might have something for you. However, all of the information is outdated, and there are websites and forums that have more currently information for Asheron's Call players.I would point out that this guide suffers from the same curse that plagues all print guides for MMOs: they're obsolete as soon as they go to print. All MMOs are constantly changing, and as such the information in a print guide is outdated in a very short amount of time."
1,Dont Buy,"It has maybe 5 total pages of Dark Majesty info. Lots of regular information if your just starting the game, but you could find better, more up to date information on websites."
4,"A Good ""Regency Romance"" Set in Old England","This is a saucy romance novel: She was a penniless ward, yearing for love...he was the wealthy master of Oakhaven. Beautiful Claire Amberly trembled at the sight of the handsome rake who had suddenly become her guardian. Lord Ross had come to this newly acquired estate to take full possession of his title, his fortune, and the fate of the lovely orpan who had been his brother's ward. Their first meeting exploded into unexpected passion and Claire knew the proud Lord Ross had also taken possession of her heart. But she had been warned never to expect an offer of marriage from the wealthy master of Oakhaven. He was betrothed to a sophisticated Regency heiress, and if Claire hoped to win him for herself, she would have to learn the rules of the dangerous game of romance played among the haughty London aristocats. Enjoy!"
5,Le Creuset Mini Cocotte,This miniature pot is decorative as well as utilitarian since it can be used on the flame for melting butter or small amounts of sauces.
4,Jayne Kennedy's best film.,"This is rather a slight film, but the presence of Jayne Kennedy, the most beautiful woman to ever walk the earth, makes it worth seeing. I saw it when it originally aired and never forgot it. Another old favorite, Clint Walker, does what he can with the meager script."
1,Mysterious Island of Beautiful Women,The Cover has Clint Walker listed first as the star. He was not the star and he had only a small part. I was really disgusted. I wasted my money.
1,Classics: Bible songs,"I was very disappointed in purchasing this tape for my nephew. It was Classics: Bible songs. My nephew is autistic and cannot talk but loves music. I thought this may help him speak while listening in the car. Instead I received a tape that was destroyed thru the mail. I wrote the people who sent it to me and they told me that it was not their fault to write Amazon.com which I did and have not heard one word from them.Very disappointed with the service of both partiesthe reason I gave it one start was because I HAD to rate it or this would not go thru, otherwise it would be a big ZERO"
5,its the truth,"i went by the cologne store and sprayed this good stuff on me and it fit like a glove. i always enjoy smelling good and this is the truth. real clean,clear and smooth."
4,Plasmacars,"Bought two plasmacars for my grandkids. Easy to put together. The kids are 2 yrs. old. The cars are a little old for them, but they still enjoyed pushing them & being pushed on them. And will grow into them. Exactly what I expected them to be."
3,plasma car,"I bought a plasma car for each of my boys, (ages 6 and 4). They enjoyed them for about an hour. I really thought they would be easier to propel than they are. If you are on any bit of incline it is almost impossible to make the car go without using your feet on the ground. It is fun to find a small hill and coast down, but coming back up is a pain. I have even tried to find really flat pavement and still you are at times practically not moving."
5,"""Just like driving my own car!"" said my son.","We'd been looking for a green plasmacar everywhere and finally found it here on Amazon. The price here was cheaper too. My son played with one at his cousin's house and really wanted a green one (his favorite color). Imagine his surprise when he got it for his birthday. He loves it and finds reasons to hop on every chance he gets. Even now, a year later, that he also has a bike and a scooter he still races around on his plasmacar from time to time."
2,I hope we end up liking this more,"I am a bit sad. The kids were trying to ride this on a flat new side walk. It wasn't up hill or anything, but they didn't seem to be able to get it going very well. I hope we have better luck tomorrow."
4,Toy is great just wrong color.,I ordered this car in lime green and was sent this dark teal color. My order also was shipped to another state and I had to track it and luckily it arrived in time for Christmas. All my grandchildren have these original Plasmacars and they have hours of fun with them. Only buy the original though.
5,"The one and only , Celia!","I watched Victor Manuelle on TV singing that song at her funeral and it was so appropiate, her life was a carnival, she was always happy and this album and that song are the personification of Celia Cruz. It is a must have CD!"
5,grande raccolta di canzoni,"ottima raccolta di brani famosi di celia cruz, veramente un bel cd consigliato a quanti si avvicinano alla musica latino americana"
5,amazing!!!,Juan Gonzalez is a true master!!! Just an amazing book!! The research that was done making this book is mindboggling. THANK YOU JUAN!!!!
1,"Too biased, unprofessional","I had to read this book for a class in college, and found it to be downright difficult to read at times. While my professor saw it as just an alternative viewpoint, it really was just biased against anything ""anglo"", and blames ""anglos"" for every problem in Latin American countries, past and present. He uses emotional language quite a bit in the book, rather than giving neutral facts (i.e. ""Their rejection enraged Roosevelt, who was not about to permit some petty feud among inferior Latin Americans to stop the greatest engineering project in U.S. history""). This is not a history text, but the diatribe of an angry old man about real events."
4,It is cool..,I have to read this book because of my class. However I really enjoyed to read this book. It was pretty interesting and making me to think about Latinos.
3,Decent Read for young students,"The book is well written and if a student would enjoy reading a book containing many of lifes issues regarding child abuse, poverty, rascism, plus more. It takes one young boy to try and correct a lot of issues that go bad in his town. Excellent summer read for students middle to HS."
2,This is really not a good book,It's a collection of transcriptions of conversations/debates on various subjects between Derrida and other scholars. Sometimes I laughed out loud at the ridiculous statements and non-sequiturs.
4,good movie with math,"I admit I only bought this because it was mentioned in a book ""Math goes to the Movies"" (bought on amazon.com). It is a well-acted romantic comedy with a proof of the ""Snake Lemma"" (well, the main part of the proof). The mathematics is correct, I think the story/plot holds together, and the actors are engaging, especially the stars Jill Clayburgh and Michael Douglas."
3,OK product but extremely wasteful and expensive shipping,"I was really just looking for real exhaust rated hi-temp gasket material which this for the most part works but isn't exactly what I was looking for. My main quarrel with this particular product on Amazon is how over-packaged this item is. It came in a box nearly 2x longer 1.5x wider and tall enough to pack 100 of these when it should have just came in a simple stiff envelope or something. I thought the shipping was drastically overpriced for a 2d item and now I know why.In this day in age, I think most people know the price of shipping isn't attached to the actual cost of shipping an item but in this case the seller feels inclined to spend every dime of the shipping charges on the box, stuffing and shipping charges which is extremely wasteful.As for the item, I would only use this for tail-pipe applications. This isn't for turbo or header gasket materials which is what I needed it for."
2,Daisy Powerline 693,This product was not what I expected. I have not bought the CO2 for it yet but I can tell already that I will not like it. It feels nothing like a real weapon which will not give me the results that I want for my training.
1,Had problems with the Daisy 622x,"I had to toss my Daisy 622x, a model similar to this one. The clip never rotated properly so most of the time shot just air unless I lined up the pellet manually. Also the gun stopped holding air so all Co2 would escape when I tightened the puncture screw ie something wrong with the seal. Overall not happy with Daisy quality. It looks like they discontinued the 622x but wanted to warn those considering a Daisy about the potential for poor design and or build quality."
5,"Great gun, misleading sale pictures.","The weapon was everything I wanted. The only problem is the online pics made the buyer think they were getting everything else but the case and the holster. Naturally, I would have purchased cartridges and mags otherwise...Feel cheated! Do not display things that are not part of the sale."
4,Pistol,"I like the product, but be sure when you do order it order some cartridges because it does not tell you that it comes with one.."
4,Great Gun Few Downsides.,This gun is great. But it is kind of weak only good for target shooting. Also another downside is that this gun burns through Co2 cartiages.
2,There are better,"I've had this pistol for about 5 years now and have used it for everything from plinking to pest control and survival hunting. That being said, the power is great on this thing but the accuracy is AWEFUL. The trigger mechanism is way too long and when the hammer hits the gas release, the gun automatically twitches right (or which ever way is your dominant hand). The sights are also impossible the use unless you paint on some color to the front one. For the price they're charging on here (they sell these at walmart for $25 btw) you can do way better."
4,"reliable fun, light weight","not as powerful as the 15xt but more accurate. i had a lot of fun with this before i gave it away. for me, the trigger had just the right amount of tension for those days when i needed to blow off steam in the the backyard. i could empty the clip almost as fast as i could change clips. great for target practice and clowning around."
4,Very Good Gun,"This gun is very good. It is very accurate at 30 feet. Once you put a new CO2 in, it has a little kick. After a couple of shots it loses power. It feels good to hold. It can be used at close range with a new powerful CO2. It can kill a mouse or a rat. The trigger feels good. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is annoying to load the bb's in the cartridge. They have to loaded 1 at a time. It holds 15 in one cartridge I think. I took away 1 star because of the loading. Buy more BB cartridges so after you shot all 15 shots you can put a new cartridge in it that is full loaded."
1,just dont buy!!!!!!,"waste of money, u can get this much cheaper from walmart!better to spend ur money in something else...cheaterssss:@"
5,"""Blue Stickers"" is a hit at our house","These die cast cars are hands down my son's favorite toys, and this Dinoco McQueen has become his favorite. Fast shipping, a smooth transaction, and a great price mean I will look hear first for other future best friends!!"
1,Kingtinued,The other reviews said he sounded just like Elvis well he tryed so hard to sound like Elvis that he left out the feeling Elvis put into his music which is what made Elvis Elvis.
1,Uh-Oh,"When I first saw Kingtinued, I thought that it was an unfunny joke. Now that I know differently, it's the worst thing I've ever heard."
4,Elvis Now Rocks Germany,"Elvis Now is big news, and with good reason--Backed by an ace band that includes some of the biggest talents in the industry, Elvis Now has asserted itself as the preeminent Elvis tribute album.Reminding the world that Elvis may be dead but the memory of what could have been lives on.This two-disc, 25-track collector cd may be the strongest piece of music to be released since Elvis's death.the jaw-dropping tunes of ""Graceland"", ""La Vida Loca"" and ""Tears in Heaven"", carry this piece into the stratosphere. Worth twice the price. --Hans Deiter Koppel"
5,The best Elvis-impersonator of all times,"I've got the Kingtinued CD a few weeks ago, but I'm still surprised every time I'm listening to it, that Doug could sound like Elvis. His voice is so close to Elvis' voice, that sometimes it's hard to believe, that it's not Elvis himself. It's just great to hear Doug singing! The CD Kingtinued is a must for every real Elvis-fan!I especially love his interpretation of Elton John's ""Candle in the wind"" and a lot of other songs on this two CD's. It would be wonderful, if he decided to record ""Walking in Memphis""."
4,Elvis singing today's hits?,"This highly polished, produced and presented 2-CD offering has a great 25 track listing. More so, vocalist, Doug Church captures the Elvis nuance on most tracks. What's most unusual, is that Doug (unlike most Elvis impersonators I've heard) does have an incredible singing voice.Listening, did take me back to when Elvis was top of the charts, and it did make me speculate how much today's songs could benefit with Elvis vocals and arrangements.If I have any qualms about, Doug Church as an Elvis impersonator is the misgiving I have about all impersonators. That is why they don't make the effort to learn how to sing with a Southern accent?Finally, I can recommended this CD to any avid Elvis fan without being disappointed after just once around the block."
5,MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!!!,"I recently recieved the 2 c.d.,Kingtinued! It is the best thing I have heard,since the King left us!! I listen to it all the time! DOUG IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!! My 9 yr old loves it more than I do. If thats possible! Keep up the great work,And let us all know,when your next one comes out!!!!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,Very Missing leading it does not even come close to Elvis I don't even play it anymore. Personally it's a waste of money.
1,Me and Einstein,"The book was not at all what I thought it would be about. It hardly even mentioned the story of Einstein not being able to read until he was nine or other famous dyslexic people. The book was an outdated story of a young child who was hiding his secret about not knowing how to read. If the book was brought up to date, it would probably be a more moving story."
2,Not so good product,Not so good product - i do not like and won't buy it again.my taste bud goes for a very good and certainly not bitter chocolate for making a hot gourmet chocolate beverage.not again that's for sureMichele
3,Familiar Formulae Blunt Historical Action.,"In early 1945, 10000 Japanese Marines, fearing execution if they surrendered, took refuge within Manila's Intramuros (""walled city""), a fortress erected by the Spanish in the late 16th century, with 20 foot thickness all about, and during an eight day siege and artillery bombardment by American Army and Philippine freedom fighters, all 10000 of the Japanese Naval troops perished, along with 90000 others, civilians in the main whose home was the narrow passaged fort. This film, generally marketed in the U.S. as THE WALLS OF HELL, features sturdy Jock Mahoney as an American lieutenant in charge of a task force composed primarily of Philippine soldiers ensconced within the outskirts of Intramuros, who do battle continuously with the besieged, the incessant action interspersed with extraneous sub-plots and weakened by less than fine direction, production values and camerawork."
3,The Walls of Hell,"I gave the film 3 stars. If you had the option for half stars, I would have rated it at 2 & 1/2 stars. The film was a little drawn out."
3,"Good for Reds, not for Whites","I've owned one of these wine towers for about a month now. It's a nice design. And it works very well for keeping reds at a serving temp of about 60 degrees fahrenheit. But we like our whites served at about 45 or so degrees and, despite what the literature says about its temperature range, it simply won't go that low in a room with an ambient temperature of app. 73 degrees. 50 was as low as it consistently got even after 48 hours. I spoke with a customer service rep about this and he gave me some suggestions which involved creating enough space on the sides and the back of the unit to insure proper ventilation, but it didn't make any difference.So, a good, nicely designed cooler for reds, but not good at all for whites if you like them with a decent 45 ish degree chill."
5,Prayer studies,Meditations or prayers are very helpful for people with the stress of infertility. My website has changed to a blog I change more than weekly. I have this book on the blog because it meant something to me. There are so few people out there who understand. fertileprayers/blogspot.com for a whole heap of links!
2,For heterosexuals in the very early stages of infertility,This book would be appropriate for heterosexual couples who are still trying to conceive and have not yet seen a doctor about it. Its an extremely simple book and not for the seriously infertile. THe book also never addresses the possibility that a woman may be trying to conceive a child without a man in her life or with another woman. A good book if your sad that you didnt get a positive on a home pregnancy test after your first cycle of trying.
4,A fulfilling end to an amazing story,"I loved the first book, but I always wondered how Asher's story ended. When I discovered there was a sequel, I was a little nervous at first. I wasn't sure if Potok's idea of Asher's future would agree with the way I had imagined it. I need not have worried. This book is a fitting conclusion to a story that began so many years ago."
3,Interesting to a point,"The author provides many insights into the intense religious life of Hasidic Jews, with emphasis on its Brooklyn manifestation. The protagonist finds himself torn between his strict Judaism and his artistic talents. There is no resolution to the conflict, as one might expect. The tension between the ""gift"" and obligations will go on until the end of life. Potok's knowledge of the visual arts is a major strength in this Picasso-haunted novel. He also provides Gentiles such as myself a sympathetic understanding of a people who take their faith very seriously. Alas, I found my attention lagging about three-quarters of the way through, as the detailed descriptions of places and persons for me began to grow tedious."
5,One of the most affecting books I have ever read,"The sequel to My Name is Asher Lev is that rare achievement - better than the first. I re-read the book about once a year and each time long for the third, to know the path down which Asher Lev and his son Avrumel travel. This family and community is so affecting, I find it hard to accept they do not exist. Potok's writing is truly beautiful and each time I read his work I find more to digest."
1,Not as advertised,"They advertised the ""Hornady Improve Shell Plate ( 7.62 Russian)"". This is the Hornady ""improve"" shell plate, not ""improved"", of course. That should have been a sign from above, that the description was written by a foreign clerk, recently fired from a stop and rob. Amazon sold me a discontinued shell plate, for a progressive press no longer made by Hornady, as of last year. Amazon, you need to SAY SO, assuming you take the time to keep up with the products you sell parts for(?). Just say so- ""This is the OLD STYLE shell plate, it will not work with your new press"". See how easy? Wanna bet on when they change the description?"
2,Great one season hat,"I live in South Florida so a hat like this originally was great for yardwork. When it's wet it tends to look a litle more floppy (o.k. and also a bit stupid) than shown in the picture. Those crystals surely do keep you cool but they also destroy the hat over time. This is a one year (or less)hat if you use it often. Little pin holes will appear around the gel area. They will get bigger and the crystals will ooze out. The eyelets will start to rust and discolor the material of the hat. Worse yet, the hat will get moldy and black around the gel area. This happens because those crystals can stay damp for a day or so. Mold is inevitable. Mine was beige like in the picture. Today it goes in the garbage. I bought a Dr. Shade Outback hat at the same time I bought this mold maker and that hat looks like the day I bought it. I used it just as much as the other. It doesn't have the crystals and I don't get it wet but it's a great hot weather hat."
3,Hat review,"It was a great hat, I loved it but then I washed it and it shunk. Now it no longer fits my head."
1,Quality Equals Price,"Yes this is the most economically priced wireless camera on the market. However, the quality matches the price. If you are using this camera outside of a 20ft range from the receiver, you will receive little or no signal. Within 20ft, the signal quality is poor. I would recommend spending a few more dollars and buying a better quality camera. I plan to return the ones I bought."
4,Essential in Africa,I have used this unit for 4 years without complaint. Every six months or so the two 100 ampH batteries need a a top up charge from a seperate charger. We have power cuts almost every night for a couple of hours. This unit switches seemleslesly between mains and battery - the TV does not even blink. Friends have other brands that are burnt out within a year. This Tripp Lite just keeps on going. Well worth the money. 4 stars because of the need to top up the battery charge every now and then.
3,Too expensive!!!!!!,"I remember seeing this classic on VHS back in the mid 80's and it was funny as hell!! I was all set to purchase, untill I saw the price. NO WAY!!! If the price ever drops to something affordable, then, hell, I may purchase two copies."
2,Poor Quality,Found the movie too chopped up - hard to follow. All the actors seemed stiff and emotionless. The book is much better.
1,Portrait of a Lady CD,"Um... you will definitely want to be skipping this version, esply if you have recently read the book. It is so poorly cast, miscast in almost every role, except the American lover, played by Morgenstern. Nicole is average, but everyone else is just not right. A worse travesty, is that Campion ends the movie at the door of the garden, and not in the rooming house the next morning, with Isabel having returning to Italy and her friend cautioning patience. Wow! How could this be?Read, or re-read, the volume, and run James' version of the cinema in your head."
2,Stiff Performances Dominate Portrait of a Lady,"I have seen Nicole Kidman in too many superior performances to blame her (or her fellow actors) for their unfortunate attempts in Portrait of a Lady.The plot has the potential for the diabolical appeal of Dangerous Liaisons. The film is also a visually pleasing period piece.But the manipulating personalities, primarily represented by John Malkovich's character, are not effective.Nicole Kidman's lines come across like she is reading the script from cue cards for the first time.If I had to place blame, I would say the cast was poorly directed, forced to portray this promising story line with a stiff and unconvincing style.Please do not let this example turn you off to ""Other"" (pun intended) Nicole Kidman films."
3,"Small, but good","This is a very little book for a coloring book, but nice.The price is too high as it is marked $1.50 on the back.....I think this should be changed!"
5,One of the best live albums.,"If you're not familiar with 311 or you're new, this album is a must for all fans alike. There are no fillers in this one and it's sure to keep you pleased.A fine note: We're tributed to a drum solo by Chad Sexton on Applied Science. Chad is an awesome drummer and you shouldn't look him over. There are also solos from P-Nut and Tim Mahoney. The quality isn't bad, and I prefer some of these songs live rather then the studio versions. Some great examples are Omaha Stylee, Hydroponic, Who's Got the Herb, Beautiful Disaster, and Nix Hex.Put it in, press play, and enjoy."
3,GO SEE THEM LIVE,"If you haven't seen 311 live, do it now! Seriously, this album proves that they sound just as great.Unfortunatly, this is just a souvenir. It does feature three ample changes (applied Science with it's drum solo, ) and 2 songs not featured on the albums (well, one's rare, who's got the Herb makes it's only appearance here). These songs are must here's, but the rest are just a souvenir, with the atmosphere that most people love. I would rather just see them live whenever I can. I reccomend finding a way to pay for the live songs on a service.This ain't the live expirence. See them live instead, then save the rest for an afterthought. Do the rest.6.0/10"
3,There has to be a better choice.,"Since this is the only Guadalajara map I could find on the internet I bought it to use on an upcoming trip. It will help, but it's not what I expected. First off, I've never seen a large fold-up map like this that has one side totally blank. It's a total waste of space. They cram everything on one side when they had room for another huge map (possibly a more metropolitan area view) on the back. Also, there isn't a decent map showing the airport, which should definitely be included on something claiming to be a ""tourist map"". I'd recommend this map if you can't find anything else and you have (Money) to blow, but there has to be something better out there."

2,Disappointed,This book is great if you haven't had your baby yet. I bought it when my baby was 9 months old. Most of the information was useless by then (lots of maternity and infant info).
3,I should have known,I really wanted this book that I read when I was younger but could not find because of it's age. As soon as I opened it the glue gave out and every page just fell to the ground. Some were in glue chunks but they fell everywhere. I could not even read it. It is not the sellers fault since the book is so old but I do kind of wish they would have opened the book all the way so they would not have sold it.
5,One of Jaffe`s best novels,"Maybe 15 years ago I first read ""Class Reunion"", not knowing at that time that there exists a sequel called ""After the Reunion"".I really loved ""Class Reunion"" and read it several times over the last years.Of course I wanted to read other Jaffe novels, but only two more were published in Germany, ""The last Chance""(which I found as excellent as ""Class Reunion"") and ""The Best of Everything"" which I found kind of hard to read and a bit boring, but the movie with Joan Crawford is very good, much better than the book. Very dramatic, a soap opera.There`s only one other American novelist that I can recommend as much as Rona Jaffe, and that`s Nancy Thayer."
3,Days Songs,"Well for any Days Of Our Lives Fans, this is a must have. There are a few good songs on there. But if you are not into Days that much I wouldn't recommend it. I mainly bought it for the song when Chelsea and Daniel danced on the rooftop ""Forever"".(Which happens to be the same song for Phillip and Belle) Very beautiful song!!! I could not find it anywhere else and personally I just HAD to have it."
1,Awful,"Terrible. No fun at all. Most of these peeps should stick to acting. Songs are, for the most part 'blah'."
1,Stinko,I actually think that some of the glowing reviews HAD tobe written by Moneymaker. This album is boring schlock. The songs are mediocre and some of these folks flat out can't sing.Production's is tired sounding too.
3,Ummmm,"I was quite pleased with most of the CD. I thought the songs were beautiful and sang very nicely. Such powerful voices some of these singers/actors have. However I was less than thrilled to hear the song Easy to Love You, originally sang by Nadia Bjorlin butchered to pieces by someone who cannot hold a proper note. Being a singer myself, I know that the original song and it's notes were on the demanding side and I don't think that they should have had someone who could not following the demands sing this song. I would have much rather not have had it on the CD than to hear this awful rendition of it. However the song that Miss Bjorlin did sing was done wonderfully. It showed off her amazing talent and I look forward to hearing more from her in the future.Over all I give this cd 3 stars. If they want the next Days cd to be better, I would not put Ariann Zucker on it."
2,Not that great,"I love the show. I love the concept. I just think they were trying a little to hard here. I think Peter Reckell is ok at best, and I find that the songs are very formulaic (did I spell that right?). Kyle is great, but I enjoyed him more on the show and other CDs he's been on. Arianna is pleasant, Nadia is obvious but again, this is trying toohard to be a 'real' album and it's not. I agree that it's over produced in spots, and while the songs aren't crap, they're mediocre.Jenny"
5,Fabulous CD,"I could listen to Kelly Moneymaker all day long and I love the good time feel of When Two Chevys Collide by Peter Reckell. There is a very intimate feel to this CD and some really sweet vocals on the tracks...The most notable exception to the sweet vocals is ""Love the Way You Love Me"". Kelly Moneymaker puts goosebumps on my skin and makes me clap my hands to her heartfelt gospel rendition of this song...Talk about goin' to church, whew! It doesn't get any better than this. Nice goin' from the Days of Our Lives cast.I suggest you buy this CD. You'll want to be listening to it all the time.Lynn Fanelli"
5,Great CD!!,"First of all, this CD was given to me as a gift for Valentine's Day because I am a huge fan of the show. I have been waiting to get ""I Am Right Here"" since I first heard it on ""Days"" last April. I love all the songs on this CD and I'm glad that some of my favorite cast members are also singing on it. They did an amazing job, especially Tanya Boyd who sings ""December Rain."" Brent Nelson who composes for ""Days"" has lent his composing and producing talents to this project with Kelly Moneymaker who sings well in a variety of styles. Obviously they know how to craft ""Love Songs."" This is a must have for fans and the only place to get all the other songs we have been waiting for like ""Shadow of Love"" and ""One Last Wish."" A+"
3,All about Kyle Lowder.,"I do not quite like this cd...in fact I think the main vocalist Kelly Moneymaker is not good at all.But Kyle Lowder (Days Brady Black) is amazing, and has a voice worthy of a recording artist. Undone is amazing, and the only song I listen to."
3,Seen it long time ago,I have seen it a long time ago. Not a bad movie Just think if we could do that. Not a bad buy
2,Mediocre,"Weak plat, predictable script, average special effects and ineffectual acting. What else is there to say."
5,Memorable and enthusiastically recommended selections,"Nicholas Gunn is a classically trained and superbly talented flutist, keyboardist, and percussionist. In Through The Great Smoky Mountains, Gunn draws upon his native ability and obvious talent to musically conjure and reflect the spectacular scenery and breath-taking beauty of the Appalachian mountain range that straddles the boarder of Tennessee and North Carolina. The memorable and enthusiastically recommended selections comprising Through The Great Smoky Mountains include: Call of the Wild; The Highest Point; Cade's Cove; Chieftan's Song; The Place Of Blue Smoke; Azalea Sunrise; Trail of Tears; Awakening; Ramsey Cascades; Passage Through Ancient Relics; and Dance of Light."
3,Missed the mark,"Although I am a fan of Nicholas' previous albums, somehow I feel this one just missed the mark. I'm not sure whether it's because he has set up camp with a different crew and is missing the previous artists which added to his signature flute sound or that he just doesn't have the ""Passion"" for the eastern Tennessee mountains as he did for ""The Great Southwest"". My opinion is that all of Nicholas' albums that I have heard have been worth listening to but this one might be better used as background music."
2,"I think this is a rough, rough draft for an Action Film",The back of this paperback book makes this sound much better than it really is and the title doesn't even make sense until mid-point through the book not too mention that it's barely a piece of the novel -- just adds annoying ESP. I only gave it a 2 instead of a one because I think someone like Michael Palmer or one of the other medical mystery writers could spin out an interesting story related to the title.The writing style was also very choppy. Won't read this author again.
3,"I love this little guy's big brother, but for a small can....","I absolutely adore the Pour & Store (standard size) watering cans, and decided to get this small one for my office plants. Granted, I normally just grabbed a small cup for watering my little desk plant and it worked well enough, but I adored this watering can in its large size, and decided to get the mini version.The can worked well enough, but as soon as I tried to swivel the spout, the whole neck of the can popped right off (spilling water everywhere on my desk, dangerously close to my computer). Miffed, I managed to squeeze the swivel-spout back on, but it certainly refused to do any more swiveling after that. All I do now is leave the spout in the ""out"" position, as the waterer is small enough and still fits on my shelf just fine.In any case, be aware and gentle when you ""swivel"" this little guy from the ""store"" position to the ""pour"" position. He's a bit more delicate than his big brother."
1,Leaky,I liked the design but it leaked around the gasket where the spout connects to the body so had to return it.
5,Works excellent and weighs very little.,"Light weight and small, perfect for watering my seeds and house plants.Looks to be an upper class watering can. Worth the money!!!!!!!!"
4,Overpriced but really nice,"So I bought this and then found a watering can this size in a superstore for about $3. So I expected to be disappointed. However, this is the little watering can that could. It's very compact, but seems to stretch to that far away plant very well when in use. It's great for an office when plants can be in spots that are harder to reach.I got this for my new cubicle near the windows. So for this use it's perfect. If I didn't care and just wanted something small and simple I would get a cheap one at a superstore. But this one is really nice."
3,Check that you get the promised Spout,"I ordered this can in green and it came without the promised spout. The seller says that the spout often falls off so she's now putting them in a plastic bag. However, I ordered a second one from Amazon, and it also is missing the spout. I know it says that the spout can be stored in the can, but it's not there either. Have to return both of them now. Will buy from a different seller, or get a different can.It does look cute though, and would be a handy size for watering my worm bin - if only there was a spout... (I can always pour water over the bin; I'm looking for something more efficient than spritzing with a spray can, which gets old fast."
5,Cute and Comfy,"We bought this costume for our teen-age grandaughter. She loved it! It was a little big on her which was just perfect as she went to an outdoor costume party. So she could layer clothes under the costume for warmth and not have to wear a coat on top. Everyone told her she looked great and she was very comfortable in it. It was long enough to be cute, appropriate for a school function, and warm for outside. It's a great product!"
1,Limited Availability,"If it has 'Limited Availability' that suggest SOME availability, yet none can be found.If it is UNAVAILABLE then SAY SO!"
2,Did anyone proof this? Where are the errata?,"I'm only up to page 140 and there are numerous code errors. Some examples:1) There is a reference to ""Appendix A"" but there are no appendices in my copy.2) p 139: he suggests that the expression ""\[1, 2, 3]"" will return an array reference, but this is actually returning a reference to a reference to an array, using 2 levels rather than 1 level of indirection. This wouldn't be crucial except that this is the section of the chapter/book in which he is specifically explaining references.Further, while there is a link to submit errata, there is no link for a place to view/download them. Other reviewers have mentioned the frequency of this kind of error.This book would be a very bad source for someone truly new to perl."
3,another rehash,"just another rehash, a new resuffling of supreme hits. nothing new here!! i already have them all!!"
4,A young M J,It is great to hear Michael as a younger performer and you know why he mad it so big. He was great then too.
2,"The art is bad, the story is worse","The art in Night Cries is cut from the same cloth as Arkham Asylum. If you liked the latter, then there's a good chance that you'll like the former. I personally found the art in both unappealing and uninspired, but to each their own. Night Cries is also drug down by a poor story with too many confusing elements that get further muddled by the poor art."
2,One Man's Views,"This book is poorly written, but far worse is that the author, while making numerous generalizations, cites almost nothing (four pages of notes). A collection of one expert's views without evidential support, John Weiss' book is practically useless to those doing serious research into the Holocaust."
4,I'm impressed,"Who is this guy and how come I haven't heard his music before? David Kilgour opened for Lambchop several months ago. I caught the last 3 songs, and wished I had witnessed his entire set. Anyway, I was impressed enough to buy this CD and it is wonderful chimey, psychedelic guitar pop, but not at all brittle. Except for a few rough edges and a couple of songs that end rather abruptly, this would be a five star effort.The listener will hear dreamy, gorgeous songs featuring layer upon layer of guitar, interspersed with even dreamier, short instrumentals. In the hands of less talented artists, instrumental breaks usually are just filler, but Kilgour isn't just filling space. These are fully realized little pop symphonies that add to the overall effect.Highly recommended."
3,The outcome was funny....,"This knob and its attachments never worked on my gas stove so, I just took the adhesive ring with the oven temp markings and.......just put it on my old knob. A silly, over-priced way to get temp markings on your oven knob but, try to just search and buythe adhesive ring by itself....Probably one of the silliest online purchases I ever made. Doesn't mean it wouldn't work on YOURoven....silly..."
1,Does Not Fit,"This claims to fit most ovens but does not fit Magic Chef. Does come with adapters but they do not help. Waste of money and time. Ace should issue return label, but they are withholding customer satisfaction thus far."
1,Of no use,"The original oven knob has a 3/4"" shaft that extends beyond the face. This oven knob has two adapters that will make a shaft either flush or about 3/8"". Surprising that the ad doesn't state the lengths, or that they don't include one longer adapter that people can cut down to the size they need. Seems simple enough since everything, including the knob is plastic."
2,Oh well...,"I was under the impression that this knob came with adapters which enabled it to be installed on any stove or oven. Since this is not the case, it does not fit my stove (Gaffers & Sattler), so it is of no use to me."
1,Didn't fit my stove,It did not fit my Admiral model 671AD gas range. That range requires a longer knob stem.
1,Not so great,"This DVD is interesting but not that helpful practically speaking. No real advice that you can actually apply. Mostly idealistic, conceptual talk. Also, I'm pretty sure that some of these other reviews are written by the people who made the movie."
5,I learned so much about the MUSIC BUSINESS!!!,"Well, when it comes to getting first hand knowledge as to how the music industry functions, you can't go wrong by watching this one. The amazing part about it is that it contains footage from both artists and executives. So, I really felt like I was able to see both sides of the music industry; the struggle to make it as an artist (such as myself), and struggle to become an executive. It was also just cool to hear people like Sting, Fred Durst, and Rob Zombie talk about their thoughts on the industry rather than their music. Anyways, if you have any aspirations of getting into the music industry this would be a great place to start. I use this dvd as my coach and inspiration"
1,Not a good choice,"Unless you want your assets spilling out, you'll need to wear a shirt under this one. Poor fit. Not well made. I returned it."
2,"not too bad , but...","The book is very simple to read and understand, but there is a problem. The example presented seems to be tailor-made to demonstrate the use of different features of OMT and Booch methods. Now when you try to apply these to the project that you are actually doing, you find yourself asking the same questions as you were doing before. In real life, projects don't sit up and beg to be OO-ised."
5,A Solid Performance By Ms.Jennifer Beals!!!,"This movie is about a Parole Officer played by Jennifer Beals who falls in love with one of her ex cons . This does not sound like a very original storyline but this movie is enhanced and redeemed by a very believable and solid performance by Jennifer Beals. Sadly we do not see enough of her in movies these days which is a real shame because I think she is one very talented , underrated actress. Bravo Ms. Beals!!! (And she is pretty HOT too!!!)"
4,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT","JENNIFER BEALS PLAYS JENNY A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL PAROLE OFFICER WHO AGAINST HER BETTER JUDGSMENT FALLS IN LOVE WITH ONE OF HER PAROLEE'S. HE IS AN EX-CON WITH AN OLD SCORE TO SETTLE ON THE OUT SIDE. HE KEEPS JENNY IN THE DARK ABOUT THE OLD SCORE TO SETTLE PUTTING BOTH THEIR LIVES IN JEOPARDY. JENNY IS TRAPPED IN A DANGEROUS GAME OF SEDUCTION AND DESIRE AND GETS TOO CLOSE TO THE EX-CON WHO HAS THE POLICE IN HOT PERSUIT. THE TWO MUST STAY TOGETHER TO STAY ALIVE, AND IN LOVE. JM"
2,"Predictable movie, gorgeous Holt McCallany!","I love Holt McCallany, so anything he has done will naturally catch my attention. He is the lead in this movie, which is pleasant enough to watch, despite not being particularly extraordinary.The story is simple and a bit predictable, but the acting is decent and if you are a Holt McCallany fan like I am, you will love him in this one, especially the way he looks: absolutely sexy!"
2,Out of Line,"Jennifer Beal was beautiful as always, this was a ""B"" movie but entertaining. Yes buy it."
3,Not the Best,"Intrigued by Holt McCallany in CSI:Miami, I have been on a quest to find other works by him. This is definitely not his best. The acting is contrived and the plot is old and not well executed (parole officer falls for ex-con who's out of prison and trying to settle a score). If you are looking for good movies with Holt in them, try Below or The Fight Club. If you insist on buying this movie, make sure you buy a bottle of Electric Reindeer White Zinfadel (or another alcoholic substitute--I was in the holiday spirit at the time). The alcohol will help you make it through to the end. Sorry, Holt!"
4,"Reception is great, '01 Jetta","Yes the hardware is oversized, so take a look inside the cavity and use your hands to find an opening to stuff this thing into. I found one quickly, dropped the antenna in and I've got great reception on my aftermarket head unit now. Very happy."
2,antenna,Had to buy this for my aftermarket stereo in my bug. My reception is worse now... Not sure if it's the adapter or what.
2,Documentary My Dear Rat,First I would like to say the transfer from film to DVD is only mediocre. Some of the dark battle scenes in the original go completely black on DVD. This movie starts out like a documentary in Australia with the commentator talking about the Australian cattle ranchers. From time to time through out the movie it goes back to a documentary style. This bored me to the point that I fast forwarded it to the point they go off to war. The rest of the movie moves at a decent pace and the acting isn't to bad. Peter Finch is in it and turns in a fair performance. However; there are a couple scenes where the commanders are planning their battle tactics that are very stiff. Overall the movie just doesn't make it in my library of those WWII movies to own. If you are really into Australia's war movies you may find this more redeeming than I did. I'm giving my DVD to a charity.
1,BETTER CHOICES FOR TOBRUK,"If you are interested in the battle of Tobruk,you would be betteroff opting for two Richard Burton movies about thIS battle:The Desert Rats or Raid on Rommel."
1,The Afrika Korps nowhere to be seen on this movie!,"The sign of the times, typical 1940's movie, the only thing you see in this movie is just the Aussies, not a single German featured in this movie(you won't see the AFRIKA KORPS anywhere in this movie) This is perhaps the most dissapointing Desert war movie of all.......(and i have and seen ALL there is)"
4,Lay This Laurel,This book was purchased for my partner who is extremely interested in the American Civil War & having seen the film Glory was interested in the first regiment of black soldiers in the war. He tells me that it was very informative together with excellent photographs and very much a 'coffee table' book and not one to hide away in our bookcase! I have visited Boston but do not recall having seen this memorial and this has inspired us both to consider another visit in the near future.
3,Not my favorite one of the four,this book was not what I remembered. I read this book and the other 3 several years ago. This story is not my favorite.
4,Super Fun look at Nostalgic Radio,"""Superman With Batman and Robin"" is good fun radio. I have always been impressed with Bud Colyer's portrayal of Superman from radio, the Fleischer Cartoons, and the 60s TV series. But now we have a 20 cassette collection of 119 radio programs to enjoy. On top of enjoying these old programs, we get a rare treat of listening to the original Superman 1939 audition called ""Clark Kent Reporter""! (Never aired). And we get to hear the last season of Superman where Collyer is replaced by Michael Fitzmaurice, who unfortunately simply cannot recreate Collyer's Superman voice. The reason I do not give it 5 stars is because there are some bad recordings in a few episodes, and also, I have to admit that I do get tired of the number of ""Kelloggs PEP"" commercials heard throughout the programs. But overall it is great family entertainment and I hope that RADIO SPIRITS crank out even more titles as time goes on. It's true SUPER FUN!"
4,The Trio of Heros on Radio,"It was radio that first teamed up Batman,Robin and Superman.Here are the complete,unabridged episodes!I like these tapes because all the action takes place in your imagination,not as some one else thinks it should look like!I also like the way Bud Collyer gives different voices to Superman and Clark Kent.We even here him in the first episode-as Jor-El!The music is campy and the commercials can get annoying,but if you like the keros,classic radio or both this set is a must.If you just want to enjoy these superheros in a different way,that's SUPER too!"
2,What's Up with this guide??!!,What is up with the guides lately?Can they NOT get a walkthrough correctly?!IF you want to get almost everything in the game this is NOT the guide for you! Many errors! It tells you to go west when you should go east in many places. Also leaves you hanging in areas where you NEED detailed help.Had to call the Nintendo help line so many times for certain areas of the walkthrough. Mind you I played the game more than 1/4th without a guide.SAVE YOUR MONEY and go print a walkthrough from gamefaqs.comI am surprised because most Brady guides are good. This one will have you walking around in circles!I am ordering the OFFICIAL NINTENDO guide and hoping it will be better for the Oracle Of Seasons part.Nowadays you take a chance ordering game guides :( Even one guide I had ordered from Nintendo was so wrong I had to call them and give them ALL the corrections.Such sloppy work nowadays. DISGUSTING! And yet they want to make money doing these things. HA!
1,Love the movie but the image quailty is ridiculous.,I saw this movie in my teens and remembered it fondly. While I still enjoyed the film itself this is just a VHS slapped onto a DVD. On the upside this DVD really makes one appreciate the video formats we have now.
4,The Third Episode,"This episode is the third Lone Ranger episode, which is a continuation of the first two episodes. You can't buy just this tape and expect to know what's going on. To get the rest of the story, you need to get the first two episodes. There are two tapes that have the first three episodes: ""Enter the Lone Ranger"" and ""Legend of the Lone Ranger."" I have both of those, and I would recommend ""Enter the Lone Ranger"" because it has superior quality to ""Legend of the Lone Ranger."" However, ""Legend of the Lone Ranger"" does have one scene that for some reason ""Enter the Lone Ranger"" doesn't have, so maybe you'll want to get both. In any case, these tapes are definitely a must-have for any Lone Ranger fan."
3,The spoon cold be more narrow.,"The plate/bowl is great. A lot wider than I expected, but has a nice no slip grip on the bottom. The spoon handles are a great size and very easy to hold, but the actual spoon part was a little bit too wide for our 15 mth old to fit in her mouth. The spoons had a good depth to scoop up food, but our daughter couldn't fit her mouth around the spoon without opening it really wide, so she ended up ""sipping"" out of the spoon instead. Otherwise, the set is well made and easy to clean. Will probably work best for an older child with a wider mouth than our little girls. But, then again, if the kid was older, then the spoon handles would be too short, 'cause right now they fit her hands perfectly."
3,Colorful!,"I ordered the red bowl and love its shape and color. The spoons are a hit with my grandson, although he prefers chewing on the handle to eating from the actual spoon...perfect for his grip and satisfies his need to chew!! The only negatives I have found is that when I put sweet potatoes in the bowl (they were not warmed in the bowl), the white dish discolored and secondly, the hard plastic of the dish is a ""7""...the hard plastic that can emit toxins when heated."
3,Stain doesn't go away,"This set is made of really quality rubber, matte finish. The design is nice and smart. But for some reason, the stain (from feeding my niece papaya) can't be cleaned - very annoying and disappointing. I would not recommend this over other much cheaper products."
2,Way over priced,"I wouldn't have a problem spending nearly $20 on a plate for my son to use provided it would stay in place, be difficult to launch across the room or clean easily. Alas this doesn't fit the bill.Nothing special with the plate, just another chunk of plastic dinnerware to be buried in the pantry along with the rest (at a quarter of the price). I'm pretty disappointed."
2,Ridiculously priced and kinda ugly actually...,"I thought this bowl and spoon were pretty cool at first and decided to buy them even though the price is ridiculous. After using them for a while, the plate and spoon both got stained from food, they were much harder to clean than other bowls, i realized the plate looks more like a dog bowl then a kid's plate, and i found myself not using them as much as my other normal plates. All in all, I wanted to buy the best for my baby and thought that spending this much money on a plate and spoon must mean it's a pretty good plate and spoon, but they really aren't, so don't bother."
2,No better than any other plate,"I bought this hoping it would help my son use the spoon against the side and keep from picking up his plate (as advertised). Well, it really made no difference compared to the cheap plates and spoons we had purchased, and in fact my son did not like the width of these spoons (too difficult/wide to get into his mouth) so we stopped using them. The plate is more difficult to push, doesn't slide as easily, but my son has no problem picking it up.I suggest saving your money and buying a less expensive plate since the food will end up all over the floor anyway."
3,spoons let down,"The plate is fantastic; a great size and the shape convenient. The spoons are a little wide for my 7 month old son, so I don't use them, hence the low rating."
2,Plate is too big,"The spoons are great for a toddler. The plate is very much like a dog bowl. It is little too bulky and a pain to store since you cannot stack that easily with your other bowls. If I were to do it again, I would just buy the spoons only."
4,high quality but a bit pricey,"We ordered these bowl/spoon combos because when I went to the store to buy some for my baby, everything was made in China! Call me paranoid, but with all the lead found in their toys/toothpaste/dog food/etc., I'm not taking a chance on something that's going in my baby's mouth every day. So I found these sets that are made in Sweden. Right now I guess I'm not using it the way it's made for, because I feed my 5 month old daughter myself, so she's not learning how to use it on her own yet (she tries though). But it still gets the job done, and the spoons fit her mouth really well. It's quite pricey, but that isn't an issue for us when it comes to quality."
2,Maybe I should have known,"I read most of the reviews. I thought I'd give it a try. I'm now assuming that most of the reviewers had kids younger than mine because at 14 mo. I am just starting with the utensils/dish. When I gave it to him he picked it right up and promptly dumped all of his food out. So, no go for us. It looks great but for a dish that really doesn't stay in place at all and is easily picked up, I'll go spend $5 on something cute and functional instead of $18. Perhaps the rating I gave it too low, but I really expected more. Bad me?"
2,not as described,"bowl did not have enough slip resistant base to keep it from moving on baby's tray as stated in the description. It was suppose to be hard for baby to pick up, it was really easy for baby to pick up."
3,"It does the job, but nothing special","I think it serves the purpose of a dish for a small child, however it's nothing special. My son, 18 months old, is still able to pick it up off the table and dump it out. I love to use it as a shallow bowl for cereal, where my son can scoop things from it easily, but for dinner it doesn't have compartments and thus all the food runs together in one pile."
5,Sturdy & easy for my girl to feed herself!,I really like this plate. The edges are design in a way that the food doesn't dance around while my toddler is trying to scoop it. It makes teaching using utensils a lot easier. I also love the look of the plate and spoons. They have funky and fun colors! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!
4,Good baby bowl and decent spoon,"This bowl is relatively hard for my daughter to tip over, and it is supposedly dishwasher and microwave safe. These are the reasons I bought it. Many other plastic bowls are melamine or contain BPAs and should not be microwaved. That does not appear to be an issue with this one.The spoons are OK. They are a bit too wide and not as soft on teething babies' gums as some of the more rubbery options on the market, but they are fine and have nice stubby handles for babies to hold onto.My bowl did not come with a black spoon like in the picture. I received the advertised pink spoon, but my secondary spoon was green. For me, that was fine and even preferable, but if for some reason you're really excited about a black spoon with your pink bowl, beware."
5,Great plate and spoons,"This plate and spoons set has been great for us. Our daughter loves having her own plate, and we take it everywhere - restaurants, vacations, friends' homes. It is non-slip and very stable, but not unmoveable by a determined child. Fortunately for us, our daughter so far does not pick up the place until it is empty, so we haven't had to deal with her throwing a full plate on the floor (yet). The rounded edges are nice for little hands, and the 3-leaf clover shape helps make scooping food easier. The spoons are so cute, and very easy to use. We are overall very happy with it."
1,Nonsense,Does this book say that Karabagh is an essential part of Azerbaijan and its occupied by Armenian armed forces?
3,Nice pattern intention. Not practicle for hobbist.,"This problem I had was that the little rib around the large center button kept chipping across the wood grain. I made a jig for the stock and bolted everything down. I was using a medium duty drill press on the slowest speed with slow and steady pressure. It still caused pine, oak, maple, and zebra wood to chip out. So then I used it on a professional milling machine with digital read out and the pattern cut perfect. Beautiful design but you need to have good equipment and good wood.. duh. Being my first time trying to cut, I learned some things the hard way and ended up doing some damage to a brand new cutter right away."
4,Brule Rocks!,Wonderful blend of electronica with traditional! Nicole's flute floats and dances above Paul's fascinating keyboards.
3,"Interesting, provocative and flawed","Black Candle succeeds in its prose poems that a vignettes of the difficulties of life as a South Asian. The poems also work if one judges them as vignettes rather than poetry. Yoga Lessons is the strongest piece as poetry. Even as vignettes, however, the ubiquous use of first person, which works well for the poems in isolation, fails to work in the collection as the reader gets many ""I's"" of which some are the same and others not. The book does as excellent job of making the foreign culture and environment accessible to Americans.This book reminds me most of Jana Harris' work where pioneer women's stories are made into poetry. If you enjoyed that, you'll surely enjoy this,"
3,"Good for beginners, but not up to the O'Reilly name","This is a good book for beginners but I was sorely dissapointed. A better title would be: ""Information Architecture - An Introduction""Having purchased this book based on the O'Reilly name, I was saddened to find that it did not contain the ""meat"" or technical breadth I have come to rely on with other O'Reilly titles.However, I have given my copy to a number of people as an introduction to the topic. I think it does an excellent job of laying out the issues in a manner almost anyone can understand."
4,Great Management Book,"There are more advanced books for explaining information architecture to someone looking to actually design information systems for the web, but there are few better books for explaining to a manager the value of IA for an organization. The first half of the book seeks to explain the difference good and bad design can have on a user's experience in finding information. Although the examples are at times more cerebral (compared to Jakob Nielsen's Designing Web Usability, who picks websites and suggests how navigation and organization could be changed for a better user experience) the book's value comes from effectively communicating the design vocabulary necessary for an information designer to communicate his or her vision to management."
4,Mostly for IA guys,"This is a classic book to have on the importance of planning, and the art of researching towards easier implementation. It gives excellent review on the various tasks a large-scale project should work through.This book is mostly targetted for IA wanna-be. Web developers and project managers will benefit only from 7-8 chapters.I think the authors had focused too much on why IA is important, rather then how to implement it correctly. A large percentage of the ink was wasted on what is IA and how you should sell it. I would love to see another case study or two.All in all, this is a nice book to have. The chapters I liked most was on the labels, grouping, controlled vocabularies and case studies."
4,An update on existential psychotherapy,"This little book is an excellent summary of existential psychotherapy. It begins with a brief and clear summary of existential philosophy, then reviews the major sub-schools of existential psychotherapy. The book discusses some historical developments within existential psychotherapy that were strangely lacking from my graduate school text, but its major value is bringing the reader almost up to date with what is happening in this field. The book is well written and pleasantly free of some of the prejudices that occasionally arise in existential circles against spiritual and religious ideas. My only real problem with the book is its cost: Surprisingly expensive for such a short book. Even so, it is well worth the read for psychotherapists who want to deal with the deeper issues with which their patients struggle."
4,"Expensive, but good book","So far this book has been very good. I'm reading it for a class, and it's interesting and relatively engaging (esp considering it is a textbook!). It's too bad such a small book has to be so expensive though."
4,An Old Man's Voice; A Young Man's Idealistic View of Love,"Stephin Merritt's evocative score for Eban and Charley is a musique concrete version of his others projects (Magnetic Fields, The 6ths, etc.). The instrumentals are tinkling, childlike backdrops incorporating the sounds of crickets, music boxes, toy pianos, rain storms, etc., fitting for a film about the relationship between a 29-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy. The lyrical songs feature a muted version of Merritt's grand irony and romanticism - again, in keeping with the film's clear-eyed depiction of its touchy subject matter. Whether or not the relationship in the film is consummated, the longing in these songs is palpable, painful. Merritt's dry croak of a singing style - an old man's voice married to a young man's idealistic view of love - is creepy in this context, and all the more convincing for it."
2,Vichy France,The history is good but hard to read without insights into the people and the aftermate after the war.
3,submarine attack,"This movie is okay to watch, but it's a little boring. When there is action the movie is good, when they sink a ship. Other than that it is a routine patrol of an Italian U-boat. Not a bad movie if you are really interested in submarines."
5,Buy this book!,This is the best book I have yet run across for J2EE architecture. This book is a treasure trove of practical advice and examples. Rod also debunks and corrects many of the classic myths and misunderstandings of J2EE.
5,The best J2EE Design Book,"I bought this book because I've read very good reviews. I found this book amazing. This books shows you how to make good designs and develop in J2EE, all the chapters with full of comments from Rod's experience. Many of the concepts of this book were later applied in Spring framework. I strongly recommend read this book for advanced Java developers."
5,The best value for a book: EXPERT EXPERIENCE!!,"I have a lot of books and it is the best book I had never. This book is not theorical, no, it offers lots of experience, tips and definitions that can convert you to a true j2EE Expert. Work with bigger J2EE applications without doubts because this book will help you to carry out them."
5,The best value for a book: EXPERT EXPERIENCE!!,"I have a lot of books, this is the best book I had never. This book is not a theorical book, no, it offers a lot of experience tips and definitions that can convert you to a true j2EE Expert"
4,"Insightful in many ways, but left me hanging","There's no doubt that Rod knows what he's talking about. Much of the book contained best practices that were incredibly valuable, and he seemed to have a focused direction that he wanted to take us in - not just re-hash the J2EE specification.However, I felt like was left hanging at the end of the book. He talks about a sample application throughout his discussions on design and the source code for the application is available from wrox's (the publisher) website. But after downloading and compiling the application, I discovered that most of the web tier was left incomplete. Apparently, he leaves us to make our own decision about implementing the web-tier, but it would be nice to see at least one option illustrated completely.All that talk about this sample application and I couldn't even run it and play with it to reinforce what I learned."
5,Great Book,"Great discussion of J2EE design and development. This is not a beginners book. It has a lot of great material on the pitfalls of J2EE development and how to avoid the traps. Reads like a true ""one-on-one"" discusson from an expert developer.Check out the author's work in the Spring framework: http://www.springframework.org/"
4,Great book !,"It is a great book. But I give it only 4 stars is because it is hard to read. English is my 2nd language. I cannot read this book quickly. I even need check dictionary at least 2 times per page. I do not have the same problem when read other tech books.""What is WebSphere"" is another book I like. Also help me to learn system level stuff. It is much easier to read. Though it does not have so many stuff like Johnson's book.I would like to suggest the auther to consider many tech readers are not very good at English."
2,"Lite on action and screams, big on laughs","A kind hearted but poor clerk with a mean boss and lazy wifemeets a friendly spirit which helps him become a new man.Unlike films like many of the films with a supernatural elementthis one cuts back on the action and scares in favour of humour.In style I would describe it as an asian version of South Park as there is running gag involving a magic penis which makes the film worth seeing. The poor production values in the set design, costumes and special effect let stop me from giving thisfun film more than 2 stars."
2,wierd little demon dick,"an odd film no doubt but interesting. plenty of boobies, not the best looking ones but tossable.not a must see in my book, unless you really got a thing for chinese chicks and retarded comedies"
5,"good, solid mystery","This is a mystery that explores the politics and culture of South Korea through a couple of military investigators and a Korean detective. It has a lot of plot twists that make you wonder if the cops will ever figure out who the culprit is. Right before it ends, the reader has to suspect everyone. The dialog zips right along making for a good quick read."
5,A book that flows to the readers with ease,"The Commander was an excellent read. Not very many books are written in a first-person format, but it is a great way to write. The story is first-rate, with compelling, believable characters."
2,Commanding,"I surmise most these reviews have been written by men. Not knowing anything about the Asian culture I found this story to be just terrible. The brutality and utter disregard about the welfare of people, women especially was a total downer. I felt nothing but revulsion reading this story. No characters to admire at all and no integrity to each other. Anyone could be bought and everyone betrayed everyone else. Very heavy reading and not for the light hearted. And that was during peacetime?"
1,bad taste,"The box is very pretty and the product overall is good, but I really hated the taste is so bitter that it becomes impossible to drink it, but that is only my personal opinion it all depends on everybody's taste for stuff."
2,Pretty gross..,"The vanilla made it taste better, but I ended up giving this away because I couldn't stand the taste! Maybe rooibos tea isn't for me.."
2,Meh,"The packaging was bad to begin with, it was in a yellow envelope and the box was crushed. Then the tea itself... Well it was tolerable, but not very good. It just had this strong chemical-vanilla flavor, so I won't be ordering again."
1,Superficial and Obtuse,"From the pretentious title to the closing footnotes, Diller and Scofidio go to great lengths to make their architecture seem more complex than it is. Their pseudo-intellectual inquiries may sound impressive to students, but do not stand up to sophisticate scrutiny. There is nothing useful or intelligent in this striving but empty volume."
5,I need a return,I accidentally go the wrong size!!! I put xxs and I meant xs. I tried to put it on my dog and it won't fit. Can I please return it and get an xs??? It looks amazing and I really want my doggy to have it
3,Steer clear of the XX-Small,"The diaper itself is really well put together, however I ordered the XX-Small (the listing says it is for dogs under 4 lbs) and it was too small even for my 7-week-old Yorkie (1 lb). What other kinds of dogs is that size supposed to fit?"
3,Not good for male dogs,"This does not work well with male dogs. First, it doesn't even clear the dogs manhood and second the tail hole is to big to catch anything else."
3,Seems larger than we expected compared to other brands,"Purchased a set for our shitzu female, who is a bit plump to be perfectly honest. We have tried small diapers from Petco on her and they are, literally, a stretch. We tried these mediums thinking we'd be in a better place. These dwarf her. Sophie weighs in around 15#, and these can be removed without unfastening. We will probably return. The quality of the diaper is good, but sizing is a bit off."
3,Get size,I have a westie and I thought she was a little bigger than small because small was really tight on her so I bought med-which she can get out of unless it is tight on her-Be carefull which size you get
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED!,"Ordered this because, as the image shows, it was a full on doggy DIAPER.My boyfriend and I were excited to receive this product as we have 'belly bands' already for our senior dog, however, we wanted something with a bit more coverage and absorbency. So.. you can imagine our shock when this arrived and it's not a doggy diaper at all. Rather, it's simply an elasticated belly band! No coverage over the behind for the tail to poke through-- It is *not* a diaper.Blatant false advertisement. We are extremely unimpressed. How you can show an image of one product, and then deliver an entirely separate product is absolutely beyond me."
3,Good and Bad,"I had to get a smaller size than what the chart recommended. Cons....the leg openings are too big, so they leak. Also, not waterproof. Urine goes right through to the outside. Pros...works well for us with a baby diaper or depends or pull ups underneath. We couldn't use a disposable diaper alone because they wouldn't stay on. These pants fit snugly at the waist and hold the diaper on. Could be better, but a big help anyway."
2,PoochPad,"Came when promised and was well constructed however, There are not enough sizes. The small is too small and the next size to to big. We bought both and neither work."
2,Pooch pads,I was hoping for something I could use with a seperate pad. This diaper is thick and cumbersome for a small dog. Purchased two returned the unused one. Unfortunately could not return the one I used on dog. Would probably be OK without all the padding
2,One Time Use,"I bought this to help my puppy with potty training. She absolutely HATED it, and I came home to find her howling uncontrollably with a soaked diaper. After washing, the diaper was so stiff that I didn't dare try to put it back on her, as she hated it enough the first time around."
4,the first ones that I got were to small but loved the secfont ones,loved the pooch pants had to send the first one back to small but is was the first time my dog needed diapers in her first heat. they washed well and dryed well and I should have these for a long time.
3,Was too small,"Don't really know what to rate this because it was too small to even try on my little 6 lb. Chihuahua - 9 1/2"" waist and I ordered the XXS. I couldn't get both sides on. Wishing I had the next size up.1/30 UPDATE: Since then I've noticed my dog usually ends up fitting a Small rather than an XS. Even so, I wonder if this in a small would fit him (the xs was so tiny). There is no sizing chart from the seller. When I ordered this my dog was new to me and this was one of the first things I purchased for him. Luckily he doesn't need any more help with potty training. I have other dogs and he has learned skills from being 'part of the pack'. He goes potty outside with them now."
3,Again Very Well Made - not Waterproof on the outside,"Very disappointed that they are not waterproof.I have PoochPants washable floor pads and they really are a great, durable product. Very washable! Hopefully they'll make a product that is waterproof on the outside so the wetness doesn't get everything else wet as well!"
2,Like Goldilocks,"We bought two sizes for our aging four pound, sneaky, piddling chihuahua; an Xsmall and an XXsmall. The first was too big and the second was too small. When we were able to keep one on her for more than a few minutes, she would move in reverse. She went backwards everywhere until she could wiggle out of them. And to show us who was boss, she would sneak a piddle in a middle of the floor. The idea was a good one but the practical application was a failure. We're still looking for that fix that is just right."
2,Just okay!,I use Diapers for my little yorkie all the time she runs free in the house. This particular brand runs small. Other than that it was fine.
3,"Love the color, not the consistency","I was so excited when I got this polish and saw how unique the blue shade was. When I used it I realized that it is not a creme polish or even a creme jelly, but a very VERY thin blue jelly. To be opaque on its own you would have to use about 4 coats. For me, it ended up being waaaay too thick and the color was just off. It does lend itself well to layering and jelly sandwiches though."
3,A Good Weekend read,"Mannix starts out the book in quick fashion with the history of other notable ""clubs"" of 18th centrury England. He then goes into the coloful histories of the more notable members with emphasis on Dashwood and Wilkes. A think he gets off-course when he tries ot tie every single signifigant event of the time to the club itself. The book itself is a very quick read and quite intriguing at parts. It does repeat itself sometimes (almost verbatim)."
2,Not historical - a work of fiction,"I purchased this book thinking it was an historical non-fiction piece intending it for research. It's a pseudo-fiction (creative non-fiction?) book that rampages across a strange and unfamiliar London. An interesting if visceral and potentially disturbing read. Well written in a style that is reminiscent of William S. Burroughs and sober but more sardonic Hunter S. Thompson. Nevertheless, i'm still left looking for research materials."
5,lots of bubbles,"I take a bath everyday and this is my absolute favorite bubble bath. The other herbaflor bath do not create bubbles like rosemary. Trust me, I have tried them all. I just am waiting for the 3 in a pack deal."
3,A ride...at the most,"First of all, Freddie Prinze, Jr? That's odd. Until today I hadn't seen him in a movie that I'd enjoyed completely. Scratch that. I still haven't.The deeper the plot got, the more confused I became. I'm not a simplton, either. I honestly don't know why half the people that died, died.It's also harder to give a movie more than three stars on a review when a key line in the movie is, ""If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'."" Why not just make it, ""What's up doc?"" or even ""That's what she said."" Those are sadly more amusing.The random sex scene was also annoying. ""I just got the fool beat out of me ... again. Wanna mess around?"" It didn't flow. The only thing more enjoyable than counting the times Jericho (Prinze) got the fool beat out of him were the very very few twists in the plot.Don't buy this movie. Rent it from Blockbuster if you have a movie pass and you've already seen what else is out there."
1,Awful,"A terrible film on every level. The story is unbelievable as well as unrealistic. The characters are not only hard to believe, but are not sympathetic so you really don't care. There is so much slang inserted into the dialogue that's it almost incomprehensible -- they actually have a special feature on poolhall slang which I guess we're supposed to watch first. Seeing a few well done pool shots well executed is the only positive thing I can say about this mess, but that it's not enough to warrant even a rental, as you can see that on ESPN. You're better off watching ""The Hustler"" and ""Color of Money"" for a 3rd, 4th or 5th time than watching this travesty even once."
2,Junk,Not nothing that i thought it would be. Not much in pool playing would not get if you want a movie about pool playing. I plan on giving it away or throwing it away.
3,3.5 stars,"This movie had potential although in some ways it is a rip off of ""The Hustler"" with Paul Newman and thats one of the reasons this movie suffered because Freddie Prince JR sure is not Paul Newman If you have seen The Hustler than maybe you can give this movie a shot ,, I dont know what the other reviewer was talking about with the slang it is understandable I didnt really notice any slang in the movie .. The bright spots of the movie are Ving Rhames, your always going to get a good performance from , he played his part well and Roselyn Sanchez, I have not seen her in any movie previous to this one , Not only is she beatiful but she can actually act this is usually uncommon with beatiful actresses. Really those where the only two reasons I bought this movie cause I am a Ving Rhames fan and I wanted to see Roselyn Sanchez. Overall for about 3 bucks I would say it is possibly worth owning but for the price of renting it you might as well just buy it"
2,Shooting Gallery,"I thought the movie had poor acting and a terrible plot. What should I have expected with Freddie Prinze Jr. though. I wouldn't recomend this video if you are a pool junkie like I am. I'm still waiting for the next great movie to take over where the ""Color of Money"" left off. I think it's about time for one."
2,"Unrealistic, unmotivated, and uninteresting","I don't know where these morons developed their grim view of pool and pool players, but it wasn't in a poolroom. First off, pool hustlers are charming (the better to relieve you of your money), unlike the venemous, scenery-chewing characters in this flick. (As an aside, today's tournament players are as likely to pull you aside and ask about the state of your salvation as to hustle you.) The only nod to realism is a string of trick shots--but try setting your drink on the rail in a real poolroom and the manager will run over with a quick dose of realism. As for the story, forget it. Lack of character development leaves little room for interest anyhow."
1,Boring,"To make a long movie short, this movie sucks. Don't waste your time. Most pool movies suck. If you want to see a good pool movie watch stickmen. Its a independent film from New Zealand but it is really good."
4,Enjoyable,Think revenge in a pool hall. Hustlers get hustled and a deadly game plays out when a crooked cop and a pool hustler cross paths. I don't want to give away too much of the plot.When's the last time we saw Freddie Prinze Jr? This movie is worth the price of seeing Ving Rhames suck on chicken feet. By the end of the movie you're confused as to just who is going to come out on top. It's cheap pool movie entertainment and worth a rental.
2,dissappointed,was not newI was dissappointed the product was previously purchashased and sent from someone else's address. I would not have bought it.
4,Throwback Hippie Cookbook--Love the style!,"I like hippie cookbooks: the return to natural foods, the peace-love vibe, all of it. This one doesn't disappoint, and the recipes are rather unusual like the Cranberry Anadama Bread. Fun."
5,Friendly and easy to understand,I found Dr. Homola's book reader friendly and easy to understand. His book really helped me understand what is causing my back pain and what to do about it. There is a wealth of information on how to recognize and treat all kinds of aches and pains. He tells you how to help yourself and when you should see a doctor.I'd recommend this book for anyone who wants a real self-help guide that explains the problem and then offers good advice or an effective remedy. I keep this book handy for quick reference when any member of my family has a back or body problem. I wouldn't be without it.
5,The Chiropractor's Complete Self-Help Back and Body Book:,"I found Dr. Homola's book to be very beneficial. His straight forward approach to problems and cures was refreshing. Having been in the care of many chiropractors over the years, its an eye opener to read some practical ways to lead one to better health. The only people that would have a harsh opinion about this book are those with an ulterior motive or who do not understand that a simple way of helping people to better health is the best way."
1,gives me aches to read this,"beisdes some exercises and self help sections i found this book to be very dry and thought i was in school to be a Dr, not your average self help book. THis book was too much, and yet somehow not enough"
3,smaller than described,"This polyester llama toy is durable and soft. However, it is a bit smaller than advertised. The product description says 10x4x14, but it is actually about 8x3x12. Maybe you could say it's 13"" high if you count the ears"
2,Disappointed,"Ten Things Every Child Needs did not meet MY needs! I had hoped to share it with young, inexperienced or less well-educated parents whose infants I treat, to improve their parenting skills. The tape was much too long and more oriented to educated and professional people. The VHS format was the only format available. If it were on DVD, it would have helped: a parent might watch selected sections that were most pertinent."
1,Crumbling paint,Really cheap. Paint coming off before I even took them out of the envelope they came in. Can't have near toddlers
4,long needed and necessary for indian history,This book has been a Godsend to me for researching specific Native American legislation. The book saved me weeks of time by zeroing in on specific congressional legislation germaine to Native Americans. The book is clear and concise enough to give any researcher the actual law or document related to N.A. History
5,a 311 concert in your room,The original songs are of course better but this album shows a couple rarities and makes you listen to 311 at a concert - great.
3,Nice but NOT the original,"This collection of TV Themes songs is composed of rather well done versions done by this band and composer. They are NOT the versions you heard when you saw the show, however."
3,"""Missed by this much....""","I agree with others.....It was fun listening to these ole theme tunes, but unfortunately they are not the ""originals"" as played with the broadcast episodes that many of us took pleasure watching and listening to in the 50's and 60's. These are apparently after-market, all-in-one studio orchestral recordings.I think most of us were hoping for all of the originals to be compiled into this album.There are sections, as in Route 66, that the lead electric guitar is almost grating as compared to the TV original that came across much more orchestral (strings if I remember correctly).Still I'm happy to add it to my eclectic collection of music."
4,Good Multi-Purpose Music,"A good funk jazz disc to listen to while you're working, cleaning the house, driving, cooking dinner, etc. It rises above the level of the Smooth Jazz station on your cable tv, but not to the level of a 5-star recording."
4,A Glowing Portrait,"From the beginning, it is obvious that Remini is fascinated by Jackson. Every description of Jackson fawns over his political acumen, his skills, his bravery, etc. And, as mentioned in another review, as soon as Jackson wins the Battle of New Orleans, ""the Hero"" becomes a synonym for ""Jackson"" for the rest of the book. Setting aside how brightly the portrait of Jackson glows, Remini's biography is an excellent introduction to the man and the age he ushered in. From the tales (some of which are duly noted as apocryphal) of his youth to his battles with Congress and foreign powers and, of course, the showdown with South Carolina over tariffs during the Nullification Crisis, Remini manages to hit an ideal balance between surface details and analysis for a popular biography. And while Remini does act the apologist at times, he does little to sugarcoat some of Jackson's more unsavory ideas and traits. All in all, a solid, quick introduction to life of Jackson."
3,Interesting book.,We had to read this book in my AP U.S. History class. It is good. My theory on the reason why Remini wrote this book was to explain why Jackson did the things he did like the duels and make up for them. I never realized how interesting the presidents were espically Jackson. Good book to read.
2,Nice... But,"Nice ring good quality piece feels heavy not flimsy, for the price, but it lost its shine and luster 3 days out the package."
5,CAN'T-PUT-IT-DOWNABLE!,"THE GHOST NEXT DOOR allows the reader an exciting peek at real life ghost encounters of everyday people.As a ghost writer myself, (COAST TO COAST GHOSTS), I read with a critical eye. When Mark Morris sent me a copy of his book I read it from cover to cover and wanted more!THE GHOST NEXT DOOR is filled with fascinating accounts of haunted places. A skilled writer, Mark Morris knows how to tell a story! He is climbing the charts at Amazon.com and the reason is obvious! He is fantastic!"
2,Quick read,"This book had a few good ghost stories, but they were all quick anecdotes. It wasn't scary, but I almost didn't read it after dark. It was a quick read on the kindle fire, but it had poor editing and punctuation."
4,Great easy read,I enjoyed this book as it was a collection of stories and experiences from one author. It was very easy to read even though there were some puntuation/capitalization errors.I enjoyed the thoughts the author had on each experience he wrote about.
1,Nice while it lasted,"I bought this March 2006. It is Dec 2006 and the mattress cover is torn on the sides all around the pad. I took great care in trying to prevent tears and washed it seperately, dried it low heat and still it is ripped.If you are going to get a basic mattress pad look for one that is a lot cheaper than this..now I have to replace mine and am debating wether to go for a really cheap one or an expensive pad risking that it will rip again.."
4,Worked well,Worked well for me when I was in a codependent recovery group. Would recommend it for other people going through the recovery of codependency.
2,historically inaccurate and misleading,"the author, though he has a PhD, has revealed that he is behind in historical critique of biblical characters he brings forward as helpful examples for women trying to leave 'the life' if they are involved in the sex industry. He brings out Mary Magdalene and says she was a redeemed prostitute. This is a myth, factually refuted in 1969, and this historical error is admitted to by the Catholic church, whose own Pope Gregory made the conflation of the several women in scripture into the slander. It was hard to read this 'encouragement' through a slanderous myth. What also must be considered with this myth: the woman is powerless, she needs a 'Magdalene deliverance' by a power broker, Jesus, to get her out. It seems that another power broker got her in - the pimp. Either way, she is powerless. The myth serves no cause for agency or consent. Rewrite, please."
2,We take NEW GUINEA,How may I obtain a BETTER THEN AVERAGE COPY OF THIS DVD. The copy I now have is a very bad copy with almost no video in many frames. Thanks for your help...L. Spradling
3,Revived interest,"This idiosyncratic look at mid-century Chicago sat on my parents' bookshelves in my childhood, with a slightly-tattered dust jacket. I had been told that it wouldn't interest me, and I suppose it didn't - if I ever looked at it, its pagan outlook would have puzzled me. It was one of many books discarded after their deaths. Only seven decades after it appeared on their shelves, in the midst of genealogical research, did I discover that Weimar Port was really Will Judy, my mother's cousin's husband. Though Judy's attitudes on social and racial issues were predictably and solidly white upper middle class, the book reveals a Chicago more varied, racier, more hedonistic than the one my parents exposed me to. An interesting view of the Midwest's biggest city when everything seemed to be just in its proper place."
1,If you read only one book on motorcycling . . .,"...this shouldn't be it. As a woman, I agree that someone ought to write a book about this subject, but Joans hasn't done it justice. She admits speaking with only one ""Biker Chick"" (author's caps) and nevertheless produces a whole slew of generalizations--based on what? Observation without interview doesn't make anthropology. Many premises are established (shakily) and then contradicted only pages later. Apparently she ""interviewed"" a bunch of her friends, threw together some poorly supported conclusions and wound up with this book. The scholarship is too poor to make it an academic work, and there aren't enough good stories to make it a general interest work. Save your money, or read The Perfect Vehicle instead."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased four of these molds to steam and store my English Plum Pudding. While the molds function fine, three of the four molds arrived with dings and dents in the lids. These molds are definitely not as nice or durable as some other ones on the market."
5,plum pudding etc. made easy,I am now relieved of the need to find a proper tin can and top it with tin foil and string so it can be steamed for brown bread or plum pudding. Hooray! It even washes easily.
1,Check the index before you buy.,"In my copy of this book and all the other copies I've seen, the index has the wrong page numbers, making the book virtually useless as a reference. Looks like a lapse in Wrox quality control."
4,Lucky for us its pretty good...,"This is a pretty good book...Good thing because its the only book I have found that covers scriptlets exclusively. My only complaint is that the book could have been shorter, but the author has a tendancy to be redundant.Other than that one minor complaint, good coverage and good examples. Mr. Esposito's writing style may not be my favorite, but he does definately know the material."
5,Settle for Beauty,"Engaging, delightful, thoughtful, insightful. You'll want to read J.D.'s poems over and over again."
4,4 courners,"you like to read differents things rigth!, so you have to find something that take your atention and that you wants to keep reading and reading.This book is about a guy who move to chicago and wants to make news friends.In a party he get kind of drunk and driving his car he kill a girl.The girl's mom wants him to make 4 wirligigs and place them in the courners of US. She wants that lea's spirit be around everywhere.Well I like this book, and i thing that can be a good idea if you choose it to read."
3,I hated writing the summary but its cool,"I had to read it for school but I thought it was an ok book. I didn't like Brent's attitude in the book though, acting like everything was over because that stupid girl Brianna yelled at him. If I was a boy, I would have just left and not KILLED myslef! I liked the book though, some of the characters were annoying though. I hate this author anyway but I guess that if it's good enough to win an award or whatever, it's good to read. I hated writing a summry though because it's so boring in the beginning. I HATE BRENT AND HIS GAY LITTLE FRIENDS!!!"
1,To Whirligig or Not to Whirligig,"To me this book was just a tad bit confusing. After i was finished i finally understood the format. I like the concept of it all, but it was just outright confusing to me."
5,A book to ponder.,"Though written and recommended for a younger audience, I feel high school and even college students may be more appreciative of the transformative nature of the book. After all, it focuses on a high school student traveling on his own around the country. Brent's experiences much more closely mirror that of the older teenager branching out toward the life of an adult than that of the younger student. High school English teachers looking for a book with substance that will not intimidate slower readers should consider Whirligig for a good character study. But most important is the message that our actions, large and small, good and bad, have a huge impact on others lives. It is also a book of hope and promise."
3,"If I read one more book about Whirligigs, I will scream","This is the second book about whirligigs I have had to read for school, after a book called MISSING MAY. MISSING MAY was a lot better. At least it had a halfway believable plot. What is also starting to get to me is books where people react to tragic death in un- lievable ways. This is another one of those. Read this novel only if you must. A book for grownups to tell kids to read, not a book for kids to like on their own."
3,good quality of prose,"The theme seems to be of redemption for a DUI manslaughterby a teenager who had a suicidal urge go wrong while drivingafter drinking at a party.The condition of his conviction is that he build whirligig sculpturesat the four ends of the USA during his summer vacation.The book is a rich upper class type of redemption/ punishment?A black kid from Harlem would spend maybe fives years of adult time in upstate New York prisons for the same offense?A chicano in California from LA might fair even worse?So even with the literary quality of the prose, the bookfails for me. Do we think that the black teen or the Mexican teen don't feel remorse or need redemption?Only the white kid whose parents are willing to pay qualifies?"
2,Whirligig,"I really didn't like this book it was really confusing and kind of boring. I thought that it would be a lot different than it is. The author really jumps from place to place and you have no clue what was going on. It has a really good theme and plot, but that authors writing syle wasn't what I really would put with this kind of theme/ book."
5,WOW What a great book,"I simply read this book for a class project along with 6 other books. this was the first one i read. I could not put it down. Just waiting to see who he would help with his next whirligig kept my fingers turning the pages. if you want to read about how someone reclaims their life and discovers who they are, this is the best book for you."
4,Whirligig Review,"When Brent Bishop goes to a party his expectations are sky high, his crush is going to be there, and the party is thrown by one of the schools most popular guys. But, instead of the party being a blast, it was a bust. Brent is humiliated, and leaves the party with intentions of killing himself, but instead of killing himself he kills a girl he doesn't even know. The girls mother doesn't want revenge though, she wants Brent to set up whirligigs up in the four corners of the US. Washington, California, Flordia, and Maine. On the trip, Brent learns how to make wonderful whirligigs, and he also learns a lot about himself. I think this book was wonderful. There's really no other word to describe it. It's a book you can just sit down with and read until you're finished without putting it down. I suggest that anyone that can read, read this book."
3,Great Book; Disappointing Performance,"I was hoping for a good rendition of the novel since I liked the way Paul Fleischman's novel Seedfolks was performed. However, I was disappointed. My students (and I agree) thought that the voice of the main character Brent just sounded too old and not like the character they imagined. Also, they thought he read too slow in many parts. I know it was meant to be dramatic, but it was a little much. Since this is the only option for this novel on cd, if you really need it, it's not a bad reading overall. Some of the other actors for the non-Brent chapters do a good job. Still, I wished the main character's voice had been better."
2,A Bit Depressing,"Brent Bishop is like most teenagers. He struggles daily trying to be ""popular."" He gets his chance to prove himself when he is allowed to go to ""cool guy Chaz's"" party. Unfortunately, his chance for popularity is ruined that night since he is humiliated in front of everyone by the girl he has a crush on. He leaves the party and his life changes forever. In the process of trying to kill himself, he kills an innocent 18-year-old girl. As punishment he is told to build whirligigs in her honor and place them in the four corners of the country so that her spirit can live on. In this process he learns that there is more to life than he ever imagined. I liked the book okay although it was somewhat depressing throughout until you reach the ending. It made me think about how trivial some things in life are. It also made me think about how the things you do effect many other peoples lives. I recommend this for people who want to read it by their interest in what I wrote above."
4,Why Whirligig is a great book,"Whirligig is a must-read for all ages. This book beautifully illustrates the way the world today works: Just like a whirligig! Every piece of the world, just like every piece of a whirligig, is nessescary for the whole world to properly function. This book uses real-life situations and characters we can all relate to. Brent's on-going adventure is very similar to the adventure of life we all go through. Whirligig is simply a masterpiece."
2,READ OR NOT TO READ....,"The book Whirligig is by Paul Fleischman. This book will start out a little dull, but it getsbetter. The theme is about a boy named Brent who is learning how to forgive himself andalso maturing a bit too. This book is a combination of mysterious and adventurous. It ismysterious because he meets so many different people, for example the book said, "" He'dnever met a Canadian before."" He wouldn't know if he was a good guy or an evil guy. ""The consequences will be real"" ""No one would go near him."" Who knows what he coulddo. Also could be adventurous because Brent visits different places on his journey. Forexample, "" Let people all over the country receive joy from her."" He meets so manypeople along the journey. All in all, it was between ok and bad because I couldn't stayfocused. It was confusing, boring, and dull. There are only two main things that occur inthe book and I think they should have added steps up to the event and after the event."
2,Whirligig,"Brent Bishop is a high school senior who has been through alot of drama in his high school that puts him under peer preasure that causes a very bad thing to happen to him.When brent went to a school party he had some beer and got into a skuful with a popular kid and was tottaly humiliated in front of half the seniors, this made that thought of suicide run through his head. On his was home he didnt know were he was going because he was new to the town being drunk in all, but his night was not over yet.On his way home he was in a bad accident killing a younge girl, lea. He was given a DUI and went to mediation. Thats it were he met lea's parents. They didnt want to sue or anything so his mom had one thing for him to do. she wanted him to put whirlgigs in four places of the united states. I think that thats all that i will say for now, i will let you read the rest."
4,Whirligig,"Paul Fleischman's Whirligig is a story that depicts a young adult's problems with not fitting in. Brent Bishop is humiliated at a party and tries to deliberately kill himself, but the only problem is he fails only to kill another lady by the name Lea. Her mother doesn't ask Brent of anything but to travel to the four corners of the United States and place one Whirligig at each corner in honor of Lea's name. He must travel to California, Maine, Florida, and Washington placing one Whirligig at each place to remind others of his incident. While traveling to the four corners of the United States Brent finally realizes life is worth living despite his actions in the beginning and he starts living life to the fullest. This book is worth reading, it shows how valuable life is, even though it may not seem it at times. It is definitely worth reading to make you appreciate life."
5,"Piece by Piece, A Beautiful Read","Brent Bishop can never fit in, so he tries to kill himself. Driving home from a party where he is totally humiliated, Brent deliberately crashes his car. He lives, but takes another's life. A young woman, Lea, dies in the accident, & her mother wants only one thing from Brent. He must build four whirligigs in Lea's likeness & place them in the four corners of the United States.Brent makes his whirligigs much like Paul Fleischman constructs his heartwarming novel. The story moves seamlessly back & forth between Brent's journey to piece his life together, & glimpses into the lives of the fragile people who encounter each whirligig. Their stories in each simple chapter build a satisfying & uplifting whole, just like Brent's creations. This tale of redemption & restoration is a thing of beauty that will bring any reader joy."
1,Warning - author/publisher selling same book twice!,"This book is the virtually identical to ""DCOM Networking With Visual J++"" from the same author and publisher. Both books are content-free and contain only vague discussions of general resource/development planning issues that have nothing to do with Java or CORBA."
1,Not good,"I looked over this book in the store. Seems to have absolutely nothing to do with Networking, CORBA or Java. Also, has anyone noticed that every book by this author has gotten terrible reviews ?"
3,Cost per pound-yikes,"When you calculated the cost per pound it seems ridiculous. You can build your own jerky mixes with the proper nitrates(must have to prevent bacterial ilnesses)for 1/8, the price. I use a slim Jim recipe off the net and people love it. Add extra pepper, garlic, hot sauce...wonderful. As a beginner ,I used this and several other brands but nothing beats a good homemade mix.I suggest that this product tastes OK but not awesome."
4,LOVE AT WORK IN PROGRESS...,"This cd is pretty good, but overall, I can make a much better Marvin Gaye ballad cd. With the focus primarily on the ""Vulnerable"" sessions, we get filler throughout with songs like ""Funk me"",and ""Falling in love again"". Don't get me wrong, these songs are good, and are prime Marvin, but they do not belong on this CD."
4,Motown..Motown...Motown...,"Why do they continue to dishonor this man's legacy? Anwyay, this compilation isn't horrible, nor is it great, but it's a nice little collection of Marvin's ""love"" songs! I specifically bought the CD for the song ""You Sure Love To Ball"" which is a stellar, stellar cut! And while I would prefer that Motown put together a serious slow jams CD by this beloved artist, I'll take this CD over a lot of the other garbage out there right now! A solid 4 Stars! It is afterall, My Dear, Mr. Gaye!"
2,Didn't work,Tried it twice and no luck at all. The gel never dried properly and it did little to make the crack disappear.
1,Poor Service-Cheaters,"It has been told that the book comes with a cd-Rom bu i did not recieve any CD. Cheaters, the time when i placed order i assume that the CD will be sent. I would give them 0 rating they dont deserve one."
3,health and fitness reader review,"I loved the original SuperFoods RX, have shared it with friends, and use it as my nutritional Bible. This follow-up book was disappointing to me as I thought there was a lot of repetition from the first book. I am pretty knowledgable when it comes to exercise, so I didn't glean anything profound from the book, but I do think it provides good information for the person who needs to be motivated to exercise. I thought the concept of ERA - the three-pronged exercise attack was helpful.Although, I think that Dr. Pratt is very knowledgable and passionate about nutrition, I don't feel that he adequately explains how to eat all the food that he recommends without gaining weight. (Healthy foods have calories, too)."
4,Tasty Tidbits,"What I really liked about this book is that it shows you how to incorporate the ""superfoods"" into your life in small everyday ways, in addition to complete recipes. If you're like me, you have lots of cookbooks and health books with recipes that sound good, but you hardly use. I don't want to make a complicated recipe every day. Pratt and Matthews show you how to introduce the health benefits of these foods into your kitchen and your life seamlessly, including simple food preparation tips and ""mini-recipes"" as well as more standard recipes. Things like: mix cinnamon and cocoa and sprinkle on fruit; or mix pomegranate juice with selzer and lemon for a refeshing antioxidant cocktail. Worth it."
2,SuperFoods HealthStyle,"I found it very annoying that virtually every sentence in this book begins with some variation of, ""A recent study shows....."" I did not get very much useful information from this book at all. I am skeptical of ""studies"" because I believe they tend to be slanted towards whomever sponsors them. The sponsors tend to garner the response that favors themselves. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,misinformation,"Though there are truths stated in this book, there is also a lot of misinformation. The claims are not backed up.Unfortunately, some of these ""superfoods"" are problematic for some people and might not be good for anybody for that matter. The author should do some research on the harmful effects of soy and low-fat diets."
4,I thought it was a good tool,"I really liked this book, I agree that it is no fluff, only the results of the survey with some info on how to choose your doctor and what to watch out for. I would recommend it if you are either trying to see if the doctor you have chosen is good at that proceedure or if you dont know where to start.With the cost of plastic surgery and the trauma of a bad job...... I say it is worth it becuase you cant do too much research.I visited 4 of the doctors listed and after doing even more research, I found the info listed to be right on.I had my surgery with one of the doctors and am very pleased:-)"
3,A wide variety,"What's unusual about this collection is the somewhat strange variety of types and ages of movies featured. You get some really old (1930s and 40s) films like ""A Face in the Fog"" and ""A Shot in the Dark"", then some newer (1970s) movies like ""Grave of the Vampire"" and ""Carnage"". Some of the older ones I would definitely not call horror- more like crime drama. It is fun to watch the old ones just to see what really old movies were like. Some of them, such as ""Bloody Pit of Horror"", are the kind of cheesy B-movie/ soft porn productions that are so silly they're fun.There's nothing really great here, but I'd say it's worth buying for the value and the fact that there are so many old, hard-to-find movies here."
5,"Movies you've likely never seen, worth watching...","I paid about twenty bucks for my set new, and I am glad I bought them, having alot of the other mill creek sets, I knew there was alot of 30's crime drama movies, of which alot of them are ""pre code"", the lame obscenity codes inacted about 1934 by bible thumpers, and though I haven't watched all the movies, there are some really interesting ones, like the 1932 ""The Thirteenth Guest"", a crime mystery, and some horror flicks, like ""Carnage"", etc.You get Bloody Pit of Horror, a fairly decent transfer seen on other mill creek sets, much better here than a St Claire Vision ""Horrorlicious"" 13 hours+ and nine movies set I received recently. So far I haven't found any problems with the discs, scanned through alot of them, a couple of the discs had a strange swirl look to the top of the dvd surface, but they played fine, I scanned through all those, and they are just fine."
2,Not as good as some other sets available from the publishers.,"I've picked up several ""50 movie packs"" and even the ""250 horror movie pack"" and have been very pleased, over all. This set, however, was rather rough. The movies are all really bad in just about every way imaginable. Unless you want bad B-Movie quality softcore lameness, go elsewhere for entertainment."
3,Bogeys and bandits,Mr Gant this is not one of your best books .Please get back to to the way you have been . those were the best.
2,This guy is a douche,I'm in Navy flight school and most of this guys information plays off of false stereo types of fighter pilots and out of date information about the FRS
5,Bogeys and Bandits is an excellent non-fiction book,"Bogeys and Bandits by Robert Gandt is without a doubt the best non-fiction book I have read. It follows a group of men and women right out of college going through flight school. It goes through each phase of training, and tells how each student did, what they did, and how their lives change going through training.The book is very detailed. In every page, there is such good elaboration that you can paint a picture in your mind of every scene. It tells how the pilot feels in the jet, and what their state of mind is. The book is not sugar-coated at all. It tells EVERYTHING. I recommend this book to anyone interested in flying a jet. But it probably should not be read by anyone under 11. The book contains many quotes, and many contain profanity. The book deserves five stars and 2 thumbs up. It's awesome!"
3,Pilot's are not writers...,"I looked forward to reading this book. I bought it used and it was recieved in perfect condition.It's short and entertaining, albeit disjointed, and scrambled. I was left desiring a more detailed description of the time spent becoming a Naval Aviator and less descriptions about their attitudes.I would not recommend this book for anyone who seeks information about becoming a Naval Aviator, a class I fall into."
1,Bogus Bogeys,"My impression of Gandt's book is that it isa simplistic and superficial portrayal of what isa potentially fascinating subject. The characters are superficial and stereotypical and the plot (if there is one), is very disjointed. If the San Diego Union Tribune's review is correct and Gandt took no notes and did no research to corroborate his facts, then this book should be fiction instead of non-fiction. I find it interesting that basically only the women pilots' names were changed. If Gandt and his sources are so ""unimpeachable"" and the facts are true and indisputable, then why would Gandt feel the need to change the names of the women? The book clearly demonstrates an agenda, the question is whether it is Gandt's agenda or the Navy's."
2,Not worth the money,"You can get better variety for cheaper. There are no vocals on this c.d. -- just the instrumentals, so its harder to follow along unless you know the song real well."
4,I LOVED IT,i loved it so much but theres more songs like that werent on here when ever my friend comes over we sing this i got this for my birthday and i had to do my homework when i got home from school and i didnt want to do it because i wanted to sing so i went in my room and i was singing the songs i loved it i was singing and singing and singing i love this if you think you want this you should get it its good! but if you dont like those songs you would probaly just fall in love with it when you start signing!
4,"yeah it's good,but hear this!!!","This cd is good,but listen to this cd:It's a cd I made,So You can't buy it1.Sara McLauchlan/Building A Mystery2.Good Riddance(time of your life)/Green Day3.Christina Aguilera/Genio Atrapdao4.Justin Timberlake/Senorita5.Orchestral/Victory March6.Christina AguileraWell,there's more to this cd.Well,buy this cd.I don't know.I don't own it.I thought you were talking about my cd!!"
1,This oil is HORRIBLE,"I have used this oil as of recent and it loses it's viscosity very quickly and becomes dirty just like the Valvoline conventional oil. This oil, like most all off the shelf ""full synthetic"" oils is comprised of cheapo conventional oil with additives. Valvoline has never manufactured a quality oil. On the same test vehicle, Castrol part synthetic high mileage oils remain clean for more than 5k miles. Heck, even the Wal Mart brand full synthetic oil holds it's viscosity and cleanliness FAR longer than the GARBAGE that Valvoline produces."
5,Good Stuff,"Big fan of getting my oil via Amazon subscribe and save. Setting the duration to 6 months is perfect for my change interval and it reminds me I need to change the oil when it arrives.Regarding the oil itself, benchmarks shows that Valvoline Syn is one of the better mass oils you can get. I've never had an issue with it and change it every 7k on my turbo car and 10k on my regular gas car. I've done oil analysis at these intervals several times and things look great."
4,Used in 2005 Subaru Legacy GT,"I had been previously using the highest-end Penzoil (bought from Wal-Mart in the big jugs). I decided to try Valvoline, having used the regular oil in an old car of mine for years (that I know is still running strong). I noticed (though it could be just imagining things) a notable increase in acceleration smoothness, less arduous starts with no turbo noise, and a smoother idle. Again, this could all be a figment of my imagination, but I'm sticking with this product (especially since it's a fair-ish price). I'd use Mobil 1 but I've been told Mobil 1 is a no-go in boxer engines. Don't know why."
3,Amazon Great - Valvoline Website Misleading,"Probably a very good oil for gas engines. But, after much study on Valvoline misleading website, I expected it to carry MB 229.51 and VW 505.01 specs for VW and MB diesels. Had to return. But, great service from Amazon."
3,Entertaining,"Harvey gave a much better performance in this show than in Original Kings. I didn't think he was that funny but his performance gave me a few chuckles, no bellyache but a few chuckles nonetheless. What impressed me about this DVD was that there are two performances, both of which were good. His jokes on various famous crimes and the African jungle were nuff funny. All in all a good DVD to have to perk you up on a dull weekday evening. Oh and I definitely rate it better than Cedric's Starting Line-up 1."
3,Entertaining,"The One Man show was entertainng throughout, but it did not make me roll around with laughter. Steve Harvey is a funny man and can be quite theatrical at times. He repeated a lot of the jokes he had done on Def Jam, although he did change them a bit. His Def Jam performances were more convincing.On the whole I would rate this above average, but only just."
1,Don't You Just Hate This Guy?,"His face? His hair? His smile? On top of that, he isn't even funny. I can't stand this Steve Harvey guy. Don't know how he ever got a show... oh yea, it was on UPN."
5,Former dancer,"I was trained in the Balanchine technique, and although interpretations vary on what Balanchine wanted from his dancers, this book is a must have for dancers, teachers and ballet fans in general. Suki was one of the original Balanchine dancers, and it is wonderful that she put forth the effort to carry on his methods of technique and training."
2,Nice toy but,"It seems that this toy is a lot of fun. My son received it as a gift from our Pastor. However, when my husband went to put it together, one of the smaller parts was missing from the box. I called the company and was told this model is discontinued and the company who carries this went out of business. I know it's from Parents' Magazine/Battat so I was a little confused. The representative couldn't even offer a solution as to what to do. Hoping that the hardware store will have this part. By the time we find the part, my son will probably have outgrown it, as he is tall for his age."
3,Cute but not as sturdy as it looks,"We loved the cute colors and the all wood construction. Very retro and pretty. However, once assembled, the trike is not as sturdy as we would have liked. It's rickety although it has never fallen apart. This product also needs a pushbar to allow parents to guide the toddler along. It's very exhausting to bend down and push the trike."
4,good movie,I like this movie its verry funny I first saw it on TV its a good movie I dont have the dvd yet so if anyone has it. If you can tell me if the bonuse episode of jimmy when he and cindy get stuck on a island I think the name of the episode is called stranded.You can let me know by posting a review by the dvd thanks.
1,Stupidest conclusion in history,Just incredibly stupid there was not one funny joke in the whole crossover. The ending to the trilogy still left things unanswered. I am not going to scare fans of Jimmy Nuetron well I am the show is rumored to have been cancelled after the last power hour. The villian was stupid and was absoultley intended to have been evil. and something about the future and now I am lost DUMB!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Friends are forever,"I think this book was o.k. I like it because it's about friends, but I don't like it cause it dosen't have very much action. It's about a girl that hardly ever gets to see her father. If you like boks about friends you will lkie this book."
2,in country 1986,"I was stationed in Subic bay philippines from 1984-1987. I was there during the gate strike. the skilled workers from Ship Repair Faciility blocked all the gates to the base. I had to have my wife and kids come on to the base so they could be safe. I worked port and starboard watches at port opreations subic bay meaning 12 on 12 off. I was there when the Commanding Officer naval station subic bay escorted mr. marcos to cubi naval air station to fly to hawaii. so to me this movie means a lot. 6 years later the base in subic was closed. it was unique to be there for a part of history. marcos was a mean man who did what he could to cheat at the elections. his wife as you will see in the movie had just as much power as he. I have been married to a filipina since 1981 for us this movie means a lot. we were a part of naval history.LON K. HE'BERT, RM2(SW), USN, RET"
4,Good movie with history behind it,"Movie arrived in good condition. Ordering on Amazon is always easy. Story has personal meaning to my husband. Finally got it in our library. People give bad reviews about the acting, etc., but it was based on a documentary and wasn't meant to be an Academy award winner! It's just an important story about dictatorship and courage!"
4,Concise and Useful,"I have been managing projects and teaching project management for more than thirteen years; in that time I have run across two resources I reference often in my training, this is one of them. I suggest this resource for two reasons: first, because it is concise and to the point, secondarily it is a fresh presentation of useful PM knowledge. Too many PM books are full of ""fluff"" and impractical information. If this book offered new or original dynamics it would easily be a five; as such any new project manager will find it a jewel. When I wrote my own book, I used Penner's presentation style as a model, keeping it concise and practical for everyday use.The founder of charlesspeaks.com and author of five books I highly recommend Penner's work."
3,football square,"The display is a little too high, about 1/8 to 3/16 inch, does not fit tight so ball will not stand straight. I have 7 balls, 3 differant brands, and only 1 fit right."
2,Have to modify it,It arrived pretty nice but autographed style football rolls around inside it. I guess the special autographed balls are slightly smaller because other football did fit. We are adding extra plexiglass so it fits snugly.
2,cheap,"I ordered this to go with an autographed football for my fiance's birthday. It's very cheaply made and doesn't even hold the football in place. I will be getting him another case. This one may be good for a younger child that you don't want to give a glass case to, but for a nice gift or one that you really want to display, skip this one."
2,Cute but squeaky!,"These sandals are very cute, but unfortunately very squeaky. This is a peculiar and embarrassing defect. The sandal sole and pad is made of plastic (I am unsure what material the thong is made of) and for some reason it squeaks when I walk - this may be a problem peculiar to my pair, but it is enough to keep me out of them. When you aren't moving they look great."
1,BEWARE- DO NOT BUY!,"This product is a complete messup from Amazon. I ordered it for my hubbie for Christmas and I received only 1 PENCIL! I sent it back to Amazon and they supposedly sent me a replacement, again receiving only 1 PENCIL!!!! I have received no reimbursement, and Amazon has admitted it must be their defect with this product. Do not buy! I am a long time Amazon customer, but am so frustrated wtih Amazon's customer service in returning this defective item!!!"
1,Agree that you should NOT buy,"Like the previous reviewer, we had the same problem. Only one pencil arrived. We returned it but the replacement also had only one pencil. Amazon has admitted a wide spread problem with this product yet we see it is still offered for sale. So we are writing this to warn others to avoid the headache and look elsewhere."
