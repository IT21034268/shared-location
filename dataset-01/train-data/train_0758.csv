2,Not at all what it was hyped to be,"According to many of the reviews I read the film was ""better than Momento,"" which turned out to be false. Though the camera work was somewhat original it was over done and really not necessary. The story was far too obvious and many of the ""great"" scenes went on long past what was needed. This movie should never be compared with Momento, they're completely different movies meant for completely different audiences, and I am not that audience."
4,Could have had more substance,"The filming, although made most people nauscious, was pretty well done. The violence was well done, and acting very natural. I can't say I would add this to my collection, because I don't think I would want to watch the rape scene again. Mr Noe, did a great job by making a disgusting film and I know that he intended it to be like that. So congrats. The rape scene had to be that long, since they were trying to be natural. I liked, the sweethereafter of the film, towards the end, when the main characters are interacting and they don't know what's coming. But we do. That's the saddest."
1,You will feel as if you have been slimed,This is exploitation cinema masquerading as art. Warning: Taking multiple showers every day for the next several decades will not rid you of the effects of having seen this film. I believe that those who rate it highly are both depraved and gullible.
1,Too Bad It's Irreversible,"I rented this movie before reading the reviews and that was a big mistake. Can't say how disappointed I was. It's so awful, it needs a whole different rating system. This thing deserves a negative 5.I now have but one problem: how to get my mind rid of the memory of this movie. If only I could reverse the clock and skip renting it!"
1,I Guess I'm Old Fashioned,"Because I like my movies to have a beginning, a middle, and an end...IN THAT ORDER!!! I also prefer to have stomach turning experiences at an amusement park and not in front of my television. The nausea I refer to was not caused by either of the violent scenes which are the core of this movie. I developed motion sickness due to the spinning, twisting, rolling camera shots. The movie is gimmick laden and all of the tricks failed to impress me.The final scenes, which of course appear near the beginning, would have been far more satisfying had we been aware of the cause.No, no, a thousand times NO...No more backward movies. It's cute, it's ""artistic"", and it's STUPID. STOP IT! And the camera work...No more shaky shots. And god please, no more tumbling scenes. Miss this movie if you can."
1,Don't waste your time. Save your money.,A complete waste of time. The direction was poorly different and the violence and obscenities were totally unnecessary. Made me sick literally. I don't know who would find this movie worthwhile. Even my poor review here is better than the movie!
3,Monica Bellucci is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in hollywood,"I don't like the movie, but I like Monica Bellucci, she is very beautiful and her body is the goddess."
1,Horrible,"Just horrible. Stopped watching. Bought this because I thought it would be artsy, but it was wasn't. What I watched was just really bad."
1,I'd sooner watch porn than this.,"The movie made an impression like it had no director at all, and they had a drunken cameraman. I'd sooner watch porn than this completely screwed up crap."
1,Truly awful,I love movies and almost never hate one. I hated this movie. The camerawork at the start of the movie almost gave me motion sickness. The story was violent and boring at the same time- not an easy feat. I truly cannot understand the good reviews it received.
1,Ridiculous,"This movie was a complete waste of time. It's not erotic, artistic, or thought provoking. It's an excuse for gratuitous violence. It makes no point, and fails in every way except to offend."
3,Not For the Squeamish,"""Irreversible"" is a very difficult film to watch. For starters, the jerky hand-held shooting of the first reel is a test of your stomach. It's as violent as it is dizzying. If you can survive this portion of the film, you'll be able to endure the rest. If you manage to do that, you'll witness a truly unique film experience.Told in reverse chronological order, its similarity to ""Memento"" stops there. Here it works extremely well -- definitely more than a gimmick. It works so well in fact that if ""Irreversible"" were told in standard order, the film would be very unsatifying.In addition to the opening, the film features a graphic rape scene that effectively shows its brutality.Overall, ""Irreversible"" is a great film for someone that wants to see something that is really different. However, it is so harrowing and brutal, that you probably will not want to see it a second time. You've been warned."
2,Brutal Mess of a Movie,"Plot- A woman gets beat and raped by a man after witnessing a fight between him and a prostitute. The womans boyfriend goes to get revenge on the guy who did it.Sounds simple enough?... well, not really. The whole movie is in reverse and if you thought Blair Witch was bad with the shakey cameras stay far away from this one. Even if you didn't think it was bad, this will make you dizzy. I don't know why the director kept filming scenes and making it look like the camera was going in circles but it did not help the movie.If you like violence you'll love this movie. If you like to hear people talk about sex, party, and portray violence against women you'll love it. If you're looking for a good revenge story you may like it but I expect a lot more from a film than just that."
1,Misery incarnate,"The only good thing about this movie is the way it was shot. The trick camera work is this film's best asset. The retribution scene at the Rectum is not really that big of a deal. The thing which makes this movie intollerable is the long and horrible rape scene. I think this is the most horrible thing I have ever seen in a movie. This scene makes the rape in I Spit On Your Grave seem timid by comparison. (Even the notorious razor-blade rape in the Stendahl Syndrome is comparitively tame.) Many people were disturbed by the rapes in Blue Velvet and The Accused; the latter are G-rated compared to this irresponsibly long, realistic, and sickening (simulated) sexual assault. I'm sure the real sickos out there would probably get off on this one."
1,This film will make you want to throw up!,"I have never felt ill after watching a movie until i watched this film. Between the horrrific violence of the rape scene and the head bashing in the gay S&M club, i actually felt violated for watching it. The film seemed more like a snuff film then anything else. There was no need to make it, and no need for us to watch it. I don't believe all films should be touchy feely feel good crap (though those films have there place), but this pushed the limit to an unimaginable point. If you buy this or rent it, be prepared to feel sick (if you have a conscience). Avoid this if you have a weak stomach at all."
2,Did nothing for me,"I'll make this short and simple. I was intrigued by the polar reviews, some praised the movie for understated direction some hated the nonstop swirling of the camera. As a victim of rape I thought this movie would invoke some emotion, isn't that what a good movie is about. But for the first 25 minutes all I could make out was my reflection on the computer screen and the subtitles. The rape scene left me laughing, so obvious that this is coming from a male's point of direction. So pitiful and delicate, I swear I was watching an anime. I felt nothing for the victim (Alex) and by the time she had her head bashed in I was thinking ""Well that's what happens when you just lay there"". I guess I was expecting something more therapeutic, something more real. Yes it was raw and will make people uncomfortable, which seems to be the linear goal of this movie; but, and I stress this, it wasn't authentic."
4,Need a strong stomach,This movie was definitely disturbing. It's not for the faint at heart. The acting was superb and the reversal of events was a clever twist. It gave the viewer one surprise after another.
2,"Entirely ""too over done!""","This movie wasted at least ""45 minutes"" of unfocused, extended scenes of which half took place in just the running of the credits at the ""beginning"". The best I can say for it was at the end (which was reallly the beginning scene) when I realized it was finished and that the actual story line was rather good and the qenuine novel idea of completely ""reversing"" the order of the scenes was very good. But even for the nominal cost of viewing this movie I don't think the torturously long ""times"" of extended darkness, shadowed actors, rotating, and skewed camera angles were at all called for or worth it!"
1,Pretentious Trash,"Right up there with Doom Generation for Worst Film I've Ever Seen. Don't waste your time. It begins with an eye-assaulting piece of camera work that is meant to evoke an adrenaline-fueled confrontation, but only serves to annoy the viewer. Cutting an insipid film into reverse chronological order makes this a one-trick-pony."
1,Not Good,I didn't like it. It was too graphic and I couldn't get through the movie. I guess it wasn't for me.
1,you want blood...?,"i will try and waste as few words as possible on this review.poor pretentious technique.poor uninspired dialouge.poor one note acting.aestheticlly vacant.hypocritical expolitation-oriented sex and violence (obviously digitally manipulated)arrogant, smug and unreasonablely nasty to its intended viewers.want to feel sick to your stomach and disturbed without any logic other than to feed the ego of yet another french manipulator of art? if not i would suggest watching ""audition"" instead; a film with equally realistic violence, but also bearing an aethetic sensabilty, honesty and respect for those who would turn to horror as entertainment."
2,Meh,"This movie definitely did not live up to its hype. Gimmicky plot devices, very unlikable characters. Enter the Void was amazing, though."
1,you know what it's about.,"This movie is about rape. A very graphic rape happens in the movie and then there are a bunch of long, drawn out scenes that will put most to sleep. If you can handle all that, you might like it. I know they were trying to be shocking or whatever. but it was just contrived and boring. Just an opinion. I wouldn't pay $20 for it."
1,WARNING,i reccomend this film for its intelligence. i loved the way the plot is set up and the camera work is terrific. The acting was also impecible.However i do not think this film has enough warning on it about the type of scences the viewers encounters.DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IF YOU ARE IN ANYWAY SENSITIVE TO RAPE !! it has posible one of the worst rape scetches i have ever seen. The violence is extremely realistic and i am not a squimish person but i felt physically sick on several occasions. Horrific doesnt even cover it and the infomation on the back i think downplays how brutal the film is.nothing is left to the imagination.if i was going to praise this film for anything it would be how it reveals just how much we fool ourselves into thinking we are civilised creatures and how close to instinct driven predators we really are.
1,one star because I can't give zero,"A piece of dung in an artistic package is still a piece of dung. This was the most SICKENING work of cinema I've ever seen. Unless you find enjoyment in watching a rape scene in which a man forces violent anal sex on a weeping woman at knife-point, I urge you to steer clear of this one. I'm not talking a slit-second visual flash to let you know what's happening ala Pulp Fiction, but several excrutiating minutes (felt like an eternity) of uninterrupted, graphic rape followed by beating - great, guys. An afficionado of foreign and art films (even 'tastefully violent' ones), I went to see this movie without knowing the nausea I was in store for. Don't make the mistake I did - stay away."
1,Repugnant Rubbish,"Just when you thought the French couldn't sink any lower along comes Irreversible. Told in reverse this film is essentially a tale of revenge however unlike other films in this genre this film lacks any class and goes straight for the juggular. Whilst much of the debate over this film surrounds the infamous 10minute rape sequence, an act of violence towards the start of the film is perhaps the most violent and reprehensible scene ever committed to celluloid. Stobe lights and crazy camera movements drive the viewer to reach for the sick bag rather than be dazzled by the director's attempts at stylistic meaning and the main characters are all shallow, unlikeable people. This film is an ugly and pretentious attempt at displaying the darker side of human nature and the concepts of fate and time however ends up wallowing in its own sordid mess losing any messages it was trying to make in the process. Watch for a curiosity or shock piece only."
2,Disappointing Direction,The camera is so shaky and flows a random pattern of movement. It is not on the subject thats saying the dialogues...
1,"Disturbing, grimy, annoying videography",The rape scene was unnecessarily long and very disturbing. Had to fast forward through it. The movie never redeemed itself. Videography was annoying - camera was all over the place. I don't care what the artistic point of this movie was. It was awful!
1,I Don't Know What To Say About This One,"I get what the director was trying to do with this film. The cinematography, editing and acting are all top notch. The sense of place is very real and immediate. BUT...This is not entertainment. Art? Maybe. I love a dark/disturbing movie just as much as the next guy/girl. But this film is sick and twisted (the rape scene goes on way too long). Unecessary. We get the point after the first minute or two...I don't know...I guess this is either one of the most daring films to be made in the last few years or one of the worst. Shouldn't a movie be something you want to view again though? This is definitely not one of those movies. If it helps from a critic standpoint I love Blue Velvet, Requiem for a Dream, Heavenly Creatures...But this one is...I don't know.... rent first...Do not buy this without having seen it first."
1,"The Movie Should be called, ""Terrible!""","I have seen many movies, and have enjoyed many of them; however this is by far the worst film. First, the movie starts from backwards to forwards, similiar to Momento. In the beginning of the movie, the camera work could make anyone dizzy. The worst part of the film without question was the rape scene. This is the longest rape scene (about 10 minutes) that I have ever seen and it was very brutal. Lastly, I have been going to movie theatres for a long time, but I never experienced a reaction from moviegoers as was the case here. Halfway through the film, most of the people in the theatre left! It was incredible to see people walk out of the theartre, all of whom were very upset about the contents of the movie."
2,Pretentious,"If you like spinning camera effects for no other reason than to seem artistic, you'll love this movie. This movie is most famous for it's very realistic RAPE scene and the reverse order of the presentation of the movie. Other than watching this one for the very well performed ( disturbingly so) graphic scene, there's not much of a reason to slog through this film."
4,Shock value..,"This hype surrounding this movie was justified. The two major scenes were as graphic as advertised. So, if you have a weak stomach I would advise that you not purchase this flick. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone who is unphased by graphic violence in cinema."
3,Some horrific scenes,Purchsed this through an online recommendation. It is hard to follow as it is written in revers order with each scene explaining the scene prior to it.
2,Irreversible - don't waste your time.,A brutal depiction of violent rape and a discombobulated story. Hard to follow. I found it difficult to sympathize with any of the characters in this movie.
2,"Trying too hard to be artistic, and the story is rather flat","Some people like the artistic elements in this movie, some don't. I don't think it's very innovative to constantly spin the camera or to have the film in reversed sequence...seen that all before. Surely, it's technically well done but also makes it kind of exhausting to watch.What bothers me most is the story: I have nothing about very explicit movies, but there needs to be a reason for that. Just showing how wrong and bad people can be is not deep, it's nothing new... and this is the biggest problem I had with this movie: it tries to be really deep and unraveling, but the story really isn't. Nothing I learned, and since baise-moi rape scenes are (for the better or worse) not that surprising anymore.Monica Belluci plays well, I'd have loved to see here as a character with more complexity."
2,not bad not good,"i decided to give the movie a chance and watched it..don't like the fact its presented backwards..i couldn't stand the spinning camera view..at one point i'm asking myself what the hell is happening..those graphic scenes were really well made and a bit realistic witch grabbed my attention..the rape scene did go on a bit to long but i could feel the desperation and terror she must of felt..so the death scene,the rape scene,and the beautiful Monica Bellucci naked are the only strong points in the movie..so all in all for me it was not a bad movie but also not a well made movie..did i mention the spinning camera? yeah that was horrible"
3,It's a shame it's 10 minutes too long.,"It fell short of excellent filmmaking due to the rape scene and the Rectum scene - both could have been cut in half. For instance, I didn't need to see Monica Belluci raped for 9 minutes - the scene could have been accomplished in half that time. The scene goes from shocking to just plain boring. As for the Rectum, the search for Le Tenia just took too damn long, followed by the extensive head bashing. VERY frustrating for me, as I did enjoy the film but wish it could be re-edited.The story itself was nothing extraordinary, it was simply told in reverse. The way in which it is visually presented, however, makes for a good film."
3,Tough to Watch,"Good story, albeit told backwards, two extremely violent scenes, one very cool, one (the rape scene) not exactly a pleasant view, and dizzying and sometimes nonsensical camera work, make for an interesting movie. Not great, but interesting."
2,Don't bother,"Not good. Camera work is awful and gives you a headache...constantly shaking. The first half hour you can't even see what's going on and the subtitles are hard to read. The show has a good story idea, but played out very poorly."
2,"Different, yes...","WARNING: SPOILERS. Opening scene is quite shocking. Some graphic effects. There is more male nudity and male genitalia than female. There is only one quick...very quick female genitalia shot near the beginning, or ""end"" of the movie. Since the movie begins with the ""ending scene"" and ends with the ""opening scene"". The rape scene is violent, and intense. Not even a good boob shot.Movie is revenge driven...and that seems to be about it. Doesn't have a great script...may be good to the French...but, not to US standards."
1,SELF-INDULGENT TO THE DEGREE OF BEING IDIOTIC,"Let me call the bluff on these emperor's clothes: once you strip this supposed art house tosh of its longer-than-necessary ""art porn"" scenes and other sundry pretentions, there really is very little left in its average revenge story.There's graphic intensity, and then there's graphic exploitation. Irreversible (which as a lame play on words is told in a reverse chronological order) almost always teeters on the brink of the latter, shocking for the sake of shocking, gory for the sake of being gory.If voyeuristic fireworks is what you're after, at least real porn maintains the honesty of not hiding its true identity behind an artistic veneer. I regret that the colossal waste of time on this idiotic film is indeed irreversible."
1,don't believe the hype,"Two scenes: a murder, and a rape. Yes they both are really graphic, but it's not what turned me off. I just found the movie to be extremely boring. It's well made, well acted (dupontel was fine, vincent cassel was good, as usual). But my god...after the rape scene I had the urge to fast forward the movie. The film is flat, offers nothing interresting. I don't see what Gaspar Noe was trying to show. It all looks like a very nice marketing experiment. Don't believe the hype..."
2,Hodge Podge,"The movie starts at the end and goes backwards. Its like an art film but NOT a horror movie!It has a couple violent scenes in it, including a disturbing rape scene but this movie is not scary at all.The camera work made me dizzy, and was done for effect. If you are looking for a violent movie about revenge, check out the ""I spit on your Grave"" remake starring Sarah Butler. ""Irreversible"" is a hodge podge of visual images that attempts to turn rape and revenge into artistic cinematic statements. It doesn't have much of a plot and there is no character development. This movie might have gotten a 3 star rating or better if it had a cohesive plot. It isn't total trash but I didn't enjoy it."
3,Starts at the most shockingly brutal and ends in a sunny park...,"The film is end to beginning; two extremely violent scenes, one involving a brutal rape; and then the film just continues backward to the beginning of three ordinary peoples lives. Watch at your own risk."
1,"sex and violence exploitation, thats it","This film was only made for exploitation and shock value. I see no entertainment value in this movie. I wish I never watched it. There is no character development, not much of a plot. The only reason this film received praise is because it's French which automatically puts in the artsy category. Vincent is a great actor but he's wasted in this mess. After watching this film the only things you will remember are the brutal rape and violence scenes. To prove that, in the DVD extras all the director talks about are the rape and violence scenes, he could careless about actor interviews or any other insights about the film."
1,Sweet Baby Jesus,"Well, that sucked.If you're prone to motion sickness don't watch this film.If you're homophobic don't watch this film.If you value your time don't watch this film."
1,too violent,"too violent and difficut to follow.only watched 1/2 the film, and had to shut it off at the rape scene."
1,horrible,horrible. turned off after 30 minutes. what the heck do folks see in this. stupid effects. whats the point of the dizzying moving? i want my money back
1,Sick movie,With all the violence and depravity in this world why would someone want to make a disgusting film like this. This film just adds to it.Spend your time doing something positive and productive rather than watching this sick film.
1,"Not ""watchable"" due to annoying filming technique",I could not get past the first 30 minutes of this movie. I kept waiting for the camera to level off and stop spinning but it never did. This is not my idea of a movie. Don't waste your time on this one.
2,What else?,"I love movies. Believe me.And I'm not the type ""love story & happy ending"" reviewer.I heard this movie was very raw, violent and a lot of things. And it is. But the story is poor, very poor. There's a very good performance -the main man- and nothing else.The director seems to be a ""marketing oriented one"": all the time the images on the screen seems shout: look how bad is the human nature, look the limits, look this violence, look how raw is this movie, guau...more violence. If you really want a disturbed movie BUT with a story, a truly director behind and without all this talent-less images, look for ""Requiem for a dream"": this is a movie, not like this garbage.Forget about it."
1,Hideous,"I am sure this movie is very ""artsy"". I am just not able to comprehend its greatness.It is very hard to tell what is going on because of the spastic camera, spinning and focusing on the ceiling, then the floor, then the actor (almost) then the wall, etc. ad nauseam. Maybe this is a good film but I couldn't tell you because the camera work makes it incomprehensible. The spinning camera trick does mostly stop after 1/2 hour, but I decided at that point if I should watch the rest of the movie. It is full of allot of nauseating violence and gay sex. I couldn't see wasting more time on it, so I stopped watching."
1,Garbage,"Unless you enjoy watching a woman being raped and beaten for 10 or more minutes, this is not the movie for you. Clearly this is one of the directors that hates women. And why this actress agreed to be degraded in this way is beyond me."
3,I really don't know how to rate this movie...,"Well, I was disturbed. I did have to watch this movie twice to fully understand, i watched it like it plays for the first time through, then I programmed the chapters backwards in my DVD player to watch it 'in reverse'. I skipped the rape scene 2nd time around b/c I cried the first time. I just don't know what to say about this movie, except that I don't really think it is exploitation, but it is horrifying and it is something that happens everyday to innocent people. This is an important movie for that fact alone. The scene of revenge really makes me angry because thst guy was not the rapist, the rapist was standing next to the guy who got his head bashed in. Explicit sex, yes, some places have brief glimpses of sex, but thank God the rape scene was just simulated. If you have ever experienced the horror of rape, do not watch this film."
3,Does it work,"It's okay, does its work. Good for plugs behind the furniture, and i like how the cord is short. Makes it much easier to manage the wires.Wish there were more outlets though."
5,As advertised,It is hard to go wrong with an extension cord. One third of the cost of Lowes and works perfectly.
4,3ft cord hard to find.,I looked at many stores (hardware etc.) No 3 ft cords to be found. Bought this one. Price too high but had no other choice. What's to say about a cord. It works! Should be a 3 prong plug instead of just 2.
4,Behind fireplace,I bought the cords so that they would fit behind my fire place gas. so far haven't electrifide nothin still work so all is good
1,Not a 3-pronged plug,Any devices with a ground (3-pronged plug) can't be used with this. It would have been helpful if the Amazon description or images showed this.
1,"says ""2 wires"" but only 1 for $6",when i ordered this item i was expecting 2 wires 3 foot each instead i got 1 wire that was double the price at lowes.
3,Could be flatter and thinner,"Despite being only 2-prong instead of 3-prong, this plug is actually thicker than the competing ""Flatplug,"" though it did come out slightly thinner than the Coleman Cable brand's product. For reference, this plug measured in at .56"" whereas the Flatplug was just .44""."
3,Not Quite Perfect,"I was really happy to see that this soundtrack was released. It is well done. Unfortunately, it is missing the one track that I wanted the most. In the mini-series, it is the track played near the beginning of the second episode, as the ships of colonists are headed toward Mars. Yet, there is a piece on the disk titled, ""Silver Locusts"". But, it is not the same one. If I had known that my favorite track was missing, I may have even reconsidered my purchase."
3,the daredoll dilemmas greatest perils vol 23,the woman were hot in thier costums.the one thing i was thinking draged to much of the time.it would have been nice if the pace pick up.
1,"Nice idea, but broke easily","I really liked this device at first, because it held the pen at the angle my hand specialist said would relieve my pain. And it did. But the part that holds the pen is small - the smallest pen I have stresses it, and it broke today - about two weeks after I bought it. The other sizes aren't useful at because they either won't fit on my fingers or won't stay on. Unless you have a really thin pen or just need a short-term solution, I wouldn't recommend buying this product."
2,Easily broke.,"It's a great concept...and if you don't put a slightly too-big pen/pencil in it, it works great! Unfortunately, it does not withstand much pressure and the pencil-grip piece broke in the first week. If you never plan on stressing it, it'll work great. It holds the pen in a great position; a fairly ""normal' position. The company did offer to send an immediate replacement, however."
5,Excellent Book -- but much cheaper elsewhere online,"I won't write much since I would only echo what other reviewers have said -- John Sells has put together an excellent book. Thoroughly researched, well written, and the extensive index makes it invaluable for quick reference.However, I'm very confused about this listing. Unante 2nd edition is available new at several other online stores new for a much lower price. There isn't any indication that this is specially signed or different in any way so I don't understand the price difference."
2,Dissapointing trees!,"This was a dissapointing purchase. I am an intermediate and I really thought this could help me out a little by advancing some of my skills, but it didn't. The only thing I learned was how to really glaze, because that's all she does is glaze. She paints 3 trees, a sky and whatever else by glazing everything. It's not that bad, but it's not good either. I've bought many other tapes/dvds and this is by far my least favorite."
5,just what I was looking for,Does all that I need it to in a machine shop - a coworker bought one from a store and paid over $40 more!
4,use it every day and love it...,took it a step further and attended a JLC class to learn the full functions of the calculator and have loved it even more since. Instructions are good but not great...thats why 4 stars...but it is learn able and the quick reference and strong build hold up to the job site...consider there tutor workbook available from there site.
1,you get what you pay for,"I wasn't going to review this item, but this is the second email I have been sent to review it.I used this product one time, it broke and it is now in the garbage. It didn't work, just made a mess.If I want to make Spaetzle I will need to get a real maker, like my mother in law."
5,Pure Bliss!,"Rainbeau Mars is a wonderful teacher. And i love this tape of hers! She really makes you sweat, and is so kind and gentle about doing it to. Not only do you get an amzing workout but you get to see hawaii in all its beauty!"
2,Yoga Rainbeau Mars,"Similar to ""Pure power"",too simple, too short and not really a flowing sequence . The cover here algo has NOTHING to do with the actual practice.Plus I didn't almost sweat at all...For power yoga I recommend Bryan Kest Power Yoga Complete Collection, Baron Bapstiste Live Clases, Rodney Yee Total Body Workout and Kristen McGee Power Yoga."
1,"Nikon L3 - great outside, lousy inside",Wow Nikon missed the mark with this one. The menu is just crazy - feels like a marketing guy on steroids put every conceivable ridiculous feature imaginable into this camera. The flash is worthless.Buy this camera only if;1) your shots tend to be outdoor action shots where no flash is ever needed2) you can get it for $50 or less
1,Disposable cameras take better pictures!!! Really!,"After several years of use with this camera I can honestly say that its the biggest piece of crap I've ever owned!!! If you are taking outdoor pictures in sunglight, it's fine, but indoors...FORGET IT!! Too dark and very blurry. The flash is useless!You are better off with a disposable than this."
2,Good for outdoor pictures,"Nikon L3 Highs*Sharp, colorful outdoor picturesNikon L3 Lows*Battery life is horrible, I had to switch to Energizer E squared to fix this*Focusing takes roughly four seconds*Flash photography leaves foreground overexposed and background underexposed, even after I adjusted the stops."
2,I really wanted to like this camera!!,"Likes:1. Nice saturated color (kind of over exag. but I like that)when camera does get a good shot2. good for outdoor great light shots BUT.....3. Use of AA Batteries and Life is pretty decent.4. Size of CameraMajor Dislikes:1. Very hard to get any shots without major blur.2. FORGET using this camera inside. The flash is horrible. Please don't bother with this camera inside. You will be very dissappointed. There is so much noise on indoor pictures.3. I have taken close to 600 pictures at the highest quality allowed on the camera. Of the 293 that turned out, the mega pixels never exceeded 2.29 mega pixels.4. Forget Cropping with this camera."
2,Just ok,"I bought this camera a long time ago year 2006, and i was very happy at first bec. it was very easy to use and does a great job. But just after using less than a year, it's getting really bad. It takes blurry pictures and lights were so bad. I don't even use it all the time, and now after 6 years, mine has finally retiring. The original battery does not work and i boughtnew disposable and rechargable batteries but still doesn't work anymore. For the sale price of $99 , i wouldn't say it was a bad choice. Next time, i would prefer buying Canon cameras."
2,lens jams (again) bought 2nd coolpix L3 at Amazon,"I've had 2 coolpix L3 cameras - the 1st lasted 14 months - this one about 2 yrs. before the lens jammned. Other than that I liked the camera, the pics it took - but will try a different camera now."
4,Great Video and Audio!!,"I have had this camera for 4 years. The photo quality is very good, and I use the 3mp setting.I have to agree it is slow snapping pics, both focus and flash charge times. But...The best part of this camera is it video and sound recording for movies. I have used it in the Oakland Coliseum for the Rolling Stones and in small clubs and bars for our local bands. The recordings of live music performances our outstanding. People can't believe it was recorded on a small camera.I am looking for a newer model, but if the video and audio is not of the same quality, it will be quickly returned."
4,I Really Miss This Camera.,"As an amature photographer, the Nikon Coolpix L3 made me look like a professional! After a few years of owning it I got a lens error. The lens would not go back in no matter what I tried and to have it fixed by a professional I'm sure would have cost more than I paid for the camera so I bought a new Panasonic Lumix. I'm still learning how to use the Lumix but so far, I've not taken a picture that compares to the beautiful ones I took with the Nikon Coolpix."
1,Frills don't matter if batteries constantly die,"This camera functioned acceptably though not impressively for about four months. The main issue is battery life - short at first and now renders the camera unusable. I have tried every type of batter and still find that I can not take more than three pictures without having to replace the batteries. If I place the camera in storage with never used batteries for a few weeks, when I turn it on, I receive a message indicating the batteries must be replaced. I replace, take two or three photos, and then the batteries are dead again. I would not recommend this product to an enemy much less a friend."
2,Expected more from a Nikon,Too slow when using flash. bad pictures when outside during the evening. Flash is weak. Good panoramic feature though.
2,Unimpressed,"I bought this camera because all I needed was a basic point and shoot and this one is cheap and has a nice sleek design and uses AA batteries. Unfortunately, this camera's image quality is terrible. Nearly all images are blurred no matter how careful I am, and the flash/nighttime performance is exceptionally bad. I have used Canon and Minolta in the past with far better results. I dislike this camera so much that I will be giving it to the first taker I find and replacing it, probably with a Canon."
1,Disappointed in Nikon,"As a newspaper editor/photographer, I've always had a high regard for Nikon products. I figured the Nikon Coolpix L3 would be a great pocket camera for my wife. I was wrong. I bought the camera at a retail store, but took it back the next day.Among the problems with this camera: very poor image quality in ""auto"" mode, even in daylight; very weak flash; a rubber cover to the USB cable port that made plugging in the cable difficult (and I'm sure will be the first thing to break); and others. Well, the camera did LOOK nice....After returing the L3, I bought a Kodak EasyShare Z700 (via Amazon) and am pleasantly surprised -- the Kodak is a great camera for about the same price as the disappointing Nikon L3."
4,Nice little snapshot camera,"For the price this is a good camera, I have had no problems using it. The flash works fine, there is no need for extra lights. Give the camera a second to just 'assess' the lighting and you'll see it'll boost the image up by cranking the ISO and that might be where many are complaining about the noise levels. Getting too close to a persons face can distort how they look so it's not the camera. It works great indoors and out. My husband and I just needed a simple camera that fit in our pockets and this one is it. I'm not wild about the way the colors change in the different modes such as sunset and a few others, but that's it. You can't control the ISO so if you are concerned with noise that shows up in JPEG images so this one might not be right for you. With enough lighting the camera doesn't boost the ISO. In some modes you can turn on the flash and override that little problem. For the price it's not a bad camera."
3,"Good, but not great","I've had my camera since Chirstmas '06, and I like it, but it goes through batteries way too fast. I buy the digital batteries, and even those are wasted within taking 50 or so pictures. The quality isn't bad for a such a simple camera, but if you plan on taking a ton of pictures, be prepared to change your batteries every week. I'm going to buy some rechargeables and see if those hold out better."
2,disappointment,"I owned the Nikon Coolpix L3 for 2 days before I returned it. I will agree with others that the pictures are 'noisy' under less than perfect lighting conditions. I took flash pictures indoors and non-flash pictures outside under grey skies and both sets of pictures appeared 'noisy'. I attribute this to the auto-iso feature; (I would love to have been able to preset the ISO setting to see if it made a difference). Because there is only a 3x optical zoom, noise is an issue as you cannot zoom in well enough for most distant subjects and cropping would be necessary, thus magnifying any noise issues present.For me, the ease of carrying does not outweigh the noisy images I received. If your primary need is for a convenient pocket-carry camera then the L3 may fit your needs as it is easily pocketable in a shirt or pants. but be forwarned about image quality."
5,Great Little Workhorse,"I bought this camera while I was on vacation in NM and CO. It works great, takes wonderful landscape photos, close ups of quilts/pets and portaits of people. Auto focus is wonderful. It's easy to operate and shoots videos. Really a lot of fun and the pictures I downloaded to my Mac are sharp and clear. If you want faster shots, switch to the sports setting. Batteries lasted for about 225 - 250 pictures and short movies. Small size makes it easy to carry and use. I've taken over 3,500 photos and it's working perfectly. I think it's a great value."
1,Lens Jams - Waste of Money,"After owning my camera for a few months, the lens on my camera jammed. It turns out to be a common problem with this product. This camera should be recalled. It is defective. I cannot recommend that anyone buy this camera."
3,"I liked the camera, except for.......","I bought this camera a little over a month ago from Target for $179.99. I really liked the design of it and the fact that it was small. I thought it took great pictures and the screen size was just right for me. It was a fairly easy camera to use, but the only downside to it was that every time I took a picture, the screen would go blank/black for about 5 seconds. This got really annoying after a while, because no other camera did this. I decided to return it and get my money back. I later bought a Samsung Digimax S500 5.1mp camera from Walmart and have been happy with my decision ever since."
4,Tiny workhorse,"This is an excellent small digital, and most of the features of the other, larger Nikon digitals, with a better recovery time than many of them. The larger screen is a bonus."
2,Wont recomond,Its not a great item to look for. If you are in a hurry to buy one go for it (like I did). Or else I would say you will get a better brand and quality if you can do little more research.
4,Pretty Good,"Vomitory is sometimes called one of the ""generic"" death metal bands and though there are some truths to that statement, I still like this CD. At first I was kind of taken aback by the first song as in some places it sounds like a mess with not much focus, but by the second song, things started to come together. Without rehashing the generic things typical of death metal, they manage some catchy riffs and overall, the album makes for a pretty cool listen. I've listened to the whole album four times now and am ready for the fifth (in other words, I like it). They may not be groundbreaking or drifting from the path very much, but they deliver what I expected and delivered it well.Recommended."
2,pass...,"These guys really are generic sounding death metal... It sounds like slayer with cannibal corpse vocals. As far as this album, its nothing great. Theire newest release, Opis Mortis vii is a little bit better."
4,Not bad at all,"Solid effort from the Death Metal group Vomitory. Overall brutal assault with growling vocals and a very heavy sound, fans of Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under,Deicide and Gorerotted will love this."
5,totally non-compromising! wimps beware!,"Vomitory's 3rd metal blade release is an unwavering fist in the face of compromise. these gents do not brownnose, and their music shows that. they have an excellent future in the Metal Blade Records company. the music coming off of this disc hits you like a football player head-on! if you're not into death metal, don't buy this disc. if you like all types of metal like I do(except nu-metal), this disc would be welcome in your collection. other death metal bands to enjoy are Nile, Necrophagist, Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, Origin, God Dethroned, etc."
1,Total Noise,"This is total noise, plain and simple, Death Metal at its worst with growling vocals, noisy drums, and lackluster guitar work make Cannibal Corpse look like the Beatles."
2,"The definition of ""generic death metal""","As I read the reviews on this page, I have to wonder if I missed anything while listening to this. Is Vomitory aggressive and fast? Most certainly. Are the songs non-compromising, with technical drums and guttural vox? Indeed. But is that really enough, when guys like Suffocation and Morbid Angel did all this only better 10 years ago? I don't mind generic bands if they know how to play, and Vomitory is devoid of riffs that really flow or hook in any way.I did my best not to fall asleep while listening to the first half of Primal Massacre, so I just can't recommend it. In terms of ""brutal"" metal I recommend Napalm Death or Krisiun, and if you want technical stuff check out Necrophagist or later Pestilence.- Thus says the Pellington"
2,Tepid play about responsibility,"Aitmatov's ""Ascent of Mount Fuji"" is one of the few pieces of fiction dealing with Central Asia. Unfortunataly, it is not that great. In fact, it's slow and not very enlightening at all. The premise is that four friends, and their significant others meet for a ""class reunion"" on the summitt of a Central Asian mountain that they nicknamed ""Mount Fuji"". Supposedly, a Buddhist is supposed to climb that mountain, and give a defense of the wrongs done in life. So, we learn that there is guilt dealing with the disgrace of a fifth friend. Later, the friends's actions cause a death, and they have to deal with that too."
2,Mismatch - Quicken 99 Guide and Quicken 2000,Perhaps I made mistake thinking I could use the Quicken 99 Guide to help install Quicken 2000. I wish I could be proven wrong as I found the instructions very pedestrian on top of lacking in detail for handling error messages and how to remove the data from previous versions.Oh but that MYM DOS 12 wasn't doomed by Y2K
2,Hollow Tips better,I guess this cd is okay but lets face it any Hollow Tip Record is better than this. Save your money for Hollows new Mercenaries Cd when it comes out on Nov.18 or buy Takin No Shorts Vol. 2.
4,Not a romance.,"I wouldn't call this book a romance, though it certainly contains romantic episodes and can even be sentimental at times. but Anya Seton is renowned for her detailed historical research and it is very evident here. based on a real-life character, The Winthrop Woman captures how very difficult life was on the eastern seaboard in those early years; it was a real frontier, and must have been terrifying at times for those women trying to make a home for husband and children in those days. This is what I liked about the book - yes, in places it was a little slow, but Seton brought Elizabeth's day-to-day struggles to life for me. I looked around my little house at the end of it and felt very blessed. In short, a book for those who like well-written genuine historical fiction from a gifted writer."
3,my fault for not noticing that it was readers digest version,"my fault for not noticing that it was readers digest version. Not sellers fault, my fault. I did not see that it was not the ""real"" book."
2,Diappointing After Katherine,"I read this book after reading Katherine--a novel that was a page turner from the start. The Winthrop Woman was a major disappointment. The characters seemed flat and uninteresting, and I had to convince myself to keep reading at several points. The main character, Elizabeth, seemed headstrong and foolish but not in any way that was endearing. She seemed to bring the trouble she faced upon herself and it was difficult to feel any real sympathy for her plight. For someone who is a early colonial history enthusiast the book might have some merit but overall it was not an enjoyable read."
2,No Thank You,"The Winthrop Woman chronicles the lives of John Winthrop, Puritan and first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and his children and relatives. This is also the first Anya Seton book I've read. I found myself bogged down by the history and wishing the characters' stories would continue. I could have done without about 150 pages of history of the Dutch and Indians and the English all battling it out for control. No doubt, Bess had an interesting life and I certainly rooted for her from time to time but oftentimes wanted to give up on this book because the middle was so boring. The book has a satisfying ending and a few ""stirring"" moments but all in all I can't give it more than 2 stars...it was just o.k."
1,The Winthrop Woman,When Phillipa Gregory endorsed this book i assumed it was going to be of the same quality of the books she writes ..... it wasn't
5,Good historical fiction,"Characters are not only interesting but appear historically accurate. Not quiet as good as Katherine by Seton, but still a great read."
3,"Love ""The Winthrop Woman"" but the Kindle edition I downloaded in June 2012 has too many typographical errors!","I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""The Winthrop Woman"", but I have one complaint. Most books, whether printed or electronic, contain some typos. That is perfectly normal and understandable. While reading my recently downloaded Kindle edition, I noticed about one third of the way through the book that there were more that the usual amount of misspelled words. I don't believe they were Dutch or old style English, but just typed without the use of a spell checker. Some of the examples are: lie for he; bam for barn; mm for I think rum; com for corn; and Mallet for Hallet. I loved the story but disappointed in the quality of this version."
4,Antiseptic Towelettes.,"I use these antiseptic towelettes for medicinal purposes, and they hold up well and are good for sterilizing the body. I appreciate that I can buy them on Amazon because I can not find them in the stores. Great product!"
2,Tear too easily,"Packaging (100/box, 10 boxes/case)is convenient, individual packets are easy to open. However, the wipes tear very easily - exactly what you don't want to happen in the process of creating a sterile environment! I've dealt with this issue by unfolding each wipe to it full dimension, then refolding it into thirds prior to use. I'll try a different brand next time."
1,"Dynarex BZK Antiseptic Towelettes, 100/Box, 10 Boxes/Case","Dynarex BZK Antiseptic Towelettes, 100/Box, 10 Boxes/CaseCAME AS 1000 DUMPED IN ONE BOX!GREAT TOWELETTE."
1,Not worthy of the name of Maeve Binchy!,"This has got to be the most stupid movie I've seen in a long time. The fact that Maeve Binchy wrote a book with this name (that this movie is ""adapted"" from) is the only reason I bought this in the first place. I watched the VHS version tonight - 2 volumes, and was less than 2 hours in length. The dialogue was jerky, disjointed, and somehow didn't ""go"" with the picture at all. Music was occasionally inserted, but almost as an afterthought. Things just weren't ""right"" with this movie! It was so bad, I can't even describe what I disliked about it. I wouldn't advise buying this movie, but you have to watch it to see what I'm talking about!"
5,come on ... its thomas the tank engine,my son started playing with these as a toddler ... at 14 he still will not let them go.... they hold up well to hours and hours of play... they are unreasonably expensive but they continue to hold my childs interest and affection and they are well constructed if not cost effective
4,Reliable series set in Venice,"I've come late to the Brunetti series, but am enjoying them tremendously, especially the local color which comes from Donna Leon's deep knowledge of and love for Venice."
4,A good depiction of life in Venice,"This one was actually pretty good, much better than Death at La Fenice. It actually had a perpetrator, and all the loose ends tied up nicely by the end of the book."
2,Not her best work,"I have become a big fan of Donna Leon's Brunetti series. Have read about 10 so far but this one is my least favorite. There were a couple incidents in this book that just didn't ""ring true"" for the characters I have grown to know from the other books. For example I found it hard to believe that Guido would allow his teenage daughter to become involved in finding evidence for a murder which he suspected from the beginning might have Mafia connections. Until now, I have not been a fan of murder mysteries since I don't like graphic descriptions of violence. But the Leon books seldom dwell on those details. Thus I was shocked at the length and detail she used to describe the horrific crime on the video tape. Just don't understand why she thought that was necessary."
4,another evocative Brunetti novel,"I would hardly call them mysteries, as the plot is of secondary interest to the wonderfully evocative descriptions of Venice and its culture, and the intricacies of Brunetti's relationships with his wife and growing children, his inept superior and their extraordinary secretary. Ms Leon is an imaginative writer with great style, and I can't wait for the next instalment."
1,Find a different book - Don't Read it,"I ""read"" the audio version... 8 CDs. At CD 7, I was ready to stop... should have... but I finished it.Books like these tend to have a lot of violence and I understand that. I will bail out at CD 2 or 3 if it is excessive and not required to keep the plot moving.The reason this book should be avoided is WHEN you combine The Ending of the book WITH the graphic violence described 'on the video tapes', there is no redemption, no catharsis, nothing of value for the reader. All the reader is left with is pictures of depravity and a depraved society.What is the benefit of getting merely one more slice of depravity?I can't think of any. I need some Mental Floss to clean this nasty book out of my mind."
3,Not Her Best.,"I discovered Donna Leon's books jusst recently and overall she is anexcellent writer. This one is written extremely well but...I am not aprude but I think the pornographic rape and murder near the end ofthe book could have been tempered down. To me, drawing it out in detailis for one reason-to get people who are normally drawn to this typeof porno, to buy the book. I agree, the transportation of prostitutionis horrific and the public should be aware it goes on but to go on andon in extreme graphics is actually not needed for us to get themessage."
3,Not what it may seem..,"Death and Judgment is a great read.. holds one 's interest from the get go. There is only one great ere in this book, it had already been written, and by Donna Leon.. yes a title change.. from: A Venetian Reckoning first published in 1995. Now a re relaese under this 'new' title in 2006. All things are in order, there is a statement about the new release, but nothing about the title change. To me this was mis leading.. stating a NEW book by Donna Leon is available.. But if one has not read A Venetian Reckoning.. this book should hold any mystery reader's interest."
4,Vito is amazing...,"I played this over and over again just for Vito's playing, some of the most incredible riffs I have ever heard. Some nice catchy tunes as well. Only thing, I never really got used to Mike Tramp's voice. I would buy any White Lion just for the pure enjoyment of listening to Vito play - and boy does he play, it is a thing of beauty!"
4,The best they could give,"This one was the perfect album after 'pride', it has some great songs on it, like Little fighter or Livin' on the edge. Vito (Bratta, guit.) plays with more different styles and sounds, the rest of the band is, as always, great. The perfect summer album. ""So I pack my bags and ride into the sunset.."" Any questions??"
5,Underated guitar player!!!,"I agree with Jazzcat ""Stef"" Vito was one of the greatest guitaritst of the 80's unfortunately we don't hear muscians like that anymore. I listen and bougth the CD's because of Vito's awesome guitar playing, no he wasn't the fastest or most glamorous guitarist, but I can tell when I hear a great rock solid guitarist (I'm a MI graduate) so I know a thing or two about playing the guitar and music in general. You can take just about any muscian from the 80's and will shred all over any ""Players of todays bands"" not a single player stands out today nobody has pushed the guitar to another lever or any other isntrument for that matter. The great drummers, bassist, guitarists of the 80's are gone, I know use to be one of them. This is a great album I would recomment buying."
5,A Great Book!,"I read this book in the 90's but lost it. Now that Eckert Tolley's ""A New Earth"" is being read by millions (including myself)it reminded me of this book which says basically the same thing. This book made me awaken to truth which should be the ultimate goal of every human being."
3,The Sony 1.4X teleconverter does not work with the G70400 lens.,"Much to my surprise, the Sony 1.4x teleconverter does not auto-focus with the Sony G series 70-400 mm zoom. True enough, it says that the Sony 1.4x teleconverter was designed specfically for use with the Sony 2.8 lenses; however, it does not say that it will not allow your Alpha a900 DSLR to autofocus with another G series lens and the T/C. I just recently bought both the G70400 lens and the 1.4x Sony teleconverter to marry to my Sony Alpha A900, all purchased through Amazon. I am now waiting endlessly for my pre-ordered Sony A77 body in hopes that hooking the lens and T/C to this new technology will autofocus together. Hope springs eternal which may be the time that the A77 is finally released."
1,Boooring out of hell,"Truly atrocious! Avoid it. It has no plot and it's cheap. Meatloaf, known for being a charming, funny and charismatic artist, is just like a lazy, unispired big sack o'coal in this one. And it's booooooring!"
1,one of the dumbest moives ever made!,This moive is not worth the effort to load it into the dvd player.
2,"Meathead, er, ah, Meatloaf - Yuck! But at least the soundtrack was decent and had Cheap Trick...","Dull, but surprisingly not-very-funny movie.I'm not really into either Al(ice) Coops orMeathead, whoops, (heh-heh, couldn't resist),er, ah Meatloaf. The Cheap Trick song mentionedabove was actually Everything Works (if you letit), which also now appears on the very finerelease, ""The Essential Cheap Trick."" Tricksters:look for the new release ""Rockford, Rockford"",which I hope to have a review for shortly. Rockon!"
5,Meatloaf rocks without singing a note,"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. A great cast: Meatloaf, Khaki Hunter, Art Carney, Jos Spano, Alice Cooper, Hank Williams Jr., Roy Orbison, Don Cornelius, etc. Great musical performances by Blondie, duet of Hank Jr. & Roy, Blondie, Asleep At The Wheel. Some of the greatest lines of all time. Story gets a little trippy but makes sense and one of the all-time strangest endings. If you are a 70s rock and roll fan, this is the movie for you."
2,Still can't touch The Hammer,"Usher works hard and in today's music world that's enough to be great, but historically he lacks the skills of any of the greats of the past."
5,U gotta love USHER!!!,"Simply an amazing dvd from an amazing artist!! Even if you don't like Usher, there's no doubting that he is an amazing perfomer...especially with his little slide step move(from the U Got it Bad video) which he does even better on this dvd! Definately the best scene is with the ""JEAN JACKET""(you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch it for yourself). Overall, I am a big usher fan, and if you are too, then there is no reason why you shouldn't own this one!!!"
5,Usher's 8701 DVD,"This is one amazing concert. I love this concert! His dance moves are breathtaking.... he's breathtaking! If you dont have this dvd, I would seriously pick this one up! This is easily ONE of my favorite DVD's in my DVD collection.(...)"
5,Usher 8701,"Wow!! He's so cute!! This is a good price for the DVD. I don't think this is a good DVD for kids maybe 16-17 years old or younger. Some of the stuff he does, like putting his hand down his pants etc. I wouldn't want my own child to see (if I had one.) But his dancers are really very pretty and aren't ""trashy"" like some of the girls that we see on ""MTV."" They are seductive, but they're not nasty. In my opinion. But you can tell what a great performer he is and how much the crowd loves him."
4,Excellent buy,"The watch is just amazing. The digital display of the thermometer, coupled with the ana-digital display just bowled anyone who came across to see it. It has a large dial but is extremely light in comparison to the other watches in the same series. The display is crisp and the tide-graph is mostly accurate. It has all the features of the Casio Sports series and is a well suited with both formal and casual wear. The world clock and the auto-light on feature is impeccable. However, the auto-backlight display is battery consuming so users would need to change the battery (life of 10 years) in about half its lifetime. I would give it a thumbs up on all accounts."
2,some redeeming qualities.,"A normally cheapoid Casio. The digital display is impossible to see in daylight, but you can activate auto-lighting tilt device. Band length simple to adjust. A true monument to over-engineering. The moon phase and tide data are really useful in mid-town traffic. Wonder why these Japanese rocket-scientists did not put in a simple compass? My science-minded girlfriend participated in an experiment: She tucked the watch in her underarm for 15 minutes while watching TV & simultaneously held an old fashioned glass & mercury thermometer between her lovely lips. Readings were identical!"
5,no regrets,"I meant to get the 3rd edition but got the 2nd by accident. The second is still a treasure trove of good, useful information and heck, it was only ten bucks so I have no regrets. Also, there are things in the 2nd edition that aren't in the 3rd edition plus the merchant offered good, fast service so I'm happy."
4,Better than some newer books,"I wish this author would come out with a third edition of the book, since the CompTIA Security+ test that it tracks to has changed twice since this book was published. On the plus side, this book covers more topics than other books for Security+ prep, and helped me to pass the test recently. The book is written in an easy to follow style. I did not use the lab manual, which is a companion volume, so the negative reviews on that do not pertain to the value of this volume to my experience."
2,Don't list books on back order,"The book was on back order, I was not notified until I inquired after two weeks. I should have been notified immediatlely or the book should not have been shown as available."
5,Great Book for Collectors,"This book is a must have for toy soldier collectors. It has a very representative listing of varous toy soldiers, with excellent photographs. The section on Britains in particular is very worthwhile. This book is always open and by my side when I'm shopping on eBay.It is a marvelous addition to any collector's library."
2,Apology to author,Suggesting that the author only tacked on UML and C++ to make more money is a little misguided. I dont think the book delivers what it promises - C++ and UML - but implying the author (a college professor) did something for money was a little dumb.
3,Disappointing,"I gave up on this book when I reached the extended example of object-oriented analysis, design and implementation. The analysis was ok; the design dropped a few elements without explanation, but was largely coherent.The implementation was a nightmare. It looked like procedural C++, with practically no relationship to the analysis and design.I think the book does a good job of conveying the time-tested key concepts behind software engineering. It should not be taken seriously as a discussion of object-oriented methodology."
3,This book seems overly general to be of use to anyone,"The title of the book is very misleading, in that the book has very little uml and c++. Worse however is the lack of good problems and examples throughout the book. It seems like a watered-down version of Ghezzi's Software-Engineering book, the latter of which I would much more recommend. Some instructors may prefer Schach because it has *something* on uml and OOA&D, but it is probably better to supplement Ghezzi with a good book from this area (one I have yet locate)."
2,lets tack uml and c++ on the title so we can make more money,"The title of this review says it all.The author tacked on a couple of chapters on a traditional undergraduate textbook on software engineering. Its a decent textbook, but deserves to be blasted because of its misleading title - IMHO."
1,I didn't open It once,The class was a joke and buying this book was a joke. Use common sense and I am sure you can get an A in any class this is required for.
4,More heavy duty than it looks,"When I looked at the pictures for this item my opinion was that it was too thin and looked kind of weak. I ended up purchasing it anyways out of necessity (It is hard to find them in my area, all the stores have to order them, and at a much higher cost), and was pleasantly surprised. The item was as heavy duty as it should be, and worked well. The application I used it for was to upgrade the power cable for my alternator, and no problems so far. Due to size, it will not perform correctly without large gauge crimpers (meaning you can't just use pliers)."
1,What can Perl be used for in bioinformatics?,"This is a brief introduction to some of the things that one can do in Perl; it lacks scope and has few useful examples, but gives a flavor for what is available. It needs some programming experience to get much out of it."
1,too short to be really useful,"Look at other general intro books on Perl, and ask yourself: how much useful stuff can any human cram into a 43-page book for beginners? The answer is: not much. I see very little sense in investing in this tiny book."
5,Everyone swears by this,I was just recently elected to the board of directors in our association and a novice at it. This book has been referred to me by many people who have served on a board of directors and or are in property management.
5,A solid dose of great short stories. 5 stars *****,"The one thing I came away from after reading these stories was, that Scott Nicholson is not confined to the horror genre: he can write solid pieces of fiction that I would suggest anyone read, even if they are not into horror.Picks in this collection are the entire book; just read them all and enjoy.Be sure to read the author 'after words' section at the end. There's some interesting info on where Nicholson got his ideas for these and what mags they were published in, for any writers out there.5 STAR ESSENTIAL RATING. *****"
5,Extra's a plus,The extras on this set are great especillay those on season six. As usual the commentaries give you an chance to find out what might be involved/behind the make a show such as this. Enjoyed this set just as much as I did CSI:Miami and CSI:LV (the original).
4,Love CSI NY,"The only issue we have is that it would not play in the DVD player. This was not the seller's fault though. The new one he sent us worked a bit better. It plays perfectly fine in the laptop, so it was no big deal."
3,I prefer NCIS,"Not too bad. I LOVE NCIS, so I thought I might like this series. Some of the storylines are too grusome for me, and the music is too obnoxious. This series also has a lot going on- up to 3 different crimes being solved in one episode. Very serious, not even a hint of humor. I gave it 3 stars because the actors are good."
4,CD 'Shake Your Soul' review,The product was delivered in very good condition. I have no complaints and recommend this seller.
2,Not yet received,I have not received the book. I hope that I do one day. Then I will be able to review it.
1,rentright light ten units,"This software is a demo package that expires after thirty-days, after the thirty days it can not be used. It was not advertised as a demo program, through Amazon nor the manufacture. I attempted to contact Amazon as well as the manufacture with negative result."
1,P.O.S.!,"This software is an absolute P.O.S. due to one MAJOR flaw that I've found over the four years I used this product. The flaw is the backups of your database i.e. tenants, buildings, etc CANNOT be restored! Error message displayed says it cannot UPGRADE and cannot load database. Other than that I've got used to this software wiping out my info and started over several times over this time period. Now, I'm going to try another software provider...pass on this one!"
3,not compatible with imaginarium,"We bought the imarinarium play table but the center board broke, so since all thomas and imaginarium are suppose to be commpatible we bought this board....well it's to big and toys r us said to bad! I asked how I could find a board to fit our table they told me imagiaruim was by them and there was no way of getting another we just needed to buy a whole new table. THe Paducah, KY store manger told me this was the lease of his concerns and to deal with it. I'm very unhappy! However this is a nice bright board if you have a thomas table."
5,Great fun!,We just received this playboard a couple of days ago. My son loves it! He is almost 2 and really enjoys playing with all of his Thomas trains. This playboard makes playing more interesting. It arrived in fine condition...we didn't have the problem the other reviewer had. My son has a train table (not the Thomas one) and it fits perfectly. The playboard is a great addition to our Thomas the Tank Engine collection.
3,Somewhat disappointed,Length:: 0:46 MinsI bought this play board for a train table that I built for my 2 1/2 year old grandson. The play board arrived with multiple scratches and several dents around the edges. The worst problem was that the board was warped approximately 1/2 inch and would not lay flat on the table. I thought that for $60 this would be something more than a laminated scene over press board. I would have returned it but did not want to disappoint my grandson. The cosmetic defects did not bother him.
5,Love this item...,"This is one of the best investments we have made. It cleans up great. Actually last month my son decided to use a pen to this table top and the Mr Clean bar got it out. My son loves this and plays with it w/ everything. Thomas, Matchbox & Lego's. I would recommend it to anyone. Watch for the deal Toys r us has though... when you buy the table, you get the top free. Thats the BEST deal!"
5,SPHEERIS SURVIVES!,"SPHEERIS=MAGIC=SOULFUL=ETERNAL.WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ""..TAP DANCING KID,"" (WHICH I FOUND THE WEAK ALBUM IN HIS CAREER AND, ODDLY ENOUGH, WAS MY FIRST)THERE ARE NOTHING BUT GOOD ALBUMS IN SPHEERIS' ENTIRE COLLECTION. I LOVE THEM ALL. I WAS IN TOUCH WITH THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT THESE CD'S WERE RESURRECTED AND KEPT IN PRODUCTION, DEPITE THE SPHEERIS FAMILY'S APPARENT LACK OF INTEREST (A CONSTANT SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION FOR HIM). IT WAS HE THAT MADE SURE I HAD A COMPLETE COLLECTION OF CD'S AS I HAD BOUGHT MANY COPIES OF THE VINYLS OVER THE YEARS (I KEPT PLAYING THEM TO DEATH). I BELIEVE HE IS DECEASED NOW (AS HE STOPPED RETURNING MY E-MAILS AND HAD BEEN QUITE ILL THE LAST WE WROTE), BUT I AM SURE HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO KNOW HIS CAMPAIGN AND DEDICATION PAID OFF. SPHEERIS SURVIVES!!AT ANY RATE SPHEERIS WAS GREAT RIGHT TO THE END. ALL HIS ALBUMS WERE/ARE GOOD, THOUGH ONE MAY ATTACH MORE TO ONE OR ANOTHER MORE DEEPLY. DON'T MISS ANY OF THEM"
1,The worst I have ever seen!,"When I watched this movie I kept asking myself, what the hell is this? I found it poorly acted, ridiculous and stupid.What a shame after the other two, those were so good, please do not waste money buying this piece of rubbish!!It leaves you with a very sour taste in your mouth!"
4,Great Entertainment,The movie was good entertainment for a light evening away from the usual daily stresses. It had an optimistic and realistic ending.
1,To Be the Worst!,I had the misfortune to see this movie years ago as a tv mini-series. It was completely awful!!! Lindsey Wagner as Paula? She should stick with the Bionic Woman. It was a real shame that such a good book was destroyed with this movie. Please believe the previous reviews and save your money!
1,Bad DVD,"I didn't pay attention to the other reviews of this DVD and decided to try it. Bad Idea!!!! It is so unlike the book as to be laughable. Jack Figg wasn't even in the first series of Emma Harte novels. Philip Amory never had anything to do with the stores, and Sandy was the head of Harte Enterprises and wouldn't have been gambling in Hong Kong. Shane never resented Paula's work in the book. The DVD never mentions Paula's first twins. Where did they go since their father had died? What happened to Linnett, Paula's younger daughter? Lindsay Wagner as a red haired Brit is a disgrace. Her British accent comes and goes. I can see why Barbara Taylor Bradford introduces this DVD. It needed all the help it could get.Please pay attention to this review and DON'T waste your money on this DVD."
5,Possibly the best Western L'Amour wrote.,"Flint - I enjoy reading this book every time. I have read it once a year or so and I am always amazed by the detail Louis put into it. You can imagine the hole in the wall, the hidden pasture, the Red Stallion. You feel for his character, going back to the wilderness to die, the will to live, the fear. From the beginning of the book till the end, from the moment he tells Nugent where to go to the abrupt conversations ending with a smoking Smith & Wesson. You will want to read everything Louis wrote after reading this one!"
4,Solid western from Mr L'Amour,'Flint' is a solid western from Mr L'Amour. Interesting main character and plenty of gunplay and drama to hold the readers attention. Some nice bad guys and a series of twists keep this one going right along. Well worth reading if you are getting back into westerns like me.Four and a half cactus for this one.Crunch Hardtack
4,One of his best,"There is no doubt this is one of L'Amour's best. This one keeps you going from beginning to end. No reason to go into the plot, as plenty of other reviewers have done that before me. But suffice it to say that Flint will stay in your memory for a long time."
5,Comments On Flint,"Flint, in my opinion, was one of L'amour's greatest works. The book has a lot of depth, emotion, and an ingeneous storyline. I enjoyed it emmensly."
5,Solid L'Amour,"Flint takes a bit of different turn for L'Amour, but that doesn't matter, it's a solid, well written western fiction book. I highly recommend it."
4,Classic Western,"I bet I have read this book at least 7 times in my life, and it was one of the first Kindle books I bought two years ago. Louis L'Amour makes you feel as if you are the main character, and can wrap you around the story and make you think you are there - smelling the smoke, the tension, winning the girl without the foul language and gratuitous sex scenes. Wish we had more writers like this today."
4,A good musical concert,The concert is lively and the musical performance is good except the sound recording of this DVD is not up to expectation.
5,One of the best rock albums ever made.,"What can I say. This is a killer record. Jake E. Lee's guitar playing is off the chain! You won't believe it. You really have to hear it with headphones to get all the little nuances. Gillen's vocals are top notch. If you like 80's hard rock, you must have this album. It was severly underrated! Good luck trying to find a copy. I saw them at Center Stage in Atlanta in 1989 or 90-the night Winter's Call was the #1 requested video on MTV (yes MTV used to actually play music videos). It was a concert I will never forget!"
5,Raunch & Roll at its finest!,"Love the self titled debut "" Badlands"". I wore the cassette tape out that I had from 1989 long ago...I finally got around to getting it on disc thanx to those who still have copies for sale. Got one in mint condition for $20. Very happy to have them again. Listen to it daily."
5,70s Metal With A 90s Twist,"Badlands' music is 70s metal with a 90s twist. Drawing equally from English rock such as Zeppelin, Humble Pie, Free, and Bad Company; Southern boogie such as ZZ Top, Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet, the Outlaws, the Winter Brothers, and Blackfoot; and American metal like Mountain, Montrose, and Grand Funk Railroad, Badlands stands apart from the typical ""hair metal"" crowd and makes music their way. It's such a shame that they only made one more album before disbanding (Ray Gillen, R.I.P.), but it was great while it lasted."
2,Mediocre at Best,"I can't believe all the 5 star reviews for this lame album! This so-called Metal album is neither Rock nor Metal -- just a watered-down rock-cliche retread. None of the songs stand out, unless you're so desperate for a Plant-fix that you'll suck up any kind of Zep copycat vocals. Sigh.Save yourself a few dollars and forget this dog."
5,Perfect!,"The best guitar player Ozzy has played with. Jake E. Lee plays hard, fast and soulful. Ray Gillen is so good. He sings like Dio and Plant. Soars like Perry and moves you like Mercury. A super group completed by Eric Singer. Just find him on youtube or search for his name on Google. Best drummer in the world. This band blows any other band. Listen to Voodoo Highway and Dusk too."
3,Good but not great,"The members of badlands are ex Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Jake E Lee, Kiss drummer Eric Singer, the now dead vocalist Ray Gillen (once a short time member of Black Sabbath) and a some guy on bass. Some people consider this release a masterpiece... I'd say it's a quite good heavy metal album featuring a great singer and a guitar masturbator. The follow up ""Voodoo highway"" is slightly better."
4,cd review,this item came in a timely manner and was a nice edition to my cd collection . besides the fact i could'nt find the mp3 on here for a song off this cd to put onto my mp3 player .
4,Hidden Gem!,"I was never much of an Ozzy fan so I didnt really know of Jake E Lee ... (was he bruce's cousin?) ... but this is his masterpiece ... unlike other 80's guitarists busy showing you how fast they can play and how many notes in a second (only to end up sounding like a pack of angry bees) ... jake had funk, jazz, style, spanish influences and more throw in so the songs never sound the same. Ray's voice is killer, Eric needs to produce something like this for kiss fans and greg holds it all together.Love this album and it deserves more respect in the greater community. Buy it!"
5,One of my top 5 favorite cd's of all-time! Electrifying!!!,"It is so refreshing to see so many people that have heard this cd give it 5 stars, because Badlands definitely deserves it. Where to start? How about Ray Gillen (rest his soul), what an incredible range in his voice and releaser of his emotions. He hold's nothing back. All I can say is ""perfection"" for Ray. Check out ""Voodoo Highway"" and the Japanese Import ""Dusk"" to hear more of Ray's incredible vocal talents. They're all worth the money! Jake E. Lee is incredible on lead, Greg Chaisson plays seamlessly in tune with Jake and the drummer Eric Singer is just balls-to-the-wall fantastic. The sound and soul of this band is so tight that every note just bleeds ""perfection"". Any true rock/metal/blues/soul fan will want this cd for their collection. Pure musical brilliance from start to finish! Crank it up and get lost in the emotion of the music. What a ride!"
3,THESE GUYS KNOW HOW TO ROCK,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CD'S FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS. THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANY MORE. THIS IS THE KIND OF GOOD MUSIC THAT NIRVANA KILLED. I FOR ONE CAN'T WAIT TILL THIS GENRE BECOMES RETRO SO THE BREAK IT ALL OUT AGAIN.
5,Great album,I just kinda rediscovered badlands. Its been awhile since I listend to this. But It really sounds good even now. Some of the 80's stuff doesnt stand the test of time but this does. Great guitar and vocals. Ands some great riffs. It has a really good vibe going. One of the few albums worthy enough to buy a cd to replace my worn cassette tape.
5,SOULFUL BLUES ROCK,"This is a great CD. If you enjoy blues-based rock music then you will enjoy this CD. Ray Gillen was blessed with a great voice and he puts it to good use here. Jake E. Lee's guitar work is also top notch, I especially love his rhythm work. This is some great blues-based rock, what else is there to say?www.electriceyes.us"
3,"Maybe, maybe not","I was very excited to get this makeup case, I have been wanting one for a long time! It looks amazing and i love how one side of the train is deep as my nail polish collection fits there just fine. It was quite dissapointing to open it though as the train seemed really weak and ws hard to open. I have been using it for about a month now, and I do have to say, that it is getting easier and easier to open and close the train. I still get a bit stressed sometimes, thinking I might break it, but I think that is just me being paranoid. So basically it is a good product, but i don't think i would pick it again."
1,waste of money,This product did nothing for me. I follow the dose instructions and did not see any results. It was defenetly a waste of money.
1,If I knew,If I would have known that the product would not work I would not have wasted my money on it.
2,Fast shipping but no results,"This product did not produce the desired results. The first two times I followed the instructions, the third time I double the quantity and still nothing. Considering the low cost and the shipping price it was not worth returning for a refund, I rendered the product to the garbage."
1,Doesnt Work,Very disappointed in this product. The cost is high for it not to work.would like to have a refund
3,Decent,"Left glove light works still, a few months of using, and the right glove worked for about a week. Now it flickers on and off whenever it feels like working."
4,Great Coffee,"I have owned this coffee maker now for 1 month. The coffee has superb flavor. Only 1 drawback, it is difficult to clean."
5,simple and effective,This is not a fancy product and it doesn't claim to be. It just makes good coffee. I have had none of the problems with leakage that others have written about. It is easy to set up. The timer works well and I like the automatic cutoff. Because of the metal in its construction it is heavier than som other coffee makers. This might be an issue if you have to slide it out from under a cabinet to pour water into the tank. I would recommend this product to anyone.
1,"Not ""All-Metal""","This is false advertisement. I wanted an all-metal coffee maker for health purposes. Most coffee makers are mostly plastic with very hot water coming into contact with plastic at various stages like the part from which the water drips and the plastic filter holder. The cancer concerns about drinking hot water after it contacts plastic are huge. This Hamilton Beach model claimed to be all-metal, but it is not. The most important parts (for health purposes) are not metal at all. The water drip part is all plastic, the cone filter holder is all plastic and even the rim of the carafe is all plastic.If you are researching this coffee maker for health reasons, then move on."
1,Apple Green Hamilton Beach Eclectrics 40111 All-Metal 12-Cup Coffeemaker,"We ordered this coffee pot Dec 3rd, to be told by Today's concepts that they have to go through the manufacturer Hamilton Beach to get it. Well, Hamilton Beach already told me that it is discontinued. The problem is that Today's Concepts, Amazon and Foto Connection are advertising that they have this product in Apple color, but once you order it, you'll find out they don't. They are all going through Hamilton Beach who doesn't make it any more. It's a waste of time. Just and FYI for you all."
3,Mixed review,"We have had this product for about 1 yr. The coffee it makes is fine, it's easy to use and clean. What has become troubling to me is the plastic coating, found where the coffee comes out of the machine and flows into the carfe, is peeling off. In big chunks I might add. It has made me decide to trash this unit and go look for a new, different coffee maker."
4,Wish we could have more color options like this in other brands.,"I love the LOOK of this coffe pot I had mine for a year and a couple months and all of the sudden it made an electric ""noise"" and the warming plate did not work any longer! I thought I was out of luck! I called Hamilton Beach and they said no problem and are sending a replacement! I am scared that it will also break but I love the sea breeze color and that is why I bought it!!!! But if you are looking for quality for the price other than esthetically this pot is a gamble....nov08: I have had the replacement only for maybe 6 months and already there is a problem, the coffee pot now will not turn off and so I have to unplug it to turn off the warming plate.. So the first one would not heat and this one won't stop.. But still I love it because of the color and wish it wasn't discontinued."
4,Excellent coffee maker,This is a very heavy duty coffee maker made of metal instead of plastic. It brews excellent coffee and comes in great colors to accessorize your kitchen.
1,"You will love the looks, but IT WILL break soon","We loved ours too. The looks, the taste , the design. See other reviews. It WILL break. Mine broke, they replaced it, it broke again. I am trying to now get a refund or a different product. One day, it will JUST STOP working. Usually after about 3 to 4 months of use, if you use it on a regular basis."
3,Cold Coffee!!,"I was really influenced by the other reviews on this product, so I asked for it for Christmas. It is well built, but keeps the coffee only lukewarm, at best. And, this morning, I found coffee leaking from large horizontal crack in the carafe. After a half-hour searching the Internet, including the Hamilton Beach website, I cannot find a replacement carafe."
1,All metal in all the wrong places - not where it counts,"I wanted an all metal coffee maker, not one with plastic in all the areas that contact the water. I really feel it is unfair advertising to have this allowed to call itself all metal.I am concerned, as many others, with heated water contacting plastic surfaces as heat causes leaching of many chemicals.I replaced a Cuisinart which is much quieter. This pot is very noisy.The Cuisinart chimes when it is finished brewing. On this, when the noise finally stops, it is done. It is awkward to fill. I did not keep the box or I would have returned it.It is nice looking,especially in the blue."
4,Good quality machine,"This coffeemaker is made well, with metal housing instead of plastic. The filter cone holder is large enough to prevent spillovers when brewing, and the coffee stays hot without tasting burned for over an hour. The only drawback that I see in using this machine is that the timer clears itself after every use, requiring you to reset the time and timer for each automatic brewing cycle. For regular brewing without a timer, this is a great machine!"
4,Inexpensive and good quality,"These are working out well. The only issues were I had to soak all in a citrus based copper cleaning solution overnight to clean them up before use.I prefer the tin coated lugs as oxidation is not an issue. But for the money, one can't beat these bare copper lugs."
3,All of which go to Joe Flanigan's chest hair...,"This movie is pretty crappy. Wait, make that INSANELY crappy. I saw this on Lifetime years ago and I finally bought it a month ago. Ask me why. Go ahead, ask me. It's because Joe (Lionel) is the cutest thing ever. And he takes off his shirt. Exposing his chest hair. Yes, Joe Flanigan is so cute in this film he makes me forget my grammar skills. It's totally worth a couple bucks."
5,Very good Movie,Shows what it was like to start out in the movie business and make a go of it great down to earth movie
4,eths textbook,"I use it in my eths classthere r so many to read....i hate the reading, but the book is ok.its not new ,but can be used. Meanwhile, its very cheap, thats importantthx"
4,The Building of an International Icon,"""Brand of the Tartan: The 3M Story"" by Virginia Huck, written in 1955 when 3M celebrated its Golden Anniversary, is a reasonably detailed account of the company's early beginnings with sufficient documenting pictures to satisfy the inquisitive reader. The story falls somewhat short in tying the company into the historic period and its industry, though it does offer periodic financial data and growth statistics. Heavy emphasis is given to the development of different product lines ranging from great detail to broad generalizations. Though a little repetitious and vague at points, and possibly a bit disjointed, ""Brand of the Tartan"" does a basically competent job of presenting 3M's first half century and outlining the underlying values and managerial perspectives that have been key to its 100 year plus survival."
5,BEST CD YET!!!!,"This is Death By Stereo's best cd yet, 5 STARS!!!!!!This cd is like a PUNCH in the face, the songs just don't let up through this album.Plus lots more SCREAMING compaired to there other cd's. If you like hardcore screamo or metalcore or anything like that I suggest going out and buying it!A Must have for all you hardcore kids!!!"
5,Punk Rock with more than enough musical chops.,"The fury in the band is finally realized. The guitars are louder, the drumming more technical and the vocals more angry. The evolved sound suggests that a violent guitar hero read a Time magazine and got a conscience. The Death holds on to their original values and at the same time put out records that sound nothing like each other. I for one applaud their bravery to again put out a record that sounds nothing like the one before it. Each record is completely different and this one is no exception. I think this record will open up the musical ears of rebellious kids and at the same time make metal kids care about something more than mere shock value. Buy this now!"
5,Wow i am impressed!!!,"I must say after listening to some of their older stuff i thought this band was a dissapointment, but i went out on a limb after hearing 3 tracks form this cd and bought it since i will be seeing them shortly with the greatest band ever Avenged Sevenfold, i really like the drum work these guys have as well as some amzing guitar players and lyrics, i also love how M. Shadows from A7X makes his presence felt on this cd in the two tracks he is in, all in all this cd is a must have if u r into waking the fallen or city of evil from A7X, or if u like Atreyu at all!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,WHY do people like this book?,"This is quite possibly the most dissapointing novel I have ever read, horror or otherwise. After two GREAT books in the series, the final book is rushed and features every two-bit hackneyed method the author could come up with. It starts off great for the first 200 pages, don't get me wrong. The parts with Elizabeth, Vlad, Harker, and Zsusanna are absoulutely perfect. But once we get to England...it's formula all the way, with some 'twists' thrown in to attempt to keep the reader guessing. This book is deservingly spoiled when I say that the ending to the entire series is cobbled together from the last ten pages of the book, and everything beforehand is utterly pointless.But if you want a good read, you can always just read the first 200 pages and then make up your own ending. That's what I wish I had done before I had unfortunetly kept reading."
4,Reformed Vampires?? C'mon!,"This third and final volume retelling the familiar Bram Stoker original Dracula augments the story by introducing the legend of Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who lived some 150 years after Vlad Tepesh (Stoker's vampire model) - her real story is well described in the accessible The Blood Countess by Andrei Codrescu. Elizabeth is accused of living a life of debauchery and patronage of occult arts as well as the murder of some 650 virgins in order to bathe in their blood. Imprisoned by clerical authorities for 5 years of interrogation on the eve of the horrific Thirty Years War of religious doctrines, she was never convicted. The Bathory family included Duke Stepan of Transylvania who ascended the throne of Poland and Lithuania by marrying the daughter of the last Jagellonian king and then proceeded to roll back the conquests of Ivan the Terrible. The real facts of this time are more interesting than the vampiric literary inventions."
3,Somewhat disappointed in this one,"After reading the first two installments of this trilogy, I just knew Kalogridis would blow me away with the final book. Not so. I liked the way she incorporated Bram Stoker's Dracula into the story, but the ending was nothing like I expected."
1,Reader,There are much better books that explain the war and fight aginst the attempt by loyalist to ''relive ulster of those fenian ba**** only by killing them''(words of a uvf man) It is loyalist propaganda.
2,The Irish Republican Army,"This book is designed for a pre-teen, at best... for the cost, I thought it would be a credible history of the troubles in Ireland. Instead, it was a thin, barely there book that left me feeling robbed of my hard-earned money."
3,enjoyable,"Page McConnell's new album is what you'd expect. The song writing is mediocre while the improvisation is strong. Most songs sound like they could have been penned during the Vida Blue era or the last five years of Phish. In other words, there is no 'Cars Trucks Buses' or even a 'Most Events Aren't Planned.' The album follows McConnell's usual style of rock with flavors of funk and psychedelia. The use of electronic drum beats may be the unexpected dynamic. The issue with ""Page McConnell"" is that it is a solo album by a great accompanying musician. There's nothing wrong with the disc, it's simply that there are no significant stand-outs. ""Page McConnell"" is an enjoyable listen that probably won't get heavy rotation."
2,Sugar Free,"I love hot cinnamon, but not sugar free. The documentation did not say sugar free and I am here with two bags. Very mild taste."
3,Not the same as dentist,I ordered because the percentage was the same as I had from the dentist but it didn't whiten like my previous brand.
2,Not as effective as the original version of Night White,"I don't know what changes were made to the product, but with the original version my teeth whitened immediately with one application. This does not seem to be as effective."
3,it was recommended by my dentist,it is not as strong as others i've tried. unfortunately for me i do not recall the name of the brand that whitened my teeth in one use. i can tolerate a stronger product. bought the 6 pk thinking i'd save money. not sure what i will do with it. i dislike returning products.
4,teeth whitening,"Great product! My dentist uses this in his office as well. When you try this, be consistent and use as directed every day and the difference is noticeable very quickly. I recommend this and the price is great."
4,Great Cost Effective Product,"I have been purchasing this product via Amazon for a number of years. The products that I have received always have a long expiry date and it's a really cost effective way to whiten teeth. I love the fact that you only have to wear the product for an hour a day, which makes life alot easier."
5,Smile - it works,I orginally got this product from my dentist until i realized how much i could save by buying it via Amazon. This product works
2,Yellowish Teeth,"A caveat to this product and others like it. If you have naturally yellowish teeth, no amount of whitener will make your teeth brilliant white. It will lighten them a shade or two only. This product works best after you've had a professional cleaning."
5,Good Deal,I was very pleased with the service I received. The product was delivered on time and at the best price (including shipping) that I could find.
1,Doens't even deserve 1 star - horrible reaction to this concocted whitener,"Terrible! After less than 5 minutes with the trays in my mouth, my gums were burning, aching, tender, swelling and dyed a very strange, light, almost white, color - pain ensued for more than an hour. Caused fast heart rate and headache - thought something was really wrong...I don't know what is in this product, who mixed this concotion, or what the mixture is, but you do not want it. At least I do not want it....ever again."
3,it really works,"this product does really whiten, just be careful to have it on for only 30-45 mins though as it can make your teeth quite sensitive and painful. maybe a good idea to use sensodyne before and after.otherwise, beats spending an hour at the dentists' anytime."
3,Actually didn't work,This is my second time buying this whitening product and I can say the first time was a pleasure second time didn't work. I don't know what happen but it didn't work.
2,Solar questionable?,"This is overall a functional nice looking watch, but I agree that the face scratches too easily and after 3 years the solar recharge has stopped working (even if the battery is brand new). Yes, I know it has worked for three years, but now that the solar recharge doesn't work, it goes through batteries extremely quickly."
1,Lousy wrist band,Got a casio wave ceptor watch with metal band for Christmas with the same wrist band design- the band pulled apart at the case the first day. The metal pin that holds the band on is attached to the case with a cheap rubbery plastic peice that rips out easily.The worst part is if you look at Casio's warrentee the band and case are not covered.My watch is now held together with epoxy - very fashionable! Goes good if you have glasses held together with masking tape.My advise is move on and find a watch with a metal to metal connection from the band to the case. Don't buy this one!
4,good watch but plastic window,"The window cover is not mineral glass, its plastic very easy to get scratches. Otherwise watch is excellent, good value for money. Controls are easy. Dual time is a cool feature."
2,Disappointing,"I bought the watch 15 months ago and the thing has officially gone kaput. It became increasingly difficult to keep it charged, and now it is ""frozen,"" displaying a random date and ""4A"" as the day. If you want something that will last more than a year and a half, I'd keep looking."
4,very nice watch,"Its very light weight. I bought this because no hassle of changing battery every 2-3 years. I could not find waveceptor watch in this price range. LCD digits are thin, but readable. Very nice watch."
4,Good watch,"I was looking for a watch that will not have me run for a new battery every once in a while and didn't require fancy functions. So this was a perfect match. Unit received had one visible scratch, but that doesn't prevent it from being a good watch of basic functions."
5,Great Watch!,"This is a great watch! It looks nice and is a very good size for my wrist. The solar function is great. I have been using the watch for about 5 months with main light exposure being flourescent, moderate exposure to sunlight, and some (cold) days wearing sweatshirts that covered the watch and I have not seen the battery drop below the ""Hi"" charge level.The one downside is that the watchface is plastic so it does scratch fairly easily."
3,Better for people running condos then living in them,"This book is made for your condo association, not you. It gives them forms, step by step instructions, and may be a good reference for anyone in an HOA (Home Owners Association), but it doesn't give answerws that you may want, such as...""If I ask the condos to fix the stairs leading to my condo, how long do they have to respond? How much can they leagally raise the rates each year?"" And other questions like these. It doesn't really tell you what to do if you feel that your rights have been violated either. If you are on the board of your association though, you really should own this."
2,Boring,Some of the special effects in the movie are great I will give it that but the majority of the movie is extremely boring. The first 60 minutes are dreadful to sit through- you can almost just fast forward to the last 15 min of the movie and you will not miss out on anything.
1,Too simplistic,Buyer beware...the book is padded in large part by graphs and data. The actual chapters are short and can be covered in a day...This is a beginner's book with little insights...Professional stay away!
1,The LiLies Have Wilted,"This movie was very bad. Not just bad, terrible. It was so very boring and it portrays young men in a bad manner. Like they're objects. Being a young dude myself, I've taken offense to this.I would definitely avoid this filth."
2,Black and White?!,I have seen the movie before and it is wonderful but the dubious source that sent it to me sent a black and white copy. BOOO!
2,drawn out,"Starting somewhat promisingly, this movie is drawn out and suffers from that familiar ( far too often) problem of someone trying to transfer a work that was apparently good in some form into film. The resulting product is disappointing. I was left wondering as to the relevance of many scenes, and decided that the whole thing reflected some one's ego trip/ Probably someone in production. The story line is unrealistic and unbelievable, which is so in many movies, but the viewer is never convinced otherwise, as is the job of a good director and/or producer to manage. This movie fails on those accounts and left me bored and wanting it to finish as soon as possible."
2,Way too heavy handed...,"This movie is self-indulgent and overwrought. Let's all bash homophobes and the church. The director couldn't decide if it was a play or a series of memories... It just doesn't work. I'm sure there will be ""art-house"" types that think this movie is profound, but let's face it, some gay movies are just bad. Others are worse--they are self-indulgent. The acting and production are nice, and the leads are gorgeous, so I'll give it two stars..."
2,Hard to stay awake!,"With the current situation with priests in the Catholic church this film shows that it has been on on going problem, as early as 1912. It is one of those films you need to view twice in order to fully understand the story line, which is hard to follow the first time viewed. This film is more for the art film crowd, and is not your typical gay love story theme (as is Broken Hearts Club)."
1,Very average and disappointing,Very much like a TV movie expect the last where there is a small bit of nudity and hugging. It's not that I was looking for a sordid film but there is no point to this film expect that the director is experimenting with a flash-back technique. I don't see why others give so many stars. My conclusion is it's boring and very average in that it does not have anything refreshing expect that the theme of the movie is a gay love.
1,This is a movie?,"This is just about the worst film I have ever watched. The opening scenes were so slowly paced, it was as if the director was attempting to fill space on the DVD. As to the performances? I've seen better acting from kids in middle schools. The actors delivered their lines as if they didn't listen to one another. Flat, boring delivery from almost everyone in the cast, or else they were way over the top and totally unbelievable. The story line did have some promise, but the finished product failed to deliver. There have been some wonderful films introduced during the Gay and Lesbian film festivals, but this sure didn't ring any bells for me."
3,dont waste your money,It arrived on time and it was in great quility and packaged well.I dont know what else to say so best wishes for the New Year!
2,Don't try wearing this for very long!,"This thing is just murderous on your back. Straps are narrow, cheap and uncomforable. Pump handle is balky and stubborn. I use a mix that requires use within a six hour window, which means I need to use up everything in it. Usually takes about an hour of pain to empty this thing, so I'm upgrading to what I hope will be a professional model with better straps and weight distribution."
1,Broke after one season...,This thing broke after one season's very light use (like 3 times). The plastic ring comes off the pump section and the pump comes out and the plunger then gets jammed and damaged. I have to contact the manufacturer and see if I can get replacement parts. I am sure it is now out of warranty.
2,Not what I thought,"This is my fault, but I thought this product was not what I thought it was. They tried to make it clear, but I just thought it was about a DVD concerning the story of the ship Yankee crossing Europe. Instead this is the music from this story, a product I can't imagine anyone wanting. Especially the music from a story about Grizzly bears. I started to listen to it, but never finished it. National Geographic had no DVD's of the original film I saw long ago. Too bad."
2,No Villeneuve vs Arnoux!,"I am extremely disappointed in this DVD. The main reason I bought it was that I wanted a good clean copy of the famous battle between the late Gilles Villeneuve and Rene Arnoux at Dijon. Considered by many as the greatest driver vs driver battle ever in F1 not one bit is shown during the French coverage even though you can get stacks of footage of this moment in various degrees of quality on the internet.Here is a sample of what was left OFF the DVD:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr_6mA8Q2tITo top that off they don't even show three Grand Prix from the season and the commentator constantly confuses drivers Laffite, Depallier, Arnoux, Jabouille, Lauda and Piquet.On the positive side the footage that is shown is good quality, but come on!"
2,Fathers and their importance to the Afro-American family,"In illustrations and various poems, the unique experience of the relationship of children and their fathers is portrayed. Black fathers are like any other father, through the eyes of their children they are ten feet tall."
1,Does not even have the years of production correct!!,"I had read a short discription of the book stating that Panheadswere produced until 1964 according to the author. My good friend,Bob Pickersgill rides a 1965(!) Panhead every day in the summer.Field should get his facts together BEFORE publishing a book."
1,HAAAAATED IT!!!!,"I LOVE reading books by black authors because as a black person you like to read about people that you can relate to. But I felt like this was a white book that someone just deleted out the description of a white person and replaced the description to say brown skin. If that was what I was looking for then that was what I would have made it my business to buy. The coveris deceitful don't believe the hype it was made to remind you of ""No More Playas"" or ""Mr Satisfaction"". Ms Alexis please pick up some of Ms Jacksons books she can really put it down."
1,Are you kidding me...,"Let me first begin by telling you I did not finish the book. I couldn't. I would prefer to go get a root canal than finish. It was torture. I didn't get very far either. So let me tell you the problems I had with the book that made me stop1. The language - The character language did not fit the characters. There narrative was plain and unimaginative. Overall the dialogue was tedious2. Inconsistency - There was a scene at the airport that would have never happened, post 9/11. In fact, I had to double check the copyright to make sure it wasn't an old book I was reading.3. No depth - The characters were just there4. Boring - It was simply a drag to get from one word to the next"
4,A lost album,"Not many folks give CSN much credit for this album. Lost hippie cred writing into the 90s? No mega-classics? Aging voices? Despite these issues, the album isn't really that bad. They carry their protest through the decade of greed, and the first two songs: Live it Up and If Anybody Had a Heart are both worthy of their prior panthenon of art."
4,fickle fickle fans,I find the more i listen to CSN the better i Like it it is now 1969 it is now 2001. Give em a break Steve is one of the most talented guitarists period. Their songs are good their harmonies excellent .Give them a break. Find the cost of freedom...............
2,The Only CSN Album To Avoid,"Being a CSN (and sometimes Y) fan, I bought this CD when it first came out. I wish I hadn't. It seems as if CSN didn't put any effort into recording it, and that they were more interested in making a ""90s"" record than a CSN record. It isn't a total waste though. Stills' ""Haven't We Lost Enough"" and Crosby's ""Yours and Mine"" could fit on any CSN record. It's better just to skip the rest."
1,"yes,the cover does say it all.","simply the worst album ever recorded by a respectable artist!believe me i'v tried to like this,but all in vain,it stinks!"
1,The cover says it all,"This is a real weiner. Peeeeeyew! Hard to believe what these guys once stood for. They should have stuck with live releases during this period because they tended to weed out the [junk] (and this is all scrapple here, folks) and rework what might be of value. But since they put this out, do whatever you can to avoid it. I still shake my head. Geez o man, this just goes to show you what drugs and booze will do to you."
1,The Worst Ever,"What were Crosby, Stills, and Nash thinking? This is awful record. As another review has mentioned, they were only supposed to be releasing live discs and such at this time. It was 1990 and they released this barfbag of an album. It is made under the influence of drugs, alcohol, and constipation. Need I go on?"
2,"Not awful, but...","A complete mis-step by the boys. Some of the tunes are creative and different, but none of them are particularly memorable. Get the incredibly underrated ""After The Storm,"" which is the CSN CLASSIC that no one has heard."
2,Mistaken Identity?,"This music is from the same guys who brought you ""Find The Cost Of Freedom"", ""Almost Cut My Hair"", ""Teach Your Children"", and ""Carry On""? Must have been someone else."
2,Live It Up,"Being a CSN fan from the beginning this album is certainly not their best work, but it is still worthy of inclusion in any CSN collection. David Crosby's ""Arrows"" is the highlight of this album for me. ""Arrows is truly an underrated song!"
3,"Works, But expensive for what you get.","ProsSmall Great for small projects & beads4 Pin Vice sizes - Great for other toolsConsNo instructions on Pin ViceDescription says 12 Bead Reamers but it only Comes with 10, all of which are the same size.Expensive for what you getTip:The Pin Vice has two heads on each end. In order to fit the Bead Reamer heads I had to check all four to find one that fit. It is a tight fit so use a Little pressure to put it. Put it back in vice & then replace the mounting screw to keep it in place.This will do for what I am using it for in jewelry making."
3,Good review questions,"Book has great questions? Sadly, mine was a used copy and fully written in so useless to me but a good book if you bought new."
1,Psych book,"good book in good shape, fast shipping, but it is the 2nd edition and the add was for the 4th edition. that is dissapointing and decieving."
5,Perfect,"husband is very happy with the jersey. fits great, is exactly what he wanted. He loves it and always wants to wear it!"
5,The Teacher Who Wouldn't Retire,"A fabulous book about a teacher who loves her students so much that even after she is forced to retire, she comes back in disguise each day to check up on her students...perfect for a much loved teacher's Xmas or Teacher's Day present..."
2,cute but silly,"I bought this hoping I could read it at a teacher's retirement party. It was pretty silly but to me not in a fun silly way, just kind of lame. Sorry"
2,Quality control was missing.............,"Defective 22 cal arbor...semi half spring at front of arbor broken .. everything else seemed O.K. But returned it as defective, couldn't sight in my 22 cal rifle...."
3,on the paper,"this item will get you on the paper, but improvements could be made to hold it more secdurely in the bore. this item move at the slightest movement of the weapon you are bore sighting, but it will get you on the paper.jt"
2,not really a book,"This is more an article than a book. Although it gives some useful advice on how to tackle the task of playing competetive tennis, I do not think is worth buying it."
3,Very solid gore/thrash,"Funny how someone is complaining that this CD is too slow, because I think it's too fast, and welcome the slow parts. The guitar sound is PERFECT...I love the jagged feel of them - perfect production! There's a lot of good on this CD, but the problem I guess is that it's just good, not great...so I can't give it a higher rating.Live, this band would probably kick some major a**. And when you're in a hateful murderous mood, this is a great CD to listen to...but I just don't think they have enough groove to keep me coming back for more too often (Unlike Carnal Forge). Still..if you're into extreme music, this is a good buy - I dig the sampled parts of people screaming. Haha...very cool. And the beginning into to Razor Jack is almost worth the price of the CD alone.All in all...a very good CD...3.5 stars. They sound a lot like Kataklsm on steroids - which is a good thing. :-)"
3,Epixor Reel Review,"I own this reel and I loved it because it was light and smooth. I took very, very good care of it by rinsing it after every use and had it serviced twice a year. It just broke yesterday. :( The gears were making a funny clicking noise and would get stuck at times while retrieving. I opened it up and found the gears had two teeth worn down and the main shaft would not go up and down. Sadly I had to take out back and shoot it. For a moderate price this is a good reel but it did not last as long as I had wanted it to. I had it for 2-1/2 years."
2,terrible book from a good author,"Bram has done much better than this insipid, lazy exercise. Comedy? Not very funny. Satire? Not very insightful. Just a writer going through the motions with shallow characterization and painfully obvious plot devices. Readble, but not much more than that."
3,Tales of the City for Theatre Buffs,"The best way I know how to describe this frothy, light comedy is to say it's ""Tales of the City"" set in the New York theatre scene. The book runs just a little over the course of a week, with the various characters interconnected, and each chapter moving from one to the next. There's Henry, the older English thespian who's in a smash Broadway play, his love denied assistant Jessie, and her playwright brother Caleb, as well as Caleb's shallow lover Toby. For anyone who has spent time in the Manhattan theatre world or follows it closely, you may find this a fun, campy, nearly melodramatic read. It didn't seem like the same author who had written the fantastic ""Dr August"" and ""Father of Frankenstein"" since it has none of the depth of either of those books. However taken separately, it's a breezy read that brims with heart as a valentine to the the New York theatre and it's inhabitants."
5,Fabulous novel,"Lives of the Circus Animals is the Lambda Literary Award winning novel by Christopher Bram. I have enjoyed several of Bram's novels, including Father of Frankenstein and Gossip. This novel is reminiscent of an Altman film- a patchwork of characters interrelated, as observed in shifting first person narration and told across seven eventful days in New York.The novel mostly centers around theatre folk - people whose lives are lived on stage, in some form or another. Several of the characters are actors (to varying levels of success), there is a writer, a critic, and crazed family members.A great read - Bram is an excellent writer, and this book is enjoyable from first to last."
4,brings a lost world to life,"This is a complex and well written novel. Set at the end of the T'ang dynasty (AD738)in China it shows how the dynasty fell. Virtually all the charcters in the novel are based on historical people and the society as laid out in the novel is obviously based on a lot of research. It involves death, deception, loyalty and dishonour - and the founding of Korea as a penal state for political dissidents. (shades of Australia!)This is not a quick book to read (it's quite big at 920 pages). However at the end you marvel at the author's ability to portray so well a world so long gone. Esecially when you consider that the authors are from ""the west"" and not China."
2,Dissapointing,"'The Mist' has a potentially exciting story but it is marred by how the story is told.The novel is written to make you feel that you are there at the Captain's Table. So, you'll find the novel switching back and forth between the story and the scenes at the bar (such as Sisko stopping to enjoy his Jambalaya). I find that the scenes just get in the way of the story and gets irritating at times.If you want a better book in the series, go for ""The Captain's Table : Once Burned"" by Peter David. It's a lot better than this one..."
2,There's a good story in here somewhere,"If you can get past the fact that the focus of the action changes on an almost page by page basis (from Sisko's story to the bar to his story to the bar), there's really a good story in here screaming to get out. However, it's quickly lost in Trek cliches and some weak prose. Sisko's reactions are good and the idea that the story is set during season four is a nice touch. But how many times do the authors have to remind us of that? Once is enough, thank you.Beyond that, the shifting, which is amsuing at first, wears thing quickly and causes you to lose track of what exactly is going on in the action. If they'd confined the bar comments to the beginning or end of chapters it would make a whole lot more sense."
3,"Functional, but with annoying bits","This toaster oven works just fine, but I wish I'd gotten a different one for a couple of reasons. First: the ticking. When toasting something, the timer makes a ticking sound, comparable to an egg timer. Second: just to toast some bread, you have to use all three knobs. It's like launching a space ship. If these aren't deal-breakers for you, then this toaster oven should be fine. But after years of having a silent, one-dial toaster oven, this just seems like a silly design to me."
2,Convection oven,"I bought this in February of 2011. It worked fine but the words started to wear off and you couldn't tell what setting you were using. I complained and they sent a whole new oven! That was OK, but now, barely a year later, just out of warranty, the elements for toasting and other baking are not working at all. I'm not at all satisfied with this. Since it's no longer under warranty, I'm out of luck."
1,terrible & dangerous discontinued refurburshied,"I received this toaster oven in a very large box. after opening I realized the oven was in a hamilton Beach box that was all scratched up. Since most of my Amazon experiences have been a positive I figured on giving it a shot. At this point I was disappointed with the finish (blemishes). I then used this system to contact the supplier, who never got back to me. After a 2 week wait I decided to try to use it with the very vague instructions that constantly tells you to unplug after use. I saw and see why! The timer is only 15 min. the clicking doesn't bother me,but having to move this very hot & heavy oven from the electric outlet. It is not easy to maneuver. The only thing good thing about this oven was the low price. Not worth the headaches. Don't do business with this merchant."
3,Toaster oven OK but slow,"Toaster oven OK but slow. Takes more than 5 minutes to brown a pair of toast. Otherwise, it is ok."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Yes, you get what you pay for. In my case I was still ripped off. Very cheaply made. It's flimsy and very noisy, especially the convection. I use the convection because everything takes twice as much time to cook than in my old toaster oven. Also, much of the time, the door gets stuck about 1/3 of the way opening it and I must use force to continue opening. Lesson learned. I am now shopping for a quality toaster oven. SAVE YOUR MONEY! *******HERE I AM 8 MONTHS LATER LOOKING FOR A NEW TOASTER-OVEN. It died. the elements no longer heat up. GARBAGE!"
4,don't know,"I really don't know how this is working, we gave it away as a gift. Did not hear anything negative"
2,Same old,"There's no real advantage over a vintage toaster oven. Besides, it's noisy. As always, it takes too long."
4,"Works, but very slowly.",This is a sturdy toaster oven and easy to use. It is quite slow toasting bread. It warmed up frozen leftover lasagne nicely without burning the outside.
2,Not a good administration guide,"When I purchased this book I was in the process of upgrading several Websphere servers from 3.5 to 4.0. I was looking for a book to help understand some of the administrative features of 4.0(security, performance tuning, application troubleshooting). Of the 1000 pages only about 250 are related to administering Websphere. The rest of the book reads more like a Java programming refrence. There is some coverage for administration but not much detail. A good example of this is the Windows installation instructions. The book breezes over the install in two pages. The Linux install is given even less coverage and there is little mention of other platforms. I ended up going back to the IBM Redbooks.If I had to choose of the administration resources currently available I would start with the Redbooks, then the Websphere Application Server Bible and lastly this book."
3,"Poorly Organized, Examples Don't Work","I rarely criticize a text book, but for this one I must make an exception. My biggest complaint is that the examples are full of errors and the procedures are incomplete - leaving out critical steps to make the procedures work. For someone trying to learn Websphere from scratch, this poses an insurmountable obstacle to learning this topic. This indicates to me a rush job putting this book to press and failure to proofread the textbook and failure to test the examples.I could go on, but the shortcomings already expressed are, in my opinion, justification for avoiding this book."
3,Not enough detail,"This book is good at covering a wide range of details, but I wouldn't recommend it for an in-depth knowledge of Websphere, especially if you're a developer."
1,Little bit of everything,I had a very frustrating experience with this book. All I wanted to do was to try install a simple web application with a welcome page and a servlet just to get a feel. But i could not do it easily. The topic of Servlets and JSP is split across many sections with each chapter of 4-5 pages. I would have loved it if all of them had been clubbed together so I could atleast say that I know now everything on servlets. The book has over 40 chapters and tries to cover everything that IBM has to offer. Not for someone wishing to master the WebSphere Application Server. No way. I have used the WebLogic bible before and it was great.
3,"""Good"" sound from one location","I wanted a decent sound system that would not require running any wires to speakers around the room. This unit fit the bill and I'm not disappointed. My biggest gripe so far is that I have been unable (so far) to find a universal remote code for this unit that I can enter into my Comcast remote. I had the same problem with a yamaha receiver I bought last year, but after lots of googling was able to find codes for on/off that worked. So far though no luck with this sound bar."
3,It's not going to replace your 5 or 7 speaker system,"I agree with other reviewers about this product. If you are absolutely pathetic with technology or hate having cords all over the place,this product is for you. It will replicate various surround sound settings. The system sounds better when watching DVDs. The audio portion is so-so when listening to CDs. I have a matching Yamaha subwoofer, but it's basically for an apartment room setup. My old $400 JBL HTIB still blows this system away.Update: I've had this unit for about a year now. It hasn't failed me so reliability is good. It's $150 cheaper now than when I got it last year so it could be a bargain. I just don't think it's worth all the hype that other reviewers have posted here."
3,Mixed emotions,"It sounds better than the TV speakers, but I expected more for the price. We first attached it to our LCD TV in the family room. It is seriously underpowered. At full volume it was not loud enough. Our family room is open to our kitchen and quite large. This needs to be in a small square room to create surround sound experience.So we moved it to our 18 by 18 media room. I have to turn up the volume to max to enjoy the movie. And there are times when I would like to turn it up another notch or two. I would recommend it for an average size bedroom, but not much else.It's too much hassle to return . . . so I will live with it, but I wish I would have paid someone a couple hundred bucks to install wires in the walls and gone with a traditional 5.1 system."
5,What a strange promotion ???,"I like my new sound projector and it really delivers great sound.What I don't get is why does Amazon offer a free iPod dock (Yamaha YDS-10) that is not compatible with this unit? I believe this is misleading and disappointing since nobody would check out beforehand if these two devices are compatible (otherwise, why would you offer it free with the YSP-800????).So, 5 stars for Yamaha and 0 stars for Amazon on this one!"
3,Right room configuration a must.,"I bought this product based on the reviews here and on other sites, and unfortunately it's not working that well for me. Problem is that my room is basically a long rectangle, and the tv and sound bar are set up in the corner. The way my room in configured, I get no surround type sound. Basically I'm stuck with a Stereo + 3 Beam configuration. The sound is not bad, better then my tv, but it's just not worth the money in my situation. However, if you have the right configuration I would definitely recommend.PS. YSP-800 and YSP-900 are the exactly same bars! The only difference is that the YSP-900 supports DTS:Neo6 format, that's it. Everything else is exactly the same. From the DVD's I've watched so far, only 2 had that format available, in addition to Dolby Digital which YSP-800 supports. Considering the price difference between the two, YSP-800 is a no brainer."
5,Most Amazing 3D since Avatar.,"Wow, okay so Final Destination 5 was an outstanding film, was the most visual and action hair-raising movie. Compared to the 4th film it was a huge upgrade, the cast was believable and no corny or cheesy deaths but more brutal and in your face real type of feeling. I would have to say the 5th entry is by far the best at of the previous 4. If you have not seen it in IMAX 3D i truly recommend you do cause you'll have a mind blowing of fun experiance :)"
4,Final Destination 5,"Okay movie, surprised me at the end. Full circle for this movie too. The best is 1 and 2. I am glad I have them all, there is talk of 6, I really do not think so, but one never knows."
2,Rental Movie,"Box indicates this is a rental movie, but I don't see where the description says that any where. It has a big white area with RENTAL stamped on it."
3,Fourth Final Destination Was A Lot Better!!!,"This film despite it was only an 90 minute movie seemed to last forever. The accidents were tame and boring and weren't nearly as intense as the fourth not including the opening scene. So if they make another film they have to do way better than this, because this was a disappointment!"
2,Again...?,"There are two crucial movies in this series: Final Destination (1) and The Final Destination (6). FD 2, 3, 4, and 5 are simply less and less exciting rehashes of #1. They do get progressively bloodier, but also progressively less relevent.Basically, see FD1 and TFD6 in that order, back-to-back. It's one big, exciting ride. Leave out the fluff that is 2-5."
5,One of the best in the franchise!,"I saw this in 3-D in theaters and it was awesome! This was 500% better than the God-awful ""The Final Destination"" which I threw across the floor after watching because it was terrible on so many levels! This one brought life back into the franchise with a breath of fresh air. If you liked the first 3 (and maybe the 4th) than you will no doubt love this one too if not more! I especially loved the ending and how it... well I won't spoil anything..."
4,final des,"This particular final destination movie was a little more close up with the gory accidents that is always forseen at the beginning,but this movie has a good ending even we know how the movie goes."
5,They should have stopped at No. 4,They should have stopped at No. 4. The movie was just too silly to be good. The acting was low budget. The only good parts in the movie were the moments when the people died. This just was not a good movie. I was very disappointed.
1,Where's the 3D?,"The 3D version is what made people go see it at the movie theaters in the first place. It's just no fun in 2D. I will not buy this unless in 3D format and I suspect a lot of people will not either, nor should they."
1,"no 3D, not buying","i'll buy this movie when it comes out in 3D until then.. no way. i really enjoyed seeing it in theaters IN 3D, so until that happens i'm sadly not buying it."
1,Dumbest movie I've seen in a long time,"Bad Effects, bad storyline, just a bunch of people unrealistically getting killed. Horrible. I rented this on amazon, because the trailer looked interesting, but it's not at all."
4,Comes Together at the End,"I guess if you've seen one, you've basically seen them all. Different ways of peoples' demise. This one's premonition starts on a charter bus stuck in traffic on a suspension bridge maintenance project. It was one of the better of the FD flicks. Possibly a bit more gory than others.I thought the ending came together better in this than the other four. Oh, it does leave the door open for 6. Sit back, and enjoy a movie not to be taken seriously"
4,Best Ever!,This was the BEST after the First one. It seems like the same old story plot with the same outcomes but there are some great twists in this one. BUT BEST OF ALL the end will grab you!
1,Rental?,"The Blu-ray disc I received is a Rental copy, and should have been advertised as such (both the box and the disc are labeled with ""Rental""). Disc contains numerous previews/ads that can not be skipped (like a rental copy). I'll keep this one for the time being, then I'll purchase a non-rental copy from another seller."
2,"Disapointing,","The 4th film was labeled ""The Final Destination"" which was supposed to be the final chapter of the series. I admit that when I found out about a new Final Destination film I couldn't wait to watch it and it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me. When I watched it, I was letdown. It wasn't that interesting or entertaining, it was somewhat boring compared to the first 4. It was slow and lacking in suspense that made the first 4 films. It isn't better than The 4th film, not even half as good."
5,Truly Man`s Manly 3D Movie,"Final Destination5 3D for time being is Best buy exclusive.I didn`t watch it in theater as i don`t like blood splattering shots but after investing in 3D equipment at home.I got tired of CG cartoons/IMAX as only option in 3D as so i took leap and bought both Final destination movies in 3D .Final Destination 5 is Pre-equal to Final destination and give some twists and adds bit story into series.Though still some questions left unanswered.They may be addressed in next installment.Opening and closing Credit both are great in 3D.If you use subtitles They look awesome as pop up.Director who is also Assisstant director of AVATAR tried to impress all kinds of audience with depth,pop out and mild blood splatter.If you looking for some great 3D movie as there aren`t many out for time being.Don`t miss it.For 3D its 5/5(If you need to chose one Final Destination movie. I prefer this over Final destination3D)"
1,"BAH, HUMBUG!!","This...movie...sucks!!! I've seen all of them, and trust me, this one is the worst in the series. The actors were pathetic. Were they trying to make this a comedy all of a sudden? Because, according to some of the goofy & unrealistic characters in this movie, I thought I was watching Porky's or something mixed with all the lamest parts of past Final Destination movies. And that equals one bad, baaaad movie. I also disliked the story between the main guy and his girlfriend: very sleepy. Oh, and that ending people are gushing about? SO PREDICTABLE! Anyone who's seen the other FD movies would be able to guess this ending about 10 minutes into the movie. I mean, they mention Paris about 30 times, c'mon people! So, to sum it up: if you skip this movie, you're not skipping much."
2,Terrible Special Effects,Should have stopped the movie franchise at number 3. We have a large screen TV and the poor special effects were obvious.
1,"Nah, didn't go for it","After titles, it got boring way fast, and did I mention predictable? The problem with this series is once you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all and they just get more contrived and unbelievable. The first still the best."
1,Uuugh ....,1 hour 32 minutes I will never get back!Should have spent less on special effects and more on the screen play.
2,A series in decline,"This series is becoming more and more B-movie quality, with a worse plot, acting, and directing. I thought that the first 2 movies in the series were good, especially the 2nd one with AJ Cook. You could argue that 5 is the worst of the bunch with unconconvincing plot details around the death scenes, and also a poor overall story. It lacks the gory charm of the first movies where we wanted to see how somebody received the deep six. The characters are extremely shallow and we never are able to build any connection with them. It leads to a bland plot, bland characters, and a feeling that we need to finish up the movie quickly. I think that this movie is really for only fans of the series. The mnovie is worth seeing if it is free (ie cable) but I certainly would not buy the blu-ray."
2,Final Destination 5,"My husband and son-in-law chose to watch this - dumb story, way too gory for my taste. Characters were uninteresting as well."
1,"ultraviolet, NOT digital copy","1 star just because they didn't include a real digital copy, but a useless UV version and their customer service won't offer a code for a real digital copy version."
5,Great sequel!,A big improvement over The Final Destination. Awesome premonition scene and some really inventive death scenes. I recommend this to any fan of the series.
4,It was...Pretty Good,"Granted it was not as good was the first three, and after the major let down on the fourth, I had expected this one to be bad if not worst than the last one. But surprisingly this one actually delivered valuable entertainment and some pretty awesome and gruesome deaths. I especially enjoyed the ending; Because I did not see twist ending even coming. All in all it was without a doubt far, far, far more cooler and more scarier than that god awful last one they made."
2,Final Destination 5,"If you were a tad bit surprised at the release of yet another Final Destination film, I can't blame you, considering the last installment was titled The Final Destination. Then again, the horror genre is notorious for reviving franchises thought to be dead and buried. No, the real surprise here? That Final Destination 5 actually is the best franchise's films. This time around, a bunch of coworkers are saved from a collapsing bridge when one of them has an eerie premonition, and Death slowly hunts them down, one by one. FD5 is the only film of the series that I would even marginally recomend, and while it's still mostly for established fans, the flashes of dark humor and creative death sequences make it more enjoyable overall. In other words, perfect for new year's celebrations."
4,THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE,I RENTED THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON MOVIE STREAMING SERVICE THE MOVIE WAS THE BEST IN THE FINAL DESTINATION SERIES.I RECOMEND THE MOVIE AND THE AMAZON MOVIE ON DEMAND STREAMING SERVICE
3,I liked this one,I was surprised that I liked this one in the series. I did not find it as cheesy as the others nor did the actors get on my last nerve. They did a good job on this one. I would recommend it.
4,good movie,It was not quite as good as the first but there were some parts that made me jump. How many more?? lol
1,Not so good!,"Pretty dumb movie. The opening credits lasted half the movie. The writing was terrible. The best part was seeing Jacqueline MacInnes-Wood the roccker chick, who died early in the movie.She was HOT! After the first few movies, it's just the same thing and you knew it was comming. Was not worth renting. If you want to spend your 4 dollars smarter, rent Columbiana Very good movie!!!!"
1,avoid ultraviolet digital copies,"Avoid ultraviolet digital copies, they are more trouble than they are worth. Purchase a version without a UV digital copy. Their customer service is terrible."
4,A good selection.,"Some people may carp about missing one poem or the other, I would have liked better cuttings of his Odyssey and Iliad translations, but I know that the editors only had limited space.All of the Pope is needed here for instructional purposes. I really like that the Pastorals are included, because that is the initial Pope, and builds into the rest. You get the Essay on Criticism, a good cutting from the Essay on Man, and the entire Rape of the Lock.In total this collection is really good. I do not agree with all the editors have chosen, but there are comprehensive anthologies out there. For a beginner, or the new student of Pope and neo-classicism, this book is a fine start."
5,For anyone concerned with cooking well,"There is a lot in this book that is not covered in any other book that is regularly available. I had struggled with simple tasks like cutting an onion. With simple and clear pictures and language I now know how to quickly get that perfect dice. It covers preparing all the standard cuts of meat and fish to all types of vegetables. It is the best source outside of Peterson's book on soup for preparing stocks, consommés and broths. This book is filled with all those fundamentals of cooking you just don't get in your average cookbook, and it provides them with clear pictures and language. From how the raft forms during clarification of consommé to a bevy of traditional and modern example recipes. This book is for anyone who wants to learn to cook well."
5,Something for everyone..........,"The Professional Chef is a wonderful resource. It is full of information from basic to more involved,such as kitchen hygiene, basic through complicated techniques, kitchen equipment and wonderful recipes. It is helpful for beginning and experienced cooks, at home or in the industry! The answers to question after question have easily been found in this 1000 page book. The recipes range from basic to advanced, giving you the opportunity to expand your abilities with ease and confidence, at your own pace. To merely think of it as a reference book would be a disservice, it is much more than that , and the big bonus, it is fun!!"
5,Excellent reference,"I purchased this book because it was the required text for a course I was taking. It has proven invaluable not only in class but at home. It is packed with useful information, delicious recipes, easy to follow instructions, colorful photos. I would recommend this book for anyone at any cooking level."
5,An excellent source of reference,"This seventh edition of a Culinary Institute of America classic is an excellent reference guide and source of recipes for the serious chef/cook. Note I said ""serious"" because it is most definitely not intended for the beginning chef or cook. The recipes are written with the intent of providing large quantities of prepared foods and can be quite complex.Ingredients may not be available in all areas and the ""average"" home kitchen will not have all the equipment necessary to produce some of the recipes. That said, the basics of the book including sections on nutrition and ingredients were a more interesting read than I had expected and I learned a great deal. The companion study guide helps to reinforce the information learned.Covering all facets of cooking from sauces to desserts The Professional Chef provides an amazing amount of information in one text."
4,Fantastic instruction but lackluster index,I have found no problems with any of the recipes in the Professional Chef. It is informative and incredibly effective in teaching the most interesting and esoteric of cooking techniques as well as the most banal. My only problem is that it refuses to act as a recipe book inasmuch as it is often impossible to find something in the index. I would recommend this to anyone looking to expand their cooking techniques but would have to recommend the Joy of Cooking original to those who want instruction as well as fantastic and easy to find recipes.
5,"Healthy, Easy, Tasty","Buy this. You will love it.It's near impossible to find a cookbook that isn't packed with recipies calling for butter, bacon, and heavy cream. Many of the options in Bill's Open Kitchen are delicious, diet friendly, and quick. What's more, -every single- recipe comes with a lovely photo of the finished product, so you know in advance what looks appealing.Hooray for food!"
4,Bills Open Kitchen,I spent a month in Sydney and was invited by a friend to brunch at Bill Granger's restuarant. The food was so unbelievably good that it led me to buy his cook book that same day. Unlike other famous cook book's Bill's menu items are actually detailed in his book. The recipees are not difficult and are accompanied by refreshing photos. The recipees are fusion and fresh ingredients from the market are a must. Well worth the purchase!
3,Easy recipes,"One of Bill's signature is always his easy to make but impressive recipes. This book is great if you're a new cook and want to learn some tips on jazzing up your dish using basic ingredients. Uses ingredients from all over the world, thus providing the cook lots of variety and ideas.My only grouse is that if you have one of Bill's other book already, this one is not much different from the other, only a twist of dressing or sauce or different ingredient to make up another version of a dish."
2,First Warning,"Acorna's daughter, Khorii finds a derelict space ship adrift, with its crew dead of some terrible plague. Together with her foster brother, the android Elviz and a variety of other close companions, she must try to find a way to cure the disease before it spreads farther. As the unicorn girl is one of the few unaffected by it, it is up to her to cure the disease and discover who the bioterrorists are, lest her own parents fall ill.** Though the first book in a series, if you haven't the background of the related prior series to go on, you'll be lost. Basically, this is Moreta set in a different enviroment, and really is not either author's best work. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
4,Satisfied Shopper,"Book was in good condition, the library stickers were easy enough to remove, so no problems. My wife is enjoying the gift. Very satisfied with the product and the seller."
2,Not for me,"I fell upon this book at my LL looking for fiction related to plague.I did not know it was YA up front, so the simplistic narrative really bothered me.Then I thought more about it. Should authors dumb down, or use a preachy approach because they are writig for kids?I think not. Some of my all time favorite books were written for kids, but I didn't necessarily feel like they were.My expectations of being swept up into a new world that would stretch my imagination? No, I was just annoyed by it. I had to swallow too fast too many details that happened before the story. Plus, I could never picture the cute little pink haired girl on the cover enjoying a graze in a field somewhere. Too weird!"
3,it was different...,"It put a different view on things considering the teenagers tried blackmailing the killer to killing an exfriend. However, the movie focused alot on the kids relationships which got tired considering the girl was rather torn between the guys and also alot on the kids alcohol usage which again got rather old when you are wanting the story line to progress. The killer was somewhat lackluster but he did have an odd humor about him. It was ok but not something I would sit through again with slow pacing and lackluster acting."
4,It Takes Place in Australia,"The film producers, writers, etc., really enjoyed making this film (I watched the commentary to be able to better understand the film)--and so I shall be kinder than I might have been in reviewing it.It's not that I like films to give me everything on a silver platter, but it wasn't easy to follow the story for me. Several unhappy youths and a dark secret that you can probably guess, although the maze you will have to work through is harder than it might have been. The real secret of the film might escape you--which is why I watched the commentary, where it is all explained in a round table of discussion by the film producers.It's a unique story and could have been presented in an easier narrative and action sequence, at least for my part. On second viewing, I enjoyed it more."
1,Not a movie for most,"I tried to watch this last night and I would not recommend anyone else to watch it,I turned it off before it was even over.The reason being is it felt like a sadistic pedophile was making the movie.If that makes you want to watch it then the movie is for you but, if it doesn't then you know its definitely not for you."
4,A well kept secret,"I found most of the selections to be very enjoyable. Slow, soothing and some faster toons also. Tugs at your heart strings."
2,Useful for travelling or advanced scholars,"Concise it certainly is. The small paperback book contains little extraneous information--however helpful it might have been--and its verb forms seem to be sadly lacking. Were the shortage of information the only problem, I might still recommend the book with only a few reservations; however, the devanaagarii script is so small and smudgy that at times it's difficult to even make out what a particular word is supposed to be. For travelling scholars or those who only need a small reference for reminder's sake, this might be a good, inexpensive pick. However, for beginners a more comprehensive and comprehendable dictionary would be a good choice."
4,Reasonably Good Tool,"Excellent dictionary. Very comprehensive. My only complaint is the size of the type, which, at times, blurs Sanskrit characters. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it as a part of any Sanskrit scholar's library."
2,A few caveats,"Let me make clear what is so concise about this book. For one thing, it is exclusively Sanskrit-to-English; there is no English-to-Sanskrit section. For another, the Sanskrit words are written only in Devanagari script, without Roman transliteration. There isn't even a reference key provided. Because of this, I would recommend this book only if you are already familiar with Sanskrit and just want a reference that will fit in your pocket. Otherwise, you might want to find something else, although I'm not aware of many other choices."
3,"Some cheap, but important components.","Overall these mounts were acceptable. The ends that receive the hex set screws are made of plastic, not steel, so they collapse if you tighten the screw tight enough to hold the speakers in place."
4,Great mounting bracket for Home speakers,"Great mounting bracket for Home speakers. I have a 5.1 Infitinity Home theater system ceiling mounted with them. The screw used to achieve the proper angle can become stripped out easily, so be careful."
2,I sent them back,"I sent the brackets back. They would not have worked with the speakers that came with my Home Theatre System. I tried, but they didn't work out. I also wanted to mount them on a brick wall. I ended up sending them back and using the floor mounts that came with the Home Theatre System. I should have known."
2,Not what I was Looking For,Did not eggzactly fit my needs. I did not like how the speakers protruded from the wall. Not the setup I envioned. I winded up just using a nail to hang the speakers flush against the wall.
2,"can,t use with my home theater system","I purchased this sanus wms5B thinking to instal the speakers of my HTS onkyo-3300.Even I called the sanus customer service to confirm whether I can use these mounts with my system.They said they can be used using the instructions fig 1 B. But when I tried the instructions,I can't be able to use the mounts.Now they are useless to me.The sanus directions are wrong and misleading."
4,decent product,Was not that hard to do. This is my first time installing speakers on the walls so it took me a few hours to get 4 up but i had a free saturday afternoon. The speakers im using areOnkyo HT-S3200 5.1-Channel Home Entertainment Receiver/Speaker Package
2,I would spend more to get better quality,I rated these lower because the components are just not engineered to support the weight of the speakers. I tightened the arm lock as much as it would go and my speakers still made them sag. My speakers were below the weight limit listed in the specs on the packaging for these mounts.
2,Don't hold rated weight,"According to the manufacturer's site these are supposed to hold speakers up to 8 pounds. I have the Energy Take Classic speakers that weigh in at 2.9 pounds and they caused these mounts to sag when wall mounted. If I would have been ceiling mounting them it may have supported the weight, but since I needed to wall mount my speakers I returned them. They just didn't meet my needs. I ended up getting the Philips 5-piece Speaker brackets (PN: SQB1131/17) locally and although I had to go to the hardware store for screws, they hold my speakers really well."
4,Good mounts - BUT,"These mounts are very versatile and seem to come with a WIDE variety of mounting hardware that make them extremely universal. I am using them with the Onkyo S5200 7.1 system and they hold the satellite speakers fairly well. I would say those satellites are between 3 and 5 pounds. The mounts are easy to install and again come with a lot of screws, nuts, bolts, anchors etc. which is good for this type of project. The ONLY thing i can say is i wish they were a LITTLE more sturdy, as there seems to be a slight bit of sag with the weight of the speakers, but overall these are great."
1,Not helpful at all for me,"This book may cover some areas for the Rav4 but, as for me and mine, no. My issue was with the exaust systems and the front and rear catalytic convertors. It has no diagrams of the exaust system nor does it even mention the fact that there are two cats. You're better off just typing key words in the search engine (i.e. google, yahoo, opera, safari) like 97 rav4 exaust system images and go from there...This book was a waste for me. In many other areas I could see its uselessness as well. I cant help but notice it also didnt help the other reviewer either."
2,Important information missing,"On the surface this seemed like a good buy, but we were looking to see the wheel breakdown (bearings? spindles? etc...) These were not included. What's up with that?!"
1,Horrible..,I should have read Sandy's review above before paying to see this terrible movie. Not even all the cute guys in underwear could save this movie. If anyone had said Adam one more time I would have thrown my laptop.Don't waste any time or money on this one.
4,"Two great songs, several decent ones","Thank goodness for the Internet. I had this on tape years ago (the word ""tape"" should clue you in as to how long it's been), but I've since lost it and I couldn't remember anything about the album other than the name of the song ""Written All Over Your Face."" (The only reason I probably remembered this is because it's mentioned by A Tribe Called Quest on their best album, The Low End Theory.) Anyway, ""Written All Over Your Face"" and ""Heaven"" are two of the sweetest, most upbeat songs you'll ever hear. They always make me smile. The vocal harmonizing is outstanding and the rhythm is nice - mellow but still enough to make you tap your feet. I don't remember much else about the rest of the album but I'm going to buy it now just for its two great songs."
3,Rude Boys Are Soulfully Decent,"I purchased this CD mainly for the song ""Written All Over Your Face"" and was enlightened by other songs on the CD. While I won't say it's a must have, I will say that if lookin' for some slammin' sounds, this CD won't disappoint."
2,Not What you think,"The Item says it is a set of 28 tools, when in fact it is 5 separate sets of tools, with several duplications of tools between them. The tools seem to be sturdy and fine, but the listing is a misrepresentation of what you are getting. This sellers has bundled 5 sets of similar tools together and lists it as a set of 28. It is not. I would buy smaller individual sets and save yourself some money"
3,Introductory information about hypnosis,"A good all around introduction to hypnotism, including how to induce hypnotism, its use to overcome problems, its curative powers in this import from Great Britain."
4,Beyond my expectations,"After reading a couple other reviews I was not expecting a lot from this camera. I was pleasantly surprised when I got it. It's easy to use. It installs flawlessly in W98SE. The photos are actually quite good. It doesn't have a flash, so don't expect to take photos in low light. The software that comes with it is very nice. I actually unpacked this camera and had pictures on my computer in about five minutes. If you don't have a quick, convenient way to get photos into your computer this is an excellant low-priced option. It does do a short video clip also, which astounds me for the price of the camera. This is a great way to get started with digital photos."
2,DIGITAL DILEMMAS!!,"I think this product is true.. you do get what u pay for.. but for the price i payed, you'd think there would be better photo quality! and simple directions for the codes to take the darn photo! what a hassle, and a letdown this camera is. The mode button is kinda easy once you figure it out, but no way to set your own resolution.,.. so the photos come out Very hazy. even with the software,its aweful.If you dont hold the camera at a certain angle,slant,straight,PERFECT distance,It Looks Like (...).one photo will come out so-so, the next nothing! the next yucky.. the next..omg! you have to be Right on top of the subject to have it come out somewhat decent. there is No flash, you have to have PERFECT lighting.. such as.. if you take a photo with a little light at your side,or in the FAR distance ..It doesnt come out.. i HATE THIS CAMERA! (...) I RATE IT A 2.. FROM 10.. BECAUSE ONLY THE PRICE IS GOOD, AND ONLY SOME PHOTOS COME OUT ""IFFY"""
4,less for much,Just by buying this camera you have save yourself some money. With this camera you can take pictures and also record a 12 sec. video. It doesn't have an expandable memory but the pictures it takes are fine. The camera doesn't weight a lot so it is easy to cary around. It is also small that it can fith in my pocket. This camera is great I recomend it.
1,cr4p,"this thing is worthless. first off, Amazon 5ux0r5 for not listing the system compatability of this thing. I bought it for my 'mac, and it doesnt work! Plus, it's really flimsy, and it feels like I could crush it with my fist. Blagh. Also, the picture resolution is bad. it's just worthless. Don't spend your money on this."
2,You Get what you pay for,Very easy to use but pictures are so poor quality you can't print them up. Even very small they are bad. . Very fuzzy and blury.
2,"Works as a webcam, not standalone","... The unit would _apparently_ take pictures, but included software always said no pictures in the camera to acquire, and the webcam program showed a black screen then crashed. Tried alternate USB card, reinstall of software, even reinstall of windows (98se), at tech support request, no go.They shipped a replacement. The replacement unit works as a webcam, but still always shows no pictures to download into the acquire program, so its useless away from the computer..."
1,Don't bother - even at [this price!],"If you want pictures that are a fairly legible, not grainy and washed out, move on. If you want to snap photos indoors in medium to low light, move on. It doesn' t have a flash. It offers no forgiveness...."
1,Do not waste your money,"This camera is a complete piece of junk. You get what you pay for, plain and simple. When you spend the same amount of money on a digital camera that you'd spend on a hair cut well... I wouldn't even sell this thing on eBay."
5,A very enjoyable and highly informative atlas,"This book was a joy to read, a great addition to my ancient culture and metaphysical library. I read it just before going to southern Mexico for 2 weeks,it was the perfect Mesoamerica primer for me. Beautiful book !"
3,Not bad - but buy the Hungaroton instead,"This is a cheap way to get to know this wonderful opera - one of the most performed of its era and now largely neglected - but ultimately it's a false economy to buy this if you can lay your hands on the other studio recording conducted by Adam Fischer and featuring a galaxy of Hungarian stars plus the eminent German tenor Siegfried Jerusalem. The women are good in this American recording of a live performance but the sound is often patchy, the coughing fearsome and the tenor several sizes too small of voice for the role. The music is wonderful: exotic, lush, dramatic, with echoes of late Verdi and Wagner. But go for the Hungaroton."
2,false bargain,"a cheap but third rate recording of a great neglected opera.Go out of your way and find the Hungariton recording with Siegfried Jerusalem. Arley Reese is a disaster in the tenor role which features Caruso's favorite aria "" The Magic Tone."" Strange as it may seem now, this opera was the most performed work at the Metropolitan Opera in the 19th Century, and its a shame to buy such a poor rendition as this"
4,Real life in the San Joaquin Valley,Steve Lattimore's stories of life in the SJV read like a modern Merle Haggard tune. All the foggy fecundity of the Valley intertwined with the lives of Lattimore's characters. A thoughtful and well written collection. Lattimore could make some King-Hell movies.
4,A Bold Satire With A Solid Introduction In This Edition,The Praise Of Folly skewers institutions and culture in a way that must have been astounding in the late 15th and early 16th century when it was written and first read. Erasmus was embraced by the secular and religious authorities regardless of his writing. The genius of his approach in the age of the court jester who could say things to powerful people that no one else dare was to use the person of Folly in much the same way as the narrator of this satire of the world around him. This particular edition is very special because it also has a wonderful introduction to Erasmus' life and work by the author Hendrick Willen Van Loon who was a Dutch-American writer in the mid 20th century. His brief and amusing introduction places Erasmus firmly within context and does so with humor and insight into his relevance to his contemporaries. I stumbled on this in a used book shop and thoroughly enjoyed it.
3,A Modest Satire,"Praise of Folly is what it was intended to be, a modest satire, not a masterwork. Erasmus was an interesting and accomplished man - one of the lights of his age. However, this work, written, basically, on a lark for his good friend, Thomas More, is a little difficult for the modern reader but is still, at times, quite humorous. Unlike the work of Jonathon Swift (many years later) there's little reason to read this unless you're a student of the period."
2,Are we speaking of the same book?,"Don't get me wrong. I am as big a fan of this particular genre as they come, and an award-winning media professional. It was based on these fine reviews that I rushed out to purchase this book. While his writing craft is alive and well, the author repeatedly asks us to suspend our disbelief near the end, in order to further several key story twists. Can you imagine this happening in The Maltese Falcon, for example? Then, we are handed a reverse Deus Ex Machina ending that is totally out of character with the protagonist (if you care to call this unshapen character that). Believe me when I tell you that I was extremely disappointed because I wanted to like this book. But it is a real stretch to compare this story to Fargo or A Simple Plan. Ice alone does not a good read make!"
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"The author tries to shock you with a lot of disgusting language and characters, but he simply bores you with a terrible plot that follows a drunken drug pusher through multiple killings in a snowstorm. If I could give this book a minus rating, I would."
1,Terrible: Ultimate Cliche Bad Thriller,"Not enough bad things to say. Basically, it's a cliche bad thriller that badly wants to be a bad movie (the kind you see at the $1 theater). The beginning is incredibly slow going. Lots of pointless drunkenness, with unconvincing scenes (like walking over your ex-wife's new furniture with muddy shoes) which I think are supposed to be ""clever"" (according to one of the newspaper reviews). Lackluster writing, zero character development, zero story line, dumb ending. Will make a great fire starter."
2,Greatly Written yet a horrible plot,"This book was written with a great writing style that had the attribute of being very descriptve, yet the plot was gruesome, horrible, and completely disgusting to think about. I wouldnt buy it if I had the choice again."
3,Great start; Better Middle; Weak Ending,"This book nearly lived up to its hype. Darkly funny, suspenseful, and fun to read--until Charlie does something so out of character it leaves me scratching my head. The overly ironic and (as another reviewer here pointed out) deus ex machina ending left me vaguely dissatisfied. I look forward to the author's next book and hope he leaves the O.Henry climax method behind."
2,"i thought that it looked cool, but...","i thought that it looked cool, but...i couldn't get it to download, and now i can't review the photo's on my compact flash card"
4,Sleek Watch,"Wonderful watch, surprisingly fashionable and eye catching. No back-light, however. It's nice to receive compliments from friends, co-workers and strangers."
5,Very nice memories!,I bought this because it remind me of my childhood. Totally worth it! it was exactly what i wanted. Very fun watch.
4,Calculator watch,This is my fourth one. It's the only one that didn't work. The seller said tough. But Amazon made good on the guarantee. Thank you Amazon. Like I said this is my fourth one of these. The only thing I would add is a light and a better band.
2,Its a CHEAP Casio watch,Don't like1) Watch band will brake very soon if removed often2) No back light3) Calendar NOT displayed and hard to get too.4) Battery must be replace by jeweler making it expensive and not worth fixingLike: its CHEAP and has calculator
4,Calculator watch,A good little watch. the price is right. Does a lot and is very durable so far. I like it.
1,why ?,I dont know why I thought a calculator watch costin less than 20 bucks would be of any use and recomend you do not buy this as it is basicly useless except for possibly as a dificult to read watch
2,Mine died last week!,Mine died last week after less than a year of owning it! Thinking it was a simple dead battery I took it in to have the battery replaced; just a day later it died again. I loved that watch!
2,No light bulit in and no detailed date.,I bought this watch a week ago and I was disappointed it didn't have a detailed date. It only showed the actual day. Another thing is there is no light for when you need to look at the time in the dark which is very important to me. I guess it serves me right for not looking and inspecting it before I took the tab off which now I can't return it. If you need a light and detailed date on your next watch DO NOT get this one. You get what you pay for I guess.
3,Under 20 bucks for hardcore nerdiness,"Length:: 0:32 MinsA little video review of the Casio CA 53W digital watch, emphasize the lovely nerdy styling."
2,Good timekeeper,This watch keeps good time but it seems impossible to make use of other features such as date and whether 12 or 12 hour time. Either the instructions are incorrect or there is something wrong with the control buttons. Disappointing.
5,Classic Retro,"Classic geekyness for only $15. This watch is awesome and so is the price. I am a medical professional and I only use this watch at work for simple calculations. Everyone complains about this watch not having a lighted display. Hospitals for the most part are well lit..lol..So this watch fits my needs perfectly. It's only water resistant, NOT WATERPROOF, but it has held up well to my constant handwashing between patients. Go get yourself one."
4,"Item is great, only downfall is that it isn't waterproof.","I love this watch! It's great for everydays use, shopping, calculating grades etc. I love it! I use it everyday, the only thing is that it isn't waterproof. It is water resistant, but not waterproof. Also, when in calculator mode I'm not sure how to turn the sound off. Overall a great item. I love how its old school but also very light and compact compared to the older calculator watches."
2,It looks cheap,When I got this watch for someone for a gift. I felt a shame to give it to the person. I thought it look nice it cheap cheap cheap plastic that look as if I went to the bubble machine and sent 5o cent for this gift don't buy this unless you are very cheap. Or you buying this for a kid in the third or under will be happy
1,Broken,"Does not work. Tried everything. I'm an EE and you'd think I could make the watch work. Even hooking it up to power supplies, wouldn't operate. Well, to me this was a total waste."
4,Good thing,This calculator watch used to be a dream of mine when I was a child.Now I got it! Just like what I think to be.
3,good while it lasted,"it was a good watch while it lasted. unfortunately, the watch just lasted for 2 weeks then it died. so i went to my local watch repair man to get the battery replaced. it worked for a week then it died again. went back to get battery replaced and the repair man told me that there is a part that needs to be replaced that keeps draining the battery quick. the part is more expensive than the watch itself so i just buried it somewhere in my garage."
5,Excellent basic 'work' watch,"The only drawback is no backlight, but typically at work you will have light available.I have went through 2 of these in the last 25 years... replaced the battery in each just once (you need to push down the tab/contact on the edge with a toothpick after changing the battery to restart the watch), and the bands on each twice. I got both of mine at Radio Shack, but they do not sell watches anymore... and I managed to destroy the 2nd one this past weekend clearing brush around my pond. So I'm looking at a DBC310-1 or DBC-150B now... but these watches are an excellent value if you need the time, date, stopwatch and calculator functions constantly available in an inexpensive yet durable and handy package."
4,Pretty Cool!,"I always wanted one of these growing up, and when I saw it on Amazon I knew I had to have it.It's pretty cool, and has dual timing, alarm, calculator.The only con is that it doesn't have a light to tell time when it's dark"
2,No back light?!!,"This watch seems fine, love the geek factor, BUT no back light? How the heck am I supposed to see this thing in the dark or at night?Come on Casio, you can do better than this"
3,Watch the watch,It is what it is. I can not see what time it is unless I have the lights on. It works fine and the price is right.
5,best watch ever,i love my watch. i got it 6 months ago an it works great. i wear it every day and it has never malfunctioned. i love being able to do quick calculations without getting my phone out. i have also used it in math and physics and it has been great.
5,80s retro flare for really cheap,"Like many others that have reviewed, I've known this watch since I was a kid in the 80s. It's amazing Casio still makes this now iconic retro design watch til this day and at a bargain. It's interesting that when I was a kid, there was a plethora of other calculator catches that I considered were cooler than this design so I really never had the urge back then. Now that it's 25 years later, the nostalgic tune of this watch makes it that much more desirable. Remember, back then, it was another watch. Now, it's super cool ;-)Let's face it, you'll probably never use the calculator function, especially since we can just use our mobile phones. And I wish this watch could use an illuminator light. Nonetheless, it's cool. You will get small ego boost from comments this watch will garner. Yeah, it's not you, it's the watch; regardless, you bought it and you're wearing it!You've probably seen it already but there's an epic and I mean epic review of this watch. A must read."
5,Just perfect.,"Practical, not very heavy on the hand, looks cute and very cheap.Also, its a product from a well known company with good reputation of producing watches so its not a Chinese junk. What more do you need?"
4,Great Bargain,"Definitely a good watch to work out with for the price. Have had Casios before that have lasted well over a decade. Love the countdown timer and the stop watch, makes good for timing runs/sprints. Only things I don't like is the beeper is fairly week compared to others I have had in the past. When running in cold weather with a hoodie and a watchcap, I have to wear it outside the sleeves to hear it, especially in traffic. Other than that, it's one of the best watches you can buy for the price.The only downside to this watch is that there is no LED lighting, so you can't utilize the watch in the dark."
4,Nice watch....Needs a light,"I remember being a child in the late 1970's growing up on the east coast in New Jersey and going into Manhattan on the weekends with my Father. I remember seeing the Casio Calculator Watch in all the electronics store's window displays. I remember thinking how cool! I also remember the $99.00 price tag that was on it! I remember thinking ""Holy Cow!"" "" A hundred bucks for a watch?"" I spent about $16.00 on this model and it is well worth it. The calculator is functional unless you have trouble seeing small things. If you have fat fingers forget about it. It has two alarms and they work well. The only problem is it could use a backlight function. Having a digital watch without a backlight is a bit dumb. I thought this one had one but I guess I didn't see that in the description. If you have a flashlight handy in the dark and a free hand to use it well then I guess it's OK. The rest of the watch is good. It is comfortable and and keeps steady time."
4,Great Watch,"Great old school classic digital Casio Calculator watch. I'd rate it 5 stars if it showed the date on the default screen as opposed to having to hit another button and also if it had a light feature. Other than that, great watch!"
5,it made all my dreams come true,"works great - looks great - I opted for the cheapest mode of delivery when I ordered it on a Tuesday night and received the watch on Friday. I live in Portland, OR for what it's worth.Probably the best purchase I ever made."
1,Watch was defective,"Some of the liquid crystals on this watch are not functioning, resulting in numerals and letters that displayed incompletely. No response from seller regarding performing an even exchange for a non-defective watch."
4,Slick little watch,This is a great retro watch. I love the look and the buttons are easy to use despite their small size. My only gripe is that I like big watches and this watch is very thin and looks small on my wrist.
5,Casio Calculator Watch,I have used this watch from Casio for about 20 years. This is my third one of this particular model. I have been completely satisfied. None of the others I have had has ever failed in any manner. I update them as they get scratched or the buttons wear down. My previous one is still operating perfectly and I just wanted to get a spare before the model disappears from the market.
5,Nerd Alert!,Nothing proclaims my inner nerd more than this watch. I like to complete the ensemble with a Star Wars t-shirt and the latest copy of Macworld.
5,My son loved it!,"My son loves the retro Casio Watches, he has two different styles now and wears them all the time. They are a great value."
4,Nice,"my nephew asked for this gift and hope he will like it. For me, it looks nice and the price is good too."
3,buttons?,"some of the buttons on this do not work. That is a total bummer. I bought it to wear with a costume so not a total loss but i thought it was so cool looking that i was going to wear it again, NOPE."
5,Unbelievable 16 years and still running!!!!!!,"I don't why my watch has lasted as long as it has but it refuses to die, it's light-weight, simple and very retro this is my ""every day use” watch and I can't live without it."
5,Its a Casio Classic,"A classic, I purchased this for my fiancé for work, he loves it. Even though he is a human calculator, this still comes in handy."
5,Hggnh,"How does one go about describing this watch, a watch that does everything advertised so perfectly?I've had this fine specimen of a watch for just a measly 8 hours so far, and I can tell this is going to be a beautiful relationship, which hopefully will last the 15+ years that other reviewers have said it will.The buttons are so easy to press, which is surprising, I thought they would be a bit tougher.So far there has been no problems at all.But I will report back in a later time with a followup review."
4,great little watch,"Ah yes, the calculator watch. My father gave this watch to me when I was a wee boy in the 80s. After the battery died, he took it to get it fixed and forgot to give it back. Oh well... Now I have another one! The watch is pretty basic, which is what I wanted. The price was perfect, too. There are only 2 complains I have about it. Firstly, to see the date, you have to push a button. I wish it was just on the primary screen with the time. Secondly, if it's dark, you can't see it. There is no glow feature. Beyond those two items, though, I love it."
5,"Most awesome, multitasking timekeeper in the world!",I have had my Casio Calculator Watch for a couple of years now and it is still doing a fabulous job. I wear it every single day... It comes in handy with calculating tips when dining out and I work in retail so it is always nice to be able to calculate the savings a customer will be making during a sale - it's a deal closer! Another thing that I love about my Casio Calculator Watch is the stopwatch feature. I spend a lot of time in the darkroom developing film and the timer is extremely useful and pretty easy to read under safe lights. The watch has also proven its water-resistance at 5 stars as well and held up amazingly with all the darkroom chemicals.Thank you Casio for such an awesome product... and thank you Santa for such an awesome watch!
4,Good watch! Good Price! But it could use a light,"The watch is great because casio makes great long lasting watches, but it would be nice if it had a light. The other less nicer ones from Wal-Mart have a light. But it is definitely worth the buy if you're a casio watch fan. Nice classic look and endureable too!"
5,no watch will make you look more Geek!,I bought this watch for my daughter who loves all things geek. She loved it and wears it proudly. Nano Nano
5,"Great watch, but no backlight.","Good watch, but no backlight. I'm new to watches so I didn't think of this, but it is great. Nice and flat on my wrist."
3,Functional but doesn't hold up in water,"It is a great watch, and I love vintage style of it, but the water resistance does not hold up in the ocean. I am not talking about taking this scuba diving....the watch short circuited in less than 4 feet of ocean water. Just FYI for those considering buying this item, don't wear it in the ocean. Cheers."
5,.,Great Christmas music. This cd is mostly without words and so is perfect for a happy warm atmospere throughout your house. It is also great to listen to while decorating your Christmas tree.
1,wrong stuff,"Nice rock music, but this is NOT by the New York Symphony, so if you're looking for an instrumental version, this ain't it"
4,"Beautiful,hypnotic,sensuous","Pasolni's third installment in his""Trilogy of Life"" is a beautiful,hypnotic,sensuous art film!A true masterpiece of exotic eros.Filmed in Morroco,it tells severaltales from Sheherazade's ""One Thousand and One Nights"". Also, check out ""TheDecameron"" and ""The Canterbury Tales"".Recommended for adults only,and forlovers of bold,provocative cinema."
2,A DVD zone THEY LIKE IT BUT I DON'T,"I perfectly understand that the cinema of, let's say, Werner Herzog, King Vidor or Andrei Tarkovski, can be described as poetic but I don't think that this adjective is relevant regarding Pasolini's ARABIAN NIGHTS. I didn't find in this movie an ounce of poetry. To present Arab tales in a very realistic manner, with the exception of one or two scenes, is maybe original, perfectly boring but not at all poetic.Furthermore, I'm not specially excited by the presentation of nude teenagers, masculine and feminine, making love in a rather mechanic manner and by the erotic toys shown by Pasolini in his movie. So I strongly advise you to reread or buy a copy of ""A Thousand and One Nights"", a book that has the merit to plounge his reader in an imaginary poetic world and leave ARABIAN NIGHTS to Pasolini's aficionados."
1,Tedious.,"Pasolini directed it, and that should be sufficient warning for any one who has even the faintest idea of his work. Bad cinematography marrs the scenery, mediocre actors drone on in a confused and muddled saga, and one ends the film wondering why any one would want to waste a few precious hours of life watching this film."
1,"If it's dreamlike, then it was a bad dream","Like a National Geographic documentary about this part of the world with scenes of bad acting edited in, all incoherently edited and incompetently filmed. Some of the Italian seems dubbed at times, and the ""sex"" scenes are so unsexy, devoid of any molecule of desire--like a stag film with bad production values. Don't get me started on the scene in the tent with the golden bow and ""arrow""! I paid $8.50 to see this at a theater and walked out 2/3 of the way through. The only bright light is the arresting young actress who plays the doomed Aziza."
4,EMERSON ESSEX IS A WONDERFUL AUTHOR!,"I didn't know what to expect when I got this book, and It took me a little bit of time to actually sit and read it. But once I did, I couldn't put it down. I loved reading everything inside! PLEASE BUY THIS BOOK! AND GIVE IT AS A GIFT! IT'S GREAT! People are always so worried about saying the right thing, doing the right thing, Thinking the right thing! Essex is not afraid to speak HIS MIND, and not let others make him change what he thinks is right.EMERSON ESSEX ROCKS!"
3,Snuck right through the cracks,"When the title song was a hit in the early nineties, everthing was in high gear with Garth and Clint, so this quiet artist wasn't ever noticed.The cd itself is a small masterpiece. Kennedy is a fantastic guitarist and producer.Pick this up if you can, as it has become very rare."
4,What a way to go,I bought the cd for the title song. I was very suprized to find that for the most part the whole cd is pretty good. The title song is still a riot to listen to though.

4,A Famous Story Not Just For Chinese People Now,"The Butterfly Lovers is one of famous Chinese stories. Almost every Chinese knows about this tragic story either by movie, drama, music, or book. In this book, Ms. Fan Dai, the author has really introduced this famous ""Romeo and Julliet"" type of story into Western world. Every detail that describes the Chinese culture, behavior, and society is so real and clear. The feeling is so great that you only have to read it and cry without any visual support, background music or sound effect to re-enforce the scene. No matter how many times I go through the story, I still enjoy every second of it."
3,just as o remembered,"The story is just as I remembered as a child. I wasn't all too impressed with the writing/wording. Sometimes, it's hard to translate from one language to another. Nonetheless, I bought it for nostalgic reason and it served its purpose."
4,Butterfly Lovers,"The book Butterfly Lovers by Fan Dai is the chinese Rome and Juliet. The book had a very catching story line that makes you not want to put the book down. The names are by far the hardest part of this book. Once you get by the names, the book gets very good. I am not the kind of person to read love stories, but this is a book worth reading."
4,Lovers and Friends,"Butterfly Lovers, written by Fan Dai is a tragic love story. The novel is about a girl, Yingtai, who wanted to go to college, but college was prohibited for girls. Yingtai dresses as a man to go to school, and when she got there, she fell in love. Her only problem was that she needed to tell the boy, Shanbo, that she in fact was a girl, and that she loved him. Then, Yingtai went home, only to find out that her father found her a rich guy to marry. Yingtai soon had to make a decision. Would she marry the one she loved, or the man with the wealth?I really enjoyed reading Butterfly Lovers. I liked the novel because after the turn of every page, something new occurred. Butterfly Lovers kept you on your toes; always wondering what was going to happen next. I usually don`t like classic love stories, but the novel gave me a ""new look"" on classic love stories, and my opinion changed. The novel was a pleasure to read."
4,Hopeless Romance,"I am not kid but i did not want to use my e-mail address.Butterfly Lovers by Fan Dai is an excellent book, however, it took me a while to get into the book. At first the book started off slowly, it took a few chapters of reading for me to begin enjoying it. After the few chapters things started to happen more rapidly and I liked it a lot more. Even though I enjoyed the book, the ending sort of caught me off gaurd, it was strange and extremely random.I believe this novel would be good for the hopeless romanitc type of person. It is a book where people would do anything for the one they love, even if it means betraying their families. If you enjoy reading romance novels, you would enjoy Butterfly Lovers."
2,A Disappointment,"While the story is intriguing and fast-paced, Fan Dai's writing disappoints. At several points during the novel, it is obvious that English isn't her native language, and that she has a LOT she needs to improve. In short, I found this a creative novel that still needed a lot of refining. Sometimes the writing was forced and choppy and left the reader wanting a lot more. Advanced readers will be disappointed in this particular novel."
1,not that good,"it may be good for some people, but i definitely did not enjoy this book. this chinese romeo and juliet was just a drag on story. this girl wants to go to school and dresses up like a man for a few years with nobody suspecting a thing. she ends up falling in love with a boy and cannot tell him that she is a man. and if she sleeps with him before she goes home, she has to kill herself."
3,Ornament,"Good quality, but smaller than I was expecting. It's about an inch high. Probably a good ornament size, I was just hoping for a little more."
1,Never got the product,Just a silly item I bought for someone for Christmas and a week after the purchase I'm told by the reseller that it's been discontinued by the manufacturer. So I never got the product. It just makes me wonder - why would you sell something you don't physically have and are these guys just out gathering names for mailing lists or something?
5,What a nice shock!,"Who knew! I'd call this kind of a QOTSA meets the Strokes kind of thing. I had never heard of them and bought the CD on a flyer based on some stuff I read on the internets. I was using the google and thought this might be good. I didn't get it on a big truck, but rather a series of tubes. More accurately I used the tubes to get a big truck to bring it to me. But that's not improtant right now.What is important is how hard this CD rocks! I really like grunge and such and I love the Foo Fighters and QOTHSA. I'm also into The Strokes, White Stripes and that kind of stuff. I'm a rock n roll kinda guy. Well this band kind of plays to both of those styles. I'm really digging it! Best tracks are ""Tough Girl"" and ""Take No Action"". I can listen to TNA over and over. It just rocks!Ok, bit of a thin review, but buy the danged thing!"
2,This isnt the real Open Hand,"This cd is further proof that trustkill records truly does kill their bands such as Hopesfall,Poison the Well, and now Open Hand. Open Hand's first release ""The Dream"" was quite possably the greatest cd ever released. Open Hand was known for there powerfull drum beats, articulate riffs, and amazing vocals. Now they have a sub-standard drummer and guitar riffs that just dont stand out and seem cliche. The only thing good about this cd is that they still have the same vocalist. Not worth the buy especially old fans."
1,because i cant rate it a zero,"This CD sucks. if you have heard what their other cd (the dream) sounds like then you will understand. there are bands out there that as they write new cds their sound changes slightly and it may be better or worse. this cd sounds nothing like the dream. I have heard that the only original member of open hand is the singer. he should have came up with new band name and not tarnish what was Open hand. you may say ""you are living in the past."" well i dont care i want the open hand that came with further seems forever and blew my friggen mind. I want the band that is a staple in my music diet. Not a band that passes its self off for a band that was great."
4,The Story of Wanting A Rainbow,"Oh yes! I wanted a rainbow, too. I drew plenty of them and pasted them on the wall. I cut them out from construction paper, and I made them out of clay. I thought I could catch one using one of these ways. I even tried ""catching"" one with a prism. I found this book when I was in first grade. I just recently discovered it, again last month. Magical..."
5,Really cute story,I bought this for my 6 year old niece to go along with Uncle Milton's Rainbow in My Room for Christmas.
4,Rainow of my own,"I used this book as an attention grabber before starting a 1st grade unit on rainbows/light. It is a very simple book with simple text. The colors are bright in the illustrations. Obviously, the colors of the rainbow are inaccurate. The kids enjoyed the book and enjoyed telling me what they would do if they had a rainbow of their own."
5,cute book,"Very cute book! I got this for my daughter's 7th birthday & she loved it! I got it to go with the ""Uncle Milton Rainbow in My Room"" toy. Reading & rainbows are my daughters favorite things in the world. I couldn't be prouder of my gift selection!"
5,Great book,Very nice book. Goes perfectly with the toy Rainbow in my room by Uncle Milton. It actually puts a pretty rainbow in the childs bedroom!
5,The breakthrough season,"This season was when the X-Files was still on on Fridays, and people (like me) would have watching parties. ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" was like a lightning bolt when it aired. I recall trying to tell a late-arriving friend about the opening to that episode, he was like, ""What??""This is a DVD set must have for those times when you're ill, stuck in a strange house, or it's late at night and want to chill (or for a low-key date). The X-Files was a great show, really ""1990s,"" and you should totally pick up a few of these DVDs."
3,NO JUSTICE,"One of the great hallmarks of The X-Files is its cinematographic quality. Unfortunately the DVDs of the slim-set edition of season 3 fail to deliver the visceral punch the show means to deliver, because of one simple reason: poor picture quality. Interior scenes are marked by pervasive grain and intermittent fuzziness. Outdoor shots fare no better. The beautiful urban and natural scenery of British Columbia, where the show was filmed, is dreadfully marred by grain and fuzz. At least the sound is good--clear two-channel Dolby Digital.But sound alone doesn't cut it. We all know that the crisper the picture, the more quickly and deeply we become absorbed in what we see on our TV screens, forgetting momentarily the real world. Why else are so many people buying high-definition TVs? If you want to own this season's episodes and want a clearer picture as well, then tape the episodes from your cable channel; feel free to use your VCR--you'll still come out ahead in picture quality."
3,"Well done, but frustrating and flawed.","While I like the premise of a guy being able to psychically influence others, what I don't like is that scriptwriters usually, heck, almost always cast these individuals as pschotic killers/evil SOBs. How about a good guy/gal once in a while, folks? Someone who uses their power for good? Anyway, in and of itself, a decent episode but for one flaw, at the end. You shoot someone in the head with a large caliber hand gun at point blank range, they're gonna die, period."
1,Bruckman,"Probably the worst x-files episode I've seen to date. Scully and Mulder were practically supporting actors in this one and did barely any real work. Contrary to most episodes, Scully shows little to no questioning of phenomenon and follows through on one of the least scientifically explainable theories around; fortune/future telling. Very silly episode. Would not recommend at all."
4,used dvd set,"The order came promptly and plays okay, but one of the disks makes a loud noise in between playing the shows."
4,And the sago continues,I have always gotten a kick out out the X-Files. The third season came and watch it almost non-stop. Almost.
5,Great DVD in great condition,"I had no problems with this seller, dvd came fast and was in great condition. Thankyou will buy from you again."
4,A series that keeps you wanting more,I just finished watching Season 3 and can't wait to see Season 4. It's already been shipped but it can't get here soon enough!
4,The Best Three Episodes from the X-Files!,Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'.. War of the Coprophages.. and Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose by the amazing Darin Morgan are found in the third season! This alone was the worth of this purchase.
3,xfiles review,i think the xfiles series is one of the best series that was on tv and i have been collecting the xfiles and season three is one of the best seasons that was made.
2,The X-Files - The Complete Third Season (Slim Set),"The X-Files DVD's are great! If you are an X-Files fan, I highly recommend getting the boxed sets of DVD's from Amazon!"
1,NEW PACKAGING,"Just bought seasons 3 & 4 to ad to our collection and I was at first excited to see a reduced price...The packaging is different, rather than the previous slim sets (as advertised) the packaging is now a thin 6 disc set (which I only found listed on the web page in one place after I went back to look). Same great show, just very disappointed in Amazon and their deceptive web page."
4,No more errors please??,"I just got my X-files season 3, I have just started to watch it, Excellent!!! nostalgia like crazy!!! Upon opening the box set I see an excerpt William Scully speaking to Fox ""Hello, Son ... who is William Scully??!!! ... I would think that someone would have seen this ... after all this time I would hope that someone would know these characters names...?? Please for the sake of this GREAT show try to avoid such errors in the future ... Other than that keep up the good work"
5,Great bargain for the money.,"I have been a fan of The X-Files since the first season, I just add it season three to my DVD collection, my new set is packaged in a slimline jewel case compared to my older box set.This set is at a fantastic price, a great bargain for the money.I highly recommend this collection.I will be buying more.Thank You.Author of, The Passionate Lover,Joe Tango"
3,Not the same as the original season sets.,"This reduced price edition of The X-Files: Season 3 differs from the original not only in packaging but in content.(...)Based on this, Fox and Amazon are misleading its customers in calling this the Collector's Edition as though it were the definitive release of the show, when it actually contains less than the original collector's edition.Otherwise this is a great show -- worth 5 stars -- and this season marks the fruition of the show's writers' incredible potential."
4,Battery Terminal,This item is good but next time I would go to the local store and get a cheaper one that does the same thing.
2,Over Priced,"Hard Drive can burn if left PC left on for long periods, as in most laptops, but this model runs very hot.It is worth no more than $500 due to being an old model.Have had one for the past 2 1/2 years. Get a newer model"
1,Blue Screen restart nightmare,"I've had this computer for about one year. Only one or two blue screens and restarts the first month. Now I average about 4 or 5 per day under heavy usage. I've spent ~$200 trying to fix the problem. Do some research on the internet. You'll find hundreds of people with the same problem. Even so, Toshiba pretends the problem doesn't exist. I will NEVER buy another Toshiba product."
1,ba hum bug,your music samples are not from this cd this is mexican music not the stuff you have as a sample......
2,No Pleasure in Reading This Book,"Let me sum it up for you quickly--the plot has been wonderfully summarized by the other reviewers so I won't recap. Frumpy self-doubting heroine with apparently nothing to offer anyone suddenly and magically becomes pursued by a completely hot male who spends all his time trying to make her feel good about herself, although he's been abused and mistreated for thousands of years by dozens of women because he wouldn't kiss the butt of a powerful magic chick. They finally get together and have hot sex, then La Frump decides he needs to be freed and sets about to do it. It's downright dumb. Read Fantasy Lover by Sherrilynn Kenyon if this one made a bad taste in your brain."
5,I'M A BELIEVER!,"Ms. Showalter had me hooked on page two. Hook, line and sinker! I could not put The Pleasure Slave down. Fast-paced, witty, and hot! Finally, a character I could really lose myself in. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun reading. This book contains a wonderful blend of humor and sexuality. For anyone who has ever doubted that a book could make you laugh out loud or so sexy that you're crossing and uncrossing your legs. Read this book. It made a believer out of me!"
4,Typical Showalter Romance,"Those who know and love Gena Showalter's pretty formulaic romances, will adore this book. Those who don't, probably won'tShowalter's formula goes like this:Lonely awkward and ""fat"" (size 8 at most) virgin meets otherworldly hottie warrior, she coyly resists him, and he teaches her to believe in herself and then whisks her away to wherever he came from. Add one or two tame sex scenes and that's pretty much it.I happen to enjoy Ms. Showalter's books, they're comfy and predictable, like an old sweater. The plots barely vary, but if you're a fan you won't mind. Much. If not, you'll loathe this and every other Showalter title.Simple, right?"
5,I bought this on a whim & boy am I happy I did,"I went to the bookstore to buy a different book, but it wasn't available, so I bought this book just to have something to read. I'm not usually a fan of ""romance"" novels, but I LOVED this one! I had to force myself to put the book down, so I could go to work. I found myself reading the book and laughing out loud at times. I stayed up late one evening just to finish it. I have found a new favorite author--Gena Showalter. I just finished the book a few days ago, is it too soon to re read it?"
5,What a surprise!,"I found this book at a used bookstore and would have never so much as picked it up if it hadn't been written by Gena Showalter. I have read almost everything she has written and I love her books so I decided to give it a chance even though I was prepared for an embarrassingly hokey story. Almost instantly, I was drawn into a great story with a lot of very funny scenes and fell in love with the characters. The story line was not at all what I expected and the depth of the characters made the reader really want them to both get their happy ending. I guess I really shouldn't have judged the book by its cover because what was behind a ridiculous title was a great love story."
4,A Good Read ! !,"This was light, with alot of Humor, and a few HOTTT scenes...I do think it had potential to be better but it was still a very nice book. I read it in 3 sittings. I also enjoyed catching up a little with the people from Stone Prince wich was a GREAT read :)"
2,Didn't work with cats,"I think the device is probably fine for dogs, but it didn't work with cats at all. A simple 'good' and 'bad' sound would be better for cats."
2,great show / not so great dvd,"After watching every episode of Top Gear during lunch breaks over the course of a year, I have achieved the capacity to bore family and friends alike with my enthusiasm.Imagine my surprise when Top Gear 10 was released on DVD. The show deserves DVD release, but not this way. I understand and accept changing the soundtrack - beating copyright laws are akin to burning a wet dog.What I am not clear on is the other editing. Removing 10-15 minutes per episode just does not make sense. The news segments have largely been cut (why?), and it feels like other segments of the show have been shortened.I will echo another reviewer - the video quality is not what we watched on TV, or the interwebs for that matter. It feels brighter (in a bad way) and sharper...in a bad way.If this stuff matters not to you, buy the disc. But do it knowing that you are contributing to mediocrity."
1,In-complete series 10,"Received as B-Day gift, I was expecting to see the Jennifer Saunders segment from episode 7. However, what was there was the edit BBCA version, not the full length BBC version. Other episodes were edited versions as well. Save your money if your want to watch the full Top Gear episodes."
3,"Helen Mirren goes home, but OH those Alpine roads","A somewhat tepid season kickoff. The tri-host dynamic seems strained at first. And Dame Helen Mirren (yes, we ALL adore her) seemed as if she just wanted to go home and be shed of this nonsense. BUT...finding the best driving road in central Europe leads us back to the reason we view ""Top Gear"". Entertaining, and the fine road out of Switzerland and back into northern Italy was for the hosts and this viewer a completely mind boggling WOW! I MUST be reincarnated as a rich man speeding through the Alps in a Lamborghini!"
4,Top Gear Season 10,Jeremy Clarkson is his typical overbearing and rude. But Richard Hammond and James May manage to make up for it.
4,Great season!,"As many of the reviews say, this DVD has many things cut off in all the episodes, such as the News or the Start in a reasonable priced car, or the stig lap times for the cars being reviewed. However, I still liked it very much, I think this is one of the best seasons so far (up to 18), it is very funny and entertaining."
2,"This is an outline, not a book","This is a very thin book, and I use the term ""book"" loosely. It appears to be a hastily-typeset and published collection of terse lecture notes in near-outline form. It doesn't explain microarray data analysis, but is rather more of an annotated listing of statistical methods useful in analyzing microarray data. For the biologist looking for conceptual content, it is nearly useless. It lists a lot of equations without explaining how and why they are used, or under what circumstances. A much better book is Steen Knudsen's A Biologists Guide to Analysis of DNA Microarray Data. Paradoxically, to find Jagota's book useful, you would have to already understand its content. This book might therefore serve as a quick reference for seasoned statisticians who are suddenly tasked with having to work on someone else's microarray project. This serves to show how new the field of microarray data analysis is, and how sorely a good and thorough treatment of the subject is needed."
3,"Good, but not for Winger","Their first album was just awesome. This one, although it had some good tracks and good elements, was not nearly so great.What's good about this album is that it effectively demonstrates that these guys were not rank-and-file dummies. We see that these guys are stepping outside the usual paradigms of the genre, with time changes, key changes, and unusual structures. Nevertheless, most of the material doesn't speak to me. It feels rather blasé, indeed almost boring, in spite of breaking away from established patterns.Still I am a Winger fan. I wish they had had a longer, more prolific career. When people ask me what rock I like, I usually tell them Zeppelin, Floyd, and Winger."
3,A Solid Follow-Up Album,"Winger's ""In the Heart Of The Young"" is a competent follow-up to its self-titled original album. The songs on this CD are in the same vein as the songs on ""Winger"" and have a very similar sound and feel; however, most of the songs on this CD aren't as catchy and the music and lyrics aren't as powerful and as much fun to listen to as the original album was. BUT, there are some outstanding songs on this album, most notably the powerfully emotional ""Miles Away"", one of the best '80s ballads of its kind. Other good songs include ""Rainbow in the Rose"" and the fun, very cool ""You Are the Saint, I Am the Singer"". For fans of Winger or '80s rock fans, this CD is a solid purchase, and with the inclusion of the songs I mentioned above, comes with my recommendation."
3,Three stars for 'Miles Away',"Probably many of you might disagree with me, however note that the 3 stars are not meant for the whole album but to the song titled ""Miles Away"". I was recently introduced to this song since I am a huge power ballad fan espacially during the 80's. I don't like hard rock, honestly I find it annoying! Anyway, ""Miles Away"" is a good song but it pales in comparison to Foreigner's ""I want to know what love is"", Metallica's ""Unforgiven"", Scorpions' ""Still Loving You"", Twisted Sister's ""I Believe In You"", Kingdom Come's ""What Love Can Be"", Steelheart's ""She's gone"", Whitesnake's ""Is this love"" and of course let's not forget Guns N'Roses ""Don't cry/November rain"" and the list is huge...If you're power ballad fan like me, buy the double CD released by Hip-O Records in 2005 titled ""Gold: Power Ballads""."
4,It was good,I enjoyed reading this book but it was difficult to get into the Irish brogue. Nonetheless the content was profound and I found myself often underlining meaningful sentences.
4,Very Good Paint Ideas,"I just bought a new house, my first, and it was very important to me that it look like a showcase. I did plenty of research before I bought any interior decorating books. I even talked to a professional interior designer who gave me some free advice: get what you like. I like this book. It has more faux finishes than I have rooms in my house, so I can repaint in a few years with different styles I've learned about in this book. Some of the finishes are a little too ""cute"" for me, but it is still a book with techniques I've never seen before. I also recommend Recipes for Surfaces, Decorative Paint Finishes Made Simple by Mindy Drucker. Her book is not ""cute"" at all, and together, these books tell you all you need to know about paint finishes."
2,A few ideas - not worth the $$,"There were approximately 10 painiting techniques shown in this book. The content is basically pictures of what other people have done, but I was looking for examples of what to do for my personal situations. For example, if you have, white wood floorboards, or if you have bright sunny rooms. I was also looking for color combinations that they recommended, you will not find that here.This book lacked in explanation of ""what to do if..."" I have textured walls, but liked the looks of the stripes that the book exampled. But for my textured walls, straight lines would not be possible. This book lacks explanation of individual situations..."
4,A useful companion reference,"While missing the colorful photos of many gardening books, this book is a valuable reference guide to use as a companion resource. The list of plants, attributes, dimensions, bloom season, planting time etc... in each section is a quick cheat-sheet when selecting plants. The authors also distinguish between the different conditions in North, Central and South Florida. The only drawback is the reference to plants only by common name without the latin name. Since a plant may be referred to by different common names, not knowing the latin name may leave you wondering, or unable to locate an interesting plant."
2,You can do better,"I'd like to think most Floridians know not to get too exhausted out in the heat and drink lots of water but this book takes the time to spell that out for you. Finding a shady spot for midday gardening is great advice if you have a shade garden, otherwise, you're gardening wherever your plants happen to be. This trivial information really grated on my nerves and is what earned it just two stars.The lack of pictures is a big disadvantage especially when the author decides to use common as opposed to botanical names.I find Home Depot even uses different names from week to week on certain plants and it's impossible to determine just what is being talked about without a botanical reference.The calendar was a little disappointing as that was the main reason for buying this book.I can find something useful in any gardening book so it does have some value, it's just not what I was looking for."
5,Excellent resource for the Florida gardener,"The book is arranged month by month within the plant categories. So, if you don't have some times of plants, then you don't even have to look at the information. But it is very helpful, especially if you have just moved and want to take good care of your new landscape."
4,Month-by-Month Gardening in Florida,Good reference book for those of us who grew up gardening in the Middle Atlantic or more northern states. I purchased it with the Cubbins book on Gardening in Florida. The two books together are an encyclopedia of knowledge on Florida gardening.
2,Save your money.,"The majority of this book is in English. The first rule to learning a foreign language is ""Do not translate!"" It also doesn't seem to be well organized."
4,FOR INTERMEDIATE SPANISH STUDENTS,"I enjoyed SPANISH NOW! Level 2 mostly because of the complete and intense instruction on the various tenses, working its way from the Present Indicative to the Past Anterior. If you have a firm grasp on elementary Spanish, this might be the book for you. SPANISH NOW! Level 2 teaches Spanish optimally by itself, but I've found that this workbook functions even better with a vocabulary handbook, because SPANISH NOW! Level 2 tends to focus more on the grammar and ultimately the verbs. SPANISH NOW! Level 2 is ideal for the beginner or intermediate highschool or college Spanish student, or for those who want to be able to read and write in Spanish. Finally, this book is NOT for those who solely want to become conversational in Spanish, because it focuses on reading and writing ability along with sentence structure."
2,Not for use without a teacher,"I have Kendris' book of verbs and it's a good straight forward resource. The Spanish Now! Series is very common at the large bookstores and I picked it up because unlike most bookstore titles it had a level two book for intermediate students. What I find difficult is that as a bookstore title it really is designed as a textbook for a class room situation; not really surprising given Barrons' business segment. Be that as it may, this makes the book nearly impossible to use for self-study. In every chapter there are examples and exercises where you're supposed to converse with a classmate or listen to what the instructor reads to you. Beyond that, the exercises are repetitive and uninteresting. For self-guided study look elsewhere."
1,Thumbs down,"I like Barron's Spanish products, and LOVED Spanish Now I. In fact, I've recommended it to a number of friends and am buying two more today. So I was very excited to see there was a level II. I bought it, looked through it, but never got beyond the first chapter for working it. BORRRRRING!! The first one was so humorous and made you want to go to the next chapter. This level was the same dry old stuff I've seen in too many other books. Sorry, but I vote it down."
3,Dissapointed !!,"I have been a fan of the jazz guitar since elementary school, and I own a fairly substantial collection that spans several decades. When I first learned of this new release I was very excited.I purchased my copy thru' amazon - almost purchased 4 additional copies for holiday gifts, but the wife stopped me- and started listening to it the moment it arrived.I was impressed with the packaging as well as the layout/background information on the featured players. I was however extremely dissatisfied with the selections. I do not know what the inclusion criteria are for the works that were featured, but almost all the guitarists featured had more wellknown , and in my opinion, better work than that which was highlighted. Larry Carlton, Pat Metheny, George Benson, Phil Upchurch - all these guys had way better stuff that could have been included.Maybe the featured work appeals to Jazz musicians or aficinados, but for a regular listener/customer it falls short."
5,Great overview,"I've had this box set for more than a year now and really enjoy it. It has been a good way to explore many of the jazz guitar masters. I just picked up three CDs from artisits I disovered through this set; Al di Meola, Mike Stern and John McLaughlin. Id covers everything from early innovators through fusion masters."
3,Botany Review,"This book is one for the field botanist, but as far as it's promises of learning 43,000 plants quickly and easily it is misleading. It is a cumbersome process for the amateur field botanist. For the seasoned botanist there are errors that taint the qualifications of the author. That said, it makes a good addition to the well-stocked field botany library. It's approach using families for identification makes it useful."
1,"Disappointing, not correct.","This book could be good, but is riddled with problems when it comes to the botanical facts, spellings, and the information is not up-to-date."
4,"Catchy title, great book.","Botany in a Day seems like a little much for the every day person - how can all that time spent in the classroom be condensed into such a short and easy to read book? Well the answer of course is that it really can't, but this book sure seems to do a great job of giving you what you need, and doing it in a short and concise package. All that said I have to admit I have not had a chance to sit down and do anything but quickly thumb through it and put it on my to read shelf. But hey, I do plan to spend some time with it and expect that it will be some good time."
1,Not very useful,"This is interesting, but not as useful in all parts of the country. Would not buy again."
3,Book for Herbalists,"I am unhappy with this book, as it seems to be most of all geared for a student of herbalism. There is an overly scientific description of how to recognize a plant - and only black and white pictures (I've had to look up every plant online because all the pictures look the same to me). And very little information is written about what make that family or subfamily unique... rather most of the page dedicated to a family is about its medicinal properties... which all seem very general to me. I'd be wary about just self diagnosing yourself and ingesting something. Plants are potent. As for me, I'm returning this."
5,very easy to learn,"I like this book as it makes the subject less intimadating to learn, it breaks down the general subjectin a way that is easier to digest."
5,Good info book,"This book has really helped me to learn to identify my plants & it makes it really easy to do. It is not full of stuff you dont understand it is easy reading & understanding, makes learning your plants fun. I take it everywhere with me especially when I am traveling so that I can identify plants I dont know. Very useful tool if you want to know your plants."
4,Good book,I ordered this book because it was required for my botany class. It is helpful and has good illustrations. I am happy with my purchase.
3,Good...but I'm still new to the genre.,"I've only recently allowed myself to indulge in Industrial noise music...and I'm still not a total fan of the genre. After hearing this album, I found myself longing for lyrics and pop beats. However, there were a few tracks that I liked as they were composed to total rythmic noise perpensity...but IMO, SYNAPSCAPE, MERZBOW, APHEX TWIN and NON are the only perfect Industrial noise bands I have heard thus far...and HYPNOSKULL being the runner up. VROMB is really just a ""bnad"" for dedicated fans to the noise scene..not for eclectic music listeners who only want the verry best from the genres. If your like me, and you seek only the best of each genre...I suggest the other artist I mentioned..this isn't bad, but it's not as cool as those above mentioned."
2,Missing pieces and illustrations,"Arabian Nights is a fantastic book. This Kindle version however, is not a fantastic version of said book. It is missing illustrations and huge sections of the story. There are simply parts of the book that are unintelligible based on the missing section. Do yourself a favor and read the book, just not this version of it."
4,stringing along,I liked the idea of the smoke blue coloration. oF COURSE it had the same quality as the stren High impact line always has.
1,danajo,"Heads up for those of us out there who are low tech. Despite the photo representation of this product it is not a FLAT PANEL, which is a thin monitor. It is a FLAT SCREEN, which has a standard depth. I had purchased this as a gift for my husband and was sorely disappointed when it arrived. I have since returned it and did not get a refund on the shipping as tecnically there was nothing wrong with it. Again, I think the above photo is very deceptive."
1,"Always buy LCD screen displays, for these days.","Don't bother w/ this item. HP monitors are usually no good (Gateway is better), and CRT is really, a thing of the past. Find an LCD display, these days, they don't cost so much. Don't buy the cheapest one, cuz, happiness is just around the corner."
1,"I thought it was a ""thin"" screen..it's huge","I guess I have to admit it's my fault... I should have asked more questions. I too thought it was a ""thin"" flat screen...it's huge. Big mistake!!!"
5,Wiersbe is the best!,"I have many Commentaries by Wiersbe. To me, he is readable, understandable, and easy to follow. Very common senseapproach to life's greatest information!"
3,2 and 1/2 really...,"this is one of the few bruce and stan outlines worth reading. read their, 'guide to bible prophecy' it's much better."
5,Great so far.,"I needed a battery for my Canon EOS 5 (a2e) that takes the 2CR5, and the Kodak battery available here on Amazon went WAY up in price, so I decided to give the panasonic a try.PROS- Currently at 21 rolls with full battery indicator- About half the price of kodak as of 05/2012CONS- These batteries used to last a lot longerMore than likely you can find this battery at CVS or Walgreens for about $12, but if you don't mind waiting a little the $7 savings is absolutely worth it in my opinion! I really feel as though companies are putting less effort into these batteries - they used to last 40-50 rolls, but I haven't had one last past 30, even being kept in the fridge with a decent expiration date.Depending on how many more rolls this lasts, I may be switching from Kodak! I'll update when it finally dies."
4,photo battery,It worked as intended and will buy more off these when necessary to keep a very old Kodak camera working that I gave to my daughter.
3,Great for small speakers,"I bought this to go along with my Onkyo HT-S5200. The front speakers were 6lbs which was well within the 8lb limit on the Sanus specs. It turns out that although it appeared that it held the front speakers, they sagged so much the bottom of the speakers touched the wall. I wasn't convinced that the arm wouldn't snap off within a day or so. I ended up having to use 2 mounts per front speaker to hold the thing in place which worked nicely. That left me with one mount for the rear speakers - only 2.2 lbs and it worked great. Problem is now I've had to buy another single mount for the last rear speaker which was almost as much as the original 5 pack. One thing that did surprise me was that there is no cable management in the speaker mounts. I assumed that the arm would be hollow to allow the wire to be threaded through it so the wall mount for the speaker mount would cover the cable hole."
2,Confused!,"I just cannot continue to read this book. It is dry and boring. The characterizations are very shallow. Further, there are too many characters if you count the wives, girlfriends etc. etc. I find it confusing and hard to read. This is unusual because I like Archer most of the time."
2,british govt. & politics,"this book should only be sold in great britain, or to anyone very familiar with british govt. & politics. the characters are interesting but i would not rec. to anyone except above. so far his other books have been very good."
4,Beware! U.S. v. British Editions,"I write this review having now read both the British and American versions of the book. I found both engrossing and highly readable, but the British version without the Scott, Fraser, and the different plotline for Simon Kerslake to be a superior story. Beware! The American version does not alert you to the rather substantial difference. I would not have bought it knowing now the difference."
3,Pretty good.,Pretty slow moving with far too many characters to keep track of.Only after the first 250 pages did some of the people in the book make sense.
2,I don't know why?,"After reading all the raves, I bought this book. What a disappointment! First, none of the characters had depth, personality or held my interest with the exception of the storeies surrounding Fraser and Kerslake. The plot was thin, or maybe I am just not interested in the innerworkings of British Parliament. However, I read it all, turning each page, waiting for something to happen. Someone tell me what I am missing here."
5,Best written and evolving book Archer has ever written.,"Archer, one of the best story tellers of the day, weaves a tale a three young men growing up in England, all aspiring to the same goal in life - to be the Prime Minister. Archer's nack for blending the characters and sub-characters together throughout their lives is as entertaining as he gets. EXCELLENT first read if you've never read a Jeffrey Archer book. It will definitely hook you on both his writing style and stories. A true classic!"
3,First Among Equals,"It is OK..I like Jeffrey Archer, but this is a slow read. I still haven't finished it. I don't even really care what happens at the end."
2,First among equals,".First among equals is boring,boring and still boring it was just a wonderful feeling to reach the final page.Thanks God it is over this nightmare"
5,Pediatric 1000 Matress,"My 19 yr. Old daughter just gave birth on July 14th, 2005 to my grandson and I have to say the product turned out wonderfully, Jordan sleeps in his crib peacefully and and it fit directly into the crib with no extra space!! so thank you amazon!!"
3,Decent Introduction,"Overall, a decent introduction to playing acoustic guitar. It begins with essential basics, like how to hold the guitar and the pick and how to strum. It then proceeds to show the basic chords and then then the instructor plays and signs the songs (bluegrass standards most of which I'd never heard of:).The entire videotape has a an on-screen timer counter running, handy for reviewing sections later, and there's a companion book which is useful. Its a bit short at 1 hour, I wish it proceeded to show other styles of picking, but for around $10, its a decent introduction for the complete beginner."
5,Hai!,"Really informative. I was actually surprised! Some really nice pictures in the book also. After reading, I now have a thorough understanding of Samurai, warrior monks, japanese warfare, etc."
3,Reports and writing,Lengthy. Covers a lot of information on writing technical reports in an accurate and organized manner. Helpful to those of us who do not write reports on a regular basis. A keeper.
3,Technical Writing : Process and Product (5th Edition),"This book contains plenty of good information on the process of technical writing. It is however very difficult to read, because of the only style is that it is constantly varying. The authors should take some of their own advice in any future editions."
5,Incredible Energy to Traditional Tunes,"This is my new favorite Grateful Dead concert. I lost my tapes years ago, but I've been able to pick up legal soundboard concerts, good concerts thanks to Dick and some local independent music stores.This is an unbelievable concert. I would choose it as one of my favorites for two reasons: Jack Straw and Bertha. Don't get me wrong. I'm mean, St. Stephen..well, yeah. But listen to the crescendo on these two songs. It's a sample. If you had a 14 year old brother who hated the Dead, you would (hopefully not forcefully) make him hear these. It's universal; whereas something like China Doll is more personal.Buy this concert. The power and love tear that old house down."
5,Passionate,"This show is about passion and energy, not subtilty or nuance. Not that there is'nt any delicate playing on this cd but the energy level which the Dead achieve at peak moments is as close to heavy metal as they ever got. Jerry almost loses it when he screams the chorus for ""I Know You Rider"" The band gets so caught up in the energy that they nearly burst apart. I can't imagine what it was like in the audience but I'd hazard to guess that it was an unforgettable if not life changing event. This is one of the most intense sets by the Dead they've ever released and is filled with a fire and passion that warrants their reputation as one of the great rock live acts. The Dead were really feeling their oats during this show, rolling thunder indeed. The extra tracks on CD 3 from the following night are equally as impassioned. Great Dick's Pick, one of the best."
3,Great Performance - OK Sound,"If you read the other reviews, then you already know that this concert is full of energy and heart. The power of this performance is unbelievable, as is the show's history. I give 5 Stars to the content, hands down. However, the quality of the recording, in my opinion, is not as good as most of the other Dick's Picks. Hence, the 3 Stars. The vocals are difficult to hear on many of the tracks, which is the only thing holding this collection back. That being said, was it worth the purchase? You better believe it!"
3,Important Issues,"A former medical researcher and now a historian of medical ethics, I take a position between the two that have been expressed to date. We absolutely must consider the consequences of any new technology, and Rothman explores the possible deeper implications of the human genome-- which has at this point been deciphered. At times, her writing smacks of revised undergraduate lectures with all their attendant hyperbole, but for the most part she presents crucial questions in a clear and readable manner. I would recommend this book to persons who want to think responsibly about genome issues, but with the caveat that they should also read other points of view."
1,Fear of Technology,"Very negative book that exaggerates dangers of a new technology. To demonstrate her exaggeration, turn to page 14 where she states ""Every possible area of basic research has been cut, and cut again, and cut yet again. But genetics gets funded."" Between the books that exaggerate the negative and those which ignore the dangers exist more balanced books. One such book is Lois Wingerson's ""Unnatural Selection: The Promise and Power of Human Gene Research."" Lois correctly points out on page x that ""There are exaggeration and misinformation at both ends of that spectrum--and a wealth of important detail in between, steadfastly overlooked by both sides."" In my opinion, ""Genetic Maps"" represents the pessimistic end of that spectrum, and should be avoided."
2,Not Very Useful,"Compared to the other pocket French book I bought this one was not very helpful. There weren't as many useful phrases and the language was very formal. Any information is helpful if you are starting from square one like I was, but this wasn't the pocket book that I could just whip out and be able to communicate with like the other one was."
5,Amazing Headphones,"I absolutely love these headphones!! I use them everyday to listen to my ipod and they work great! It was definitely a purchase worth while, because the ear hooks change size!"
3,Loved them for 30 minutes,Planned on using my new ear buds to block out distractions with music during hockey try outs. Loved the sound for about 30 minutes when I bumped something and the connection between my Ipod and the buds broke! I don't recall the bump being exceptionally hard but the product broke before I could develop a hard impression. I recall enjoying the sound quality but I really only had the ear buds on for 5-6 songs!
1,AWFUL DESIGN and poor sound,"The earhooks do not fit over the ear and therefore the earbuds do not sit inside the ear. As a result of this complete lack of intelligent design, the sound quality is very poor. I am sorry I purchased these and strongly urge you to NOT purchase these earhooks."
1,Spend your money on something else!,"Recently my old Philips headphones broke on me, and since I loved the old ones which had terrific bass and treble, I decided to buy another Philips set. I was really disappointed from the moment I first wore these. The highs and lows are completely off. It has good treble, but a very weak bass which really makes a lot of songs seem dull. I'm going to throw these out since I lost the bill, seriously they are not worth your money. Either pay a little more and get something better, or pay less for another pair, because these are just horrible. I really believe all these people giving this product a good review, were either paid, or work for Philips."
2,Kept Falling off,My original Apple I POD ear buds were eaten by my dog(can you imagine?)These had a good write up so I bought them. They are lightweight--but so lightweight they kept coming off my ears constantly--now I use the plain ole ear buds.....also the sound was average...
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought these as an alternative to the standard ipod earbuds for my workouts. As previous reviewers complained the fit was awkward and the buds were too big for my ears, which affected the sound (b/c they kept slipping partially out). If I held them in place, the sound seemed fine, although I'm certainly no expert. After 3-4 months, the rubber covering fell off of one of the buds. I can't complain too much, b/c it's so cheap, BUT you certainly are getting exactly what you're paying for with these."
1,Great sound quality but VERY uncomfortable to wear...,I bought these ear buds because the reviews were so good. I only had these for a couple of days before I sent them back!! These hurt the inside of my ear so bad after only 1 use that I couldn't use my cell phone ear piece for 2 days... Replaced them with the Jabra c220
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought these because Runners World picked them in their magazine as a runner friendly device. Turns out they are not good at all!!! The sound was horrible. Remember the string and two cans? Yeah, sounds a bit like that. And they fit fine on one ear, but not at all on the other. I am going to just keep looking."
4,Good Product,These earplugs are perfect for people who do sports. They are a lot better becasue they do not come out of your ears as the regular ones do. The sound quality is good. I really recommend them!
1,Painful for my ears and occassional fell off...,"I bought these ear phones because I accidentally left my other sport headphones at home while I was on vacation for two months. After wearing them on two long runs (5+ miles), my ears hurt too much to run with them or others for two days. Also, they fell off occasionally while running. I don't consider myself to have small ears, but maybe the Phillips brand would disagree. I would not recommend this...upgrade, pay a bit more and buy a different pair."
3,Good sound but so uncomfortable!,"I got these on the recommendation of other runners and I thought having the hooks would avoid the problem I always do with earbuds...they're too big! I started slowly jogging and one side popped right off. Even when they stayed in, they were uncomfortable within a few minutes. I'm well above average height etc for a woman but apparently my ears are WAY too tiny for these to fit. Anyone want some free headphones?"
4,Great sound,Great sound quality. The only problem is the one-size earbud. It is too large to fit comfortably in my ears (I am a medium sized woman) so I gave the earphones to a friend and purchased another brand that had three sizes of earbuds.
3,Painful listening,"My ears are very tiny so the headphones are a little loose around my ears. At first they were very comfortable, but after a couple times running with them they really hurt my eardrums. But as for walking and just statuary listening they are great.If your ears are bigger they will be a great purchase."
3,Good Sound But Poor Fit,"I bought these to make my recent urge to running tolerable. The sound quality is good but, after wearing them during increasingly strenuous runs, I found they slip out of my ears as I sweat. Also, the sound piece, which only comes in one size, is too large for my ear opening. So, don't buy these thinking you can use them during your workout but, they are a fine choice for everyday use."
3,Not for small ears.,"Before I went off to college, I wanted a pair of good headphones I could use as to not bother my roommate when I wanted to listen to music or watch DVDs on my laptop. My sister suggest I get the ear buds with an earhook for comfort, so I purchased these. The sound quality is great, but they are incredibly painful! If you have small ears, or a small earhole, DO NOT BUY THESE! The flexible earhook is very convenient, but the bud is very painful for small ears. I can't wear the headphones for more than 10 minutes."
1,Terrible for running,"I bought these earphones as a replacement for my usual wrap-around-the-back-of-the-head headphones that I work out in. After I began my jog outdoors , I began having difficulties immediately during the first minute. The earphones would constantly begin to loosen its grip on my ear no matter how securely I tried to wrap them around my ear or snugly place the bud inside. It was a very frustrating and disappointing experience for me. I would definitely not recommend this for anyone with ears on the smaller side, let alone use these earphones for running. Even with its reasonable price, I would rather have spent the $13 (including shipping) and put the money towards a pair of earphones that I could actually use during my workouts."
5,The BEST...on second thought,"Forget Sony'These Philips are comfortable but most of all you'll hear details that Sony's lines totally miss. The real deal.EDIT: You hear details not in the Sony that fits sideways in your ear. BUT these Philips havea ""metalic"" sound that make the Sony a better listening experience. I will have to look at Sony's full line.This Philips gets 3 stars."
2,Fit but sound Quality poor,"Finally found earphones that fit in my big ears and stay put but the sound quality is $9.95 sound quality. Don't buy if you are into good sound, particularly bass."
3,this is cute!,"This is so cute, although I haven't had a chance to open it and try it, b/c I bought it as a present. But I believe this will be good."
5,Nice little ear buds that stay on when active.,For the price these are great. My wife uses them so I can't comment either was on the sound although she hasn't complained so I'm sure they are fine.
2,Great idea - not great for all ears,"I bought these to replace the very basic ear buds that came with my iPod. The idea of these seemed perfect, but the actual piece that fits inside the ear (the speaker) is too large for my ear, so it doesn't stay in place. The curls that go around the ear would work perfectly if the speakers stayed in place. So, these might get passed to my husband so I can try another option.The sound quality is just fine."
5,Great headphones!,"These were great headphones!! They fit around my ears very well!! The sound is not AMAZING!! But what do you expect from ear buds? ONE CAUTION!!!! If you have small ears, do not get this! My friend was trying to listen to them and they would not fit around her ears. So, NO SMALL EARS!! Other than that, they work great and they stay on your ear no matter what, even if you are running or boxing, or playing basketball, anything like that, they stay on!"
2,Good sound; Don't Stay On Well,Good sound; Don't Stay On Well. I prefer my wife's blue sony pair (cost the same)
2,"Cheap, quality is okay --- SO UNCOMFORTABLE","PROS:1. Price - very cheap, that is always good2. Color - white is nice3. Length of cord - definitely enough4. Sound quality is decent, nothing super amazingCONS:1. Super uncomfortable - this does not fit over the ear properly, it will stay on for a while, but will eventually fall out, causing you to get irritated from having to put them back in. I move around for work, walking, moving arms (I sort mail), etc. and this thing will not stay put. I'm not even jogging; I could imagine how much worse it would be for those who are. My ears are not oddly shaped, they are actually quite normal, not too big or too small, but these were not built properly.2. Gets dirty faster 'cause it is white."
3,Jim,"This one is perfect for jogging. The noise canceling earphones arenot good for jogging, you will hardly here the noise around you andthat would be problem when jogging on the street. You will want to hear ifcar or bike is accidently going to hit you. The echo of the soud from noise cancelingearphones are also anoying, you can hear you footsteps while you are jogging.This one is inexpensive,got ear hooks so it woon't drop easily, soud quality is acceptable."
5,Comfortable & stays in place,"Having had trouble with the standard issue ipod earbuds during workouts, I bought these with the hope I wouldn't have to constantly readjust them. They were just what I needed; comfortable and stays in place."
2,Not working out,"I bought these to use at the gym, and for running. After inserting them into my iPod, I had to wiggle the connector to get the music to play in both ears. They fit okay, but didn't block out any other sounds from the gym. I can't imagine running with them. They are not connected to my laptop, where I will use them till they no longer work. Would not buy again."
1,"U get what u pay for. Great for a few weeks, then useless","I bought these headphones to replace my iPod earbuds, since I am a runner and needed a more secure fit. At first, these were a dream for the price -- good sound, comfortable, stayed put. However, due to the very flexible design, over not a lot of time (perhaps a month), these lose their elasticity and begin to get looser and looser. Honestly, these flat out fell off of both ears with just a little bit of sweat on many occasions. VERY frustrating, but I guess you get what you pay for.If you plan on vigorous activity, I highly suggest not taking the cheap route like I did and invest in a quality pair with lasting grip and shape."
3,"Great sound quality, but...","they don't fit small ears. The buds are huge, and the flexible earhook is flexible- in that it isn't rigid- but won't keep these in place with the slightest movement. That said, I'm glad they were cheaply priced so I didn't drop a huge amount of $$ into these; and they are perfect for my husband. Bottom line: don't bother with these if you have small ears and already have problems with other buds fitting properly."
2,doesn't fit ear,"These headphones were too big for my ears. I bought them to run with, but they wouldn't stay on, even when I was just standing still."
1,hooks too big for my ears,"The hooks are too tall to fit over my ears and have the ear bud part fit in my ear. I cannot use these. I am an average-sized 30-year old woman. Don't assume these ear clips are ""one-size-fits-all""."
5,balllin,most excellent. i used to use the blue sony headphones but they had hard hooks and made your ears hurt after awhile. these are so comfortable it's like theyre not even there!
5,Great earbud alternative at an ultra-low price!,"I purchased these earphones as a replacement for my ipod's lost earbuds. I'd use them seven days a week and twice on Sundays for several reasons. They're inexpensive; never fall out of your ear because of the earhook, and they sound teriffic. I'd highly recommend these over several higher priced models."
1,Uncomfortable and bad sound,"These are horrible, I have small ears and these keep popping off my head, and hurt to wear. I couldn't get these off my head fast enough."
3,Not what I expected,"This shelf is attractive enough, but not what I expected. It advertises it's ease of hanging with no tools, but that is ONLY if you are hanging it in something soft like paneling or sheetrock. I needed one I could hang on concrete block walls. Ended up having to glue it up. The advertised method didn't look all that easy either once I saw it up close, and it can't be too sturdy hung that way."
1,not what was described,"This was advertised as an instant shelf with no tools needed and it lied. First, this isn't an instant shelf, they are spring loaded. Second, this does require tools, specifically a hammer and level. You have 3 pin type things that have to be hammered into the wall and then you line up these pegs with drilled holes in the back. Doean't seem very sturdy to just ""pop"" it in vs made in the unit. I cut a corner piece of wood, drillrd holes and inserted tack nails at 3 points, glued them in and painted it. I have the exact same style corner shelf from what I found lying in my garage and I know its more sturdy because of how I built it. Took just as much time to mske my own as it would to mount this one. I wouldn't waste your time on this since you can build litteraly the same thing only better quality for next to nothing."
5,Read it all in one night!,I was unable to put this book down until I finished reading it. Mr. Weigel does an excellent job of describing the relationship between the faith of Europe and current political affairs. He goes into a great amount of detail and really breaks it down so that anyone could understand it. I would truthfully recommend this book to anyone.
3,Okay Read,Very interesting subject and hoped he would speak more on the current situation rather then spending the majority of time proving his position from an historical perspective. Seem to rely heavily on a few particular authors and felt at times I should just read their books rather than this one.
5,The decline of Christian Europe,"According to Weigel Europe is in demographic decline in part because it is in religious denial, refuses to recognize its own past. It is in decline because it fails to link its future with its past, but is willing to live in and for the pleasure of the moment.Weigel is distressed by Europe's empty churches. He too notes the rise of a rapidly growing Islam in Europe. He feels a tired, aging people lost in its own pleasures is not eager for children.This is an excellent Catholic view of a subject now being explored by many others."
3,A good essay turned into a book,"Much as I would love to write a thoughtful, erudite review of this book, because I think anyone who actually read it is probably both of those things, I'm going to do something Mr. Weigel didn't do, and that is, be concise.The premise of the book is correct, the warnings he gives are ominous, if not somewhat overstated. But he belabors his point. He also keeps quoting from the same three or four sources, like a junior high report.While this is a weighty subject, the book itself is an easy read. Still, I felt like he crammed twenty pages of material into a 300-page manuscript. There was so much repetition and trimmable material, I found myself getting bored and skipping pages. This would have been far better as a lead article in FIRST THINGS.I'm a big fan of Weigel's. He is a much needed thinker and writer today, but this is not one of his best efforts"
3,Review,"Quite readable and interesting. Took the Cube in Paris and the Cathedral of Notre Dame - also in Paris - as symbols of man without God and man with God. Attempted to show - reasonably successfully in my opinion - the deficiencies of a political system that tries to operate as if God did not exist. The author, George Weigel - always worth reading - is writing from a Christian point of view, which I share. A good read, especially for those who, while believing in the separation of Church and State, would like to see Christian insights having more influence in the public square."
4,Titanium Soundwave,"Titanium Series Soundwave is clearly intended as an adult collectable. He's heavy and a little cumbersome, and not easy to play with. He is not child friendly, as joints loosen quickly over time and would likely break under repeated transformations. This particular Soundwave is meant to be displayed, and does so beautifully. His accessories (stand, weapon and Laserbeak) add just the right touches to make him into a lovely display piece and his six inch size makes him a great centerpiece for a collection. Overall, I believe this figure is a solid addition to Hasbro's adult collectables and specifically to the Titanium line."
5,Unipod,Love this thing. I take it to football games and no longer have shaky video and a tired arm. One of the best features is the quick attachment.
5,Velbon UP 4DXII Unipod very handy,Happy with this product and found no issues with it so far. i would definately reccommend this product to other photographers
5,Simply Amazing,This CD (album at the time) was an instant hit when it came out in London all those years ago and listening to it even today brings back all sorts of memories and an appreciation for good music. You can almost picture Bob Baldwin striking all those keys on the piano and wonder to yourself how music can have such an effect.I have bought all of Bob's CDs ever since but this one remains one of the best ever. I hope you enjoy it too.
1,HOLY HORRORS!,"Somewhere along the line, DEMON HUNTER might have seemed a good idea: a halfbreed demon (he's half human too) is called on by the Catholic Church when exorcisms fail. This halfbreed, Jacob, has his own way of dealing with the possessed, using martial arts to the nth degree and usually killing the possessed. Stephen J. Cannell, the producer who brought us THE A-TEAM, and has written several good Shane Scully novels, is responsible for this gloriously ill written and acted bomb. And why Sean Patrick Flanery, a decent actor, agreed to star is baffling. While he manages an aloof Clint Eastwood-style delivery, his dialogue is so horrible and his script so erratic, he gets lost in the mire as well. Even at 78 minutes, DEMON HUNTER seems too long!"
1,"Wow, this is bad","Demon Hunter is as lowest of the low as you can get in terms of low budget horror that fits right at home as a Sci-Fi Channel original movie. Sean Patrick Flanery stars as a human/demon hybrid who hunts his own, and has his sights set on a very evil demon (genre stalwart Billy Drago) in this shlock fest. Now, I don't have anything at all against low budget horror/thriller/sci-fi films, nothing at all. However, Demon Hunter is so bad in terms of story and some atrociously laughable dialogue that you'll be busing a gut when you hear it. Flanery is servicable and appears to take the material seriously enough, but one wonders how he got stuck with this bomb. At a very, very brisk 78 minutes running time, Demon Hunter is over before you know it even begun, but mercifully that's a good thing with this film. All in all, Demon Hunter may be good for an unintentional laugh, and that's it."
1,Not very useful...,"The concept is good but the feasibility of being able to use the card is useless since it doesn't take into account the card combinations with multiple opponents in different positions. I found the the POKER WHIZ WHEEL is a much more powerful tool to use at any level, against multiple opponents in different positions."
2,Good Idea but only received one of two cards,"This is a great idea to discipline yourself in the beginning stages of hold-em poker. The card that I did receive was very helpful when it came to some of the ""middle of the road"" hands that may seem good but in reality are not likely to pay off. As you play you can broaden your strategy and play some of the lower ranked hands but for playing by the book this is a good reference.I rated the item a 2 because I only received 1 of the 2 cards that were promoted at Amazon. Amazon did send another shipment but it only had 1 card as well so I assume there was a problem with the ""shipping and handling""."
2,Was not a big hit!,my husband loves poker so I thought based on reviews he might like these...well he never looks at them and I believe they are lost now and were sorta a dud.
4,I LIke my New RIng,It's a nice ring I think. I am glad I added it to my jewelry and ring collection.
4,:),"This ring is nice, it's just what it looks like in the picture. I wore it everyday for since I got it, but the silver plating starting to come off and it started to turn my finger green. I figure, if you don't wear the ring every minute of every day, it'll be fine though."
4,Perfect for what I wanted,"The ring is beautiful, it looks as great in person as in the picture. If you buy it you will need to clean it often - it begins to dim with wear very quickly. and it is thin so if you buy it be ready for easy dents. Otherwise you will really enjoy the ring and will probably be happy with it."
4,LOVE IT!!,"fast delivery, lovely packaging, accurate sizing... I haven't taken the ring off since it arrived!!"
2,"Very pretty, but band bends like crazy!","I got this ring, and it was gorgeous, fit me exactly, but within a week of wear, the band started to change, and the silver was so thin, it bent, and my ring broke... I'd find something a bit stronger if I were you."
2,"Great shipping, poor quality product","I was very excited to receive my two nickel free sterling silver claddagh rings in only one day (I have a Prime account and get two day shipping). I immediately put my ring on (yesterday). This morning I woke up and had a green ring around my finger. If the ring was truly nickel free sterling silver, which is what I paid for, it would not leave a green ring. I am very disappointed."
3,"Pretty, but definitely not strong.","I bought this ring for myself last year around Christmas time and bought a similar one for my sister as a gift. We both wore ours frequently (just about every day). At first, the band bent a little but I didn't mind. It fit my finger perfectly still and since I was wearing it on my thumb, I figured it would bend into a more oval shape.The other day, I was wearing the ring and I was washing my hands and I felt a little pain in my finger, almost like a pinching feeling. Of course I look down and the band is cracked in half and no longer wearable.I don't know what caused this ring to break since I always take it off when doing something that might damage my jewelry. I'd recommend this ring but only for casual/occasional wear."
5,Amazing,I ordered the .925 sterling silver claddagh band polish finish ring. The ring is absolutely beautiful. It looks just like the picture and is exactly the right size I needed. I received the ring a day earlier than expected and if I needed help I know Gem Avenue would have responded back immediately. I rate this place as a 5.
1,Not real - caused serious allergies,"I was so excited to get this ring because I LOVED the design and I've always wanted a claddagh ring but when I wore it, I was extremely disappointed. I only had it on for about 3 hours before it made a 2 inch wide green ring around my finger and even though I took it off, I still got a major rash later on. The ring is NOT real, which should have been mentioned in the description. My finger is now scarred up because of how serious the rash got. Don't buy this ring if you have any reaction to cheap/fake metal."
1,Looks nothing like the picture.,"They didn't send me the same ring as in the picture, similar, but much cheaper looking. They also don't run true to size at all. I'm a 6 and this must be a 7 1/2. Don't waste you money."
3,Not A Mens Ring,"It looked as though it was a mens ring and I purchased it for my husband. When I got the ring, I realized it was a ladies ring. Not at all what I expected. Disappointing. Please specify ladies or mens."
4,What a nice Claddagh Ring,"This claddagh ring has the celtic symbol instead of the hands folded hands, I prefer the hands. II gave my friend that was allergic 2 nickel this 1. She LIKED IT."
5,This is good quality ring and a very pretty ring,I bought this ring for my wife. It came when it said it would come and it is a very good looking ring.
5,A Beautiful Ring,This is a beautifully crafted and well made ring. It was just what I expected it to be and more.
5,beautiful rings,These are spectacular rings. Real shiny with a Celtic design on them. I bought two of them as Christmas gifts for my husband and myself to open together on Christmas I also bought the claddagh ring mini book as a keepsake. We already have wedding bands so I plan on him wearing my claddagh ring on his little finger and I will wear his on my index...
5,Claddagh Ring,Arrived on time. Very nice and shiny. I purchase for my index finger. It looks very elegant. I recommend it.
5,Amazing!!!,It is absolutely gorgeous and fits perfectly!! I got in two days when it wasn't supposed to come for a week!!
4,great bargin,I purchased this ring for a gift for my daughter's birthday. The ring was nicer that the picture looked online. She was really pleased with the ring.
4,great deal,this looks great. you would never know how inexpensive it is. great buy. just wish that they had half sizes. definitely recommend
5,"Best Deal, Top Quality","I bought this ring for my husband's birthday. He is going to Ireland, and has always liked this design. He likes silver, but only with a good polish, and not too heavy.This ring was perfect. It has a great polished finish, the weight was perfect, and the design was exactly what you see online, no flaws. This is a must buy and I shopped this ring online for a while and found this to be the best buy/quality."
5,High quality ring at an excellent price.,This is a gorgeous ring that manages to be feminine yet sturdy at the same time. I've worn it daily for the past month and it still looks fantastic and has kept it's shape. The sizing is perfect and the band is extremely comfortable. This is most definitely the best Claddagh ring I've ever owned.
4,Wonderful little ring.,"Like I mentioned in the feedback, this seller was in my same state and shipping was great (on time, condition, etc.) It was exactly what I was expecting and looking for."
3,Cheap and plastic looking,"It's cheap!! It looks like plastic, I actually had to check inside the band to make sure it was sterling silver. I guess you get the quality that you pay for..."
4,"ring, great! shipping, not so much...","I love this ring and I think it's beautiful, but it took a while to get here. Over all, I'm happy with the product and the ring sizing charts provided on the site are very accurate. Enjoy! :)"
1,Pretty - but not worth the money,"Pretty ring, but turned finger green after 1 day...I would not think sterling silver should turn your finger green..!"
5,Charming,"I love this ring. Is very detailed. Looks exactly as pictured. I was a little worried about sterling silber, but I haven't had a problem and I never take it off! Was exactly what i wanted!"
2,The Red Balloon,Was written in a play format. Too difficult to read to my granddaughter. Would have preferred story format. Was not noted as written. Will be sure to check this next time I order books.
5,An unusual friendship,"A lonely little boy is befriended by an impertinent red balloon, and they have adventures together. Our family loves this story of self-sacrificing friendship -- I really like that the sad ending is followed by a happy ending.This book is illustrated with movie stills from a 1950's production set in Paris. I like how the ""real"" pictures go together with the fantasy story line.My kids want to know where is the little boy's Daddy? -- Maybe he died in the war.And why aren't there any girls at Pascal's school? -- That's how it used to be.And why is there a guard in church? -- That's France for you. Lots of beautiful places to see.Great action/imagination story -- we all enjoy it. I found this book through ""What Else Should I Read? -- Volume 2"""
3,The Red Balloon,"I have been looking for the Red Balloon for a few years in bookstores. I have a copy in Japanese that was given to me as a gift in Japan. As I have shared my Japan information with many schoolchildren, I have also shared the book in Japanese. Now I have the English complement to show them the differences and similarities. I only wish I had been able to find the same illustrator, instead of the photos that make up this copy of the book. It is great to have my own copy to add to my presentation materials. Thanks"
2,no pictures,The Red Balloon was a gift for my sister. She emailed me and said she watched the movie with 2 of her children and the movie brought back so many memories. She had the book years ago but lost it.As a surprise I mailed her this book under the impression there were pictures through out. Not a picture anywhere :(I think she returned it...sorry.
5,a wonderful story and a profoundly enduring memory,"As a very young boy, I remember asking my mother to read The Red Balloon to me a hundred times or more; something must have truly spoken to me in the story of this child with the ever-faithful balloon friend. On par with Saint-Exuperie (author of ""Le Petit Prince""), the metaphors in this 'children's book' run a gamut of complex emotions -- from learning love for friends, to feeling different and expelled, a sense of loss,... but then ultimately reclaimed, finding joy in one's own self. There's sadness, but also understanding, as the balloon's 'life' goes. The lessons here are obvious ones, and I am glad they were imparted on me at an early age. I highly recommend this title to kids 3 to 8 -- particularly if they seem introverted or shy. They might not always be so, once they learn to let go! FYI, you may find copies of The Red Balloon currently (12/12/99) at your local Resoration Hardware; thanks guys! Oh, and don't forget to read to a child! :-)"
5,An Unusual Friend,"Pascal's mother does not allow him to have any pets. And since he has no brothers or sisters, this makes life very lonely. So, it is a lucky day when he discovers a beautiful, big, red balloon.He also discovers this is no ordinary balloon. Although it is sometimes naughty and seems to have a mind of its own, the red balloon becomes a loyal friend. Pascal's mother, the school principal and a local gang give Pascal and the balloon a lot of trouble, but friendship can overcome such trouble as this.And it is because of this friendship a TERRIBLE tragedy happens, but because of this awful event a WONDERFUL happening takes place. This may seem unusual...and it is. (This modern fantasy is suitable for the primary grades.)The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
5,"FUNNY,ENTERTANING,& BTTR THAN U THINK","LOOKING AT THE COVER WUD MAK U THINK THIS NOT A GOOD PLAY ON THE CONTRARY. VERY WELL WRITTEN FUUNY,THINK ABOUT THE CHOICES U MAK. YR LIFE CUD DEPEND ON IT!(HURTING PEOPLE HURT PEOPLE)."
1,Simple book for the Simple Minded,"I wish amazon would let reviewers select a negative rating such as -5 because a book like this definately deserves a below, one rating. The authors are obviously modern fundamentalist that wave and thump their Bibles then they don't even believe half of whats in them. Case in point the section titled 'authority of the believer' despite (1 Tim 3:15 & Hebrews 13:17). Then theres the overall assumtion on their part, that the Lord failed in what he said, and set out to do in (Matthew 16:18-19)."
1,Extremely Inaccurate Polemic.,"This is a work of polemic; I understand that. As lowly as I rate the author's religious stance, I give him his right to defend his (albeit extreme) opinion.What irks me about this book is its complete lack of accuracy. Equating witchcraft with devil-worship, calling transcendentalism a cult and Marxism and Existentialism ""religions"" is only the start of it. I'm fairly convinced that Mr. McDowell did not do any research at *all* for this book.If one is going to write books stating how horrible various religions are, one should at least learn the facts about those religions first."
1,The title of this book is misleading,"I bought his book thinking that it would contain a basic summary of each of the popular religions (I didn't read any of the reviews before buying it). The author obviously spent a great deal of time studying many religions, unfortunately, his very bias comments that are interspersed within the text make the book impossible to read. Please Mr McDowell just give us the facts of the religions and not your opionion. This book should of been titled ""why my religion is right and yours is wrong"".Concerning his arguments for his chosen religion, what can I say other then they make him look like a fool. His logic to identify an occult religion would surely apply to own religion, but he simply doesn't see it. Its quite sad to think about his state of mind"
1,Handbook of Today's Religions,"McDowell's purpose may be noble in writing this book, but sadly it is very one-sided and based on his own perspective and interpretation of biblical sources. This book sadly fails to inform. It prohibits dialogue between the various traditions of the world, which would have and certainly does sadden God. The book is ignorance defined, I am afraid, and I would have hoped for more from the author. However, when one person or group decides they have a monopoly on the truth, then books such as this are the result. I would say this to any person of any faith who wrote a book so dismissive of traditions besides its own, so this is not simply as dismissal of a Christian author. Mr. McDowell should be ashamed of this book. I am ashamed for him."
2,McDowell and Co. shoot themselves in the foot with this book,"I could not help but fight back a laugh at the thought that Reformed Christian Hellenists have taken it upon themselves to accuse other religions of occultism. Consideing Christianity's adoption of such pagan beliefs as Trinity, Divine Incarnation, Vicarious Atonement, Original Sin, and on and on and on, McDowell & Co. are virtually putting themselves on trial. This book serves as an excellent case study for psychology into the mind of pathological liar."
1,Not quite right,"I picked up this book, just to see what it had to say about my faith, Jainism. Upon reading the chapter, I immediately realized the authors of this book had not done their research correctly. Jainism is NOT a shoot off from Hinduism. It is it's own religion without the aid of Hinduism. The authors obviously did not do their research correctly or misunderstood Jainism. I cannot trust the rest of the content of this book based upon what I already found to be false. Just beware of what you are believing while you read this book."
3,Samuelle had one of the hottest new jack swing records,"I had been trying my hardest to figure out who sings ""So You Like What You See."" Everyone I asked had no idea what I was talking about. The chorus goes, ""So you like what you see (you like), you better put a hold on me (get with the program)."" This will always be one of my favorite songs of the new jack swing era. I don't think this album as a whole is a classic but it is decent. ""So You Like What You See,"" is a classic song though. He was the voice behind the classic ""Lean On Me,"" from the movie."
2,Has not stood the test of time,"Back in the day, I purchased the 12"" version of ""So you like what you see"". The Teddy Riley remix was slamming. Not sure why I didn't buy the Album, but whilst I have been trying to update my collection, I came across this on Amazon and thought I'd cop it. I was extremely disappointed. I got a clue to now bad this CD was by reading the lyrics to the songs. Even then I thought 'well, it could be all about the groove'. Wrong again. 16 odd years after its release, this sounds dated, and tired. I've only given it 2 because of the afore mentioned ""So you like""."
3,A Journey In Black Paradise,"Atlantic records, Samuelle's Foster/McElroy produced beats (new jack swing), and new jack vocals produced one big hit in the year 1991 with the single ""So You Like What You See"" (R&B no. 1). The Teddy Riley (sounds like something Riley's Today would come out with) track was well assembled and competently sung, but completely devoid of individuality and distinction. New Jack smokers like ""Black Paradise,"" and ""Greedy Man,"" failed to chart or make any hype. This album sought to cover all bases, and instead wound up with a little bit of everything and nothing that remotely stood out or gave any indication of what Samuelle's music was supposed to be, or was intended to reach. This would forever be known as the album that launced a career for R&B group Somethin' For The People (had one big hit in the year 98), who contributed vocals and production. Samuelle would return in 1996 with the single ""All That Matters To Me,"" on Bellmark records."
1,Looks like a good product but never recieved it!,There was some mess up with the company and we never did get the 2 we ordered. Would have been nice to have last fall for leaf clean up.
3,Audio dropouts,"This Blu-Ray has several audio dropouts in Act I and a few in Act II. I haven't yet listened to Act III. They seem to be defects in the Blu-Ray disk, rather than a defect in the film source. I was concerned that the dropouts might be an indication that my player was mistracking, but now that I have read the several reviews below complaining of the same problem, it is clear that there is a mastering or pressing problem with the disk. My three-star rating reflects a compromise between a 5-star rating for the film and a low rating because of the dropouts."
3,buyer beware,"I was delighted to see this wonderful film performance available on a blu-ray dvd. I immediately ordered one from Amazon... However watching the disc, halfway into act 1, there were several spots where the sound just dropped out... I returned the disc to Amazon who prompltly sent a replacement... However the replacement disc had exactly the same problem of sound drop outs in the same places. Apparently this is either a problem in the production run of these discs, or sloppy attention to the mastering from the original film.. I returned the replacement disc for a refund.I would love to own this dvd.. but I am not going to pay the price for one that does not play perfectly.."
4,biased evaluation,"from my limited experience i believe that elizabeth schwarzkopf is the finest soprano of the twentieth century. She is a fine actress and has incredible flexibility in her voice giving her the ability to give each phrase a unique expressivness. When one listens to her voice one knows instinctively whether she is asking a question, musing about some thought or making a declamatory statement. All of these atributes are all the more apealing because physically she a very beutiful woman. Thank you."
2,Great version but poor DVD production,"It is a real shame to realize that there is no difference in quality between the VHS version and this new one on DVD. This is originally such an unbelievable and charming performance with Karajan at his best years and with the unbeatable Schwarzkopf in her most amazing opera role. After having seen this version in a theater, it is very difficult to watch this poor quality video at the time of high-resolution DVD. In addition, the English subtitles from the VHS version have disappeared - I could not believe it. If you really want to own this version, do not spend this money on the DVD version. If you still have a VHS player, go and get the VHS version at low price."
1,a sad edition of a classic film,"I was lucky to have seen this magnificent film in the early 1970's. I and the entire audience were swept away by the beauty and elegance of this Salzburg stage production which was somehow transmuted into compelling cinema by the great Paul Czinner.Whether or not this is the greatest Rosenkavalier, Schwarzkopf, Edelmann, Karajan, et al. have the style of this music and drama in their blood. They perform it with an ease and authority that was their birthright.Sadly, it is now only available in this wretched pan and scan video which looks as if it had been tranferred from a grainy 16mm print. Kultur video needs to pass the rights to this treasure on to a company who can give us the restored DVD edition that this classic document deserves."
3,Dated and Disappointing,"Even in its Blu-ray reincarnation, this 50-year-old film seems dated. One constantly feels that he is watching an old movie and needs to make allowance for the vintage of the sets, acting, picture quality, and sound. (And I don't mean the audio drop-outs that are mentioned in other reviews.)After being dissatisfied with this recording, I purchased the recently released 1982 Metropolitan Opera performanceStrauss: Der Rosenkavalier - James Levine Metropolitan Opera Exclusive DVD, starring Kiri Te Kanawa, Tatiana Troyanos, Judith Blegen, Kurt Moll, and Luciano Pavarotti. Overall, I find Levine/Te Kanawa greatly preferable to Karajan/Schwarzkopf. Others may prefer the 1979 Kleiber video from MunichStrauss - Der Rosenkavalier / Gwyneth Jones, Brigitte Fassbaender, Lucia Popp, Manfred Jungwirth, Benno Kusche, Carlos Kleiber, Munich Opera."
5,A great movie with all the best aspects a movie could have.,Barb is a nuteral in a second civil war in the U.S.. The Congresionals believe she is part of an underground black market to help rebels get out of the coutry. With Violence in the only free city left she fights to keep herself out of the middle of it all.
2,Barb Wire is just a bad movie.,"Barb Wire is a disappointing movie. Based on the Dark Horse Comics character, the movie is pretty small on plot. The film's script was just poorly written. Writers Chuck Pfarrer & Ilene Chaiken (with story by Chaiken) could have written something much more entertaining but instead did not do so. This movie is also criticized for ripping off elements of the film ""Casablanca"". Pamela Anderson Lee was well casted in the lead role but was mainly just used for her cleavage, which was a shame. Director David Hogan just kept using Pamela only for her 'assets'. Hogan did shoot some great action scenes but really nothing more."
4,Barb Wire,"Considering the source material, and original budget for the film, this BD edition of Barb Wire came as a pleasant surprise. It will never match the pristine presentation of newer films, but it does look very, very good! AQ can be problematic at times, but satisfactory. A significant upgrade over the DVD release. Recommended."
3,"Bad acting, shaky storyline, good parody...","If it wasn't for her silicone-enhancements, Pamela ""Don't-call-me-a-babe"" Anderson probably wouldn't be in this movie... but consider where the story came from, a comic-book, and that just about explains it all. Taken as just that, the movie is okay, and features the requisite T&A, ""good cop turned bad cop turned good cop"", loss of a loved one, etc. etc. The parody elements are especially funny, especially since they consider the Canadian currency valuable, and actually staged an Air Canada airplane! Maybe American viewers may not understand parody humour but hey, dammit, Pam's a Canadian! All in all, not Oscar material, but not bad for those times when you just want something to pass your time... like a comic book."
3,Watched with the sound off sometimes.,"Yes this certainly is not a serious film, and the acting by several of the artists can only be described as wooden, but there are some funny bits and there is no neglecting Pam in a variety of rather hot appocoliptic outfits. Pam who is a dynamite package of woman flesh plays the bounty hunter club owner and seductress extraordinaire, Barb Wire.If you're in the mood for stark beauty in black leather this fits the bill. As an aside, I recall hearing that during the filming of this epic, someone was stealing Pam's wardrobe regularly after the hot outfit scenes were filmed!"
3,"pam looks great but i thought the BIGFATSO STOLE the movie,,","the story was a little confussing but i liked it pam looked great and het fight scenes were done very well, I thought BIG FATSO stole the movie he was everything a slob should be and very cunning.the love interest could have been more and more bath tub scenes could have helped"
1,P.U.,"If I were given the option of a lower rating, I would have picked it. I'm only writing this review in the hopes that Ms. Anderson-Lee reads it herself(Ha!), thus allowing me the chance to tell her to please spare us from any more of her ""raw talent"". So impressed was she by this movie, that she got a barbed wire tattoo on her arm. Let it serve as a reminder of something she should never, ever do again. Go back to Playboy or Penthouse and stick with what you know best."
1,I can't believe I got this one!!,"Garbage, total trash. There should be a rating less than 1 star for this stuff..."
5,A trash classic!,Barb Wire is the Citizen Kane of trash! This film is an instant timeless classic and will be revered and studied for generations. Clint Howard is even in it! Superb DVD presentation is 16x9 enhanced to ensure this version's viability into the millenium. Also features about 15 minutes worth of outakes featuring Pam being sprayed down with ahose. A must have.
2,Fetish Pamela,"If you have a penchant for fetish attire (you know, leather, heels and the like) and you happen to appreciate Pamela's charms then this is a MUST OWN ! Otherwise - as done by others who bought this DVD - better stick to the Playboy collections..."
3,"Basically, this is a really cheesy re-make of ""Casablanca""..","... but instead of Bogart we've got the incredibly sexy-looking Pamela Lee-Anderson in the title role. And instead of North Africa in 1940, it's a post-apocalypic America that provides the setting. Pam really is a beautiful woman (in an admittedly sleazy way), and I have to acknowledge that she's the only reason I continued watching this otherwise forgettable film."
5,re-viewing PAM,"she's Great in how vicious she is with people.while the movie's actual central character is Cora D / Victoria Rowell who wears the lenses only at movie's end, Pam's great in every way!"
3,You know who the real stars are...,...with the opening scene; Pam's twins! It was a decent plot (but who is watching this movie for a plot?) with decent action and decent acting. The twins however were at their best!!!
2,Not Quite Truly Awful,"Barb Wire has nowhere near the class or entertainment value ofsome other ""post apocalyptic"" genre films like ""TheRoad Warrior"". I found it to be mediocre at best. In fact the ONLY redeeming value of this film are the substantial physical assets (and substantial they are) contributed by Ms. Anderson Lee particularly in the opening 5 minutes. After that I might as well have gone to sleep. The film concept had potential and the ""Casablanca"" adaptation was a good idea. There were some moments when the story had a chance for some interesting twists but it never quite worked. Ultimately, the whole thing came crashing down because of dreadful acting, lame dialogue and a completely transparent story line. Outside of Pam's gratuitous flashing this movie was just plain dull. Anyone interested in seeing Pam's body should just refer to Playboy. If you want a good action, ""good vs. evil"" popcorn movie, there are many, MANY more better than ""Barb Wire""."
1,Not good.,"This video is just not good. I rented it, thinking it would be so bad it would be funny. It's just not good. I also figured it would be sexy, what with Pam Anderson starring in it. But it's not. She's not photographed very well, and ""strips"" all the way down to a full length dress in her strip scene. The story is bad and the acting stinks. Don't bother with this video."
3,Good but not great,"A million times better than the crap classic Casablanca, Barb Wire at least has all the good elements for a perfect film. A girl like Pamela Anderson for sure is a perfect choice for the babe. Plenty of action, a little bit of t&a; and again lots of actions! The first scene when she is dancing is classic stuff my friend! And don't call her babe!***1/2"
2,if you love pam,"This film is supposed to be a lot of fun, not an oscar contender, and it does this very well. The best part for me was the first 5 mins, this is why pam was put on this earth, so if you like pam in all her glory then buy this film."
5,great purchase!,This Square Perfect SP500 Platinum Photo Shop Studio was an excellent buy. Great value for what you get! Works just as we thought it would and our photo images are great!
2,You get what you pay for,"I so wanted this and was looking forward to receiving it. I was hoping it would help me greatly with my pictures for my online store. However, it didn't.First of all there are no instructions.Secondly the tents (especially the larger one) are hard to put back into the folded position.The extra backgrounds are all folded up and the creases are impossible to get out even after lots of attempts to iron them out.The store away case is actually pretty handy as I've given this set 3 tries and it hasn't left the closet since."
2,Lots of wrinkles + no manual = worthless product,"Have tried other products in this category. But this one had horrible wrinkles in the background shades. Ironing didn't fix it. There are no manuals whatsoever as to how to use it to enhance your photographs--light placement, camera positioning, getting rid of the wrinkles, etc.; just a flimsy diagram that shows how to fold back the cube.Gave it two stars because it's extremely easy to pack/unpack and move around; the concept is great, but to leave out a manual and include such a wrinkled up background shades with no solutions how to get rid of the wrinkles is just not acceptable. I cannot believe all the positive reviews. How do you all deal with the wrinkles?! The background has to be consistent and lack shadows. Wrinkles defy the purpose in my opinion."
3,Nice Product-difficult to fold up photo cube,"I was very pleased with all amount of accessories that comes with the kit. The only complaint I had was that I damaged the photo cube when first trying to fold it up using the printed instructions. The edges of the photo cube contain a number of spring steel supports that need to be twisted in a precise manner in order to fold up the cube. Using the printed instructions provided, I managed to damage this steel. It was only when I went on to youtube and found a video of this cube being folded up was I able to close the cube. It was so much easier after watching the video."
2,Lamp stopped working after one use.,"Used the set once, worked great, but next time I went to use it one of the lamps stopped working (and it wasn't just the bulb). Can't exchange just the lamp, and I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending the whole thing back and purchasing a new set (plus the box was already thrown out). I'm having one of our electrical engineers take a look at it--LOL."
4,It works - the tripod is horrible though :),"The light boxes are great, they are a little hard to fold up and put back in the cases because the frames are so ridged, I took that as a sign of quality. They hold their shape very well. The lights seem sturdy and the bulbs are nice. The tripod is not good. I wouldn't put my camera on it for anything. When you are setting it up, it feels like it is about to break! I was very disappointed in that. But the rest of it is good. The large case fits everything nicely and zips shut. I don't know how long the zipper will last, it doesn't seem overly sturdy.Throw out the tripod and everything else is just fine though."
4,Better than I thought,"Have been looking for years to purchase a photobooth for my products to put on my website to sell. The $199 price tag was too high. Read last week about this photo setup kit and Wow! What a deal.Thankfully, I read all of the reviews before purchasing and what a relief I did. The package came in about 3 days after ordering. The zipper container holds all of the equipment in secure boxes with velcro adjustable sections. Very impressive. Did as the other reviews said and ironed all of the backdrops and from camera screen and rolled them on a cardboard giftwrap tube. All wrinkles came out.All equipment works well and can't wait to start photographing for my website to sell my hand dyed scarves and other products.Tripod is very cheap but am going to give it to my grandson to get him starting in photography."
5,Excellent Quality and Photos!,I run a small wedding stationery business and was looking for something that I can use to take beautiful photos of my wedding invitations. The first ten photos I took were exactly what I was looking for and the lighting was perfect! The set up was really easy too! I couldn't recommend this product enough.
2,1 Lamp doesn't work,The 2 tents are nice and easy to use!! The fabric inserts are great!! My only problem is that one of the lamps doesn't work - right out of the box! I swapped out the bulbs and know that they both work; was able to narrow it down to one of the lamps! If the lamp had worked I'd give this setup 10 stars!!!
1,Not Worth It,"This photo studio gets a mixed review from buyers. I think satisfaction depends on one's expectations. For me, it fell well below my expectations. The overall quality of the tripods and light reflectors is low. The tripods operate very stiffly. The design isn't very good - they tip over easily. The metal sockets for the light bulbs are poorly attached to the reflector hoods. Just screwing in the bulbs is a challenge. I certainly wouldn't recommend this equipment to anyone I know."
2,Hmmmmmmm,I was disappointed that one of the bulbs blew as soon as I turned the light on. So not cool.
1,how can i resell this and make my money back ?,"as a photographer who prefers natural light, i should have known better. i used it once, and am not sure what i was doing incorrectly but wasn't happy with ANY of the shots I took, couldn't figure out how to get rid of the wrinkled fabric background, etc.not to mention, the light stands were so top heavy (because of the bulbs and bulb housing) that once they were set in their most upright position they both fell over, crashed against and the table and broke both bulbs.looking to resell this to someone else, but i'll have to take a hit on it."
4,solid kit; works as advertised....has some minor issues!,"Just received the SP500 studio in the box and i am pleased with the kit.The light stands are solid and the camera tripod is fantastic.Not so sure about the sockets though...they seem fragile, i was afraid of turning too tightly...thought i might break something (that was my perception anyways). The photo tents are sturdy, it comes with two, the 12x12x12 is great for small items and a 30x30x30.One thing though, forget about folding the larger tent back into its cloth case...you'll have fits trying to figure out how to fold back....all i could do was close it so that it will at least be flat. It comes with a instruction sheet with illustrations BUT no words so forget about it....just find a closet or something.Also the bulbs seem on the flimsy side. One of them flickered and then nothing.....If you can get passed the so-so bulbs and POSSIBLY the sockets then then go for it!"
5,Perfect for Ebay Pictures,I bought this two years ago for Ebay sales and it has been perfect for taking pictures with either a black or white backbground. I am very happy with the purchase.
4,One of the better picks (9/27/72),"I wouldn't say this is the best Dick's Pick (or even the best show from September of 1972) but it's definitely one of the main picks worth owning. Why? The Dark Star mainly. This is one of the best Dark Star's in the entire Dick's Picks series.The Playing In The Band, while nice enough, isn't really a mind-blower. The one on Dick's Pick 23 (from 9/17/72) blows this one away... utterly destroys it.The China Cat > Rider is a pretty hot one and Phil's bass sounds thick (as it should) throughout this release.Whether or not you'll like this pick all just depends on what you want from your Grateful Dead. All the little filler tunes are played well enough here so I doubt those will bother anyone. What really matters though is that at least one of the heavy jam tunes (Dark Star) is played for all it's worth. Sure it would have been nice if the Playing In The Band were also a monster but the Dark Star is enough to earn the 4 stars all by itself."
2,off nites,"I'm somewhat baffled by the high ratings this set has received because it's just not that good. Weir's playing on China Cat is plain wrong, the vocals overall tend to be ragged, and Garcia is too low in the mix. Yes, there are moments (""Dark Star"" among them), but I've never understood how this one got released. For all its slickness, ""Europe '72,"" especially the recent reissue, blows this away, as do other Dick's Picks (like #1 & #16, just to name two). There are some real clunkers in this series and this is one of them."
2,This was the weakest night of the run,"I can't for the life of me understand why Dick chose this night over the practically impeccable Thursday 9-28 show, or the Tuesday 9-26. Both were FAR better.This show has several highlights. Uncle John's Band is fine. The Attics was a REAL treat. Beyond that..? The Dark Star goes NOWHERE. Compared to the fantastic Other One jam from Thursday... what was Dick thinking?The Tuesday night had several stellar highlights: A *wonderful* Baby Blue (it is a crime that the Stanley's were picked and this Baby Blue -- possibly the best they ever played -- doesn't appear); a beautiful and precise reading of Tomorrow is Forever, and a wonderful bass solo that bridged Truckin' jam into Other One, which apparently may have been lost due to a reel-changing.This was a great run of shows, but after all these years, I was very disappointed, and quite frankly confused, by Dick's choice for this middle night over the clearly superior other nights."
5,Overall excellent,"Comfortable shoe. I had to get the wide size, and received exactly what I expected. I like the style and fit. Overall Excellent."
2,Bookclub recommendation...,"If it were not for ""having"" to read it for bookclub, I never would have picked this downer book up..... and still wished that I did not!"
3,All wind-up and no pitch,"Too bad I can't give separate stars for writing and for story. The writing is excellent and rates five stars: well observed, smooth. But the plot! Where is it? The same things happen over and over. There is simply no building action, no change in any of the characters. McCormick begins insane and remains insane; Katherine begins loyal and remains loyal; and O'Kane begins as a drunk and a wife beater and ends as a drunk and a wife beater. No one grows or learns a single thing. So what if this is based on a true story? Maybe it's ""too true to be good."" I've read Boyle before. I really enjoyed only ""The Tortilla Curtain"" all the way through. He either goes on too long (World's End) or makes too much fun of his characters (East is East). I think I've read my last."
5,Mesmerizing pathos,"I read this book when it first came out in paper, and four months later it still resonates. Why? The fact-mixed-fiction-mixed-history is worthy of the tabloids today. But the hopelessness of it all is so non-Hollywood (i.e., it's not happy). Sometimes I felt like I was the one who was, uh, mentally off. Guess I like dark books with good characters and it's the viewpoints/life travails of the non-McCormick's (the main dsyfunctional family in the book) that really make the book work. This is the kind of book that SHOULD be on the bestsellers list, but, alas, we live in America."
3,Too detailed; goes nowhere,"T.C. Boyle can paint a picture with words that puts you right there in the scene, which is a quality that gives life and color to the reading experience. These scene descriptions do, however, drone on beyond tedium. You find yourself saying over and over, ""o.k., get on with it."" And therein lies my biggest complaint about the book -- it never does get on with it."
3,A little worn,"This was a present, and it said it was in very good condition. My husband is reading it. I was a bit disappointed. It may have gotten dogeared during shipping???"
3,He has done already better,"As fan of T.C.Boyles novels I have to admitt that this last work didn't quit catch me like the ones before. I missed the certain accuracy and the detailed description that made World's End and Tortilla Curtain so special to me. Some situations in this last novel are simply very unlikely and strike the reader unprepared. The background to psychoanalysis was in my opinion also lacking more effort. Still it remains a very interresting book, with an admireable stile of writing and virtuos use of words."
2,Big Disappointment,"TC Boyle is my favorite author and Riven Rock was the only book of his I had not read (including his short story collections). I was very dissapointed in this work of his. There are no characters to which I was drawn, and it was one of the least compelling plots (was there one?) I have ever read. Great author -- terrible book.Tortilla Curtain or Water Music would be much better choices."
5,lots of good info,"Easy to read. Interesting. A variety of experts give thoughtful information. The video doesn't match the book, but it does add anther dimension to a pre-Easter Bible study."
2,Disappointing,"This is the third in the second series written by Kate Kingsbury. It is not written as well as the first two, nor as well as the first series that she wrote. The answer to the murder is obvious, the secondary mystery's answer is obvious as well. There is little, if any, progress in the relationship between Lady Elizabeth and Major Monroe which is another disappointment. And, finally, the printing of the book itself, is frustrating. There are typos throughout the book which I always find annoying. I hope the next book in the series is better than this one."
4,For Whom Death Toils by Kate Kingsbury,I love the books that Kate Kingsbury has written. They are stories of the country side in the UK. I am sorry that there aren not more written for the Kindel
1,Not as expected!,"I have been practicing and studying kabbalah and I thought this workout was something special. I am very dissappointed. This is a very short yoga session that I would have done better. Also, I have read books with better meditations that the ones included here. I do not recomend this video at all!"
3,Los Masis?? Where??,"This CD, that you can reach with the ""los Masis"" research has nothing to share with the Los Masis of Sucre, Bolivia but the fact that it is Andean Music.If You are searching a CD of Andean music it's good. If you are searching something from Los Masis, search something else."
4,A FOUR-SEASON BEAUTY,"lISTEN TO THIS ALBUM BY JANE AND YOU'LL LOVE IT, BELIEVE ME. DON'T FORGET THAT SIGN#9 IS NOT AS LUSH-SOUNDING AS JANE'S EARLIER STUFF, NOTABLY ""HERE WE ARE"". THIS IS ANOTHER REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE BAND'S CAREER IN ITS OWN UNIQUE WAY: LOTS OF ACCOUSTIC GUITARS, MELANCHOLIC VOCALS/LYRICS, SWEET&GROOVY DRUMS AND ENOUGH DOZES OF KEYBOARDS TO LET YOU LEVITATE. ENJOY ;-) an extra note for Jane fans: If you guys want to listen to something modern that sounds like classic Jane! listen to Opeth's ""Damnation"" it's freakin' good."
4,Photo misrepresents actual product,"I have these dishes and wanted to complete my set. The photo appears to be the dinner plate, salad plate and mug, in reality when I received the merchandise, it was the tea cup, saucer and dinner plate. I think it is still a very good value, however, I was disappointed that it was not really the salad plate & mug."
3,Better than the first volume.,This is set finally concludes the long drawn out fight of the first volume. I really think they wasted too many episodes fighting the same three girls that earlier were so incompetent they could barely handle a starving powerless Eve but somehow can take up several episodes to finally beat. After that little segment the show gets better but by that time the damage was done for me. If you like the first volume you'll probably like this. The reason I have this is because I collect Anime Blu-Rays and I almost have them all... until more are released of course. In the end I'm glad I got this because it did get better and an average score from me means I like it but it's nothing special.
4,Winch plate,I ordered this winch plate because it looks different from all the other winch plates. It is well built and i believe it will stand up to any abuse you dish out.
4,The Rise & Fall of Modern Wicca,"I believe that this book will have historical significance. Included in this book are many accounts from elders of the Craft community that portray the decline of the Craft into the watered-down sacrine-sweet mess it's become today. It will be nice to have this book available to reflect back upon and to hear the words of those who practiced the Craft during an era in which it was credible and sacred.As one of the elders states that the Craft used to be about honoring the sacred and maintaining the ways of reverence. Today in Wicca everything is considered sacred, which accordingly makes everything mundane, which then negates the sacredness of any one thing. Modern Wiccans have forgotten, and most have never known, what Wicca is really about. This is evident by reading the vast majority of books on Wicca today."
4,Provides indepth analysis of the issues involved...,"This is an excellent book that dwells in to the effects of globalization, related issues and potential solutions. It discusses social issues and policies within the context of globalization. It also dwells in to the issues related to labor standards and income distribution. Rodrik presents good solutions but they are debatable and not easy to implement.I feel that Rodrik discusses solely from the perspectives of industrialized nations' interests. I would have liked him to explore more from the perspectives of under developed/developing nations'."
3,Disappointing,"I have to admit that I only read the first 20 pages before giving up.This book appears to be a think-tank product richly supported by business to answer a question which they are too prejudiced to answer honestly.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."
4,Solid collection that I listen to often....,"I have all 19 Dick's Picks. Most of them have a few songs I consider the ""best version available"", and some I usually skip. DP 7 has neither! It's just a real good show, with fun song selection, sharp playing and no rough patches. Some of the high lights include a great Scarlett Begonias, and a Not Fade Away that really moves. There are several good versions of ""first set"" tunes, like Mexicalli Blues, Half Step Miss. Uptown and Brown Eyed Women. Big River and Wharf Rat are also here. The band was tight, their voices were clear, and even with Dark Star, the mood was not very spacey. When I want some solid, easy listening Dead in the background, either in my office, in the car or at home, I often reach for DP 7, and I'm always happy I did."
3,"Music OK, sound quality barely passable...","These shows were played after the band had had some time off. They were A)Rusty and B)Completely strung out/burned out. Very ragged playing, especially when compared to Summer '74. This set's redeeming grace is the Dark Star->Morning Dew which is very powerful. Recording quality is among the worst of the Dick's Picks series. Lots of hiss, not alot of high/low frequencies which is too bad, because that DS->Dew really shines... Steve Urbauer Stephen Urbauer"
3,Complete Weather Report Suite Is Excellent!!!,"Not a spectacular but a solid performance. For the fan who want the complete Weather Report Suite rather than just the ""Let It Grow"" portion of the song, this album offers a very strong and sungularly beautiful performance featuring Bobby playing electric rhythym guitar in an almost acoutic mode. Very interesting and very good (save the off key Donna-jeez what was Donna doing in this band ever). The rest of the album is very good but not as full throated as the bands later year performances or as full of energy and experimentation as the early years."
2,"to small for a big wrist or big hands apt 71/2"" max out need to be at least 9""","it too small max length is about 7 1/2"" long needs to be 9"" just a waisted expence for nothing extra"
4,Ecellent quality but a bit pricey,My bands last about 2 years before the band starts to deteriate. For the money you would hope it would last a little longer but it does get wet just about everyday so I'm sure it is better than most competing bands so I give it 3 stars.
1,Misleading Title and Cover Photo,"Looking for scenes from the Kung Fu television show starring David Carradine and Kwai Chang Cain? Based on the title and cover photo for this DVD, you'd probably buy this item. You would, however, be greatly disappointed upon viewing it. What you get is an episode of a late 70s Saturday morning kid's talk show (at least, that's what it looks like [and I do recognize one of the hosts from something, so maybe for nostalgia it's worth something]). Sure, the focus of the episode is martial arts, and they tease you with an ""exclusive"" interview with Carradine, and close-ups of his bare feet (woo-hoo!!), but it's really the most basic primer to martial arts, a few clips from old chinese karate movies, a visit to a dojo and about 2 minutes with Carradine. Wanna know what he says?- Kung Fu really just boils down to this [holds out a clenched fist].Worth $15? Try 15 cents.You'll get more from Bruce Lee. ""Punch is punch. Kick is Kick."""
2,"it's a swindle, but if your a Carradine fan, it's still over priced","I've read the other reviews, and I agree 99%, this is a cheap rip-off meant to dupe the average consummer, but I am a David Carradine fan, so it's good to see him, although he dosen't indorse this dvd or get any kind of royalties for it. I also did like the thirty second snipet of a real Grindhouse looking trailer for Sonny Chiba's Dragon Princess. Now, moment of truth, I picked this up at a pawn shop for a buck and a half, I was okay with that, it goes on my self with KUNG FU: THE COMPLETE SERIES and LONE WOLF MCQUADE, but I see Amazon sells this thing at $12.99 and even used it'll cost almost four bucks after S&H, to be honest, if I weren't a geek and maybe a little nuts, a buck and a half would be too much, anything more, as Mr. T would say ""I pity the fool."""
5,"I like it, and so does the baby :)","We looked and looked at mattresses before just choosing one. I finally made this decision because it was not the cheapest and not the most expensive. I think that it is softer than most, but yet not too soft to let the baby sink and become a health risk. I know that my baby loves our mattress and sleeps so well when I lay him on it while I am doing laundry or something, so I would like to let all of the new moms know that maybe the softest you can go for a crib mattress, the better night sleep the little one (and you) will get!"
3,Beware of mattress size!,"Not a bad mattress for the price, but when I got it home and put it in my Delta crib, I found there were some unsafe gaps between the mattress and crib sides. I called the store, who told me I ""must have assembled the crib wrong"" and that ""all mattresses are exactly the same size"", but with only one way to assemble the crib, not sure how I could have done it wrong! Anyway, my husband & I took a trip to the local Babies R Us to check out the mattresses in person, and found that a few actually ARE sized a little different. This Sealy here isn't TRULY the dimensions it claims, but the $89.99 ""premium"" version IS. That one happened to fit perfectly in our crib, so we exchanged this Baby Soft Classic for that one.My advice to anyone buying any mattress: buy the crib & mattress together, and try out the mattress you like in the floor model of your crib to make sure it fits snug, and there's no unsafe gaps!"
5,Nice,"Very happy with this product, it was what I want and need, has a lot of application, and a good price"
3,"Complicated, but good watch.",My son loves this watch. He likes all the different things he can do on it. I find the directions very complicated.
1,Bad experience,Though I'm a very loyal customer of Casio but this watch just break my perceptions.The watch has stopped fucntioning just after two three months. Only digital display giving the correct time.Scarcity of Authorized Service centre only added pain.Casio Men's AW80D-7A Sports Chronograph Alarm 10-Year Battery Databank Watch
4,Excelente reloj!,"Es un reloj fantastico tal cual se puede observar en su descripción. Es bastante deportivo y completo para personas que por ejemplo, quieran cronometrar sus ejercicios. Tiene tres alarmas, uno uso como despertador, y las otras dos para marcar dos horarios del dia. Los marcadores del reloj brillan en la oscuridad, y tambien se puede encender la luz, pero esta luz no alumbra la pantalla (esto sabia por que antes de comprar leí las otras descripciones del producto, pero de igual manera me compré). Sinceramente, la mejor relación precio/calidad."
3,Good Watch for the price,"Good one.All the features specified are good enough to make it a good watch.Should consider this , if thinking of this price range."
2,cheap material,"Im very dissapointed at Casio with this product, although the price was great, the product really was similiar to a toy watch from Mcdonald in craftsmanship, It fail after a week of use"
5,"Great watch, great price",It is a very good price / design is for those who enjoy easy and convenient clock.
4,"Very comfortable, light weight",Very nice watch for the price. Kind of a pain to set the analog at first. But overall a very good purchase.
2,"Weak light, battery difficult to replace","I like the way this watch looks. Like that it has analog hands as well as digital time, date, and day of the week. I only use the alarm and stopwatch so I don't need the other features on the watch. Light is almost of no use in the dark and the luminous hands are not luminous so you may as well not count on being able to see the time in any dark places. Tried to replace the battery when it died out after a year or so but it was difficult to take out the old battery and difficult to replace the new one. Followed the procedure online (need to reset by inserting needle nose pliers or tweezers into correct areas on the inside of the watch) but the watch died out on me again after only a week or so. Had good success with my previous Casio watches so I'll probably buy another one but definitely not the same model."
1,10 year battery but you'll be lucky if the watch lasts 1 year!,"Casio = Poor quality and terrible customer service! I am not very hard on my watches yet this watch began to show cosmetic wear after a few short months. I also purchased a similar model at Amazon which ceased to function and Casio did not honor their warranty. Prior to the two Amazon purchases, I bought a Casio watch when on vacation. It died within a few weeks and I thought it must have been a counterfeit. Well I know the two I bought from Amazon are genuine and now I understand that, not only does Casio make a shoddy product, but also that they have terrible customer service and will not honor their own warranty. Shame on you Casio. Needless to say, I will never buy another."
5,Great for the money,"It is incredible you can get a 10-year battery watch for so low. If I ever change the battery, I don't know if I will be able outlast the watch! LOL"
5,Good Watch,"The Casio AW80-1AV does exactly what I desire in a watch. My requirements were simple, analog and digital readouts with a comfortable band. This is larger than my older Casio but still fits fine. I do not need all the extra features, but for the money, this watch is great.I have another one of these but with a white background. The black background is easier for me to see the hands. I wore the white background all the time but decided to get another to so I could wear the older one strictly for when I am working around the house since the white background one has taken a bit of a beating.I have always had good luck with Casio, one got tilled into the ground and when I found it a week later it was still working. Another, my wife’s, went through the wash in the pocket of her bathrobe and still worked."
4,"Good watch, good value.","The Casio Forester is an excellent value. It has the functionality of a $40 Ironman for half the price. My vision is worsening so the analog display is helpful. The date and time display is very handy for me. The controls are reasonable and explained well in the manual. The main functions I was looking for was a count down timer, alarms and a night light. This watch has all of those and many more. I had to practice the functions a bit at first. It is not hard to get used to the command buttons. My only disappointment was the the loudness of the alarm and timeout signals. I am hard of hearing and have missed the alarms completely once or twice. Just couldn't hear them. I think that this is my problem more than the watch's problem. With normal hearing, I suspect readers will be happy with the loudness. I should probable give it a 5 star but I am not. I really do like the watch."
5,Excelente compra.,"Excelente Compra y Gestión, lo recomiendo. Lo compré desde Venezuela y aún lo poseo activo, no lo piense tanto y compre este grandioso y económico RELOJ"
4,Plenty of functionality for such a low price,"I purchased the Casio ""Forester"" as a replacement for a Timex ""Ironman Triathlon - 30 Lap Flix."" The Timex is an awesome watch, but as I began looking for its third replacement band in five years, I discovered that I could buy a new watch for nearly the same price.In the end I spent an extra four-and-a-half dollars to get a new watch as opposed to fixing-up the old one, and got a watch with with just about all the same features - timer, chrono, mult. alarms, etc. - but with a bonus analog/digital display and 10 yr battery. A great buy, indeed!Pros: dual clock readout; many functions, 10 yr batteryCons: crystal face [does] gets ""scuffed"" very easily"
1,get what you pay for,"the watch looks pretty darn cheap... moreso than i thought it would. I cant even change the time on the hands, because there is no dial! do not get this!"
3,Basic watch,"the pictures don't lie. It doesn't look bad but when I saw it, it dissapointed me. It's not very ""shiny"" and the hands are not very noticible. A little bit hard to operate."
4,Watch another setup,"Watch looks most presentable, with all features intact and functional. Night light is weak though. Extraneous features make push buttoning setup directions annoying as always."
3,OK for the money,"Simple watch, time works fine in analog or digital.Complaints: no seconds ticker, back light not very bright, complicated to work w/out the booklet.For the price, its good."
1,#AW-80 1A AW80,Watch I got was not equiped with thermometer although the picture matched the product. Mine was some memo/phone number featured watch.
1,Not a Thermometer,"I also bought this watch & spent extra money because it is advertized as ""Thermometer"". There is no thermometer on it. Very cheaply made."
1,Casio Men's AW80-1AV Forester Ana-Digi Databank 10-Year Battery Watch,"Watch ceased to function. Looks like it has 10 year battery that lasts less than 4 months.Amazon says my ""return window"" has expired ....What else can I say?"
4,Nice looking but belt is kinda cheap quality,Watch looks nice but belt is made from cheap quality.I have another casio watch bought from amazon which is more than 25$ but its worth to have nice belt for me.
3,break my back - why don't you!,"This was not the best belly dancing performance I have every seen. She was too green during the whole demostration. The only part of the cd was the graphic pictures as to what part the belly dancing moves does to certain parts of the body. She bent over to much for me. If I did what she was doing I would have broke my back. It was okay, but I would not recommend this cd to anyone."
1,Don't recommend,"Hard to follow, also very annoying. The dancer is not one I would recommend for many reasons."
1,Disappointing,"I don't like how the video goes straight into the moves, with absolutely no instructions or step-by-step poses. It seems very fast paced, especially if you don't know what you are doing.If I had the choice, I wouldn't buy it again."
2,This is not for beginners,The actual workout seems fine however if you have never done bellydancing before this DVD is not for you. The instructor moves too quickly to the next step before you have a chance to grasp the move. I threw out my back trying to keep up with this one!
3,Unique and challenging.,"I'm a somewhat experienced belly dancer, and I was looking for something a little different and faster paced, and this video definitely fits the bill.If you have never belly danced before then this DVD is not for you, but if you want something challenging that varies from the average belly dance workout video, then I recommend this video."
3,Hard to follow,For being for beginners this DVD is hard. She moves right along and it's NOT for beginners.
3,Not bad but too quick,"I think Neon uses a lot of useful moves, but I don't like the fact that there are just a few repetitions. Just as you begin to get that good 'burning feeling' she moves on. She does it too quickly even for me (I've been dancing and teaching bellydance with passion for 10 years now!)Maybe she thought the viewers would be bored by repeating everything at least 10 times. I don't like the music very much, but it's ok."
1,No Instructions,"I bought this DVD with the thought that at first they might break down the moves BEFORE they just jump right into the deep end of the pool. Personally, for someone who has never done bellydancing ever before, this was a horrible buy. I didn't like the way they had the set up either, seemed dark, and they just jumped straight into the moves, telling you how to move your body as they were doing it and going onto the next one. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
4,Neon will work your ABS!!,This DVD is great! 3 routines that last 15 minutes each. Neon really works your abs. I plan to buy her other DVD's too.
1,Cheesy,"This video is very cheesy. The way it's shot is kind of annoying. Also, they just breeze through the moves without any explanation as to how they should be properly executed."
3,Is OK...could be better.,I agree that most beginners would be frustrated with this video. I have taken quite a few classes and have purchased a few DVDs and found it to be a challenge. It is not my favorite video but it isn't horrible dance move wise.Pros-It does do a number on your abs once you get the moves and techniques down properly-The guy (however weird and awkwardly he appears in the corner of the video) helps with executing the moves properlyCons-It took me awhile to catch the hang of the moves and the dance sequences-If you were not properly taught how to protect your low back while dancing you could easily hurt yourself attempting some of the moves-She moves a little fast in the sessions so it takes practice and repetitions to nail the entire routine-Seems like a very low budget videoGet this DVD if you 1) Want a bit of a challenge to work your abs 2) Don't give up easily 3) Know the proper posture for belly dancing. Seasoned dancers should not have too much difficulty.
3,Pleased,"The product was not exactly what I expected. It was supposed to be instructional, but it moved too fast. The explaination of what areas were worked was well defined, but the actual steps to do what was being viewed were complicated, and not well explained."
2,Love NEON....okay video...wouldn't purchase again.,"First, this is not a Neon bash. I love Neon. I think she has a fun, fluid, unique attitude and style that is contagious! I do not however, love this DVD. I own many, and this is not one I chose to workout to.....almost ever. It is very fast paced, and when checking for alignment or proper technique, she is already way past me and onto something else. She is such a delight, it is a shame that this video represents her. It is not her best work. Give her another chance on something else...you just might love her too, but don't chose this one for your collection."
2,Disappointing,"I'd hoped for more... The book was a bit flat and superficial, but the most disappointing aspect was the text. There seemed to be a page missing some text, because it goes from ""Here, they go into open-ended packages called sleeves... [page break] ...and then into boxes, ready for you."" to a page with only photographs of children, to the following page that reads ""...even the best-looking person you know."" WHAT? I do like the close-up photo of the crayon sorter, though."
3,"great book, but.....","Great recipes but the book is very difficult to navigate. I almost returned it,but the content is so good I kept it."
1,Terrible...Terrible Product,"Well, I bought this product because my anus was itchy. So when I got the tube in the mail, I immediately tried it out because I was in a hellish state. It gave me possibly 10 minutes of relief from my anal itching. After 10 minutes I was back to scratching. I even forgot I scratched there and I scratched my mouth. Was the worst experience in my life. I still have the aftertaste of Cortizone + My own anus. Beware of this product."
1,My child almost died in this stroller!,My baby's head got stuck in between the seat and the front canopy and we heard some weird choking noises... when we looked at him he was blue and not breathing anymore. After we rescued him it took him a few seconds to start breathing. It was very scary!!!
3,graco duorider,"When I first bought this stroller, it was much better. Slowly it became much harder to maneuver. The folding mechanism broke and one of the bars on the bottom broke - they were not mishandled! It is also hard to get stuff into the basket, plus the canopies are very flimsy."
5,"Great stroller, great price","I had this stroller for my twins right from the get go. I found it very convenient and easy to handle. It is light, much lighter than most single infant strollers. It has a big basket for when you are shopping. I found it worked for me from when my girls were infants right through to when they were three years old. I had used it on a regular basis to theme parks, on long international journeys, and just everyday grocery trips."
1,Do not buy,"Do yourself a favor and get a stroller with good wheels. This stroller is a piece of junk not worth the money, put it towards a double jogging stroller."
3,stroller,it loks so nice. but kinda regret it cuz is hard to go through stuff. specially at stores. i should have bought the long one. plus the back wheels squick. i hate that noise cuz its loud. so we tried fixing them but doesnt go away. i had to suck it up and listen to the annoying noise.
4,Great product with 2 young children,This stroller make life with 2 young children (2.5 years and 2 months) so much easier. Takes up less space in trunk than I anticipated which is great.
1,The end of an era!!,"After three incredible albums: ""Out of the cellar"", ""Invasion of your privacy"" and ""Dancing undercover"" and later the good ""Reach for the sky"" then comes the final nail in the coffin for one of my favorites in the 80's. Detonator is the synonimous of pop metal in the worst and out of ideas. In this album, i feel a tired Ratt, pushing themselves hard to make an stand out album, after the ""Reach for the sky disillusion"". For me ""Detonator"" is one of the worst album in the 80's. Try the first four albums and the ""Ratt"" ep. You won't regret it!!!"
4,Good Stuff,"This is one of Ratt's better cds. While I don't find it as good as Invasion Of Your Privacy, I'd say this is one of their best. I'd highly reccommend it to any Ratt fan."
4,Very good CD,"This Cd is very good from RATT. I believe it is one of there best albums. For other good Ratt albums, check out Invasion, Cellar, Ratt. Reach for the Sky is not there best album, but worth collecting. Also check out Shoutgun Messiah if you like this style of music."
2,The end of the line...,"First things last: Who's giving this record four and five stars? I'm a big Ratt fan, all the way back to the E.P.But this just isn't a good album. They'd resorted to outside writers by this point, because their main songwriter (Robbin Crosby) from their salad daze couldn't write killer songs anymore. I always liked ""One Step Away"", but even that's a little too clean & polished for Ratt n'Roll. Easily their worst full studio record of the five...- cRAIG"
3,I like this Ratt album,"Ratt's ""last"" album (well most fans consider it their last because it was the end of the classic line up and Robbin Crosy's time in the band) is another good album from LA's sleazerock kings. There are some complaints of ""over production"" and negativity regarding Desmond Child's involvement, but I think this is just typical Ratt N Roll, and if you like all of their albums you shouldn't leave this one out. Featuring more amazing guitar playing from DeMartini, this CD is almost as good as Invasion or Reach. Standout tracks: Shame (their concert opener for the remaining dates with Robbin), Lovin You, One Sep Away, Heads I Win Tails You Lose."
1,A different sounding Ratt,"And to those that hated when Metallica crossed over to a more alternitive style metal, I give you Ratt's ""Detonator"" I had stated on my review of ""Reach for the sky"" that Ratt was already losing their signiture sound, but at least there were some repectable songs on it. I gave it 2 1/2 stars. When Detonator was released in 1990, and I had first heard it, I knew that Ratt had truely ""sold out"" as this album is some very bad hair metal. Its sounds nothing like the Ratt of old, and even gives in to some bad ""electric"" drums. The only song on here that is any good is ""Shame, Shame, Shame"", the rest is just garbage. Even though Hair Metal would die a in two years, Ratt had died and gone to hair metal heaven after this piece of junk release. If you like your hair metal cheesy such as BulletBoys, Winger, White Lion, and Ugly Kid Joe, then this is for you. If you were a die hard fan of Ratt's ""out of the celler"" and ""Dancing Undercover"" (their two best albums) then avoid this mess."
3,Ratt - 'Detonator' (Atlantic),"Originally put out in 1990,as this was Ratt's fifth album.Not as good as,say their previous efforts like 'Out Of The Cellar' or 'Dancing Undercover',but still decent '80's metal.Tracks that sort of stand out are ""Shame,Shame,Shame"",""Lovin' You's A Dirty Job"",""Heads I Win,Tails You Lose"",the catchy ""All Or Nothing"" and ""Giving Yourself Away"".Almost sorry to have to admit,that THESE days Ratt is a band that more or less is washed-up.Ever since guitarist Robbin Crosby(R.I.P.)had exited the group after the release of this lp,it was strictly down hill from there.It was nice to have Ratt around on the arena rock touring circuit,from like 1984-89.Their current line-up is nothing to write home about."
3,"A tad more action, please","This Gabriel Allon yarn is a bit more ""cerebral"" than action-filled. Sure, there are nasty terrorists committing heinous deeds, but a lot of real estate is spent on exploring why Jews and Arabs hate each other, especially after being thrown together by the British. I actually found the book more useful in explaining the Mid-East situation today than as the fast-paced, page-ripping reading entertainment that Allon usually provides."
2,Half Full or Half Empty?,"This is the first of Silva's books featuring Gabriel Allon that I found myself skimming through to get to the good parts. Once I got to the good parts I enjoyed the book immensely, but there were far too many parts that seemed to be there merely to educate us readers about the Israel/PLO conflict, and that didn't serve any purpose in terms of moving the plot along.Were I grading the book on how well it was written, I would have given Prince of Fire all five stars. But I grade books on how entertaining they are, and I was not entertained.If I wanted a spy book in the Le Carre mold I'd want this book.But I don't like Le Carre, and found myself quite bored."
5,Love his books!,"I really enjoy Daniel Silva characters and storylines. At this point I've read enough of them that each new one is like a visit with old friends. They are exciting, thoughtful and include some interesting history."
3,Alright,"I have read a few Silva titles in the past and found them all more entertaining than this installment. The story includes no real thrills or intrigue, it seems the solution and plans are laid out from the beginning and even when the plot takes a turn it is neither thrilling or that surprising. I found the characters to be especially flat in this novel. I think Silva suffers from writing a series in that he has introduced and developed these characters so many times he just assumes the reader knows and cares about the characters as much as he does. That being said, I did enjoy reading the book and found it to be interesting, just not exciting. Silva is a good writer and fans of the series will enjoy the novel, but first time readers could choose a better starting point. A solid three stars."
2,Really disappointed,"Although the setting and factors involved appear to be intriguing they just come off as ""boring"". The characters are stale and PLEASE the endless details of the streets, roads, mountainside - NOT necessary. I'm truly disappointed because up to this point I have had nothing but the highest praise for Daniel Silva's works. But, like someone else pointed out in another review - something happens when an author writes about the same characters over and over. I believe Mr. Silva has gotten just about all he can out of Gabriel Allon, et al - and I was disappointed when I discovered that although he had thought to put an end to the character Gabriel Allon in his latest book he was advised by some friends NOT to. Too bad - I know I won't buy that one. I LOVE to read and ""consume"" a book in a relatively short time period given my busy schedule. Yet, I've been ""trudging"" through this one for weeks - not days."
5,Prince of Fire,"I love all the Daniel Silva books - his main character Gabriel Allon, even though an assasin, has captured my heart"
1,My last Silva,"Same old same old. Won""t waste any more money on Silva books. Hatred is just that. Anger can produce positive reforms but Silva rewrites the same books/s with the same persecuted attitude and strings them out needlessly."
4,Silva Consistently Delivers,"My first Daniel Silva book was The Defector. I liked it so much that I read its predecessor, Moscow Rules. I liked that so much that I decided I would read everything else Silva had written featuring Gabrielle Allon. So I've been making my way through them.Prince of Fire in many ways is typical for the series, which is to say it is a thoroughly enjoyable spy thriller with complex, relatable characters and many twists and turns.What sets it apart is the amount of history you learn about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict during the ride. Silva's background as a Middle East correspondent really shows here.Writers like Silva show that you can learn a lot of facts from fiction."
4,Silva's the man,"This guy writes consistently good, tight, well thought out thrillers. All of his books are page turners. If you haven't read any of his stuff I recommend you start with his earlier books. They all stand alone but each one is very good. Prince is another great read. No slow spots, no meandering along the way. Rainy weekend - this is your guy."
3,Prince of Fire,"I felt this book was written to satisfy the publishers requirements. It didn't have the exciting pace of his other books and lacked a compelling story to keep me excited about reading on. If I were interested in the history of Isreal and Palestine and had traveled the region,then I would have found the story much to my liking. It felt like I was in a History of Isreal class and the main story was secondary."
4,Another Engrossing Silva Read,"Silva can always be counted on to deliver a taut, fast-moving yet nuanced thriller and this is no exception. Hero Gabriel Allon sets out, somewhat reluctantly, to to avenge a massive, ugly bombing in Rome and in so doing, is forced to consider why he does what he does. In this book, as in his other Allon books, Silva ties the plot into the historic troubles between Israel and the Palestinians and ably reflects the complexities that motivate both sides. Allon is a believeable hero, now aging. Will Silva let him fade into the sunset? Doubtful, although Silva is quite capable of penning compelling novels that don't rely on this worthy hero. All in all, a good thriller. Your time won't be wasted on this one."
5,Daniel Silva gets better and better,"This is an excellent book. I have read most of Mr. Silva's earlier volumes and this is one is better than the last. His interesting intertwining of history and fiction is unique. It adds to the drama if one is familar with the Middle East and the ongoing saga of our times.The characters are vivid and believable. The story line is fluid and seductive, drawing the reader deeper and deeper into the plot.From beginning to end it was a fine read. Highly recommended."
3,Not very exciting or thrill-packed,"This is the first of Silva's books that I've read and it will probably be the last. Sorry to dissent from the strong support that Silva receives, but I didn't find this novel especially innovative, especially well written, or especially thrill-packed. A great deal of the plot was predictable, and in 400 pages, Silva throws the readers very few surprises and very few truly unexpected plot twists.The characters spend a great deal of their time, in fact, recounting the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in ways that, all told, form an interesting introduction to the complex situation for a reader who's not familiar with it. But these discussions, with one major exception, slow down the plot rather than advance it.Although Silva is clearly sympathetic to the Zionist cause (as am I), he does not deny that the Palestinians have legitimate claims, and he expresses them empathetically in the words of his Arab characters. For that I give him credit."
5,Another masterful Gabriel Allon spy thriller!,"Prince of Fire contains all of the ingredients that Daniel Silva fans expect: Suspense, complex plots, fascinating characters, human situations that resonate deeply, and action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. Gabriel Allon is one of spy fiction's most intriguing characters. What a ride!--Donna Del Oro"
5,Gabriel Allon,Never thought that I would like a series like this one what with all the different names and attires. Fantastic
4,Pretty nice... for the money,"The Velbon 607/F is a pretty nice tripod, especially for the money. I have been using it for a few months and really like it. The panning is smooth and the quick release platform is really nice.Pros:- smooth panning- quick setup- comes with a carrying bag- lightweightCons:- Since its lightweight you have to hold on to it when your panning sometimes because it jerks a little bitOverall, its a great buy."
2,"Poor quality, overpriced.","I bought this tripod with the intention of using it for both still photography and video. Its head is truly fluid moving, unlike many other tripods on the market. However, the pluses end there. The construction is rather flimsy, and is not best suited for outdoor conditions. Do not use this tripod for still photographs; one cannot rotate the head vertically, extremely limiting is usefulness. As a matter of fact, after about a month of ownership, one of the rubber pegs on the leg fell off, and now it does not attach on securely. Not only that though, is that the grip that allows you to move the head fell off, rendering the tripod useless.For $85 there are many more higher quality tripods that I would have bought. This tripod in reality is worth about $35. I will return this product, expect a refund, and go visit a real camera store to actually try out the tripod before purchasing online."
2,"nice fluid head, junky legs","the fluid head on this tripod works great, but the cheap plastic parts making up the locking mechanism on the legs broke the second time i used it. junk."
3,"grade it..... c+, you get what you pay for.","I am an amatuer. Tri-pod is fairly stable and fairly fluid moving. OK for average home-user. There is a fair amount of play in the head (especially at high zoom), before the ""fluidity"" takes effect. At high zoom, the followed, framed subject drifts off (back to it's ""zero""), when you take your hand off of cam. Maybe I have a poor one!!??"
2,"Great, except for one stupid cheap part.","It's not the cheapest, but it's the cheapest good one. Unfortunately it shows as some of the components do not feel solid or feel a bit loose, even when tightened up. For the price I can't complain, this tripod has very smooth movement and is very stable. It's not super light but not difficult to lug around. The quick attachment for the camera is not always quick as it can be difficult to get it set in just right, but after a few uses it gets a bit easier. I'd definitely buy one of these again.update: Their is a plastic piece that holds the legs in and seems to be poorly built and breaks easily. Unfortunately I was directed to return to the maker, which is very difficult to get ahold of being in England. They want me to ship the entire unit there and wait for them to fix it, which hardly seems worth the cost and effort."
1,Piece of JUNK,"At first I thought this was a great tripod and used it one time outdoors and then mostlyfor indoor still of product shots. Then I barely used it and now it is almost a year old-I went to use it (barely opened the clasp) and the cheap plastic parts making up the lockingmechanism on the legs broke. I tried to get in touch via email to the Velbon company and they donot seem to care. I tried calling and realized they in the UK. So, if you bought this piece of junkbetter return it quick before it breaks on you too and you are left with no product support on it at all.My suggestion. Buy USA made."
4,Tripod for camcorder,"I have two identical camcorders, and needed tripods for both. This is my second Velbon VideoMate 607 tripod. The first one worked so well that I decided to buy a second one of the same make and model. The fluid head works very smoothly. My pans look very professional. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it is not as steady when the column is elevated. Other than that it is a very good value."
4,Better than you'd think.,"For the price, this is a great tripod. I've used my previous velbon 587-C for 5 years straight, and found it light, easy to travel with, with a perfectly fluid head. Whoever wrote that it's jerky may not realize that there are individual tension settings for every component, so you can set the tension to be light & quick or rock-steady. I shoot with a canon GL1, mainly live events and bands, and I've found this to be a perfectly suited solution at an excellent price."
3,Broke at 6 months. Service Email Box Full.,"Tripod worked well and seemed sturdy. However, after six months (about 5 uses), an internal plastic part broke on a leg clamp. Now it is non-functional.Off to the company website: After two layers of company's deep (Velbon, and HakubaUSA), I find a service page. Email using the provided link. Bounces: 'Mailbox Full'. Try to call: ""We're sorry, we are unable to take your call."". Hmmmm. This one may be heading to the dumpster after just five uses."
4,Great for the Price,"My second tripod, I purchased this after buying my Canon Vixia HV-30 and realizing that It didnt have a LANC port, so I didnt need an expensive tripod with handle controls. The head on this is amazing, allowing for incredible pans. The head is extremely fluid with easy control levers. Its heavy enough to be sturdy, yet light enough to cary around no problem. It also comes with its own carrying case which is really convenient. The reasons I give it four stars: The head plate comes off easy, but when putting it back on the lever has come back and jammed into my fingers numerous times. One of the other main reasons I purchased this tripod was that I do a lot of night time photography, and this tripod allows for vertical shots. Having my heavier camera on there tilted all the way forward to do a vertical shot felt very unstable.Other than that, all around great tripod."
2,An average tripod,"I bought and returned this tripod. It's mostly plastic, and seemed flimsy. The head movement was jerky, even with a lightweight DV camera."
5,Great Value and Well Designed,"Received the tripod and was very pleased. First of all, it has a very smooth flow in all directions with multiple adjustments and lock-ins. That was the main reason I wanted a new tripod. Secondly, I liked the long handle which made control much easier. An unexpected surprise was how well the camera mounting bracket works - it's very sturdy and has an automatic lock in when the camera sits down in it, so it securely holds the camera regardless of position. You won't find a better tripod for the price. It's a great value and well designed."
3,Too Big,"I love this mattress, it looks super comfy. My only problem is I can barely get a sheet on it. Those stiff corner edges are my nemesis."
4,Pretty pleased,"This is a very nice mattress and seems very firm, which is good for baby. However, the vinyl covering is in a blue and white check, which can be seen through the sheets. This feature is not readily visable in the product photograph unless you select the other pictures feature. Also, there is a small tear in the binding along the edge of the mattress. Our first mattress was white, and therefore there is not a pattern to be seen through the sheets. A good solution will be to use a mattress pad."
4,Book purchase,"Im pleased with the purchase my grand kids love that book,we've read it to them over and over since recieving it"
4,"Works Fine, Does What it Says","Finding a clock radio with battery back up and radio presets was a challenge. Most of them have analog radios, which means when I flip from the baseball game (am radio) to jazz (fm radio) I have to once again slowly turn the dial until I find the spot with the best reception. It is a joy to use presets.Mine worked fine out of the box. Radio quality (sound) was good, suitable for a bedroom. Surprise, surprise, it came with the batteries (2 AAA) already installed for the battery back up.Fine clock radio."
4,Works fine,"After losing the manual, I found it here http://www.timexaudio.com/help.asp where they have manuals for all their models.The ""Dual Alarm"" allows a time for radio and a separate time for the buzzer.Each suports: Every Day, M-F or Sat-Sun and the RADIO alarm lets you set the station to play when it comes on, which can be different than the station played for 90/60/30/15/ minutes with a different volume setting.Turning the alarms on and off is easy (just press the Radio or Buzzer buttom - each time it turns on or off the alarm). Push and hold the radio or buzzer button to set the alarm time for the alarm in question (radio or buzzer).Get a copy of the PDF file with instructions and save it on your hard disk for future reference when you lose the printed one like I did."
3,"Seems nice, but not quite what I was after","I wanted something with large numbers, dual alarms, and battery backup; saw this and it seemed to fit the bill. However, once you read the manual, it says that there ARE two alarms, but one is buzzer only and the other is radio only.Back it goes."
2,CD player makes the whole thing worth pitching,"Cd player is terrible: doesn't play some Cds at all, and many of those it does play are terribly staticky and poor sounding on this unit only (not on my car system or others in the house). I actually returned the first one of these I purchased for these very reasons, but I hung on to the replacement because I was unable to find anything else I liked the looks and features of better. Wish I hadn't! Don't like the way the Cd player opens, either. I like the size of the digital clock display, the battery back-up and waking to nature sounds, but the CD function was a very important feature to me, and in that regard, this rates very poorly."
1,Don't Buy,"Had to throw this radio away after having it for only 4 days. In that time, the radio unexpectedly changed its time, date, and alarm time twice, without me doing anything with it. Unreliable if you depend on it to wake you up."
2,Okay?,"Does not explain what the designs are, if you don't have another book to explain them you will be lost. Drawings do not reflect true designs."
4,Good Designs,Got this book and CD combo and am looking forward to using them. I open up the packaging and looked through the book. Placed CD in computer and looked at images. These items will work out great for my design of mat art.
2,Disappointing,"Unlike most Dover books, this one was a clunker. The art was all roughly drawn and of little or no use to me. Had I known, I wouldn't have made this purchase. Save your money on this Dover book."
2,Eh,"I decided to read this book because Outliers was not yet in at my library. With its low rating on Amazon, I should have known it wouldn't be worth my while. There are some neat stories in there and interesting ideas. My main problem is that the book claims to change the way we will think yet gives no instructions to do so. It just gives a few examples on when intuition worked out really well and when it lead to unfortunate consequences. Probably won't read Outliers now."
5,Useful & Well Written,"I really enjoyed the book, both from a business (I own a Web site development business) and a personal perspective. The book gives the reader some keen insights as to the important nuances and peculiarities of our minds that are evident all the time. I was very impressed with how extensive the research was and how well orchestrated the content was. Gladwell's obvious writing talent allows him to smoothly weave an argument/narrative together the same way Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld used to write episodes of Seinfeld.I think that those who have been critical of this book have mistaken Gladwell's intention. He hasn't set out to establish definitive scientific theory. Instead, he's tried to give us several important glimpses of how our minds function and left the application to us. In this respect, I feel, the book is extremely worthwhile."
1,Too many annecdotes,"I was recommended to buy this book at a user experience session at a web conference.After reading it all the way through, I felt that the core of the information would have made a good 3000-5000 word piece in a journal, with a few much shorter examples.In fact as I was reading it, I found myself thinking the annecdotes were too long and can we get back to some real content please.The annecdotes do illustrate the point well though, especially some of the ealier ones like the study on married couples. This was interesting, but I felt the book did drag on after that without adding much more."
5,Experience has great value!,"This book should be recommended reading for everybody. Gladwell clearly proves that experience has great value. Kesting Ventures Corp has discovered that the brain structures that Gladwell refers to in Blink can be greatly imporved. When these improved structures are presented to experienced people during an experiential modeling session, new blocks of knowledge can be created.William R Kesting"
4,Thought Provoking,I liked the Tipping point and so picked this one up. It is maybe not as break-through but it is still an interesting exercise and i recommend it.
1,Yet another attack on rationality,"I heard that the main idea of this book is that first impressions are more valid than thoughtful reasoning, so instead of reading and thinking about the book I just flipped through the pages for a general impression. It is nonsense."
1,hmmm...,"This book literally teaches you to judge a book by it's cover. I totally disagree. There were many times in my life that I had a bad ""blink"" thought about some one or something but ignored it and realized that it was a smart move! So don't believe everything you read..."
3,"Good reading, but left me a bit confused...","I enjoyed reading this book, but it left me a bit confused. What was the author trying to say? It seems as if he was trying to say that ""Thin-Slicing"" and snap judgments can be more accurate than in detailed analysis.But then through the book, he provides data, studies, and stories to both support this idea and debunk it. So at the end of the book, you are left with the feeling that the author more or less just went out and gathered data and interview people without clarifying the issue or taking a clear stance.Its more like he just took the work of others and compiled it into a book form, without forming a solid opinion..."
2,Interesting,"The information in the book was quite interesting, but I expected the concept to be expanded to include ways in which we could use this concept in our own experience. A bit of a dissapointment and way too long to get the point across."
1,Blink and maybe you'll miss this one,"The basic idea is interesting and held my attention for a while, but eventually lost my interest."
5,Great Book,"Really liked this book...it opened my eyes as to how we as a society can make assumptions about things very quickly and not really know why. This explains the WHY. Malcolm Gladwell is an excellent writer and I also read his book ""The Tipping Point"" which is equally an excellent read. Great discussion book for a book club (nice change from chick lit!)"
2,What was the point?,"This book really grabbed my attention in the first few pages with its description of an art forgery, but things really slowed down about a third of the way into the book. The only other part that was really interesting to me was Gladwell's description of John Gottman's research with couples. That's about it. Most of the other examples were down right boring. I found myself looking at how many pages I had left. Worst of all, after finishing the book, I had no idea what the point of it was. Gladwell spends the first half of the book explaining why we should trust our gut instinct, but spends the last half demonstrating how our gut instinct can be wrong. I had to read almost 300 pages for that?"
2,trust your instincts......don't waste your money on this book,"The author is smart enough to pen down ( and cash in ) what we already know...to trust our instincts. The first and the second last chapters are definitely an interesting read. In between these two chapters all he does is to narrate examples of supposedly( i havent heard of any of these people) famous people on how they trusted their 2-second snap decisions / judgements. The author has made very little attempt to give any sort of insight on how our instincts really work. I must agree with one reader that its like going through psychology 101. The only part I truly enjoyed reading was the piece of information on autism.All said , I must admit the author did a good job in collecting data and he sure knows how to write. I have no doubt we will see more of his books in future .......lets just hope he writes something better.Buy this book when the price drops to 5 bucks."
2,Sticking to the subject,I felt that the author skipped around quite a bit in the story. Part of the book was like Marketing 101. I was disappointed.
1,Interestin storiesyet a dissapointing book,"I really wanted to like this book. I was excited when I bought it. But the book doesn't deliver.The stories are interesting in the sense you could use them as material for small talk. Yet, I finished the book with no idea of what was the point. And that's not good. The book goes on and on with examples and explanations but not once gives you an idea on how to improve your snap judgments. If you are looking for that kind of info don't buy this book. Maybe the author is planning to teach that in his next book? I'd never buy it *blink*"
5,Thin-slicing takes a mere 2 seconds,"According to the theory of this book, people make internal judgements by ""thin-slicing"" in a mere 2 seconds. Sound doubtful? In theory, it makes sense. In practice, I personally think it depends on the situation, and cannot be simplified in the ""Blink"" of an eye. Time will tell, as more research is done, using a larger sampling group.Arlene Millmanauthor of ""Boomerang - A Miracle Trilogy"" and""Forever Love and More, Encore"""
3,"Intriguing, but shallow","Gladwell's Blink offers some interesting ancedotes about rapid decision making. He offers a few cautions as well, but the tone of the book implies that rapid decisions are more trustworthy than considered reflection.While there is some discussion of marketing manipulations and stereotyping, I was hoping for more discussion of the tricks the mind plays on one -- heuristics that lead to reasoning errors, confirmation bias, and the large numbers of eyewitness ID errors among the DNA exoneration cases.While the book is thought provoking, it may be better read in combination with material on the perils of reflexive decision making."
5,finally ~,"Hey Malcolm, way to go! great book! couldn't put it down.. and it's not too often i say that about a non fiction book!.. you've got some interesting phrases - ways of putting together words unique to you that put smiles on my face... okay this is one i can recommend to all those stodgy left brainer-do it by the book people i work with, though i have no idea if they will ""get it"" after reading it or no..... I'm one of those intuitive people that 'gets stuff' but cannot explain why i 'just know' to others.. such a delight to read your book.. thank you!! :)"
2,No conclusion,"Like someone allready said, it's a bunch of stories with no conclusion to it (and yes there even is a conclusion chapter.. but guess what.. it's another story)"
2,Social Agenda,I was fascinated by the beginning of this book. Gladwell did a good job of bringing me in. I really enjoyed learning about how the brain works and processes information before we consciously recognize what we have seen. When he started his social agenda and race issues I had to force myself to finish the book. At the end of the book I felt like I was reading something from an angry citizen who felt that police officers were out to get the minority population. He should have stopped the book 100 pages sooner.
2,I don't get it. Why this book has so many stars,I got the book because of the number of reviews. I started reading it and I didn't get the first part so I continue until I got to the middle. Nothing special. Just a lot of research from the author but nothing I can really take and use. It was a waste of my money and time. I don't know if I need to get to the end to really understand the value of the book but currently in the middle of it I am bored and I don't want to continue. So I decided to stop and got another book. I hope I am wrong and I hope there is something else that I am missing. Maybe I will give it another try later this year but currently I am very disappointed with this book.
2,Interesting but superficial,"There's very little substance here. The basic idea is laid out in the early chapters and most of the rest of the book are anecdotal examples. It is interesting and well-written, however; even if a rather superficial. Keep in mind also: the author has no credentials in psychology, neurobiology, or any other science. I believe he's a journalist.Overall, ""Blink"" is pretty lightweight stuff: good if you're stuck on a plane or need easy bed-time reading. Not for the serious reader, thought.Not recommended."
1,Zero stars,"If you want to be enlightened or entertained by this book like I did, you will be sadly disappointed. According to Malcolm, we must strive to rid ourselves of the horrible limiting stereotypes we have of African Americans and females, etc. However, while it is important that we do that, it is still okay to stereotype individuals experiencing Autism. In fact, he shares a few based on one study with one individual experiencing autism and expects the reader to be as ignorant of the subject as he is."
4,Understanding actions,"Helps you reads peoples actions, allowing you to understand what is coming at you, and avoid unwanted trouble."
3,Don't Blink Twice,"Gladwell did an excellent job researching people's inner sense about things, but the book seemed to meander from subject to subject with very little application to one's life."
1,Not Impressed,I purchased the book because of all the hype and was not very impressed. I suppose if you desire to overanalyze life you may enjoy it. I came away from the book with very little and was quite disappointed.
4,Fascinating,"I bought this book after seeing an interesting piece on CBS Sunday Morning. It is highly accessable read that delves into the nature of ""first impressions"" and ""gut instincts"". It leaves you with much to think about."
3,"Good Info, But Redundant And a Bit Dry...","I like the concept of the book which is basically telling you to trust your hunches, instincts and/or gut. Good advice that is good to hear from time to time lest we forget. That being said, the book gets boring after mentioning tale after tale of people trusting their instincts in certain situations. You need only read the first half of the book (probably not even that) and you pretty much have all the info you need.Buy it used. Read it. Then give it away. Good book - just a little redundant and boring towards the middle and the end."
3,He vacillated...,"Gladwell was on to something, and then he fell short of delivery when he vacillated with his latter stories and analogies. I think he should have sat longer on this before wrapping the writing up and publishing what looks to be unready. I found it to be weak in foundation and annoyingly confusing. If you have all the money to waste buy it, otherwise, look into more solid titles to spend your cash on."
1,Just horrible...,"I really wanted to like this book before reading it. I had heard so much about it and though perhaps it had potential, but alas, no. It was just horrible. I don't really have anything good to say about it. I just can't believe it's garnered as much media time as it has. Don't waste your time on this book."
1,Too many unecessary real life stories,"Real life examples (that in this book are long, repetitve and often not conclusive) should usually back up a certain theory (snap judgment, in this case) not totaly replace it, as the author did."
2,Disappointing,"I am one of those that absolutely loved ""The Tipping Point"". However, ""Blink"" seems more to be a series of anecdotes in search of theme instead of, as in Tipping, a new insight into how things work, supported by a series of examples. The cover ""looks like Blink"" but the text is a far different creature. Wish I would have spent the time rereading Blink...."
2,Should have stayed an essay,"Way to long for the content delivered. Essentially one big idea; experience, and I guess a little personality typing, makes for solid ""gut"" decision making. So much for the old saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"". If these ideas are implemented in the business world (I am an executive in the computer software industry) I guess it could lead to some real decision making efficiencies. On the other hand I can see the ""shoot from the hip types"" using Blink to justify their ongoing lack of elbow grease! By the way, the Tipping Point by the same author is a 5 star read....can't win them all."
3,"Wow, that was great!","I had heard about this book for a long time, so I raced on over to the website and took a long, hard--oh, I mean a short, easy blink at it. I'm not sure what it's about, but I'm sure I don't want to read it. Well, I mean, I did read it, but just really, really fast. It was great! By the way, since I both did and didn't read it, and chances are its an average book, I gave it a 3! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
2,Overrated drivel,"The basic idea of the book, repeated over and over again, is that sometimes people make decisions in the blink of any eye. Some of the decisions are good, and some are bad.Profoundly superficial throughout, but well-written and kudos to Mr. Gladwell for trying."
1,Obvious observations are not that interesting,"After reading this book I felt like saying, yeah, so what? The observations within are completely self evident to anyone who has taken the time to think about them and his conclusions based on these observations are nothing new either."
2,Not worth the money,"This book was an easy enjoyable read, but I haven't gotten anything new out of it. If you are a reader of ""pop"" writing, you might enjoy it and find it informative. I was looking to learn something new, and I was dissapointed. At the end, it wasn't worth the money I paid for it."
1,"Disjointed fluff. Had potential, never delivered.","Bits and pieces are interesting. Especially for anyonewho knows nothing about human physiologicalresponse under pressure. By the same token, ifyou *don’t* know anything, this bookwill be very confusing.Before (or instead of) try:In the Gravest Extremeby Massad F. AyoobAyoob Files: The Bookby Massad F. AyoobTactical Edge: Surviving High-Risk Patrolby Charles RemsbergI mention these books particularly sinceMr. Gladwell makes the Diallo shooting such aprominent part of his book. Frankly, almost anybook on industrial safety would make a bettersubstitute for this book. “Blink” & Mr. Gladwellkilled a lot of trees and spilled much ink tonever quite manage to say:More training leads to fewer accidents."
5,Excellent read for an insight into the cognitive and emotional mind for humans,"This book definitely explains the unexplainable. We sometimes choose logical reasoning over intuitions which leads to mistakes and even catatrophes. But the small voice inside your head saying 'yes' or 'no' to our decision making is right most of the times. This is especially true when we have less information about the decision process. Whether it be as small as buying clothes or as big as investing in a new business, the intuitive feeling can be a better guide as it is based more on experience and observation. Im marketing, that is how consumer behavior has been identified when they switch brands or buy an abolutely new product without any logical reason associated with it. The book definitely reconfirmed my conviction of 'gut feeling'."
3,"Frankly, I prefer ice cream in a box...","Some interesting thoughts here. Unfortunately, he makes a good case for the ""tyrrany of the majority"" school of sales and marketing, which for those of us who don't march to the beat of the mainstream, is without solace. Armies of market researchers test political language for effectiveness and have found that the term ""pro-life"" sells better than ""anti-abortion,"" that ""climate change"" can be more effective than ""global warming."" The A-B-Cs of how to manipulate the public-- how to ask the question in order to get the answer you want. And all in the name of, ""give the public what they want,"" leaving us with the same moral compass as that of a crack dealer. Welcome to Modern Capitalism 101. Is this a good thing? Not if you like your ice cream in a box..."
2,Blink AND miss it...,"I picked up this book because it had reviews written in the jacket stating that ""I couldn't put it down"" by qualified reviewers. Well, I could and did put it down. I skimmed many pages because of boredom and lack of merit.If you're interested in this topic in general, find another book about developing your intuitive self, because that's really what ""Blink"" is about, even though the word intuition doesn't come up..."
4,Great book,What a great perspective. It really gets you to start looking at what we are truely quick thinking or actually judging.
4,Great,"Very interesting and informative. It's a pretty quick read as well. I recommend this book, especially the part describing Ekman and his work."
3,Malcom Gladwell On A Roll,If you have enjoyed any of his other books you will like this one too . . . the premise is interesting and has opened up another perceptual window. The stories relating to test marketing point to revealing how we consumers are studied and manipulated. I have recommended it.
5,A must read,I don't know even how to begin to discrube this book. It is smart and I promisse you will learn something new. I would like to borrow Nike's slogan - Just read it.
4,Transaction and book review,Perfect transaction and am into the book for 25 pages and it is great and very interesting not boring at all!
3,Great start but weak conclusions,Overall the theory and analysis are interesting and the stories to support Gladwell's theory is interesting. I enjoyed the studies that were done and all the research for the first half to three quarters of the book but ultimatly the conclusion was incomplete and without a lot of hard core statistics to support anything.
3,Blink,Interesting but not outstanding.....nothing really ground breaking..... mostly thoughts you have had..
3,Very Thorough,"This book is a ten ton hornet's nest dropped smack dab in a city full of people allergic to hornets. The book starts out good. There's some bit about a statue. I never get a really good fix on what's happening in Blink. I recommend this book only for readers who have the time to delve into a really good story without needing excitement every page. All in all, except for a few missteps, this rip roaring yarn delivers the goods."
2,Interesting writing but doesn't deliver a point,"It's kind of like an example in the book: the doctors get sued for medical malpractice because they don't talk to patients as nicely, not because they make more mistakes than others.I keep reading the book because it presents some interesting information in good writing, not because the information presented justifies the book title or I agree with Malcolm's claims.To its credit the book can provoke some thinking, but after my thinking I'm not convinced of what it tries to say. Many studies referenced in the book lack some important pieces to be convincing (e.g. showing that experiments constructed based on the negative theory yield consistently different results), while others prove much less than what Malcolm claims they prove."
3,Something special for those in criminal justice,"This was a quick and enjoyable read that helps to explain why snap judgements are so pervasive and sometimes valid, othertimes not. Of particular relevance to those in law and policing are the sections implying how deeply imbedded prejudice is. The analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing and other police shooting incidents (at the end of the book) was excellent because it makes accessible to the general public that the problem is ameliorable through better training, that it is not just demon cops or demon criminals."
5,Amazing and timely,"I train communicators/educators at parks, zoos, museums, historic sites and the like. This is a wonderful resource for people who continually attempt to assess an audience and decide how to best deliver messages about conservation of resources. Thin slicing as a concept explains intuition, that most amazing human quality. I recommend this to anyone who speaks, teaches, sells or studies people.Tim"
1,Better as a magazine article,"This was a book club selection that I forced myself to finish. I was very frustrated with this book as it said the same thing over and over again. If I ever hear the term ""thin-slicing"" again, it will be too soon!While some of the examples were good, there was just too much repetition. Basically, it reads like a textbook. I expected to learn how to use the information provided, rather than read the same examples over and over again. This information would have been better shared in a magazine article with a handful of examples. There is no way this book deserved the acclaim it has received. Do not waste your money."
1,Where's the beef??,"I picked up Blink solely on Gladwell's prior work, The Tipping Point. I should have allowed thin-slicing to work and passed this by.Oh, if you wish to read what dozens of other researchers have to say about snap judgements and why we make them, it is a passable read. However, if you are looking for the application in your own life...look elsewhere.Along about page 100, I wanted to put it down because it seemed to have little to say. Another thin-slice I missed. By the time I got to the end of the book, I felt like my time had been wasted...not to mention the money. The good news for me is that I got the book at a considerable discount.I agree with one of the other reviewers here, i.e., ""take a nap, instead..."""
1,Blink is Malcolm's Way to Bling,"Ok! Now I read this book and thought it would be something totally out of this world (considering the buzz about it everywhere and nearly every excutive I meet citing terminology from it), but after reading it, I feel cheated out of the money I spent on it. So what does this book teach you? In one word ""nothing"" other than relating a whole spread of stories about people who can take instantaneous decisions. It is very ironical that Gladwell who exhorts to not overanalyse things spends so much time himself on the topic.Bad read for people who aim to learn things, more suited to people who are accustomed to reading publications that provide more gossip and little useful information. I think folks who shop the HSN will identify very well with the Blink way of decision making."
2,Left waiting for the goods.,"I thought the examples were good. If the research was accurately presented, it was compelling. The problem I had with the book is that it never presented any information on how one can work to develop one's own ""blink"" ability. There is the suggestion that it is possible to develop this capacity. I felt like a salesman had gotten me all excited about the features of this new, fabulous, remarkable car, then walked away from me refusing to work with me to buy it. SUMMARY: A big buildup to a big let down."
2,Nowhere near the Tipping Point,"Blink is disappointing.The theme is good. The value of snap judgments and thin-slicing is useful. And enjoyable. And entertaining.So what is wrong?Well, Gladwell says it all in the first 5 pages. The rest of the book is examples, and more examples and many more examples.He should have realized that we will 'get it' in a blink. And then left us alone. Except for the beginning, the book is probabaly aimed at satisfying the minimum word count for publication.Just read the reviews and summaries. The book has nothing to add."
2,what a disappointment,"I have been a major Malcolm Gladwell fan for years. But for all of the hype this book has attracted (and that might well be part of the problem), this one doesn't even come close to meeting the standards of his past efforts in terms of the calibre of the research, fresh perspective, new insights and writing. I have found that much of his work in The New Yorker of late falls short on the same counts. Perhaps he has forgotten that less is more and that his fans expect him to meet the high bar and standard he set for himself in the past? Or maybe someone should tell his publisher to stop hounding him for more books that don't make the grade to fill their pipeline?"
2,Interesting anecdotes. Lacks conclusions.,"The author references some very interesting studies, including how one professor is able to predict with 95% accuracy whether or not a married couple will still be married in 15 years by observing the couple for 1 hour and identifying some key behaviors. Overall though, the author never forms conclusions that can be applied to life. After reading the book, I wonder to myself, how am I better informed about making snap judgements than I was before? I honestly don't think I am. Good start to the book. Poor finish. Also, many of his anecdotes are lengthier than they need to be. All-and-all, it's thought-provoking, but not instructional at all."
3,A Light Read at Best,"This book is nothing more (or less) than an intriguing and entertaining collection of anecdotes. Gladwell presents these as examples of how a finely tuned unconscious can make near-instantaneous decisions that are superior to the results of extensive information-gathering and analysis. Unfortunately, nothing of any substance is offered in the way of how to train your mind to ""thin-slice"" or how and when to trust it (Gladwell points out that the unconscious can also be disastrously wrong). Perhaps the author has left that for his next best-seller?"
2,Massively Overrated,"This book is a classic example of how good editorial style masks the flaws of poor writing. The thought leadership in Blink could fill a postcard--at most a sheet of note paper, if you wrote in big, loopy cursive. But Gladwell's anecdotes are entertaining (if loosely tied to the premise) and his prose clips along (if repetitively), making for a mildly entertaining read.The first half of ""Blink"" is about why you should trust your instincts (the orchestra story). The second half is about why you shouldn't (the Amadou Diallo story). And very little effort is made to reconcile this self-canceling arrangement. As for the promised ""how to improve"" and ""how to overcome"" sections, they largely fail to materialize.On a positive note, the book is self-fulfilling in one way. My first thought when I saw Blink is that it was another phatic suit-narcotic. Now that I've read it, I can confirm empirically that my instinct was correct."
2,Use the second half of it as a sleep aid,"This book is 50% ""thin slicing"", 50% lesson on stereotyping, and no real explanation on how to improve our already innate ability to thin slice. ""Don't rush to judgement without a sufficient knowledge of the subject and don't question yourself too much if you have sufficient knowledge of the subject"". That's pretty much the whole book in a couple sentences."
3,I think many people made some snap judgments about this book,"Unlike many of the unpopular reviews Blink has received on Amazon, I enjoyed it. While much of the information about our ability to make snap judgements versus using logic is not ground breaking information, Gladwell uses interesting examples and case studies to support his points; he successfully demonstrates how our intuition can be both useful in making decisions, yet harmful and ridden with stereotypes.The experiment which includes subjects who were asked to judge strangers' characters by visiting their dorm rooms (subjects observed belongings, judged how clean the room was, etc) was fascinating; the strangers who viewed the rooms were more accurate in judging character than the closest friends of the dorm inhabitants."
2,A shrine to Statisticulation!,"An effusive monologue fortified with contrived oversimplifications does not make something factual or profound. In the end - I am right back where I started - only slightly chagrined for expecting to have gleaned some cogent insight regarding the recent advances in cognitive science in exchange for time invested.Granted, he's a deft writer. However, if you've had a college level introduction to psychology - you will struggle holding back natural questions that one would assume he would address in the succeeding pages - but no. Consequently, your ""bovine excreta detector"" will(or should) remain illuminated throughout the entire book."
3,Where's the beef?,"Blink is an entertaining read. Lots of interesting stories and anecdotes. It was also a quick read. Nothing too terribly deep or thought provoking to slow down for and contemplate. The actual ""lessons learned"" are few and far between, and not well tied together. I did find the book changed my perspective somewhat, but not in a significant way."
3,Just Okay,"I was really excited to read this, but I thought it was just okay. He kept repeating the same idea over and over. It was one idea stretched ad infinitum. I don't regret having read it, but I still don't think it's brillian by any means."
3,Interesting read on subliminal reactions.,"I enjoyed reading this book for understanding how humans make subliminal decisions during an on-going decision process. The research showed results of what some call the 6th sense.The first three quarters of the book was interesting to read since the author was writting about the ""blink"" concept in our minds and actions and backed it with different examples.The one example that I thought was interesting was the commander beating the computer in simulations, although another insight to that was how humans are enhancing computers to start thinking like our ""blink"".The last chapters of the book were not interesting since it seemed the author ran out of examples and kept repeating himself, and started writting more about technical data."
3,Food for thought - and action,"The first 100 pages sped by in virtually the blink of an eye. They gave me a significant amount to think about, and how I could particularly apply the concept of adaptive unconsciousness (thinking without thinking) in my business. In fact I have already begun to explore how a simple prompt can be imbedded within a process to unconsciously produce a desired end result.If you have ever said, ""If I only get a single good idea from it, the book would be worth it."", then a) buy and read Blink, and b) set higher expectations.I am giving this book three stars because the second half moved slowly, and I have read a few other books recently that I thought provided even more food for thought - and action."
4,fascinating read,"This book makes for a very enjoyable and illuminating read, full of fascinating ideas and information. There is no explicit theory that Gladwell relies on, and neither does the book make any clear cut conclusions. This however should not be looked upon as a flaw-rather I am of the opinion that Malcolm's sheer enthusiam for genuine discovery and making these ideas accessible, makes this an extremely gratifying book to read. Gladwell is an immensely gifted writer, and his narrative skills are superb. This book is defintely worth a read."
1,Possibly the worst book I have ever read.,"I read Outliers and I decided to buy Blink as well. It seemed like a good idea. BLINK is possibly the worst book ever written and believe you me, i will return it to amazon for a full refund. I have never felt so strongly about a book.THERE ARE NO LESSONS LEARNED from this book but mere long and boring examples of fast thinking. OH GOD !If I can save one person from buying it, my job is complete !"
2,Don't believe the hype.,"I'm sorry, I must be way out in left field or somewhere. I missed something. I stayed with the boring statistics but Life is short, so get to the nitty gritty, and give us what you promised. Unfortunately the author doesn't follow through. It's been referred to as a hunch, a sixth sense, even just a feeling. And we're probably all familiar with this stuff. Nothing new here at all, however, it would have been nice if a smidgen of information regarding how one could use the information reliably was provided as promised. Who are they that give high ratings to this ilk. Hey, I want my money back."
2,So what's the point?,"It starts out very nicely, it makes you to read more and more in the beginning. However, as I was turning pages after pages, I lost the main point. When I reached the conclusion part, I said to myself... so what was the point of this book? This book had too many examples and yes it's fun to read results of those psychological experiments and real life examples but they were just too much, I coudln't connect the dot at the end."
1,possibly the worst book i've ever read,the logical extension of the author's contradictory thesis is essentially that prejudice and thoughtlessness are better tools for judgment than deliberation and evidence. what would gladwell make of racial profiling? isn't that blink? and aren't most the examples he gives the results of EXPERTS' informed judgment and NOT blink? the only reason this book got published is Gladwell's connections.
1,"Blink -- a good title, but...","A better (and I think, more accurate) title would be Bllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllink.It actually put me to sleep on several occasions, then I just gave up and quit reading it."
2,Great Book For Those With No Education,"I think this book would be a pleasurable and interesting read for those of you who have never taken a psychology or biology course in college (or even high school). I am very interested in the human mind and have taken a few psychology courses in college, and I thought that this book would enhance my knowledge. Unfortunately, there was absolutely nothing new that I took away from this book. It was basically an over-simplified repition of things taught on the very first day of an introductory psychology class. If your time is valuable to you and you really want to learn something substantial on the subject, don't bother with this book."
5,Great Follow-up by Gladwell,"If you liked Tipping Point, you'll love Blink. Same writing style, completely different topic. Gladwell is terriffic - in my opinion the best - at making his research come alive through his convincing writing style. He gives great insight into how we think, great statistics and studies to support his theories, and ultimately - as only he can - makes the light bulb go off over your head. If you like smart, well researched and convincing books... read Blink."
2,a flash of insight doth not a book make,"This book is based on the observation that, for better or worse, we make decisions in the blink of an eye and that the ability to ""thin slice"" information is often crucial for timely action. This is all well and good, but I was hoping for information on how to cultivate this skill, avoid misusing it, etc. All the book gives is example after example, after example. Might be worth reading if you've never thought about it before."
2,Wasting Time so thinking is not possible...,"My sister recommended I get this product and I generally take her advice, so I jumped on this without thinking. I am easy to please, a good story or meaningful self help idea is always appreciated.Having said that, I would not recommend this product. It felt to me as if the author was writing a PhD dissertation with this audio. He went into such colorful detail on tangential themes in order to attempt to relay his points that it became difficult even in the car to sit and listen to. His points were not that difficult to relay, but one got the idea that he had to fill space/time, and a lot of it. That is exactly what he did.Unfortunately, I can't even say that his ideas were very creative. It was a serious chore to listen to the 6 or so CDs, I NEVER would have sat and read this material.For those people that prefer to get to the meat of a subject and do not have the luxury of having immense amounts of time needlessly wasted, I cannot recommend this product."
4,Should you read this book? You already know the answer to that!,"Our mind, faced with a life threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Narrowing allows to focus. In good decision making, frugality matters. Even the most complicated of relationships and problems have an underlying identifiable pattern. Less is more. Overloading the decision with information makes picking up that signature harder, not easier. To be a successful decision maker, we have to edit. Malcolm Gladwell learns that thin-slicing is doing just that. Blink is about the process of editing unconsciously. The book is a fun read as the writer is a great story teller and is able to translate several research fields to wonderful stories."
4,my review,I found this book to be very good and well written. It really made you think about how a person makes split decisions and what influences those decisions.
2,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,The third tape in both copies I received was from the abridged version while the rest were from the unabridged.
3,Blink,"This book contains some useful insights, but like many other books I've read lately, the back half seems to be filler to make the book thick enough."
2,Interesting but pointless as no concrete solutions to take away,Interesting enough but to add any real depth and concrete info Mr. Gladwell should do further research into the conscious and unconscious minds. The entire book discussed the surface matter (Blink) but without any clue about the actual foundation (namely the conscious and unconscious minds). I was very disappointed with the book as there was no significant conclusion or something concrete I could take away that would have meant the time I used reading the book was worthwhile. The book is just story after story that backs up his blink theory...I got it after the first 2 and did not need to read another 20 all saying and proving the exact same thing. Meaningless and pointless and yes I'm disappointed because this was my first Gladwell book and it will definitely be my last.
3,Ok,"Some insightful, some scrambled ideas. Then again it could have been because I was reading three books at the same time.Pleasant reading, now I know why cops behave the way they do!!"
5,"Wonderful book, would recommend it to everyone!","Blink: The Power of Thinking Without ThinkingThis book was an absolutely amazing book. I finished it in one night. It is about people's ""snap judgement"", and how it effects our everyday life. It is amazing how in a split second we can make a judgement about something, and react without even thinking about it. A truely powerful and moving book. The author gives examples of ""snap judgement"" and the effects which made my jaw drop. I learned alot from this book, and am more careful about how I perceive things.-Jenn"
3,"Interesting, but thin","I enjoyed reading this book, the language is easy and the subject interesting. I do however think that for so long of a book, there isn't much substance."
3,"High Expectations, Unmet","Blink was a bit of a disappointment. After reading other reviews and learning about the author, I expected a book full of great insights and anecdotes. Instead, I found a book of few significant insights and fewer interesting anecdotes. The beginning of the book started strong, but by mid-way, I felt as though the author had already used up his best material, and the remaining pages were simply filler. In places, it began to read like my college textbook from Social Psychology 101. Mr. Gladwell should have waited until he had more to impart, and included the best parts of this book as a chapter or two in his next, more complete work."
5,BUY IT!!!,Anyone that enjoyed tipping point needs to get this. I skipped over it a couple of times in the bookstore until I finally decided to spend my giftcard on it. It is a great hub of ideas that deal with how we can develop & depend on our instincts. I've already found myself using the ideas in this book at work to justify some of my approaches. I've also photocopied a chapter & distributed it amongst like-minded coworkers to convince them to read it. If you need a free mindmap of this book or 'tipping point' please email me at kharsakk2000@yahoo.com
1,waste of paper,"In the 'blink' of an eye, I knew this book would be a waste of my time, yet I continued to read it because I wanted to give it a chance. After all, everyone and their mom was raving about what an 'enlightening' experience this book was. Gladwell does little more than give new examples to old ideas, and I'm not really sure if he thinks split-second decisions are a good thing or a bad thing. I quit reading after the chapter about Van Riper's big victory, so maybe all the interesting stuff is in the end of the book (I wouldn't know because I kept falling asleep by this time). This book was overrated. If you want to hear a bunch of mindless psychobable, just watch the Dr. Phil show (cbs 4et,3ct)"
2,Nothing special - Just read the book jacket notes.,"Gladwell rambles on for 200 or so pages, yet never makes a solid argument.This book could have been edited down to 5 pages.You'll learn as much from book jacket as you will from the book."
3,Not what I expected.,"I purchased this book right when it came out. I usually like to wait until books come out in paperback before I buy them, but I was so intrigued by this author and book, that I purchased it right away.What I found, was the book is written at a very basic educational level. Because I have a BA in Psychology, I have already heard about most of the phenomenon's he discusses in the book. So, most of the book was a repeat of my undergraduate social psychology course. Also, most of these phenomenon's and methods for testing have technical terms in psychology. Instead of using any of these terms, he makes up his own terms as if he read a few research papers and then decided to write an entire book about a subject that he doesn't know a lot about.If you didn't go to college, or haven't had any psychology courses, then you will probably enjoy this book. But, if your background is similar to mine, then avoid reading this book. It reads like really bad cliffs notes from an old textbook."
2,Not a must read book,"Let me start by saying that each chapter in the book is very interesting, easy to read and engaging. A real page turner from this point of view.Now, having said that, as a whole I couldn't see what was the author getting at through the book. The book starts with the premise that some people can make a snap decision about something and be right, which is interesting. But then, the book goes into chapter after chapter of examples on exemptions to this. Which at the end feels like the original premise is completely false. The only conclusion I could get is that some expert in something might be able to make a quick decision and be right, which is mostly chance alone.So in essence I found this book to be mostly unimportant."
3,you dont have to think too much,I gave three stars because at least it was easy to read. But it lacked any real depth or insights.It is more like talking in a bar to some guy who has some insights but takes a very long time to convey them.For some light reading it is fine. I am not sure the book is usful in any real way.I suggest Predictably irrational by Dan Ariely. It is also light and easy to read but you may come away with an idea or two.
4,Good read!,"I enjoyed reading this book. It was a fast read too. Malcolm, as always, writes very well. Lots of great information packed in this book. It was worth my time."
4,Malcom 100 %,"Nice book to understand our emotions while we are deciding about very complex subjects, and narrated by a genius writter as Malcom !"
4,Finished strong,Got this book from a reading list for a Critical Thinking class I attended. I struggled through the first couple chapters of the book thinking the support for the conclusions to be rather weak. But as I got further in I was finding it more interesting and meaningful. The book finished strong. I've since purchased a couple of the books referenced in Blink. I gave away my original copy and will buy another. I thinking my second reading will put the first few chapters in a much better light.
2,Lame,"A book obviously intended to entertain as opposed to educate. While the premise is interesting, the science does not support the jumps that Gladwell makes. Read Damasio, Baars, or even Dennett to get a better idea of recent brain science from people actually in the field."
3,Thinking in a blink,"The writing was very good and kept my attention and the book was enthralling. The whole point was how our mind is so powerful that a lot of times it can make instant decisions better than if we thought on something for a long time. It taught that ""gut instincts"" are a lot of times our brain making subconscious decisions based on our past knowledge and experience.Also the book showed how prejudice and ignorance can also cause the wrong instant decisions. It is a good read but it really had no final big revelation."
3,"Anecdotally enjoyable, but not convincingly deep","This is a subject of great interest to me: what kind of thought goes on that we are not ""conscious"" of. What powerful, parallel algorithms are executed by the brain, but outside of the step-by-step process we call rational thought. The anecodotes are great and give a real feeling for the wonders of the mind, but Gladwell's analysis seems a little sketchy. The fundamental criticism is that the experts he discusses have spent years learning their unconscious skills. Gladwell is obviously aware of the theory of learning, how sequential thought eventually gets turned into pattern-matching parallel systems in the brain, but the tone of the work is more ""magical"". This makes for fun writing, but leaves you feeling a little disappointed. I would really rank this as 3.5 stars...it is better than average, but there are lots of 4 star books out there one could read instead."
3,Stimulating book .... left me wondering for more,"Second reading from Gladwell, with first one being ""The Tipping Point"", naturally. I am almost finished with this book so I might be doing a premature review. The book starts off strong, and captivates your attention from the start - the observations on small details and sub-conscious thinking that goes on in our brain is fascinating. I just wish the experiments listed were a bit more specific; as in the test environments, and all the control subjects. Sometimes I wonder well, did they look at this scenario vs. that one? I wonder (just slightly) if some of the conclusions might not be a bit premature. It is however an extremely stimulating read. I do like this type of modern pyschology and I do like how well the author writes. I do recommend it."
3,"I'm glad I read it, but....","Whereas 'The Tipping Point' seemed to lose me in how the total arguement was strung together, 'Blink' got a little tedious in that it spoon-feeds the storytelling yet never seemed to go anywhere. I consider it a quick, easy read and therefor worth the time and money invested. On the other hand, I want to say that it lacked depth even though I can't logically explain why that is. Certainly there are enough examples presented throughout and each was thoroughly over-explained. (Ugh.) Still, I finished the book wanting more...a stronger connection or something. The entire book felt like the build-up to a grand denouement that never arrived. It doesn't live up to the hype so just read it with realistic expectations. It *is* entertaining, let's leave it at that. ('The Tipping Point' was a much more satisfying read.)"
2,Stretching it to the max,"Like the author's ""Tipping Point"", ""Blink"" gives a fascinating hypothesis that will change your marketing perspective dramatically and forever, whether you're pushing yourself or a product.The only problem is: in both books, Gladwell's unique, little brainstorms could easily be reduced to about 25-30 pages without losing a thing. Once his theory has been expressed and examples given, there is not much else to say, but Gladwell goes on and on and on...and on. I have to admit, I could not make it all the way through either title. I felt like I was being repeatedly beaten over the head with the same information, just formatted in different ways.Would have made a great, A+ school report, but a book??? Now THAT'S marketing!"
2,An Okay Read,"Some insightful stuff, but not a lot earthshattering. Intuitive listening is the principle, and some time spent on how that is used against you (not actually your intuition, but basic assumptions that have you make snap judgements).The key is to be able to distinguish between intuition and preconceptions. It takes awareness, the book does not provide means to develop this. Instead it merely documents the phenomenon.There's probably a lot better material to spend your reading time on. Like The Tipping Point, I think the concept can be garnered quickly, you really don't need to read a whole book to get it."
3,Fast Read - Keeps You Interested,"Gladwell, following up on his big literary hit, ""The Tipping Point,"" cranked out another interesting life/leadership/decision making book in ""Blink."" The premise is pretty simple, go with your gut, and heart, before you go with your head. He gives example after example of research that shows your instinctive reaction is better than your thought out response. I agree, but also have known this since 2nd grade when our teachers told us to go with the first answer that we put down.Gladwell rightly also makes the point that these gut decisions can be patently wrong as well, getting into race relations and gender among other topics. The book kind of fades at the end after a strong start. Probably could have been 50 pages shorter. Anyway, you will enjoy most of this book - Joseph Dworak"
1,Blink stinks...,"I've never seen a more transparent effort to cash in. This is a (really) dumbed down psych lite book about nothing. At times, Gladwell's effort to make a strong point in confusing (I suspect there is no point). At other times, he provides mini-overviews of the examples discussed in the book in case we couldn't remember them...There is nothing interesting and nothing to gain from Gladwell's flimsy theory about ""thinking without thinking."" If you're interested in the thesis ""the power of thinking without thinking is so strong unless it's a situation where regular thinking is required,"" buy the book. Because that's all there is to it."
2,"Worthy of a magazine article, but not a book","Great concept, but the book is simply too repetitive. After the first few chapters, you get the point - gut decisions are about as good as long, thought out decisions. It would've been a nice magaizine article, but didn't justify an entire book."
3,So what advice to I take home?,"The book is a very easy read and the lessons are absolutely fascinating. Some of the insights about humans, how they think, how they interact and how they make mistakes are downright scary. Unfortunately, I am left wondering what to do about it. If people make judgments in 2 seconds then how do I prepare for my next job interview? when should I work hard to overcome my gut feel about something and when should I just trust it? How would I do it anyway?...There is not a person whose life is not affected, on a daily basis -- both on the receiving and giving end -- by the phenomena described by Gladwell. Anybody who wants to influence people needs to be aware of Gladwell's warnings. For the real lessons, however, we will need to look elsewhere."
2,"Fast reading, nothing profound","The basic ideas of Blink are that people make snap judgments, some people are good at it, sometimes snap judgments reflect prejudices, sometimes too much information can cloud thinking, using both snap judgments and deliberation can be effective, and it's never too late to give up our prejudices (well, that's how Thoreau put it). Gladwell documents these banalities with anecdotes (some interesting, some not) and bits and pieces of marketing analysis and/or research.Really, there isn't much more to say about it than that. There is nothing here that is groundbreaking or original. In essence, this New Yorker writer wrote an extended magazine piece and put it out as a book. I think a better title would have been Snap!, but I'm not a marketing analyst and that's just a hunch!Borrow it and pass it on."
2,Nowhere near as good as his previous work,"This book seems to have been written only because of the success of the Tipping Point, not because of a worthwhile subject matter. It jumps from facts, to anectodes, without a strong enough argument. After reading the first one, I was very disappointed."
2,deluding,"Blink is the diet version of Gladwell's previous book: The Tipping Point. It is neither original nor thought provoking. The bottom line of the book is that we are influenced by our snap judgments in our everyday life. However, some persons are more capable than others in that craft. Yes, that's true. And Cialdini's book: ""Influence. The Psychology of Persuasion"" says the whys and the hows."
4,The logic behind intuition,"This book attempts to provide insight into intuitive decision making. Gladwell starts strong with his prescription for data selection reinforced with fascinating case studies, but the book loses steam. I definitely prefer his previous book, The Tipping Point, which is more substantive. For solid information on decision making and optimal choices using logic with intuition, read Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self."
2,"If you have the urge to read this, ""blink"" and maybe you won't","I thought that this book, though well-written and easy to read, didn't really teach me much that was useful. Perhaps my fault for setting expectations too high, but I thought this book would offer insights into how WE can go about improving these gut-decisions that we sometimes have to make. I don't think I got anything like that. Outside of some interesting data points on how accurate some people's instincts seem to be or how, with training, we can discern some of the causes underlying some of our decisions and prejudices, I thought this was just trivial."
2,Blink and its over,"Gladwell spends half the book telling you how we are capable of making incredible, enlightened deductions in an instant thanks to our subconscious. He leaves you hoping the next half of the book will tell you how to harness and refine those deductions so you can use them in everyday life and decision making processes. Instead he goes on to reveal how we override our initial intuitions with conscious thought, and interestingly, vice versa. He ends by giving examples of how we make errors in judgment by relying on our intuition too much. So what was the point? Not the treatment on the subject I was hoping to receive. Basically he says the subconscious is capable of powerful things. Great. Now buy a book that talks more about how to use it to your advantage."
3,Liked this better than Tipping Point,"But, I didn't like tipping point. Anyway, Gladwell has some interesting points about how we reason and make decisions. First third of the book shows why we should trust our instincts, next two thirds shows why that's a bad idea. Not sure what he really believes. As with Tipping Point he expounds on some intersting social science studies that often but not always have something to do with the point he's trying to make at the time. The studies are interesting all by themselve, but sometimes I think they're there only to make sure the book has the requisite number of pages."
2,A sure hit in MBA programs,"What a bore! ""Blink"" is a grab bag of platitudes that leads absolutely nowhere. The core thesis is risible. The author basically argues that under the right conditions, humans make better decisions when they use their instincts. He then states that under the wrong conditions, decisions based on instinct can be disastrous. Jee-whizz, Malcom, thanks for the insight! The book is hype and empty of any valuable content; it will certainly become standard reading in MBA programs."
3,"Not bad, but....","_Blink_ is certainly an entertaining read, and the author does an excellent job of staying on track and using many different areas of study to buttress his major topic. However, the book never provides a payoff of WHAT should be done now. According to Gladwell, ""thin-slicing"" is good, unless it's not good. It's good when it works, but otherwise it's bad. There's no step forward here, and the only applications provided are the politically-correct ones that one could presume without even opening the text. It's a good book, but not the masterpiece that many seem to be seeing here."
3,"Good, but no prominent arguments","I enjoyed reading Blink, but don't think it needs your immediate attention.This is a book about judgments, snap/subconscious decisions, and what we can do to trust them or try to change them.I think that Blink flowed really well and had some good arguments, but I don't think there is anything new here. Nothing in this book is spectacular.Putting all of the examples together and analyzing them does have some interest, but there is nothing striking about Gladwell's arguments.I think that the idea behind this book is very important, but needs more work."
3,"It's not a bad book, but ...","definitely more of a ""rental"" (i.e. used) than a purchase. It's a quick read, starts off with an interesting notion, but the second half of the book didn't have much to say nor did it deliver a strong conclusion. There are some interesting stories in between, including evidence suggesting we are all biased in some ways, but nothing original. The bottom line here is that with experience, your intuition on areas of YOUR expertise improves. Wow."
1,"Blink, fall asleep, wake up and hopefully finish this book",The author's first book was pretty damn good. (The Tipping Point). here he attempts to tackle to subject of intuition and gut feeling but it never really suceeds. His writing style to constantly come back to an example he cited earlier made the book feel repetitive and burdensome.I wish that this book was better because the premise was pretty good. Too bad!!
3,Anecdote Souffle,"Mildly interesting, and certainly the easiest of reads. Of course Gladwell is a huckster, but like all hucksters he occasionally entertains. I suppose that warrants throwing a couple of bucks his way."
5,Interesting Book,I really liked this book. It made you really think how you react to people... Def a good read.
3,Fun Read and a Thought: Is This Why Bush Is so Popular?,"A fun read, but a little frustrating. Now that I know that I make decisions based on unconscious interpretations, how do I tap into that part of me (the ""locked door"") so I can understand and even change how I work?After the widespread media coverage on the passing of Johnny Carson last week--there was a day when you could see clips of the (still) wildly popular Johnny on TV again all day--it struck me that Johnny and George W. Bush have a similar look about them. And I had a flash of thought: might this be one reason why W. is so popular, because America is really voting for somebody who reminds them of Johnny and the ""good old days"" then?I sure blinked when I had that thought."
1,My Own Snap Decision,"What a load of tripe. I quickly figured out that this book isn't worth the money and made a snap decision not to buy it. Come on now, don't be gullible and think."
2,"Fun, but no cigar. Try elsewhere for a better look at","these ideas. I'd recommend instead (or in addition to) ""Art of What Works"" by William Duggan."
1,This book is worth a 2-second read.,"Gladwell's ""Blink"" tells us that we can learn as much in 2 seconds as we can from a detailed study. That summarizes his entire book. Spending any more time on his book will provide no greater insight. Take his advice - accept this 2 second summary of his book, and move on. There is nothing more to learn from reading it. Apply this to Tipping Point's basic idea - if a phenomenon achieves a certain critical mass, it will grow exponentially. Now you don't need to read Tipping Point either."
4,A Case for Irresponsibility,"A very interesting book that can help you learn to trust your own decision making processes. Teens often try to blame their behavior on other things or people. One of my favorites is, ""I blacked out and didn't know what I was doing."" While we are all responsible for our actions, our brains can go on automatic pilot from time to time. With this phenomenon laid out, we can learn to control our thinking a bit more than the average person who seems to always fly on auto. Also, Gladwell discusses intuition quite a bit and how if we listen to our deepest self, our decision making can really improve."
3,Interesting examples with little to no analysis,"First of all, let me say the examples Gladwell provides in the book are fascinating, from the war game general who succeeds despite having far less information to the police officers who misunderstood a situation.However, once he's done presenting the data, he has one short chapter of summary, then the book is over.I would've liked some additional analysis or other way of incorporating lessons learned into one's personal life rather that just given a collection of ""raw data""."
2,Disappointed.............,"I felt this book came as a highly rated ""Bestseller"" but I find I am disappointed. While I haven't completely finished the book yet it seems to contain several very long descriptive stories of how people behave according to their preconceived ideas. An interesting phenomena, but it gets beaten to death by the author. I have just received my order of ""Outliers"" and hope I enjoy it more than this one."
3,a tad disappointing,"this follow-up to The Tipping Point was a bit of a disappointment. There was a lot of good data in it, but I felt that his entire thesis was flawed. Its all about ""thinking without thinking,"" by trusting your ""gut."" Yeah, that always works out... there was some good data about folks who could read emotions by observing facial muscles, and how the mind operates when under stress, but otherwise it wasn't very thoughtful."
3,Have I leanrt how to trust my gut reaction?,"The first chapter was enthralling. It tells us how a number of art experts, using the latest available scientific techniques, failed to spot a fake whereas a few other experts, believing in their gut reactions spotted the piece of art work as a fake. Great start.But then the obvious question arose. We all know how our gut reactions, our instincts or 6th sense, call it whatever you might, have failed us in the past. How does one tell the real McCoy from the fake one? I was hoping that the book could help answer that question. It didn't.So what does it make this book? An entertaining read. That's all. It really hasn't changed my decision making process in life, and I doubt it will change anybody's decision making process in their lives either."
4,How and Why We Form First Impressions,"If you've ever wondered why or how snap decisions are made, this book will be of interest. Gladwell explains how controlled experiments have explained some of that mystery. He then goes on to illustrate how those quick judgments can err as easily as they can prove accurate; but, moreover, how it is somewhat possible to train the accuracy of our instantaneous judgments."
3,Disappointing in Comparison to his other works,"Having read ""Outliers"" and ""The Tipping Point"" I was excited to start ""Blink"". That excitement quickly subsided. The book starts out great. Gladwell does a great job of drawing the reading in an capturing their attention. The problem appears to be that he doesn't know what to do with the reader's attention once he has it. His other two books kept me hooked from cover to cover. This one lost me halfway through. Some of the examples he brings up in the book seem out of place to say the least. He also skips around a lot from example to unrelated example trying to make his point. By then end of the book, I wasn't even sure what his point was. I would definitely recommend ""Outliers"" and ""The Tipping Point""; however, don't waste your money on ""Blink""."
3,Thoughtful and thorough and repetitive,"The book was a good quick read. He has an easy writing style, but tended to dwell on points a bit too long for my tastes.In general he sought to discuss the power of thin-slicing situations. He successfully showed how its something everyone does subconsciously; sometimes to our advantage otherwise not as much. He includes a plethora of examples when ""first impressions"" save us misery, give us superior insight but contrasts them with examples of the opposite. He had also set out, according to his introduction, to discuss how to hone one's ""thin slicing"" ability, but here he fell short. The book had a very abrupt ending."
3,Not Gladwell's best effort,"Before purchasing this novel I had read Outliers and enjoyed the book so much I decided to pick up Blink. Gladwell's prose is very clean and straightforward, which leads to a quick and interesting read. Blink did have some intriguing chapters but as a whole, the book left much to be desired.The author attempts to elucidate how our subconscious quickly makes decisions in a real time environment. Further, the author draws the conclusion that more often than not we should trust our instincts and our ability to ""thin slice"". However, the book lacks the execution that is characteristic of his later novels.I would recommend this book to those who are interested in psychology because some areas contain merit and this book may be more attractive to those who are in the field."
2,Repetitive book of repetition. Whoops. Did I say repetition already?,"In theory, this book was good. It had a great concept, but it could have been explained in just a few chapters and not an entire book. The examples went on and on and on and on. I was bored with the book by the time I got to the end."
5,In the blink of an eye,Malcolm Gladwell did a great job explaining thin-slicing. His examples were very memorable and easy to connect with for the most part. I couldn't put this book down! I am going into education and find this book really interesting on how we can set up schema's and think so quickly. In this book I found out just how important our unconsciousness is. This book is great if you want to learn about how we have a reason for something but can't really explain it. It is also great if you are one of those people with a gut feeling and have no real reason for it. I would recommend this book to anyone. I want to read the tipping point I hope that it will be just as entertaining as blink!
5,Understanding and managing the power of unconscious thought,"Not just another self-help read, this book leverages research, statistics and ethics to suggest a path towards a healthier society. Well worth your time and money, especially for the therapized who ""run away"" (sensu Monty Python) from enlightment through blaming."
3,Blink some more!,"Ok I read the other book - Tipping Point and said I wasted my time so why did I read this one? Good question! In the end I was trying to figure out if my sometime ""Shoot from the hip"" method of decision making I use when under pressure is flawed or not. In the end Malcolm tells us in some situations yes it is perfectly reasonable to make a decision in a ""blink"" but in others more than ""one blink"" is necessary. Gee thanks for the insight.The best thing about the book it gave me renewed confidence in making quick decisive decisions. That in fact, there are many things that make up our decision making thought process and sometimes it's not possible to explain your answer. In other cases it would take a team of people weeks to prove your ""blink"" decision."
3,book review,"This book came in good condition; but due to some mail error, it took over a month to receive. I had to recontact the company to find out what had happened and when I would receive the book. I would not deal with this company again."
5,"Fascinating and Entertaining, A Must Read","I liked this book a lot. What I consider my gut, Mr. Gladwell considers ""Thin-slicing."" Stayed up all night to read, and glad I did. While it lacks in the self-help department, it does not really tell you what to do to become a better thin-slicer, it makes up for by superb storytelling and thought provoking essays.An interesting side note, I picked this book up because I was acquainted with an individual in one of the studies it uses. From listening to his best friend describing the relationship, I without any doubt put in my two cents from my thinly sliced comprehension aka ""gut"" - that the marriage is over. His best friend got angry and yelled at me for not understanding completely and my negative judgement. A month later they filed for divorce. A year later this book was published. I like that it uses their taped interaction many years ago as an example, because it validated my personal ""Snap judgement"" and lets me know my gut is doing a good job."
2,Blink....but not too hard,"This book has many great examples and is well written....that being said, his conclusions are all wrong. The conclusions are sooooo far off as compared to his examples that to claim this book as ""self-help"" is absolutely absurd. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone."
4,Don't Compare It To Tipping Point,"I like Malcolm Gladwell's writing style, but after ""The Tipping Point"" this book just didn't compare. The different elements of the book didn't seem to fit together as well.However, I do still recommend it...just keep your expectations at a normal level to begin with and you'll be happy at the end."
3,Worth a few hours,"This is a funny book, a welcome reprieve from the day's terrible news. It's worth reading, definitely; enjoyable."
1,Can it be any more tedious?,"It really does dawn on you somewhere in the middle of the book that Gladwell's intelligence is somehow borrowed, his examples redundant...He IS pushing his brand, his intellectuality, never quite making a solid point. The book is full of ""deep"" hmmm moments that never really amount to anything substantial. I'm glad I had the library copy (it would be a sorry waste of money).The moment I read about the involuntary subconscious association with the DOMINANT race, I knew Gladwell can't be taken seriously."
2,Not much there,"This book was mostly full of stories that illuminate the fairly obvious. Basically, the theme is that over-analyzing can often be worse than simply making a snap judgment. There is such a thing as too much information (especially when not interpreted correctly), and likewise, snap judgments are often wrong. How to find a balance? No answer in this book.I did find some of the stories and information entertaining, insightful, and perhaps slightly useful; but overall, I was glad it was a short book--I would not have finished it had it been any longer."
2,Blink Not,"It seems that this book is more about the DANGERS of ""thinking without thinking"" then the advantages. Maybe the first 50 pages are interesting stories of people acting on instant insight successully, but the rest of the book describes disasters from doing so. I was looking for insight on expanding this ability, not reasons not to.A short, easy, read, but confounding... Not what I was expecting."
4,enjoyable read,"This is a page turner. The book consists of several exciting stories on very interesting material (fake art, police brutality, marriage counseling, etc). The author shows a bunch of scientific trickery and experiements designed to demonstrate the power of _blink_ - split-second.However, there is hardly a moral to the story, or a coherent message in the book. The book isn't about ""thinking"" of any kind, and it certainly does not teach the reader how to think."
5,I knew all this intuitively :),This book reinforces what I knew intuitively already; some decisions are best made based on hunches. I enjoyed it a lot.
2,Repeated Theme,It stricks upon on good idea then proceeds to beat the idea to death. Short quick read.
2,A Bestseller dissapointment,Looking at the ranking on the best seller's list and hearing a few reviews I had high expectations for this one. Quite frankly the last two pages sum up the entire book quite succinctly. The stories are interesting but the author never brings out anything that instills a need for action. Sort of like reading a novel. :(
4,Insightful and entertaining,"This was a good, short, read with a lot of interesting facts and insightful thoughts."
3,What about quality of decision when timing is not crucial?,"The subject is good, not new. Many times experts can thin slice the available information can decide in a blink of a second . What qualities make them so good? or the other way around-what they missed?I think the experience that counts when thin slicing, making decisions in split seconds. But what about when the timing of the decision is not crucial? Law enforcement officers on patrol vs. Getty's KourosDoes the first impressions e.g. first decision, has impact when reconsidering the case again? How much bias do we have? Can the 'gut feeling' be changed?"
2,"Not as good as ""Tipping Point"".","I thin-sliced the cover of ""Blink"" and thought it would be as good as Tipping Point by the same author.I was as wrong as the cops mentioned in the book, while this is not a big waste of time, I didn't get anything new from this book."
1,Misguided Ideas,"At the time of a blink, I know this book has a very misleading title but it fits today's Americans' need. It suggests that you don't need to think but you can make right decisions. However, intuition or hunch actually comes from years of experiences. But today's society, we need to get rich fast and enjoy life and we need a reason to make a judgement without real thinking. The result will be disasterous. Blink should not be a substitute of years of experiences and hard work."
4,Plodders don't like this book.,"""Writing about Music is like dancing about architecture.""Laurie AndersonInstead of a phd thesis beating one dead horse after another, this is a book for those who 'get it' and get it right away. Whipping from one disparate topic to the next and then sinching them together beautifully doesn't make it a rip-off; it makes it readable, Not in a summer novel way. Readable like poetry that you want to take in again with a second read. For those who want a linear progression with detailed explanations, you won't like it. For those of you who find yourselves urging on your longwinded friends because you know what point they're getting at before they know it themselves, you'll love it. And those different thinkers are indeed, the very thesis of the book.The style is no accident; the style is the point itself. Lovely, really. I read it in a sitting."
2,BS,I would prefer to read something written by a philosopher who cannot write than by a writer who cannot think.
5,Will change the way you think you think,"I am a cop, and this book has helped my put the way I make decisions into an almost tangible form. It has changed the way I look at what is going on around me, and has helped me find ways to hone my automatic reactions. I second-guess myself less and less, and in turn is making my life easier. I am able to pick up the little warning flags that are everywhere when you look. You have to have an open mind when you read this book, or you will not get anything out of it."
3,Razor thin slices!,"I can't say I was mesmerized by this book; however, it was an interesting read. What I found most interesting was the virtual wars between the Day Traders and the General Officers. In retrospect, had the Generals approached the virtual war games with open minds, instead of impenetrable egos, they may have been better equipped for the current war effort. Honestly, I think Blink allows most people an opportunity to flirt with the idea of intuition. In the end though, I think we're all simply a collection of personal experiences. And while some of those experiences prepare us for the unknown, some of them do not! And without those experiences, you may need more than simple intuition to reach a proper conclusion. While common sense goes a long way, and blinking may be fun, in the real world, I think it remains prudent to blink, but verify."
2,Hijacking introductory psychology,"I had high expectations for this book because of reviews from my friends, but this book is basically a rehashing rip-off of any psychology course in high school. I am a psychology major and I was hoping for new ideas about how to judge things quickly with very little information, but the book ended up being a series of anecdotes about snap-judgment situations. The level of analysis was very poor and unoriginal, and the ideas were completely innocuous. Nothing in this book was interesting."
2,all over the place,I have heard many good things about this author. I like the fact that he grew out his hair during the process of writing this book. It started out really strong and then he lost me in the middle. Its about the re-discovery of his youth and the rules you learn more than intuition.
2,Anything new?,"I tend to agree with the reviewer, Loyd Eskildson, about this book. In essence, I have not gotten more than a couple of new ideas from this book, the rest are commonsense. Of course, your thin slices will get more accurate if you have more experiences and in depth knowledge of the area you're thin slicing. Hmmm ... tell me something new ..."
3,"Entertaining, but not enlightening","I'll make this short. Blink is an interesting book that makes for a great read while waiting at the airport or the like. My finace has a phd in neurological psych. and has revealed to me how Gladwell misuses some contemporary psychological theory to prove his ""real-life"" illustrations. Given that his notions are not qualified, it takes a turn from being entertaining to a viable option to watching NASCAR. Hard to believe this one is so highly rated honestly."
3,Not up to par,"After having thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's 'The Tipping Point', I eagerly awaited for this one to come out. I must say that I was quite disappointed. Whereas his first book captivated the reader with engaging ideas of many social phenomenons, this book seemed to lack an identity and purpose.An extreme viewpoint would be to say that this book was written primarily to ride the wave of the success of the first one. 'Blink' lacks the ingenuity and wit that Gladwell displayed in his first book."
2,"Blink, Blink and I am asleep","This book is a typical case of an author who finds a good idea but doesn't figure out how to deliver it. I have been working in Strategic Marketing for over 15 years and was very excited to receive and read Blink. I thought his last book was brilliant but don't waste your money on this one. Go buy yourself a drink instead. In a blink, without thinking. What a dissapointment this read is. Mr. Gladwell chooses all kinds of well known incidents, examples and dissasters to prove his ''Blink concept''. From the New Coke flop(come on Malcolm)to a Pentagon war games excercice. The general idea of the book is: Keep a balance between the emotional and rational parts of your brain when you make a decision. But that doesn't warrant a 276 page book and absolutely not being in the top 10 on the Amazon best seller list. I want to have breakfast now....Blink...Blink... Should I or should I not? My stomach says yes. C'ya."
2,Blink and Miss It.,"I can sum up this book in the following 3 points.1) the subconscious mind exists.2) Sometimes it can work for you, sometimes it can work against you.3) There is very little you can do about how it works.The end."
1,another overhyped psychology/management book,"this was a must have book according to management BUT it is just another fad series of cute new terms or thinking that has no merit as far as I am concerned. And I used ""blink"" to figure it out before I wasted time"
3,"not bad, but very little learned","the power of thinking without thinking... we always regret when our snap decisions went wrong. so basically i'm buying this book in hope to improve my ability to make right decisions within a very short period of time therefore reduce errors. the book tells you how your snap decisions are made, a lot of fun stories related to blink. but disappointly, after you finish all of those interesting-at-first-annoying-after-a-while stories, the book is over, done, no more... so if you are looking for a fun read, buy this book; if you wanna improve your snap decison making skills like i did, reading this book is just waste of time."
2,All Fluff - Waste of Time,"If are hoping to gain insight about ""rapid cognition,"" how we arrive at snap judgements or gut feelings you'll be disappointed. The book is almost entirely devoted to describing instances of snap judgements that either assisted or led people astray in their decision making. No great theories on how the mind does this or why.The startling conclusions in the book are that we make snap judgements and that sometimes they help us and other times they hurt us. I was expecting something more like Steven Pinker's work in ""How the Mind Works"" or his other books. This is nothing like those.Don't waste your time and money. Don't even bother checking it out at the library."
3,Snap Judgement Review,"Blink is about making an inital judgement and going with it. The author uses many different historical examples to illustrate his theory. I found a lot of the material to be very intuitive, but it was interesting to read a good sound philosphy and basis behind what most of us do as habit.Basically this book looks at the reason why we make our decisions, and I enjoyed it. I would have liked for him to have delved into the subject a little more and gotten into the deeper psychology of the matter.Overall, a good read."
1,Waste of time,"This book was, by far, the most redundant thing I have ever read. It would have made for an interesting article in a newspaper or magazine; however, the book itself is way too long and repetitious for its topic. I am very disappointed that I spent money on this item. Too bad my ""thin slicing"" is apparently terrible and could not help me on this purchase."
2,Long look at rapid cognition,"Blink is a very long look at rapid cognition, the science of intuition. The problem with this book is it's about 200 pages too long and I felt like I was reading a magazine article that wouldn't stop - every chapter was a reiteration of the preceding chapter. This book in a nutshell is as follows:1. We each have an innate, rapid, largely unconscious sense of reasoning; i.e., intuition.2. We could greatly benefit by listening to this intuition.3. This intuition can also hold our unconscious prejudices.4. Our rapid cognition can often be wrong and get us in trouble.Personally I found this all very interesting - just not 320 pages worth of interesting."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I'd like to echo the thoughts of other reviewers who've said Blink is merely a collection of anecdotes on how snap judgments can help us or harm us. Though interesting reads, these stories don't teach us anything we don't know already about intuition - Sometimes your instincts hit the bullseye and sometimes they fall completely off target. How do we know which instincts to trust? I was hoping Gladwell would provide an answer to this question, but found he really didn't."
5,Interesting concept book,"The book is part of a new genre - the short ""sum of articles"" around a concept. (Think Freakonomics for the most successful of the genre) In these essays, Malcom Gladwell covers why we make decisions so quickly, why they're frequently right, and how to work around the poor decisions we can find ourselves in.It's definitely not high science or a textbook, but it's good pop science. It'll only take a night or two to learn about our mind's ability to short-circuit our supposedly rational decisions."
3,Mediocre at best,"Gladwell is a writer for the New Yorker so it's not surprising that this entire book could have been summed up in an article. Gladwell basically says we should follow our instinct and concludes at the end that we shouldn't be judgemental at the same time. Wow, what insight! He gives some interesting examples which are what I enjoyed. It's a quick read though so you won't waste too much time even though the book is a little drawn out."
2,Blink and you missed it...,"It breaks my heart to write a negative review of a Malcolm Gladwell work. Tipping Point was incredibly easy to read and provided useful discussion and thinking points, however the lessons of Blink (if there are any) are difficult to apply and certainly impossible to substantiate, even after you plough through this work (which becomes tedious toward the end). Blink will not have anywhere near the impact that Tipping Point did (and, from here on in, comparisons to Tipping Point will for Gladwell be inevitable). The book is well-written and focused. I still ponder some of the examples give n in the book weeks later -- but a few of the stronger examples are painfully short on detail and their bond to the central theme (which, unfortunately, is obvious to anyone capable of having purchased the book) is fairly loose.Sadly, Blink reads as though Gladwell had less time, and less inspiration, in its composition. I have no doubt he'll make up for this on his next work."
2,"Waiter, Oh Waiter!","It's an interesting topic to ponder: how do we know things in an instant? In fact this topic has been pondered for millennia and studied extensively for the last fifty years. There are wonderful philosophical, religious, and scientific works on this topic. The knowledge and insights available are both broad and deep. This particular book, Blink, The Power of Thinking without Thinking, does not add anything new or insightful.While reading this book I felt as if I were at a business reception and found myself engaged in a one sided conversation with a nice fellow who went on way too long about how the mind works. My mind works. And what my mind told me was find a waiter, get another drink, and excuse myself. Never ending anecdotes, no matter how well intended, embellish a point, but do not prove it or provide a deeper understanding. That's the way Blink is. I cannot recommend it because it sheds no new light on an old subject and there are better works on the mind and cognition."
2,Synopsis: Intuition Works,"Blink is worth the read, but only for the paper back price. It's very easy to follow and a quick page-turner. However, it's a bit shallow.Blink's basic premises is: intuition is real, it's been scientifically proven, and you too can learn to use it. Most people feel there is something more to the ""gut feel"" or the ""intuition"" a person has. This show's that's true. The proof's Gladwell outlines are fascinating but the point is made too many times. However, I was disappointed to finish the book and not learn anything about honing one's own Thin Slicing capabilities.Read Blink, but borrow it from a friend or buy the paperback used."
1,"anecdotes with an overlay of pseudo-analytical mumbo jumbo; basically, an incoherent book","Virtually every supposedly analytical utterance is just an assertion with little logical basis. One could easily have interpreted the presented facts in any of a dozen other ways, drawing some other type of lesson. Basically, the author lays out dozens of anecdotes and then makes highly dubious remarks about decisions that were made. But it simply doesn't hang together in any coherent way. This is way, way over-hyped."
2,"If your looking to understand thought and intuition, look elsewhere","Gladwell is an entertaining writer, I'll give him that. I did enjoy reading this book. However, it's not about the substance for him. He is basically reaching for something we all sorta kinda know about, but is not at all scientific or expository. The best book on doing without doing, thinking without thinking, intuition, the sense of self, self-knowledge, and the mecahnics behind all of this, is, by far, God Without Religion by Sankara Saranam. Not only does it deliver what readers likely expect from a book like Gladwell's, but it does in the context of world-shaking issues. If you want to know what thought is, not to mention supermental knowledge, look elsewhere."
3,"Interesting, but doesn't leave much of an impression","Gladwell's latest is a breezy, enjoyable read that unfortunately left me wondering about the whole point of the book.The discussions of the way we intuit, or thin-slice things, can be fascinating. However, he makes it clear at other times that this can be a poor approach. I've got no problem with contradiction, but a little further explanation would have been nice.This felt like a book that could have been much longer, and one that could have gone deeper, instead of providing plenty of light, anecdotal incidents to prove a point. While it's one that you'll probably enjoy, it just doesn't leave you with much in the end."
3,Glorified Thesis,"The premise presented in Blink is interesting, and Gladwell certainly spins the research to support his position that the ""gut"" decisions we make are often the most important. However, Gladwell does little to make his point through the examples he uses, as he uses illustrations of individuals making decisions in their respective fields who have years and years of experience. OF COURSE these people will tend to make better/on-the-fly decisions than someone with little or no experience.This book read like a lengthy case study, supported by chapters of research and examples; not to mention, repetition - to drive his point home. The concept of Blink may have been better presented a'la three-part article series in Time Magazine or another consumer-facing publication. As a book, it seems to drag on unnecessarily."
3,Blink,"I blinked and did not see any empirical evidence that Gladwell's assertions hold ground. I was somewhat confused by the various ambiguities and the author's ""thin slicing"" theory and his leap of faith conclusions. In all fairness, this book is entertaining and is filled with fascinating anecdotes."
3,Should be readable at the blink of an eye...,"Having grown with this feeling that my 'first impression' is most of the times the one that counts, I've pushed the '1 click order' button before I could blink an eye (maybe it was the wonderful cover... yes, I know, don't judge a book...). I didn't take any nap while reading it, but I must confess reading sometimes slows down a bit, almost across an umberable point. If I was the editor, I'd do two things: make it 100 page long at the most (98 is a nice number) and I'd reshuffle the text in order to improve the reading speed."
2,WAY OVERRATED!!!,"The author spends an inordinate amount of time putting together anecdotes about situations in which people with extraordinary training in a given subject (for example, art) can determine when an item (e.g. a sculpture) is real or fake. So what. A well trained eye can determine a fake Rolex in the blink of an eye. If they are trained in what to look for and are intimately familiar with the details, then it should come as no surprise.What is MISSING is any advice, hints or other information to help the average ""Joe"" learn to put those abilities to work in the real world.Don't waste your time. But if you must, get it from the library without spending any money on it."
2,waste,"It basically took two simple ideas (your first reaction is often the decision you'll ultimately reach anyway which is fine until your subconscious and gut reaction leads to a serious consequence)that contradict each other , devotes 100 pages towards trying to justify each of the thoughts, and never ties the points together. A real disappointment."
1,BLUNK,"Perhaps it is simply ironic that so many pages are devoted to explaining something that happens instantaneously, yet still manages to miss the target. A disappointing book on a subject that should have been fasinating to write about and read. It is telling that that word ""instinct"" is nowhere to be found in the index of the book."
1,Just plain bad,"Thin slicing works, except when it doesn't.The premise is interesting, but Gladwell fails to actually draw any meaningful conclusion from his anecdotes. In fact, you could draw completely opposite conclusions from the same ""data"". This is popular science writing at its worst. Just plain dumb."
3,"A series of fascinating anecdotes, but little synthesis","I've never been quite as disappointed with such a page-turner. I give this book 4 stars on pacing, style, and level of interest, but 1.5 stars on synthesis. The author has a remarkable ability to captivate the reader with a series of stories that are at times quite technical, but he fails on his promise in the introduction to show us when to trust our first impressions, and when they lead us astray. What was it about the kouros-statue experts that made their first impressions right, but made the NYPD officers who shot an innocent man 41 times wrong? The author never really tells us. In the end, the author seems to imply that our intuitions are to be trusted when they produce good results--a wholly unsatisfying conclusion that gives us no guidance going forward."
1,Suprisingly bad.,"Amazed at how highly (star) rated this book is, I felt I had to bring it down a notch......The book has been well appraised by most of the negative reviewers already so I'll just reiterate:1) Utterly confused, tenuous and contradictory hypothesis.2) Reminds me of English Lit. essays I'd write at high school, where I had no real point, but had to fill 1000 words.2) Tipping Point was a great book. What a shame this wasn't."
3,First few chapters are great,"Malcolm Gladwell, the introduction is great and it sets a huge expectation on snap judgement - an unknown territory atleast to me! Initial chapters talks about how thin slicing works and why it always yield results. But in the later chapters, Gladwell starts talking about how the snap judgment could be wrong and I felt the both the stories are not well connected and conclusion left me confused."
3,"Interesting Idea, Poor Execution","I will keep my review brief as others have covered my critiques fairly well. Malcolm Gladwell presents a series of interesting topics, but there isn't a strong theme tying them together. Inconsistencies of interpretation between the stories is one of the most frustrating aspects of this book. Gladwell will make a claim to support his conclusions on one topic, but assume its contradiction in support of his claim in another topic.The most frustrating aspect of this book is its lack of a thesis, though. Gladwell sets out a thesis consisting of three points in his introduction, but you would never come up with those theses simply by reading the book; I was left unconvinced he tried to make a case for them even though I actively looked for supporting evidence while reading."
2,Blink = Common sense,"I read this book because I heard it was such a good book but I was very disappointed. I have to accept this book is a compilation of good articles and everyday examples but a lot of what he explains is common sense.Blink is about trusting the instant impressions you get in the blink of an eye, but this is not necessarily true all the times. For example, how many of us have dislike someone we meet but after a while we become excellent friends?I think he is right in some things but his theory warns you against ovethinking, and that not always works.Like I said some of Gladwell's points are ambiguous. I also think this book lacks a satisfying conclusion.But I recommend it anyway, just so you get your own opinion about it. But if you can, just get it from the library, don't buy it please."
1,I wish I could give it 0 stars,"This is a horrible book written to the idiot in everyone, so, naturally it sells like hot cakes. If you think this man is better at reasoning and theory than Socrates then go ahead and lemer off of a cliff, if you realize that Socratic methods will be more benificial for our society, then support Socratic bassed works rather than this bunk.God save humanity...."
3,Interesting read that loses steam along the way,"This book started with a bang and got me hooked. It is a very interesting premise and the accounts that Gladwell started with were relevant and powerful in illustrating his thesis. Halfway through the book, the different stories Gladwell included become less and less pertinent to his central thesis. The point becomes really diffuse in the second half of the book and he almost lost my interest. One of the stars in my rating is from the fact that it is a decent effort and an interesting premise, but could be executed better to maintain readers' interest."
3,focus not,i thought this book would provide with some insight to my own inner voice but it is a collection of different stories some of which can actually confuse you when you try to relate to the main point of the book. are we suppose to follow our first insight or not? it does not really teach you anything but offers series of interesting stories...
3,Interesting anecdotes in search of a theme,"Mr. Gladwell's subject is important, and he explores a number of thought provoking issues. However, like so many pop ""science lite"" tomes, Blink works awfully hard (and without much success) to provide a unifying theme for a scattershot collection of admittedly interesting examples. His bottomline observation: humans often make snap judgements; sometimes, that's good. Sometimes, that's bad. Got it. I'll make a snap judgment and say that Malcolm's bank account is in pretty good shape."
3,Round about way to make a point,"I enjoyed the first few chapters immensely, as well as the conclusion. The author uses descriptive stories to make his case, and honestly I was not sure why he was telling some of the stories. Until the end of the book. I would suggest hanging in until the end if you make this purchase. Just commit to read the whole book or do not waste your money to buy it. Mr Gladwell has some cool ideas in this book, it just takes some time to pull them together with a unified theme."
4,Intriguing Insight into our hidden Operations Center,"This book follows many others describing the hidden realities of how we tick. But there's good self-discovery offered in the insight of ""the-how"" our mental functions actually appear to operate.It is evident that we are almost all naturally outfitted to be many times more mentally powerful and efficient in our existences, yet almost none of us recognizes this capacity. Forget the self help, self actuation, self motivation books and lecturers - use this book and others like it to truly begin to understand how we really work. So many things will begin to make sense from direct experience - instinct, seeming extra sensory recognitions, gut awareness, hunches - all that sensory input that each of us absorbs day to day gets analyzed, strained and assigned a level of recognition, long before we are consciously aware of why we do or think what we do.This book is an excellent addendum to the Human Animal Operating Manual."
3,A good read,I would be very careful about reading psyche books where the author is not a christian. (I know find one that is right?) However there are some fascinating discoverys in this book. Although apart from God they are vain.
4,Great book even if I don't agree with it...,"The book is based on an interesting premise and the writing style is very easy to read, it really sucks you in. I personally REALLY like Malcolm Gladwell's books/lectures/ideas -- he's defeinitely one of my favorites.Note that after reading this book I'm not convinced that I completely agree with the fundamental arguement it's trying to make. I also didn't like it as much as Gladwell's previous book, Tipping Point. But, I don't want to sound overly critical. What I consider high quality writing isn't based upon whether or not I agree with the arguement the author is trying to make. The ideas are unique and creative and that alone is basis enough for me to give this book four stars. One last note is that you might want to look at the rebuttal to this book titled Think! (I have not read it but if you find Blink interesting you would probably also like Think!)."
2,Takes avoiding paralysis of analysis to the absurd,"I guess the thinner the slice the better the decision, so I should make decisions on no information and select leaders with the least experience. Should have talked more about knowing when enough info is sufficient and how to identify the risks involved with making decisions rather than pushing the line that less really is more. His sources are a bit suspect to anyone that knows them, but, with enogh salt, this book gives some points to ponder."
3,interesting,"It was college level reading, too much research information thru out the book. Overall, I enjoyed it and learn something from it."
2,"Interesting, but lacking a point","Throughout the book, the author offers numerous examples of how people make snap judgments, and how some of these are harmful while others are more accurate than decisions made after over-analysis. Unfortunately, though, the author doesn't say much about how to distinguish the two. I think we all know that people make snap decisions and that some work out and some don't. Gladwell tells us little more than that. For a book like this, it would've been much more helpful if Gladwell could offer insights as to how and when people should use snap judgments rather than just offering examples of them."
3,Interesting but lacking punch,"Gladwell's other books 'The Tipping Point' and 'Outliers' both were great to read and had some really interesting, important insights. 'Blink' is likewise, a great read but not with quite the same validity in the insights. Cognitive science is a deep and little understood domain so it is perhaps a little beyond a journalist such as Gladwell to be making any groundbreaking claims.But what he does do well, without fail, is provide interesting examples and find insights that a mere mortal would never even consider. He is at the very least, thought-provoking, and what more could you ask of a book than to make you really THINK about things?"
3,Almost...,"First, let me say that this is a good book. It's well worth your time to read. I don't think that it's as good as the Tipping Point though. This one seems to go a little longer than what is necessary maybe. It seems to be like Mr. Gladwell is trying to stretch it out a bit. The good thing about all of it though, is that it is a very quick read, and you won't have a lot of time invested into it. So definitely pick this one up, you won't regret it!"
3,"agree with the reviewer who said this book was ""mediocre""","Like the reviewer who posted just before me, I also thought the book could have made an excellent article. You can certainly skip around in this book and get the point of it. I forced myself to read the whole book even though I lost interest maybe halfway or 2/3 of the way through because the author seemed to be just supporting his main idea with more and more examples. I thought I should force myself to read the whole book in case I missed some amazing new insights, but there was nothing new in it. I enjoyed the examples though, which is why I give this book 3 stars. All in all it was truly mediocre at best."
4,Good collection of stories,"For me, this book was a good collection of stories, that hold some useful idea in them. And that is really exciting. But, unfortunately, as it was said above, Gladwell fails to bring the general idea (at least until the few paragraphs at the end of the book) and usually whiffle between those short stories. What's good - he gives you some ideas of what you might want to explore more seriously later."
3,interesting,"The book was interesting and I enjoy learning about common things on a deeper level. But I thought the book was a little contradictary. In some stories he talked about those first 2 seconds, the results of ""thin slicing"", and the appropriate response from it and other times the inappropriate response occurred. It had me a little confused. After reading the book (well really I listened to it on CD) I had to go and read what the book was about again. Then I realized more that it's about the ""thin slicing"" the right information in those first few seconds. Interesting information but I thought by the end of the book I would have learned how better to think without thinking and I don't think I did. I WOULD be interested in doing some of the facial expression recognition training videos he talked about though!"
2,"Read the First Chapter, and even take that with a grain of salt","If you read the first chapter of this book, you'll get the point he's trying to make. It's an interesting point, but it should be summed up in a 10 page article, not a 200 page book.(I've also read that the results of the studies he cites in his first chapter are exaggerated)"
5,Great Book,"When this book came out in hard cover, I wanted to read it, but decided to wait for the paperback version. I don't know many people who haven't read it by now. I am finaly getting to it and it is a terrific book!"
