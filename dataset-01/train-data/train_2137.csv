2,disappointed in editorial reviews,I found the editorial reviews on this book disappointing. Ikept wondering if they had read the same book I had just finished. Thecharacter the author developed was Emilio. The other characters were just not realistic or very interesting. I found some of the sentence structure difficult. I had to read quite a few sentences over to try to fiqure out what the author was saying. I enjoy innovative writing but this style did not add anything to the story except slowing the reader. The story was slow enough. END
5,Excellent bag for camping.,Great bag for your belt when camping.Holds a surprising amount of stuff and doesn't seem in the way.
3,It'll do,"The pouch is well made but, I think the front would have been better with two buttons. I went well during the first washing, that should tell you something."
5,"Great, Sturdy Little Carry-All.","I bought several of these, in different colors, to keep small items organized around my small apartment, or to take on trips. They are made of very sturdy canvas, and I'm sure will prove very durable. Recommended."
3,Nice pouch,This pouch is very well constructed. The belt loop is sewed into place so there is no possibility of having it fall off of your belt. The belt loop should have been placed a bit higher. It is a bit uncomfortable when getting in and out of the car with it on.
5,great bed!,"extremely happy with the of this bed! Have haId back problems with other beds, this bed was extraordinarily comfortable. Instead of moving around all night trying to get comfortable, I could sleep in the same position all nite and wake up happy"
2,Don't Be Cheap Like I was!! You'll regret...!,"I just want to make sure future buyers are aware of the consequences from saving a buck when you see deals like this. With all honest, I should have put two and two together before jumping the gun and purchasing this so-called ""good deal."" Please, don't make the same mistake like I did. There is a reason why a bed like this is on the cheap side. Its hot and retains all the heat your body produces at night and makes you sweat like a pig! Its so-called ""memory foam,"" is not fit to comfort. It makes you sink into the foam without any support for your back at night. I would rather much have any old fashion mattress than this memory foam mattress. I should have spent my money on something that cost more, but would be well worth every penny I worked hard to earn. Not some thing like this I regret every night buying! I would not recommend this purchase to future mattress seekers."
5,Great Deal!,I am so pleased with this mattress. This is my first memory foam mattress and it is excellent. It shipped quickly (within a few days) and shipping was free. I am truly happy I decided to order this online!
1,Fasle advertising,"This sounds like a good saw and i would have liked to try one BUT!! After trying to order one,they were listed as (back ordered)not true i called Delta they haven't even started making them yet, not due to come out till june or july i was told. So how can thet be forsale i asked?????? there not the rep. said..... Thank you,Re-thinking my shopping options"
5,Good Saw,"I originally didn't plan to spend this much on a miter saw, but I'm glad I did.There are several 12 inch compound saws, but I chose this model for the twin lasers and the crown clips. They both work well, and were worth the price.Quick set up. Good directions. No adjustments needed."
5,"Another bride, another groom........YUMMY",This picture is a scream! A big one!Eddie Cantor acts more like Woody Allen in this movie as a person whos affected by and is allergic to everything! And he loves his cow more than his flerting nurse!And he expects to die soon so he go's to the pcturesque south/west for the scenery. (setting for the funeral-with fruit!)But....trouble starts when he findes out that he helped a girl escape from an unwanted marrage. She really loves indian boy from a tribe up in the mountians. Of corse (1930s view) this cannot be done.I wont say much but the movie is a spinning technicolor/comedy mess of fun and frolic. (and Busby B. too!)
4,"Very entertaining, memorable.",I read this book some years ago and enjoyed it. I lost my copy and have been looking for another one ever since.
3,This is my kind of book!,What better way to set up your kid's eating disorders than a nice cookie monster book for toddlers? So settle down with some cookies and read this book with a loved one.
4,"Good choice, better then the cheaper units","Solid bike. Took about 1 hours to assemble, not hard at all and the nuts and bolts were shrink wrapped to cardboard along with their description making it easy to find the parts that were needed next, a nice touch. Good quality parts at least the visible ones. The power cord could be longer that is about my only complaint but its not a big deal. Much better quality then the cheaper ones sold in most general purpose sporting goods stores."
1,"outdated, redundant, uninteresting, unnecessary","sub-Wax Trax, maybe sub-Cleopatra industrial dance junk that doesn't earn it's 'tude. They probably think they sound like Ministry. I think they left their beat box on its default settings. KMFDM if you must, Sister Machine Gun if you can't help yourself, but do cross the street to avoid this album.If you want an ""Adrenaline shot"" of ""industrial"" ""hate"", consider a Grey Wolves album, or (for people who need their irony explicit) maybe an early Foetus. Cubanate are playing for an audience of dummies.Dyslexics beware: I purchased this accidentally cos I thought the band name was antimatter. God I'm stupid."
5,Magical - a lifetime favorite!,"This book takes me back to my own childhood visits to my grandparent's 100 year-old tin-roofed farmhouse along a train route in rural Pennsylvania. Now my 4 year-old son enjoys real-life ""Hiawatha Passing"" everytime we go to visit his great-grandparents and he gets to sleep in the upstairs bedroom facing the tracks. My son has memorized every word of this book including the postscript. The book is and will always be a family favorite. The story is captivatingly told and the illustrations are beautiful."
3,Unhappy with mini tortilla baker,I found this product not to be what I was looking for. I tried using corn tortillas and they broke apart. Have not tried with the flour tortillas. I've always like my taco salad in a corn tortilla.
4,"Love it, but they are not dishwasher safe.","These do exactly what they promise. They handle ""large"" tortillas perfectly. I will be trying them with ""extra large"" tortilla soon, but they look like they will handle it fine.I would love to have given this five stars, but they are not dishwasher safe (the box is not marked dishwasher safe, so I took a chance). They rusted slightly around the lip."
5,Work Perfectly,"I actually use these all the time. They make great tortilla shells that can be filled with almost anything but soup. I have another odd use for them. I feed my dogs and cats with the bowls. They eat the contents and then help themselves to the ""juice soaked"" bowl. If I had the time and money I would try to patent something like that for pet use. Please don't leave a note that corn or flour tortillas are bad for my pets. Have you seen the ingredients in pet food?"
3,Better off going to the store,"After buying 2 of these, I found a pack of 4 sold at Bed, Bath, and Beyond for a few dollars cheaper. Better off just going to a store for these."
2,Too Small!!!,"I was so excited to order these tortilla bowls. Problem is they came from China and it took almost one month to arrive. I never would have ordered them had I known that's where the seller was. They finally arrived and I was very very disappointed. They were way smaller than I had anticipated. I didn't order the ""mini"" bowls.I did use them and they worked perfectly but they were so small that I ended up making two taco salads for dinner. Even then, you couldn't fill the tortilla up too much as it was so small. I was expecting a much larger tortilla bowl!!!Very disappointed."
1,Expected much more,"The idea of racing mico machines in a table, lab, garden or your desk is very cool. It too bad the game did not take advantage of it. Instead, you have a very dull game, with a very annoying multiplayer mode, where you can race for more tah 10 seconds without the race beeing stoped becase the other player dissapeared from the screen and... uh, never mind, just don buy the game."
3,Not as nice as the Avalon Coach,I bought two of the Avalon Trainer series and two of the Avalon Coach series. This watch does not function as well as the Coach series watches. It's way too easy to double beep the start/stop button. The Coach doesn't seem to have this problem. I think the Coaches cost a couple bucks more.
4,Perfect set for the Pokemon Lover in your family,"Even if they have some of these figures already (in normal, non-metalic form) they will LOVE this set that has all their favorites in a shiny new color. They are the larger size pokemons too, which makes this a fantastic value at the price I bought it for. [...]"
1,Lemon?,"This compressor is LOUD. It also had an air leak at the weld on the tanks, which leads to beleive that it was shoddy manufacturing. I sent it right back and purchaced the Hatachi EC119SA. This compressor is quieter and feels and sounds solid. It is a little heavier,but compared to the alternative I would gladly choose the Hitachi hands down. I am in construction and so far it is working fantastic."
5,Best book I have ever read!,"This book was wonderful. I picked it up at my library and I finished it within four days! I could not put it down. I am the type of person who hates to read but this is definetly a five-star book. I recommend this book to any gymnast. This book makes you want to go to the gym. It gave me a great example that teaches me that hard work pays off. Mary Lou is the best gymnast in the world you may not believe it now but after you read this book you will! One word to describe this book, EXCELLENT!"
3,Steve Bug - Released Tracks,"Nice straight-up techno from Steve Bug. _Released Tracks_ gathers together tracks off of various 12""s and repackages them in one convenient place. ""1303"" trills as bleeps on the floor, while ""Magig is Magic"" spins around a small sample as the pounding sets things in motion. The tracks don't quite develop enough to make them classic, but for what they set out to do, they're plenty good. ""Fresh,"" for instance, dishes up some fine melodic grooves and the thick layers (and rave whistle) of ""Sensitive"" gets the feet tapping. Russ Gabriel brings his own thumping and wobbling sensibility to ""Honeymoon,"" while ""H0"" sounds like a telegraph boogie beamed in from the future. Nifty."
1,DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE VERSION,"I never would have purchased the Kindle version of this book - for $24 - had I known it would be missing ALL the diagrams and figures the printed copies contain. I am using it as a textbook as part of my BS in Adult Education, and first week in they are asking for feedback on the charts and diagrams. Lucky me, money down the drain, and I will be unable to complete this week's assignment. This has to be the most disappointing edition of any Kindle book I have ever purchased.Allow me to reiterate: DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE VERSION IF YOU WANT THE CHARTS AND DIAGRAMS!!!"
4,Adequate adult learning textbook,This is an adequate book for adult learning. It does have nice depictions of models and theories and supports its prose with a good amount of literature.
5,"Selfless is a great, underrated album","One of my favorite albums to listen to. Godflesh is one of the great underrated warriors of hardcore music. The heavy thumping of Green's bass and Broadrick's genius makes for a legendary record. Songs like Xnoybis, Bigot, Black Boned Angel all rounding to Go Bread Your Wings makes this a journey. If you listen closely, you can hear the longing for Jesu. Good to hear GF is back and writing new stuff. Can't wait!"
1,Noise,Winner of one of the worst CD's in my collection! I can't believe someone could give this 5 stars?
5,Just what I needed!,"This book is great for beginners - may be great for everyone, I can only speak for myself as a beginner. I've used it almost daily for about 8 months. I bought other books at the same time, after the first week, they have not been touched. It has great advice and great variety. I did a whole lot more than 10 minutes, but with this book, diet and a treadmill, I have been quite successful building a new routine and a new body! This book was just what I needed and I am really, really glad I bought it."
5,Reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut,"If someone were watching while a chapter was read, they'd have caught me with a smile as I thought ""This is good. How can this be so clear, that the connection had not occurred to me before?"".This is a thought provoking, entertaining book that discusses many commonly accepted views we just take as 'true'.Walter Block has no ""axe to grind"" and entertains the reader with logic and pleasant reasoning. Most enjoyable. A great book to open and discover that this is an author with a brilliant mind.The author's goal may be to provide the opportunity to have fun while thinking and reasoning through cultural views that are rarely discussed. Walter's style and humor are reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut."
1,Fraudulent reasoning,"Typical libertarian pap. Block consistently leaves out half of the argument. Already in the introduction we have: ""Taxation ... involves aggression against nonaggressive citizens who refuse to pay. ... The individual is not free to reject the offer."" Sure he is, Walter. He can leave the country if he doesn't like the obligations of citizenship.This kind of slapdash, phony reasoning runs through the whole book. I can recommend it only to those who really need to know what a fraudulant theory libertarianism is."
5,So lucid it can't be true!,"I was expecting a standard Rothbardian treatment of vices and I was shocked at this short, easily read book. I bought it in San Francisco, CA, and was finished with it by the time I stepped onto Illinoisian soil. The arguments are straight Mises - amazingly simple, yet profound. It's hard to explain how such simplicity can be found in each chapter. If you are unconvinced, just read any chapter (many are only two pages long) - concerning the miser, the corrupt cop, the pimp, and the advertiser. This isn't Rothbardian in that Murray Rothbard will argue down to the very philosophic principles to prove his point. As an analogy, you don't need to know the quantum mechanics [Rothbard] of the transistors (semiconductors) to know the functions [Block] of your computer. Sorta."
4,Rebel Powers - 'Not One Star Will Stand The Night' (Strange Attractors),"Yet, another side project for Acid Mothers Temple main player - Kawabata Makoto. Until I recently purchased this CD from Ebay, I never even heard of the title. Check out the line-up as it includes two other AMT members - Makoto - guitar & sarangui, Cotton Casino - vocals, Koizumi Hajime - percussion with David Keenan on second guitar. Just two lengthy tracks - ""We Are For The Dark"" (25:00) with it's space out weirdness and a bit of psychedelic noise and the more so (if that's possible) experimental ""Our God Is A Mighty Fortress"" (23:58). Overall, not a bad choice but I still say this disc is pretty much aimed toward the completists and die-hard fans."
2,Not worth it! 3 out of 3 kids didn't like it!,"My mom bought two of these, one for my child and another to have at her house for all the grandkids. We are all really big Wiggle fans so thought this would be a big hit with the kids.We opened up mine for my 3years, 4,5 year old cousins. None of them could get into it. Grandmom decided to return hers to the store before opening it up.I gave this a few times to my daughter to play with and really showed no interest in it. The last occasion that I gave it to her she looked at it and said ""this is stupid"". So that was the last of that!But we are so glad to see other Wiggles merchandise on its way and for now will keep on Wiggling!"
1,BORING GRINDCORE BAND,As many have stated once you are one Bolt Thrower CD you own them all. The guitars sound the same each album with a lot of repetition. This bands [is bad].
1,Tiny teapot,"This teapot is pretty, but you can't boil water in it, seems useless. Also, the description neglected to state its size, it will only hold about 12 ounces of water. The picture is misleading. I will be returning it."
3,Doesn't come close to home made,I tried this on a recommendation from a relative. I'll stick to home made as I know what's in it and it's far superior to this stuff. These were in the ballpark with Mcdonalds. It's convenient but I'll take quality over convenience and home made pancakes are very easy to make.
2,pancake mix,I wouldn't buy this again. The bottle is hard to work with and the pancakes are just not that good. I prefer the original pancake mix and not this one.
5,Great.,Shiped fast. product works great. I have had no issues with it and I enjoy reloading for my .45 if your looking buy this one.
3,ok,"A little less sturdy than I imagined but does the job. The rack is pretty small, so I can't fit an entire load of laundry on it. But other than that, very compact and works fine."
4,"good product, great price, and even better service","this clothes drying rack was everything i expected it to be. its sturdy, compact and easy to store. its rather small (check out the dimensions), but works perfect for a household of two. if you plan to hang dry most of your clothes, i would recommend looking for a larger drying rack... theyre out there."
4,"Well-made, compact drying rack","This is the third Polder drying rack I own. Like the others, it's much better than other brands of drying racks I've had in the past because of it's strength and durability. It also folds down easily to store. This rack is considerably smaller than a standard drying rack, so it's better for smaller items and won't fit your average t-shirt or pair of jeans (except maybe children's clothing). While the rack is well-made, I've found it a good idea to occasionally tighten the screws on each joint on the side (takes just a minute w/ a screwdriver) because they can loosen over time from unfolding and folding the rack, especially if it's used often. I do this will all my metal Polder drying racks and they've held up extremely well for years. I'm very happy with this rack for drying my small items and definitely recommend it."
5,Stylish and light weight,"I am in love with this clothes dryer. After years of having my heart broken by difficult wooden dryers, this sleek chrome model is a steal"
3,It's ok but just ok.,"If your looking for something small, light and compact then this is the dryer for you. The metal is very light weight."
5,what can I say!,It's a clothes rack that works very well. It is sturdy and easy to set up. It is great for those personal articles of clothing that will not do well in a dryer.
4,Drying Rack,"I loved the drying rack,I bought two of them. However, I wish they were longer, I am only able to fit two small loads on both of them."
3,Dont Bother,Bought this dryer rack with a washer rack was on back order and i was told i could not cancell so i got washer first item was smaller then i thought and with shipping charges coat more then expected and could have got at a local store quicker and cheeper
1,A terrible product,"I was extremely disappointed with the Chrome Accordion dryer shipped to me. I received the product and it is completely twisted. It can't stand up on its own because all four legs won't touch the ground. This product won't even hold a single towel. Because of receiving a product like this, wouldn't buy another polder product ever."
2,Decent - But Started Rusting,I purchased this product in May 2011. It was easy to assemble and looks sturdy. Unfortunately we had some seasonal rain here in So. California and the rack started rusting after being in 2 or 3 rains. Hence I'm in market for a new rack would not buy from this manufacturer again
2,It's very small,I thought it's of good size but when I got it =. It was very small in size. It's strong enough but enough for small and few clothes only.
3,Wish I would've chosen differently...,"Make no mistake, it's definitely great quality. But no measurements were provided--so I just ""went for it"". In reality it seems alot smaller than in picture. So for the price I could have purchased two of another brand I had previously looked at that would have more than adequately served the purpose. But my mistake for not getting enough info."
3,small,This rack is decievingly small. It cannot dry a pair of men's pants without wrinkling the heck out of them. I can fit a small sized towel. It is tall but not wide enough. Very disapointed. It is however sturdy and folds nicely. But not useful for what I need.
5,Compact,Great for small spaces and small loads. I have a compact washing machine and this is perfect for us. It hides nicely on a hook on the wall by the side of the washing machine. Light and easy to open/close and store.
5,"Life, the Universe and Everything and more","This book answers the question of Life, The Universe and Everything and more. It goes in depth about many aspects of spirituality which are often misunderstood. It gives light on such topics as relationships, New Age, Love, Healing, Karma, Reincarnation, Jesus, Buddha, Death, Ego, meditation... I found the chapter entitled ""Human Values in the Classroom"" very timely for our society. It is something that every teacher, and thereby our children, would benefit from reading. I hope more people read this book and uplift the conciousness on our planet."
5,"A fresh perespective of key aspects of life - Profound, yet practical.","This is the first Sri Sri's book one should read. What I liked is that this book covers wide variety of topics from Problem in this age, Fear, Love, Relationship, Buddha, Jesus to Medidation. There is more that is covered and but, I wanted to write a quick review. The message in profound and pratical and it'll help in our day-to-day life. It's a feel-good/self-help book and it will help you bring positive thinking deep inside, not just superficial.If interested you can visit my profile (links for my website / amazon listmania) for books on authentic Vedic knowledge."
5,A staple of Indian cooking,I am new to Indian cooking. Urad Dal seemed to be a staple. I've used it in making several types of mixtures that I have fried. I will definitely order this product from this company again.
1,Very bad problems,"I had bought one in November, 2007. It worked for about 10 days, and then it got where it would take about 15 minutes to come on, and when it did the speed would very up and down. Then in a few more days it would not come on at all. So I sent it back and got my money back to wait till next year to buy a nother one. I bought the new one in December, 2008. It run for about 14 days and got to ware it would not come on at all. So sent it back. Order the jet 1014vsi, it is a lot nicer lathe and I am not having trouble with it. Buy the Jet."
2,bad workmanship,"lathe came in days before i was expecting it. amazon came through as always.shipping box looked like crap but the lathe was not damaged. the hand wheel on the spindle side is so out of round and crooked that it will have to be replaced. there is rust on the machined surfaces and the pulleys are covered. the belt has a noticeable bad place in it so that will have to be replaced also. i dont like the plastic handles and they will also be replaced with metal ones.when i started the lathe, it almost walked it's 80 lbs off the table due to the hand wheel vibration.they say you get what you pay for. i have no doubt that this will be a good lathe. it is bulky and when yo take off the errant handwheel, very smooth. i just have to fix the items that they cut cost on and everything should be ok."
5,"""Turning"" out great to be a great lathe for me!","I haven't done any turning in almost 30 years since using an old lathe of my father's. I've been wanting to get back to it recently without a big investment in money or shop space. I looked at the comments here and picked the PSI TCLPROVS Turncrafter. Amazon offered free shipping and a good price relative to the competition. It sits nicely on the bench. The variable speed is great. The included accessories, plus a set of chisels from my dad, allowed me to get right at my first turning project. So far, it is working well for what I need."
3,I got what I paid for...,"I'm new to turning and purchased this lathe because of the reviews and the cost. I think in a nutshell the lathe is OK but this one has some problems.1. it shuts down for no reason after turning it on. I thought maybe it was too hot but it's done it 10 seconds after starting it.2. Sometimes it looses power and immediately comes back while turning.3. It's noisy and has a lot of vibration with no wood in it.4. As others have commented, the fit and finish isn't the best but again for the price it's probably okay.This one will be returned for refund due the problems. I can't say I don't recommend it because if mine didn't have the problems it does it would be fine for what I wanted."
1,Poor Machine Fit,"The bolts that hold the ""headstock"" to the ""bed"" were not machined in the proper location. This condition would not allow (1) of the mounting bolts to be attached.I returned the lathe for a refund."
4,Great Lathe,I'm new to woodturning. This is my first lathe. So far it has been great. I'm thinking of drilling out the rubber leggs and mounting mine down to the bench. No other problems.
4,Nice looking towel rack,"This is the first time I have used the open ring sytle. This style works better than the ring towel rack we had before. The ring kept falling off. This ring is handsome, and is well made. I am very happy with it so far."
2,The concept & design appealing. Durability lacking,"I purchased this product because the concept & design are appealing, attractive, and fits my decor. However, I have had enough trouble keeping the parts together and in working order that I purchased this second one as a source of spare parts."
2,Profoundly unhelpful,"In the course of working through secondary literature for my doctoral dissertation (on Heidegger), I read Schalow's book --- and was amazed by how badly written it was. His articles are better (well, some of them), but this book seems to consist entirely of badly-worded summaries of seemingly random Heidegger lectures, combined with even more random tangents on everyone from Freud to Tillich, and nowhere with any consistency or with anything interesting to say. In 170 pages I couldn't discern a single proposition; his stated thesis is some sort of vague feeling that ""Schelling was very influential on Heidegger!"", but the only support for this claim is a series of haphazard quotations pulled from Heidegger's 1936 Schelling lectures (as if this was the only time he ever wrote on Schelling). The sentences are so poorly constructed that I wonder how any editor ever let this go to press."
3,Good novel in search of an editor.,"Advertised as a historical fiction, I read this book to ready myself for my Bermuda vacation. The story is good - filled with romance, beautiful clothes, pirates, sailing and mystery. However, on every page, I had the urge to take out my red pen and mark the errors. Misuse of ""then"" and ""than"" is throughout. Near the end it's impossible to determine which character is speaking. Shame on the publisher for not editing this otherwise enjoyable book."
5,name your price!,"I like this product, but I do wish that the price was much cheaper. The are other methods used now and this can go either way."
4,durarara,i love the dvd and i didn't have to wait long for the shipment. sadly i have to say it's a bit pricey. that much for only 9 eps? idk even though i love it i won't be doing that again
3,Awesome anime but,"This would have been better if they released it in Bluray .Durarara is a well written and animated title.But this anime was made in HD , so why is the US production company not releasing a Bluray version.I love the dubb on this anime, the voice actors are awesome, my buddies are in it.But I have stop collecting DVD.So please release it in Bluray."
3,"Great idea, but ....","This device would do a great job of scoring chestnuts if it were better machined. The cutting blades are inset into a plastic screw fixture. Problem is that the plastic screw does not fit tightly, so every time it cuts into a chestnut, you have to remove the blade assembly from the chestnut and screw it back into the device.I'm hopeful that the manufacturer will fix this in the future, because it is a great idea."
1,Dissappointed,"My blades bent after about 25 chestnuts. Since the blades go into the chestnut in an arc motion, the blades have sideways pressure on them. There has to be a better option."
5,A must for anyone with epilepsy or has a family member with it,"Epilepsy is a condition that must be managed lest it be a true problem. Now in a newly expanded and updated third edition, ""Epilepsy 199 Answers: A Doctor's Responds to his Patient's Questions"" is a reference on epilepsy comprised in the question and answer form on 199 questions. With much advice discussing how diet, surgery, therapy, and more can affect one's epilepsy, ""Epilepsy 199 Answers"" is a must for anyone with epilepsy or has a family member with it, and wants to be armed with knowledge."
5,My Last Hope for Rock and Roll,For years I have listened to the same cookie cutter Rock and Roll bands being churned out. Buckcherry is like a breath of fresh air and their debut CD is wonderful.
3,Deseves a listening to,"BUCKCHERRY is a very good debut album from the band of the same name. The music is no nonsense rock 'n' roll with an attitude to boot. Joshua Todd has a very amazing vocal range that backed by great guitars and drums reminds us of the glory days of pure rock. LIT UP, CHECK YOUR HEAD,and FOR THE MOVIES are the 3 big songs from this album that have gained some airplay, but some of the other ones rock. CRUSHED, DEAD AGAIN, LAWLESS AND LULU are songs that will have u turning the volume up loud on your stereo. BORDERLINE has a very bluesy sound to it that rocks and should also be listened to. This is a very good album and with their follow up TIMEBOMB shows, this band has alot of promise. Hopefully with the turmoil the band is going through right now, they can regroup and bring us some more music. I would actually rate this as more 3 1/2 stars than just 3."
2,In one ear...,"I hear these guys are really good live, but so often this quality doesn't transfer so well to the studio. I bought this mainly for Lit Up but found the rest of it kind of generic. Much like their L.A. Rock ancestors (wow, am I old) Guns 'N F'n Roses and Motley Crue, they have the attitude and all that stuff, but unlike those bands they don't have the songs to back them up. Maybe on their next album they can add some techno and rap to the mix and at least sell some albums. :-P"
5,Great Hard Rock!,"This cd kicks a**! It nice to finally see a good hard rock cd instead of most of the c**p put out today. Buckcherry brings us hope of another GN'R, AC/DC-type band at a time when they don't make rock like they used to."
5,A Good Time!,"I heard this band play live the other night. I was really surprised to discover how much I liked them. There are some catchy songs -- if you can believe that.This group, while on stage, just takes you into their little world -- where you just can't take your eyes and ears off of them."
4,"a reveiew of "" Buckcherry ""","In todays music world everything is run by a corperation . Whether its the latest pop group , or a no-talented so called "" rocker "" like Korn or Kid Rock , who can't even play in tune and are probubly run by corprete executives anyway . Exept for Buckcherry . There blues based music Rocks. Keith Nelsons a great guitarist and Joshua Todds voice ( althogh its stupid to compare ) sounds like Iggy Pop gone wild . There debt ablum is probubly the best ablum of 1999 . All the songs are awesome . It is not a listen to one track then forget about the other elleven songs either . The best songs wern't even relished as singles. If you like old school hard rock , like Guns n Roses , the BlackCrows , ACDC , or are just looking for a breath of fresh air in this musical world of Pop and bands that can't play this ablum is for you . Its a big middle finger aimed at the people who tried to destroy Rock n Roll ."
4,Great music but to use drugs in music.,"I first saw Buckcherry on VH1 Rock Show and they rocked!!!! They have a great sound of Classic bluesy hard rock, and they are great. Although the usa many refrences to drugs in the music and that is not good for young people who look up to Bucckcherry. ROCK ON"
4,Good stuff,"An excellent first effort. Finally a band from LA that puts the city back on the musical map. Tinges of 80s hair bands, 70s Aerosmith, with a little Sex Pistols (Steve Jones did co-produce)thrown in for good measure. Lit Up and Check Your Head kicks with plenty of drive and vigor. One of the few new bands that I can actually look forward to future releases from."
4,I like it! I really like it!,"I first picked up this CD a while ago, and I listened to it and was impressed... THEN... I lost it! I went out n bought another because I could not live without it! You have to hear this man's voice. It's got this great edge to it. I have to agree that they sound like a mix of GNR and Black Crowes... a PERFECT combo! If you've heard Buckcherry's music on the radio... but this CD you will NOT be disappointed..."
2,"BUCKCHERRY; Good live act, but this album...","I saw these guys open up for Lenny Kravitz at Saratoga, NY, like 5 years ago. I thought that Buckcherry did pretty good, so I got their debut self-titled album. I hate to say this, but this is the type of album with only one good song(Lit Up) on it and the rest is just filler. Nonetheless, I think it's a great band to catch live."
5,Rock n roll,This CD ROCKS! Real rock is now alive and it's because of this band. This CD has everything that defines rock and roll. A must have for any lover of rock. Joshua Todd is so sexy.
3,when bands break up after two albums,"Yes, this album is fluff, the band is fluff. Obviously so, seeing as how the band stayed together for a mere two lps. I think the other band of recent memory to do that was Savage Garden....yeesh.That aside, the album rocks. That first single Lit Up is golden and it still turns my crank. For the Movies, Check Your Head, Lawless and Lulu...good stuff.Nothing to last the tests of time, but that never interested me in the first place with these guys. Rock on Josh!"
3,A litte too familiar,I liked them the first time I heard them. When they were called The Black Crowes. Now whether that is a bad thing is up to you.
2,"Immature Rock, Simple Lyrics","I like the whole idea of bringing back the attitude of the '80's L.A. hard-rock scene (early Motley Crue, Junkyard, Guns N Roses), but the attitude is not enough. There has got to be some good music, which, unfortunately, you'll have a hard time finding on this CD. All posh no substance."
1,Horrible Drone!,"Hey fans! It's us-Buckcherry. We made this Cd and we hate it-but buy it anyway, ok? Thanks. Love, BUCKCHERRY!"
1,Their new single SUCKS,"It's annoying and unoriginal. ""For The Movies"" is the worst song of 1999. It beats ""Summer Girls."""
1,BUCKCHERRY ARE SHITE!,"OK I admit that I havn't heared much of their songs, BUT they did support Kiss in Wembley '99. All the reviews that I read show said how Buckcherry are so good, and how they're like Guns'n'roses. I was expecting them to put on a good show, but they were very crap and their sound mix was absolute shite! I mean nobody could make out what he was saying! Kiss on the other hand were amazing!!!"
4,A solid Rock and Roll CD.,"This is a cool CD. Its good to see that A rock and Roll Band can gain popularity and radio play these days. I cant believe MTV edidted ""lit Up"" the way they did. Why even bother playing it. This is a total rock CD and there is no hint of aternative in it. Im not putting down any music thats out today because Im a big fan of both. I was suprised to hear some people bringing up KISS in there reviews of this album. As far as ""lit Up"" being a complete rip off of ""Shock Me"" I laugh. The Guitar riffs are slightly similar but thats where it ends. Im a huge KISS fan and these guys may have been influenced by them im sure but I dont see them as being ""Rip off artists"". You want to see rip off artists then litsen to Oasis/Beatles. They remind me of the Black Crows but louder and faster. I hope these guys do well and I look forward to seeing them when the come to our area."
5,"BUCKCHERRY, just what Rock n Roll was waitin' for","The frontman, Joshua, hes like a cross between Mick Jagger, Zach de la Rocha, Steven Tyler, Tommy Lee and Chris Robinson. And the band is like a mix of AC/DC, black crowes, kiss, g'n'r, aerosmith and any other one u found resemblance with. If youre use to classic and new rock and roll, then ur gonna love this one. Hey, dont forget, u have to hear it LOUD!"
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I didn't think this CD was going to be this good when I bought it. I saw the video for ""FOR THE MOVIES"" and I thought this might be a good CD to buy but I just bought it to day and it ROX. I love this CD!!!!!!!!!"
4,a mix of 80's and 90's rock and roll,"This cd, although not good for children to listen to, is something most modern pop and heavy metal fans will enjoy. You can understand the words and the instrument side is very good."
4,A great debut.,"Buckcherry prove they can hold their in the era of Britney Spears and N' Sync. ""Lit Up"" is the song that really kicks off the album and every song is a great single all on it's own. Buckcherry has a great future ahead of themself."
4,PRETTY COOL,"THIS CD IS PRETTY COOL. ""ALL LIT UP"" JUST F@!KIN' ROCKS! MAN THAT SONG JUST GETS ME GOIN'!"
4,"It's ""BuckCherry"", not ""Chuck Berry"".","This debut is just excellent, straight forward, hard rock! When the chorus of the first song is ""I love the cocaine"", you know how these guys are gonna rock. I got pretty tired of all the cookie-cutter bands of the late 90's, but these guys just laid it down, and have a great sound. Though most of the disc rocks hard, they toss in ""For the Movies"" and ""Borderline"" to show us that they're not just a one-trick pony. Any fans of ""The Cult"", ""Black Crowes"", ""Stooges"", and yes, ""Guns n' Roses"", should dig this. Cool cover art too."
3,Just ok,"Decent album but the follow up, 15, was much better. I was familiar with a few tracks when I bought the album and unfortunately for Buckcherry, none of the stuff I didn't know really grew on me."
5,Must have CD,This CD deserves the five stars I gave it. There is a raw energy here that is rare. The first time I listened to the entire disk I was blown away.
4,Buckcherry,"Excellent songs on this album. I'm from the Woodstock generation and this is one of the few contemporary rock bands I would consider to be hard rock. Great energy, good guitars and the vocalist is perfect for this music. I can't understand the lyrics; that's probably a good thing."
5,Very hot,"I'm a little slow on the uptake here. Didn't come across this record when it came out. Still I feel obligated to rave about it. This is very good up tempo , blues inflected hard rock. No compromises on this record. Just straight up , in your face aggressive rock. Wish I had come across this one sooner."
3,The worst origami instruction book I have purchased...,"This is not, in my opinion, a user-friendly origami book. I have MANY origami books that I have collected over the past 15+ years. I think this is truly the worst regarding instruction. She uses multicolored papers, which are colored on both sides. This is very confusing. Perhaps I am just an idiot, but 50% of the instructions I could not follow even with much cogitation. I tried to be patient with this book, but I am at my wits' end. I loathe it and wish I could return it. The saving grace, which grants this book at least 3 stars, is the information she supplies and her descriptions of various basic folds. There, she does an excellent job of explaining the very minimal origami knowledge. But I already knew all of that... it is frustrating that as an experienced origamist (is that a word? well, now it is.) I cannot make anything of her directions. The end."
1,Keep Looking,I AM a beginner at origami and I do need to learn the basics and this book is useless. There is no way to do the fold I am currently not learning unless something is wrong with the instructions. I have tried literally every angle and they just aren't right.
4,Works well on Satin Finish,I have a Martin D-1 and this product works fine on it. It is not oily and soaks in more or less to some degree. My guitar isn't very old so it is possible it would be helpful in cleaning an order guitar. I bought this because I was trying to use exactly what Martin recommended in their owners manual.
1,It is unclear what this product contains,"This is a very good cleaner for 'satin finish' acoustic guitars. However, I would NOT use it on a quality electric guitar as it appears to have silicone in it which can not only ruin the finish but make it impossible to refinish."
4,Great read,A very pleasant and fun read. I enjoyed the twists and surprises. I had read GK Chesterton's theological work and found this side of him a pleasure.
4,enjoyable,"I kind of like this series, it's not a thrilling series, but hey, sometimes you just want to relax and do a little light reading. Nothing to keep you awake at night, or sleep with the lights on, just a charming old mystery- a bedtime story."
4,review,"Other than Chesterton's 19th century European anti semitism, Farther Brown provides interesting solutions to mysteries.Fot some stupid reason this review has a minumum word count requirement. This should do it."
3,A Witty Narrator & A Bland Protagonist,"Take Sherlock Holmes, lower his intelligence by half (leaving him as still smarter than average) and turn him into a bland (but observant) Roman Catholic priest who happens to solve a lot of mysteries and you get Father Brown. Some of the mysteries he solves are complex, and the third person narration is occasionally witty (even sarcastic). However, the mild-mannered Father Brown is, frankly, a bit boring. I would much rather read about the arrogant Sherlock Holmes or Dupin any day. The author's frequent pot-shots at Protestants/Protestantism are annoying too...some are witty but mostly they just come off as mean-spirited."
4,father brown,"written in florid english with descriptive passages that is amazing the authors use of the english language. nice plots , and short stories good for crime readers."
3,the Innocence of Father Brown,"These stories are worth reading as ""classic"" detective fiction, however the concept of a super intelligent sleuth who solves the mystery solely on the basis of his superior intellect (no matter how unassuming the package) seems very dated now."
4,Nice but too small,"The reproduction of the 4 seasons of Mucha is very nice, too bad the size I order doesnt really allow you to appreciate the beauty of it unless you really get close to it"
3,Not as helpful as I had hoped,"I guess I'd say this book is not quite basic enough for my needs right now as a student doing my first practicum. I'll probably go back to it later, but right now what I need is ""practicum for dummies""! Also, it has limited examples and suggested ideas for each disorder. I recommendSurvival Guide for the Beginning Speech-Language ClinicianandClinical Methods And Practicum In Speech-Language Pathology (Singular Textbook Series). I've found these two to have good basics."
2,Ordered 3 weeks ago,I have not received the book so I will be able to tell you if it is a good until it arrives and who knows when
5,Great book!,"David does a very good job of explaining the concepts of IP multicasting and how to use it. He writes in a manner that is easy for the network novice, as well as the experienced network professional to understand. I highly recommend this book."
2,An Instructors View,I have taught from this book for one semester and like the other reviewer found many errors. This by far is not my favorite book! But its what the department decided on and gave me so I try and make the changes and explain the information that is incorrect. other than that it is not bad for a quick anatomy and phys course but dont expect to pass the medical boards using it!!! Having never taken the massage boards I do not know if this book is geared specifically to them but have a feeling it is.REW MD
1,This game is violent,"This game is extremely violent. It bills as an adventure game and pits the characters against each other in battle where the only goal is to beat up the opponent. It does not teach cooperation, but rather settling things by throwing objects at each other and fighting unfairly (lessons a child does not really need to know.)"
1,This Game is bad,"Ok, my sister rented this game. I decided to give it a whirl, and I beat it in about fifteen minutes. My sister eat it in twenty minutes. This game is bad, and simplistic. This is good for maybe a two year old. I would not reccomend if you are over the age of eight."
1,a violent disappointment,"My 4 year old daughter bought this with some of her Christmas money. It went back to the store the following day. The object of the game is to kill off the villians. You pick up furniture and other objects and throw them at the villian. When you hit him, a little puff of red (resembles blood) shows up. The meter that keeps track of the hits, fills up in red (blood red).In an already increasingly violent society, I feel this game sets the wrong example for our kids. I was extremely disappointed that my normally sweet child was yelling out ""I killed him"" and other similar phrases. Leave this game at the store."
5,Three Girls who can kick your ...,"This game is alot better than I expected it to be, I bought it for my little sister and I end up playing it just as much as she does, If you get this game, it wouldn't hurt to invest in a Memory Card because there are characters to unlock such as MOJO JOJO, FUZZY LUMPKINS AND HIM."
2,"the right idea, but mediocre execution","I love the look and feel of THE POWERPUFF GIRLS on TV, and had high hopes for this game. The 3D CG animated opening, which basically copies that of the cartoon, is really fun and enjoyable. That, with the inclusion of all the major PPG villains, made me think I was in for some fun.The game aspires to be something more than just your average fighting game, with it's use of all three girls and playpen style fighting arena. There are power-ups and props which are crucial to fighting, along with some special moves and character taunts. But with all that, plus reasonable PS1 graphics, the game is still a bit sluggish on the controls and quickly repetitive.I wish this game has faster controls, more varied gameplay, and a more involved use of the cartoon's sound fx for both the game and the interface.It could have been much cuter, I think."
1,"I liked the CGI movies in it, but...","Frankly, the gameplay itself [stunk]. Mediocre graphics, and even more mediocre gameplay. Definately not worth the money invested. I only got it because I am a Lenny Baxter clone...: )My advice is to get the Game Boy Advance Mojo A Go Go. Fantastic graphics, and looks EXACTLY like the show. Much more exciting gameplay as well.As to anyone who buys a PpG game, and doesn't expect to see violence, what planet are you from? The PpG is the most violent cartoon I have ever seen in my life, but it is supposed to be that way."
2,Okay I guess but I'm too old to learn it...,"I bought this two years ago and quickly gave it up as way too difficult to learn. I picked it up again recently and find things no different. I wanted something to do two or three tracks on, with ease and which would easily transfer to my laptop. Ha ha ha ha! While I have occasionally been able to make it function marginally, I've never yet been able to do anything meaningful with it.It apparently performs dozens and dozens of marvelous functions because I've heard very impressive samples of what others have done with it.As for all the 5 star reviews....I applaud them....they must be younger and far more tech savvy than I am. I DID find some helpful tutorials on Youtube by someone called 'gravelroad' which are far more helpful than the manual that came with it. Perhaps someday I can figure this out but for now I'm holding out little hope."
2,MICRO BR?...HOW ABOUT MICRO BS,"This thing is a classic example of hype over function. Unless you have a degree from MIT, don't even bother looking at it. The one I ordered is going back for a credit first thing tomorrow morning. And someone at BOSS should be fired for the so called ""instruction manual"" that comes with it. Matter of fact, there are about 3 pages of instruction corrections sent in the box with the unit....yes, it's so CONFUSING, even the people who made it couldn't remember to fit in all the little details. This thing is for gadget geeks, not artist. I dont know what I'm gonna order next to lay down ideas on, but it's gonna be a simple, plug in, push record, have at it, recorder, not this ""shove in a ton of garbage like a space shuttle dash board"" so called Boss BR....it should be the BOSS BS!!"
1,not impressed,"So difficult to use it darn near useless, and it's not just me. I gave it to two other people and neither of them had any luck.The people who write these reviews typically are premature with praise.I've had this baby for two years so I've put it through it paces and it is not at all user friendly."
1,Worst program I have EVER used!!!!!!,"Don't waste your money or time!!! I have been creating dvd slideshows for Christmas presents for years using Microsoft's Photostory. (I had to use a different program to burn the slide show to a DVD) Unfortunately, Microsoft discontinued support of their product, so I purchased this product. It is very easy to add pictures to the slide show, but that is where it ends. The program uses 99% of my CPU, as a result, my computer would freeze up constantly (2.6 GHz XP w/ 2 gig ram). There is not an easy way to save your work, so everytime my computer would crash, I lost all of the work I had done. Finally after completing the slideshow it would NOT burn to DVD or the computer - the program would freeze ""trancoding"" the slideshow. Obviously, my children's grandparents will not be receiving their DVD copy this year and I will have to start from scratch after Christmas with a different program."
4,Great for those who want a slide show quick!,"This software is geared towards people who need a simple interface and need to save time making a slide show. The only slide effects are pan and zoom, which can be applied to all randomly or indiviually customized. There are a variety of transition effects however. The program will burn create a slide show in either VCD or DVD format. Once created, this DvD can be ripped and converted to various video formats such as mov or wmv by the inluded media converter. Overall if you need a simple and cheap program, this is the way to go. If you wish to have total control, this may not be the software for you."
3,Adequate for small jobs,"I made a show with 200 slides with this product. It took an hour to produce the DVD, which played fine on my system, with music, only after I hooked up an analog audio line in addition to my digital optics cable.The interface is easy to use. You cannot specify timings or transitions for single slides, only whole shows. I'd recommend it for beginners who want to make shows of 50 or less slides, want a cheaper product, and aren't expecting to get much in the way of customer support."
3,User friendly,"If you want user friendly software to make slideshows this is a great one. The only fault I have found with it, is Id like to choose which transitions to use, but it does it for you. But it makes beautiful slideshows with multiple chapters and you can add whatever music you have. You make your own titles etc also. Great for anyone that isn't so technically inclined."
1,waste of time and money,"Yeah, it's easy to use and the slideshows look ok on the computer, but that's the most I ever got out of it. When I tried to burn any slideshow of any size (even a test slideshow with only one picture) it would tell me that the slideshow doesn't fit onto the dvd. Customer support was unhelpful and eventually stopped responding to my husband's emails. In the end I've spent tons of time creating slideshows that no one will ever see. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Please DO NOT wate your time and money,"I just spent a total of 14 hours going through thousands of pictures and finally uploading 70 pictures for a slideshow, I went to save the project, and it saved only 18. So the hours of sorting and selecting photos as well as uploading them was all wasted, along with the money I paid for this worthless software. I tried uploading more pics again this morning, froze my computer and got the dreaded blue screen serious error message. Please look somewhere else for slideshow fun, this product has made me age 10 years and is hands down the worst purchase I have made in years, and that says alot, cause I buy alot of c-r-a-p !!!!!!!"
4,fantastic,This is the best program I have used for making family DVD's it is so simply yet very profesional.
5,Outstanding Hiking Guide to Durango and Beyond,"Since I've moved to Durango, a ratty copy of the 2nd edition of this book from the public library has been my hiking bible. The 3rd edition is completely revised, chock full of great maps and is really THE reference for day hikes and backpacking trips in the Durango/Silverton area.If you're visiting or living in Southern Colorado, you need this book.Thanks Paul!"
2,Poor Maps,"I purchased the ""Fourth Edition"" of this book after using the 3rd edition that I checked out at the library. I decided I would be using this book enough to warrant a purchase. When I got the fourth edition I was extremely disappointed. The author has done a good job on the text and narration of this book, but that is where the compliments end.When I buy a book with ""Hiking trails"" in the title, I am buying it for the maps. The author did not do a very good job on the maps to start with, which I knew from using the 3rd edition and as a previous reviewer has noted. But the maps in the 4th edition are even worse. No improvements were made, and the quality is much worse. If you sent all of the 3rd edition maps and pictures through a fax machine, that is what the 4th edition looks like. It is not often that a new edition is actually worse than the former one!In short, good narration, bad maps. Save money, buy the 3rd edition and get a better book."
5,Great Product,"Arrived on time as expected. Excellent product. Straightens my hair perfectly when drying. I wish there were more colors available. I wish shipping for the item was not so much. I cannot find a better brush for straightening African American hair with a hair dryer. If you find one, please let me know."
2,Wouldn't buy this again,"My daughter is such a Strawberry Shortcake fan that I was thrilled to have this game for her. It was fun the first time or two, however you have to make sure the colorform stickers get put back on the sheet everytime or they end up all stuck together and LOST! At my house we do well to get the game back in the box and on the shelf, much less have to restick every sticker back on a page before putting it away. Once your stickers are gone, the game is no good. My daughter did enjoy spinning the wheel and counting her strawberries, but this game gets only two stars from this mom of two girls."
3,i love your strawberry cat and dog.,strawberry i l love your dog and your cat is cute but is a little bit of clever that i have ever seen and i remind you with your dog name puffcake is a bit of making the noisy backing of your neew dog and i also have a 3 cat.
3,Thought I got duped also but these actually aren't that bad...,"I too was duped in the parking lot of my bank and when I found out other reviews, I felt like a real jerk. I ended up giving the p-510 to my parents who were still using a stereo set from the 80's... To my surprise, the construction was actually pretty sturdy, I mean it wasn't falling apart or even loosely built. Also, once I got the system set up, the sound was good. Not as good as my BOSE lifestyle 48 system, but this p-510 system turned out not to be such a waste. I paid too much yes but for the $200 average price it is going for, to be fair I would have to say that it is actually worth that price..."
1,"paramax p-612 ,p-512","today some body came in my store and he have paramax P-612 and he selling me $200.00 .he said some one order this item but now he is not taking,i have computer at my store ,i check review this item at amazon its not good then i refused it,he told me this item cost $ 3450.00 but amazon help me for the review of this item DON""T BUY"
5,Vintage book about settling the west,"This book tells a romantic story about a young girl's experience coming out to the Pacific Northwest and establishing a life here in the days of western expansion in this country. That tale is engaging, but the book also illustrates what was popular reading during the 1950s, when it was written. It's nice to read something that tells a good story without assaulting you with graphic scenes of sex, or circumstances and characters designed to shock as much as possible. It's just a good read about people, their relationships and challenges, set in an interesting, unexplored locale."
1,There are better options,"This was a real disappointment. I purchased it before CR had reviewed it based on the 3M name and their decent scoring of other 3M models. Now that the time has come to buy filters I am annoyed by the high price of 80 dollars and to see that it is one of the worst rated ones in recent testing. I had suspected this because other units I'd had in the past seemed to work better. The remote is a convenient feature, as is the auto speed but it doesn't clean air very effectively and is expensive to maintain, I would suggest you not buy this."
5,2nd Best Oz Book I've Ever Read,"This book is as they call it now ""Da Bomb"". I think it is the best L. Frank Baum Oz book.It's got plenty of action and suspence while having a sort of merryness. This is the perfect book for oz fans.If you liked the Wizard Of Oz you will end up liking this one better. Enjoy the book!"
4,the second book,"This is the second book in L. Frank Baum's Oz series of books. In this book the reader is introduced to new citizens of that magical land: Tip, Mombi Jack Pumpkinhead, the wooden Saw-Horse and Ozma. To many readers of the Oz books these characters are just as important and critical to Oz as the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman and Cowardly Lion. Without giving anything away, the story found in this book is needed to understand Oz and the future books in the series as much as The Wizard of Oz, the first book in the series. The character Ozma is especially important. The story line in this book was combined with the story line in Ozma of Oz, the third Oz book, to be the basis of the movie ""Return to Oz."""
4,A Children's Book? Define Child...,"The Land of Oz is..well..WOW. It definately is not just a sappy children's book, it's funny, and truly amusing. Don't call it a child's book, call it a book for all audiences."
1,False story,"I had to read this book for a college class. I thought it was an alright book until I got to one of those personal vignettes about an IIT Madras professor that waxed poetic about the polluted beach he could see from his office. The problem? You can't see the beach from the IIT campus! Yes, it was very polluted at the time I read this (they have cleaned up a lot of their beaches and the streets since then--it's not perfect, but much better than it was previously), but the story called into question the integrity of the information for me. It was a real eye-opener that I had to have a critical eye for publications used in college, but really you do."
4,BANANA BOAT sunblock,"This item arrived on time, very well packed. The only doubt I have is why the expiring date doesn't appear written over the product pack, like over the previous one I have bought in Michigan,USA. Does anything changed about this?"
1,Printing problems,"Many of the puzzles depend on being able to see the difference between levels of gray, such as black numbers on a grey field. At least in the 2005 printing, the printing was done so badly that you can't solve many puzzles because they're illegible.I've also found quite a few errors in the solutions, although it's usually just that they missed some solutions."
2,Poorly printed and written,"There are not enough shades of gray in this book to allow many of the puzzles to be read or understood. Colors range from black to ""not quite as black.""Many of the puzzles are fun, however too many are inaccurate, poorly worded, or have multiple possible solutions.I enjoy having to use my mind to work out different types of puzzles. Too many of the puzzles are simply ""trick questions"" or purposeful misdirection within the instructions or the puzzle itself. It then becomes a game of figuring out of this isA. another poorly worded question where I'll find myself saying, ""that was really stupid""B. impossible to do due to the shadingC. a true fun puzzle!The answer is D. Not worth it."
1,NOT FOR SEWING!,"REALLY DISAPPOINTED. I SEARHED UNDER SEWING ACCESSORIES AND GOT A CHILDS TOY!! I WAS LOOKING FOR LARGE BUTTONS FOR HANGING DISHTOWELS THAT I MADE FOR GIFTS. THIS ITEM SHOULD NOT COME UP IN A SEARCH UNDER CRAFTS OR SEWING UNLESS IT SPECIFICALLY STATES ""CHILDS"" CRAFT ITEM."
4,Nice size,I bought these to make a busy bag for my young sons and just wanted to post that they are a nice size and don't seem to be a choking hazard. I really don't think they could possibly swallow one. I still don't allow them to play with unsupervised.
1,Low Level Craft Item,Very poor quality. There were bumps & bubbles in the plastic & not fit to be used on my projects.
5,great craft buttons,My grandchild loved the buttons. They are so much easier for a very young child to handle. The shapes and colors of the buttons make them very useful as an educational tool
3,They are really BIG!,"They are huge, and fun for kids to play with! I was planning on putting them in my crocheted hats, but thier a little cheap looking (plastic) I may be able to use some!"
5,They mean it when it says,Really big buttons!!!! really great colors... I love them they are another way of teaching kids colors!!! Will buy again
1,Overpriced!!!!!,These cost $1 a pack at wal-mart or slightly more at the grocery store! If you buy them here almost $3 a pack! REDICULOUS!
5,AWE-some,"This book left me wondering if vampires really do exist. It left me in awe. I would rank right next to IT. Sure IT was scary, but Salem's Lot was a lot better and since it was a vampire book it was a lot better. Especially since I am a huge vampire fan."
2,Stinks,Costs too much for practacly nothing. I do not know how it got 4 and a half stars for this. It barly increases graphics and stuff. I have a game tha t said it is made for this and I played I saw no difference. It is NOT A REPLACEMENT OF A CONTROLLER PAK.
2,I don't know,"I mean it's good they made it or you couldn't play yellow cartridges. Like Diddy Kong64. But let me tell you it is a PAIN. First you have to get a butter knife to take the lid off so you can pry the pak in. This takes a good 3 min.Overall;You need it if you want to play ''yellow'',"
1,NINTENDO EXPANSION PAK,"wE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS,GREAT CONDITION, HOWEVER WE HAVE NOT USED YET BECAUSE WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THE GAME SYSTEM THAT WE ORDERED WITH IT!"
1,Appearances are deceiving....,"I requested an 8mb RAM expander ""Exapnsion Pack"" to play certain N64 games. When I ordered the product from the vendor, the image on the site showed ""Nintendo 64 Expansion Pack"" with the Nintendo logo. What I got was some third party manufactured imitation that did not work properly although it said ""Made for Nintendo, 8MB RAM expander."""
1,you will need it,if u are a serious gamer and own a nintendo 64 you will needthis expansion pak because nintendo is now having all of there newgames to require this expansion. Take Donkey Kong 64 you have to have it but it also comes with it so if you are into Donkey Kong get the game and you will also get the expansion!
2,not thaaaaat good,"it doesn't make much of difference, really. it's a shame we HAVE to buy it for playing Zelda: Majora's Mask. I played Tony Hawk's Pro Skating several times, with and without the expansion pack, and i can assure that the difference is almost none. If you're thinking of buying this just for fun (and not for the need of any game) I suggest you to give up. Not worth the money."
3,"It's good, but not essential","I purchased the Expansion Pak only because of the marked improvement in Episode 1 Racer's graphics, and it was a very much improved graphics, but worth the price? Not really.With Perfect Dark coming up, I suppose I'll finally get my money's worth out of the Expansion Pak, but unless your game absolutely needs Expansion Pak (like DK64), there really isn't any reason to buy the Pak. None of my other games have shown any improvement, and outside buying games that need it, there's no way to justify the $ for minimal improvement to only a few games."
3,"A necessity, but over-priced and only slightly impressive","Luckily, I got my expansion pack with Donkey Kong 64,so I didn't have to spend 30 bucks for it. There is a significant difference with the 4 megabytes of extra video memory, but it's nothing revolutionary. However, because quality games like Donkey Kong and Perfect Dark require it, it must be purchased. There are also several games that don't require the expansion pack, but benefit from its use (Top Gear Overdrive, Rouge Squadron). The bottom line: if you're a 64 owner/player, you should probably buy the expansion pack."
1,BEWARE The KNOCK-OFF Third Party brands,Products offered by many marketplace sellers are not original Nintendo Brand. Often they are unlicensed third party knock-off expansion packs. Ive personally had these damage a system and ruin games. Look for sellers offering the real thing by Nintendo. Ive warned you. You can save a few bucks and take your chances. Deviation from the actual product isn't even allowed on Amazon. Their very listings are a violation to begin with. Their feedback speaks for itself.
4,"Works good, exept the price","If we are reviewing just the way the product works then I give it 5 stars.But for just the overall fact that this is necesary to play certain games and that the price is so high is a tad annoying. The Fact that Nintendo did this and made it pretty expensive was really annoying. But If you can get it under 20 or even 15 dollars I still recomend getting it because it is neccesary for great games Like Zelda : Majora's Mask, Donkey Kong 64, or Perfect Dark (which is the reason I bought one.)"
2,Accessory Review,I did not get anything from this product personally and I haven't enjoyed this one at all.
3,Expansion Pak Nintendo64,"The expansion pak was shiiped in a timely manner. Stars rating was not based on satisfaction of product, I was asked to rate the ""game"" and seeing as how it isn't a game that is where the ratings came from."
1,Nintendo hits jackpot,"Nintendo has hit the jackpot with the new expansion pak for nintendo 64. The gamers are the ones being hurt here. Why make an expanson pak, which isnt very noticable in graphics and game play?? Almost all popular new games being released require this pak, Perfect Dark needs one jsut to play the 1 player missions, the highlight of the game if you ask me. TWINE also requires this pak, and i just do not have the time or MONEY$$ to add hardware to my 64. I think they need to leave the 64 alone, and start workin on upgrades for the POWER CUBE."
4,think before you buy,Don't buy one of these unless you don't plan on buying Donkey Kong. One is included inside that game.
5,Expansion,"Expansion pack works perfectly, I've used it on several games now. What the seller does not make clear is that this is a third party expansion pak, not Nintendo licensed. That does not matter to me, but if for whatever reason you want an official one you should look elsewhere."
4,Important for Certain Games,"This expansion pak is necessary to unlock all of the features for certain games. I bought it for Perfect Dark, and it lets me play the full multiplayer mode and displays the graphics much better; a worthwhile purcahse."
4,Great little add-on,"This little gadget is well worth the money, and it's not that hard to install at all. It comes with a plastic key that enables you to take out the old jumper pak and put this new expansion pak in. This makes N64 games better than before, especially the ones that have hi-res support for it (i.e. Turok 2 and Rogue Squadron) And some games do in fact require it for them to run properly (i.e. Donkey Kong and Perfect Dark). This does NOT make the N64 better than the PS1, in fact, it never was better than the PS1 nor will it ever be. But it does create smoother textures and backgrounds, giving your video game experience more of a realistic view."
3,Just some quick information,"If you have seen this on the ""people who bought Donkey Kong 64 also bought these items list"" dont buy it. Donkey Kong 64 is prepackaged with a Memory Expansion. (As it is the first N64 game to require it)."
5,More RAM better play,"The N64 expansion pak is a must have accessory. Like adding RAM to a PC the pak adds the ability for better graphics and enhanced gameplay. Games like the new Zelda require the unit to even play, but it worth the expense. Imagine if Nintendo made a 64MB pak, then you could play 128bit games without buying a PS2 and save a bunch of money. ... once you see what happens to games after you get it, you'll be impressed.Even still after you buy the pak and the price of the game it is stil the 2nd lowest priced system on the market and it's still better then PS1. None of the other systems have the ability to add RAM, if Nintendo takes full advantage of this option on N64, the demand for this system would increase drastically and the games would be Ultra-Intensive.At least make getting the pak worth-while, purchase a games like DK64 that comes with the pack and you'll see the value.Happy Gaming!"
3,Review,I just bought the expansion pack so I could play Donkey Kong which is a cool game even though its old.
4,Expansion Pak,"N64 Expansion Pak Expensive yet very worth it. It is excellent for games that use it because it allows you to really know what that game is like. for example it basicly gives your N64 more memory than it already has, making that game better than it already was. Such as a computer."
4,its okay,"i just bought an n64, but i've played one before with and without the expansion pak. though the pak does help with the graphics the n64 still can't touch the dreamcast or ps2 with regards to graphics. still the pak does let you play perfect dark so it is a must have."
3,Dosen't do anything,"The only game I see a signifigant amount of change is Road Rash 64. All the other games has does little or no change. Look at Rouge Squadron, I see no change.(maybe the ships look better) Most of the games already have great graphics, like Turok 2 ,Turok Rage Wars,Rush 2, Rush 2049,and Rouge Squadron."
2,"The uneeded ""upgrade""","Frankly, I am not pleased with the expansion pack. For one thing, it's not nescecery in over half the games you play, For example: Rouge Squadren is 10 times better without the expansion pack than DK is with it. But we must buy it to play almost any N 64 games that come out now. In no time there will be an even more upgraded version of the expansion pack and we'll be forced to empty our wallets again. Bottom line: It's a load of rubish. The one game I've played that seemed like it really needed it was perfect dark."
3,Buy it only if you have to,"I bought it because i have some games that need it, but it doesnt make any difference in graphics from my stand point."
1,"the games are fun, the pak has glitched","i started playing a game and my console and games all work fine. i needed the expansion pak for one of my games. when i put it in, part way through the game, it froze. i thought it was the game, so i put in another one of my games and it froze too. Now i have to find a new expansion pak. i wouldnt trust the seller. when i bought it, they said it was in working codition, and they lied to me."
3,Book in rougher shape tha advertised,"Listed as good; there was a lot of wear and damage to the spine, etc. But it was delivered on time, and still in so so shape.. OK"
2,Book was in good shape. Took almost 3 weeks to recieve it.,If you are prepared to wait almost a month with this person. Then go ahead and buy it from them.
3,pretty good,"this is not a bad spanish book. i don't know if i would say it is great. lots of group activities that are helpful, but they are pretty simple and repetitive. they need to be a little more thoughtful and put in lots of DIFFERENT activities. one last, quite frustrating thing, there is only a spanish-english dictionary in the back. extremely irritating because this is a spanish 1-2 book, and anytime you want to look up a word, you'll need to consult another dictionary."
5,Reflections from a Mother's Heart,I recommend every Mother get this book and fill it out for their children. It is a wonderful thing to leave your children. It will give your children a great insight into who you really are. I did this for our children and I got the one for Father's for my husband to fill out also.
3,Fine if you are a very devout Christian...,"I was given a copy of this journal as a gift, and I have to say, I'll probably be leaving some blank pages, or writing some things that the average parent wouldn't in the pages of this book. Too many of the questions are centered around religion, and not enough of them about other aspects of one's life. If sharing your religious views with posterity is a big part of this type of project, it's a fine book, but otherwise, find something else. Not to hurt the feelings of the person who gave this to me, but I'll be finding another journal to fill in the gaps this one leaves..."
2,Highly religous.,"I bought Reflections from a Mother's Heart as well as A Father's Legacy. When I first received the books, I was very excited because they were beautiful on the outside. The questions at first seemed great, until I realized that 1/3 of the book was questions about God, church, Christmas and Christianity. Coming from a family of mixed religion, these books were completely inappropraite and from information provided on Amazon, I did not know this when I purchased it. Unless you are a hardcore Christian, I would not reccomend these books. I was beyond disappointed about these books. I am debating on keeping them and maybe changing some of the questions, but I will have to see."
5,Excellent Item,I have found this book to be helpful in my journey to pass on my heritage and legacy to my future daughter or son.
4,very good transaction,"Just as described - new book - thank you seller and Post Office for the ""very"" quick delivery - this saved me ALOT of time money - an obscure book, but finding it was easy on Amazon"
5,Reflections From A Mother's Heart,"An excellent way to record those seldom talked about items that a Mother would want her child to remember...or a child would want to remember about their Mother. Use it as kind of a ""time capsule"" item! Great gift idea!"
4,Stories from home,"Being elderly, starting to get forgetful and having a tremendous love of family, as well as burning desire to search further into our family history, I realized how important it is for me to share all of our family ""stories"" with my daughter with not just spoken but also with written words. This little book really fits the bill! When it came and my daughter realized what I had gotten, tears formed in her eyes because she knew what a treasure she would have in her possession after I was gone."
4,A Day in the Life of America,"This book is an amazing discription of the different cultures and lives of the people of America. Just by seeing these pictures of ordinary people, you are able to discover the main purpose of this country - freedom. The freedom to live your life the way you want to."
5,Diamonds in the Rough,"I'd say that if you are unfamiliar with Henry ALford's work, this is probably not the book to get. Look at Municipal Bondage, his first book; or, if you're interested in show business, Big Kiss, his third book.Out There is fun, but it's not really stunt journalism, which is what he's best at."
2,"OUT THERE, A FAILURE TO FIND THE INTERNET'S FUNNIEST PERSON!","Perhaps I'm quibbling, but I am predisposed to favor authors who know their place. It is all very well to be an eloquent and elite user of words, but some who fit this description feel the need to showcase their writing ability at 15,000 words a clip. To which I say, No, no, no - you are not really writing a book; you are someone who is taking advantage of a publishing contract at Random House by having a novelty book published that dismally fails in it's efforts to find the funniest person on the internet!"
3,1970 story,"Love merlin and his other 2 books on Praise are million sellers. This was a fluff piece. its ok, but the other 2 books on Praise have power,,,whe we sing,...no singing no power i bought 100 of his books to give out.."
3,Get the German version instead...,"Tag und Nacht (the original German version of this album) was my favorite album of 2005. I was excited upon learning that Schiller was releasing the album in the US under the moniker of ""Day and Night"" but then I saw the tracklisting. For whatever reason, three of the original tracks (including the two singles - Die Nacht and Der Tag) have been replaced with other songs. Normally I wouldn't care as much but my personal favorite track - ""Der Tag"" - was replaced with, oh what's that, a song that was already released on a different album?!? Yep that's right, ""The Smile"" (track #11) was already on their 2003 album. I guess it's some kind of American marketing scheme. My advice? If you really like Schiller, get the German version called ""Tag und Nacht"" - this original version flows better overall and also comes with a bonus disc with five additional tracks on it."
5,Splendid!,"Out of all the Christmas CDs I've purchased over the years, this is my favorite. The tunes are subtle, calming and unobtrusive. There is a wide variety of tunes, from well known to more obscure titles. I would highly recommend Ms. Papajohn's work."
3,Memories vs Quality,"This is a great video for a rainy day and you want your kids to feel sorry for you and your childhood...""That's what you *had* to watch when you were our age?"" You can tell your kids, ""They never closed school for only 5 or 6 inches of snow"" and they will roll their eyes thinking, ""Yeah right, Mom."" But when you tell your kids you only had a handful of cartoon characters in your days...You can always pull out this video and prove it. When they see the poor quality...all that scratchy snow and jerking, they realize [albeit only for the moment] what horrible Saturday mornings you had as a child. I would actually give this video 2.5 stars...2 for nostalgia and 1/2 for quality."
3,Peter Levenda's work tells of his interest in the occult.,"If you reread this work, you overcome your impression of how interesting the occult involvement has been in modern day society, and you start to see a need Mr. Levenda had in writing his book. But I am of the opinion that Levenda is inexperienced in book presentation.He himself admits that the book changed and evolved very dramatically from when he had first set out to present a story. This speaks of a presumed novice approach to his endeavor, and lends a certain weakness to any centralized theme he might have tried to relate. Perhaps more experience would have lent him better results.The most remarkable thing about Levenda seems to be his own struggle with the occult that comes out in bits and pieces. It would be interesting to know more about the author but that appears difficult to obtain. It appears as if he has done a massive literature search though at times it seems as if he conveniently applied it to personal experiences."
2,Interesting yet personally biased,"With Unholy Alliance, Mr. Levenda chronicles how esoteric andoccult books as well as organizations influenced Hitler and the ThirdReich in their relentless quest to create an elite, Aryan superrace.While the material is exhaustingly detailed and concise,Peter's leftism tends to rear it's ugly head one too many times.For example, while he villifies Hitler for being the monster that he was,people like Mao and Che Guevera are painted as heroes in addition to his sympathy for the Communist ideology.Indeed, one is at times almost reminded of Noam Chomsky when Peter criticizes U.S intervention in Latin America even though the U.S was their to help rather than hinder. At best, Peter Levenda is an occult expert who really doesn't tell you anything that a true occultist would already know. At worst, he sounds just like another whining leftist who's upset that Communism has been battled and defeated all over the world by right wing groups."
3,Portable chair,"After sitting for awhile it gets a little uncomfortable, but so do many regular chairs. Being so easily portable it is comfortable enough with a little position adjustment every so often."
5,awesome book,for years i have been an nsync fan. & this book is perfect for the biggest nsync. the book has alot of cool pictures & short bio. about each member too.
3,The Fart Book,"The book was not in the best condition but okay i guess, wish it looked a little newer. Satisfied i guess."
5,Best of the best!,"Put Simply, this is the best Painkiller album there is. Fantastic! Fierce Bass, Hard-core Sax-chops, Furious Drumming - all to the delight of the ear. Free Rock, maybe? Emotional tunes that go places. Enjoy!"
4,Phenomenal Woman,"Usually I can be critical of the Schlessinger series because I know about the subjects than what the series presents. However, I have seen Bethune's face more than I've heard facts about her. This helped me to enjoy this work. Bethune was an extraordinary educator. Not having a Ph.D. didn't stop her from opening a college. She worked for FDR and can be seen as the spiritual ancestors of Maxine Waters, Barbara Lee, and ugh!, Condie Rice. This work says Bethune and her husband departed, but it doesn't say if they ever officially divorced. I question whether that means she and her former amour were celibate forever or not. This would be a great work to show for young Black girls interested in educational careers. Though the word ""sexism"" is spoken by one interviewee, I do question that ""feminist"" could have been said more. Perhaps the absence of that term has to do with the times and Bethune's pro-woman work that did not have to do with suffrage."
1,Outdated!,"I bought Systeme-D and found out that is an outdated program that works with the pre-historic Microsoft Word 6.0 and is now worthless. I don't think it should be sold any longer until the program is updated. If you have the pre-historic Systeme-D version 3.0, don't bother looking for any software updates because there isn't any."
3,Introductory,"A basic introductory text. Geared towards users of ISDN as a help text on installation and purchase. You'll get some understand of the technology behind ISDN but not much. The book itself says it is of an ""introductory"" level and I have to agree. This book won't serve as a reference book.Buy it, read it, toss it. Don't buy it if you already know something about ISDN."
3,Analysis of La Follette's Major Speeches,"Burgchardt does a somewhat interesting job here with a fairly dull topic, in analyzing themes in the speeches of Robert La Follette, Sr. Some historical and biographical information is nicely interwoven, but the oratory is the major topic. Burgchardt shows how La Follette often relied on the condemnation of a great and cunning evil seeking to destroy morality, whether it be Iago in Othello, corporatists, oleomargarine or railroad owners. The speeches don't ""read"" all that well and probably were more interesting to hear first-hand, but the book overall is an interesting study. Not something I would buy to own, but I don't regret the time I spent reading it either."
3,Compaq Presario 2100 Main Battery Review,"This product is the cheapest in its category. I have been using it for a week and realised that the battery runs ~ 2 hours and 40 mins on full charge. This is way lower than what the original battery on my 2100 Presario which could do close to 4 hours. Obviously, you get the quality that you pay for. Other than that I have no complaints. I think I will take a hit when it comes to how long this battery will last as well. The orignal batteries lasted well over 3 years."
5,Bandsaw Blade,The bandsaw blade is exactly as promised. I had no trouble installing the blade and it makes it much easier to cut tree limbs or other wood down to the size I need. Would buy this blade again.
1,New Age Nonsense,"After reading other reviews I guess I'm the only one who felt ripped off by this CD. I wanted real Red flute music but I got synthesized, saccharine, Americanized junk by players who should be ashamed of the way they have commercialized and bowdlerized their heritage. I mean, really - tweeting birds, bubbling brooks, Latin style drum beats - pulleeze! All these people ""modernizing"" the music and being ""creative"". Bunk! I would have liked to have known just how untraditional this was before I ordered it (no samples to listen to). Well, win some, lose some!"
5,relaxing and meditative,Wonderful relaxing music. Excellent when used for at home spa. Assists with meditation and brings onself closer to their spirituality. Not to mention calming to cats.
5,Depth and quality...outstanding book!,"I didn't know exactly what to expect when I began reading this commentary, but it quickly became clear to me that this book was different than any commentary I had read before. Not only was it solid in research and background information, but its ability to apply the truths of the Old Testament to my life today was amazing. This book is written in such a way that can benefit the beginner and the scholar. It is easy to understand, as well as deep and moving in its insights. Not only did it increase my knowledge, but more importantly, it was a powerful tool for increasing my intimacy with Christ. I highly recommend this book."
4,A Must Read,"I have read a number of commentaries on the book of Genesis and this is one of my favorites. Let's face it, for the Christian faith the importance of Genesis is paramount. Walton gives a fair and balanced treatment of the text and pulls in the necessary elements of culture in order to understand the ancient Near Eastern worldview in which Israel was birthed. Just as we in the 21st century have certain similarities with our culture, we cannot expect Israel to be untouched by theirs or expect God's revelation to them to be devoid of interaction with the culture. Whether the reader agrees with his conclusions or not, Walton's insights are very helpful."
1,Kindle version awful,"I bought the Kindle version of this work thinking it would be a great help in my exegesis unit at college. However the Kindle version is useless; it has no table of contents and no way of quickly going to the passage being looked for, you literally have to click through the whole book to find what you are looking for."
3,One for the scholars,"As a direct source this book is valuable and needed. To the casual reader of history (like myself) it is a bit of a drag. The book has highlights but the authors are writing it to their contemporaries. It is difficult for the modern reader to grasp exactly what is happening. I think a book with maps and further explanations as to motivations and battle tactics (to a layman like me) would have been of greater interest. One thing I can say, however, is that you get a first hand look at what Caesar must have been like. The book clearly shows his side in the most favorable light (not surprising) but not as much as one would think."
3,Great book,"An account of the civil war that had to happen with two such colossal egos as Caesar and Pompey. This is a less famous episode than the Octavian-Anthony war, but just as important, as it laid the ground for the appointment of a dictator which eventually evolved into the position of emperor, and also Caesars death. Not as well written or as clear as Caesars commentaries from Gaul, but give a clearer insight into the divisions in Roman politics, as others are thought to have contributed to the writings. A great follow up to Caesars commentaries from Gaul."
4,"smooth, striking. and sexy","The story takes place in 1994 at the beginning of the baseball strike and baseball reporter Kate Henry has no games to cover.She is at home in Toronto contemplating the strike.She and two teenage friends share some concern for an apparently homeless woman,Maggie, who lives in an alley near their apartment. Their is some racial unrest in Toronto since the shooting of a black man by the police...This is a well written,well plotted and fascinating study of the homeless,the difficulties of policework, and the affects of trauma on relationships. A very enjoyable read with an active, intelligent, and capable heroine.The other characters are believable and fun."
4,Voces Y Viastas: Workbook and Tape Manual,"This workbook helped me to understand my spanish courses better. I got an A. The teacher really appreciated the extra effort. I got to read, write, and say what I was learning."
3,Toland-In and Out of Ireland,Book in general was informative but I found nothing specific that was linked to myToland family. The book was alright.
2,What could have been,"Lurking in the back of these songs is a fantastic voice singing brilliant lyrics. Unfortunately, it is buried beneath a mishmash of keyboards and guitars. The guitar playing is heavy-handed, sometimes seemingly off-key, and some songs appear to have no rhythm to speak of. The shame is, the singer is another Jon Anderson (the singer from Yes, not the 1980 independent presidential candidate), and never before have I heard Foucault turned successfully into song lyrics. I doubt most listeners even know what metonymy is, but I love it! In fact, this song ""The Order in Things"" is the one exception, where the voice soars above the ruckus (although I think the real English title of Foucault's Les Mots et les Choses is ""The Order OF Things""). If only the whole album was like this track..."
5,"Beautifully Subtle, Almost Disconnected Sacred Sounds","When I first picked up this recording on vinyl back in the mid 1980s as a teenager, I had never heard any music from the Korean shamanistic tradition & not much by Kaiser or Noyes. What I felt when first hearing it was a complete fascination while simultaneously being dumbfounded beyond belief at its otherworldly structure.Like having a key to a door, that you're sure is the right one, but still won't open the door--I've listened to it over & over again through the years, looking for a way to comprehend its masterful & improvisational presentation. I don't know how or why, but I finally broke through to its glory one day. An extraordinary experience that has inspired me to seek out other more experimental, non-narrative sounds of the world. Highly recommended."
1,newer edition available,Would like to know why Amazon doesn't have the 2006 or even the 2003 edition?
4,Classic Bromby,"Maybe just a little fire has gone from the belly of the Bromberg, but the playing band the wailing is as authentic as hell. I love it. But then I have most of his stuff. Encore! Encore!"
4,Finding a Forgotten Temple,"Niki Collins-Queen has written a truly enjoyable book. ""Earth, The Forgotten Temple"" touches the reader on at least three levels:* It's informative - Niki tells you just enough background information about her experiences to both give you an understanding of her situations and to teach you about different topics; like apartheid, backpacking and wildlife.* It's entertaining - Living through Niki's adventures with her is truly refreshing and cathartic.* It's spiritually enlightening - Sharing in Niki's awakenings of the awe, power and beauty of nature is a religious experience I suggest to anyone.I found Niki's book similar to the wonderful stories told by Marlo Morgan and Tom Brown Jr.While as a man regularly active the outdoors, I delighted in this book, I think both women who have only dreamed about experiencing the outdoors as well as those that currently do enjoy the outdoors will find her book especially empowering."
1,Awful,"The nadir of Italian comedy is Alvaro Vitali: comedy for idiots. If facial mugging puts you in stitches, then you might enjoy those seconds. MYA put a naked lady on the front cover to help sell this piece of garbage, but unless want a 3 second clip of obvious plastic boobies then don't bother. You'll see more of the male Vitali, which is not pretty nor funny--eeww! Those are the two selling points of this movie. Take it or leave it. I suggest the latter.For those interested, this is anamorphic widescreen."
5,Kids are not small adults!,"I bought this book after hearing Dr. Buff on the radio (WDBO-AM). He gives tips (tricks) that are obvious but you'd never think about them until you READ them! So I read the entire book in one weekend and earmarked the tips I wanted to try, one at a time.For me, the most profound was that kids between 7 and 12 can't understand adult logic, even if you use simple words in their vocabulary. The next trick I tried for one of the kid's birthdays - I saved money, bought fewer gifts, and got THE gift that was really wanted, not just a fad gift. The third trick will start this weekend - getting the kids to eat vegetables!Almost like having a manual for raising kids! Hospitals should provide this books as part of the New Parents gift bag."
2,Better than his other two but still stinks,"I'm disenchanted by this author. I bought all three of his books here on Amazon and thank goodness I bought them used or else I'd be livid! What a waste of time. No such 'trick(s)' in this book! Just common sense stuff that you already know. It's all a marketing ploy to get you to buy a book that promises psychological tricks but when you read it, there's no tricks, but rather plain & simple parenting. Oooooh boy! That's so hard to do I need a psychologist to tell me how it's done."
3,Not there best effort,"I'm a big A.C. fan, i have most there releases in one form or another. This album was one of the last ones i picked up, and was one of the most disappointing. Don't get me wrong, i think it was good, but pales in comparison to its to cd predicessers(sp?) - morbid florist and everyone should be killed. the main reason i didn't like this album was its volume level, for some unkown reason this album plays at a considerably lower volume than all my other a.c. albums, to me alomost ruins. This record however was a success in helping A.C. transistion from noise to grind. I would recommend this album to any A.C. fan, any person looking for an introduction to the band would be safer with morbid florist."
2,"Great book, if you are a first time vistor to WDW","This book is really good to get a lot of information if you are a first time visitor. However, for us veteran of WDW, this book just isn't for you! It's the same old info. that you can also find in other books. One things that may be convenient, or a security hazard...you can store information in the pockets provided. However, this info. such as hotels, family, tickets, airlines, is really quite a security hazard if you think about it. I would not suggest this book."
4,"Excellent ""carry with you"" guide to WDW.","An excellent guide that is small enough to carry with you throughout the WDW environments.Contains *THE* definitive guide to the resorts with maps.The coverage of the attractions is somewhat light, but is covered in other guidebooks. Perhaps that is an advantage. Too much material on the attractions would weigh the book down and make it harder to carry.Another big plus is the pocket organizers in the back. A great place to keep your tickets, mementos, etc."
5,Invaluable resource!,"When I purchased the Passporter initially I had know idea how valuable it would be. It was a concise tour guide book and provided me with a way to manage all of our planning details as we prepared for our trip. The Passport pockets are an awesome way to keep track of confirmations, tickets, and receipts, and the maps and resort information are fabulous. Their website became my #1 source of information on making this the best trip ever. Hands down the best resource I've found!"
4,"Good resource, BUT...","As a 22 time extended stay veteran of WDW, I found this book very detailed in many things. I would caution anyone to ignore the authors rankings of rides and food. I thought they ranked a lot of things low. The Readers Choice rankings are a better veiwpoint. I suggest doing as much as possible and - you make the rank. Pay close attention to the way they ranked food. It can be a little misleading, after all a cheeseburger is a cheeseburger, be careful. The maps and folders are useful to try to remember after your trip what you did and when you did it. I would suggest for first timers to get a Birnbaum's WDW to compliment this book. It gives some details for the attractions that is not in the Passporter. Get all of the facts before going to WDW. Make up your own mind and have a great trip. As for the authors, by looking at the way they ranked some of the rides and food I am curious to why they even like the place."
5,The Best WDW guide around!,"When this book was recommended, I thought - oh, another WDW book, and bought it because you can never have too many! This far surpassed my expectations! I'm too organized for my own good, and this book will help me keep our trip on track! From its reviews of hotels, resorts and places to go, to the way you can keep all your notes and documents in one place, this book is a MUST HAVE for anyone going to see the Mouse! I highly recommend it and only wish I would have gotten it sooner!!"
2,Get this only if you are new to WDW,"It is very light on all ride and event descriptions, not even elaborating on the Halloween and Christmas Parties, Grad Nights, parades and other special events that make WDW so special. It misses the opportunity to describe the viewing locations for parades and fireworks, as well as the ""unusual"" - talking trashcans, etc.!If you've never been, this book is a place to start. But it really doesn't tell you about the real WDW in enough detail to make travel and touring plans.The hotel descriptions and room recommendations are good, and the pockets would come in handy, but there's just not enough meat."
3,Interesting concept; execution needs to be tweaked a bit,"This guide is designed to be USED, more so than other WDW guides I have. The pocket pages look like they'll be helpful to plan before, keep track during, and remember after the trip. These pocket pages are the best part of the book; I wish they were sold separately. I don't see myself carrying this whole book around in the parks; it's just too big, unless you take a back pack or tote bag to put it in. The pages for autographs are a waste of space; if I'm interested in autographs, I'll get an autograph book. The ratings/descriptions of restaurants and attractions are not detailed enough - the Unofficial Guide does this much better."
4,"Has lots of ""inside info""","This Disney guidebook was very helpful to us because the authors give their own opinions of the rides, attractions, resorts, and restaurants, as well as the opinions of their readers. They also give tips and advice based on their own personal experiences. Another great feature is the maps of each resort which can help you decide which area or building you might prefer. The maps also show which buildings are smoking buildings. We used the Passporter in planning our 3rd trip to Disney and it was very helpful!"
2,Do you expect me to carry this book with me around the park?,"Oh please. If you have read any other Disney books (especially the unofficial guide) than you won't pick up anything new here. The information is vague. As far as the pockets for holding your stuff, it is a nice idea, but do you really think I want to carry a book this size around Orlando? I like to travel light around the parks and this book will not be coming along for the ride."
5,Great travel Guide For Disney World,"I recievd this book about three days ago. I must say that it is vastly improved when compared to the 1999 passporter. They have organized the restaraunt guides by the parks that they are at. They have ratings for the park attractions based on the author's opinions as well as the opinions of the park goers. The also have excellent overviews of Disney resorts along with resort area maps. The front and rear book covers have fold out maps, in color, as well as phone numbers to use while your at the parks. It also has information on the often overlooked behind the scenes tours offered at disney. Finally, this book has many more places to write your trip itinerary as well as pockets to keep important things, like plane tickets and park passes. While you are at the parks you can use these pockets to keep receipts and maps from the parks. If you are going to Disney this book is a must have."
5,A must-have book for anyone planning a Disney World Vacation,"This is the most comprehensive and easy-to-read guidebook for Walt Disney World that I have ever seen.It is the very best source for on-site hotel information and includes maps of WDW resorts, room layouts, amenities, WDW transportation system times to theme parks, and more.Outstanding summaries of all major and minor attractions throughout Disney World include information on the waterparks, Downtown Disney, and Disney Quest.Whether you're a first-time Disney visitor or a seasoned Mouseketeer, you'll find this informative and visually pleasing guide to be invaluable. An added bonus for scrapbookers are the memory pockets that provide a handy place for journaling and keeping momentos from your trip.If you only buy one guide for Disney World, make it this one -- you won't be sorry!"
3,Leica Stabilite Binocular Tripod Adapter,"I purchased the Leica Stabilite Binocular Tripod Adapter (new) and so far have used it twice in the field with a vortex tripod. The basic design works well. However, during my first use I apparently pulled the rubber strap too hard and it broke off at the section where the wire fastener bar is located. I expected the product design to be more robust, coming with the Leica brand name. Word of caution, be gentle with streching the rubber strap to secure your binocular. Otherwise, it is a good product. I am now looking for a replacement strap."
5,Best Snowboarding Game Ever,"This game is excellent. Any fan of snowboarding will love this game. This game has the best qualities. The soundtrack is phenomenal, the voices of the characters are some well known people, the controls and graphics are excellent, and how many snowboarding games has a guy with a huge orange 'fro named Eddie(and he's voiced by David Arquette). This game is excellent I recommend this game to everyone."
4,ssx tricky,overall a good game and good value. only bug in the game is where you trip over invisible bumps. never played the first ssx but this one is definitely worth buying.
2,Get the original - it's better,"The original SSX game was so much faster/more enjoyable to play then this version. Save your money, on the PS2, buy the discounted original title SSX"
1,SSX TRICKY HYPE=PURE CRAP,This game is a total waste of $... . I didn't buy the game thank god but I rented it. This game is worthless. The handling of the characters are horrible. The best gamer in the world couldn't play well with the handling. Don't waste your money on this game but buy the original because it's better than SSX Tricky. This game should be taken off the market and the discs should be used in skeet shooting.
4,Tricky Critique,"Well here it is the long awaited sequel to the MOTHER of all snowboarding games. And there it goes :( . This game needs alot of work, it seemed a little rushed. First and foremost two words... PLAY VALUE. This game has little of it. There is not enough options or tracks. The dialogue gets to be very annoying very soon. Once you max out your players stats you are left with 50 dollars worth of repetition. The addition of the signature and uber tricks are a refreshing change but not worth the money. My advice stick with the first SSX. That's it from me. I'm out"
4,"Fast, Fun and Worth The Price",I never owned the orginal SSX because I didn't buy my PS2 right away. When SSX Tricky came out I thought I'd give it a shot even if sports games weren't my thing. My wife thought I had wasted out money but it was a blast for months. I played non-stop for weeks and I still pick it up now and then since I've already unlocked everything. The tracks are big and so are the tricks you pull off. Two player mode is fun but it's kinda tough to see the players that well on split screen and still be able to see the area around your player. It's not a snowboarding game for those who want realism but it's for anybody that wants to fly high and have fun.
4,The Game,This is by far the best game I have EVER played in my life. You can do so many things. This is one of those games that is hard but you still like playing it. I have played some games that are so hard I dont even want to play it again. This is not like that though. It is AWESOME. Very addicting. I very highly recomend this game!
4,So hot it hurts...,I am a huge SSX fan and this builds right up on it. The characters are improved although they did little to no improvement on the graphics. The new tricks and tracks are hella-sweet. Hours and hours of entertainment. New tunes. A must have for any PS2 collection.
5,The Best Game Ever,"This is a game that cannot be beat. Good game options, having more options of things to do than you can believe. The special Uber moves are the most amazing thing I, personally, have ever seen. Showoffs are great, trying to beat the cutoff. A must buy:Pros: Amazing Uber moves, good racing, great personalized taunts, cool tricksCons: Some of the characters are stupid-- but does that matter?"
5,Absolutely the best title in extreme sports,"I have played several SSX titles now and this one stands out as the best. Each character is unique, with individual super tricks, smart comments, wild outfits, and snowboard designs (and styles). The control scheme perfectly fits the PS2's controller, the courses are vast and colorful, and once you earn that last gold medal, you will be ready to start right over again with another character. The memory card saves the five best times and five best showoff scores for each course. The disc also contains behind-the-scenes making-of DVD content from EA Big."
1,horrible,"this game is very very VERY horrible. the only people who could like such a game are little kids. its so unrealistic it makes me wanna throw up. i can do wit some stuff, like THPS, thats unrealistic, but its not kickflip shuv-it 180 backflip on a snowboard, or sumthin stupid like that. u can ride the board in the air like a bull for christs sake.a good snowboarding game is espn xgames snowboarding, thats realistic. or amped for xbox, thats very good. but dont waste ur money on this horrible horrible game. its so bad i wanna cry.p.s. i only gave this 1 star b-cuz i couldnt go to -923.peace"
2,Hard to use,This was my first install and I found this kit very hard to figure out and use. The final results were not very clean. This could be all my fault as a newbie.
4,The Spirit of Diana,"Produced for British television and subsequently banned from it, THE SPIRIT OF DIANA sees a group of psychics converge on both St. Paul's Cathedral and in the Paris tunnel where Princess Diana was killed in 1997 in an attempt to contact her spirit. Does she have any messages to convey? Who did she really love? Was her death truly an accident? These are the probing questions the seance will attempt to answer. Also includes interviews with Mohammed Al Fayed, Andrew Morton, and more. A very well done documentary of the Princess and the controversy surrounding her untimely passing."
2,Not very sturdy,this is flimsy. It doesn't sit level on a floor and the hook to hold the dryer in position works on 1 side and the other side has to be held in position and then jammed. Don't buy it.
4,Pinch Pots and Color,"This is an informative, useful book on making pinch pots of many different varieties (open forms, necked forms, near-closed forms, etc.). The two longest sections are the one on making pinch pots and the one on color. There's also a chapter on sawdust kilns, plus appendixes. A useful book with many beautiful photographs."
3,Finding one's way with clay,The book overall is a good resource. I had hoped for more pinch pot ideas. The book was a bit limited.
5,no complaints,"I like Wiha screwdriver's but I like Starrett ones better. Under heavy torque, I have broken or bent Wiha screwdriver heads, but haven't ever had issues with Starrett."
1,Failure to address the REAL issue,"The author has compiled a number of essays and stories about the Kargil war, yet he fails to address the central issue of this problem: India's illegal and brutal occupation of Kashmir. If this occupation was not a reality, the Kargil war would not have happened! As long as Indian forces continue to suppress the people of Kashmir, such clashes and skirmishes will continue to happen."
1,war propaganda,This book is nothing more than an attempt to make it seem likethat India managed to retake the Kargil area because of the skill andcourage of the Indian army. What needs to be mentioned is that 300 or so Kashmiri freedom fighters held off over 40 THOUSAND Indian troops supported by artillery and air force jets for almost three months before withdrawing. The book is a mediocre attempt to glorify the horrors of war and to create war hysteria among the Indian readers. I wasted my money buying this book and I strongly urge you to NOT repeat the mistake I have aleady made...
2,Poor,"This text is poorly written and hard to understand and I would recommend that in the future, professors who are teaching a course on Systems look a little further to find a better written and more clearly presented text."
1,Very disappointed with this book! I wish I've read reviews before I bought it..,"Do people actually think this book is good or insightful?The more I read this book the more confused and angry I get. Angry that I am wasting my time and money.This book is using fish metaphor and quotes from other people over and over again. Seriously, there are more quotes then his own words.The words are meaningless yet it tries to look like there is meaning. There are no useful tips, no honest opinion, and no advise. It is very busy proving why men are like fish. That's it. For example, It says that you have to choose the right bait and explain why you should do so, but no explaining on how to choose the right bait what so ever. Just going around words and fishing metaphors and looks like it tries to confuse you.There are just vague and big and confusing words one after another. Totally waste of my time!I wonder if I can get a refund in Kindle store."
2,this book sucks!!!,it doesn't help anything. Why Men Like Bitches are much more to the point and helps you understand things more.
2,All Analogies,"All the author really does is explain how men are like fish. He gives many examples (I had no idea there would be so many), but none were really helpful or applicable to life (unless I was suddenly given a pop quiz relating men to fish). I think I ended up throwing this book in the trash."
3,Tells you what you need to do but not how to do it,"What i hated about this book is that it tells you ""metaphors"" and ""similies"" for example he says chase a man until he catches you and at the same time he says let the man be the aggresor but he does not give you any tips or more info on how you can do these things. I liked the rules books more because they give clear guidelines and more usefull tips"
1,Pass on this one,"Talk about fluff! I love the fishing analogy used throughout this book. And while I agree with all the points the author makes, not once did I feel as if any one point was developed thoroughly enough to prove useful for anyone. It's all good and well to use the many cute metaphores and analogies, but without any specific action plans to put them to use, all they are is ""cute"". This book is definitely a light and fun read, but there isn't much value in fun when it gives you no specifics on which to go on. This is definitely not a book I'd recommend if you're looking for anything beyond simple entertainment."
1,Fish are Fish - Men Aren't,"This book's recent second edition (I didn't read the first) is amazingly trite. I get the impression that Nakamoto had a tiny kernel of an idea and decided, somewhat unsuccessfully, to expand it into a ""self-help"" advice book. I did, however, enjoy seeing how many clichés (often conflicting the sense of previously-cited ones) he could pack into his work. The title's metaphor makes one wonder why, if a man were truly a like a fish, a woman would want to land one: if a woman actually caught a fish, she certainly wouldn't plan to marry it, she'd be more likely pan-fry it. But perhaps the author unwittingly expresses my opinion best when he says, apparently without being aware of the pertinence to his own work, ""[a] smart woman should always be on guard against bad relationship advice, especially from men."" To which I can only add, amen!"
4,Learning How To Think Like a Fish,"I found the information in the book to be very helpful in understanding the natural need for men(fish) to feel like they are chasing a woman. I found the Seven Emotional Hungers to be an outstanding tool for hooking fish. I read the book so fast the first time, that I had to read it again to really have the analogy of angling and luring a man sink deeply into my mind. It's amazing to me how many women say they want to catch the big fish, but refuse to heighten their skills to become expert anglers. ""Men Are Like Fish"" is a great tool for increasing anyone's game."
3,"fewer fishy quotations, more practical advice needed","This book is packed with cute little quotes and proverbs, some related to fishing. While this is cute, I was looking for more specific pearls of wisdom. Everyone knows if you start a conversation with a man and fumble it or appear awkward, you probably aren't going to get anywhere with said man. I would like to have seen some more ""Do's"" and specific good start examples vs. ""Don'ts"".I found Dr.Nancy Fagan's book ""Desirable Men: How to Find Them"" much more helpful!"
4,Gleam What You Can....,"From this book and put the ""bait"" on the hook!Author Of:Black Women Deserve Better"
3,Fun summer read but too simplistic to take seriously,"I had fun reading this book, but keep in mind that it's a short book that keeps repeating the Men are Like Fish analogy over and over. I found some of the advice about looking good, wearing skirts and dressing in pastel colors, a throwback to the 50s when women were taught how to land a husband! It is true that men will respond to a lady dressed up in a short skirt and high heels, but is that your only goal in life? The book actually makes men sound like they have a brain the size of a fish's - they respond to a wiggling worm (sexy girl) who plays the line a little (plays hard to get). It's a little distressing if this is true. What about equality and getting to know each other as friends? Some of the back pages are very funny, but I don't think this is serious advice that you should listen to."
3,Fair,The fish analogies were too frequent and became annoying after awhile. Some of the info. was ok but I got a lot more out of the book 'Date Like A Man' - It is an excellent book.
5,Catch the bigger fish!,"Excellent book! I recommend reading this book to all women that are looking to catch a fine, great man (or the biggest fish, to say)! Steven's suggestions make sense for us women, and it's very clear and easy to see it from a man's point of view. This book gives you practical advice about catching a man and to be the most alluring, beautiful, natural you (no faking) and get any man you want really hooked. I truly enjoyed reading this book, it's fun and entertaining, Steven has a special sense of humor, don't miss it."
3,"Reader from Reading, PA","This book was just okay, did not teach me any new fishing tricks that I didn't already know about, okay well maybe a few I will admit.. ha!ha!...It just could not hold my interest, it could of been a little more informative I think anyway. Actually too too much about fishing lingo through-out the entire book, to the point I got a little tired of it..."
5,"""Eye Catching Reading""","The moment you pick up this zany, fun filled book, you are encouraged by the Author Steve Nakamoto to continue on & on reading each and every page. His personal experiences are interesting. The ""quotes"" are a wake-up call to read on because you will have a smile on your face knowing that this is a true guide on "" How To Catch a Man"" because they are like ""Fish"". This book makes a perfect give for a friend because there is something for everyone, either to try a technique or knowing that person can relate to the text. ""Men Are Like Fish"" truly is a helpful, humorous and down to earth or ""Under The Sea"" guide to catching Mr. Right, or even Mrs. Right."
3,MEN ARE LIKE FISH,FOR READERS WHO ENJOY ANYTHING LIGHT AND I DIDN'TFIND IT HELPFUL PERHAPS FOR THE YOUNG DATER.
4,good advise from a man's point of view,"I believe a lot of good relationship advise comes from men and this book is a great example of this believe. The author made very good use of the analogy between catching a good man and catching a big fish. This book is great for women who wants great long-lasting relationships leading to marraige. It definitely worths buying. However, there are two things I find annoying: 1) Excessive use of quotes which I couldn't care less, because a lot of them weren't intended for man-woman relationships originally. 2) very long introduction - 20+ pages into the book he's still saying ""you will find in this book..."""
4,A Great Metaphor! Interesting Man's Perspective!,"The salon that I go to had a copy of this book on display so I took a peek and was pleasantly surprised. As a regular reader of Cosmo, I get more than my share of monthly ""dating"" and ""relationship"" advice. This book is more of a conversation piece than strictly about advice. At first I wasn't too into the ""fishing"" metaphor, but as I got through the book I began to see how it all fits together. My friends and I are having a good time playing with this thing. I hope others will see how different this book really is."
1,YUK,"This is the worst book on the subject that I have read. It is not written well - or even easy to read for that matter and with advice like have good skin, have a pleasant voice and don't have an opinion that is contradictory to your date's, Nakamoto's book is shallow and unhelpful. Other books on the subject like He's Just Not That Into You are much more realistic, empowering and helpful."
4,Men Are Like Fish,A delightful book written with honest acuity. Steve Nakamoto doesn't take pages to say what can be said in a few lines. Some of his thoughts on relationships may be something you think you already know but he puts it in a way you won't soon forget. This is a book you will want to share with your friends.
2,cliff notes from multiple relationship books,"Not a good book. The book is essentially quotes from multiple relationship books. He never does give great advice, well no advice that we haven't read from other relationship books. Read the authors biography and you'll see he's not even a relationship expert."
2,Not worth more than $5.00,"In all honesty, this book isn't worth it. The author basically advises that it's best to ""not lack"" in any area of your life to attract the most desirable men. And after the first couple of pages, the constant fishing analogies begins to wear more than a little thin. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."
1,Not funny or insightful,"I was hoping this book would be entertaining and/or insightful, but was very disappointed. The advice and humor is very simplistic. ""The Boyfriend Test"" by Wendy Walsh is a much more helpful book at men and dating."
5,This book was extremely valuable in learning about men!,"I loved this book!!! Not only was it filled with thousands of very important pieces of information to help us as women to see men in a more positive and understandable way, it was also fun and easy to read! It has changed the way I perceive men and how I relate to them in a very positive way!!!"
4,outcome of the wiseone,"This album lacks content, but the beat is definitely something to dance to. I would recommend this album to friends as far as a party album, but something to vibe to in the car, I would have to say Naaa."
5,Great cases and really useful for ABSITE & written boards,"There were many questions and points from this book directly on the written boards and many from last year's ABSITE. It seems to capture the recurring questions. I would highly recommend this to any surgical resident, specially since it's a good study guide to Cameron's book."
2,Many errors,"I purchased this book before the most recent review prior to mine appeared. After using the text, I have to agree with that user...it simply has too many errors to make it useful as a review book for someone reviewing for the ABSITE or General Surgery Boards. While it may be appropriate and useful for the student to review for his/her Surgery Shelf exam, I wouldn't trust it for the more senior exams.Frankly, too many of these review books have sloppy editing and incorrect answers to make me feel comfortable recommending many of them. I understand that there is a large and profitable market for such books, but the authors putting these things out should feel embarassed to produce such sloppy work."
3,Average,"Quick and easy to read. However, many topics are too general. Others have too much unimportant (too verbose) information. Can theoretically read cover to cover in a week or so. A decent ABSITE prep."
2,for looking only,"I was very excited when I got this,because it looks so beautiful. I love good coffee and I wanted to replace aluminum espresso maker with stainless steel. It was more difficult to operate and seal leaked! Espresso taste was mediocre. I was really dissapointed that functionality did not follow design."
3,Dissapointed faithful reader of the series,"I love the bathroom reader series, and the content of this book is mostly up to their usual standards, but I have to agree with the last reviewer. Uses large text, wide margins, and half empty pages to get the page number so high. Could have easily fit into less than 100 pages.Funny, but not worth it for the money."
5,Hysterically funny book from Uncle John,"This isn't your usual bathroom reader. Instead of the usual mix of short, medium, and long articles, these are all short -- two pages at most. But those pages are used very effectively. Check out the Dumb Movie Festival entries: each includes a page of plot and a fun fact, then a page of quotes from the critics. There's also the very stupid quiz: can you spot the real stupid story, or will you choose the made-up ringer? And more tips for stupid criminals. A great addition to our bathroom library."
3,Great Pot - Misadvertised Purchase,"I purchased 4 - 12 packs of these cute little pots for a shower I was hosting. After I received only 4 pots, I contacted Ace and inquired about my missing pots. Apparently, the ad was written incorrectly and should not have said '12 pack' on the listing. Ace would not send me the additional pots unless I wanted to pay the price for each one (rather than a set).The pots are great! They do have a number of small holes around the bottom of the pot."
3,WHERE ARE THE BLAST BEATS,"I dont understand how people can say this is Bolt Throwers best release. The vocals are not that great and some of the riffs are downright boring. Dont get me wrong, there are some good songs, however, this album doesn't come close to their previous albums.What the hell happened to the blast beats ?"
4,A good debut,"This conspiracy/paranoia novel is lifted above the usual schlock by the bright, focused writing of this first-time author. Vivid characters and well-paced plotting make a Big Government/Big Corporation plan to control the populace believable all the way to the end."
2,One of his best to date,"This is holly's best work since his acclaimed short story, ""Bountiful Beth: A Short History of Antarctic Beaver Trapping"". In each work, Holiday blends his grasp of historical facts with the feverish, jerking rhythm of adventure. Hally's attention to detail is as solid as the pen is in his hand. You actually feel like you are inside the novel and participating in one of its numerous car chase scenes. The action is so real and so suspenseful that during one of the crash scenes, Hoply ejaculates you from the vehicle and leaves you dashed and spluttered against a wall. I eagerly anticipate his next work."
1,"Superficial, poorly written","He lifted and X-file script and re-packaged it in flat dull prose. Not good, not bad, just sort of there...like mucus.Seignior Holly, I challenge you to write a decent novel. Can you do it? Do you have it in you? Can you do it? And by the way, what's up with that web site of yours. I never knewso much egotism could be rendered in HTML. I love me. I love me not. I love me. I love me not. I love me. I love me. I love me. I love me."
1,And then some......,"Nora Holly's a cool writer, but they gave her a totally bad subject to do. I know that she's never written a book about tall dudes before, 'cept that basketball diaries book. I kinda liked that. I kinda like thought this was gonna be about that too, cause it had a homey name character Linus. I was down for the read then I read more of it and there was no tall men, no basketball, nothing. I mean like I know that she knows her roundball from all the other stuff I read a hers. But i didn't even like this as much as his last book. If I wus talkin' to him right now I'd say, ""hey like sports writer, put out another book about hoops.......call it Take it to the Hole."" I'm just sayin' she needs to stick to what she knows....cause she writes the best sports column and books too."
2,Firrst semester grades,"I give this book an A for effort. Writing is very difficult work. Writing for a living can be one of the most difficult and discouraging enterprises. I salute anyone, even the mediocre for giving it a shot.I give this book a C for content. There is nothing creative in the conspiracy theories contained in this book. They serve no instructional purpose and in terms of entertainment, we've all seen them before in various episodes of the X-files.I give this book a C for style. The writing has been described as hip, witty and entertaining. Maybe I'm a bit jaded, but to me it bears the stamp of another young person who really likes himself but whose prose is unremarkable.Final grade C+. Mr. Hawley, your grade at the end of the course will be based on improvement. You have every opportunity to get an A in the course. But to accomplish this, you must produce a meaningful story in genuinely interesting language. Come see me during my office hours if you have an questions."
1,This does not bust any genre!,"I wish Mr. Hawley knew his characters better so when he wrote their dialogue, the reader would know who's speaking. Strange and awkward metaphors and similes. I had hoped for an intelligent thriller--I read an unintelligible one."
2,A conspiracy is going all right,"An interesting intro sucks you in, leads you page by page but in the end you realize you haven't traveled anywhere. And three days after finishing it, I still don't know what tall men had to do with the story.Plus, the author tries to prove what a good writer he is over and over again. He is a good writer, he just needs to work on creating plots that start with a mystery to draw us in and finish with conclusions that actually conclude something."
2,That annoying little tic,"If you're accustomed to reading decent literature and if you like well written thrillers, then this book will irritate you a little. As you go through the canned, predictable plot, you can picture the author loving his ideas as they popped out of his head. Then you start to actually analyze the prose in terms of what is childish, what is copied from others and how much of it is canned, late 20th Century ""crap"". If the book were merely bad, I would have no problem with it. Unforunately, it's just good enough to make you realize why it can never be a good book. Although I've never met Mr. Holly, I suspect he is sadly a product of his culture. Television, television and more television."
1,There are unfavorable omens in the sky,"I didn't really like it. It seemed amateurish and similar to a lot of other stuff that's out there. I guess that I also dont't like the industry's evaluation of what consitutes 'great literature'. Pretty soon, every adolescent will be writing his minum opus and every reviewer will be telling us how great and innovative it is even though its the same old shtick. I wonder why so many hacks are attracted to the literary profession?"
5,What It Is Like Inside A Conspiracy Theorist's Head During a Caffeine Buzz,"You know when you drink a lot of coffee, and the synapses start firing real fast, and you start to get so many ideas that you can't hold them all together? That is what reading this book is like. It induces an artificial state of apophenia.The author gives you just enough atmosphere and detail to keep you fascinated, without getting bogged down. And his prose is excellent. There is a paragraph-long sentence at the end of the chapter on page 51 of the paperback edition that continues to blow me away.A fun read. Probably my favorite novel."
4,"well written, well plotted","For once, a thriller that does not insult my intelligence. The plot is good, but even better, the writing is clever and observant, and has a lot ot jokes in it. Treats the whole subject of conspiracy nuts as perfectly rational and follows perfectly from there."
5,Awesome!!!,"I can't help it. I love it. This is by far one of the best remix albums I've ever heard. It's not as metal sounding as a full length Eisbrecher album, but the electronic/ebm mixes are done so well that I can't help myself but confess that it's a five star effort."
1,Awful !,"i got these in the mail the other day and they are horrible. it is like they took Pink slime and seasoned it and piped it into thin plastic.i am very disappointed :-(. these are a step above a dog treat. i hate to leave a negative review, but 30+ dollars with shipping. I brought this bag into work and put them in my Drivers room......they are still there. usually ANY food left on there table is gone. \http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYVKRS/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,Sour and mushy,"I finally received my order of buffalo bills hot shot Hot flavor 2.1 lbs. I bought this because of all the review. My first thought about the taste of this beef stick is that it tasted really sour and i tasted some spices but it was far from hot,it wasn't even hot at all. Its easy to chew probably because it tasted too mushy and soft. The reason why i gave it a 2 star instead of 1 star is because it's was going for a good price. Overall, I wouldn't buy this beef stick because it taste mushy and sour, I'm sure it's not expired because it says feb 2013. I knew i should've gotten the peperoni flavor beef sticks. Also, from all the other people's review i was expecting a sample from them since i read a lot of people received samples. I was kinda disappointed. So i won't be buying the hot shots again and its not because i didn't receieve a sample. haha"
4,Sick of them.,I've eaten about 1/3 of them and now they just make me feel sick.They taste good and I love the pop when you break the casing biting into the sticks.I'm going to have to re-seal the rest though. No way I can go through 2 lbs of that before they start going bad. :\
2,Not a Slim Jims Replacement,"While the cost on this item is sure to bring attention, I found the taste to be a little bland while the product was dryer then I am used to with jerky of this type. Please note this is for the ""Hot"" version of this product (there are three flavors and I have not tried the other two so your millage may very on the other flavors) Shipment was fast and packaging was A1. Perhaps I'll give the other flavors a try."
2,Quality issues,The pepperoni sticks tasted the same as the original mild sticks. The package was labelled 'pepperoni' but definitely did not taste like pepperoni. I'm not sure if this was a simple isolated mix up but I won't be purchasing more of this brand.
3,just like a slim jim,"So these were just ok, kinda spicy. tasted like a processed slim jim. Not sure i would get again. good bang for the buck i guess."
4,Good kinda expensive,Good jerky sticks came quick but no complaints jerky sticks are always good especially on breaks at work thank u
2,Mostly tastes of beef heart,"I've had several brands of beef sticks and am not a very picky eater, so was surprised that there was a pretty big discrepancy between how this product was reviewed here and how it tasted. To me it tasted more like beef heart than beef (and I have actually sampled beef heart before, so I know what it tastes like! Not something I would buy); the skin provided some resistance but then it was very mushy on the inside. Maybe my batch had a higher proportion of that than normal? I got the hot flavor, but that did not mask the weirdness of the taste.The reason for two stars instead of one: I brought it with us while we were camping, and we were a little short on food. The short sticks provided sustenance even if we all grumbled a little bit about the taste. They didn't cause any diarrhea or stomach problems.Unlike other people I did not receive any samples from Buffalo Bills and so have no input with regards to how their other stuff tastes."
1,thick-skin mush,"thick skin has more substance than the mush inside; called pepperoni but who knows why; so maybe try cut up in soup as last chance, or just for the animals"
3,They're ok,"I love jerky, and try most new brands I come across. Now and then I get a yen for beef sticks too, and here we are...Good points-- I agree that these are much less greasy than Slim Jims. The consistency of the filler is also much better.They came very quickly.Not so good points-- One review described them as 'spicy'. To me, 'spicy' adds twang while you're chewing. 'Hot' hangs around in your mouth after you've swallowed. These are 'hot'. They're not blisteringly hot; I'd go for maybe 4 or 5 on a 10 scale, but I wanted 'spicy' not 'hot'.They mostly just taste like some, uh... unique kind of liquid smoke. They almost taste like meat, but not quite.They're ok. I don't hate 'em, but doubt I'll repeat this particular experiment."
1,"Neither spicy (hot or otherwise), nor beefy or meaty (in traditional sense)","This product is NOT beef jerky or anything remotely like it. This product is neither spicy, nor beefy or meaty.What this product amounts to is a sour, salty, mushy, meat-based concoction pressed into stick form.And the ingredients*, to whom it may concern, are troubling to say the least.I'm currently inquiring in my social network about anyone with a dog who should like to have it. ('Who' may refer to the dog as well.)*Ingredients: Beef, Beef Hearts, Water, Soy Protein Concentrate, Salt, Dextrose, Spices, Corn Syrup, Smoke Flavoring, Paprika, Monosodium Glutamate, Flavoring, Sodium Erythorbate, Lactic Acid Starter Culture, Sodium Nitrite. (Appetizing, ahem.)"
1,these things are horrible,ive eaten jerky products for over 45yrs and even made my own. Most of these types of jerky or links arent made of quality cuts of meat this is certainly one of them Heart lungs etc. and at the price your paying thats unacceptable let them put it in there listing what ingredients are in it and see how that works for them
1,INGREDIENTS:,"What they don't tell you: The first three ingredients are: Beef, Beef Hearts, Water. They also include Monosoldium glutamate (MSG) and corn syrup. I wish I had known what was in these."
5,great jerkey,"They taste great, its the only way my and my shop can get fresh jerky out here in Afghanistan. Recieved the package promptly for my area and everything was fresh and un-damaged."
2,JMarshall,The delivery was quick and the package arrived without issue. The reason for the 2 stars is because i wasnt satisfied with the Flavor . I just dont have a taste for it. so now i have 2 pounds of meat sticks that im not going to eat. the company did send a sample of its barbecue beef jerky which was really nice. next time i will have to order that. you win some and you lose some. it happens.
2,kinda not good,"had kind of a chemically taste, like cleanser.. maybe the extruder hadn't been rinsed well..? preservative? probably would have been tasty otherwise..."
3,They're okay,"Such a large packaging means you have to eat these fast. Flavor wise, it's okay, but kind of salty. Texture wise, nice and snappy on the outside but mushy in the middle."
2,Wrong product shipped,"I ordered the mild sticks about 1 month ago an loved them. They were better than slim Jim's. Better flavor, less greasy. So I was running out and ordered more MILD sticks. I got the hot ones. These lack the snap of the mild so are less satisfying. The spice was nice, but still I want my mild sticks."
1,unpleasant,"These are not really that good. They have like twenty or so ingredients but none add anything close to flavor. imo buy something else, also its 2 lb's so once bag is open have to store it in something else unless you eat it all at once and that would be unlikely with the before mentioned taste."
3,"Taste is passable, they have other products that are better.","I give the company high marks! The product arrived quickly, and I very much appreciate the 'gift' package of free 'Honey' Jerky' included. The package was small, but delicious. That in itself prevents me from going below 3 stars. I took off a star because the Hot Shorts are not even close to being 'mild', and far off from being 'hot'. Another star because the taste is...just passable.I don't plan on ordering these specific 'Buffalo Bills Hot(?) Shorts' again, but I do plan on ordering other products of theirs. I am a 'subscribe & save' customer here on Amazon and have a couple of other 'Jerky' subscriptions that I'll end up cancelling and then changing to other offers once I find better replacements."
4,Just as good as K&N!!!,"You can't beat the price! At 9 bucks this filter is well worth the price. The first one i got was damaged but amazon immediately sent a replacment and even paid for the return of the bad one. The only bad thing is that fram doesn't make this filter any longer so the cleaning kit is not available but I'm sure the K&N kit does the same thing. If not, it was cheap enough, I'll throw it out and buy another."
4,A clever soundtrack,"Not only is it a soundtrack but it also passes as a good album! I wasn't really fan of the show but a friend recommended the soundtracks to me and this was the first I bought, I plan on buying the others."
2,laying on of stones?,"A bit of a dissapoinment, though some of the grids look interesting and a couple i have tryed were effective, i felt detailed information on the grids/layous was lacking.I was really after a more practical book that showed layouts practical for using on a client on a healing bed...you would need plenty of space to do these layouts/grids properly. If any one has a recomendation on such a book I would love to hear from you!"
2,Disappointing,"Love Is in the Earth: Laying on of Stones (Crystals and New Age)I purchased this book on the strength of the first Love Is in the Earth -- a very detailed compendium of scientific and metaphysical information. Sadly, there's really no comparison between Laying on of Stones and it's predecessor. As a student of Reiki, I had hoped for a book that gave detailed, practical advice regarding which crystals to use for certain conditions and the proper placement of crystals during a healing session. This simply is not that book. The suggestions that are given for crystal placement involve a great many crystals -- far more than most of us have in our collections. Frankly, I'd like to return this book, but the shipping costs and aggravation involved don't seem worth it."
2,"A Magnificent Exhibit, but a mediocre Book","The exhibit of Ernst's work, which is still running at the Metropolitan Museum is a stunning tribute to an artist whose styles have influenced so many others over the course of the twentieth century. His style shifted and evolved so much over time that it is hard to believe the same artist that painted ""Saint Cecilia"" also painted ""The Kiss"" and ""The Robing of the Bride."" Unfortunately, the poor quality of the prints in the museum's book makes it a big disappointment, especially at this price. The text is alright, but the colors in the prints are radically darker and different in tone and do no justice to the original works."
2,Ditto on the quality of the reproductions,"I just saw the retrospective a couple of weeks ago as well and agree with the other reviewers: the exhibition is great, but the quality of the plates in the catalog is miserable."
5,great quality,great quality and i got it pretty quickly. definitely a good buy. would say that it was pretty large but did the job
2,nothing amazing!,I was looking for an amazing nipper from the reviews i read and this is a far cry from that! I doesnt get right up under the ingrown nail like i was expecting only the sides are easy to cut out which i can do with any ordinary nippers if the jaws are long enough!
3,OK clipper,"Nice quality and does the job. However, I would not necessarily use it on an in-grown toe nail. Tip is very sharp and may cut int the toe."
1,Not a very good cable,I paid a couple dollars for the cable but the cable does not stay in the phone very well. I would recommend buying a different brand. It is worth the extra dollars.
1,Terrible,Doesn't work... It works as an antenna and that's about it.. I could carry around a cable for an antenna so I could listen to the radio.. Or not.. The only usable thing out of this purchase is the spare rubbers it came with... Don't bother buying this unless you want to buy the ear rubbers... the headphones work but sound like crap and are WAY too short.. You'd have to carry your ipod in your mouth to make these phones reach your ears... I hope this did a good job of telling you how terrible this buy is.. Look elsewhere... I'm happy I got the ear rubbers... for a higher price but.. You might not be...
5,Excellent Value,"The target audience of this book is people who want to know how to estimate annuities, life insuarance premiums etc. If you are sitting the actuarial exam(SOA) 2 this is what you need for the Theory of Interest part. It also covers parts of exam 3. The book is affordable and way better than any other else. The methodology is crystal clear."
4,Very good modern jazz,"Lan Xang, as you would expect with Binney and McCaslin, are very modern in that the compositions are a big part of the songs. The CD starts off with one of the ""Lan Xang"" interludes, which are the weakest parts of the CD. Most jazz CD interludes are merely a distraction (if it's a great idea, make it a short song), unfortunately these interludes are no exception. ""Day Of Fear"" is good, then ""Vevasis"" and ""Far Rockaway"" aren't quite as good. From there on, the four remaining proper songs on the CD are very good. At times sounding like Vandermark-goes-to-New Orleans (""2nd Line Sally""), they eventually go to Seattle (""Grunge Factor""). ""Bob Dole"" is another interlude. This is a good 4-star CD; perhaps if McCaslin played like he's currently playing with Dave Douglas, and they hadn't put on the interludes, it'd get bumped up."
4,"""You Are Everything"" and the remixes are almost everything...","Vanessa covers The Stylistics hit ""You Are Everything"" well and it is different than the other covers of this song as this cover is almost upbeat and makes the listener want to snap their fingers along while listening to this track. It is a shame that Lava Records did not include the album/radio version of the song on the single, but that is one the two small missteps with this single. All of the remixes are excellent except the Ford remix as I don't think it fits Williams vocals too well. Otherwise the remixes are excellent as Junior Vasquez decides not too deviate too much from the original mid-tempo feel of the song and the Mr. Mig remix feels like it would be at home in a Mitsubishi car commercial (which is not a bad thing at all.)"
1,Poor image quality,"At the highest quality setting, camera only takes 24 pictures, not 187. Download often, because pictures are lost if batteries go out. Preview screen is so tiny it is hard to see what you are taking a picture of (or have just taken a picture of).Even at highest quality setting, image quality was extremely poor--grainy, distorted colors, blurry. Does not save images in jpeg format -- uses BMP format."
1,Eats batteries and Broken,"When I first got this camara. I thought ""not bad for $50"". It took me forever to get it to take a picture that wasnt too dark or too bright. I bought it so I could put pictures of my crafts online for my craft business. I took 3 or 4 pictures and had to change batteries (lost the pics in the process). Then, finally managed to get about a dozen pictures taken (had to put the item directly under the flourescent light over my stove to get the pictures to be halfway decent). When I went to use it again after about 3 weeks, the pictures had these weird lines. I emailed the company and they sent me a replacement but I really dont want it. Bottom like this camara was a waist of $50."
2,Battery Muncher!,"Bought this camera for our 5 year old. She loves it. But it does eat batteries. We use rechargables and she can take one set of pics on the internal memory (about 20 pics) and then we immediately download the pictures to the computer and change the batteries. Forget about trying to figure out how to use the flash or delete. Just use it to take pics outside in good light and delete them after you download them. We just ordered an SD card, so we'll see how it works with that."
1,I know it's cheap--but ....big mistake,"Frankly, I bought this for my daughter because I was going broke paying for pictures of people's feet, or unidentifiable buildings, or no heads. She's 8 yrs old. Unfortunatly, it is just too hard to work. It is hard to take pictures, it's hard to find them again, and as i read some of the other comments, I guess we have lost our un-downloaded pictures, because I know I havent changed the batteries in months! Either get a nicer one in the same price range without the viewer, or be diligent in taking back pictures that you dont like with 35mm or 110 film."
1,worst jfk book ever? yep,This book is terrible. It is sooooooo full of lies and distortions. not even good for toilet paper.
5,An adorable book,"This is an adorable book! Well written, very cute. I bought several for my pre-teen nieces, but I thoroughly enjoyed them before sending them on. Definitely recommend."
5,Good Memories,"Once in a while I find a DVD on Amazon that brings back good memories, this film is one of them. I have seen it in a movie theatre in Germany ages ago, and looking forward to seeing it again. Please keep bringing those oldie's german movies.hep 44"
2,Disappointing,"I initially bought this book because I was impressed with another ""Very short introduction"" entitled ""The Koran"" by Michael Cook. I thought that ""Islam"" would be as good, but I was disappointed. Instead of a thoughtful and insightful book, I found ""Islam"" to be a hodgepodge collection of facts, opinions and speculation that brought me no closer to understanding Islam than I had been before. Ruthven is best in the brief sections when he sticks to comparing religions (which is apparently what he does for a living). However, the author seems to misunderstand many aspects of Islam, and makes several significant factual errors- the greatest of these perhaps is the assertion of the widespread influence of Sufism on Islam and the Muslim world as a whole. If you are thinking of buying this book in order to get an understanding of Islam, forget it. Buy ""The Koran"" instead, and you will get a much better understanding (and book) at the same price."
2,Not a useful introduction to the subject,"Like other reviewers, I bought this to get the basics of the history, beliefs, and practices of Islam -- I figured the title would mean the book would provide those things. I was wrong. The author spends more time discussing Islam than informing the reader about it. Imagine being an undergrad listening in on the conversation of a few post-doc students who already knew that one another knew the basics, and then some...this is the book you'd write from that. It should have been titled ""A Very Short Discussion of the Politics and Historiography of Islam"" -- hardly something for beginners. I think I'll go buy a Dummies guide."
3,worth the read but dated,"I have traveled to Turkey and Pakistan. I wanted to understand more about Islam. This book was recommended to me and available locally. I learned a lot and am happy I read the book.However, the book was reissued in 2000. Its conclusions sound more like wishful thinking given 9/11 and subsequent world events."
1,GARBAGE,"PLEASE if your interested in learning about ISLAM the religion then looking it up on the web is much more usefull and truthfull than this garbage. you will not be introduced to anything in this short introduction, except the same ani-islamic propaganda that is abundant every were around you."
3,meh,"its annoying after a wile to hold this on your back if your a more physical player who will dive or roll around. i often find myself removing it mid game so that i can feel a bit more free when sneaking around, it may not be worth the hassle"
2,It's too narrow.,"Thinking I can save some $ on my electric bill by not using my electric dryer during hot summer months, I bought it just for that purpose. But I had no idea that 14 1/2 inches wide is way too narrow to hang a regular pair of jeans or a full size bath towel. I can fold the jeans or bath towels over to hang them, but isn't that defeating the purpose? Buy it if you are only going to dry smaller stuff like kitchen/hand/wash towels or intimate stuff that you normally need to hang dry. Otherwise, it is just a waste of $."
2,polder 8316-90,"Sturdy, but much narrower than expected. The small size makes it virtually useless. For example, a t-shirt barely fits. Only good if you're drying sock or lingerie."
3,Know just enough to make yourself look stupid.,"While this is a well meaning book, it will just give you enough information to make you look like a hillbillly from Tennessee. It is put together nicely, it is glossy, but I consider it far short of any kind of help in an every day situation."
4,Where's Muftak,"If you don't have these figures already, they're great for a cantina scene. However, I got Kabe years ago when he was released with Muftak. Muftak & Kabe is a better set - after all, they're partners in crime. I'm disappointed to see that Muftak isn't still around (but relieved to know I got him)."
1,NEVER RECIEVED MY GULLAH MUSIC,"I WOULD LIKE TO WRITE A REVIEW, BUT I NEVER RECIEVED MY CD. I PAID FOR IT WITH MY MASTERCARD. EVERY TIME I WOULD CHECK FOR IT IN 'WHERE'S MY STUFF' THE EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE WOULD CHANGE. NOW WHEN I CHECK FOR IT, I CAN'T FIND IT IN NONE OF MY ORDERS. IT WAS ORDER BACK ON OCTOBER 3, 2002. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPEN TO IT OR TO MY MONEY. PLEASE E-MAIL ME WITH A RESPONSE."
1,Stevens and God,"Charles M. Murphy has little understanding of Wallace Stevens man or poet. Stevens believed in a ""spiritual universe without a godhead."" He was, above all, an aesthete who felt that poetry must give pleasure. In fact, he was as anti religion as they come. When I saw that the Paulist Fathers published this book, and the blurbs in the back, I was immediately suspicious. I happened to be a student of Samuel French Morse, one of the foremost critics on Stevens. So even though I have this book, I refuse to read it. I will stick with the handful of great poems that Stevens wrote."
1,Misleading Product information - NOT MANUFACTURED BY HP,"Purchased this product, it is an HP-Compatible product. It seems to work fine, however the listing is very misleading. The product picture, and listed manufacturer are HP, it uses a product number very close to the HP product number, but it is not an HP product. It is a knock-off part.I guess I should have expected it since the other HP parts were double the price."
3,5 Star Love Story But 3 Stars Because Of A Messed Up Page!,I read this book and I think it was a delightful read and I really liked Luke and Fleur and found the love story so delightful that I just couldn't put the book down and I think the book is a keeper though I would like to find another copy because the one I have has a defective page where the words are all faded or missing and looks like the results of a printing error and I'm hoping that it's just this copy and that every single copy of this book doesn't have a page with defective print but anyway defective page or not I still loved reading this book! This is a very good book and I would have given it 5 stars but the messed up page at a very crucial moment makes me give it 3 stars instead!
2,Tiny Cups,If this thing makes four cups of espresso then I'll have to use the dollhouse size cups. There's no way it makes four espresso cups of coffee and my espresso cups were all purchased in Italy. But its really pretty sitting on the stove.
3,"pretty, simple, & feminine","The pearls in this necklace vary from white, to pink, to peach, to beige. It is not nearly as pink as I hoped it'd be, but the upside is that the color range is so neutral you'll be able to wear it with anything. I don't really care for the clear fish-line that makes up the string of this necklace. What I do like though, is the fact that the stones are woven on in a way that makes them quite 3D....some stand up and some lean down, and you get a lot of movement in it as you go about your activities. So it does have an artful appeal even if the design is a bit simple. Since I think it's quite a bit more interesting than the usual plain strand of pearls, it'll make a nice addition to my necklace wardrobe. Just be aware that this is more of a subtle piece and not a ""knock-out"" design."
4,Allison: A cautionary tale,"We've read this book many times because my three year old daughter, who left China one year ago, is fascinated by Allison and her doll, Mei Mei, and because we're both drawn to Allen Say's illustrations, which so perfectly capture Allison's emotions. I wondered why Allison's parents had shared so little not only of her country of origin, which is never mentioned, but also about Allison's adoption in particular and adoption in general. Perhaps the real message of this book is to adults who think children can ""wait until they're older"" to hear their personal stories of adoption."
1,Skip This Horribly Offensive Book,"As an adoptive parent of an Asian child (who we named Allison), I picked up this book anticipating a special connection. My 17 year old daughter read it first and agreed that we shouldn't show it to our Allison. None of this book makes sense for the age of the child or the situation. The illustrations are indeed beautiful but they are wasted on an ill written and poorly researched topic."
1,Poor,I found this book offensive in the extreme. If I were an adopted child I would certainly not wish to be compared to a stray cat taken in off the street. I have found a lot of quality books about adoption. This one should be given a miss.
4,Good Excerise,I enjoy this ab bench. It does what I thought it should do. I use this 3 times a week and I love it.
4,Older folks can use this too,"This is not just a he-man machine.As a woman over 60, this bench is one of the few ab machines that can use and find toleratble. The problem I have is that I cannot do situps due to the ""grunt"" effect on my heart rhythm. But with this bench, I can adjust the weight to a level that I can tolerate, and increase the reps to make up for less weight.It's nice to sit and do this while you watch TV, also...you can knock off 30 mins on this thing without even noticing it.I would note that I found the straps going across my shoulders to be somewhat uncomfortable. So I put a padded broomstick through the handholds and lay my arms on top of the stick, which makes it quite comfortable.The pulley is very smooth, and the backrest has a nice lumbar curve in it that I find very restful for stretching my back--really helps the stiffness in my spine and gets me straightened out again."
3,You Get what you Pay For,"For around $100 you can't expect the kind of smooth, frictionless experience of a gym quality abdominal machine. At this price point, the PAB21X does fill a niche in one's training arsenal and you can get a decent abdominal workout on this rig. The plastic tube covering the steel cable ripped off in less than a week (no real impact to the functionality of the machine) but otherwise its held-up ok to 3-4x weekly usage thus far.Not the best ab machine available, but a decent rig for the money."
2,Missing assembly bolts and nuts!,"The quick delivery is highly appreciated, however some essential hardware parts are missing.On the Owners Manual page #6, none of the bolts, washers, spring washers, nylon lock nut, have been supplied complete. The available ones numbers don't match the manual description, and they look like prepared for a different equipment - not the AB Bench. Their sizes are not similar.On the other hand, the harness, steel cable, pulley, end caps as well as the spring snap links are all there.Please, help me out in getting the bench put together ASAP as it's a gift."
1,Terrible!,"Installation was easy but the single screw holding the wheel to roll the weight up and down is too big. The lumbar padding is too thick that it causes back pain. The little end piece to hold your weights is TOO short.Luckily I had a bench from an old home gym I had lying around which I rigged to attach. I also found a screw that fitted the wheel so the machine is now usable. If it weren't for those modifications, I would return it in an instance.Do not buy it unless you're willing to fix it to make it usable!"
2,Unplugged: Way Church Used to be!,"If you are merely looking for showmanship, then this DVD is for you. However nothing about the entire DVD performance reminded me of anything as -the title would suggest- ""The way church use to be""! Dillard and choir spent too much time perfecting facial, and precise movements then they did to the deliverance of each song. At times several of the selections were painful to listen too as they were screaming - resulting in the song becoming inaudible! I give it 2 stars - simply for its effort!"
2,POOR,"The book waw wraped in the corner and had a black line drawned in all the pages at the bottom which is very bad, specially for comic collectors"
3,"Not enough crunch, can get monotonous.","Hearing Max Cavalera's project with Alex Newport convinced me to buy this. Sadly it just didn't come up to par with Nailbomb, the live sound may be partly to blame as all the songs sound vague and mushy. The songs are also extended beyond the margin of interest which compounds with the live sound to form an amorphous stew of sameness. If you have not already got it, buy Nailbomb's ""Point Blank"" this is a wicked album which fully showcases Max & Alex' talents. (""In a Word""'s redeeming factor is the song ""Grey"" though whether this justifies the cost...)"

5,Humorous account of an American in China,"This is a poignant account of Froning's year of teaching English to Chinese university students. I liked it for its humor, but also because I got to know what appears to be an extraordinary man. I learned a lot about society in current China through his descriptions of various encounters with the system and everyday people. I loved how he included his students in the book; his descriptions were so vivid, you felt you got to know them. This is truly a remarkable book; I found I couldn't put it down once I started reading."
5,Excellent book - couldn't put it down!,"Minette Walters just keeps getting better and better! I highly recommend this book to both Walters fans, and those new to her work.No need to describe the plot of this book - its been so admirably done already. Unlike so many authors, her novels are stand alone rather than series book. And also unlike so many authors, as her popularity grows she just doesn't repeat her plots, nor seem to be selling out or ""phoning it in"". Yes, the ending is a tad trite - but only just a tad, and thank heavens since the rest of the book is anything but. More of a psychological roller coaster.Excellent stuff, and hopefully there'll be more of it very soon."

2,More for new family historians,"This is an informative book but contains information that might be needed by new family historians, rather than those who have been exploring for more than a couple of years."
3,Walking with your ancestors,"As I enjoy genealogy, it is very enjoyable. The only problem for me is that when you are not searching in the USA, then we know it is similar but not ours. The book is well put together and gives us another path to follow when searching for family."
5,Very tasty candy.,My mother grew up with Quality Street candy in the 1950's in England. I've always been partial to Quality Street chocolate over American chocolate. I took this tin of candy in to the office and it lasted about 3 hours before it was all eaten.
4,Quality Street,"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter, so all I can say is that the item arrived safely and on time. She was very pleased."
2,Over priced and stale,I purchased this thinking it was a good deal at $30 for this huge tin only to walk into my local candy shop to find the same thing on the shelf for half price. The money is one thing but I was very upset when I gave this to my mom for her birthday and all that chocolates were stale.
1,Spoiled Candy,"The candy in this order was spoiled, a first for me. I've energized myself with tin after tin of my lovedQuality Street chocolates and toffees. But I had to throw out this entire order. And there was nopacking slip or return form included, so this is the first anyone at Amazon or at the supplier is hearingof the off-putting smell that rose out of that tin. Yuck."
1,Buyer beware!,"I was very excited to find the 1975 edition of this book that I remembered from childhood and ordered it. When it arrived, it was a 1990 edition with a completely different cover. Not what I wanted at all. Very misleading when you see 1975 as the published date and a picture of the 1975 edition. In fact, very deceptive! Lesson learned. I won't use this seller again (Jenson Online, Inc)!"
2,Wrong edition!!!,"I was looking for the edition that is pictured which is the same one I had as a kid, but I got a totally different one with a pink cover - it's a revised edition with some of the same recipes, and some different. The one recipe I wanted (wonderland pancakes) was totally changed. The only good thing is I only spent about $6 (with shipping costs) total cost, so not worth it to send back and I will try some of the other recipes. I really wish the seller would use the correct photo and information when advertising their products, as I was very disappointed that it wasn't the right book. The seller was ""internationalbooks."""
3,Average Fela Is Still Way Better Than The Best Of Britney Spears,"This is Fela at less than full strength. The 'perpetrators' of this CD have, and there are many examples of this, mislabelled the material: The first track is actually 'Dog Eat Dog', and the second track is 'No Agreement'. The clowns that put this CD together obviously didn't even bother to listen to what Fela was singing about. I'd look elsewhere frankly."
4,The handicapped have found a champion!,"As a person that doesn't read much romance, I got this book for pure escapism and found myself much intrigued. First, there were the ghostly, stereotypically Jewish mother matchmakers who might have made the book all by themselves had it not been for the novelty of the hero being an amputee. I don't believe I've EVER read a book where the romantic interest was an amputee. I was very impressed that Sara Jarrod would break the physical handicapped barrier by making it so. Good job, Ms. Jarrod!"
3,Return Home,"COMEBACK is not one of Dick Francis's best, but down a step from fantastic to different. When you write about a master who produces one great mystery after another, the downs are better than the writers in second place.Peter Darwin is a young British diplomat who stops off in Miami on his way home from Toyko. An improbable meeting with a nice couple who are on their way to London and enjoying a last night on the town set the stage for this strangely paced mystery.Vicky Larch and Greg Wayfield are on their way to Gloucester to attend Vicky's daughter's wedding. Peter's childhood home is Gloucester. This mystery/suspense novel takes you deep into the world of veterinary surgery with one of the strangest climaxes in the world of mystery/suspense.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."
4,Another winner,"You can't go wrong with a book by Dick Francis! Just a very enjoyable read with characters that are not only interesting, but who you'd like to know - or become."
1,Lousy!,"What a rip-off! This is just another compilation of people doing covers of other people's songs. This was not Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett at all. In fact, only tracks 4, 5 and 7 are the originals. Don't bother!"
1,Low price = low quality,"I can not blame amazon, I chose the cheapest option for a tile saw and receive exactly that, a cheap saw. The quality was sub standard. I am however proud of how quick amazon sent me the refund. I returned the item and the whole issue is settled now."
4,Great value,"Great value for small projects..Just finished bathroom tile floor and saw worked perfectly. You can,t go wrong for the price."
3,do not be mislead,"If you have the patients to fiddle and adjust a machine that is badly out of alignment and does not have any permenent way to fix the alignment trouble; the table is no where near square with the saw blade and on mine is off a full 1/4"" linerally; 5"" on the scale is actually 51/4"" from the saw, then you can cut tile neatly with a good blade. The blade runs without wobble and I have been cutting porcelain 18"" tiles with a blackwidow blade cleanly but every adjustment takes time. One reviewer has one of these machine that has an adjustment under the motor that aligns the blade, mines does not and it is only a few weeks old. I spent a lot of time trying to force the motor and hense the blade to run parallel with the table... no dice no matter what I tried. I would not recomend this to a friend BUT I bought if for $50.00 total plus the new blade and will stick with it for this small project ; about 25' of cutting."
4,Nice saw but may need tweaking before use,"Just received this saw today, really fast shipping from Amazon.I put it together right away and discovered a problem that at least 1 other commenter ran into, the blade was not in a straight line from front to back.Being a old school mechanic I decided to investigate why the blade was not lined up, I believe that the unit took a bump in shipping and because of this the weight of the motor bent the metal plate that the motor is attached to.To solve this I put quite a bit of hand pressure on the motor in the opposite direction of the misalignment (in this case I gently but forcefully pressed on the end of the motor pushing it towards the rear of the saw). It took a good bit of force but the blade did come into alignment and I then went on to lengthwise cut 9"" long by 1 1/4"" thick firebricks with great success. Once properly aligned the saw did a very nice job of cutting the firebrick with little effort."
1,You get what you pay for,"Lesson learned here. You get what you pay for. just put the unit together everything looked good and went smooth then i noticed the guide on the blade guard was off about 3/16 of inch, the blade is off set and there is no adjustment to square it up, so here are my choices, unit cost $49, shipping cost to send it back $26 Looks like i will have to take it apart shim the motor or grind the welds on the frame and retack. very dissapointed in the quality of this unit."
3,pretty good,"The water tray on this is a weakness. It cannot be removed without tipping (dumping water), and does not get the blade wet enough. When full, water splashes everywhere, then the level may be too low. I went through a blade quickly - I suspect the water system does not get the blade wet enough.update: The blade wear may be due to the fact that it is tough to align the guide, causing pinching. If I cut w/o the guide it is much smoother. I'm happier with it now and feel it is worth the price."
4,econo wet saw with decent blade,"I'm very happy with this unit. This was the first DYI tile project for me, 199sq feet of glazed ceramic 15"" tilefloor. The water splash is messy but the blade that came with the saw lasted for the whole job.I was impressed how straight my cut were and the sturdiness of the basic chassis. Please get this saw if you areon a budget and a second blade right away."
2,You get what you pay for - not much,"I didn't expect a lot but was disappointed nonetheless. First off I should say it does cut tile - which is what I required. BUT both the design and manufacturing leave a lot to be desired. You get what you pay for. My major gripe is that the motor housing is 5-7mm out of true with the table, and there is no way to adjust it. That means the fence is almost useless, unless one is making many repetitive cuts and can manually set the fence to insure orthogonality. You cannot just set up the fence on and expect it to be parallel with the blade. I'm not found of the blade guard either, and if it isn't perfectly adjusted your tile hangs on it while being cut. Oh, and no mention whatsoever in the instructions as to how to install the blade guard. Yes, I figured it out, but I shouldn't have had to. There were other minor things that led to my low rating as well, and at this juncture I really wish I'd spent an extra $25 for a better machine."
5,Good Picks for B & B's in Ontario,"If you want quality inns with no surprises, this book will guide you to some charming B & B's in Ontario. The writer has standards and the B & B's all live up to them. We have tried several of her recommendations and were never disappointed."
1,False Promises.,"After reading this book, I still cannot multiply food supplies, walk on water (unless it's frozen) nor can I turn water into wine. I'm not even going to try that resurrection bit. Sorely disappointed."
1,A Waste of Money,"Apparently in the interest of keeping things simple, Profozich trivializes the subject. There is not enough here for any reasonably responsible manager to evaluate the premise that simulations are effective ways to manage change (a premise with which I agree.) If you enjoy reading marketing material or going to motivational seminars this book may be what you are looking for. Otherwise, skip it."
5,"Surprise, surprise!","Well, I haven't had instant spuds since I was a kid (bout 25years now) and man have things improved. I don't know what the other guy's beef is, but these things are great for the price. Taste is spot on ""Loaded"" potato. Consistency is fluffy and the bacon bits were a nice touch. Gonna start stockpiling these babies."
3,Baked is sort of Half Baked,"I have enjoyed these products, however, the ""loaded baked potato"" just simply is not that at all. While the taste is good, there are almost no bacon bits, etc. I prefer other items that they make to this one."
2,Loaded Baked is overloaded with salt!,"The 'Loaded Baked' version too salty for me. I appreciate the cheese and bacon flavor but after 3 spoon fulls i had to throw it out. It tastes like those bacon and cheese potato chips from the vending machines. I also tried the 'Original Mashed Potatoes' version which is the exact oposite, had no flavor at all. The original version asks for milk, margarine, and salt. This loaded version only asked for water so that's a plus if you're camping or something. I'm still going to stock up on the Original version since it was .66 at my grocery store. But this version wasn't for me."
3,Not quite all that.,"I'm a big fan of the Idahoan instant mashed potatoes in all the various flavors and have rated them highly here on Amazon. However, the ""Loaded Baked"" flavor was my least favorite of the bunch. I couldn't really identify a particular flavor with the potatoes. They were supposed to taste like a baked potato with sour cream, cheese, bacon and chives, but I really couldn't identify any of those flavors when I was eating them. It was the artificial bacon bits that I found least appetizing. After the addition of boiling water, the soy protein masquerading as bacon turned into pinkish little chewy bits and the texture and taste I found disagreeable. I won't be ordering this flavor again."
5,Just bought these to get free shipping for the rest of my order,But both of these are fabulous! I will definitely try some of the other Canterbury Naturals products.
4,Informative book by an obvious master of the subject,"A valuable book, especially for beginning collectors like myself. Well written in a conversational style that welcomes the reader in. It's worth noting that, due to the author's own experience and background, the book focuses primarily upon artifact collecting in the Western U.S. and is therefore of maximum benefit for readers from that region."
1,Limited use for those in the East,"If you live out West, this will be be a fairly decent volume on arrowheads, however for those in the East, it has minimal value.I recommend buying the Overstreet guide"
4,Good Artifact Book,"This book by Mr. Yeager is easy to read and is well thought out. I use it frequently to identify different artifacts that I come across. However, I wish that the point identification chart used actual photo examples rather than line drawings as the drawings are hard to use for identification purposes. Overall a very good artifact book for those interested in surface collecting."
5,Great ring!,Just recieved mine today! Its very beautiful. It is a weighty ring though and the moonstone is a but smaller than I thought it would be but all in all it is a great buy.
3,Pretty ring... but meant for dainty fingers,I bought this ring because of the style... It is a pretty ring and seems well made. The only problem is it appears larger than it is. I was quite sad that the ring wasn't larger (the moons are not much wider than the band).I recommend this ring if you have 'dainty' fingers.
5,"Creative, dynamic, clever.","These guys are good. On a pure sound front they're pretty noisy with a lot of repetitive backing highlighted by a never ending assault of new sounds created by god knows what. Then they add chanting, multiple singers, crazy horns (basically a sort of jazzy wail that interrupts the lyrics from time to time) and a little bit of spoken word. Oh, and sometimes the album goes full jazz for about two minutes with just the horns and drums (violent emotional jazz at that). I think the word I'm looking for here is 'eclectic' and I mean that in an entirely positive way. Highly recommended to all true hipsters, retro mod femmes, and people who generally like good music. (and by the by, if you get the chance go see them live, they're out of San Diego and play fairly often around the area)"
5,This book is fun!,"Hello I am 8 years old. I like this book. It has lots of fun yoga for kids, and adults too! There's lots of yoga stories in the book which are really interesting. This book has lots of exercises you can do with partners too."
5,My 3 year old LOVES this,"This book is great! I like to do a lot of fun things with my kids and this book helps me to ""instruct"" the under 3 crowd in my house. The kids love it and everyone laughs when we do it! A definite must buy!"
5,Fly Like a Butterflly,Brilliantly photographed. The sheer joy of yoga shows on all of the little faces. I plan to use it as a teaching tool and hope my little yogis find joy in my classes.Namaste
2,Tend to break when crimped,"The metal part of the Connector seems to be of a softer grade of steel than some might be used to in the past, so be prepared to go through four destructive (of the Connector) crimps before getting something usable."
4,Spring Planting,We are using this book as part of a class to learn about finding our hearts desires and making them coming true. This book speaks to this and uses the analogy of a garden to talk about what we reap and sow and plan as intentions.
5,Mary shares her story and offers easy steps for one to take,"Mary Morrissey, head minister for Living Enrichment Center www.lecworld.org, speaks and writes about Truth. She walks her talk, which is refreshing. This book is well worth reading."
1,"Not even a good bad movie, just dumb.","I tried to watch this thing with an open mind, being a fan of cheesy movies in general, but in this one I found the ""bad"" humor forced and even the supposedly ""offensive"" material to be just tired, we just couldn't wait for the thing to end. The other reviewers might not agree with me, but do yourself a favor and rent the thing first. Personally I'd rather spend the time waiting in line at the DMV than watching this movie again."
3,Iron Didn't Fit in the Base,"I would give this product 5 starts in terms of quality.But, when I received it, my iron was too big to fit in the base. I just have a pretty normal iron that the cords winds up inside. I wish the description would have let me know to look out for this. If your iron base is more than 3.25"" deep from the iron side to the handle side, it probably won't fit."
2,Too Small,"Worked fine with older irons. With the newer irons, it's too narrow and they don't fit in the caddy."
2,Too small for my iron,"This is a great product if your iron fits in the casing! As it is, I am only using this product to hang my board."
5,"Great product, highly recommended","It's durable, efficient, fits my iron and the board perfectly. Perhaps the other reviewer should have checked the size of his or her iron first; it works just fine with mine which is a few years old; eliminates clutter, I have my iron with the cord and the board all at the same place. Easy to clean, too. It looks so neat and organized, I can't believe it. What would I do without Rubbermaid?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS POSTER!,"The poster I received looks as if it were printed at home from a low-resolution JPEG file with ""I WANT TO BELIEVE"" pasted over the image in Microsoft Publisher. Perhaps worse, I waited over two weeks for the poster to arrive after shelling out $3 for two-day shipping. A shoddy, falsely advertised product and substandard customer service make this seller and merchandise an all-around bad choice and waste of time. Search elsewhere for a real version of Mulder's preferred wall decoration--it'll be worth it."
3,You wouldn't waste much time by giving it a try,"This is a small book about children with strange gifts growing up in a strange world. I didn't think the world that the author created here was compelling enough for me. The nature of the gifts and the way they are supposed to be inherited were alien and illogical. The style of writing was enjoyable though, which made up for a bit of the alienation. But it was not enough. I could not relate to the main character and his reasons for blindfolding himself all through the major part of the book. The concept of the gifts is interesting, but I'm afraid that the way it was executed here did not draw me into the story. It's a very short story though. So if you are interested in trying out something completely different in the fantasy genre, you wouldn't loose that much time by giving it a try."
1,Ends before it begins,"When I got to the end I couldn't help thinking, ""What a great introduction"". Unfortunately that's all it was to me. Worth 99 cents perhaps, but ridiculous at over 6 dollars. Spend your money on finished works, not this."
1,Alternative Point of View,"Interesting theme - horrid writing style. I really did not like the authors style and found myself skimming, just to enable myself to get through the book.Similar theme - better book would be The Giver."
2,"Imaginative, but undeveloped","I was drawn in to this book because of it's curious characters and the story of a community of people with special gifts, but was really disappointed with the abrupt ending. I felt as if this book was thrown together haphazardly and the author expects the reader to fill in the blanks. Why did the boy really wear the blindfold so long? The lack of foreshadowing and the ultimate resolution of the father, son relationship was disappointing. I also felt sad that the children never developed a proper respect or understanding of their gifts and heritage. Alot of promise and very disappointing."
4,Beautiful coming-of-age story,"A young boy strives to be like his father, to be worth his father's love. In his world this doesn't just mean following his father's career, but inheriting his magical skill (his Gifts) as well. Orrec strives so hard to be the perfect son, but learns there's more to life. ""To thine own self be true"" says the old, our-world adage. And ""Love your neighbor as yourself."" But Orrec must learn to love himself before he can be sure he won't be a danger to his neighbor: The first of Ursual Le Guin's Gifts series, and a really enjoyable book.Disclosure: I bought this one then I had to buy the rest of the series."
5,Gifted Writer,"Ursula K. Le Guin brings us another beautiful story with characters we learn to care about and situations that are true to life though contained in a fantasy land. And though I hated to close this book, I was heartened that we get to see Orrec and Gry grown up in another story (VOICES). Le Guin's prose warms like a seat by the hearth."
2,"you are gunna take it back, I garentee it",good grafics but gameplay was boring cause u die at a part then u try and try to get past that part and every time u run out of live u hafta restart from the beggining
2,not what I expected,"Based on other reviews, and my love of many Native American recordings, I thought I would love this CD. I was wrong. Just not my style. Next time I'm definitely going to have to listen to the tracks before I buy. A few of the songs are nice, but most just not what I like."
4,looking for music to remember the Lewis&Clark expedition,"I haven't listen to the whole CD yet, but from what I could gather, the name and the music samples make me think this is the best music companion for my trip down the Columbia river. I'll be on the river 200 years to the date when Lewis&Clark; continued their journey from the Snake River, into the Columbia and finally the ocean.I'll let you know if it work indeed."
5,The Best Ever!,"This is the first CD I have ever bought, or heard, from Native Americans. Now, I listen to it over and over and over again, no matter what I am doing. It is very beautiful with a variety of calming, moving sounds. You can feel the music move right through you, clensing your mind, body and senses.I definitely recommend this CD above all others."
5,Very nice authentic native music,"If your looking for authentic Native American music, then this CD has what you want. Its based on water so many of the tracks contain soft noises of running streams, rain, thunder and sometimes birds chriping. To me all this does it helps set it up like your listening to the music played next to a lake or stream or in celebration of a storm...its very nice. There are a couple tracks that feature some commentary from Natives, very very wise words. He speaks of how the fresh water on this planet is quickly becoming scarce. One of my favorite lines from the track Wind River: ""Long for the days when the earth had four corners, the water circle carved out the streams, the lakes, the rivers. The waters ran swiftly, unabated, uninhibited....and the world had four corners"" followed by a Native call echoing in the distance. Overall its a great CD, very nice listening."
2,"More music, less talk","I buy CDs like these (Native American flute and drum) for the music. I find it very soothing when I want to relax or as background music at small get-togethers. On this CD somewhere towards the end of the first track or maybe the middle of the second track, a man begins giving a speech or maybe a sermon about clean water and how soon we won't have any, yadda, yadda, yadda. It's not that I'm insensitive to the serious current threats to our environment. But I thought I was buying soft music to relax to."
5,Amazing fast lens for the money,"I love this lens!By far, the best fast prime lens for the Leica screwmount or M-mount cameras for <$500. The main competitors are going to be over 40 years old and are usually softer wide open. The Nokton is very sharp at f/1.5, which is the primary reason to buy a fast lens.It's a Leica thread mount, which is good because there aren't other modern lenses for the older M39 mount cameras, such as the Leica III or Canon P. You also can use it on an M-mount with an adapter. (But you can't use an M-mount lens on a screw mount camera)"
5,So Nice!!!,"The ""Appleyard Riding School - Wood Barn and Stable Set"" is adorable and my horse-loving daughter, age 6, enjoys playing with it! I suggest getting some strong adhesive and attaching the fence to the base. This one is a keeper!!"
5,I love it!,"This sandal is great. It's got great arch support, it feels like suede, and looks awesome. It's really cheap too. It seems to run about a 1/2 a size small, so go one size bigger when you order. Super fast shipping too."
5,"Grushecky's ""A Good Life"" is a great listen!!!","Veteran rocker Joe Grushecky is back with a new CD, entitled A Good Life. In an age where there's possible instant fame with TV shows and slick videos, Grushecky did it the old fashioned way: grinding it out in clubs and theatres over the years. Starting 25 years ago with his band, The Iron City Houserockers, Grushecky's always been part working class hero & part philosopher. It's a combination that has held up over time and this new CD is full of tunes that will make you think as well as crank up the stereo. Gary Borress, NYC"
5,My son's eating peas! And asking for more!!!,"My son (since he was 14 months old) has loved these dried peas. They are crispy, sweet and very tasty. I add them to soup, salads, baked potatoes and snack on them guilt free! I keep mine in the freezer and they don't go ""stale"" and loose their crispyness... no defrosting needed. Even if they get left out and loose some crisp, put them in the freezer and they're just like new."
5,Yummy Peas,"Product is very tasty and yummy snack. I share it with my Amazon parrot, Finley, who agrees! It also arrived very quickly."
2,Rubber Made,"Laura, a writer, needs to get away from a potentially bad relationship. So she heads to the town where she was born and where her parents died questionable deaths. She discovers some unique uses for neoprene and what really happened to her parents. The book is mostly sex with some plot thrown in, which would be great except the ""good parts"" where only ok and the plot felt contrived. There are better books with more artistic and erotic merits."
5,Fela & Ginger...Let's Get Started!!,"I heard Ginger Baker and Fela Ransome-Kuti for the first time at a Fraternity Party, I was 18 years old and had been experiencing lot's of different music. When I heard the song on this album, I just couldn't stop dancing! That was in 1970, now it's 2003 and I'm 53 years old and still can't stop dancing when I play it. These two guys were a match made in heaven. Each track had that heavy beat and lot's of tight horns in the background. I could just see myself in the middle of the crowd while they played. There is something magical about the sound of the drums and the echo of Fela's voice that hypnotized and mezmerized me until the whole album had played. Today I still feel that jolt when I play it. Now that's music that has and will forever stand the test of time. If this is the first time you have had the chance to listen to this album, make sure you have your dance partner with you. It's impossible to listen to all that funk and sit still."
3,Unsure,"Cannot rate the item because I do not have a DVD player. We play all of our DVDs on our X-Box and this DVD will not play on the x-box, I guess it is not compatible? It should be, all of our other DVDs play just fine. I was pleased with the delivery time and condition of this item."
4,cozy but too conservative,"These Hannah Swenson books are very good, but seem to sterotype small town life as very conservative, which having been to many small towns, is inaccurate. Wild stuff goes on, perhaps behind close doors, but it goes on!Other than Hannah's overreaction to her youngest sisters clothing and dental choices, and her wishy washiness with which guy she likes, the charactor is likable. But, geeze, Hannah, hook up with one of the guys. Get some action honey!The mystery isn't difficult to figure out but works prefectly for the cozy atmosphere. I look forward to reading more, even with the old fashioned attitudes of the townspeople."
4,Fun for the 4th,"In the latest installment of Hannah Swensen's life as the Cookie Jar's owner we find her in the middle of a murder mystery in the summer. Hannah not only has to stay afoat with all the 4th of July happenings, two very eligible men, and a murder involving her famous Lemon Meringue Pie, she also has to keep the Cookie Jar and her diet working. To get to the bottom of this one she has to do her usual snooping under the police radar(even though they know this time) and delve into the past to find the answers.This is a great summer read and had it all: mystery, food, great laughs(from the Dolores, the mom) and great character development. I can't wait to dive into the next one: Fudge Cupcake Murder."
4,Lemon Meringue Pie Murder,I am so glad that Amazon developed Kindle so that I can read series like this and not have it take up all my shelves. I really like this series. It is such a cozy mystery that they are very hard to put down. I don't know how she comes up with so many different kinds of murders in such a small town but I can't get enough.
4,Lemon Lovers,I loved book 4 in this series. Hannah really shows her stuff this go around even though you can figure out who did it early in the book ( at least I did ) it was still a fun read.
4,"an easy, yummy read","Joanne Fluke's Hannah Swensen mystery series is a fun read. Hannah had been finding an alarming number of dead bodies, previously. It was nice to see someone else be ""first on the scene"". This book also played up the romantic relationship Hannah enjoys with her two suitors.Hannah is branching out into other dessert specialties, and may soon be known as something other than ""The Cookie Lady"". This was a fast read, with enough ""mystery"" to keep me reading quickly to the end of the book."
5,"great light, clean reading and recipes that are easy and tasty!!","great light reading. Joanne Fluke does not rely on sex or gore to create a story that is entertaining. she often provides a few interesting factoids throughout too. and the recipes in all the Hannah Swensen novels I've read are my favorites. I use almost no other cookie recipes anymore. you don't need to let the butter soften first, and you don't need to use a mixer. and the results --yum!!!"
4,"Fun, easy read","I really like the Hannah Swenson murder mystery series. I'm currently on book 9 (this is book 4), which should tell you I'm hooked. The books are quick, easy and fun to read and always keeps me guessing until the end. I also love the fact that every novel comes with several recipes for delicious desserts, and even some savory items. I'm even debating buying the cookbook so I will have all the recipes in one place!"
5,This is what I have been looking for,This is a great video. A professor had shown it in our classroom and I couldn't wait to have my own copy. There are many helpful and easy suggestions to understand ways to work with children with disabilities and or behavior problems.
5,Great little machine,I bought this machine for my daughter. She loves this machine! I tried it myself while visiting her. I made four batches of bread! We just kept eating it! I let the machine make the dough and then I removed the dough to make rolls. YUM! I recommend it heartily.
4,Cool!,"for being only about 30 bucks, I was really impressed at how good a shape it was in and how it looks exactly like the one in the games."
5,Soul Reaver!!! Huzzah,"Length:: 4:11 MinsHere's my video review of Soul Reaver, and a little bit of it's history read from some notes I jotted down.Overall fit and finish looks nice and will make a great wall hanger, it's not functional and I would not recommend using it for anything other than decoration, annoying your girlfriend, or cosplay, if you want a usable blade, I'd look into Cold Steel's line of swords, fantasy blades are notorious for snapping and injuring the user.With that said, taking it for what it is, a decoration, I'd say this is your best bet if you want to own Soul Reaver, and suck the souls out of your pets and girlfriend, there's nothing quite like waving this thing around slowly and evil like, with Legacy of Kain music playing in the background making your girlfriend and cat think you've lost your mind lol."
3,Don't fear the reaver,The sword was in good shape and looks just like Kain's weapon in the video game. Great for costume or looks purposes. Not to be used for fighting this is strictly a conversation or show piece.
5,Awesome book,Amazing insights into the OT. Clearly explains OT references to the Messiah (as fulfilled by Yeshua of Nazareth) and the plurality of the godhead. Written in a very easy to read and well organized manner.Essential for those wishing to talk to the Jewish unbeliever about Christ.
4,Excellent book by Mr Fruchtenbaum,"Greetings to all. I have read Arnold fruchtenbaum's book "" Messianic Christology"". It is one of the best life of Christ books from a Jewish perpsective that I have read to date. Mr Fruchtenbaum goes thru the Law, Prophets, and the writings to show that Jesus is in all of them. An excellent read to a Jew who wants to know Yeshua (Jesus) as Messiah or the Gentile Christian wanting to know more of the Jewish roots of the Christian Faith. Enjoy. David"
5,Great review of Old Testament Messianic Prophecy,"This book is a wonderful review of Old Testament Messianic prophecy. It's well-written, concise and scholarly. Christians will benefit greatly by understanding this material.I've also found it to be an important witnessing tool to Muslims as they've been taught to be mistrustful of New Testament authors. It's so important to be able to show them the consistency of the Old and New Testaments. (And they are consistent!)And, of course, it's critical material to help Jews find, know and love their Messiah."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"Dr. Fruchtenbaum's insights from the Hebrew text as well as the Jewish historical documents are brought together and expressed masterfully. But a person need not be a Hebrew scholar to understand what is in this book. For clear explanation of the Old Testament passages that foretell the coming of the Messiah, this book is unparalleled. I refer to this book often and recommend it heartily."
1,Joystick Snapped,I recently bought this aftermarket n64 controllers and have found that they are garbage. If you want a good n64 controller go with the superpad plus(rare) for twenty dollars on ebay instead because the joystick is metal and won't snap right off leaving you with a hunk of worthless plastic.
1,Dead slow dead boring,Both Wobble and Laswell have done far better things than this uninteresting mish mash of virtually nothing. Radioaxiom for example wipes it off the board.
2,Not a Woodstock,"For a concert this size, one would expect professional filming. Both the audio and video are poorly done. I reccomend this only if your a fan of 60's mega concerts like Woodstock & just got to have it for your collection. Otherwise, don't waste your money. I must say Santana rocked, but don't they always."
5,Excellent Cat Food,"Love this cat food! It has reduced the smell of my male cat's poop. Now I can hardly tell when he's gone in his cat box. Also, after several months of use of this cat food, his coat is very shiny and healthy. He likes this food and never complains about wanting something else."
1,My finicky cat will barely eat this,"Having seen the TV adds for Blue Buffalo pet foods I was very optimistic to try this for my adult cat. She is very finicky, preferring canned shredded meat to dry food though she will nibble on food like some major brand Cat Chow during the day. So, I ordered a bag of this and she hardly touches it. If I offer it her in the morning and then fresh servings at lunch and dinner, she barely nibbles at it and sits by her bowl and mews. Usually it's not until close to dinner time when she;ll actually start nibbling on this. I was very disappointed because I really liked the health benefits for he but if she won't eat it then that really dos her no goof. I will have to try the wilderness variety next."
3,Not as good as Jesus in Me (fruit of the spirit),This is still a good effort but it basically just rewords 1 Corinthians 13 passage in simple words without giving as many clear examples or situations.
1,Very disappointed in quality of photos,"Many of the picts were taken on a dark background, obscuring the details of the crystals. In addition, the images are not zoomed in to depict the details of the stones. I compared my specimens to the ones in the book and I determined that I would not have been able to identify them had I only had this book as a pictorial resource. Save your money - not a good book at all."
2,Not what I expected,"I own the ""Crystal Bible"" and was hoping this book would have similar pictures.I was very disappointed and would be hesitant to buy another pictoral by this author."
4,Traveling around Bolivia without a tourguide,"Eric Lawlor describes his travels in Bolivia, and gives some idea of what it is like to travel off the beaten track on your own.The first couple of chapters are studded with references of questionable value, supposedly ""humerous"" comments (like he had trouble with 1000 feet of altitude, but finally made it, and then got out of the truck he was riding in), and observations which I found sufficiently detracting from the topic that I almost quit reading, but it gets better when he gets out into the areas further from La Paz.(Regarding another review questioning how many governments Bolivia has had - wikipedia shows quite a few.)Not a bad read."
1,"In any other country , but Bolivia","It's my personal oppinion, and I believe from anyone in my country, or whoever made the big mistake of buying this book, and know a lot of Bolivia, more than this simple guy who only travel to my country seeking for get drunk any day, I hate the way he see my country, and talk about it.Also, I never heard, and I know a lot of Bolivian history, that we had 16 COnstitutions and 250 governments, whoever was his guide, or his informer... wasn't good at allIf you really want to know about Bolivia, you will skip this story about his trip, acting like a burglar as any american does in my country.I hope this writer read my review, and think about his career, because is not a writer for sure, just a lier."
1,"Maybe I got a damaged pair, but my son who never cries for more than 2 mins, cried all day while wearing these shoes.",these shoes are cute to look at but they almost made a permanent groove in my 16 month sons toes. He cried so much all day from wearing these shoes. I had no idea it was the shoes making him cry. I thought he had a tummy ache. I ended up returning them the very next day. I bet it was a defective shoe because usually I love stride rite.
2,Fell Short,"I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't. The premise is very interesting, everything that happened at the fall of the Roman Empire. But the delivery fell short. The formatting was just terrible, without clear paragraph breaks or section breaks. The author used different spellings for the character names depending on whether the person narrating was Roman or not, and I understand what she was trying to do, but it was confusing. If that were the only problem the book had I could forgive it, but there were too many other problems. It's a shame too because I think there is a good story there, but it just didn't work for me."
2,"Great at first, then it broke","This item worked great at first. It was quiet, and diffused into the night. However, about a month after purchase, the interior reservoir broke after routinely fighting to get the additional water source into the machine. Not a very user friendly product."
2,CHEAP,"cheap product. very disappointed. after using for a short time, the plastic cover broke, the pastic threads on the cap wore and no longer attached properly, and the piece that keeps the water inside kept falling off into the water chamber. i ended up buying a nebulizer and it works much better."
5,Oregon Scientific MP210,like very mach the product for had voice recorder al radio very mucho also for the batery is work more time other product today on the market realy recomet the product other buy is realy good product also the pray in amazon
1,Oregon scientific MP210,"I bought this instrument and it was spoilt within 2 months.The navigation to songs isnt user friendly.Even though I charge the battery completely, the instrument turns off abruptly.Sometimes it never goes on.Tried resetting it, charging it..nothing works.I am not sure whether its a defect with the instrument or the product, but would never go for it again."
1,I do NOT recommend this book,"I was attracted to this book by the post 9/11 plot device, but was completely turned off by it. It is poorly written with very little character development. It requires you to suspend belief at many points (failure to monitor e-mails, performance at a military training course, etc.). Nearly every Arab character is a terrorist. Christian values are exalted over other religious beliefs. In this book, Iraq has WMD and is actively involved in planning a major terrorist activity -- clearly proven untrue. Finally, the use of a lot of real characters (NY Mayor Rudy Guiliani and others) mixed in with the fictional ones could mislead the unsophisticated reader and makes me wonder how much the political views of the author were influential in shaping the plot. I don't think we need more literature that foments anti-Arab sentiments."
1,A horrible book,"Every now and then I come across a book almost too unbelievable in plot and writing style to merit comment. This book surpasses this threshold and has added new meaning to the word ""trash"". I suspect it sucked out at least 30 IQ points from my basic intelligence. A person will basically become retarded after reading this book.The most interesting part was looking at the author's picture on the dustjacket. Her lazy eye is the most intriguing part of this publication."
1,i thought it was a bad joke....,"then i realized the author did not write made for TV movies for the Lifetime Channel. This book is a hopelessly vulgar take on the tragic 9/11 events of the US. The heroine of the book is a status seeking ""socialite"" in NYC who seeks revenge against a ""terrorist"" who used to be her lover. It's an unsmart, unsexy, and an uninformed reordering of the serious matter of terrorism, and reads like a laundry list of places to be seen or people to do, or know, if you're in NYC. I thought it was just a bad book, then I googled the authors name and discovered she's something of a nefarious, man-chasing, social climbing woman in NYC. Ultimatley it's a thin veil for what must be the author's own ghastly existence. Verdict: do not read!...and I feel no grief over this conclusion."
2,Doesn't fit contour of bumper,I purchased the replica Euro plate and the bracket for the front of my 2011 Jetta TDI. If you attach the bracket to the contour of the front bumper you can't mount the plate flat. You would have to bend the plate in order to fit it into the bracket. Would look terrible. Better suited to mount on a wall.
4,Great for Beginners or as Supplemental Tool in the Classroom,"This book has been written in workbook format and includes all the main grammatical points I found in my district's first year German textbook. The themes are presented with a little more simplicity and, I believe, less confusion for the beginning 2nd language learner. I have used it as a supplemental tool to reinforce targeted structures as well as for the many drawings that are beneficial to the more visually oriented students. As a textbook for tutoring a beginner in German one on one, it has been the primary book I have used to introduce them to a new language, again because of the concise presentation of the grammatical structures, the cultural highlights, and the relevant vocabulary that a beginner needs."
2,$5 tops.,It might be useful for a beginner who is working with a tutor. Five dollars would be a fair price.
5,Marion is my favorite !!,Another book by Marion that is an easy read and really tells the whole story behind becoming a doctor. There are several interns that tell their story through internship. Great book if you are interested in the medical field.
5,Right on the nose,"As a third year resident in pediatrics, I re-read this book. I read it initially as a premed student, and I couldn't wait to live it myself. Having lived it, I'm glad I san say that I am part of a rich alumni of former interns. However, my second year was more grueling than the first. Insted of being the intern, I was supervising the interns, as well as the ICU's, My only criticism of the book is that Marion seemed to select 3 ultra whiners for his subjects. Maybe it's an East Coast thing, but even after a horrible call night or some terrible deaths, my colleagues and I rarely achieved this level of whining and self pity. Suggestion : Do a book at a Big Ten School !"
2,Not an insightful book at all....,"This is a great book if you want to read about 3 interns in the mid-80's describe their days - basically venting into a tape recorder about the frustrations of their days. I bought this book after being sucked into the genre by Atul Gawande's ""Complications,"" and bought both ""Intern Blues"" and Michael Ruhl's ""Walk on Water"". I highly recommend both of the other books - they have exactly what I read non-fiction for - thoughtful, insightful analysis of a subject I'd like to know more about. ""Intern Blues""... I wouldn't have bothered to finish the book if I hadn't spent money on it."
5,A Great Book for Everyone,"I'll preface this review by saying my knowledge of the medical profession is minimal at best. However, Marion's book was among the best I've read in a long time. The story of how three interns struggle to make it throught a year is emotionally draining and exhilarating at the same time. Marion does an excellent job of describing all medical terms and summarizing the stress that the interns are going through. After having read this book I have a greater respect and understanding of what current doctors go through to get to their positions. ""The Intern Blues"" is well worth reading for doctors and non-doctors alike."
3,not bad but a bit tiresome,"I read this book after reading House of God and Mount Misery. Same topic, very different voice(s). At times this book was tiresome, at times I couldn't put it down. Things have changed a whole lot since 1985 in the world of interns, but there are still alot of things I couldn't believe I heard someone else complaining about besides me! Worth reading but feel free to skip ahead a few chapters if your'e getting bored."
1,Home burned DVDs,"I can't comment on the content of the DVD - I haven't watched them. Why not? These are not ""standard"" DVDs but are burned. They will not play on any player that will not play a ""home-made"" DVD.The big print on the Amazon page for this product indicated DVD format. The fine print indicates: ""DVD-R Note: This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com""Buyer beware!!"
3,Not Enough Up-front Information,Joel Harper's Fit Pack - Nine Short WorkoutsWhat I was looking for was Joel Harper's workout with resist tubes that was featured on RealAge. The Fit-Pack was not it. I am certain the Fit Pack delivers what it promises for people looking for this type of workout. Joel's workouts are clearly represented and effective.
4,thoughts,"great workouts, tones and improves bodyJoel is a little annoying and there could be better music"
2,Why so expensive?,"I would like to try this DVD, but seems rather expensive considering I can get other great workouts of similar length for under $15! Can anyone explain why Joel's workout is worth the high price?"
4,happy with Japanese tag,I was happy with the product and how quickly I received it the only thing that could have been different is the tag needed holes so it could be placed onto the car. But we were able to place holes into it and place on car thanks
5,'Good value.,"I shopped other ramps for my John Deere X300 mower, and was a little concerned when these were half of the price of some others. But, I needed a load capacity of only 750 pounds, so I ordered them. They are perfect for what I need, and because of the arched section, the mower housing does not scrape the ramps when loading or unloading."
5,Excellent,"I had previously owned a set of home made ramps. they were good but not really safe. I shopped around for something better and ended up with Dual Arched Folding ATV Ramps. They are really quality made and very rugged, the welds are very strong and neat looking and the hinge points are well made and rugged and have large and strong hinge bolts. Being made of aluminum they are also easy to handle. The safety straps are well made and convenient to use. Sometimes when you buy things over the internet it is a hit and miss situation,not this time. this time it was a sure home run."
3,Good Collection But Poor Quality,"I have spent the past two year listening to every scrap of Carter Family music that I could find, and I was very excited to see this on Amazon. There are just so many songs! My only real complaint is that the sound quality is really bad. I realize that most of these were probably transferred from old records, but I have encountered other albums in the past where the sound quality was as crisp as a newly recorded song. I just feel like there was little effort put into the restoration of these tracks."
3,"fantastic music, ""remastered"" claim is a bit strong","You expect a bit of static with old recordings. But when they are remastered you don't expect that every song will sound like somebody's shaking gravel around in a metal pan right next to the mic. This is the first time in years I've head to mess with my EQ.Of course, the Carter Family is the Carter Family. Which is to say, fantastic. There's a lot of music here, but if you're after high quality recordings you might have better luck elsewhere. I'll leave it to the reader to do the cost/benefit analysis."
4,Better than expected...,"I've been using K&N; replacement filters for many years on my vehicles but never did a cold air intake till this one. I have to say I am very impressed with the increased power from the engine this simple kit provided. For the most part installation was simple, only issue I had was some of the instructions seem to skip a step here or there but if you're semi intelligent you can figure it out. Only one step really had a problem and that was because they tell you to loosen two bolts and one nut but they didn't say which nut, a bit of trial and error helped me find the correct nut and that was my only install issue.After having it on for two weeks I can report the added intake noise is minimal till 3000 rpm which makes it perfectly fine for most driving conditions, but when you want to push it the added sound is great and very sporty.Really thinking hard on getting another one for my wife's vehicle now."
2,A bit of a snooze,"I know many people have great reverence for Freeman Tilden. He is quoted by everyone who is in the business of creating compelling interpretive stories about natural and cultural resources. Although this is a book you should read if this is your profession, make sure you have lots of coffee and a strong will to get through it. I can't and I've given it my best effort. It has been painful. Maybe it needs more pictures--something! I know what I'm saying will sound blasphemous to many and that I'm speaking ill of the dead.Sorry."
2,where's Laswell?,"I know Laswell is a experimentalist but this one is a little to boring. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you would like to own every Laswell album every recorded. It is basically a constant hum, with some fluxuation."
5,One of my favorites,"I bought this CD a while ago, and I was looking for a nice Christmas CD to give to friends. When I saw that the only review it had on Amazon is for 1 star, I had to write my own, as we love this CD. Over the years this has become one of my (and my family's) favorite Christmas CDs. I own 50 or 60 Christmas CDs of various genres. I love the variety and the relaxing Christmas music. I hope you like it as I do. My favorite on the CD is ""A Simple Birth."""
5,my favorite Christmas CD,"This mellow, instrumental CD is great music to play during a party or small gathering. This is my favorite Christmas CD!"
2,Arkansas lawyer on his own,"Gideon Page gets fired and starts on his own with a manslaughter client and a woman who bakes rats. I had hopes that this book would be much better, but the action was slow. It took forever to get to the court scenes, and they were dissappointing. I never figured out what motivated Dr Chapman to be so stubborn with his lawyer. There are parts of this book which entertain with appealing characters, but overall, I had to force myself to finish it."
5,Turn of the Century Poetey,"This is a wonderful little book of poems. Printed in 1913 it contains poetry with a positive, sunny view of life. Nice addition to any poetry collection or as a gift for a friend."
3,"I got what I paid for, and am happy with it...","But I only paid nineteen for mine, and didn't have unrealistic expectations about what I might get for my money. Not clear what some people's issues with the camera are, mine came with a clearly printed instruction manual, the software installed OK, and the pics look well worth the price. It's webcam function works better than most webcams I've seen people pay more for."
1,camera review,I found the product to be made very poorly....all it too is one drop on the floor and the camera battery door cracked and that was is for the camera too....NOT A KID friendly camera at all.
1,DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA,"What a total piece of junk, of course the kid received it as gift with no receipt...It worked for almost 15 minutes for 20 bucks."
2,Waste of Money!,"Don't waste your money on this inexpensive digital camera - even at about $25, it's too much to spend for such a low quality item! I've already returned one (Toys-R-Us was great about the return!), after the shutter button broke after 3 days of normal usage/play. The camera is very cheaply made and not durable. It's almost impossible to get the wrist strap attached. Most importantly, the quality of the photos is terrible (fuzzy, grainy to the point of being unrecognizable!) - even on the best resolution where you can only take 19 pictures before needing to download. Another downside is that there is no screen to view the photos on the camera (which even the youngest kids expect these days!). The software that comes with the camera is confusing, but does have some cool backgrounds & picture editing effects."
1,Don't Recommend,"I purchased this for my 4 year old son because he LOVES to take pictures. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use. Not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working. However, when it did work every single picture was blurry. There is only one button for every option and it is very confusing. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. It is being returned."
1,Don't waste the money,was dropped onece and it broke. Computer doen't recongise software with windows xp. kids were disappointed they couldn't see there pictures. Called the company and they were no help.
1,Dont Buy,This camera was a pain to pick the mode to get the camera to work. It's batteries died all the time and lost all of the pictures. When you did get a picture loaded on the computer the software was terrible. We trashed it within 2 weeks of purchasing!
1,Bought for my 8 year old son,"Talk about being upset!!!!! My son thought he was getting a camera like Mom's but this camera did not work right out of the box. We thought we had set it up wrong, or the batteries were dead...couldn't get it to work even after reading the little booklet and changing the batteries. When we tried to download his pictures and mine, the computer kept saying that there were no pictures to download! A complete waste of money it's going back for a REAL camera!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,Very poor pictures. Young child can delete pictures they have took. The same mode button to use when turning on to take pictures if child clicks one to many times it deletes all pictures. I am going to bring it back and buy something more kid friendly.
2,"Digital Camera good software, poor quality","The Camera itself is very durable and would withstand a drop making it good for child usage. The software makes it very easy to upload photos and manipulate them and children would have a lot of fun with the different options available on the program. The webcam mode is simple to use, however it's hard to take pictures while using that mode. Now for the negative, the viewfinder doesn't line up even close to the photo, when you look through the view finder; the bottom of the photo is cut off quite a bit compared to what was seen. The photo quality is shoddy at best. Things that are smooth look grainy; the slightest movement causes the entire photo to blur to unrecognizable. And even without movement, the pictures are hard to make anything other than blurry or out of focus."
1,one star is one star too many,"Complete piece of crap! Even if you receive a unit that works, it will work so poorly even in ""high resolution"" mode you will wonder why you bothered at all. To be more specific, these cameras suffer from* very low quality construction* complete lack of ruggedness* cryptic menu system* poor documentation* difficult to operate* extremely low quality photos* crappy software (which may even by spyware)Seriously, these things are horrible. Even for kid's snapshots, horrible, horrible, horrible. By something else, even if it's a single-use film camera."
1,Horrible camera,"I bought this camera for my 8 yr old daughter and it did not work. I had trouble even trying to get the camera to turn on and stay on. I was unable to download any of the images either. I did not expect a whole lot for 20 dollars, but I expected it to, at least, take pictures. It could'nt even do that. Thumbs way down for this product."
1,Worst digital camera EVER,"This is the absolute biggest waste of money. Directions are written in broken English and make no sense. To give you a sample, ""If display screen says 'Hi resolution' this means camera is in low resolution mode."" Yeah. Sure. Totally logical. The worst part is that pictures just get erased from the camera without you doing anything to make that happen. Not good after my 5 year-old spent the day snapping shots of animals at our local zoo, only to have NONE saved. Just a bad product all around."
1,ZERO STARS,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday, and despite the difficult codes on the miniscule display, we managed to take 50+ photos. Unfortunately, we cannot comment on the quality of the photos, as we were unable to sucessfully install the software on our computer. Kidz cam sent us new software, which also did not work. The second time around, after at least 30 minutes on hold with Kidzcam (I am not exaggerating), we were told we need to speak to the developers of the software, and not the producers of the camera. Well, they never got back to me. It's a shame I cannot return this product, I no longer have the packaging, and it is full of photos that I am afraid I will never see. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,not a good buy,"i bought this for my 10 year old son. first off it does not take good pics whatsoever and then when i put the software on my comp. to upload, it gave me a virus!! deleted, cleaned, tried again, did the same thing. took it back and got my money back. do not buy this b/c all pics were blurry and you could barely see what it was supposed to be."
1,Just Does Not Work,"I bought two of these cameras, one for each child. The kids were excited, but were later disappointed. We were able to load the software fine, but it gave us an error message when we tried to load the photos. We are professional web designers, so we know our way around a computer. We tried the software and camera from each of the two packages. We tried different computers we have. There was just no way for us to get the photos off the camera. We even got the error message when importing existing photos we had on our computer. It just would not work."
1,Bad all the way around,none of the 18 pictures we took came out even remotely as good as old first generation digital cameras I chucked 5 years ago - this one is definitely going back.
1,Junk Junk Junk,"Gets 1 star only because that is the lowest rating allowed. The money was not the problem, as it was given to my grandson as a gift - it was the time that I wasted trying to get the camera to work - never succeeded. I can't believe that any North American retailer would try to sell this. Obviously, they never tested the product themselves! The English in the instruction manual is ""literally translated"" resulting in nonsensical jibberish. To sum up - I got one picture (of our ceiling) and that was all - it never worked beyond that."
1,Don't Buy This Camera!!,"I purchased this camera for my 9 year old at christmas. It says that it has taken 18 photos, but the software and my computer have only been able to download 3. The Web cam feature works alright, but the software for downloading crashes, pictures will not download and I have yet to find a site for the manufacturer. It is better to spend a little more money for REAL digital camera or have your children use film cameras. This product is total garbage."
1,this camera is a piece of junk!,"today my mom got me the kidz cam digital camera. it was so hard to figure it out. i never got to use yet because i have spent the time with my camera searching the web trying to figure the darn thing out. it didnt even come with instructions!!! i am still dumbfounded as to how to work it. reading the other reviews, i dont see any use in exchanging it for the others seemed not to work either! that for one is why i gave evry question above 1 star because it doesnt work! therefore how shall i answer honestly if i do not know?!?!?! it doesnt seem durable either! and the screen is extremly small! im not even sure if when you take a picture it will show up on the screen! with the continuing complaints i myself do not recomend it!!! looks can be deciving, and so can advertisment.your once valued customer,kelsey"
1,Waste of Money,"There are too many things wrong with this camera to list them all.Seriously, the biggest waste of money ever."
1,An absolute piece of junk!,"This item may be the worst thing I've ever purchased. The pictures it takes could hardly be called pictures -- the quality was unimagineably bad. The software crashed our computer, and the camera is cheaply made. After getting no relief from the seller, I threw it in the garbage.Save yourself the trouble and STAY AWAY from this camera!"
1,Useless Product,This is the most useless kids product we ever got. This was xmas present for our kids. The software is crappy. The mode button is complex and not fit for kida. Basically a kid unfriendly camera. one other low quality no good made in CHINA toy that US retailers force upon us.The picture is worst. Please do not buy it. This is not worth the effort.
1,Extraordinarily Poor Quality,"I agree with all the other one star reviews. This camera is the worst. We also bought it thinking it would be low quality, but good enough for a child. Not so. The pictures are horribly blurry and are the washed-out orange that another reviewer mentioned. The quality was shockingly poor even for a child's product. On the bright side, it's a great opportunity to teach your children about advertising, disappointment, etc. For example, the packaging is fairly engaging--makes it look fun and interesting--but it's SO not. Price is not always a dead giveaway, but in this case, it was the first clue. You can also talk to your children about the importance of doing research before you buy a product, buying only from a source where you can get your money back if not satisfied and saving the receipt. It can also transition into a savings lesson as well, because a good camera will cost around three times as much.VTech Kidizoom Digital Camera"
1,Pathetic- total disappointment,"We bought this camera as a try-out for our kids to see if they got into photography before buying a more expensive model. After they opened it, I had them try it and uploaded the photos to the included program. The pictures were beyond grainy, hardly viewable on screen. To add insult to injury, the thing died the first time it was dropped (less than two feet) by our four year old, and even my Mr. Fixit husband was unable to revive it.Bottom line- don't waste your time or money on this thing. It's junk."
3,Hot chicks & Lots of Carnage!,"Skin eating jungle vamps tells the tale of a race of Cannibal alien babes from the planet clitorian. A young woman while on trip to the jungles of the amazon is kidnapped by the sexually fueled and bloodthirsty babes and never returns home leaving her family in the states very suspicious of her whereabouts , the woman's sister finally decides after a ton of worrying to come the rescue. Skin eating jungle vamps is full of Great tits, blood and carnage enough to satisfy any gorehound. The sisters finally meet in a crazy climax (literally) you have to see to believe... Featuring The cult superstar- Mr Creepo."
3,"Mr Creepo does his Thang again,AND its 2011.","OK,What the heck ? There are lots of women,and not lots of clothes or plot.Mr Creepo has this David `The Rock' Nelson and Donald G. Jackson pseudo-thingy attitude about making films.Why does it make these excuse to have girls rub on each other and always play the bad guy himself,Because he can .So,After you play Beer Pong so many hours and are alittle tipsy...WHAT else to do raid big brothers nerd dvds of porn and there is the gems like SEJV and probably alphabetical and check marks with exposed book count,On Youtube this was counted as 14 seen !!!Amazing facts: SEJV was originally released in 2001 as a VHS and this is its third time to be on DVD !"
3,BILL LASWELL sampled here,"Upon hearing the tracks on this sampler, you may find yourself seeking out the individual releases. More sonic thunder from the mind of Bill Laswell and his numerous friends."
5,This video is great!!,This entertaining music video has great music videos and comments by Travis Tritt!!
2,tame,"this music just seems tame and uneventful to me . The soloists are adequate , the arrangements are perfunctory , the songs are decent basic ideas that need more development . Sort of Mostly Autumn with something missing."
2,find a style...,"I bought this cd based on other reviews and seeing it in people's listmanias. What a disappointment. It seems WW can't make up their mind what type of sound they want. It's all over the place. Most songs sound like Kate Bush and even The Sundays (Joyride). For good measure a goth metalish song (Ghost) is thrown in. The only song that has a progressive feel to it is Splinters. This disc lacks any kind of consistency whatsoever. On one positive note, I did like the female vocals. Just pick a style and work with it!"
5,Great Job!!,"I have to admit that I have not followed the Ramsey case very closely over the last 3 years because I have been living in Tokyo. I wanted to understand what happened during this investigation, and I wanted a book that reads like a case file. This book is exactly what I ordered. Very well written, I think that Steve is THE most organized detective in the world! The facts are clearly laid out in front of you, even though he is biased, I feel that it was presented well. Very highly recommended!"
2,JonBennet: justice failed,Too much Personel opinion and one sided facts? Twisted facts to match the authors opinion. Totally biased. Excuses for everything that points AWAY from the parents. Wouldn't buy again.
4,STILL A FEW MISSING PIECES,"After reading Steve Thomas's book, I am better able to understand the politics of Boulder, however, I am not inclined to believe his theory that Patsy acted alone in killing Jonbenet. I have very strong feelings that John Ramsey was involved, possibly with other men, in the killing of his daughter. The Ramseys are very wealthy and well connected. People have alluded to a child sex ring in Boulder, and I certainly wouldn't be too quick to doubt it. Someone is doing everything possible to cover up this crime. Sadly, no one will ever be brought to justice. In this country, you get the justice you can afford."
1,developed detective,"I must say that reading Steve's book and seeing him on CNN I felt I was watching a trainwreck, a vindictive man out for blood, Pat and John's blood this time. The media spin was convincing, the Ramseys certainly appeared guilty, so Thomas's accusations blaming the Ramseys' about information leaks to the press runs well...flat. The Ramsey's themselves knew they were on the outs with public opinion, the vicious and cruel remarks and overted glances from strangers. After reading this book I found myself searching the internet and finding further evidence that would clear the Ramseys and wondered why this wasnt publicized as much. We already made up our minds, the THEORY about Jonbenet was devastating. What mother would parade her daughter like a living breathing doll? What unfulfilled dreams did Patsy have? What jealousy did Patsy feel for her gorgeous daughter? We judged the Ramsey's lifestyle too much and perhaps so did the investigators."
1,Terrible Book!,"If one didn't know better, they would think that Steve Thomas was an excellent detective and has ""good"" evidence on who killed JonBenet. However that isn't the case. He is nothing more than a drug cop who has NEVER solved a murder, making him a VERY bad person to investigate a homicide, much less writing a book about it. According to Alex Hunter, this book is blood money, and he is right."
1,Bad detective work. Worthless Book.,"Steve Thomas, the author of this book, and his bad detective work are a big reason a presumption of guilt was put upon the Ramsey's for the last 10 years. Thanks in large part to this author Patsy Ramsey died a guilty suspect in the eyes of the public. She will now be vindicated of course and Steve Thomas looks like an idiot. Read this book if you are interested in idiot logic. To Steve. Atticus Finch, as you quoted in your resignation letter, wouldn't have ruled out everything other than the Ramsey's seemingly right off the bat."
2,"Oops, history not in his favor",We learned today the real murdered was found in Thailand. Not the mother.Good thing our system makes officials prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
3,Thomas Was Wrong,"This book is a classic example of detectives who develop 'tunnel vision' and cannot or will not investigate all possibilities involving a crime.This crime has DNA evidence and will be solved when they find a match. The Ramsey's have been ruled out -- it WAS NOT THEM.The detective who wrote this book, however, added to the incredible pain of parents who lost a child to murder by publicly accusing them of the crime. Shameful.I hope when DNA solves this murder, Thomas will make a public apology to the Ramsey's."
1,"Outdated, sensationalistic and just plain wrong","For a more comprehensive, logical, rational and better researched and developed history of this unfortunate case, look to the BBC investigation, which aired on television a few years ago. There is simply no solid proof supporting the theory of this author, and it reads little more than a smear campaign against the now-deceased Patsy Ramsey. How sad is it that we take a tragedy like this and turn it into a sensationalistic tissue of lies just to make a buck?"
1,The results of a rush to judgment,"How do all you geniuses and arm-chair detectives feel now (Thomas and all the Dolts that bought and praised this trash), that the perpetrator has been arrested and the mother of this poor girl had to endure your slanderous statements. Yes, you can rest assured that you are mistaken about alot of other things in life and should take a long hard look at yourselves."
5,"Awesome, Riveting Book!","This book is an extremely well-written, credible account of the Ramsey murder investigation from the point of view of a dedicated detective on the case.I never knew much about this case, and first read Lawrence Schiller's book, which I was disappointed in.This book cuts to the chase. In addition to being a chronology of the Ramsey case, it is also a great depiction of government bureaucracy and incompetence, and how people sometimes have to choose between their self-interest and doing the right thing."
4,Who knows what the real answer is?,"Very interesting reading...contains a few new items of information and viewpoints. The author tells how it was from his point of view, and we are left to weigh the evidence and draw our own conclusions. Will we ever really know the whole truth about this terrible crime? It's fascinating to read Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey's recent book, and then read this one. Two views of the same circumstances in total opposition with one another. The whole situation is just too sad for words."
5,This horror still haunts us,"Living 10 miles from this nightmare, that still isn't solved, makes you realize this can happen anywhere. The controversy and the publicity was so twisted, and so many things were botched from the beginning, but I really wish some closure could be reached. The person found, and put to death. But will we ever know the truth"
5,Interesting and Informative,"This book was well written and informative. Having watched this case play out in the news at the time, the book was a welcome viewpoint from ""the other side"" and a confirmation of my thoughts on this brutal and unnecessary crime. Often we take our law enforcement for granted without realizing the fine line they toe in order to serve and protect both our interests and their livelihood.[...]"
1,"""guilty until proven innocent""--this detective","These authors, one a detective--which is stunning--presumed Patsy Ramsey was guilty until proven innocent.That concept, from a so-called detective, is unbelievable, yet true.The recent program where Lou Smit revealed that Hunter tried to block him (Smit) from testifying before the grand jury and where Hunter tried to obtain Smit's evidence--legally tried, not merely asked, etc.--makes this book an embarrassment to the authors.The recent DNA evidence just adds to their embarrassment.Have these authors no shame? You decide."
3,Everybody is jumping into conclusions!,"This guy may not be the one, and for that reason only, i will say, the you need to shut up, open your eyes and pay more attention to the latest on this case, cause now, after only 3 days of this guy coming foward, everybody is having doubts about his mental health, his obssesion with the JonBenet case, and who knows what else is on his head, what's his reason for doing this; so stop cheering, and wait to see what happen, who knows, maybe the next one looking like a fool it could be YOU!"
1,not factual enough,this book deals more in media mill rumors than actual facts. it certainly demonstrates the mindset of the boulder police- there never seemed to be a question of who did it and how that decision was made.
1,Concerned Citizen,"I was forced to give this book 1 star. (Amazon that's not fair.) Here we go again with old news and old players. We already know the mistakes the police made; there were plenty. What are they doing now to find the killer? There are plenty of contradictions in this book.I am tired of people telling the Ramseys how they should have felt and acted when their daughter was murdered. You can't go there unless you've been there. Read the Ramsey's book, Death of Innocence and find out how they really felt and why they are trying to get the investigation to go forward.This situation could happen to any of us. Hiring lawyers is not hiding, but protecting yourself and your family from false accusations."
4,Pretty close,Steve's book should be taken under serious consideration by all parties involved in this case.I agree to each and every evidence set forth with this book except one thing.Steve did not convince me why brother Burke could not be the killer and John and Patsy the stagers..
2,Too much whining,Okay book but Thomas spends way too much time whining about D.A. and the other investigators. He should have focused more on the evidence. There are too many pieces of evidence he skims over as well as evidence he repeats over and over. This is no easy solve I give him that but there are too many unanswered questions to come to such a firm decision. Objective he is not and it leads the reader into the pity party that takes over this book. A good book for someone new to this mystery but not much more.
2,star,"This book is factually accurate. Thomas, however, reveals -over and over - his hard line killer cop perspective on law enforcement. As an insider in the Boulder Justice System I was pleased to see ineffeciencies and political backbiting exposed. Thomas, however, uses the book about a botched murder case to promote his own views supporting the death penality - and his shoot first - ask questions later mentality. His biases detract from the story he is telling about a specific case which deserves public scrutney. The book is reasonably well written - redundant in some place, and would have benefited from an editing that eliminated information that is repeated throughout the book."
1,Horsehockey,"This book was nothing but a noxious rant with a foregone conclusion based on nothing but smoke. The author raves about pineapple in the girl's stomach ad nauseum, which didn't even mean anything.Now that an arrest has been made and it looks like the real killer actually has been found, it'll be interesting to see the author huff and puff even after he's been proven wrong.However anyone who read the book and found it to be evidence against the Ramseys wasn't paying much attention to a little thing called facts and evidence. The author's adamant belief and adamant statements do not equal proof."
5,Patsy Ramsey Isn't the Only Guilty Party Here!,"Steve Thomas makes no bones about who he thinks killed poor JonBenet and he spells it out using the evidence as the book progresses. But the most appalling thing about the entire thing to me aside from the horrible murder itself is the ""politically correct"" District Attorney's office of Boulder Co. who sabotaged the case from the very beginning. The DA's office should be tried for abuse of office and power, Thomas' tale of political betrayal and backstabbing as the Boulder Police Dept. tried to bring a killer to justice is a crime in itself. More than one person got away with a crime on that Christmas night."
5,Great Read,"This book follows the exact seguences that went on,after the murder.It also keeps you guessing who the murderer is."
5,JonBenet's insider viewpoint convincing,"This book is a can't-put-down page turner. It is the first book that outright names Patsy Ramsey as the killer of JonBenet Ramsey. Steve Thomas was a police officer central to the JonBenet investigation who resigned from the Boulder force in protest over the lack of action in the Ramsey case. He shares insider information to support his claim, which is what makes this book such a worthwhile read. This book provides a chilling comparison to Ramseys' own book ""The Death of Innocence"". Thomas' book reveals the same truth that that was also inadvertantly revealed in the Ramsey book: Patsy Ramsey is not a victim, but rather a passive-aggressive narcissist who at the very least should be under the ""umbrella of suspicion."" Less convincing is his argument that John Ramsey helped with the murder cover-up."
1,Carpenter is his calling...,Steve Thomas certainly isn't a very good homicide detective maybe a better carpenter? His book is full of contradictions and half truths. It certainly does show why the investigation has gone nowhere. Thomas was focused on Patsy as the killer and looked at no one else. Ardnt was focused on John as the killer and looked nowhere else. Maybe now some objective police work can be done with both of them off the case.
3,"oh, the angst!","The jacket blurbs and the reviews fail to indicate an important fact: every story in this book is about a disaffected teenager. Every single one of them. Disaffected six-inch-tall teenagers. Disaffected genetically modified teenagers. Disaffected Victorian teenagers. Disaffected teenagers raised by feral librarians. Magical or mundane, ten or eighteen, they're all disaffected, and they all learn pithy lessons about finding acceptance while staying true to themselves.The individual stories aren't bad at all; Kelly Link and Ellen Klages make particularly solid contributions. If I were still a disaffected teenager, however, I'd throw this heavy-handed, preachy anthology right out the window."
4,Enjoyable read,"I enjoyed this book as an entertaining read. Some of the stories were better than others, I thought.""Huntress"" was OK -- I do love Greek mythology, so the references there were quite good, but I really didn't understand the characters' motivations.""I'll Give You My Word"" -- I love word play, so this was one of my favorites in the anthology.""The Wizards of Perfill"" -- didn't like this one much at all, mostly because I found Onion very bland and, and didn't really understand the premise of magic in the setting until close to the end.""In the House of the Seven Librarians"" -- my absolute favorite in this book!""Hives"" -- very much enjoyed this one. I found it somewhat scary, actually, how likely and believable I found the techy part of the plot!I hadn't seen these anthologies before, and now I'd like to read the original one as well. All in all, I'm glad I read this book, but I am equally glad that I checked it out from the library and didn't purchase it."
2,That didn't taste like I thought it would...,"I wanted to read some fantasy, some high IQ stuff, some thought-provoking short stories I could read on the DART getting to work. Well, after reading all of these stories, I'm convinced that writers do not submit their prize stories for anthologies. They submit their scraps. That's craps with an extra S. I'm dissapointed. Maybe my expectations were too high. Perhaps if I lower my expectations to what one might expect if judging a suburban high school writing contest...hmmm...no, I'm still dissappointed. The people who put this together owe me $10 just for reading through it. If you read this then you should demand compensation. I am not better off after reading this book. Maybe I didn't do enough shrooms before reading it. :-("
2,It's all about the tires,"The main problem with it is the wheels. They are a hollow plastic (rubber-like) material. It makes the wagon difficult to pull, steer, and noisy. The one I got was also uneven. One wheel didn't always touch the ground without a load. The door feature is nice so the kid can get in and out easier. The storage seat is useful but, should be on the side of the handle since the kid will most often be sitting in the back to face forward. The kid will or won't like it regardless of the wheels but, the parent having to pull the thing will want better wheels. Basically, you save about $20 compared to the basic plastic Radio Flyer which has real solid rubber wheels. I think the RF is definitely worth the extra money. As a matter of fact I returned this one and got the RF..."
3,"Base is good, wheels and handle need help","The overall design of the base is pretty good. Kids sit well, with two seats and small storage area under one of the seats. The handle is a little short. I am 6'2"" and the angle makes it very dificult to pull. Also, my back tires rub on the plastic (I think the axle was slightly short) and the wheels do not handle rough turrain very well. I am looking at other options and will likely pay a little more to get a longer handle and smoother ""drive-train."""
3,we didt got the rear axle,"dear sir we did not got de rear axle for that reasos is imposible use the car, pls could you tel me how can I get de rear axle Part?pls help me asap"
1,Noisy,"Wheels on this wagon are horrid! They are way too noisy. On grass it is good but on hard surfaces that are not smooth (such as gravel or cracked sidewalk, street, etc) it is load. It is too the point that I think hearing problems could arise if I took my kids on a ride each day. I am currently looking to replace these the wheels."
5,wagon & tagalong,"I bought this wagon & tagalong for my greatgrandsons . they love it . its easy to assemble,everything works just fine. i bought a second wagon for my friends two boys for xmas. love this wagon so do the children. great for the park or the sidewalk or the yard. the front wheels turn well, no trouble with the door opening.love this wagon.the tagalong is wonderful works good with the wagon . three kids can ride at once."
3,Step 2 Wagon for Two,"With great anticipation this was assembled and attached to the existing wagon and taken for a ride around the neighborhood. Before returning home, one of the wheels came undone and the two-year-old children had to walk the remainder of the blocks. Disappointing. Apparently the small cover for the nut holding the wheel to the wagon (axle?) came off as did the wheel. Would have been helpful if there were a couple of extra pieces included in the packaging to fix this."
5,Country with a PASSIONATE attitude!!!,"This up and coming star in the year 2000 offers a little of something for everyone who's curious about the new kid on the block...If you want to dance, want to jam, want to sway with your lady on the dance floor? You'll Love it! This style makes me feel like a kid all over again. I'm not going to miss out on this CD are you?"
2,Not My Style,"I love the 50s style dresses and clothes. I love wearing vintage outfits, with a modern twist here and there. When I saw these skirts, I got so excited.The item was shipped to me within three days. Great service.The skirt is really a lot more poufy than I was hoping for. It nips in at the waist, but then extends out so much that I ended up looking like Lili Taylor at the end of ""Dog Fight"". Not exactly the look I was going for.The skirt is also not hemmed at the bottom, which means it is strictly functional as a costume. It is not built or designed to be worn for normal activities.I sent an email to Hey Viv! this afternoon, looking for a return. It seems like a great company to order through, but this particular skirt is meant for costume and not wear."
5,Amazing!,This is a great quality skirt that looks great. I wasn't expecting it to be such heavy material but that only added to why I like it.
3,Deadly Encounter,"Someone please tell me why this DVD is priced well over $100? I handled the Extras for this movie here in the Tucson area. It was a fun movie to work on with the exception of the terrible accident that happened with the downed Helecopter in the Page,Arizona area. Larry Hagman was terrific to everyone. I recommend this movie but would hope that it can be found for a reasonable price."
5,THE GREAT BETRAYAL- EVACUATION OF THE JAPANESE-AMERICANS DUR,I HAVE BORROWED THIS BOOK FROM A FRIEND AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTRESTED IN HOW WE TREATED THE JAPANESE AMERICANS AND AM THRILLED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME WAY OF LEARNING MORE ASIDE FROM TALKING THE SOME NISEI AND SOMETIMES IT IS VERY HARD FOR THEM TO TALK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES THAT THEY ENCOUNTERED. I WANT TO ADD THIS BOOK TO MY LIBRARY AND POSSIBLE LEARN ENOUGH TO TEACH THE YOUNGER CHILDREN ABOUT THIS PART OF HISTORY THAT QUITE OFTEN IS OVERLOOKED.
1,Dud,"Don't waste your money on this one.I have Jochum on a Haydn mass/Orfeo label, superb.thought I'd try his Mozart mass.Mistake. There is nothing i like about this recording. The soloists are off key, sour, the solists amount to past their prime opera stars, This cd recorded 1977.Instead go with a 2 cd set on Royal Long players label conductede by Heinz Meyer Kundt/RSO Berlin. STUNNING 5++ stars on Mass 14!!! + other greatly recorded sacred Mozart.PaulJune 21, 2008"
1,Mine also failed,"I had my TV fail just under a year after I bought it (luckily I think I'm under warranty). Went to turn it on and snap, crackle pop it's not working at all except for a high pitched buzzing sound. Beware."
1,Poor shape and length for a child,"My 5 year old granddaughter couldn't stay on this board - it's too long and angular. Even her 25 year old uncle who is a semi-pro skateboarder from California found it an awkward shape. Giving it one star for the decorative appeal to young girls. Otherwise, it's a hazard."
4,Barbie skateboard,Bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter and she loved it. It has a rubberized grip top which keeps her feet from slipping off. She has had hours of fun with it.
4,AN EARLY FUSION CLASSIC,"Abercrombie & Hammer complement each other most excellently on this atmospheric, organ-driven release. LUNGS and RED & ORANGE are frantic call-and-response exercises that come to Mahavishnu-type climaxes while most of the others are more laid-back. Tastefully done. These two should get together more often."
4,"Yes, this is not your usual ECM album!","John Abercrombie's first album as leader, this was recorded in 1974 and released in 1975 (that's 25 years ago; the distributor is playing delete/reissue games!).He pairs up with Jan Hammer and Jack DeJohnette for a Mahavishnu-inspired set. A couple of the tracks are dead-ringers for the guitar/piano duets that appeared on ""Birds Of Fire"" and were so influential at the time. The rest is more original. There are a couple of fantastic long pieces - the atmospheric title track is one of my all-time favourite pieces.I have gotten much mileage out of this album over the years and would recommend it to any fans of these three. They got together ten years later and recorded ""Night"" (with Mike Brecker added) which is also good, but this is the one. I've docked it one star only for a lack of originality."
3,Solid Mid 70's Jazz Effort,"If this is the first John Abercrombie album you are going to buy, this is the wrong one. Start with the Gateway LP with Jack DeJohnette and Dave Holland. However, this is worth adding to your collection if you don't have it already."
5,Excellent Blade,"I have a 14"" Delta band saw with the six inch extension. I made the mistake of buying a 3/4"" wide blade for re-sawing when I purchased the band saw. All my reading and experience since has convinced me that the saw will not handle a blade that wide. I could not get the 3/4"" blade to track properly on both wheels at the same time, probably due to the excessive tension on the saw frame. I purchased 5/8"" and 1/2"" Olson blades, and the 5/8"" blade works great. I haven't tried the 1/2"" blade, but expect the same result. I normally wouldn't have included the 5/8"" review in the 1/2"" product area, but the blades appear identical except for width. In addition, the results were so good compared to the 3/4"" blade on my saw, that I wanted to let others know that using a blade less than 3/4"" on these 14"" saws makes a world of difference."
2,"So..so, kinda generic","If you like fusion, or bellydance with your own style mixed in that is not bellydance, its ok. Bellydance is an art form that in my opinion should not be mixed or played with. I dont like it when the dance form is distorted by fusion. So if you like the original bellydance moves, and real middle easter dance, this is not for you. But if you like to play around with this dance, its ok. For the price of $4 its ok."
4,Enjoyable and Informative!,"'The China Reader'offers a good selections of reading on Chinese culture, politics, education, media, economy and foreign relations in the post Mao era. Though some of the articles should prove useful in the long run, many of them will be hopelessly dated in a very short time (the fate of any book dealing with contemporary Chinese issues).Nevertheless, I found the book to be very interesting and useful in augmenting my understanding of current affairs in China. I particularly liked the articles in the chapter entitled `Society' that dealt with crime, the environment, and poverty and population issues.Schell and Shambaugh are `old China hands' and know their material well- so this book won't be disappointing for serious China watchers. I recommend it."
1,Same as Smart Shelfing & Storage,"I have the Smart Shelving and Storage Solutions book by Proulx and from looking at the Table of Contents of this ""new"" book on line at Amazon, I believe that many if not all of the projects in both books are identical or very similar. Most of the photos in the Table of Contents of Best of Danny Prolux Storage & Shelving are the same as the ones in Smart Shelving and Storage Solutions. I'm sorry that Mr. Proulx finds it necessary to reissue an old book under a slightly different title. I for one will buy a different book."

2,Too hard for what I need it for,I am going to Coratia for 2 weeks adn thought it would be nice to learn the basics. this book goes way to fast and is way to complicated for jsut that. If you want to become fluent in Croatian then this is it. Other wise don't bother with it
3,Thomas The Tank Engine Tool Box,"Hmm...didn't quite get the response from my 2 year old that I thought I would get. He plays with it.. but he wasn't WOWed by it.. I think the box is cute and nice size, has all the Thomas colors and pictures on it. Probably would have been better for an older child, at least 4 years or older."
1,Junk!!!!,"This is a piece of JUNK!! It would be a lot of fun except the screws stripped immediately in it so the box fell apart and no matter what you do, we have even glued the screws back in and it continues to break so it is now in the trash. It lasted a whole day....thats it!!! DO NOT BUY!!!"
3,fell apart but was fixable...,"Needs glue and more screws. Everything fell apart within a few minutes of use. The head came off the hammer, the heads came off the screws the screws came loose on the tool box and it also came apart. I glued everything and put some 1/4 longer screws in the tool box and put one on each end of the handle. If they are not going to put these together very well they should just ship them out as a kit to put together. BUT after fixing everything it seems to be my boys favorite toy for now."
3,Misleading,"I would have preferred an actual clay pot and I had to do a great deal of reading after receiving the item to see that it was ""a great alternative to clay or porcelain."" Please place some kind of disclaimer on the product information to prevent others from making the same mistake?"
2,1 song,"i bought this cd simply because the oldies buff that i am brought me to this new found blues singer,lovely version of gene chandler's ""god bless our love"" her other songs are smokin' too, i hope she does more oldies tunes!you go girl!"
5,Great Sermons here.,"I like to read her sermons after work in the evening, like a devotional thought. I highly recommend it for all."
5,"Bread of Angels, food for the soul","I love Barbara Brown Taylor's books...and especially enjoy reading her sermons as a part of my daily devotions. She is so down to earth, and expresses spiritual issues in memorable, visual, today concepts."
3,"can you say ""yawn""","This album could put an insomniac to sleep...In all fairness, this is an album that enables one to truly ""chill."" Honestly, I felt as though I had to check my pulse after listening to just 30 seconds of the album. This album is ideal to listen to after a difficult day at work etc., just don't listen to it while driving...Bill Laswell has a number of albums that I would recommend much more highly. These albums are: Radioaxiom ""A Dub Transmission"", Silent Recoil, and Sacred System."
1,info for new house is outdated,"In my opinion, the book is a waste of my time. It's recommendations for building a new house are outdated. Most of the no-no's they talk about aren't the way it is done now."

5,Wonderful!,"The book shipped quickly, even though it was in the middle of the Christmas rush. The book's condition was as discribed by the seller, which was wonderful!Great buy, great seller!"
5,"L.J.'s the best, I *love* all her books, this one's my fave!","Well, I'm not sure if it's my fave, I *love* them all so very much, but it's definitely one of my faves, I *love* James...he sounds so...sexy, I guess is the word. But this book has tons of detail, and I can imagine almost everything. And L.J. certainly does a great job with the other Night World books, I can't wait for Strange Fate to come out!"
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was reallly great. As soon as I read it, it came in first for ""best book"" in my mind. Phillip is so annoying, though! He always has to protect Poppy. I think it was cool that she turned out to be a Night Person anyway, so they weren't breaking a law after all! Excellent. E-mail me if you want to chat about LJS books."
5,Death of a Poppy,"I liked this book. Poppy is going to die and her best friend, who is also a vampire, comes to her rescue and turns her into a vampire. How much more romantic can you get? And I liked how she finds out she's a witch in the very end. Such a nice ironic twist."
4,a good book,"This is the only book i've read in this series, but I am a huge fan of L.J. Smith. This is a good book with excitement and romance. I love books with any supernatural element(witches, vampires, ghost, etc.). However in comparison with her other series like dark visions, and the secret circle, I didn't think it was nearly as good. I didn't get as involved in the characters. But for a quick read I would completley recommend trying this book"
5,The Night World (ALL OF THEM),"I have read all of the books in the night world and they are the best. I really liked huntress, i think that Jez was rally good. i also liked soulmate, my fav one in that book was maya. The only one that i haven't read out of the night world is Strange Fate, number 10. I cant wait untill it comes out. it should tell us what happens with the four wild powers, and if the vampiers take over or not...."
3,A Good introduction to the Night World but not Smith's best,"The book itself drew me into the Night World seris( and later to the Forbidden Game; a must read!)but having read the entier seris up to book nine I believe it does no tdo the Night World seris itself credit. The character Poppy, a girl dying who's only chance to live is to become one of the undead, put me off( epesically when she calls herself a sex pixie) but the novel is saved by the character Ash ( who makes quite a few apperances throughout the seris) Basically, if it wasn't for Ash I would never have bothered to read book 2 Daughters of Darkness."
5,this book ruled.,"the secret vampire was about a girl named popy north who in thebook finds out that she has cancer and will die in a few mounths . Butwhat she dose not know is that her best friend James Rasmussen is a vampire . and when he finds out that she is dieing he does every thing in his power to save her from death , including changing her into a vampire . END"
5,The saddest of them all !,"This was actually the 1 st ever Night World books I have ever read and I did not really want to get it as it was rather expensive-I bought it in France, but BOY am I glad I did buy it at the end! It is about these two best friends Poppy and James who are both in love with each others, even though James does not know it as he will die. Then Poppy gets cancer and James is worried and finds out he does love her so in order for her to live he must change her into a vampire but things are not so easy, and can she survive through the consequences?I am now a great Lisa Jane Smith fan and if anyone is also looking for a soulmate-please do not hesitate to e mail me"
3,Read-able,"This is a good book for teenagers. I found the characters a bit shallow and story a little predictable. For me the romance has to make me want to read the next chapter and, sadly, it wasn't happening for me. Never-the-less, it is good if you want something easy to read on a cold winter's day."
2,Twilight for tweens,"Sort of Twilight for tweens. Not any where near as good, but a similarchaste vampire romance without any gore. A bit immature in terms oftone. If Twilight if for seventeen year olds, Night World is fortwelve year olds."
2,rather typical,"Hm....Me, I found this unrealisticaly writen, predictable, and a bit out of place. It's been a while since I've read it, so I cannot give examples, but I remeber that this tale inflicted little fear, uderstanding, compasion, or any other emotion what so ever besides perhaps amusement..sorry!"
5,my first,"this book was the first book that i have ever read of the night world series. this book is about a girl, poppy, who gets cancer. then her best friend and secret love, james, offers her a chance to live. but to live, she must become a vampire. the rest, you'll have to read. myself, i don't like it when people who write online reviews spill the beans about the ending. after this book, i was hooked onto l.j. smith's books. im sure you will too. :)"
4,good...but I've read better,"I like this series just fine, the plots are actually pretty good but there's something about these books that just doesn't quite click. The stories are somethimes totally cheesy and the characters are quite weak but I can't help liking them. My pack and I agree that this is the best out of the series, but we are dedicated to another...The Anita Blakes. If anyone wants a good read and doesn't mind a little blood..., those are you books."
1,Buyer Beware of this fountain,"It was a nice idea and the large black bowl makes an attractive centerpiece but soothing, comforting it is not. In operation, the floating chimes miss 4 out of 6 stationary chimes producing a monotonous, high pitched tone. The floating chimes can get stuck as they travel around the bowl. Not a nice feature unless you like having to jump up to free them. For the price, it is just not a quality product. Yankee's Customer Service is not sympathetic to the product's flaws. They just offer to replace it with another ill-designed unit. Save yourself the trouble and buy elsewhere. There are plenty of decent fountains that do work as promised even if they don't chime."
2,Nice Frowntain : (,"I opted for the cheaper black fountain rather than the copper one. Same experience with the floating chimes getting stuck and the chimes are kinda loud. We have ours in a larger foyer, but often the chiming disrupts TV watching etc, so I actually just took them out. I'm happy with the end result eventhough I wished the product did work. So I guess I'll wait for the prosperity to kick in to off set the cost : )"
2,Because it doesn't know where to go...,"Having never read a J.C. Oates book, I used the Amazon reviews to select this book. I loved the premise of the book and found the writing and the character development to be excellent. Oates paints a gloomy and believable picture of life in a small, depressed town in the 1950's.While the book lived up to its promise in the first half of the novel, it degenerated badly once Iris leaves Hammond. Oates wants to maintain a connection between Iris and Jinx, but she has to stretch very hard to keep it alive. (I felt that it didn't work at all.)The compelling story lost its punch. I kept expecting a powerful denouement, but instead found myself scoffing at the circumstances surrounding the assault scene on the night of Kennedy's assassination.I'm sure I'll try another Oates novel in the future. I only hope it hangs together better than this one."
2,Bitter and Boring,"I started reading this book hoping for the best. In turn, I found that my hopes weren't fulfilled. The beginning half was intriguing and kept me wanting more. After the tone changed, the book became bitter and boring. The characters lost their flare, and the whole book lost personality. The book became dull and lost appeal to me. The book's writing style, in the beginning, was original and fun. Following the death of Little Red the book slowly fell apart, leaving me tempted to stop reading the book. If someone asked me to recommend a good book, this would not be the one."
3,Why no mention of Stephen Crane on jacket or in book anywher,"This book was ok. I bought it because the title was a direct quote from a stephen crane poem. Why no attribution anywhere to crane?I guarantee less than 1% of Americans could attribute the quote. If you search the web now on ""Because is is bitter.."" you'll get Joyce Carol Oats 90% of the time. BOGUS. She robs Crane and gets away with it."
3,Bittersweet and Watered Down,"Having never read any book other than this by Joyce Carol Oates, I was very optimistic. The book pulled me in when the characters started to develop. As I read on about Iris and Jinx's little secret love the book. I love the concept. though Persia and Duke were slightly bizarre, they were completely fun to read. The book lacked substance as soon as the murder occurred. The second half beacme more and more watered down as Oates tried to keep the relationship between Iris and Jinx rolling. Overall, this book was worth my while. I recommend."
2,"Good Idea, not so good a book","Because It Is Bitter and Because it is My Heart was a book with a good idea and theme, but I found it not well written or thought out. Oates defines all characters as either good or bad, and most are bad. In the first section of the book, Oates jumps around too much and there are few clues as to when the events were happening. The book portrayed the fifties as an awful time in America and that people were almost all bad and that there was no justice. If Oates would have stuck to the theme instead of going off on other little side themes, it had the potential to be a good book. I would not recommend it, unless you are an advanced reader."
5,The Picasso of Poetry,"Having glanced at his work in the past, I didn't think I'd like Cummings' work at all. It seemed 'pastiche poetry', pretty words smattered all over a page with no connecting thread. I couldn't have been further from the truth; even his shortest pieces (""I Am Going To Utter A Tree.."") Cummings sometimes archiac style is unmistakably his own. Some of his ""Unrealities"" blend poetic word salads with ingenious covert metaphor: (""be these haunters of dreams always demurely half smiling from cool faces.."") Cummings outdoes the beats with his crazed verbal exhortations to life. Simply reading or glancing at a few pages of his work makes one want to write. Above all, he is fun and certainly beyond imitation."
1,Weak,This rack fell apart less than 24 hours after hanging my clothes on it. The plastic is not strong enough to hold clothes on both racks.
4,"Before you read, heed these words.....","If your are turning to this book as an account on the life of Tupac Shakur you are dead wrong from the beginning. This book is about Afeni. From the beginning you are told that the book is based solely off the conversations that Jasmine Guy had with Afeni, conversations that are between friends. Everyone has a different account of their own life, this book is life as Afeni sees it and how she wants to tell it. How truthful is it, I'm not going to dig deep into that because I read this book to find out more about HER and about HER mindset and about how SHE sees things. This isnt a history lesson which demands the burden of proof and fact in order for it to be called history. Read this book if you want to know about AFENI the woman. If not then I suggest you pass on it."
4,Tupac's Foundation,This book really helps you to understand the multiple layers that engulfed the late Tupac Shakur. Jasmine Guy gave Afeni (Tupac's mother) a platform to freely and naturally tell her story to the world. A must read for anyone that is having trouble understanding the personal dilemmas of one of the greatest rappers of all time. I only wish Tupac would have lived long enough to find the peace that Afeni has finally discovered.Thanks Jasmine Guy for spreading your artistic wings!
5,A Book That Everyone Should Read,"There is something very genuine about this story and those telling it. Everyone could learn something valuable from this book because it touches on many points vital to one's survival and evolution. It not only tells the story of one women, it taps into the heart of humanity."
1,Do not buy this CD !!!!1,Aorta - Blood........ While this groups first album of the late 60's wasgreat ..... this one sounds like a group of very poor musicians tryingto copy Frank Zappa's style. It was a complete waste of money andnot worthy of your time!
3,Surprised- It broke coming out of the package!,"A friend and long time customer asked if I could even find this exact brand and tool for him. I had not heard of it before. Sadly, although it looked fine and in a perfect package, one of the prongs broke off as he was removing it from the packaging. It is a specialty tool with thin metal prongs.Maybe a small box and some bubble wrap would be better than vacumn packaging it so hard to the cardboard? If you buy it, you may want to use a sharp razor blade to extract it from the plastic vacumn packing.I did not contact the company back for a replacement, because really,what are they going to say? Please, use extreme care in cutting it out of the packaging."
4,this tool works,this tool works and is fairly easy to use. and seems to be well made I would buy it again.
5,Great Chair,This is a very comfortable chair. It is large enough for even heavier people. Just check and make sure it's got both the rockers on it when you get it. Mine was crushed in process of transporting it.
5,Trailer for Step 2 Wagon,"I purchased this trailer for my Step 2 wagon. I take my grandchildren on big ventures in the community where I live. There are lots of trail systems where I live. When we leave my house we can be gone for 3-4 hours at a time. I purchased the trailer to store snacks, diapers, a cooler or whatever else we might need when we are out. I don't like storing too much in the wagon because I want them to have plenty of room for their feet, etc. I'm very happy with it."
4,"Fun, but color is off.","I just finished putting the trailer portion together. It was pretty easy except for attaching it to the wagon. I'm sure my husband would have been able to attach it to the wagon without any problems, but I had to really muscle it. The thing that bugs me is the color. I bought the wagon from Amazon 3 months ago and it has only been used outside once. The trailer is a much brighter shade of green than the wagon. I had expected them to be comparable to look like one unit but there is a definite color difference."
4,we really like our wagon trailer,"We really like the wagon trailer. As a mother of b/g 22 month twins, it gets used alot. We even take it to Menards and Home Depot. They love to be in their wagon and the trailer allows me to take them by myself. I just put my purse and diaper bag or toys in the trailer and off we go.One thing. The directions to attaching this thing SUCK!! My husband and I struggled to get it together. We ended up throwing the directions away and figuring it out on our own. I am not going to lie we cussed trying to get that thing together!"
4,Good house fun,"This album is fun and I enjoy it. There are a few songs that are only album fillers, but you expect that from every album. Some good songs include: Just a little more love, Time, and Open your Eyes. If you like dance music/ house with a good amount of melody and singing, this is your album."
2,Only if you like pictures,"This phone has great picture and video capacity as well as techincal capablities but if you are looking for reception, look somewhere else. I have had two Samsungs in the past and was very happy with them. I am very unhappy with this purchase. I am no longer able to get reception from my home and have had many more dropped calls with this model. The small screen on the front of the phone is difficult to read as it flashes the number of incomings. It does not display missed calls, voicemails etc on front of phone. You must open phone to check from mail, messages, etc.. Button on the side of the phone are difficult to manage. There is no comfortable place to put your fingers when holding the phone without hitting the speaker or volume buttons. Just picking the phone up or putting it in your pocket often turns on the speaker phone status."
4,OLD STUFF,"i don't care what anyone says about flip phones, but i'm fine with this one, I had this same phone for about 5 years, until it finally gave up on me, but I still like this one, the speakers loud...recording is fine and i'm fine"
3,Battery is temperamental,"This phone is okay but at least once a month, I will fully charge it and then have it die a few hours later. This especially seems to happen when roaming. Disappointing."
1,suckest phone,"I have the first one which key pad can not reconize when I dial the number, the 2nd replacement ever worse, the battery go off in 1 day, I called Amazon cell phone dept to get a new phone and this time they refused to replace due to already past the 30 days, now I am stuck in 2 year contract and need to buy a new phone with retail price. Verizon also is one of the suck cell phone provider due to they don;t have GSM card, so each time, when you change the new phone, you need to reactive the phone and it is not convenience if you go oversea"
3,salt,"it came late because there was a hole in it but the salt when it did arrive was good. i think it is a good product and it has worked well this winter for me. it really has done its job in stopping the ice when i put it down,"
5,"If Bernard had started a cult, I'd join...","I'm an unashamed Moitessier fan. Buy this book if you're a sailor, a dreamer, or a Francophile.""The Long Way"" is his best, in my view, but this one will round out your collection."
4,One of the best movies.,"This vid was a really good movie. Though it wasn't as good as worlds strongest, it still rokked. If I could i would of given ita 4 and a half star rating because the action was really good. the plot was really interesting, and u could really follow along with the storyline easily. the only thing i disliked about is that there trying to be funnyall through the movie, though most people dont care for dbz's comedy, and just want to see peoples back sides kicked. also, they toned down the fighting so that younger audiences could enjoy the movie too, but personally, i think dbz should be for teenz and up. basically if u were a dbz fan u should definatly get this title, cos it is entertaining enough to suit older fans and younger fanz. if ur not much of a db fan, u should rent it first."
5,Great continuation of the DBZ story. Excellent!,"Terliss, Piccolo, Gohan and the Great Goku face off in a great battle!! Awesome!!"
4,A must see for all dragon ball fans,"You must be crazy to miss this one, it has a very good story line and you get a deminstation of everyones spiecal power.Sow you must see this one of a kind movie."
5,DRAGON BALL Z does it again!!,For anyone who has seen the dragonball series or any of the movies knows what I am talking about this is A MUST SEE AND A MUST BUY!
4,Turlis,i think it was a pretty good movie not that much action. and for every one who is spelling it like turles and taurus it is Turlis!
4,Pretty good,"I think this is an incredible movie, exelent story, but I think that the fights were very shorts and the movie is very good but I loved it any way"
4,This is one of the best Dragon Ball Z movies there are...,"This movie has I think,one of the best characters,has a very good fight in it,and has a better variety of characters in it than most do.Althought the storylines slakes a bit,the characters and fights make up for it."
4,Well worth the purchase...,"Toonami edited quite a bit compared to this DVD. I noticed one major edit in the ""first scene"" alone, where Krillan and Gohan search for the Dragon Balls to summon the Dragon (In the Toonami version, the two just have an extra wish laying around).The uncut edition is excellent. The menu is simple. The DBZ Quiz is entertaining. The Character Bios are informative. And best of all, this DVD provides short trailers for several other DBZ Home Videos.Very well put together."
3,"Good action, but not the best","This is a pretty good DBZ movie with *some* neat action, but it's not the best. The story doesn't make any sense. It involves an unknown Saiya-jin who looks just like Goku for no reason and we never get an explanation as to why he survived the destruction of Panet Vegeta. Furthermore, he uses the ""ball of light"" trick to make Gohan change to Oozaru(Were-ape), but he himself doesn't change. Then when he destroys the energy ball, Gohan doesn't change back. Finally, when everything is over, there's this giant dead tree clinging to Earth, and nobody ever explains how they get rid of it. Plus, this is one of the movies where everybody good keeps getting trashed the entire time, but Goku inexplicably manages to beat the bad guy with one desperate move. Not very satisfying. I'd reccomend either ""The World's Strongest"" or movies 5 & 6 when they are released in the US."
4,Dragon ball is tight fast with a lot of suspence,Japan has the best animation in the world. No contest. The imagination and no holds barred graphics an story lines make almost every anime I've ever seen intence.Especially dragon ball. The suspence will take you from show to show. Even it you have to pay for it.
5,cool action.,incredible a good action movie.if you like action see this.all the people almost die in this one everyone exepet chichi.the action scens are exelent the fighting scense greatttttttt.goku must save the earth and his friends and gohan.the est dbz movie ever nothing happens at first till goku hers about the tree and goes and fights the pirates and save his friends from them.then save gohan from turlas.finaly after being mad about what turles did to his friends and gohan.he fights him.and a great battle see this dbz movie its good.
4,Good Story,"A few warriors from another planet plant a tree that sucks the nutrients from earth in order to grow fruit. The fruit is intended for the eternal dragon, but if a warrior was to eat it would make the warrior extremely strong. The move is the battle of the good guys against the bad guys in order to save the earth. To find out the ending and the other stuff I skipped, go see the movie, I reccomend it!"
5,Great Movie!,This is the best DBZ movie yet.The fights were at there finest and the story line was very clever.I would recomend this movie to DBZ fans of all ages.Go rent it today!
4,DBZ...so-so but Goku and Krillin are DA BOMB!,Pokemon watch out...DBZ empire gonna strike back at you soon!
4,My Favorite Dragonball Z Movie,"This movie has a good plot and its story appeals to people who have never even seen the anime or manga. The only problem is that the story speeds through scenes that should be longer,such as when the ""good guys"" are gathered at Goku's/Chi-chi's house, and drags out others.I love the Dragonball/Z/GT television shows and this movie is like watching a long episode. I give it three thumbs up."
3,Hyped,The movie followed along the Dragonball Z theme. Evil does wants to destroy earth. Goku and friends fights ever one falls even Goku but he doesn't stay down. Goku saves the day. The movie is good don't get me wrong I just wished there was more fighting.
2,Is this some kind of joke?,"I would just like to say that someone who had never seen or heard of Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z could have made a better Dragon Ball movie than this. A flying dragon? Give me a break! The only remotely good thing about this movie was Turlace. Excuse me, but anyone stupid enough to be entertained by a tree destroying the Earth does not deserve the pleasure of being a Dragon Ball fan! If you want some real action, get Dead Zone! That's a real Dragon Ball movie!"
4,This one was a little off...but I still think its a good read,"I was so excited to finally see that this book had been released and I purchased it and took it home and read. Helen's character of long suffering caretaker to her uncaring brother and how she deals with the unbelievable wager that was made with her virtue, I really thought her character was handled very well. As for Luke, I just try and remember this is fiction, so in fiction, your leading man, need not be 'perfect' and hey if your that handsome, you are give quite a bit of leeway. I'm very happy with how the book ended and I can't wait for Ms. Holt's next book."
3,Interesting but slow,"From the reviews I expected it to be a little more indepth, the story line was little slow. You have all this sexual tenison and teasing until almost the middle of the book. It was a relief for main characters to finally get together. What was funny to me was the secondary characters were together before any of the others. But it is a interesting book and the 1st one I have purchased from this author. Its not the best exotic romance I have read, but its not the worse. You be the judge."
1,Didn't care for this one,"I used to really enjoy Cheryl Holt's books, but skip this one and save your money. I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters, and the sex seems to be totally lacking any romance. She phoned this one in."
3,Okay Book!,I have read most of Cheryl Holt books. But unfortunately they are starting to feel too similar in storyline. Girl in unfortunate situation gets involve with Rake. Not my fave of her work but okay enough.
2,From loathing to love in record time.,"I have read everything Holt has written but have been let down by her last two novels. I love a good erotic read as much as the next, however, there needs to be some redeeming qualities in the leads. The heroine went from loathing the hero to loving him within the first few chapters. The hero, was not far behind.I felt no build-up at all and their love was not at all convincing. They were in love because the author *tells* us they are. I was left scratching my head in wonder how this man who was so disreputable fell in love and lust so quickly. I ended up stopping halfway through in frustration as I could see where the predictable plot was going.I recommend *Love Lessons* and *Total Surrender* for spicy Cheryl Holt reads."
1,pathetic - don't waste your $,"I can't say a single good thing about this book. The love story was trite, boring, and extremely THIN. It was not romantic, not sexy, not hot, not even erotic - it was pitiful. The plot didn't go anywhere. The lead characters lacked any interesting character traits. Most of the time they are not even in the same area code. This book is a clear case of an author capitalizing on previous successes to sell a poorly written, rushed novel of no value to readers. AVOID!"
2,The locking mechanism broke after one month of use,"What can I say? The Installation is not easy, you should use a ladder and a drill to mount the lock. If you are a person of less than 6 feet you can not open the door. The main problem is that the mechanism was broken after a month of use. Now I have to buy a different one."
2,drilling required,"you definitely need to do a lot of drilling!..but these seem like they'll work great for security..and they are not white..more off white..but i'll put up a curtain over them or paint to hide the color.Edit after 6 months of use...This lock was working great, but one day I pulled it to open and it snapped and the ceramic piece broke in half. So now I need to order or a new one or have 4 holes drilled in my patio door. I'm dropping this to a 2 star now because it did not last 6 months."
3,Not a universal product!,"We ordered this product because it was the only one that we could find that allowed you to have the door open a little bit, and it was aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, it didn't work with our door. The flat piece that attaches to the top of the door jam was too thick, preventing the door from opening. Sadly we will not be able to use this product."
1,No drilling? Nonsense,The product description states that no drilling is required. Tools required? Power drill. Holes to drill? Three. I would have wanted to know that before I purchased this product.
4,Door Lock,"Needed an extra lock to prevent my 2 yr old from going out on the deck by himself. Very easy to install, took 10 minutes max. Works great,although when the lock is placed in the second hole to allow 3 inch ventilation, it can be just slid into the locked position so you'll need to watch for little fingers that like to close the door by themselves. Overall good product."
5,Patio Door Lock Review,"This child lock door system is wonderful! My 3 year old was constantly getting outside on her own, and now she can't. The lock is a very good sturdy construction and I recommend it to anyone with small children, or anyone who wants a good lock on a sliding door."
5,Special Needs Child,We have 5 sliding doors and a special needs child (who is 12) that recently figured out how to move the stick and open the door. We wanted to make sure that the doors were more secure for his safety and the safety of our little ones.We like this because he cannot yet reach it to open it and we think it will take him some time to figure it out. It is easy enough that my 11 year old can do it ( standing on a chair) but complicated enough that my little ones can't. I like the fact that if we are all in the yard you can set the door guradian to stay unlocked but also if we are walking out to leave that the guardian will lock behind you. So that the sitter doesn't need to be concerned. This is a great fix for these doors. Would recomend to anyone with a special needs child or little ones.
1,Crappy Instructions,Bad instructions. A pain to install. I wanted something easier that wouldn't break and keep the kids in. Try this instead:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCWR06/ref=oh_details_o03_s04_i07
4,"Installation a bit tricky, but it works","I bought this to keep my 2-year-old in the house. Because of how my sliding glass door is built, I was not able to put all the screws in the part that goes on the actual door, but it still works. I would buy it again."
3,DRILLING REQUIRED!,"Despite the description stating that there is no drilling required, the first tool listed in the instructions as necessary to complete installation: a drill! And no question you will need it. Putting that aside, this is a well made lock and works once it is installed. Just be careful if you have a tall door; my wife cannot reach the mechanism without a step stool."
5,Awesome!,This is a great DVD showing the best team in the NHL win the Stanley Cup. Ron Francis brought us credibility. Glen Wesley gave us stability. Eric Staal may be our biggest star. But Rod Brind'Amour is the Carolina Hurricanes!
4,Good for the collection of a Canes fan.,"I was hoping for a little more footage on it, gave it as a gift to a friend. A good collection of clips and commentary, nice special features... I just wish it had a full game on it as well."
4,Great Production,All of the Stanley Cup series of DVD's are very nicely put together and have some great behind-the-scenes commentary. I'm a Hartford Whalers fan from way back and they did have a bit of Whalers nation in there with a nice retirement ceremony for one of the Whaler greats...even though they put him in a Carolina jersey. :)Nice DVD and ya can't beat the price!!
4,Yes a Glynnis CD great!!,After enjoying the voices of Sarah Kerrigan and the rogue this CD or what i've heared of it captures Glynnis' amazing voice. Will she send me a personel message?
4,NICELY DONE,"A compilation of about ten gospel videos from the likes of Rickey Dillard, Rance Allen, Detrick Hammond. Not bad for the price. Good to see a bit of a Clark Sisters Reunion."
2,"Tasted good, but didn't do the trick","In all fairness, I had strep throat which is pretty hard to numb out, particularly when it's exacerbated by a persistent cough. While these lozenges did taste good, they just didn't do the trick for me.Rebecca Kyle, January 2009"
2,Do not wastte your time,"Some humor like Larry the cable guy,but not the basics of Germanism. author with an agenda? Naw, but this is not schoalarship"
4,great but used to be better,it really is too bad amazon does not have this item in stock but fortunately its carried at target stores for 3.oo a jar. now my only complaint is that the sodium content over the years has shot up from 30mg a serving to 120mg. the shelf life did increase though and the oil no longer separates as it did while not preserved by salt. i have ordered from the sunbutter website in the past but the shipping costs drastically increased the overal price. so 'til amazon stocks these i will continue going to target. if looking for low sodium try the organic sunbutter but be warned it is very tasteless and soupy. all and all it is a very good tasting substitute for peanut butter and if only the sodium were reduced a bit i would give it five stars.
1,Not worth the price!,I cut about ten pieces of oak and the blade had already began to dull. For the price this blade should have held up longer than this. Price doesn't mean anything anymore. After several more cuts in soft cedar the blade breaks. Not only are these blades not worth the price they are a P.O.S.. Buyers be aware!
4,LOVE HOTEL ENCOUNTERS,"Kaoru and Tina end up going to the zoo on their own, but due to a violent rainstorm, they miss their train to get back home. To pass the time, they enter a place called Animour, thinking that its a karaoke and arcade. To their surprise, they find out that it's really a love hotel! What will Aoi think of Kaoru if she finds out they stayed overnight there? On top of this, the spoiled rich girl, Mayu, gets a job as a maid in Aoi's house to learn how to cook for her future husband, Kaoru!As usual, Ai Yori Aoshi continues its charming tale of love with a lot of humor inflected into it. With the addition of Mayu into the Aoi household, this series is dangerously close to entering Love Hina harem comedy. It would be unfortunate if it continues down that road."
1,WRONG REFERENCIAL PHOTO,"I bought this item and didn't take care of what it really was, just the ""TOP"" of the air filter, the referencial photo shows a whole air filter with the element.please mention this."
1,"Little Content, Little Value",The value that this book has is probably due to the fact that you can carry around some of the most important documents in human history. It's just such a shame that I can do that better and for free using the Internet.
3,Full arrangements seem to muck it up,"I ordered this along with an acoustic album by Colin Hay, ""Going Somewhere"". I listed to ""Going Somewhere"" first, and was mesmerized by its lovely acoustic vocals and guitar, which really let the songwriting shine. Then I popped in ""Are You Looking at Me?"" expecting more of the same. I was surprised to hear full arrangements on this album, but listened attentively to see if I was struck again by the songwriting and performance. I really wasn't. I feel the arrangements/production choices on several of the tracks contain distracting sounds or background vocals, and that they really take the focus away from the songwriting. Having recently discovered Colin's solo work, and read some about his love of songwriting, I have a genuine respect for him. So I certainly don't want to take anything away from him. But listeners who enjoyed his acoustic work should know that this album is very different, and in my opinion - not in a good way."
4,I bought myself new glasses...,"Such a great CD. I came to know Colin Hay the solo artist via his song on the Garden State soundtrack. Then I picked up Man @ Work and Going Somewhere and have since become a huge fan of his work.This album took a bit to grow on me and once it did, I couldn't stop listening to it. I think my favorite song is ""Lonely Without You"" but honestly, there's not one song on this CD that I skip past. It's a great listen from top to bottom and one of those CDs that you can have on in the background as you're chilling out or blaring through your speakers as you head out out of Hollywood and drive into the hills."
5,another great one!,Colin Hay is my absolute favorite artist. I have seen him twice and will see him again tomorrow. I was waiting for this CD to come out and it was definitly worth the wait. His music is excellent and his live performances are terrific. Another great CD!
5,ONE OF THE BEST IN A FIRST CLASS DISCOGRAPHY,"This is a great album all the way around. I would compare the laid back acoustic sets to ""Man At Work"". These songs are all new and original though. The lyrics are deep and meaningful, the music classic and the sound pristine. Highly recommended to all Colin Hay fans and highly recommend to all that have yet to discover his genius and charm."
3,Into the Water,A very sad time for the citizens of both Spotsylvania and King George Counties. This crime struck too close to home. God bless the young woman in South Carolina that had the mindset to escape and return with local law enforcement. It is too bad the coward that did this sentenced himself to death. Hard to say how many others were affected.
3,lots of typos on the kindle version,this is the first true crime book that i have read. it's interesting how law enforcement investigates cases. but there are so many typos. at least one on each page.
1,Tedious,"This is the first book I've read by Fanning, and I doubt I'll be interested in others. I love true crime when well written. But this story should have been merely one episode in a compilation of tales. The man's a monster, and his victims pathetic, but the facts are thin. Fanning pads the book with tedious detail and overdramatic flourishes. I always ""recycle"" my paperbacks by handing them on to others, but this one will go in the wastebasket."
3,A Good Book In General,"""Into The Water"" is the horrifying, true story of a case that haunted Virginia for years. When Sofia, Kristin and Kati were murdered, and months turned to year with no break in the case, people wondered if it would ever be solved. In 2002 Virgnians got the news they longed to hear: Spotsylvania slayings solved! It was solved because of one brave girl who escaped the killer. While I firmly believe Spotsylvania authorities, such as Howard, did their best to find the killer, it all comes down to the fact that Kara's courage brought down this monster. If you are from Virginia, especially the Spotsylvania area, this book is not really worth reading since it is basically everything that was in the newspapers. However if you aren't familiar with this case, you must read this book. And out of honor and respect for Sofia, Kristin and Kati, I believe after reading the book people should donate to a missing child organization. Just my two cents."
2,Skip this book,The events described in this book are both disturbing and tragic. The author's style is also equally disturbing. This book seems to be filled with useless facts that are loosely connected to the main story. Towards the end of the book I resorted to skimming paragraphs and pages that were boring and obviously not worth reading. If anyone is interested in this case I would recommend performing a Google search as an alternative to reading this book.
1,BORING!,"I love Diane Fanning's Written in Blood, but this one was a real stinker. You know the ending before it begins, there is only speculation as to what happened. I found myself skimming over the pages at the end hoping for something interesting. I do not like to give negative reviews, but this was horrible. I have read many true crime books and this was one of the worst. Her other books are far superior."
2,What you see is not what you get,"What you see in the description photo is a stern light with a black plastic cap over the clear lens to stop upward glare. Good idea for a small boat. What you actually receive is a one piece cap with the clear plastic on top (where the black plastic is in the photo) fogged, as if with a sandblaster. This doesn't work nearly as well.It appears that Perko cheapened the design while keeping the advertising photo for the earlier and much more effective design. Other than that large issue, this light works as designed."
4,Good book by Great Architect,Learn the thoughts and design beliefs of one of the great golf course architects. After reading the book you then can see his hand print on Augusta National.
5,Important Read,A must book for the reader who likes to read the deeper meaning of our innermost self. This is a great Bible based book.
5,muy buenos,"excelente zapatos se recomienda ampliamente la compra de los zapatos misma calidad que se observa en la foto, la talla correspondiente"
2,Too theoretical,"I can't say this is a bad book, but only that it was beyond my comprehension. I was hoping for something a little lighter. I spent some time in Wiesbaden and Kaiserslautern, Germany and learned some of the ways they contort the language. I thought this book might be a humorous reminder of my experiences. Nonetheless even after several tries I can not map the author's descriptions to my experiences. I think this book is written for linguists rather than for students of German who might just want a taste of the various dialects."
1,avoid,"For anyone thinking of buying this , DON'T !!! It's a horrible record with no soul. I met this singer once and she was a total con with her phony attitude . This is like the start of the whole Spice Girls , Britney , Christina , Jessica era of pop music that killed the music business AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!"
3,hyungirl's review on Buddy Holly's Crickets CD,"Medley-Doin' like Elvis (Good Luck Charm & She's not you) can be of value for anyone who wants to consider building a career as an Elvis impersonator. As a whole, this CD may entertain some Elvis collectors rather than serious Buddy Holly fans."
2,Don't !,I saw this title at Amazon and it was ranked highly. So I put up the cash... I am still amazed at how many pages can be written to say so little ! The only thing I found in the first 11 chapters is that I can do only basic animations without Lingo. There are only a few screenshots . The first example (Romeo And Juliet) - There is no mention that the file is actually on the CD. The CD itself is full of DEMOS - of which almost none is related to Director!! not even to Macromedia ! so why bother ? There are lengthy descriptions of ideas that can be summed in a couple of lines !! The order is very confused - I am still not sure in what chapter the book really starts. There are no helpful (real life) tips -I still haven't learnt anything that I could not read in the manual or the helpfile -I am all too dissappointed and I have lots of things to say about this book - but I am tired now !...
3,Not for the Beginner!,"The book claims it is for beginners--not so. Especially if you are looking for a step by step approach. It comes with a CD, but I am still looking for the ""How to use the CD with this book"" instructions. More than half of the book is devoted to examples of lingo--not for the novice Director user!"
3,Nice overview- little depth,"Overall I'd have to say that I'm pretty disappointed with this book. At best it serves as an overview of Director and Lingo but it lacks in delivering much real content of value. If you are brand spanking new to Director/Lingo then use this book as an introduction, but if you're ready to get down and dirty I'd suggest seeking out another text."
3,yes - but where do you put the scripts!,I am a newbie and proud of it. I wanted a book that could give me the understanding of Lingo that I needed. And this book looked like a good choice to me. Untill I wanted to try out the code myself. RosenZweig.... where do I put your scripts??? It doesn't help teaching us Lingo when you do not show us where to put the code. Thanks a lot.
4,Yankee Tie,"The item was a good item. The order processing time was to slow and therefore the item did not reach me in time for the event I had planned. I thought of returning the item, but decided to keep it for future use."
3,not the best,this is not the best charmed book as i found it a bit dull and predictable in places but if you are a major charmed fan it's still good to read as it links in more with the series than previous books
2,It was....O.K...,The book was great...To start with.The ending was predictable and ruined the whole book.It was written well but it was just the terrible ending.The charmed books are all good and this definately wasn't the worst one.
4,Gypsy Enchantment,"Gypsy Enchantment is a good book. Not exactly great and has only one plot twist that you could not even guess. There's a thing about circuses that makes Prue hate them and she is very disapointed when she is assigned to photograph the event. So sad that she didn't even put up a decent fight when Piper and Phoebe wanted to tag along. Well surprise, surprise! It's Prue's turn to fall in love with a gypsy violinist that can tame the wildest creature with his music. But there is a strange rumor circulating the circus about Ivan, the violinist. He is cursed. And when Phoebe gets a bad preminition about him they freak. Who is the bad guy? It's so surreal!"
5,The best cartoon ever !!!! I love it and I highly recomend it,"Pinky and the brain are very fun to watch. They are a perfect couple, one smart and the other insane and very funny. The chemistry between this caracters is hilarious and even though they don't have the same objetives in life, they are united for something very special... they are the best friends!!!In addition to all this fun and sarcastics comments, you'll get to know some good information about the World, its history and fun facts about politics."
4,"Pinky and The Brain, Vol.1","I think I enjoyed this series better as a child. Rewatching it again, yes, I get some of the jokes, but some of them are completely lost on me, while, when younger, it was the childish jokes that really set me off. Now, the series just seems flat. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments (Pinky's letter to Santa had me bawling), but the way I see it, Pinky and the Brain has two stages of enjoyment: A stage where all the jokes fly over your head, and it's the situational humor that makes you laugh, primarily kids, and the stage where it's the secondary humor, the ""inside jokes"" almost, with all the references, are what brings the funny. I guess I'm somewhere in the middle of that age range, where the jokes don't make sense, since they are aimed at people who were adults/teens at the time I was a kid, and the kid stuff just isn't funny anymore.So, highly recommended for those two groups, but everyone else, you might just want to go for Animaniacs instead?"
5,Cartoon genius,"For anyone who loves cartoons, this one is hilarious. Brain, the mouse who wants to take over the world always get thwarted by his trusty sidekick, Pinky. All the adventures and plans for taking over the world is pure funny stuff, and Pinky's famous catchphrase, ""Narff"", just makes you want to laugh. Really good for young kids to watch and laugh with. Join in each episode for the two mice who want to take over the world. Narff!!"
3,great comedy,this gift came along with others for Christmas and I wasn't dissappointed. It's nice to not worry about sound or picture quality.
3,good,"Haven't watched it but it's a good show. the box was pretty screwed up when i got it, and it was supposed to be new, but whatever. i was going to use it as a christmas present but i may just keep it now."
5,One of the Best From Warner Bros.,I just don't know what took them so long to get this on the shelves. It was one of the best cartoons out in the 90's. My wife and I just loved it and now my kids do too. I just can't wait for the next round of the videos to hit the market. Pinky and the Brain was a great show then and it definately is now!!!
5,Brain Food,"As a fan of Pinky & the Brain (and nearly every thing else Animaniacs), I was pleased to add this CD set to my library. The quality of the animation and production is, of course, outstanding and the humor is either one of two things--adult enough to appeal to me, or childish enough to sink to my level. Excellent stuff!"
5,Pinky for President,"I love Pinky and the Brain.I must rest now, for tomorrow, ""We Plot to Take Over the World."""
3,"Great movie, score is good but...","I ordered this right after I watched the movie, which was a delightful surprise. There was one particular song towards the end of the movie that I loved...didn't know the artist or the name of the song, and I ordered the soundtrack to find out BUT it seems that song is not on here. At least I don't recognize it. Rather disappointing. I do like the music on here...but frustrated to still be in the dark about that song..."
4,ELIZABETHTOWN,Good soundtrack. Very good rendition of Moon River.Various tracks are interesting with less known artist and song except for Moon River.
4,A more music from CD which had to be made!....,"As the movie isn't that good,it music delivers so much and the both soundtracks are a must have for every music fans.Such talented artists and moving songs.What's funnier is that overall the CDs aren't my favorites but the creators managed to create such an atmosphere,world,sensation,ect...around it that I can't help but love theme for what they make me feel.It's true,this one's better but buy the first to cause one without the other's not the way it's supposed to be."
3,CD is okay,"I thought this was a better CD, but then again I only heard the CD twice. The fact the CD didn't really catch my attention. I liked two tunes: Don Campbell and the song Golden Touch. There was another song that caught my hear, but I can't remember right now."
5,Just yummy,"I love all the dried fruits and veggies from Just Tomatoes. The carrots are not snack-worthy for me (tasty, tiny bits), but my guinea pigs love them. I also like to munch on the corn and peas. You will want to transfer them to air tight containers after opening as they will get stale if you don't (you could even throw in dessicant packs)."
2,Tedious,"Parts of this book were very interesting, but over all it was way too broad. The author tried to cover too much; there were too many story lines. Alternating story lines every few pages became confusing. Using italics for every remotely Spanish word was ridiculous. The book needed a good editor."
5,Ireland in Song Frank Patterson,"Frank Patterson had a pure and beautiful voice and it was a pleasure to listen to so many of these old favorites. I think that his rendition of DANNY BOY would have pleased the composer. It contained all of the yearning and love of a parent speaking to his child in the full knowledge that it might be for the last time. Mr Patterson clearly understood that these ballads are classics because they represent a peoples heartfelt stories.The DVD also contains some fun and rousing Irish dance tunes and is ,all in all, quite satisfying."
4,Fun read...odd recipes,"The book itself is very good - covers the basics such as cooking methods (saute, braise, fry...etc) in Alton's usual style your used to on his show Good Eats. However the recipe's are odd and quirky and not really very practical. Buy this book because its a fun read on food science but not for the recipes."
5,A must have in the kitchen,"Alton Brown has spent the last several years correcting everything that is wrong with cooking shows...mainly, they seem made for people who already know everything about cooking and food.In this book he brings all his knowledge to your fingertips for fast and easy reference. I use this book almost everytime I cook, not for the recipes but for the information behind a recipe. His show, and now his book, have helped my cooking tremendously.As in his show, this book covers every aspect of cooking (in this case meat). His explanations are thorough and scientifically sound. In fact, his book will most likely someday make it into our homeschool science curriculum. hehe"
5,Good Read,"Alton Brown's prose is as good as his cooking. This is the only cookbook I've read cover to cover. And it's the first cookbook that's made me laugh. The recipes aren't bad either. My wife says that the Grilled Butterflied Chicken is the best chicken I've cooked. The Chicken in Garlic and Shallots isn't quite as good but is wonderfully simple and aromatic; it's great for weeknight cooking.Alton Brown introduces each chapter with an explanation of the science behind the cooking. His approach is just right: enough information to understand why to use a certain approach but not enough detail to remind us of our high school chemistry texts. I'm the kind of cook who tends to follow recipes religiously and cross my fingers about the results. So, for me, Alton Brown's witty expalanations of the voodoo behind cooking are the best parts of the book."
3,Good but not great,"needs more charts or pictures, better than going on and on on very simple thingsneeds to use the empty areas on the pages"
4,Entertaining cookbook,"This is not a traditional cookbook, rather a fun explanation of the how and why of cooking. There are some recipes, but the book is more about understanding the whole process. The layout is nice- lots of color illustrations. It is like taking a cooking class but more fun and a lot cheaper. Topics covered include: searing, grilling, frying and braising. A thoroughly entertaining read for anyone who loves to cook."
5,Fun and Easy to Read,"Depending on your cooking level, this is a...>> (Beginner) necessary reference - just the thing to get you into the kitchen and cooking edible food (for once)>> (Mid-range) good summary of food types and what to do to make something that'll get into your cooking rotation>> (Expert) fun read with good cartoonish pictures and user-friendly presentation of cooking tips and techniquesFor all readers, it is a book worthy of adding to your library -- and the beef stroganoff recipe is great!"
5,Soup-Herb!!!,"This is a real textbook about how to cook, far from simply a recipe book. Fortunately it doesn't take itself too seriously, so technical points are tolerably presented. What one learns from it is applicable to a host of dishes. Very informative and useful!!!"
5,The Un-Cook Book,"Almost every other cookbook I've seen has a bunch of pretty pictures and recipes, but nothing on how to cook the food well or why that is the way you cook. It's about the only cookbook that tells you NOT to follow the recipes verbatim. And, as a plus, you sound really smart at dinner parties telling people the difference between kosher (yum) and table (yuck) salt, or the origin of charcoal, the sandwich, or why meats should be brined. Everyone who cooks should read this book."
5,"Emeril may be the reason that ""Food Network"" caught on, but","Alton Brown is one of the reasons it continues to gain subscribers! AB doesn't tout shiny copper cookware or German knives. He doesn't own a Viking stove top. His oven needs cleaning. His refrigerator has ""stuff"" in it that everyday people recognize.His forte is explaining what works in cooking and then why. He shows you what to look for in equipment and how to use items more likely found in a hardware store than a Crate & Barrel to cook. Because it WORKS.Funny, with lots to teach people about cooking.Entertaining book for everyday cooks."
5,Great book!,"When it comes to food, Alton Brown is a culinary genius. In this book, he explains the hows, whys, and whats of cookng techniques, along with some little side jokes. For every technique he also gives about 5 or 6 great recipes. This is a great book and reccomend it to any cook."
5,Excellent Book,"Alton Brown does and outstanding job of explaining and illustrating how things work in the kitchen or grill. His illustrations are humorous and easy to grasp. Learn how heat is really transferred to your food via different cooking methods and what that means to the outcome. The knowledge presented in this book will make you a better cook if you apply it. For example, the frying section provides great tips on how to keep your foods crispy and relatively low fat. It's simple science and it makes sense easily when presented in this book."
5,Good Eats and why !!!!,Reading this book is just like having Alton Brown appear in your own kitchen. He has a terrific way of explaining all things related to food and the preparation of food - resulting in some very easy to follow directions resulting in GOOD EATS !! I love his approach and the way he uses simple illustrations to get his points across. This is a book I will use over and over again.
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book...I am a big fan of Alton Browns TV show...I learn a lot from it. In this volume, Alton spends too much time on jokes, and not enough time on useful information. He has so much to teach, I think he is very knowledgable, at least that is how he comes across on TV...but I found myself skimming through the retoric, looking for cooking information."
5,"Automatic ""Betterness""","If you read this book, you will automatically become a better cook, period, end of review."
5,Buy this book!,"If you like ""Good Eats"", you'll love this book! This is by far the best cookbook I own... not just for the recipes (which have all turned out great), but for the techniques and science of cooking that can be applied to any recipe you create. I actually read this book cover-to-cover, which I have never done with a cookbook before, and refer back to it often. This book is loaded with comical and off the wall tidbits as well, which kept be chuckling to myself throughout the book. Whether you are a pro or novice in the kitchen, you can learn a thing or two from this one, and you'll be entertained along the way!"
4,Interesting and goofy,"Some are more realistic than others, but all are entertaining. I'll certainly allow this book when I start my own nation off the coast of Africa."
4,This stuff might work!,"So help me, a lot of this stuff might actually work... Of course most of their ideas would take more time, money and resources than i'll ever have, but they're fun to think about!"
5,Worth reading then and especially now,I read this book back in the early 70's and it impacted my life. It was relevant then and is especially relevant now.
4,accessible bucket...........head,"Good, strong BucketHead et al effort. Understandable, not too 'fringy' or strange, as some BucketHead solo efforts often are.It is Praxis , and that is almost always very good to great. Not as solid and commercial as Tennessee 2004, which is my favorite, but on the right path, the direction going forward ( with thought )."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I purchased this book after a training session at my school, however, it was not what I anticipated and was not useful to me. I understand the idea behind the story telling, however, for the age I teach (high school) it did not seem appropriate. Perhaps a younger audience would benefit from the stories."
2,"Fun ""What If--?"" Story.... WAY OVERPRICED","I just read this story arc, from ""Death of Odin"" to ""Gods And Men"".Its a fun ""What If--?"" kind of story, although the ending felt rushed.What trips me out is the insane pricing for these books! $50-$200?Just this saturday (6/5/10) I bought ""Death of Odin"" and ""Lord of Asgard"" at my local comic book shop for COVER PRICE... Plus, they gave me a 20% discount.I don't understand the huge markup, especially for these books, which aren't that sought after."
1,such a disappointment,"This series is a wanna-be copy cat/pale imitation of the WALTER SIMONSON STORIES. Dan Jurgens must have loved Simonson's writing so much that it stuck to his subconscious.This is a cheap way to get people to buy the comic: DEATH OF ODIN may sound interesting but the story was flawed and doesn't know which direction it wants to go. Dan Jurgens may be the worst THOR scribe ever. He made such a mess that Marvel had to cancel this book and hopefully they will try to get Simonson or Thomas back on board to try and re-vitalize this series.Forget this, JURGENS DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE THOR!"
5,Excellent Condition,Couldn't believe a book in this condition would sell at such a low price. Completely satisfied with this item and with the service provided by vendor. Will purchase from them again!
4,A pretty good Destroyer novel.,"I enjoyed this book. It isn't the best book in the series, but it's definitely a fun one. If you can find a copy, check it out."
2,Not sized right,"I had to return these. Unfortunately, the Maidenform, Vanity Fair, Lily of France, and other associated brands, are fitted for women who are filled out evenly, not low-busted. I have always found these labels to gap at the top of the cup in my correct size, but cut in and leave an unsightly line at the top of the cup if I try sizing down. I had hoped that a lower-cut style with padding would solve this, but it did not. To me (as someone who sews) it seemed like the cup sizing was not changed to accommodate the pad, and the top edge of the cup cut in quite a bit. The dent with a roll of excess breast over the top was definitely a fashion ""don't"". If you're built less full across your upper chest and are looking for something that will move everything up, this is probably not the first brand you should try."
4,Not perfect for me but overall a good buy,"I have had small breasts since... well my whole life, and am constantly looking for a bra that will enhance what little I have. This particular bra would have been excellent IF I had the assets to fill the entire cup. That said, it is comfortable and I like the fancy frill on the sides and up the straps. I was worried it may irritate my skin but it isn't coarse like some other bra's extra frill is (I have very sensitive skin). I would have given it 5 stars, but like I said it doesn't quite suit precisely what I needed. However, if you have a little more than I do I would suggest this bra."
5,want more!,"I love these so much its the only ones I wear even tho I only bought 4 pairs, I need to get more because Im always grabbing them out of the dryer and I would like to have enough to actually put away. I am a woman, it accidentally says my husbands name"
3,Not quite big enough,"If you wear a size 11 lady's shoe, Large may be on the small/short side. It's supposed to accommodate up to 11.5, but I'm sure that's not possible. I'll be able to use them, but I anticipate that they will ride down my heel, like other reviewers have noted. I have another pair of Thorlo socks, I love them, but these are different, not quite right in the fit. Definitely going to avoid putting these in the dryer."
3,VERY EXPENSIVE for ONE pair of socks & wouldn't fit in my shoes!,"While I love the plush cozy socks and I can see that they are high quality, I was floored when I opened the box and saw ONE pair of socks. Yup, one. Maybe I am cheapy, but it seems outrageous to charge over 10.00 for one pair of socks. They looked really nice though, so I put them on and they were heavenly to wear. So I excitedly tried to put on my running shoes... wait a minute, they don't fit now! LOL They call them ""Lite"" but my goodness, they took up so much room that I couldn't put on my shoes. They are NOT lite, I would most definitely call them PLUSH! I use them around the house now when my feet are cold; and they would be great in winter boots, but I can't recommend them for anything else!"
3,Highly overrated socks,These socks are no better than those cheaper socks... I bought into the hype from some over jealous buyers ....take note and hopefully you can benefit from my unimpressed experience ... These are cheaper socks out there that can just as comfy as these...too bad you open then you can return them
2,not as good at the competition,"i have long been a thorlo fan but have since changed my mind... i will now stick with the asics brand. while i love the cushion these provide, the ankle slips down into my shoe which gives me blisters from my sneakers. the asics have a little lip on theirs that prevents the slippage... i would recommend you try those instead!"
1,So disappointed,"I searched for socks that would be good for walking/running as my feet had been burning with irritation. Although there were many that said these were great socks, I have to say I am extremly frustrated with them! They ride down the backs of my heel and end up bunched up under my feet! I spent more money on them than I should have thinking they would do the trick but even walking around town today I have had to stop three or four times to take off my shoe, pull up the sock and re tie my shoe. Not enough elastic in the ankle or SOMETHING! Very disappointed."
5,EXCELLENT GIFT!!,"I love this book! I travel to Atlanta for work and was running along the side of the road out and back from hotels until I got this book. It has excellent directions for getting to the courses, has an overall map so you can pick a course based on location, and also gives alternatives for different distances and rates the course as far as hills/difficulty. It even has a trail section. I have done about 12 of the different courses and it keeps me motivated to get out and do my run and keeps it fun. I wish every city had a book like this!!"
3,"Good guide, but mileages and descriptions are wrong","This is a good guide if you don't know anything about Atlanta. I picked one run out of there to do my first 8-miler about a year ago. It was the long loop around stone mountain. The book listed it as ""flat,"" and it is anything BUT! There are hills around the whole thing! Also, the loop is supposed to be 8 miles, but it is actually about 7.2. All in all, it's a pretty good book, but some information can be deceiving."
2,No Good,"Ordered this item for a performance costume. The first copy came with a broken strand and the pearls rolling around in the shipping bag. We used the Amazon return process to return it and had a replacement within days. The second copy arrived in the exact same unusable condition. We can't try again, it wouldn't be available in time. Quality control on this product appears to be very bad."
4,Captivating,"If you only need one reason to purchase a collection of poetry, it's Muted Whispers. Zakiya's use of langage to encompass the reader into her world is unique. In Hate Born Out of Love, Zakiya forces the reader to re-evaluate traditional socially acceptable relationships and to find meaning for ones own life. I also loved her use of imagery in 25years. I am certain that many people can identify with it and share her joy and pain.Reading this book gives new meaning to poetry. I highly recommend it."
4,Touched or Untouched?,"How affected are we by the every day surroundings of life? How would we be or who would we become if we lived our lives totally unaffected? I believe ""Muted Whispers"" is a book of poetry written as a reflection of life, touched and untouched. I am looking forward to reading the future works of this author."
5,Inspirational and magnificent,"ZaKiYa's writing style reaffirms the essence of time, substance and quality of life. Her poetry speaks volumes of truth. One can not help but to be inspired. If you are not a fan of poetry you will be after reading Muted Whispers. If it does nothing else it will ease you into seeing things in a different light.ZaKiYa puts a spin on sexuality, erotica, and politics with her witty and honest words in ""Confessions"", ""Truth"" and ""Drug of Choice"" to name a few."
3,Time has caught up on Ballantyne,"I was increasingly frustrated the more I read of The Lighthouse. It is naive in its treatment of the real story of the building of The Bell Rock Lighthouse, and is extremely repetitive in its interruptions of the narrative in order to ""send a message."" But then, it IS a boy's story from another time. Stylistically, it is quaint. In the end, having stuck with it for about two thirds of its length, I gave up on it and turned instead to the Stevensons' story which is gripping and eye-opening."
5,Laugh Riot,"Ed Asner, Dabney Coleman, Ed Begley and Bryan Cranston in one movie? What could be bad? It's a total romp. A screwball comedy like the ones I love on TCM. There is a nutty intricate plot that compels without causing one to work too hard. The hi-jinx that ensues makes the ride well worth taking because it's so much fun. Every nutty type is on display and the setting in Las Vegas is perfect for the proceedings. Highly recommended!"
5,"Beautifully composed, masterfully played and recorded.","This is a memorable album. Close your eyes ease back in a comfortable chair and let your imagination draw you back to the days of noble kingdoms, princesses, minstrels and gallant knights, through the rich and soothing use of guitars, harps, flutes and violins. Masterful composition."
3,Needs better organization,"This book, like Tony Alley's ""3D Modeling with Cinema 4D R9"" is geared towards beginners. Unlike Tony Alley's book, some of the lessons are disorganized and do not clearly outline an approach to modeling, animation, lighting, or creating materials. The examples are fairly good in the beginning of the book, but towards the end, the author has individual paragraphs for each animation tool but never clearly describes how to use them. By attempting to cover so much material, the author leaves out details that gives one a somewhat muddy understanding of the program."
4,Great Tutorials,"This book has great tutorials on beginning to model and good descriptions of the functions of Cinema 4-D through those tutorials. It does leave some features/buttons out. However, the walkthrough practice modeling it gives you, knowledge of basic buttons and the knowledge of how to go about exploring the rest of the functions, as well as the fact the tutorials are easy to follow, easily makes up for it not being a modeling dictionary. If you're just starting modeling or just want a layout for the basic features of Cinema 4-D, I highly recommend this book."
2,Only partially satisfied,As a fan of two previous versions of the C4d Handbook I looked forward to working through the tutorials in the v9/9.1 book. The enclosed CD (necessary for the tutorials) refused to load and/or allow its files to be copied for use in Cinema 4D. I returned the CD to the publisher with explanation and received a new CD. Same problem. Returned it and got a third CD. Same problem. Very frustrating. The book looks well written as usual. Too bad it is usless to me.
4,Deceptively good book,"I say deceptive, because the name ""Sister Alice"" sounded rather hokey to me. In fact, this was one of those ""best looking book on the shelf"" pick ups for me, but I was glad I picked it up. A very far reaching book, the ideas are well developed and the narrative keeps you interested, even when the material has gone way above your head. I especially enjoyed the ""space chase"" scenes in the book, definately a FAR CRY from Buck Rogers, thats for sure."
3,Disappointing,"Being a fan of hard scifi, I found this book frustrating. There is plenty of room for science but it was glossed over and never examined. The main protagonists are virtual gods, yet don't have faster than light travel.It is an odd book. There are lots of teasing moments when events unknown are hinted at yet the eventual resolution of the story left me dissatisfied. Reed writes well and on a more modest scale the story could have worked very well. In fact it only needed to be 1000 years in the future at present rates of technological expansion.Peter Hamilton would have done better but the downside is he'd have taken three books to get there. :D"
2,Masters of Deception Deceives the unwary buyer,This book is little more than a brief summary of newspaper clippings. The author (Louis Mizell) achieves the same ends as the crooks about whom he writes. The unfortunate person who purchases this book believing that it may contain useful information about white collar crime or solid strategies to combat white collar crime becomes a victim of the author's own deception.
1,John Etheridge = teeth on edge,I can't listen to John's Chasing Shadows album anymore as it's too painful. The recording balance is very close and it picks up all those squeaky sounds when he slides his fingers up & down the fret board. It's just like someone scraping their fingernails on a blackboard.
1,Don't waste your time - nothing new here,"I don't know who the other reviewers of this book are, but...what are they thinking?? This book is fine if you are a teenager but for anyone with any experience with the dating world, it is basically a rehash of just plain common sense. Follow good personal hygiene? Dress in a sexy manner? Don't be negative? PLEASE! He mentions 10 sneaky things that men do to women on dates but doesn't deliver. Those are the things we need to know about.Don't waste your time with this book. It just doesn't deliver on its promise of helping women date successfully."
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"I was disappointed with this book. I wanted tips (after a long term relationship break-up) to get back into dating. I wasn't looking for a book on self esteem. Tips such as: stop living to please others, practice compassion, learn to laugh at yourself (I did that one a long time ago) are good self improvement tips, but if I wanted that kind of advice, I would read (again) Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People--a classic that hasn't been surpassed IMO. I wanted dating tips."
2,Unimpressive,"Not worth the purchase. Does not capture the modern dating scene. I shared some of the ""insights"" with several male friends and they disagreed with the type of woman Nakamoto thinks will succeed with men."
2,Mediocre at best...,"I was disappointed with this book. If I'd read someone else's copy, I would not have bothered purchasing it. Most of what I read was trite & a bit patronizing. I do not recommend it."
4,a good book,"I liked the book very much. as I am a very tough critic when it comes to books and i hate to be dragged along or in circles as many writers I find circle and reiterate their story so often that I loose intrest just a short way through. but I love true stories and reading about all the diferent types of dating sittuations out their. this book was my favorite in it's class, for this year, I liken it to ""Around The World In 80 Days"" and ""The Dream Begins When I Awake"" All grate dating compasses for people out and looking or just enjoy good whity stories."
4,Professor found this book very educating,"I teach at the college level and I'm a firm believer in being a lifetime learner. Why not approach dating in the same way as academics? I'm back in the dating world and have no idea how to navigate this new frontier. This book gave me lots of information, advice, confirmed some things I already knew and gave me the information I needed to empower myself in this new adventure. I feel more confident and ready to go.... Plus I liked the additional bonus handouts that were made available at the end of the book. Very very helpful."
5,FINALLY! A MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS!,"The book offers great insight to women trying to understand and succeed in the dating game. With a touch of humor and strong doses of common sense, the book's easy to read style leads the reader through practical ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" when trying to find a meaningful relationship. I loved the definitions and his ""honest male perspectives"" offered at the beginning of each chapter. A thoroughly enjoyable read."
5,"Mom Should Have Told You, but, If Not, Read This Book","Steve Nakamoto's latest book, Dating Rocks!, is as much a handbook for life as it is a handbook for love. Everyone could benefit from his guidance, which is lightly peppered with appropriate quotes from literary figures. As someone who spent way too much time trying to polish ""rough diamonds"", I particularly liked Smart Moves #1 and #2 (basically, recognizing the good guys and weeding out the others in a timely fashion). By the way, when you're working your way through the weeds, practice Smart Moves #11 - Becoming an Outstanding Listener. You'll be honing your skills for those good guys, and you might learn something interesting for Smart Moves #10. You know what that one has to be."
4,A Fun Read,"This book takes a different fun approach to dating. An easy read sprinkled with lots of helpful tips. I found the ""What to do Now"" part of special value."
5,use it all the time,I own a children's gym and use this and other Landy books all the time for creative ideas and extenders for our fitness classes. Both books are packed with great ideas! Highly reccomend to Elementary PE teachers or anyone who is looking for tons of ways to keep kids moving. Many introductions to sports skills plus lots more.
3,shipping,"though it was still delivered within the promised time, the shipping took a little longer than i was expecting"
3,"Good product, if it works.","The album has lots of great songs and the DVD has some interesting material. Its a real shame that the industry added the region codes to DVDs, because not everyone has access to region free players. I had to change the region of an old player of mine to play the DVD, but it was worth the added effort."
5,i do believe in miracles,i bought this disc at the same time i bought miracle with kurt russell and i love it. i was in the 7th grade and watched this story as it happened. my only wish is that because it is a short film i wish they could have put the whole real time game on and then this would have been a 10. still it tells the true story very well and the interviews with the players on both sides and the late herb brooks are priceless as a way to see just what this 60 min. of one game did for the players the country and the world.
5,Uplifting and inspirational,"What's not to like about this uplifting and inspirational portrayal of a real life sporting event! A feel good movie that doesn't grow old, even with repeated viewings..."
5,For anyone proud to be American.,"Definitely a great documentary. Definitely a great victory. This documentary is even better than the movie and I would recommend it over the movie. It is also obvious to me that there are some seriously bitter America-bashers writing reviews about something they will never have to be proud for. I make no apologies for loving America and Americans and everything that the world criticizes us for... for winning, for losing, for making right decisions, for making wrong decisions. This is our country and I am d*mn proud of it. I'm tired of being told by the select few how wrong it is to be American."
4,Do You Believe in Miracles DVD,"Product shipped right away, which was great as I ordered it amongst the Olympics hoopla and wanted to see it before the final gold medal hockey match. This is the HBO documentary that I have seen many times over the years and is the best (and most accurate) retelling of that miraculous feat in 1980, documentary or movie."
5,Great footage!,"wonderful to see actual footage of a game I missed that lifted the spirits of all of us. The only way this video could have been better would have been to include the entire game with the Soviets as well as the others. Might be nice, too, to have the films of the 1960 team, our first gold medal in hockey.Much better than the movie with Kurt Russell. Seeing, hearing Herb Brooks, Mike Eruzionne, et al was extraordinary. I continue to watch and never fail to get goose bumps."
5,"The Real Story of ""Miracle of Ice""","For those of you who saw the movie, Miracle, this is a great follow up with the real players and coaches. It covers every game the USA hockey played to win the gold medal. As Al Michals says in the film, ""Everyone forgets that the US team had to win one more game after beating the Russians."" With interviews with the players from both teams, you really get a sense of how much impact there was from a hockey game."
2,poor quality,front of right foot sole has already come apart and I've had the shoes for 3 weeks! the shipment time was great and fast but the quality of the dexter bowling shoe is terrible! very unsatisfied with the bowling shoes!
5,Sony Srsd21X 2.1 Mulitmedia Speaker System,"This is a great product, good price, nice sound, I would reccomend it for anybody."
2,Okay....,"....BUT I'm REALLY getting 'sick and tired' of these devices being 'hardwired' from one speaker to another.What I've noticed is that after a while the wires 'fail' and you have to buy a new system. That instead of buying new wires.It's a Dilbertism. See....[...]Instead of software, with these products it's the hardware.I'm going to begin looking for a standard amp-speaker system as I'm getting, as I said, ""Sick and tired"", of being taken to the cleaners RENTING a system for a year or two."
3,Okay Speakers. Expected More..,There is NO bass control which I found a little odd. I really think these need to be 20-30$ speakers. Had I tested this in a store I would have rather spent the extra money for the logitech ones. Since I am in a small room anyhow these speakers are sufficient and haven't had any issues yet.
4,"It's a Sony for ~$40, need I say more.","I'm not surprised that the used ones are going for a marginal difference from a new one, because it is a pretty decent pair of speakers.You can listen to a good range of soundsI'm not audiophilic, but here are my points of viewConsThe volume control is fixed to the speaker and the wheel is really small, so that can get a bit annoying as you have to feel your way though.Sub woofer may be a tad small, but not too much of a concern.No Bass control, which is very surprising.ProsIt's a Sony. Money well invested in a product that will last as compared to the others.Decent range of soundsVery Affordable speakers (~$40) for a 2.1 systemLooks good"
3,Pfffffffffft!,"I don't like the volume ""wheel"" - it's too flush with the side of the speaker, so adjusting the sound is difficult.The sound quality is good and I've purchased Sony products before and trust the name; it's the stupid volume adjustment wheel that ruins the product."
4,These are great but will not last.,"I love these speakers, i got them when i first got my pc about a year and a half ago. They work great with nearly everything i have that has a headphone jack. They have a great quality sound for a 2.1.I don't know about the rest of the people who own these but they are starting to cave in on itself. I mean the scroll button and on/off button plus the jack on the side of the speaker are falling into the speaker. I don't think they are worth fixing, i paid for mine at walmart for the same price on here (50).I just wanted to let people know (who might want to buy these) what might happen in a short period of time."
5,Ever Wonder How A Strange Sound Got On A Beatles Album?,"This book as the answer. It was written by their producer who sometimes had to work from insane directions. The Bealtes were not the only ones working hard on thier songs. George Martin contributed to the group as well. The parts on the early days are fascinating too. The chapter on the making of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is hysterical. By early days, I mean his early days as a producer of comedy records, and when he first started working with the Beatles. He has an interesting perspective on them, and their music. It never becomes more of a musical study then his story, which is a definite plus. This is worth reading."
3,This is not a book about The Beatles,"If you're looking for a book about The Beatles, this is not it. Your first clue is in the title. It's a book about George Martin. Although there are many references to The Beatles, the book is overwhelmingly about Martin's life."
2,a big letdown,"First, let me say that I absolutely love the Beatles and am a huge fan and admirer of George Martin - that's why I bought this book. However, it has been a huge disappointment for me. It manages to take a fascinating subject and make it boring. It didn't really reveal any new Beatles facts and is not very fun at all to read. This story has been told better in a million other places. Also, it's old - the copyright date for this version is 1995 but that's for the paperback version - it really came out in the late 70s. Sorry George, you're great, but this book was a big letdown.P.S. What's with the terrible grammar in the title? Who came up with that?"
2,Disappointing,"This is a blandly written book, that should have more of the Beatles in it. And Martin is so full of himself, John Lennon was right when he complained that those who worked WITH the Beatles thought they WERE the Beatles. And Martin basically makes that claim when he says, ""John and Paul were the big talents in the Beatles. George, Ringo and I were also-rans."" To include himself as being as important as George and Ringo in the Beatles' success shows nauseating conceit. LET IT BE is a great Beatles album, and Martin had NOTHING to do with its production. The Beatles might have been successful without George or Ringo, but I doubt they would have been enduring phenomenons. But I can still see them having been phenomenons without Martin."
3,not enough beatles,"good info about george martin and his history but not enough about the beatles, we all know thiers lots of books about the beatles but i was hoping to learn georges side of the story more."
5,entertaining and informative,"In defense of ""All You Need is Ears"":1) This is George Martin's autobiography. It doesn't purport to be a book ABOUT The Beatles, and it is unfair and foolish to fault it on this account.2) The Beatles broke up thirty years ago. Get over it. There are no ""new Beatles facts"" to be had. If you're bored with old recordings and old ""Beatles facts"" just move on. Pick some other rock group--or something.3) The subject-verb disagreement in the title is unfortunate, in my opinion, but hardly inexplicable. Someone thought it a selling point to preserve as much of the John Lennon song (""All You Need is Love"") it refers to as possible."
2,disappointed,I felt Mr. Martin could have gotten into the Beatles stuff sooner. Once he got there it wasn't that interesting....the Geoff Emmerick book was more entertaining & enlightening
2,"Nothing new to Beatles junkies, but educational on producing","If you are a Beatles junkie, you will want to read this just like any other book on the Fab Four to soak up more knowledge and learn first hand from someone that was an insider with not much to gain by not telling the truth. However, I found nothing that was very revealing that I have not read before about how songs were recorded or evolved in the studio. The exception, of course, is there is a lot of details about what a sound engineer and a producer really do for any studio recording. This information is more for those interested in techniques though, and not anything to do with the Beatles, except that there were some pioneering going on between George Martin's knowledge and the Beatles music. They both were learning from each other which is why there were such a great combination."
4,The Fifth Beatle,George Martin was the producer of the greatest pop group in history. His contributions to shaping the sound of the Beatles can not be minimalized. A breezy and interesting book by a person who was with them during their entire recording career. I would recommend this book to any Beatle fan.
3,Radiography of a loser,"John could have written ""Im a loser"" song thinking in his early producer. A very smart man full of ideas, but with any gift to take care of his own bussines. It's was a pity."
5,"A fabulous story, by one of today's musical geniuses!","I will perhaps write a more detailed review later, but just want to cast my 5-star-vote for this absolutely wonderful book. George Martin is an amazing musical genius. So glad to have the chance to read this great story!!!"
3,Only 25% about the Beatles,"Okay, I know this book is supposed to be about the career of George Martin. But you would think that he would devote a bit more about his dealings with the group that made him so famous. For the man who is called ""The 5th Beatle"" he seems to trivialize by omission with only about 1/4 of the book discussing the Beatles.On the positive side, George writes with intelligence and frankness. His experience in the music recording industry during its formative years (1950s-1970's) lends practical insight to the reader. I found it interesting so the book still has merit in spite of the reader wanting more personal insight on the Beatles.BOTTOM LINEIf you are looking for a book about George Martin and the recording industry then this book is for you. If you are looking for a book about the Beatles, then there are better choices - although you at least get a bit of Martin's viewpoint in here."
5,"Wow, what a CD Single.","A brand new, EXPLOSIVE Collection by Anna Vissi. All recordings are first rate, Anna sounds sexy & ageless + looks fabulous on the cover.This Album came out a few months before KRAVGI was released, note that all songs are available on the KRAVGI album (2CD).Recommended for all of Anna's fans across the globe..."
3,Strangely boring.,"I agree that this book was disappointing. It's hard to say why--I just didn't find it very readable or lively. I kept putting it aside and not picking it up again, so it took days to finish, even though it's quite brief. As a reader who's an ""inquirer,"" I was particularly put off by what felt like long, stern listings of what Anglicans believe; I felt like I was just being told that I'd have to learn to believe this by fiat rather than by having things explained.Don't let this cast aspersion on the rest of the series, though: I've now read Vol. 2 (Opening the Bible) and found it fascinating."
3,informative but boring,"This book goes into great depth about what Episcopalians believe and the origins of those beliefs. It is written for laypeople, but it is a slow read, rather dry and boring. There are very helpful discussion questions at the back of the book."
5,"CHICAS, BAILAMANOS!!!","This cd came out in the mid 90's when merengue was really popular on the east coast latin scene. Oro Solido captured the heat that made people dance and dance and dance. Their really fast merengues get you worked up; just in time to dance to one their slower ones like ""La Policia"". Buy this one and dance to it 3 times weekly, you'll lose weight the fun way!!!"
1,What was he thinking?,"There are no songs on this CD. There are a bunch of weird, cynical, nonsensical ramblings accompanied by some sound effects.I gather now the former Cars frontman is retired as he hasn't released anything in several years. That's unfortunate; I like most of his other CDs."
2,Oh . . . y'know . . . it's poetry.,"I dearly love Ric Ocasek's lyrical ability, and I even spent some time as an open-mic poet myself. But still, what can I say? It's a bunch of poems recited against various backgrounds of musique concrete. They're good poems. I liked the chick's stuff better than Vega's. (Surely they knew, going into this project with a pop mega-star, that they would be referred to as ""Vega"" and ""the chick""! No, I don't feel guilty for forgetting her name!)I especially enjoyed sitting and reading the poems from the booklet, in peace and quiet. The actual recording was a one-listen-only type deal. I don't even ATTEND poetry readings any more."
3,FRED WARING,"WE WANTED SOME OLD MEMORY EVOKING ARTISTS, ENJOY LISTENING TO FRED WARING. DON'T RECOGNIZE MANY OF THE ARRANGEMENTS IN THIS CD, BUT IT'S OK, GUESS WE'RE NOT THAT OLD!!"
2,False-Sappho,"I`m not a fan of Angelique Ionnatos and for me this CD was complete disillusion.Ionatos sings not original lyrics by Sappho, but only its translation in modern Greek (without translation in English in the booklet). I hoped that music was a kind of reconstruction of the Ancient Greek music, but no, it was modern mix of depressive academic avant-garde and Oriental-Greek folk style music. Maybe as a product of modern Greek culture it could be interesting to somebody (I prefer Vangelis), but if you are trying to understand the spirit of the Ancient Greece and antique poetry - this CD wouldn`t help you.Try CDs by Ensemble De Organographia with the instrumental music of Ancient Greeks and CD ""Melpomen"" by Conrad Steinmann and Schola Cantorum Basilensis - they sings the lyrics by Sappho in original, very impressive and beautiful."
1,NOT Black Chrome NOR Laser Etched,"This is not ""laser etched"" black chrome, whatsoever. Each of the bits has a baked enamel finish with painted sizes in gold; you know how long that will last with use, don't you? If the case were decent, once the lettering disappears off the bits, one could find the size with the ETCHED PLASTIC numbers, but the plastic is an injection molding form that is paper thin. This should last for about 6 weeks of use before it crumbles. Very disappointed, to say the least. Save your money and purchase something other than the ""New"" Stanley. Sending it back. Amazon: you need to check this one out yourselves."
4,"Good Quality, Decently Priced","I purchased these to bring my collection of sockets back up to snuff. They do the job well.I should give this item five stars but I feel the black color is actually a hindrance to the items function. I'll explain. When working outdoors with these, if you drop one it can be very difficult to spot on the ground or in a dark area such as under the intake of a car. I of course could have got these in chrome I suppose. But, was drawn to the black color because I liked the finish.They are very well made tools, and I have no complaints other than I should have got the chrome."
4,Awesome set,Great buy and cool looks. SWEEEET!!!! Case works good I stuck to the one side case as it works well. The 2 sided case has issues with pieces falling out.
4,Nice set,"Good inexpensive set for weekend machanics. Case is cheesy and dificult to get sockets out but I assume that's why so cheap. Also, needs wiping down before use to avoid black stains on hands. Would recomend though."
5,Nice set,"Good set and price. the box is not very good, but that was the only issue i had with the set."
4,Nice set for a good price,"Great product for the price. However, naturally Craftsman are better, but you can not pick up a craftsman set for this price. I would recommend this set to anybody."
4,Stanley 92-824 Black Chrome and Laser Etched 69-Piece Socket Set,"First one had a defective 3/8 drive ratchet, they sent a whole new kit very fast and works great....guess the black is good but the chrome would have worked just as well.....I bought this to keep sockets separate from other sets easier to control inventoryWould Recommend easily for anyone to use"
4,Ontdekt,"I knew one song of the MGB (apparations) from a tape I bought ten years ago in Canada. I lost the tape and lost the name of the band. By coincedence I rediscovered it, and bought this CD. Top, should have discovered it earlier. Thanks Matthew Good that you made this music!"
3,The 4th book in the funny science fiction series.,"This is the fourth book in the humorous science fiction series for children about a young space cadet and his unusual robot Norby. In this story, beings from another planet have invaded a planet of friendly dragons and deactivated all of that planet's robots. Jeff and Norby attempt to thwart the invaders who, they discover, believe that technology is bad. They all learn that only misuse of technology is bad. This book and ""Norby and the Lost Princess"" (the third book in the series) were also published together as ""Norby: Robot for Hire."""
5,A FAMILY MEMBER,"MADEA COULD BE IN SOMEONES FAMILY , I LIKE HER SPUNK SHE DEMANDS RESPECT, A VERY FUNNY PLAY , WITH SOME GUIDELINES ON LIFE, WHICH WAS INSPIRING TO ME., I AM A ROMAN CATHOLIC AND I LOVED THE GOSPEL SONGS.THIS PLAY HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERY ONE. TYLER PERRY IS GREAT, I WISH HE WAS MY SON. --RUTH L. WILSON --DESERT HOT SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA"
1,Meda goes to Jail,This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. totally Stupid.Tyler Perry is a good actor too but this did him no justice.
4,Tyler Perry,"You have to like the man to like his work, I see a message and good humor it is, see it for yourself and enjoy."
4,tyler perry plays and films,"i am a very big fan of tyler perry plays and films...i have his daddy's little girls and why did i get married and madea goes to jail the play and the movie meet the browns....tyler perry is a great writer and producer and there is a message in each of his movies and plays as well great entertainment in each....my kids can watch these with me,and that is hard to find now days...."
5,LOVE ITTTT,Tyler you deserve an award for this one. I only wish I had seen the play when it came to my city. I really enjoyed this DVD and would recommend this to others.
1,Mislabeled,No where on this product was it made clear that it was a taping of live theatre. I expected the studio movie not the play.
5,Hilarious...,I had to share the experience with friends.Loved the part when they all starting singing.That was a trip!!
5,"REAL LIFE , NOT BS","MADEA STEPS UP TO HELP THOSE SHE CARES ABOUT, NO MATTER WHAT THE COST. IF MORE PEOPLE SET RULES FOR THEIR KIDS LIKE SHE DOES, THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE RUNNING THE STREETS, DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL AND TOTALLY DISRESPECTING THEIR PARENTS, . I AM A 55 YEAR OLD WHITE LADY FROM RICHMOND CA, WHICH HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST MURDER RATES IN THE COUNTRY AND I HAVE SEEN IT ALL. IF SOME OF THE PARENTS HERE DID WHAT MADEA DID, THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT BE IN SCHOOL INSTEAD OF A CEMETERY. I AM BUYING THIS DVD FOR MY FRIENDS. THIS DVD IS FUNNY, SAD, AND SURPRISING -- YOU WILL ENJOY IT."
5,Pay Attention!,"The movie version is a stage version of Madea Goes To Jail. Regardless, it was down to earth and hilarious. Yes! Bring back old school-it works!"
1,This modern day Flip Wilson needs to be locked up!,"I never understood the hype around this gomer pile. He is loud and obnoxious, he smokes and drinks and walks around with a fake pistol(all this while poorly imitating black women). Mind you that these are churchgoers hyping this fruit(that looks like a f****t in and out of his drag wear) up. Tyler Fairy or Tyler Scary is a disgrace and should slapped senseless like his assinine fanbase. Just because he gives you a cheesy rags to riches story of his life and throws some Gospel songs in his secondhand plays dont make him the best thing since bread and butter. STOP SUPPORTING THESE MINSTREL CLOWNS! PS how can you people talk about the moral depravity of Jerry Springer and Maury Povich while laughing and applauding the moral depravity of this balless hoemo? Hypocracy is an ugly thing."
1,Tyler Perry Insults Us Yet Again,"With ""Madea Goes to Jail,"" Tyler Perry takes his rightful place along side Eddie Griffin and Bill Cosby as the top people who take the African-American race back ten years every time they open their mouths."
2,Stage Play?,"It's a stage play! If I wanted to see a stage play, I'd go to a theatre. I thought the idea to make this a stage play took away from the realism of the movie/play. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't buy this DVD. I like Tyler Perry, but he could've re-thought this one. Needless to say, I was dissapointed, and hit the off button before it was over."
5,Madea Goes to Jail,I think that Tyler Perry continues to send his messages about life in a positive manner.
5,Madea is great!@,"Tyler Perry does come out of character towards the end but, it was great. I have the DVD, and you wouldn't believe how funny it was. Like this a every other play it has a message."
5,madea goes to jail {tyler perry collection},"WONDERFUL PLAY!!! very funny! great storyline, very well delivered. a must have for my collection."
3,Belongs in jail ...,"This play wasn't as good as Meet the Browns.Too many songs & gospel, not enough comedyThe characters didn't click, so I ended up doing dishes.It's interesting to watch the plays as things are ad-libbed.They're not as contrived as the movies."
4,Brazil at a glance,Few oportunities to listening something about Brazil. This CD has some songs about Brazilian folk. Pelo is a historical place in Brazil and has a very good music. Don't miss that !
5,Great Bear for a Great Price!,"I got this bear for my niece. It came packaged nicely and suitable for storing (my niece is only a couple of months old) for a couple of years. I enjoy shopping for cheap, yet nice toys that I can give in the future. I'm sure she will really appreciate this in a few years."
2,Don't judge Barbirolli's Sibelius by this wretched collection,"Although the Gramophone raves over Barbirolli if he coughs on disc, he can be quite variable. Even more so is the Halle Orch. a wild card. It is capable of sounding quite at home in Sibelius -- witness the great Sibelius fourth that Barbirolli recorded in 1969 -- but you'd never know it form this out-of-sorts program of Sibelius's most popular occasional pieces. The brass chords that open Finlandia are so grating that it's hard to continue, and things don't get better later on in this rough-as-sandpaper reading. Every item dates form a two-day session in Jan. 1966, and the ship never rights itself. It's too bad that the complete Sibelius edition that EMI put out to honor Barbirolli begins with this same CD; it must be one of the few outright duds in the later career of an underestimated conductor who rose to eminence, quite deservedly, in the five or six years before he died."
2,No Subtitles,"Despite all claims on the DVD, booklet, and box, I have found no way to get the subtitle option on the onscreen menu to work and no way for the English subtitles (or Spanish ones) to be shown. This on 2 players. I do not know what the problem is."
3,A book that leaves you wanting to know more,"I made the trip to Bodie and bought the book at the museum. There are many interesting stories that are touched upon, but with few details. If you are interested in an overview this is an excellent source. The Author has written several other books on various aspects of life in Bodie and I intend to buy them to broaden my knowledge.I wish the pictures were of better quality. They are ok considering the paper quality but the half toning and resolution could be improved."
5,It's Really Growing On Me,"Season 2 picks up right where season 1 left off. The first time I watched Baka and Test, I was a little let down. I watched a couple more times, and I really liked it. It's a lot of fun. Season 2 is pretty much just about the guys of class F trying to peep on the girls' changing room and bath. It's kind of odd that an entire season of this show is dedicated to that single purpose, but it's still really fun. There are a couple background episodes for the main characters. Season 2 is a little better than the first one. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all still really good. I think that they are gonna continue this series even further. I hope they do. It's a lot of fun to watch. I think that it's a safe bet for most anime fans. The language is moderate, and there isn't any nudity. So 14 and up is a good rating. I highly recommend it."
4,I relly enjoyed it.,"This anime was worth the money. It is a nice anime to watch if you like the pervert humor side of things. the quality is very good nicely colored and the audio is great too , it sorta has its points where it's not as up beat like the First season but this second season makes up for it in depth of some characters which i loved the fact it recaps in to the romance area. It reminds me of Heavens Lost Property in some parts but like i said the pervert humor side of things makes it a blast. Very glad I got it and can not wait for the next one."
5,Deeper understandig and registries,"Several books in the market gloss over the UDDI technology. It is usually an addendum to a book about Web services or service oriented architecture. It was a pleasant surprise to see that there is a book dedicated to this topic. I firmly believe that until registries such as UDDI become commonplace, the true vision of SOA cannot be achieved. The authors make several good points regarding this. I also liked the examples used in the book -- more real-world than registering hello world services.It's bit longer read, but totally worth it when you are writing and registering more complex Web services than Echo and 20-min delayed stock quote."
5,Nicely Done,"Rebecca Blood's account of blogging, her story from the early days to the present, woven into a neatly structured account of what blogging is and how to go about it, is a pleasant read. The book is not technically deep nor philosophically profound, but well written and pitched at an appropriate level for the average starting web-logger.One of the ways to measure the value of a book is to ask if the reading of it has changed the way one does things. The question is not so much ""What did I learn?"" but ""What impact did this have on what I do?""The answer, of course, is person bound; a book that has changed the way I behave may have no impact on someone else's actions. Rebecca Blood had a direct influence on my projects. For example, WikiDiction now has a space for linking to relevant quality blogs; added after finishing the chapter ""Finding an Audience"".Nice work Rebecca."
4,Good introduction and history of weblogs,"Rebecca Blood has been around blogs since their beginnings, and she aptly applies that knowledge to a thorough account of their origins and transformation.While the historical account is interesting, Blood also effectively describes the etiquette of blogging as well as some of the finer technical points of setting one up for the first time.If you're new to both the Internet and blogging, this is a must read. If you're fairly comfortable with the Internet, some sections on marketing and the technical aspects of blogging might seem like old news, but you're still likely to pick up some good tips."
5,An intriguing and informative survey,"For an easy introduction, choose Rebecca Blood's Weblog Handbook: it explores how such logs work, their impact on media, and how to participate in a weblog. An intriguing and informative survey of different kinds and styles of weblogs and how they foster new communities."
5,Composing in Cyberspace,"Rebecca Blood's ""The Weblog Handbook: Practical Advice on Creating and Maintaining Your Blog"" is a necessity for anyone wishing to enter into the burgeoning world of cyber-composition. Her expert advice is aimed at the raw beginner and will take one through each step of creating one's own weblog. Besides information on creating and maintaining a weblog, she offers counsel on finding the writer's ""voice,"" and finding an online audience. She also puts emphasis on the web ""community"" and its unique set of social guidelines, not the least of which is a repeated emphasis on ethics. While the 'net exhibits myriad examples of boorish, self-interested drivel, Blood wants her readers to be responsible bloggers who have meaningful things to say. I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to get into the blogging world as well as for teachers of composition."
4,Teaching a writing teacher to blog,"The Weblog Handbook is now an addition to my Rhetoric and Composition Studies bookshelf. While Blood does not explicitly make recommendations for teachers, this text is insightful on how and why such writing online deserves attention. Her easy-to-read chapters have prompted me to ask my students to move beyond email and instant messaging and into a blog with the hope that they become more mindful of word choice, style, content and audience."
4,The Weblog Handbook,"Rebecca Blood's handbook on blogging is an excellent guide for beginners. This book provides information on everything from creating a blog for the first time to maintaining an existing blog. Blood includes sections on weblog etiquette and ethics, which is especially helpful for those who are just starting to blog. Throughout the book she also includes relevant links. Her tone is informal, which makes the book an interesting and easy read."
1,Only for the Bored,"I had high hopes for this book. I've had a blog for a year now, and I was hoping for tips and inside info on the blog world. Instead I read a book that adds nothing to what's available on the web and is a help to no one who has been on the web for a week or two.Save your money and explore the blog world on your own. It's much more interesting, and better yet, free."
4,Makes me want to start my own weblog today!,"I like Rebecca's Pocket and have been considering starting my own blog so I purchased this book. The best thing about this book is that Rebecca is obviously very enthusiastic aboout blogging, especially about what it can do for the confidence and writing abilities of the blogger. The book gives some practical questions potential bloggers need to ask themselves before starting a blog. The only reason this book isn't rated higher is that it is a little outdated - but it still has good information.Did I end up starting a blog after reading a book? Not yet. I still haven't been able to answer for myself the question posed by Rebecca, ""If you spend 8 hours + a day in front of the computer for work, are you willing to spend an additional few hours in front of a computer at home writing your blog?"""
3,"Great Marketing, Wordy, Alll-and--all, A Good Read","Loved the historical review, the tone of the insider whispering to the novice. Would have liked to have seen some screen captures and quotes from exemplarly blogs.I appreciate Blood's description of her process, particularly her dedication, her focus on clear writing. I disagree w/ the notion that blogger's shoudn't use rewrite tools, though I understand the spirit of her defense of the archive....I guess I can't get over the desire to rewrite.My major complaint w/ this book is that it's wordy. After a while, say 25 pages, it repeats itself."
2,The Weblog Handbook.......,"Did better on my own BLOG by jumping in and working on it, instead of using this book."
3,For utter newbies only,"Having had a blog for a couple years, I thought this book might offer some insight into blogs and the rationale behind them. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish reading this book so filled it was with cheerleading and the sort of handholding that would tick off my independent diva of a 3-year-old. Still, if you've never had a blog, don't know what one is, and are remotely interested in them, then this book can probably give you some good information. Otherwise, spend your money on something else more fun."
2,A bit dull,Cary Stayner's poor excuse for turning into a murderer is that he was in the shadow of his younger brother (who was kidnapped as a boy)??? If standing in the shadow of a sibling is reason to become a murderer then half the country would be out there killing people. The writer gives a very tabloid type of read. There is nothing substantial to the book. John Walsh gave a chapter in one of his books to this story and I remember him describing the room that the three women stayed in. It was described so chillingly that I got goosebumps.
1,poor and poorer,"Unfortunately, I probably read more information and had more insight on this crime having read the local paper. Not only was the editing poor but the whole story lacked any substance. Too bad! I love true crime but after this I won't buy any books by this author. Sorry! Don't waste your money."
2,Not Much Ado About Cary Stayner,"The book is rather confusing with the details sparse. It starts off recounting the ordeal of Steven Stayner, then slowly gets into the ordeal of the murdered tourists and the step by step process the police and FBI undertook to find the killer. The author seems to go off on a tangent with minor suspects' backgrounds to a distracting degree. By the time you are nine-tenths finished with the book, Cary Stayner shows up as a major character and is given short shrift after he confesses at the conclusion of the book.All in all the book seems hurried and without much human interest.On the back of the book it's mentioned that Cary Stayner was arrested at a California nudist ""colony."" The use of the term, ""colony,"" instead of ""camp,"" ""resort,"" or ""park,"" reflects the sad state of the fact checking in the book. Speaking as a nudist myself, I can assure you that ""colony"" hasn't been accurate in nudist circles since the 1960s."
5,Very Satisfied,I was very impressed with the speed of delivery for this item. The item was in very good condition as well. Thank you.
5,Dead in Dixie-Southern Vampire books,"Ya gotta love Sookie Stackhouse and her ""posse"" of normal, dead and non-human friends. Charlaine Harris has a wonderful imagination and I thoroughly enjoy every one of her books, plus I've ordered the True Blood HBO series which gives faces to all the characters. Go Charlaine!!!"
2,Shapeshifters in Simsboro,Ms. Harris isn't Anne Rice (thankfully to my tastes) and unfortunately isn't too terribly familiar with the culture of North Louisiana. I heard she was writing about vampires in a part of the world where I spent 20 years so I was intrigued. She like many others tries to inject South Louisiana into an area that just isn't like that at all. It caused problems in my ability to suspend disbelief so I was unable to really get into her stories.
1,just plain bad,"There really is no point to this movie. I mean there is absolutly nothing original to this movie, no surprise there, and i guess a movie doesn't have to be super original to be a good popcorn flick, most movies are rehashes off other movies now adays. But atleast it should have some inovation added to it. This movie is like artificial powdered milk, a rehash of a rehash...oh I guess I could go on for days, but I'll just finish with why watch this when there are a million rehashed horror movies done a million times better."
2,Not too bad,"I rented this DVD and actually really enjoyed the first 30 minutes. The title is misleading as the graveyard is only a backdrop for a sleep-away camp type slasher flick. The characters for the most part are good and the suspense level is more than expected for the first 45 minutes, but then it drops off quick. The killer is known almost immidiately and a few characters never really fit into the plot. Overall, this is no classic, but fits the general mold of 80's slasher flick done 20 years past it time..."
2,THIS IS BLOODY MURDER 3 PEOPLE,"Well my title says everthing this movie was suposed to be bloody murder 3 but because this series of terrible horror movies was so trashed and got such a bad reputation the makers decided that they will .......... * stop production ? * .......... NO ........ they will keep the movie as it is but CHANGE the TITLE ........ OK ....... that solves everthing , this movie is like the other bloody muder films ....... low budget , bad actors , full of cliches , bad script ,and so on ....... DO NOT rent this movie , DO NOT buy this movie if you see this title anywere RUN AWAY fast ."
3,Cliche slasher film,"Seven friends play a cruel joke on a friend in a graveyard and he dies. Years later one of his family members starts killing them off. Cliche, but not bad for low budget."
1,This should of stayed in the Graveyard,A group of friends go to a graveyard for a game of hide and seek but something happens that night when their friend Eric is accidently killed. Their friend Bobby takes the wrap and is sent in lock up for 5 years. Now 5 years later Bobby is sprung out and the gang all go to remember their friend Eric. They all camp up at this camping resort with cabins and what not. Suddenly someone is starting to kill everyone off one by one. No logic in this brain dead thriller killer movie. The whole movie is one big pile of crizap with lame acting and terrible dialouge. Nudity yes but it's nothing special. Divert this BOMB while you still can. Forgettable stupidity fails bigtime
2,"Usual vampire fodder, but with a Southern twist","To start with, the blurb on the book is very inaccurate. What bride?!? What rat?!? And the preacher turning 3 members of his congregation into vampires is not a slaughter. The only real saving grace for this book is the humorous Southern slant on vampires and the interesting history behind the old Mountain Man as he recalls his terror in 'Nam. The ending is predictable and disappointing. If you're looking for a good vampire book, look elsewhere."
3,"OK, though not as good as FEAR","When I first read this book, I was filled with anticipation after reading FEAR by Kelly. Well, lets just say I was disappointed. The book starts off pretty good but then slacks off. It, as one reviewer stated, turns out to be predictable. If you want a good vampire story I suggest reading THE SUMMONING by Bentley Little. In no way is this to suggest that Kelly is a bad writer, because FEAR was excellent. I think he just didn't put much thought in to this one."
4,"Yours Till Niagara Falls, Abby","I think this book was very comical. It shows how horrible camp can be when bad things keep on happening to you like getting poison ivy. I really did enjoy this book because I go to camp every year and to me it's kind of boring, but this book taught me how I can just learn to get the best out of it. The best part of the book to my opinion was when at the end Roberta and Abby sign some kind of pledge to their friendship. This shows how much they enjoyed their company and how much friends should care for each other. I think O'Connor really deserves the highest award for her magnificent job on this book. I also like the way she put all of her childhood experiences in the events because it really made it enjoyable for some kids who like adventure."
3,"Decent book, no surprises","This is a fairly engaging story for youngsters, but nothing about it makes it stand out. The characters are somewhat one-dimensional; the writing is clean but undistinguished, and the plot is exactly what you would expect: girl gets roped into summer camp, arrives with trepidation, faces obstacles, and manages to fit in.I would recommend this book to anyone who has or is planning to have some summer camp experience, because it does give you some idea of what to expect.The letters that Abby writes from camp to her best friend Merle and her parents are also pretty funny."
3,copping out,"deceptively alluring title piggybacking turow classic. pedestrian prose,pacing and sentiment. the central question is who snuffed a child molester while in police custody. interesting interspersing of talk radio excerpts about the case. not particularly legal or thrilling, a prosaic whodunit."
3,Title character needs work,"The first Lelia Kelly book I read was Officer Of The Court. If I had started with Presumption of Guilt I may not have continued with the Laura Chastain series. The character Laura Chastain, in my opinion, just isn't a likable person. I liked her even less in False Witness. She improves a lot in Officer of the Court.In Presumption of Guilt and False Witness I got tired of Chastain deciding her scenario is always the correct one and trying to force everyone to prove she's right. Come on, Tom would still be alive if it wasn't for Laura. It's as though Lelia Kelly can't decide if she wants Laura to be a wimp or a great heroine.If you're bored and need something to read, the Laura Chastain series is OK. If you've just gotten back from the book store with several good books, put Lelia Kelly's book on the bottom of the stack."
4,Battle of the sexes,"This is one of those Romantic Comedies which pits the two genders against each other. It delves into the ways in which women & men think and how they can interpret the exact same circumstances in very different ways. All along, they go about psycho-analyzing each other.In this film, the ""crisis situation"" is that two married men are caught by their wives going to a strip club to ""let off some steam."" While such an incident is pretty banal in my life, it causes the two wives to go through an emotional Armageddon.The remainder of the movie (basically a real-time film) sees the two husbands & two wives try and justify their position / actions to their spouses. A fairly trivial matter escalates into a sort of marital nuclear war.If you like Romantic comedies, this film is certain to be appealing. While it's a bit dry in some spots, it does include some funny moments. Paul Reiser is always fun to watch, and it's good to see him champion the male-point-of-view in this farce."
2,Zodiac of Death,"I was VERY disappointed in this book. I found it in the Astrology section, and had hoped to find information that will help in recognizing the charts of people who have the potential for violence. Instead, I found a book that was shallow in the extreme. There was very little on any of these cases to explain the pattern of energies. The greatest value in the book was the birth data. Using this, the astrologer can construct the chart and do his own deliniation."
5,A carefully-researched and entertaining work,"I came to this book as a true crime fan with an amateur interest in astrology, and I thought it was fascinating. It contains profiles of the lives and charts of 51 killers, some widely-discussed, like Jeffrey Dahmer and the Menendez brothers, and others lesser-known. The astrology has been edited for the general reader, but appears to have been meticulously researched. For example, the authors profile only those individuals for whom they have obtained the exact time of birth, and the actual charts are included, both of which set this book apart from much popular astrology I've seen. The astrological conclusions are consistent with the school of astrology with which I am familiar. It's a real page-turner, and exceptionally well-written."
2,Extremely Simplistic,"I find it very painful reading. First off, the interpretations of the charts are very run of the mill. The authors do not take time to explain the aspects fully and they tend to gloss over them in a hurried way. Also according to them, the fourth house rules the father and the tenth rules the mother. That is backward. Most readers who know even a little about astrology know that the opposite is true. This book was obviously made for money- and unfortunately, the authors got mine. A much better read is ""Destined for Murder"" Profiles of Six Serial Killers, by Sandra Harrisson Young w/ astrological commentary by Edna Rowland. This book is much shorter, yet it is better researched, more concise and the data is more accurate. They go beyond the usual ""aspects"" and have opened my eyes to midpoints and other factors that I might never have considered before."
1,Zodiac of Death not an Astrology Book,I was horribly disappointed in what I had hoped would give some insight into the behavior patterns of violent personalities. This book belongs in True Crime or some other area -- NOT in Astrology!
4,"Very good beginner's grammar text, but...","This is the first Russian grammar book I picked up and it's quite good, but Schaum's is better. Don't get me wrong, I've used and can recommend both, but if you only want one, get Schaum's Outlines of Russian Grammar by James S. Levine instead of this one."
1,Waste,This product never arrived. I ordered this book along with New Penguin Russian Course months ago. New penguin arrived in days but I still don't have this book.
3,Book OK - CD not so helpful,I took Russian 1 last spring. I found this book to be somewhat helpful but I don't think the CD is much help for someone starting fresh. I was disappointed.
5,Like them,These labels are very useful for price tickets. My wife and I use them for out business. Dymo makes quality products!
4,Great comb but a little pricey,I could swear a few years ago (even 1-2 years back) the prices for brushes and such were much cheaper all around. After taking my dog to a new groomer she came back fluffier than I've ever seen her. My dog is a shih-tzu poodle mix and her hair does get matted when it gets longer. Her poodle side makes her hair curly when it grows out. My previous groomers always told me to use a slicker brush to brush her hair but the slicker does not get down to her skin. With the comb I feel like it is easier on her skin and it makes her fluffier all around.Anyway 4 stars only because I feel like the price is a little high. The comb itself is sturdy and having the two sides is another benefit. The wider side will help with breaking some knots and the thinner side helps brush out her hair.
4,Good product but you can't choose the color you want.,I like this comb. I bought 2 different brushes for my puppy that did not work well for her. This comb glides through her fur with ease and she actually enjoys being groomed now. I do wish you could pick the color but that is not a huge deal. Worth the money.
3,The comb is great but I really wish I had a choice in color,I purchased this comb because it is the one my breeder uses. The combs are great I just wish this seller would allow the buyer to choose the color. My dog is a male and of course I received a pink comb :(
2,"Flimsy, and at this price, you might as well get a professional one.","I groom professionally, and I ordered this comb as a cheap temporary replacement for a professional (metal) comb, until the professional one I really wanted was back in stock. To put it simply, I used this comb a total of three times before I got fed up and asked to borrow one of my coworkers combs until I could get a better replacement. This comb is flimsy, and it doesn't penetrate nearly as well as a real grooming comb. At all. If anything, I think it's more painful for the dog too, because it has too much bend and give, making it snag and pull too easy instead of going straight through the hair. For LESS money, you can buy a metal/durable comb that will not only last longer, but will be easier to use, and less of a strain on your poor dog. I recommend a stainless steel comb from safari, if you're looking for an inexpensive, yet fantastic comb (I believe it's 6.99, which makes it cheaper than these plastic/crappy bamboo ones)."
4,Refeshing,"The other night, Kaddisfly was supposed to play a show at a small club in Provo, UT. My friends I showed up a few minutes before the show was to start. The place was completely dark and empty. As we were standing around, a van with a trailer on it pulled up to us. Much to our surprise it was the band. Turns out the club owner just totally dogged them. My friends I hung out with the guys while they looked for a place to play. Five of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. I offered my garage as a possible venue...and they would have done it, but they found a comedy club nearby where they could play. They were by far the best band there, but they only played a twenty-minute set to a handful of people to kick off the show. Flawless performance. My point is that it's refreshing to hear such a unique and talented band in a time of cookie-cutter ""punk"" bands. They actually care about the music they play, and put something into it."
4,A solid release!,I was pretty hyped about this release from one of the more unique sounding bands on the Hopeless records camp. I see all these reviews commenting on the familiar style of this band. I think I can pinpoint it to sounding like a fresh punk mixture of Incubus and that old band (if anyone remembers these guys) Simon Says. Incredible sounding stuff. This album has that aura about it that it's freshness and excitement won't wear off anytime soon.
4,Heh...,"Easily one of the best albums to come out in a while. You get really caught up in it easily. But I'm not gonna throw out the 5-er, just because I don't think its flawless. It starts out a little sketchy, but they really bring it home. These guys play an excellent live show too.p.s. - This album is definitely not a sack of poo."
5,Finally Hugs and Tugs are here!,"I was a huge Care Bear fan when I was younger. I have several of the new plush Care Bears by PA Distribution and I think they're great for a long time fan or someone who just wants a cozy teddy bear. Tugs, and his sister Hugs, are the babies of the Care Bear clan. This toy is smaller than the full-sized 13"" (I'd say he's about 10 or 11"") but just as soft and cuddly. A+Please note: Tugs does *NOT* come with a video, like the ""adult"" bears do. He comes with a *BOOK* entitled ""Caring for Baby Tugs."" The title says ""Care Bear Cub with Video"" but you can clearly see in the photograph that it is a book not a video."
2,Not worth your time,"I was disappointed with this cookbook because instead of coming up with creative ideas to reinvent these dishes as vegan, the author simply calls for ""vegan cheese"" in nearly every recipe. Not only is vegan cheese gross and very rarely truly vegan, but it raises the question: why buy this cookbook? I can substitute vegan cheese in all the vegetarian Mexican dishes I know and essentially have the same repertoire.Other than that major flaw, some of the recipes are good and seem fairly authentic. I think the other reviewers mentioned it is a very boring layout with no pictures. But the bottom line is that it contains very little you couldn't come up with on your own. I would say don't waste your time with this one."
3,A vegan taste of mexico,So far everything I've made from this cookbook is good. The only problem I have is in the measurements - but I work around that. The only reason I only gave it a 3 is that many of the recipes I just wouldn't actually try - so it's a personal thing - not anything really wrong with the book.
5,Love the Meguiars NXT,"I love the NXT products by Meguiars, that all I use now when it come to detailing my car"
5,This is what all car washes should be,I have 2 new cars and as such I was very concerned with retaining the new shine on them. I started using RiteAid Baby body wash (the only ph balanced alternative available locally) and then found this. Works great and is a lot cheaper than the baby body wash.
2,How to Wash Your Car,This product relies on a fancy name and bottle design to sell; it's not that great. Less expensive brands will work great if you use the right technique to wash. After 12 years of washing my car I have developed my own style that works amazingly well.1. Get a lambs wool mit.2. Fill one bucket with clean water and a second bucket with car wash water.3. Wet down your car to loosen the dirt.4. Lie your lambs wool mit on top of your car and pour a little car wash water on it.5. Scrub down your car and then rinse the mit in the clean bucket of water.6. Rinse the car off with the hose.DON'T EVER PUT THE MIT IN THE SOAPY CAR WASH WATER! You will just get the water dirty and end up scrubbing your car with dirt. Your wash water will stay sudsy and foamy. This product as well as any other car wash will work just fine if you use this technique.
2,good,"This product is not as good as the zip turtle wash and wax, is it not make much foam. so does any other soap foam for car, do not leave the brightness as it does the wash and wax zip."
5,Excellent and easy to find,"This wash is better than 95% of the washes on the market today. It beats several washes that cost twice as much and are only available by mail order. I like that it is easily available at most retailers in the US, it is relatively inexpensive, and it effortlessly lifts the grime off the clearcoat. It has a pleasant grape-like smell. The foaming action is superior. P21S and Zymol are excellent, but this one is as good but costs less."
2,Didn't care for it...,"Bag looks and feels cheap to me. I bought it as a gift and didn't end up giving it. Wouldn't recommend, sorry."
3,The name says it all,"I bought this book because the title is my daughter's name , so had to have it. The book itself is OK. I'm not in love with the artwork and the story was pretty basic. At first couldn't tell if it was being told from the elephants perspective or the girls. Finally decided on the elephants. After reading the authors notes I understand the reason for the book. Anyway only bought it because of the title. We read it ofton but not one of our favs."
5,The Sweetest Book I know!,"My five year old daughter loves elephants, so when we saw this book, we thought we'd give it a try. We both fell in love with the friendship described in this book; the yearning of wanting one's fantasies to come true. The surprise ending gave us both goosebumps. Although we have tons of books, we love to snuggle up at night to read this book, ""...and dream of Emma Kate."""
4,Friendship can come in all sorts of packages,"4.5 starsSo, I pretty much loved this book! I think I loved it even more because of the semi-based-on-a-true-story-ness of it.An elephant is the best friend of the darling little girl in this story, and we get to see all the various things Emma Kate does with her best friend.I love the illustrations - how the elephant is amidst a world of color (because she's gray, or perhaps another reason).I also love that the book doesn't really say if Emma Kate's friend is real or not. It leaves it up for the reader (or listener) to interpret, which I think is great and will open the book up for much younger listeners.Definitely Recommended!"
4,Rotors are rotors,"Rotors are rotors. Do note that the 'sample' image used here does not reflect the product. These rotors are solid rotors. Obviously ordered a pair of these for the rear discs on my 2005 mazda 3i. Rotors went on smoothly and no sizing issues. In the end, they do exactly what they should, stops the car."
3,A pleasant surprise gift in a small package,"If you really go for some Action moments accompanied by few worth watching performances along with some good music served with a little drama, then Mitti might turn out to be the right choice for you too."
1,"Uh, boring.","Be warned, all this disc is is a sample of Andy repeating the words ""Uh, yes, uh, no"" over and over again. Mildly interesting from a conceptual standpoint, but certainly not worth the $12 bucks I got suckered into paying for it. END"
2,Shoes don't stay put!,"Regardless of how I orient my shoes and sneakers on this shoe rack the shooes/sneakers slip off the smooth slippery round metal rungs. FRUSTRATING! If you are only using these with shoes that have heels this shoe rack is fine. Otherwise, I'd recommend purchasing a different style."
4,helped our newborn who was songested,We originally purchased this item to take with us on trips to relatives's houses. We also remembered how our 1st child had a hard time adjusting to the size of her cradle. She alsmost felt unsecure in it and spent many days in her car seat or bouncy. Our second child needed this since he was congested and it helped keep him elevated and comfortable. It was our source of sleep and his source of comfort for nights when he couldn't breathe properly. It's a great must have!!! Vibration helps soothe babies as well.
3,Cute but not practical,"This bassinet is absolutely adorable but not useful for too long. My daughter slept in it for the first three weeks, but then started to squirm to much. It simply was not big enough. Just seems like a lot of money for the little use we got out of it. There is very little padding and I didnt feel comfortable adding extra padding due to S.I.D.S. I would recommend purchasing a pack n play with a full size bassinet that snaps on the top. You will get much more use for your money."
4,The Bodyguard From Beijing,"I just saw this movie, only now it is called ""The Defender"". Excellent action scenes; however, more gun play than fighting which is Jet Li's strong point."
4,The Bodyguard from Beijing,"I loved this movie with Jet Li. Jet Li plays a bodyguard from the Beijing secret police, sent to Hong Kong to protect a pretty girl that is very high maintenance. Snobby at first when Jet turns her life upside down by restricting all her activities and making her home a prison but after Jet saves her life; she turns around and becomes more likeable and agreeable and even tries to seduce Jet who is his usual stoic persona. (sigh) He is such a hottie! The movie shows Jet being as terrific with a gun as with his fists and kicks. My main complaint was the poor translation in the subtitles. I kept going ""Is that what he or she said?"" And the parts with the nephew got a little old. But if you are a Jet Li fan you will really like this movie."
2,"Too many guns, thank you","Chow Yun-Fat and Jackie Cheung (no, not Chan) are supposed to have guns, not Jet Li. His physical talent is absolutely wasted in this film in which Jet shoots probably 25-30 guys but only has one real fight. That ratio is way, way backwards for a Jet Li film. ..."
4,Not REALLY a martial arts movie,"I have the american version called ""The Defender."" The dubbing is HORRID, but I appreciate not having to read subtitles more than most, so I put up with it. The story is quite impressive (if you can get past the despicable dubbing), which makes the action more dramatic and important. The few action sequences aren't all that stunning, but the one at the end is outstanding. Most of the action is with guns. There is a kung-fu fight at the end that is pretty cool, but they put the bad guy on a wire, so it doesn't match the rest of the movie which shows Jet Li doing all of his stunts without one (even though he really should have had one) But that is forgivable too. All in all, it's a very complete movie."
4,This is a Re-Release of The Bodyguard from Beijing,"Be aware that this video is a re-release of ""The Bodyguard from Beijing"". Don't buy it twice. I did and with the exception of the nicer DVD Case there are few differences. This is an OK Jet Li movie, but not his best. Long on romance and short on action. Good one to watch with the women of they're Martial Arts refusniks."
2,Bodygaurd from BORjing,"If you are a person who, like so many others, has caught on to the Jet Li trend, then rent this. It is not that good, in plot or action, but it has some cool stuff. If you are just looking for a martial arts flick, or a good Jet Li vehicle, then check out Black Mask, The Enforcer, or Fist of Legend(which I highly recomend)."
3,"Okay, Not Great","I'm a big fan of Hong Kong action movies, but Bodyguard from Beijing was merely okay. Jet Li stars as a doughty tough bodyguard from the mainland hired to protect a spoiled rich girl from Hong Kong. Sparks fly when he tries to restrict her movements and jet-setting lifestyle. The two eventually fall in love, despite the fact that his new girlfriend is already the mistress of a wealthy man.I liked the film, but didn't find it anything to shout about. The girl's nephew Billy was way irritating. Jet Li was handsome and there were some great martial arts feats but this DVD was nothing to write home about. 3 stars. Average."
2,"Great movie, Terrible Quality!","All I can say is that this is film was awesome! Christy Chung and Jet Li have a lot of chemistry together. I can see the sparks fly between the two stars making it a very interesting romance in the film. What really shines is the action and suspense. The mix of martial arts and gun fights was refreshing. The moves were done to perfection. Even though the story wasn't deep or orginal, this was a great movie. However, this DVD had some of the worst picture quality I have ever seen. The color and clarity was poor. Almost half the screen was cut up and the other half was filled up with big text subtitles. The Trailers were cut up scenes just put together in a sloppy sequence that didn't flow at all. Overall, this version is no better than the VHS if not worse. Major disappointment for a DVD."
1,YAWN.........,"wow this movie really sucked! dont' listen to the others if you are expecting a breathtaking movie with romance and action, believe me you will be very very angered by the purchase of this film! AT MOST rent it and mute the television whenever the little kid is talking. Wow the bad guy was damn lame, the plot was damn lame, and there are at most 2 FIGHT scenes. The rest is gun shooting crap.....i'm sorry but isn't Jet Li a MARTIAL ARTIST so i would think the director would at least put him in more Martial Arts scenes....all in all what a complete waste of my time..what a piece of garbage"
2,Stick to the fight scenes,"I'm an avid Jet Li fan, I've seen Fist of Legend, Black Mask, Twin Warriors, Lethal Weapon 4, and The Enforcer. Out of all the movies I have seen Jet doesn't use guns, but in this movie he does and it does nothing for his reviews. There is only two action scenes in the whole movie, with only one containing martial arts. Now when buying/watching movies of this sort, you're not looking for Grammy Winners, but for more of martial arts. The last complaint I have for this movie is that its subtitled and not dubbed. When I first started watching the movie I thought this may be a problem, but after seeing the lack of fight scenes it didn't really matter. This movie is a big disappointment."
2,Jet Li is boring in The Defender,"I am a HUGE Let Li fan and I watch ever movie he releases. I usually rent it, watch it, then buy the DVD. This movie is an exception, it is not worth $1. I like Jet Li for his spectacular martial arts and unique style, especially with the great camera angles, etc.If you'd like to see Jet Li starring in a soap opera, get this movie. If you want to see an hour of boring dialog and laughable (supposed to be serious) acting, get this movie. If you like Jet Li for the same reason I do, leave this DVD out of your collection, buy Fist of Legend or Black Mask, or ANYTHING but this!The final fight sequences are great, but they are only 10 minutes or so of the entire movie that's worth anything. So if you don't mind spending the cash for 10 minutes of entertainment, then go for it.The 2 stars is for the final fight sequence, otherwise I'd give it 1 star."
1,not worth buying,"I saw this movie when I was little and liked it, and I have always been a Jet Li fan. When I received the dvd I was looking forward to watching it. The quality is horrible!! It was just dubbed from vhs and it is kind of blurry. Wish i did not purchase this."
5,Jet Li In Action,This is an action packed Jet Li movie with a hint of romance and suspense. However this is not your regular martial arts flick but it delivers action with lots of gun play and thrills. It has it's hilarious moments too. This is one Jet Li film for your collection.
5,The lexicon of all navigation information,"One will find this book in every chart room on every U.S. Capital ship, Coast Guard and Navy alike. One would expect to find this book in every seabag of every professional mariner. If you are a professional mariner and don't have it... get it! Get it?"
5,"If you do not know about this book, buy it!",I am a professional Capt. and I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to become a proficent mariner.
5,warm christmas,"What a wonderful Christmas CD! Perfect to play for christmas gatherings, adds to the mood with out ""steamrolling"" it. Beautiful violin that relaxes and warms the soul. Highly recomend this CD to make christmas day serene!"
2,But you picked him,"Whenever I read one of these ""Hee Hee Hee Let's look foxy while we hate men!"" books, I can't help but say YOU PICKED THE GUY!"
1,"No, not so funny","So the title of this book seemed hokey, but after reading some of the reviews included here, I decided to give it a whirl. After all, who doesn't need a good laugh after a horrible, miserable breakup?The bottom line, however, is that I just didn't find this book funny -- not even mildly amusing. Take, for example, a selection of ""Sassy Scoops"" offered by the author for coping with your ex:-- Post his number on the campus bulletin board as ""pizza delivery.""-- Trust your inner guidance system. When that little voice in the back of your head tells you to kick his ass, go for it.-- During a post-breakup shopping spree, cute shoes qualify as a ""need"" and not a ""want."" Pick up any pair with a heel. They'll make you appear taller and thinner and give him an instant height complex.Funny? Your pre-teen sister might think so, but to me, it just seems juvenile."
4,saved my life,"This book seriously saved my life after my breakup. It made me feel like I could get my life together again and for a while I felt like a truck had hit me. It also made me laugh so hard at some of the things going through my head. I'm giving it four stars because I think that some people might prefer a more clinical approach to dealing with a breakup. I personally did not find the clinical style books to be very helpful though. I liked this one because of the advice, but also how it helped me formulate a game plan for getting through this experience. If you have a good sense of humor, you will really really like it. I also recommend Letting Go, by Cabot although it is very clinical. It would be a good one to get in addition to this one."
4,Affirming,"This book is overall a gem with good suggestions for recovery and a lot of humor. It is probably a book for the college set but I am twenty-eight and really enjoyed it!The best part about it is that it made me realize I'm not the only one who feels crazy during a breakup. I also felt like despite the obvious sarcastic bent to the book, it did have positive things to say about men. It is not a ""let's be bitter forever"" book. It's really all about having fun and feeling good about yourself.I thought this passage was key: ""Remember-though it is hard to get over someone you really care about, it is even harder to spend your life in an unfulfilling relationship."" I keep reading that phrase over and over again and it has really changed my perspective on my breakup."
1,Horrible,"After I broke up with my boyfriend (whom I lived with for almost 2 years,) I was devastated. I read this book, among many others, hoping to find some comfort or insight into the process of breaking up and grieving (with also a little humor!)Instead, this book insulted me with its immaturity. In the first chapter, the author writes under the headline ""Sassy Battle Plan"" to ""secure embarassing photos of him to use in the future.""I mean, if you only saw a guy once or twice and are just feeling a bit annoyed or if you still find high-schoolish ""schemes"" funny, than maybe this is the book for you.But if you are looking for any kind of useful advice about grieving and moving on, this is not the book to buy. I would recommend ""The Girl's Guide to Surviving a Breakup"" instead..."
4,Kick that losers butt...in Divalicious style!!,"Having been unceremoniously dumped after three years with my now ex I was left feeling uncertain, lost, alone and totally bewildered, and among other things wanting him to pay for what he had done to me!I purchased this book six months after the break up and it has helped me get beyond that horrible in between phase. Already being a diva myself lol, before, during and after my ex, this book helped me to regain that diva feeling that had been trampled. The way this book is written it definatley makes u laugh and put things in perspective.It's great to know that all those stages I went thru are totally normal and that I'm not going insane.I'm now ready to re enter the dating world and have a clearer understanding of what I will and won't accept thanks to Alison James and her fantastic take on men and broken hearts!Oh and I'm over the whole kickin his butt stage..I'm a Diva beyond such things..and he just ain't worth it!!"
5,Wahoo - No more bad guys,I loved this book. It is hysterical and helpful. It describes every emotion I've been going through and made me feel like I can handle things again after being totally down in the dumps. Every girl should own a copy of this book.
1,Sassy?! Diva?! Give me a break!,"This book attempts to teach a girl how to be a ""diva"" during the post break up period.Question: ""How is taping an envelope with a bug in it on your ex's door nob"" a diva move?Question: ""How is jumping into rebound sex"" with a stranger a diva move?This book is very different from the idea presented in ""It's called a break up because it's broken"" and personally I agree with everything in that book says.While ""It's called a break up because it's broken"" shows how to truely get over someone, this book merely shows you how to drown in your own anger and do stupid things that hurts both yourself and innocent others."
5,This is the BEST breakup book ever!,"Don't waste your time with ""Its called a breakup because its broken"" or ""Don't call that man""--just pony up the 12 for this book and get going with your life. This book is all about dealing with the drama of the breakup, reclaiming your own life, and not wallowing and being desperate. It also deals with what do to when your ex wants you back. There is no reason not to buy this book; its fantastic. It will help you and make you laugh at the same time."
4,Divas & Cosmopolitans,"Not your ordinary breakup survival guide is right - although I am still mourning the end of my almost 2-year relationship, I was in stitches reading this. James offers razor-sharp wit, such as, ""If a man calls you 'psycho', it's his way to cover up what HE did wrong."" HA! I love it. Although I would never employ the body-maiming suggestions (dunk his head in hemorrhoid cream - voila - he's gone!), I did need the laugh. If you want to hermit yourself, that's ok, but take this book to bed with you. You'll be glad that James sheds the light on how men really think, and reminds you of the diva you really are."
5,Straight-ahead solution.,"My 1 ft. cable was too short, my 6 ft. cable too long to permit an optimal connection between the iPod in my shirt pocket and the speaker in my pants pocket. I didn't see any 2 or 3 ft. mini-connector cables until coming across two retractables--this one and a more popular model with right-angle plugs. Right angle plugs can be a mixed blessing--potentially more secure but also more problematic when it comes to insertion into a device encased in leather. I decided to forgo the angles and play it straight. The cable fits great and doesn't pull out."
5,This saved my home movies!,"I finally got around to transferring my 8MM home movies to digital and was crushed when the tapes wouldn't play. I had the camera cleaned once and it played the tapes for a while, but then quit again. Bought this cleaning tape, which isn't easy to find any longer and it worked beautifully! I was able to transfer the remaining tapes without any difficulty."
3,The Legacy of Merlin,"In the Legacy of Merlin Prue has been asked to go to England to find medieval books for a collector. When Piper and Phoebe come with her Phoebe starts dating a man named Niall. Prue and Piper are extremely suspicious of Niall and although they don't approve Phoebe continues dating him. However, when an old lady that Prue knows goes missing right after Prue saw Niall and a different woman speaking with her the sisters must intervene. With some investigation the sisters find that Niall is a victim of the strange lady's and the sisters will have to go back in time to Camelot to save him.I didn't like this book as much as some of the other Charmed books. The book advertises going back to Camelot but only two of the sisters go and they're only there for about 25 pages."
2,Can't Stop the Copying,"This book was not at all great. In fact this book was a take off of the 1945 book called ""Walking Slowly Fast"" It was about 4 witches from the 19 hundereds taken into Merlins past. One of the witches falls in love with Merlins son and she wants to take him home to her time but she can't because if she does it will change te history of the past, if that happens she might not even be born. So all in all I thought the book was good but the other was better. The TV show is also better then the books."
4,Charmed ofCourse!,I liked this book alot! It's funny and alot like the show!I can't wait to read more of these books!
1,Snores,I sat down with The Jenny Muck and (...) was able to put it down. Flowery language. Boring self-indulgent text. Gloating syntax. Dribble drabble.
5,loved it,"The previous reviewer was probably right - for a person who is not a judoka and has no clue about the sport, this DVD won't make much sense. But for a big fan of judo, it is great!!! You'll love it!"
1,Product shown is not what you get,"Product shown has metal hinges which is what you want to purchase. Product you receive will have plastic hinges and those hinges will bend and break over time. I would recommend going to a local store and making sure the hinges are metal so the toilet seat will last.I spent 7 dollars less than I would have at Lowe's, but I will be replacing the toilet seat in a year or two. Not worth the price."
5,Much nicer than the cheap plastic junk off-brands,"This is a WOOD seat and should last forever. It is of high quality and is comfortable for an average 5' 9"" x 200 lb. man.It is never cold as plastic seats can be And there are no humidity issues as with plastic seats which seem to be wet a lot.ho wants to sit on a wet toilet seat?Yes, it does have plastic hinges and bolts but they can easily be changed out for brass if you like. But I like the plastic hinges as they are the same Linen color and they don't look gaudy or 50'sish. The bolts are snap covered and hidden for a clean modern look too.You usually get what you pay for in life, in this case you get a bit more.You get real quality from the World Class American Standard Co...I don't use cheap chinese, mexican and korean garbage in MY home."
5,Great for anyone interested in crystals.,"This book is not only great for the novice but for the beginner as well. There are no pictures in this book but you can easily find pictures of each crystal on the internet or in other books. It's full of great information, check it out!"
2,Text from the Sixties Beautiful People genre,"Touchy-feely language, and lots and lots of it, tends to bury the valid insights of the basic data. Gifts from the earth most definitely have power, but I have found that not all people react to the same stone in the same way. I prefer to find my own way rather than wade through the gushing affirmations. The author seems to pick almost at random meanings to be assigned to the minerals and stones, except for the obvious attributes long assigned to pink quartz, rock quartz, elestial crystals, etc. If this is a legitimate field of inquiry (i.e. the study of rocks and how they affect us) then serious and strenuous research is what we need, not ladies running around in long dresses and dreaming up ""pearls of wisdom"". The earth is infinitely complex and needs -- and deserves -- a more dignified approach. I actually tossed this one out, when usually I give my unwanted books to the Library. Not a good book to give you real insight into the field."
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased this book because of reviews from various crystal healers: this book comes highly recommended. However, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be. In fact, I'm rather disappointed with this purchase.The book contained No pictures. Common, what type of crystal reference book leaves out the pictures? How are you supposed to identify the stones? Also, the author appeared to ramble on to fill in pages. This wasn't the worst , but it certainly wasn't the best."
4,great!!,"this book kept me facinated - i only wish there were pictures to identify the stones she is talking about - a small color one beside the definition (thou some have many colors). she does provide a detailed description. but many stones look a like to me.i hope her subsequent books can help me here. i have many stones and crystals and i still don't know which is which for many types of crystals and my other stones - even a drawing of the different types of crystals would help.other than that, it has a wealth of information on every stone you could imagine and written in a readable format. she writes a great description of the chakras.this book is many books in one and totally worth the purchase. i will purchase her book of pictures in hope that it helps me identify what i have in my collection."
5,Excellent resource. No Spiritual library should be without it.,An absolutely brilliant piece of work. I refer to it often. Simply is one of the best resources on metaphysical properties of stones ~anywhere~.
1,"lacks organization, generic entries","This book is far the worst crystal book that I have. I am a former English teacher, and the entries are poorly written, lack organization, and so generic that it is difficult to find any distinctions between stones at times. (Is there one stone that is not ""good for meditation?"" or that wasn't in the breastplate of the high priest?) The bright spot of the book is the number of stones that it discusses, but without pictures, volume alone is negated. It reads much as a collection of research from other sources all dumped together without any attempt at organization or rewriting. An appendix with a summary chart of stones and their primary functions would have helped this book tremendously, since the individual entries are so difficult to follow. Ideas are repeated in many entries, and this book is so difficult to use that I intend to get rid of it soon and find something more concise and user-friendly."
5,Fascinating book! I keep going back to it all the time!,"I have always had an interest, but no real knowlege of crystals. This book has been a tremendous help. It's all raggedy and dog-eared by now. I can't stop peaking in for yet more information! And always I learn something new. It's a great book for anyone interested in all aspects of crystals."
4,Really helpful,This book has really been helpful in looking up and understanding crystals. A friend of mine had this book about 6 years ago and I wanted it. Now I have it. Thanks
4,was thinking there would be pictures of the crystals,"very good information, though to help with identifying the crystals/minerals by sight, you need the companion book: Love is in the Earth: Mineralogical Pictorial (which, at this time, isn't sold directly from Amazon but new and used from various sellers). Since there's no See Inside Preview, I wasn't really sure what the deal was, I had envisioned this book having pictures. Just wanted folks who haven't actually seen the books to know that they seem to go hand in hand if you, like me, like to have a visual reference along with the properties/attributes."
4,Very thorough,"This book is very good at explaining everything about crystals, about their necessity, about the reason why we need them to help heal, calm and balance with that part of nature. I purchased this reference book along with the Crystal Bible. They make a great pair. Love is in the Earth explains everything about use for all crystals, zodiac sign of each crystal, the forces and body parts affected by the crystals and I'm very happy this manual was recommended to me for use. No question seems to be left unanswered.So whether you're a novice about crystal works and healing, or someone very comfortable with the practices, this book is good for learning or just refreshing your memory."
5,Love Is In The Earth,"I bought this book as a gift. I ordered it ""used"" & there is no way to tell it isn't new. My friend loves the book & I thank you!"
4,Love is in the Earth,"This book is quite comprehensive although there are a couple of omissions with regard to some crystals - having said that, the book is invaluable as a reference for the majority of crystals. The indepth information is easy to read and logical. It is an excellent reference book for the crystals that it contains."
5,One of the Best,"If you are looking for a book with EVERYTHING in it about Crystals, Minerals and stones, this is the book. There is so much info in this book that I would consider it the Crystal Bible (for lack of a better word). It is a must have for any Naturalist or Mystic looking for a book to aid in studies and just to have for spells, rituals and health information. Blessed Be All..."
4,Considered a Bible...,"This particular ""Melody Book"" (other Melody books cover other ""facets"" of stones... like color pictures, application of stones, etc.), is about as comprehensive a book as one could hope for, regarding the metaphysical properties of particular crystals and stones. It's very rare that you'll find a type of stone (no matter how obscure) that isn't listed here.My only beef with it is that stones are more individualized with what they're suited for, than Melody would have you believe. (For instance, all of a certain kind of amethysts aren't suited for exactly the same thing, and the same goes true for all of any kind of stone...Still, it is pretty much ""the encyclopedia"". (I'd also highly recommend, ""Stone Empowerment"", by Jane Hightower... Not as comprehensive, in terms of covering ""all the stones"", but it has practical info (including cautions) that simply doesn't exist in the Melody books."
2,dissapointed,"I thought this book would have practical uses for my crystal Healing experience. However I'm afraid the author has more knowledge of Narcotics, and Woodstock than knowlege of the Mineal Kingdom. Sorry to be so blint, but You can learn more from the web than the ""Hippie Pilosophy"" found within this trash.May the spirit of Earth be with you"
1,There is a reason that this was a B-movie,Sleazy caged women flick gets points for casting Grier in villain role as sadistic lesbian guard. Skippable except for extremely devoted B-flick fans. Part of Roger Corman's Women's Penitentiary series.
5,Big Bowie Fan,"I owned this book back in the mid 80's, but it came up missing. I recently ordered it again just to have as a collector's item. Excellently written and puts Bowie in perspective up to 1980. On a side note, I take it Bowie has retired from recording(I'm sure he has plenty of things on his plate), because he hasn't recorded anything since '2003's Reality'. He's iconic. He's not going anywhere."
2,not pleased,product cut a lot smaller than other products i own of same size. it looks nice and i would recommend it to my mini friends
3,"t/a, t/a, and yet more t/a","Well, what can I say in here that wasn't mentioned in the title. A bunch of hot chicks want to save a restaurant by wearing binkinies, and we get to see them change into the bikinies and out of bikinies and pretend to make hot love without the bikinies. Well, it's an ok rental if you've seen every other movie with naked chicks in the video store, but othrewise, it's just boody. So not worth the 50 they are asking."
1,Little T No A. Worst T/A movie I've ever seen.,"Please, please don't buy this video. If you're the type that slows down to watch an accident scene and cannot contain your curiosity, rent it.Its a big tease about 3 waitresses and their artificially endowed assets. And that too for less than 10% of the movie. I watched it for 15 min and fast forwarded for the next 30. I couldn't take it after that. Your neighborhood beach is probably more erotic. The worst Playboy movie is better than this.And the digital transfer to DVD! Really bad!"
1,The service is lacking here,"Amy Lynn Baxter stars as Judy, a former actress trying to run a struggling vegan eatery. Needing a substantial amount of money to keep the landlord from shutting her down, Judy's cousin gets her to enlist the aid of Marilyn Chambers (who Judy worked with in other movies), to try and turn things around.While I love both B-flicks & Amy Lynn, this movie was difficult to watch. The acting is harsh, even by B-flick standards and the jokes either don't make sense or just aren't funny. (Like Judy's cousin purposely sabotaging the food orders. Why?) The nude scenes are decent but you will find your attention wandering soon after they're over.Unless you're a real big Amy Lynn or Marilyn fan, pass on this."
4,Just one issue,"I like this tool. It came with an abrasive blade, so plan to buy a diamond blade. The only design flaw is that the kill switch is located close to the handle. With gloves on I keep grabbing it and accidentally turning it off."
4,Coming out in a closed society,"Well made film on how teenagers of smaller cities and towns of Mexico deal with coming out. The acting is good and the story is simple, but interesting."
4,To burn the ships,"My title is the direct translation of the spanish title. We hear this sentence in one scene and it is very significant for all characters. In order to move on, one must once in a while forget about the past.""Quemar las naves"" is a coming-out story, that takes place in very religious Mexico, which makes it even more luring. The centre plot focuses on the life of Sebastian and Helena (siblings) and their dying of cancer mother, former pop singer, Eugenia...If you look for cheap blue scenes or a lot of naked flesh, I am gonna spare your time. Don't watch it.For all others, ""To burn the bridges"" is a moving, romantic, well acted film. I enjoyed it enormously."
4,My son loved it!!,"Bought this for my 4yr old for halloween & he loved it. I took him to an event & there were a few Captain Americas in the crowd, but none like his costume. You will probably get 3-5 wears out of it, depending on how rough your lil one is, as the padding in the upper part of the costume does start to fray. I saw other reviews that complained of this problem, but its a costume! Not for every day use, I mean cmon. Overall I was very satisfied & so was my superhero:)"
3,Captain America costume,"Costume mask contained a flaw where it was stiched above the left eye causing the eye to be somewhat shut and lop-sided. After some work to carefully remove the stitches, the mask is now usable."
4,Just what he wanted,"My 5 year old grandson loves to dress up in different costumes. I found different Captain America costumes available; this one appears to be best..it has ""muscles"". He has a 2 year old little brother who also received a Captain America costume from his other grandmother, the quality of it pales compared to this one. The only negative I can see is the ""wings"" on the hat/mask. They sort of flop around and don't really stand out like they do in the picture..my grandson did notice that. I wish the costume came with the shield, but it didn't, so if you are considering this costume be sure to purchase a shield for it."
4,Great Costume!,"My son loves this costume! Its looks just like the picture. the costume seems pretty durable. My son puts it on once a week to play ""Super Heroes"""
1,the hood was not included,"the costume did not come with the hood, I am very upset. I do not recommend this purchase, I bought for my nephew because he wanted the hood and it did not come with outfit, and the price is crazy"
5,Another great Classic from Getz Litwin and Gilbert,"These three great authors are the best. If you are a serious access developer you must read this book. Covers all areas as well as some topics that you never knew you could do with Access.There is loads of great source code and examples. If you get only one piece of code or only one tip the purchase price is well worth it. The amount of time you can save developing with the tips in the book is unbeleivable.If you can do it with Access it is covered in this great book.These three great authors are very well respected in the Access developers community, and the book is well written. It is also well organized, and you can find pertinent information easily.This book should be on every developers desk and referenced to daily!"
2,Close to useless,"Buy this if you are completely lost or aren't much of an analytical thinker. Otherwise, just type ""help function"" in the command window.I never really needed to open this book, but did so on occaision for curiousity's sake--not very clear on a lot of areas, you learn best by playing with the program."
3,Works....sometimes. Don't get it if you have a Macintosh.,"Bought Matlab. This company spends more time/resources making sure you don't steal it (ie allowing you to install it on your own computers hassle-free)...then it does in working the bugs out. It is advertised as working with Os X....GOOD LUCK getting it to run right. This stupid program was so important that I had to run out and buy an Intel iMac..Install that Bootcamp/Windows OS ""thing"", and install Matlab on the pc side so that I could have stable environment. This P.O.S. is NOT Mac compatible... Sooo...having said that....whatcha think?Dear Matlab Folks: drop the RETARDED activation scheme which ONLY hurts LEGITIMATE users ( you can find lots of cracked versions in the newsgroups btw) and make this program WORK."
1,Wrong item,"Nothing to say except it was not the item I ordered. They are balls and they are round, that is about as close as they are to what they were supposed to be and no resemblance to the picture. Probably just picked them off the shelf and shipped them because I had to follow up 2 days later to see why they had not shipped already."
1,Do not waste your dough!,I totally agree with the other review. This is not for beginners whatsoever. Every single aspect about this VHS tape was horrible. From the instruction (which was pretty much NONE!) to the lighting. Sorry I bought this tape which is going to end up in my yard sale.
2,Not for beginners,Each movements isn't taught and there is minimal instruction. It's assumed that you know how to do each undulation and movement. This video just puts together short routines for a few short workouts. They have a dance at the end of the video that doesn't have much relevance as it isn't instructional and a bit long...it's also very dark and hard to view so it's not too entertaining.
1,No good.,It sucked. Simplistic speedy beats made on a cheap keyboard. That's the impression this track left. Was looking for a progressive trance track and mistakenly ordered this CD. Discarded it after going through the first time.
1,He who pays the piper calls the tune,"Its clear that PBS got more than its money's worth in paying for the misinformation about Garvey presented in their ""documentary"". With all the effort made to show Garvey in less than a favorable light it would seem that PBS is afraid that he has made good on his promise to return in ""the whirlwind or the storm"". There was so much that could have been in this film. The organization he founded, the UNIA-ACL, is still in existence with members around the world. His influence on African Independence. The fact that the Red, black and Green flag came from the UNIA-ACL. With all that was left out of this film it leaves me wondering, ""What were they documenting?"""
3,poof! the psuedo imperial grand dragon has been slayed,"News flash Ted, white documentaries are glorified too, so stop crying.......................idiot!"
5,The Best!,"Despite by dermatologists thoughts, i am a sun worshoper. I have tried multiple products for my face & this is absolutely the best. It gives a dark even tan w/ a touch of SPF. Took bad you can't find it in the stores."
3,Bain de Soleil Orange Gelee,"I ordered this because of the quality I remembered and the SMELL. IT DOESN'T SMELL LIKE IT USED TO IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. Still the same color and so on but no ""odor memories"" came back when I used it."
5,Amazing product!,"My first exposure to this product was as an adolescent around the late 80's. My mom used to pick it up in the discount section at the local drugstore but then it disappeared from the shelves. For my sister and I she would use the Orange Gelee and my brothers, who are fair skinned, just the Bain de Soleil sunscreen. Both excellent products. Despite it's disappearance from the shelves, I always remembered the luscious smell and awesome tanning abilities. I am 1/2 Vietnamese with a naturally tan complexion but this product really brings out a warmth of color in my skin and makes it appear incredibly sun kissed. I'd buy a case of it if I could!"
5,Bain De Soleil for the best tan ever!,"The availability of this product is becoming increasingly scarce. I hope it's not taken off the market! I was able to find the Gelee in the Summer of 2011, but it was nowhere to be found (checked CVS, Walgreens, Walmart & Target). I was glad to find it on Amazon. I like to use the Bain De Soleil Gelee SPF 4 during the late summer months when the sun is not as strong. This formula gives me the best tan and I get so many compliments! I love the scent and the moisturizing formula. Some of you may remember the TV Commercials back in the 70's and 80s--brings back so many memories!"
4,Sunscreen Lotion,It is actually my wife who purchased this product. She has used it for many years and finds it gives you a nice golden tan. You don't need to stay out in the sun for hours to get the results you want. Would recommend this product to anyone.
3,suntan gel,"This is my all-time favorite suntan gel. Even though the formula has changed, (I liked the old formula better, it was easier to apply) I still use it."
1,A Major Disappointment,"The first three books of the Earthsea Trilogy were phenomenal. They were stirring high fantasy that stand as masterpieces. Then Tehanu came out and collapsed the whole thing.I don't know what issues the author was struggling with, but it would seem that the tone of the book is one of bitterness. Judging by the harsh tones toward men, I can only assume a divorce or death. It is unfortunate, if this is the case, that the author could not filter her pain in a more creative manner, instead of wearing it like an open wound.I am very disappointed in what destroyed a wonderful series."
2,Feminist Revision?,"I've seen a number of feminist reviews here. I suppose that's all well and good, and I applaud thought wherever it occurs. I just can't understand what would motivate Ms. LeGuin to geld one of my favorite, genuinely benevolent male characters in order to make her brutal-yet-fuzzy political statement. For that matter, I won't forgive her."
2,Out of place,"I suppose Tehanu is a decent book in its own right, but I don't know what inspired LeGuin to try to add it to the Earthsea trilogy instead of just making it a completely different story. She removed almost everything which made the first three books so great."
3,Weak Link,"Yes this book is the weak link in the Earthsea books. As others have pointed out, it is more mature, more philosophical etc etc. However it is also deeply disappointing. The characters are not as bold as they once seemed and basically i see this book as a feminist manifesto mixed in with a bleak kitchen sink drama with some complex social iossues thrown in. It isn't the deep and complex fantasy that the other books were. This book is best known for being the one where Tenar and Ged finally get it on."
1,An Unfortunate Turning,"This book is an unfortunate ending to a really excellent and imaginative trilogy. It's very disturbing to have a character (Ged) whom you liked and respected robbed of any dignity and reduced to a whining loser who can see no better way than to wallow in self-pity and scrabble around in the dirt and herd the goats. Why did the heroine abandon what she was offered--learning and wisdom that might have helped improve the world--to become a boring housewife? Only the dragons maintain their original charm. This is supposed to be a great feminist novel. Well, please note that the positive social change here is still in the hands of a man--the young king. A very sad progression on the part of the author."
1,"""Feminist"" manifesto?","I don't know about other readers, but I found this book to be incredibly antifeminist. Forget about what Le Guin did to poor Ged. What is feminist about taking the character of Tenar--a former priestess and student of magic--and sticking her in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant? Let's not assume that every book that deals with women is automatically a feminist work.Besides that, Le Guin seems almost embarassed about the Earthsea books. If that's the case, why not just leave the trilogy as it is?"
2,Boring!!,"It is as boring and developed as the second book. Hmm.. could I start a new journey with the quests of Lebannon.. or, could I write about everyone becoming farmers.. The emptiness between the pages is so mind-blowing since it is so obvious what the deal is with Therru. Feels too much like a sell out just to make a couple of bucks off a new book while sacrificing a legacy."
2,A disapointment,"The first three books of the Earthsea trilogy we magnificent works of art. The were real fantasy with adventure and danger and a real foe to fight. Tehanau was nothing like them. The characters hardly travel. All the magic that capitivated readers seems to have faded. This seemed to deal more with a woman's place and where it should be. I think that what LeGuin is trying to say is true, woman should have equal rights. But when writing a series you have a duty to the readers to make the series flow, to give them what they want. Tehanu did not do that. Perhaps this series should have ended with The Farthest Shore. I wish LeGuin would write more stories of Earthsea in the flavor and style of the first three."
