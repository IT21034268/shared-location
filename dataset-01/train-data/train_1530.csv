2,"2 stars for style, but zero for function (for me) - be careful","Hard to write a review for an item that doesn't work for you. I tried to use this rather stylish KVM with a MacMini and a PC running XP-sp2. This is the USB variety, and the switch would work with the PC, but not the MacMini. I think the problem is that the Mac has a DVI output for video, but even with the DVI/VGA adapter that is supplied by Apple for use with VGA monitors, it still refuses to send a signal that my VGA monitor could understand. I've kept the KVM because you never know when a KVM will come in handy, and at the price I can't be bothered to return it."
3,2 Port KVM switch,This works great with my laptop and personal PC. I use dual monitors and have one for work and one for personal going at the same time. I push one button and the mouse/key board flip to the other PC. I don't use the VGA cable part because I have two monitors. Great simple and straight forward product.Josh
1,Buyer Beware,"Purchased one in October, it worked very well 95% of the time as long as I didn't want sound with both computers (sound never switched over) until June when the button stopped working. Also found the wiring very difficult to work with since the hub is between the computers and the button."
1,"Nice idea, bad execution","This product is a great idea, and a very simple user interface, not to mention it look nice. Unfortunately, it didn't work with my windows laptop nor my Linux system. I have had much better luck with the Connect Pro 2 port KVM usb switch and recommend you consider that product instead of this one."
1,Could be better,"When connected to 2 computers' the computers must stay on. If for any reason you turn off one computer, the mouse and keyboard stop working. Not what I expected. Quite disappointed. It takes too long to recognize the keyboard and mouse."
3,Don't expect a lot.,"My main complaint is that the switch gets ""confused"" if one computer reboots. This happened to me when Microsoft sent and automatically installed a security update and then took it upon itself to reboot in the middle of the night. I had to shut both systems down and then reboot the main computer first and then the second.The desktop switch for switching computers is a nice thought but feels a bit flimsy. I don't know how long it would last.Then audio feature seems a bit useless to me. It doesn't actually swap the audio output of each computer. It just keeps the main audio turned on. I didn't experiment with this feature very much.In summary, I didn't like it and returned it. My main concern was its confusion after a reboot."
2,Not for heavy use.,"If you only use this once or twice a day, or don't mind unplugging and replugging your peripherals in a couple times a day, go for it. I flip between two machines repeatedly throughout the day, and this switch is not reliable. I understand and can handle the delay when switching, but having to mess with the usb ports a couple times a day at minimum is irritating."
2,Not Reliable,"Belkin Flip worked for a couple of months, then quit. The light on the unit went out so the mechanical switch no longer works. I did download the software to flip via the keyboard but I don't like the way it works. I once inadvertently flipped it to my docking station when my notebook was not docked so had no way to flip it back. If your in the Market, try the Rosewill KVM. The flip mechanism works much better and smoother than the belkin and it was MUCH cheaper though it does NOT have the sound option."
2,Purchase something else,A friend gave me this to use for my laptop and PC. It will not work unless both the pc & laptop are turn on.
2,Standby doesn't work,"This product works except if the computer trys to put the monitor in standby mode, it doesn't work. I am returning the procudt."
2,Its Not what is Described,"Saw some descriptions of this product and decided to buy it. Well.....it turnout not to be true. The items doesnt work with two computers. The changer button doesnt work, You have to manually change the cords from one computer to another which kills the purpose of the product. If I want to manually change like that I wont need the product then. NOT WHAT IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED!!!!"
3,Belkin F1DG102U Flip 2-Port KVM Switch with Audio Support (USB Connection),I returned the items. The shipping is too long. It takes 10 days for me to get it. I decided to buy it at the local store
1,Does not work with Mac Mini Intel,"Awful product...My Mac starts ok, with the initial mac bios screens - but then the monitor goes to sleep and never awakes...Should have read the reviews before purchasing..."
1,Do Not Buy If You Have a IMAC & IBOOK,"I bought this product to hook up my IMac & IBook. In the specs it said it would work on a Mac OS, so thought it would work. When I brought it out of the package I knew right away that it would not work based on the cables. Got in touch with Belkin and they said that it would not work. I told the rep that they should put that in the information since a lot of people are using Imacs now. He was not that responsive. Now the product is all boxed back up to be shipped back to Amazon."
4,cool product....but,"Nice design but who really cares much about the aesthetics of a kvm switch.It's convenient when it works but I have had some intermittent problems. I have two relatively new computers and undock my laptop daily. Trying to reconnect isn't always straight forward and it does require a full shot off, then reconnect, and reboot.But for the $, it's nice to use a big screen and keyboard with access to my laptop software /data.I don't know of a much better product out there for the same functional purpose and $."
2,Could Never Get It To Work,"Used this product to attempt to share a Samsung monitor, Dell keyboard, and Logitech mouse between two machines: one XP and one Win 7.We could never get it to work reliably. We ended up giving up and ordering a TrendNet, which worked right out of the box.We liked the concept of the Belkin button-click switch between computers, we just wish it would have worked!"
1,Completely useless,It works for a while then it quits. It gets out of sync. I liked the idea of the remote button instead of installing more software / hotkeys. But it simply doesn't work reliably. And the delay on the USB is obnoxious - three to six seconds. I hope I can find the receipt.
1,Very disappointing,"I like the idea of just having the small switch on the desktop with no software to install, but I've since disconnected it. It ended up locking up the keyboard and or mouse so that I couldn't work on a regular basis. All of a sudden, it would be like a key was stuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. I would definitely not recommend buying this KVM switch."
1,Worst KVM Switch,Bought this KVM switch and upon installation my Logitech MK 520 keyboard and mouse combo was not recognized by the motherboard's bios. Belkin says to try another keyboard and mouse. Tried 4 other keyboards and mice - same results. This is the worst KVM switch I have ever seen. Sent back for refund and bought the TRENDnet 2-Port USB KVM Switch Kit with Audio TK-209K. The motherboard immediately saw the keyboard and mouse attached to the computer - works flawless on every boot.
5,This thing works great - No Drivers Needed,Works without drivers. Reliable product (I have purchased 3 of them). A must have for someone working with two PCs and one monitor. Vendor delivered without problem at a good price.
1,Buyers Beware,"I bought this just the other day, and I couldn't get it to work at all. After a few hours of reconnecting the wires, I figured out that it is REQUIRED to have the usb or ps/2 connectors (depending on the type of Flip switch) connected to BOTH computers in order for this to work. It is not just a VGM cable that works without all cables plugged in. I bought this for two notebook computers that I wanted to hook up to a bigger monitor, while using each notebook's separate keyboard and mouse. If you're buying this, make sure you've got the extra usb or ps/2 ports to plug it in, even if you don't want to share a mouse and keyboard."
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,"When I first plugged this thing in, it was great. I was amazed. I have used switches like this since the late 80's, and there were always problems. So I was surprised about how well this worked...then...two months later it started to lock up - unable to switch. Complete shut down of both computers for 5 minutes is the only way to clear it. I contacted Belkin - no solution or recourse. This product was new to the market when I got it. It needs more R&D time."
2,Flip locks up and won't switch,"I find that at least once a week, my Flip won't switch and is somehow locked up. The only cure for this seems to be to unplug both USB cables and let the unit power down. Once it is back on it works again for a while, but it is a major pain. I have to crawl under my desk and find my USB ports. I have much cheaper KVM switch with PS2 plugs that is has never given me a problem."
4,Solid Product,"This KVM switch delivers a simple solution to sharing a keyboard, mouse, and monitor. The sound capability is an added bonus. This product gets the job done, and the button on my desk makes it easy to switch between my personal PC and work laptop. One undocumented feature is that you can switch computers by simply clicking the Ctrl key twice (discovered by accident)."
2,Worked for a while,"It worked OK for a while, with a little delay. Then I replaced one of the computers, and now it will work with one or the other computer as long as the other one is turned off. Not exactly a convenient situation. I'm going with something else."
1,Doesn't work with Dell 4700 and flat Panel 1905,"Well, darn. When I connected my monitor to the KVM and then to my PC.. nothing. Not switching cables, not pressing the flip switch. Sorry to say, couldn't get it to work at all."
3,Great anime but cheap DVD case,"I love this anime because of its great stories and qualities. But the DVD case is really cheaply made. It's very difficult to get the DVDs in and out. The first time I opened the case, a piece of plastic fell out. I will give the anime 5 star and the DVD case 2 star."
3,False Advertising,"this is advertised as ""Ghost in the Shell: Complete Collection"" which to me means both movies and both seasons of the anime- but once I received it I see that it's only ""Season 1 Complete Collection"". TOTALLY BUNK DUDE"
5,Anime that isn't stupid,"I'm not a fan boy of anime, but this is one of the best anime series in terms of story, theme, characters, originality (it even has an episode centered around an internet chat room), and runs a gambit of emotions at time (funny/sad). It's also very accessible to Western audiences, being sort of like a Tom Clancy, and a mix of other thriller best-sellers. Highly recommended if you like ""24"", Tom Clancy, and cyberpunk.Shame that it wasn't more popular."
5,the legend of the white whale continues...sort of.,"i sometimes tend to read books with concurring themes..such as ahab's wife, moby dick and this book which a very handsome bartender named william let me borrow when i was finishing moby dick.i think it's great to jump from contemporary fiction to classic fiction to little known (to me) sci-fi. i really got into this book and enjoyed the lush visual imagery and the sailor's new adventure in a new, unique world."
3,Old Pro's Give you some entertainment,Typical story that just doesn't match reality but works fine at Christmas because we want music and dancing anyway. If you can handle the story the music and dance will make you feel good all over.
2,Not Quite What I Expected,"The DVD I got was in excellent condition, but it was Going My Way and Holiday Inn on the same disc. It was also the black and white, not the remastered color version, of the movie. I was hoping the ""Special Edition"" would be in color."
3,Holiday INN,"This was not what I expected, but I will watch it sometime in the near future. I do enjoy black and white movies and Bing Crosby was my favorite actor"
3,"Boring, but music and dancing ok","Watchable, but it looks like they spent too much money on this before the war. It had USA propaganda in parts, and really wasn't realistic. The best thing this has for it is some of the dancing by Astaire and singing by Crosby. The storyline left something to be desired."
2,"Not nearly as good as ""White Christmas""","I wish I had read all the reviews for this movie, and not just seen the first four. Holiday Inn is OFFENSIVE, and I can't believe anyone can watch this movie without feeling totally uncomfortable with the portrayal of African-American people. If I had known more about this aspect of the movie, I would not have bought it. ""White Christmas"" is definitely the movie to buy, as it is truly a Christmas movie, and it is sweet and charming in every way. Holiday Inn is frustrating in that Fred Astaire spends the whole movie trying to steal his ""friend's"" fiancees. Overall, this movie is not worth the money."
2,No plot - but enjoyable musical numbers,"Holiday Inn is a pleasant film to watch after an exhasting afternoon of holiday shopping. There is no real plot, but the musical numbers are delightful."
5,I want to stay at HOLIDAY INN..,This a a great movie and I love it in Black and White but it was also not bad in color..I usually only like movie the way they were first printed..but I can understand why they would want to make this in color for all the people nowadays that won't watch a b/w film..love the music and dance numbers..
4,Colorized version is good,"I remember enjoying this film on TV when I was young. Previously had a black & white version DVD, but had trouble getting anyone else to watch it with me. When I saw the collectors edition with a colorized version disc, thought it would be worth a try. I probably will never watch it in black & white again, the colorized version is better, and I can convince other family members to watch it then..."
5,BEST HOLIDAY MOVIE!,"I love this movie! The Inn is so lovely I want to build a replica and live in it! I am so happy that this wonderful movie is now in color. Of course some outdated racial themes are in the movie--but that was in 1942....shows how far we have come! Fred Astaire has some great dance numbers with Marjorie Reynolds coordinated to each Holiday. It shows the wholesome values of America during WWII, and it takes me back to a glamourous Hollywood created adventure. Christmas is only a part, albeit the best part, of the entertainment. I recommend it highly."
5,Holiday Inn,This has been one of my favorite Holiday movies for a long time. I would suggest this to anyone who loves the holidays.
5,Holiday Inn DVD,"We just watched it last night. Wonderful movie. You can see a lot of similarities that were later used in White Christmas. Loved this movie, will watch it often. The clarity is great, however for your own test, glance at the ""trailer"" on the DVD which was not remastered and see the major improvement in the visual since the original."
5,A core recommendation for community library video collection,"Holiday Inn is the video presentation of the classic movie featuring the music of Irving Berlin, starring Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, that first performed the all-time favorite song ""White Christmas."" An enjoyable comedy about two talented men who find themselves in hot competition for a woman's favor, Holiday Inn is both wonderfully nostalgic and brightly entertaining in its own right for contemporary viewers, having stood the test of time and come through as appealing as ever. With a running time of 1 hour, 41 minutes, Holiday Inn is a core recommendation for community library video collections and a ""must"" for fans of Irving Berlin, Bing Crosby, and Fred Astaire."
2,Yep ... better .. BUT ......,Why on earth they did a good remaster job on this and NOT bother to restore it also .... I'll never know. This is my one of my all time favorite movies. But I do have a different release of this on DVD and I'd much rather watch it - then be reminded that Universal botched this one. There are obvious places in this edition that are SOOO annoying visually - that are not even in the other DVD's - makes me wonder why go to all the trouble to remaster a lesser quality print of the film. *sigh*
5,One of my favorite movies,This is a great movie! It was a good price on here and in good condition when I received it.
2,racist relic,"some great dancing, of course, but the black face number was appalling and the plot line was silly. i can se why they took ""white christmas"" and gave it a better vehicle."
3,Holiday Inn,"This is what you expect to see when you have the magnificent dancing of Fred Astaire -- pure joy! I'm just not a big fan of Bing Crosby but Marjorie Reynolds was surprisingly talented. I didn't know that she could dance. If we could see more of Mr. Astaire's dancing and have a little less of Bing Crosby ""crooning"" bah-bah-bah-boo I would have enjoyed the movie much, much more."
5,Nastalgia!,"Who doesn't love old films with great actresses/actors! Really loved this film and could watch it once a year, really. Thank you."
5,Holiday Inn,.. great purchase! i was very happy with this purchase and would recommend to any one interested in buying it.
4,Loved the dancing and music but I understand why it is not shown on TV,I had never seen this movie and ordered it simply for the musical aspect (I love watching dancing and singing). I was wondering why they didn't play this movie on TV during the holiday season until the one scene where the music and dancing were done in black face - yikes! I get it! Jeez...if you can deal with this type of old movie craziness then you will probably like the movie.
2,Not one of the best,"This movie's main draw is, it was the movie that the song White Christmas was first introduced in. It has a disjointed story line, and is poorly written, but is saved to some degree with Irving Berlin's music. It is in Black and White, which too bad because it would have been better in color, but they didn't make many color movies at the time. Murder mysteries are often better in B & W as it adds dramatic effect, but this is a fluff movie and color would have helped. My recommendation is to pass on this one and buy White Christmas, which is a very good movie."
3,"An interesting alternative if you've seen ""White Christmas"" too often...","If your holiday film viewing includes the movie ""White Christmas,"" then you may enjoy this classic where the song ""White Christmas"" actually made its debut. The plot is a flimsy excuse for showcasing numerous Irving Berlin songs (many of them very forgettable) and a few Fred Astaire numbers, including the famous drunk dance in which he was, in fact, none too sober.There is a fair amount of racial stereotyping, including a perfectly horrible number with Bing Crosby in blackface. Some of the songs are atrociously poor, to the point of being laughable. But for pure historic interest as the predecessor of the much lovelier movie ""White Christmas,"" this is an interesting film to watch occasionally."
3,Holiday Inn,"I thought I was getting ""White Christmas"" this is an earlier version and not worth the price - get the newer edition ""White Christmas."""
2,It was my mistake....,"However, when it is posted as a Special Edition, with. Color enhanced cover, I assumed, stupid me, it was the colorized version"
5,Must have seasonal movies,"Holiday Inn ,Christmas in Connecticut and White Christmas are three great movies to watch around Christmas and New years. All three are great additions to any movie collection."
5,A holiday treat,"Holiday Inn is just that, a holiday treat. It has in it two of Hollywoods historic stars, bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. I remember seeing it when it first came out and, since then, on TV. Now I can watch it at home whenever the spirit moves me - and I expect that will be often!"
4,Wonderful Holiday Movie!,"What would Christmas be without this wonderful movie? Bing Crosby, at his zenith of fame, sings the Irving Berlin classic, ""White Christmas"" and throws in several other dandy songs to boot. Fred Astaire also dances his famous ""firecracker"" routine which is possibly his greatest solo dance in any movie. Astaire's incredibly versatility and atheleticism are showcased throughout this movie.""Holiday Inn"" has everything: humor, great songs, Astaire's timeless dancing, Bing's inimitable baritone and it's guaranteed to bring a smile to your face."
5,Holiday Inn ( 3 Disc Collectors Edition),"This is a superb set, the best colorisation I have seen yet (along with ""It's A Wonderful Life""). Highly recommended."
5,Cute Story,Great Christmas story. This movie takes you back to a time when life was slower and times were easier. Like it!
5,Holiday review,"The product was exactly what I expected and arrived on time and in great condition. This was a DVD with two movies, so I got a bonus."
5,Holiday Inn,"This is a GREAT movie but this disk did not work in my DVD player, the player kept returning 'not compatable'. I don't know why. I gave it to my niece to try in her machine."
4,White Christmas,"What a fabulous movie! Take the night off, slip in the disc and enjoy family movie night. You'll watch over and over"
2,"dated, only significant for song White Christmas","This is a classic in terms of the introduction of Irving Berlin's song White Christmas, but the 1954 retooling as ""White Christmas"" much better. A reminder that 1940's were a long time ago."
4,Christmas Classic,"Great Song and Dance with stars of yesteryear.......what a way to get into the spirit. We played it for our Christmas open house and on other occasions.. Everyone really enjoyed it. Great for company, especially older relatives that may be visiting over the holidays....they will remember and enjoy! Nothing commercial out this CD."
1,"Wow, racism is fun now?","Yeah, it may have been cool back in the day, but racism is stupid. People who like this movie like racism. You should be ashamed of yourself. Liking this is like being a fan of Triumph of the Will; you like things that are terrible."
3,holiday inn,"good clean holiday movie bing and fred are great together agood family movie , a classic. an oldie but a goodie"
5,Hanover and Mason,"My, what a show. Crosby and Astaire's rivalry makes this a Christmas classic. This special edition is good as well."
5,Best Christmas movie of all time. Right up there with its a wonderful life and white Christmans,We really love this movie. Wouldn't be Christmas without watching this during the Christmas holiday. Love the remastered DVD version.
2,Cheesy and dated...couldn't finish it,"My wife and I wanted to watch a holiday themed movie that was good, clean, and fun. We had seen the talents of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire before, so we decided to rent Holiday Inn. The movie had a thin plot line and gags which were not funny. The singing and dancing talent was amazing, but not enough to carry the movie. We stopped watching half way through. If you want to get a glimpse into what was considered entertainment back in the '40's, this movie is an example."
4,Comments on One Special Night,"This is a very touching and moving film. Even my husband, the battle hardened Marine Corp pilot, thought it was a good movie. He was surprised that it did not come across as a ""chick-flick"". It has humor, tender moments, and some twists and surprises along the way. Great for family viewing. The acting was very good. This film addressed issues that many families and individuals face every day. It was also believable!"
4,Holiday Inn,Holiday Inn w/Bing Crosby - It is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies. I watch it every year.
5,Fun predictable movie with great music.,"This movie is predictable but fun to watch during the holiday season. Music is great and it is the first time ""White Christmas"" was sung by Bing ."
5,Great Holiday Film,"The original 'White Christmas'. Crosby, Astaire and the wonderful songs of Irving Berlin make this one of the best holiday films that capture the exuberance of post war America in the 40's. The chemistry between Crosby & Astaire was never captured by Crosby & Danny Kay in the sequel."
5,Old Movies,Holiday Inn is a prime example of Hollywood doing it right. Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire are wonderful as rivals for the same girl. Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore!
5,Ohhh...L I N D A Mason...,"The best Christmas movie ever made. Okay, so ""White Christmas"" is everyone's favorite classic Chrismas movie. Just double the fun as you enjoy the energy of the great lines, wonderful song and dance, and perfect storyline. Yeah, it's black and white, and that's why they made ""White Christmas"", but nothing will top this one. Enjoy this with your kids and show them what sophisticated humor is all about."
5,Can't go wrong!,The perfect holiday movie...the whole family will enjoy and sing along.Doesn't get much better than Bing Crosby during the holidays.
3,Holiday Inn Amazon Kindle purchase.,"Good movie overall. Clean and family oriented, but not what Christmas is about. Astair should definitely stay away from singing and just dance. I have never cared for his voice."
4,"Old ""Skool"" kung fu for real","The DVD transfer is really poor,,,however, the choreograpy certainly made up for it immensely,,which is why I gave this flick a 4 stars,,and not 5 stars. I really enjoyed this flick, absolutely amazing. Kwan Young Moon meets Hwang Jang Lee ( silver fox),,,AMAZING performance from both fighters. I do believe this is one of the few flick where the fox played a good guy, I could be wrong. However, it was an amazing performace from the fox!! Kwan Young Moon took this opportunity to really do his thing,,and he sure did. It would be a dis-service to say too much about this amazing flick,,,but I do reccommend you get it,,rest-assured you will not be dissapointed"
3,Direct stock replacement,"This steering shaft was an exact stock replacement to the one I pulled out of my truck that was rattling. It worked for about a week and the steering shaft was quiet, then it started rattling again. I read some reviews that had the same thing happen. Oh well, even after purchasing this shaft and buying the new improved design from GM, i'm still cheaper than what the dealership wanted to charge.My opinion is to just go and purchase the GM part and save the trouble. I will say though, that the shaft did work well and quiet for a week. Not long enough for me though."
1,Didn't last long,"I installed this about a month ago and already the clunking has started to return....very disappointed in this product, not sure if there is any warranty, but I wouldn't recommend. I was highly encouraged after reading the positive reviews, but unfortunately this did not work out for me."
5,Fixed my clunky steering,"So far so good on my 03 Avalanche. Fixed my clunky, loose steering.Took about 15 minutes to install and the steering is much more responsive now.I've had it installed for about a month now and it's held up well. Great price too."
2,poor design.,"this steering shaft is of poor design. the factory shaft is much better than this one. I installed it no problem, but the clearances were bigger then the one I took off. I don't recommend this item for any one trying to up grade to something better. ITS not!!!!!!!!"
1,Failure - Lasted about six months,"I bought a used 2004 Avalanche in October 2010 that needed a new steering shaft. I bought this part from Amazon, replaced it myself and as of late, I'd say the last couple of months I noticed a slight clunking which is now prominent and sounding like the previous shaft did.I suggest ""steering"" clear of this poor excuse of a replacement. Others have mentioned the dealership but I fear the cost would be high, however it may be justified if it doesn't fail as well."
1,Worked for only a short time,This shaft only stopped the clunking for about 2-3 weeks before it started clunking again. I'd recommend spending the extra money for the newly designed factory shaft you can get from the dealer. I replaced this dorman with the new version I bought from the dealer and have had it for 6 months with no problems.
1,Worse than OEM,"This steering shaft remedied the clunk in my column for 2000 miles. The original OEM part didn't start making noise for close to 60,000. I emailed Dorman with a detailed account of my troubles and received no reply. Poor quality, poor customer service, lost customer."
1,Faulty Item from Dorman-Not Amazon's fault,"I received this part to correct the infamous Chevy 2002-2007 ""clunk"" problem for SUVs (Trucks, Tahoes, Avalanches). This steering shaft is supposed to expand and collapse. However, this Dorman shaft was stuck and would not expand (should expand easily using hand strength). I am very glad I didnt install it first. Some users have also reported that Dorman had a bad batch of about 1000 of these. This is noting amazon did, its just an issue with Dormans QA process. I ended up ordering the original GM part from a well known GMPartsDirect dealer (pt number is 19153614). I would not recommend this Dorman Product."
2,New GM 19153614 better than Dorman,The recently introduced GM 19153614 is something like GM's fourth generation intermediate steering shaft for the Burbs and Trucks. It is redesigned and now superior to the Dorman which was an improvement over the early GM versions. I just installed the new GM and hope that this time they got it right!
5,So far so good,"Installed shaft as well as bearing in less than an hour, now my Silverado steers like new again. Time will tell about durability!"
4,Great Sound - Difficult Ear Piece and Controls,"I found this cd player to be really cool with the sound and I like how you can move around and the cd does not skip around. The only problem with this device is the controls are too small - I could not read the labels enough to understand what AVLS was nor could I understand the repeat button. When I went to look on the screen everything was so small it was ridiculous!The ear piece was another factor - It was backwards or something, I got it to fit my ear and all but there needed to be some sort of covering for the ear piece.I love it, except for those few things."
3,Poor sound quality,"I bought the white version of this CD player (which is exactly identical except in color), to replace a Panasonic SL-SX480 which was skipping too much.I'd heard great things about ""Sony Sound Quality"", and figured that this player would at least match or compare to Panasonic's D.Sound.It does not.In fact, the sound quality of this player is really quite poor until you turn it up beyond volume level 6, and you can only do that if you have AVLS turned off. At 6, it sounds pretty natural and solid, but who wants to listen at that high of volume all day long?At a more acceptable volume, it truly feels like you are listening to a cassette player. The sound is thin, brassy, it doesn't involve you in the music which you are listening to. I would have expected better from Sony.Because of this, I took the player back and bought a new Panasonic SL-SX480 instead...it may skip, but at least it sounds better."
5,Excellent product,"I gave this as a gift, person says it is a great little system, loved the earphones, fit so much better then the recently newer ones do.all and all a great product at an even better price"
3,Attractive package - hard to use,"Yes, it looks cool - it sounds good and works well, but what were these Sony engineers thinking? The controls are practically invisible. The beveled edge of the unit make the buttons unreadable. Opening the unit to insert a new disc requires picking up the unit to slide the latch over. If you plan to use this as a table top player - such as on your nightstand, forget it! Look at another model. But, the sound is clear and true, the bass controlled."
3,Churchill WWII,"The book set outlook is very elegant, although printing quality is lacking. Churchill's writing style is very smooth and makes the reading agreeable. Historically the only description of WWII from the political head of one of the fighting countries!"
5,An extraordinary man for an extraordinary time,"What a brilliant, shining human being. His eloquence and spirit were such that even his political enemies would stand and cheer after one of his rousing speeches in the House of Commons where he labored, often against large and scornful majorities, to wrest the world from lethargy and the denial of a growing Nazi threat. These volumes were not written by an academic years after the events... Churchill was the man who actually pulled off this extraordinary accomplishment. There is not much personal anecdote (see the diaries of Lord Moran for that). Here, you find an epic told in clear and compelling prose by a truly inspiring and brilliant leader. With others, I stand in awe. A terrific read."
5,Great used six vol set,We bought these used and they arrived in great condition. What a great way to learn about the Second World War. Wonderful gift for anyone who loves history.
5,A classic for the next millennium,"Churchill won the Nobel Prize for Literature, and it was largely on the strength of this work. It has been published many times, but ought to be reviewed as a set. Volume One of this set, ""The Gathering Storm"", is scarier than any horror movie ever filmed. Watch helplessly as decent people are drawn into the black hole of the worst tragedy that humankind has ever found itself in. You will notice that I ended this last sentence with a proposition. This reminds me of a story - one day someone nudged the Prime Minister and reminded him that he, too, had committed this offense against grammatical decency. Churchill's reported response was ""This is arrant pedantry, up with which I shall not put."""
1,Incomplete order,"I ordered ""The Second World War - six volumes"" and received one volume only. I really enjoyed the one volume I received."
2,It's not a set,I only received one book from the 6 volume set. The seller should never make the deal look like selling a set.
4,one part missing,"The only thing preventing this book from being known as the greatest of the 20th Century is Churchill's exclusion of ""The Great Lie."" Still worth every minute you spend reading it though."
2,Poor quality print.,"I've wanted to read Churchill's ""The Second World War"" but it has always been quite expensive.My daughter recently gave me an Amazon gift certificate that allowed me to buy the six-volume paper-back edition.Imagine my bitter disappointment when I started to read volume I (The Gathering Storm) and noticed the very poor quality printing in the book. By poor quality print I mean that in many cases, individual letters (especially the vowels a and e) were partially formed or had gaps in them.While the text was still legible, the small print and the deformed characters make it very uncomfortable to read.I would have expected a much higher quality product from Amazon particularly when the price is around $75.00.G. Shute"
2,Poorly written,"I bought this trilogy of books based on a friend's suggestion. I thought that they were poorly written, and really very boring. I got tired of this whole family and their secrets very quickly. Save your money!"
2,Nothing spine-tingling about this book!,"""Spine-tingling"" appears on the front cover of this book. There wasn't a blessed thing that tingled about this book. There was absolutely NO mystery to uncover - everything was MOST predictable. This was a ""love"" story from beginning to end. I don't know about anyone else - but when I buy a ""mystery/thriller"" - I want some mystery and some thrills - other than those in the bedroom!!! I really MUST stay away from women ""mystery"" writers - they all have the tendency to throw in WAY too much ""romance""."
4,grear,First trilogy of hers I have read and enjoyed it. Its an easy read that keeps the suspense throughout the book - same for this trilogy. A page turner and full character descriptions.
1,DO NOT BUY-RIP OFF,Repair tech went out of business...i don't even know why amazon is still selling their product!! Do NOT BUY!! Google it people. Repair tech is dodging people who are trying to get claim their warranty!
3,Barely got it!,"I ordered a used book. The book it's self met my expectations of a ""used"" book. The shipping methods were less than desirable. The hard back book was sent in a thin standard office yellow envelope; by the time I got it, there was very little envelope left from the shipping process and weight of the book. I am fortunate the mailing address was still in tact."
4,Good so far,"I only gave this 4 stars so far just because I have not had the opportunity yet to listen to all of it. However, so far I have enjoyed it. Just listening to MJ in his own words. There are some things that I have heard before and some things that I have not. If you enjoy just listening to interviews then I would recommend this collector's box."
1,Defective in the box,"When I received this and opened the box, the battery cover would not stay on once I placed batteries in the compartment. The only way the mattress would blow up would be when I held the cover on. The pressure of the batteries would not let the clasp connect and hold. As soon as I removed my hand, the cover popped off and the batteries fell out. This is the case even before one could sleep on the mattress!!I am sending the mattress back ASAP! It's poorly designed."
4,Wenzel Airbed Review,"I bought the Wenzel Airbed to replace a Coleman inflatible bed that had a leak. We use inflatible mattresses when the whole family and grandchildren visit. I did find that the built-in manual pump was not worth the effort. I used a Coleman battery-run pump on the new airbed, but found it too slow. I then bought a Coleman electric pump for $25, which pumped the Wenzel airbed up in a matter of seconds. The airbed maintained its air pressure and comfort for an entire week. An adult weighing 170 lbs. slept on it every night and got a good night's sleep. I'd recommend the Wenzel Airbed to anyone needing extra sleeping space for family visits."
2,"Comfortable, but not Durable","When I got this mattress, I was quite happy with it in the beginning. The manual pump took some time to get used to, and pumping up the bed was a good workout, but the bed was very comfortable. However, during my second camping trip, the mattress started leaking. Once back home, we discovered that it had broken right on the seam. We tried to fix it, but the way the mattress is constructed, it was impossible to put any patch on the area, and we had to throw the mattress out.I have an 8-year-old son who walked over the mattress several times during camping, and once jumped on it, and I'm sure this contributed to the leak. Under normal, gentle usage, it may hold up. Still, I feel the mattress was poorly built, and would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Great Product if not stored,"Very prompt delivery and was very happy when used it first time but after I stored it for few months and then tried to use it again it had a hole, I tried to plug it with the repair kit, that did not work. So if you do not want to use it frequently it is waste of money."
1,air mattress deflates immediately,Hi I purchased this to stand in for a temporary mattress and unfortunately in my new apartment with no other mattress I filled it with cool air from blow dryer...built in pump is manual. Anyway no sooner did I lay down but with in three minutes the air is out of mattress and I am sleeping on the floor. Unhappy...I took a chance purchasing on internet and now will have to figure out how to return this while sleeping on a wood floor. When it is briefly inflated I can see that it wasn't a bad idea on my part just a faulty product delivered.
2,New Formula? Big Disappointment...,"I have used this products for 6-7 years and always loved it, until today....I ordered this from Amazon and received it a few days ago. First I noticed a new label on the tub. OK, but then as I scooped out my first scoop I noticed a color change..instead of being the color of something like Nestle Quik powder my protein was a very light shade of tan...bad sign. Still, I gave it a chance..after mixing and tasting I felt duped! Different texture and WEAK flavor - where did my rich Cocoa flavor go? I could have picked this product out of a blind test after having it every day for that many years.... the new version is awful....did I just get a bad batch? HELP."
3,Not bad but not great,"The protein is high quality and appears to have all the right ingredients, but the taste isn't so great and it doesn't create a very thick shake. I prefer Met-Rx whey protein over this, as in my opinion it tastes better and keeps me full longer."
3,"It's Just Okay, Would not Buy again","When I first opened the sealing off this product, I saw how thick the powder was. Compared to ON Whey, which mixes very well, this requires a lot more shaking and as you can probably tell, clumps a lot more. I bought the Cookies and Cream flavor, which I thought was just okay. If you're looking for a good tasting protein, this is not it. If you're just looking to mix it up, stick with the ON brand (Which in my opinion, is the best due to consistency of flavor and mixability)."
3,This Is NOT muscle milk,"typed in muscle milk in the search bar and this popped up, with a pic of a muscle milk can. It got to my house and the can was not as it was in the pic. it was the normal cytosport with yellow and white."
2,Nutrition label incorrect on website,"I have been using this product for almost 2 years now and when I received my tub with the new label, I noticed that it has 120 calories. The ""old"" label listed 90 calories. On Amazon's website it lists 96 calories - which is correct? It may not sound like much of a difference, but it needs to be accurate. What else is incorrect???"
2,"Good specs, but bad reception","This phone looks good on paper: 2.4 GHz, digital answering machine, call waiting caller ID, digital duplex speakerphone on base and handset, 50 number memory, etc. But when it comes to clarity and reception, this phone is terrible. The answering machine message playback and the speakerphone sounds are muffled."
1,Don't buy this one!,I have exchanged two phones and am on my third one the box says 11 days standby five hour talk time. It is more like 30 minutes to 1 hour max. Love the features but can't live with the Battery problem.
1,Can't hold a charge,"This phone would be great IF IT COULD HOLD A CHARGE! But, alas, it can't. After charging for 2 days straight, the most I can get out of this phone is 30 mins of talk time and then it dies without warning! I've contacted customer service and they were useless. They wanted to know everything and anything under the sun before they would even consider looking at the phone. Moreover, they want me to pay to send this junk phone to them! Don;t buy ANYTHING from Panasonic. Period."
2,crackle...chrackle..crackle.....,On the second phone now. still have a lot of background noise. Had a 900Mhz phone before this and should of kept it.
3,Bells and whistles may not be enough,"Another example of call clarity being sacrificed for loads of features. Not only are voices muffled in your ear when using the phone, your own voice ""crackles"" with slight static at the other end. This phone does have it all -- Caller ID/IQ, answering machine, headset jack, handset speaker phone, etc. But if you put a premium on clear reception and transmission, keep looking."
2,"Poor Battery Life, Handset and Base Memory need separate","Like many of the reviews already here- I have had the poor battery problems. The talk-time has steadily decayed, and even when the phone was brand-new it never held-up to the claimed 5hrs in the manual.Another annoyance is the fact that the handset and base phone memory need to be programmed seperately. i.e. each number you want to store has to be entered twice!The speaker phone seems to be poor too- the other-end almost always has problems hearing you."
1,Only if there was a option to select 0 star for this product,"I've tried this phone two times, just because of its rich features, but Panasonic being the big name company like it is has failed me both the times.If you forget to remove the handset from the base unit for a day or two, you'll be doomed (like ppl don't go on vacation). After leaving the handset on the phone over a day, it blew up something in the phone, now every time I try to dial a number it wd keep sounding the dial tone like it didn't accept the key. Also, ppl calling me can't hear me while I can.I exchanged this unit from the store, thinking a surge or something might have caused it & installed a surge protector with it, but to no avail the second one also ended up with the same problem.Now, I can't even return it as I am over the return period & the customer service is of no use, they want me to pay for shipping & handling to their service centre for a repair or refurbished unit. ..."
1,Terrible quality - don't waste your money!,"This phone is not worth the money! For starters, the battery will not hold a charge and the phone gives no warning that the battery will die. In addition, the reception quality is horrible - is constant static. The speakerphone is a nice feature, but it is difficult for people to hear you on it. Stay away from this product."
1,Can't hold a charge,"The phone comes with lot's of features (and expectations). However, after charging the unit for 20 hours, the battery was dead after 30 mins. of use. Customer service is non-existent. What good is a phone if it can't hold a charge?"
2,"too many features, but terrible reception","this phone has terrible reception. purchased thinking to use it on the main floor (as a prime phone), but ended up using it as a spare phone when all other phones in the household are dead. even the ""static reduction"" device (or whatever its name is) that came with this phone doesn't help much... i finally got rid of it. 900mhz ""sonies"" are much better!"
1,Complete Waste of Money,"The battery on my phone, as well as other reviewers', lost its charge very quickly and completely died just a few months after I bought it. I can not find a replacement battery anywere, locally or on the internet. Panasonic can't even replace the battery. Also, Panasonic's customer service is not lacking, it is non-existant. Do not waste any money on this company."
2,Lack of clarity,"I bought the Panasonic because I have one and am very happy with it. This phone also had all the features I was looking for. We are just starting to use the phone and find that the person being called finds the caller's voice very hard to hear. It doesn't matter whether you are using the handset or the speaker phone. Unfortunately, we are now outside the return policy of the store it was bought from and am hoping Panasonic will step up to the plate. I suppose this will turn into another example of a store just wanting your money without providing any service or usable product. Wish I had read these reviews first. It is unfortunate because the combination of features is great."
2,Something amiss with the battery,"I dont know what Panasonic have done here, but I cannot complete a long conversation (say 75 minutes) without the battery going dead. Lately, it has been far less than that. This is starting with a full charge. You would think that in a cordless phone this would be something they would get right. Unfortunately - it makes the telephone worthless - and I will have to return it. What a pity - I thoughtI could rely on Panasonic."
1,Don't buy this phone,"I really liked this phone for the first month I owned it. Now it takes 24 hours (or more)to recharge and it won't hold that charge. I will never buy another Panasonic phone. Customer Service is lousy. They know they have a problem, but won't do anything to help."
3,Where is Quality Assurance?,"The phone is kinda cool! We are taking it back, and based on our experience and other unfavorable reviews it will be a return, not an exchange for another one. Paid over $... at Costco for this phone. Never paid $... for a phone before. Never had problems early on like this! Problem? Noise! It's as if it's a pre-900 mHz phone. There's interference. It's bad enough for others to have commented on it and we've only had it about 2 weeks. Also, if I'm listening to the messages and pick up the receiver to call someone, the playback ceases. It can't do two things at once. Finally, the menus for turning off the ringer (so I can sleep) are somewhat convoluted. Otherwise it's a pretty cool little unit. Sad to have to take it back."
2,Do not buy this!,"This opera, is probably the best opera in the time of Beethoven. This opera is not very long, but her sister Leonore, is longer and much more beautiful, but Fidelio, is much more dramatic. The opera score here, is very good, no dialog, which is pretty hard because the recordings I have, are missing dialog, and I want to see the dialog itself. The opera score contains no table of contents, no instrumentation, and no notes. The opera score which i got, fell apart after two months I have used it, and the scoresmells a horrible smell. do not buy this score, it is cheap, but you get cheap."
5,Thank you!,"Thank you for putting together this beautiful catechism. It is very inclusive, easy to read and the illustrations are lovely. It can't help but lead souls to heaven."
3,Quiet little fan,"This fan looks great and is *VERY* quiet, but it doesn't move much air. The one I got stopped working after 3 days, and a replacement is on the way. Hopefully the new one will last a little longer than the first.Update: The second one lasted just as long as the first -- 3 days. I sent them both back and got a refund."
3,"OK, but ...","The fan is cute, but has some drawbacks: it doesn't oscillate; it doesn't generate enough of a breeze; there are no on/off buttons - rather just an awkward twisting control on back. The fan is easier to clean because it is open, but I'd rather have more ""spokes"" protecting the fan blades. OK for a work desk."
3,If you REALLY like Emperor...,"This is Emperor's first album and an EP of songs that they put out on a split with Enslaved. The sound for the first album, ""Wrath Of The Tyrant"" is very ""old-school,"" but also sounds close to absolute crap. I can see how there's some interesting stuff, but they really should have improved the sound because sometimes the drums get buried, and the vocals are a bit overpowering. Oh well, if you love Emperor, check it out, but don't be expecting good production."
1,Quality kills.,"The quality on this album is incredibly bad and pretty much ruins the whole thing. The instrumentals are okay and overall a lot of the songs have a nice symphonic sound, but the vocals are drowned out almost COMPLETELY by everything else. Sometimes I didnt even know if he was singing or I was just hearing a random sound put into the album. I dont think I'll buy anymore Emperor albums, since this was my first- but if I do, I'm going to make sure the quality isnt this bad.I do love the cover art though!"
3,"eh, the qualty kills it","i am not a big guy on quality of albums, and it usually doesnt bother me. however, with this one, i cant even listen to it, its just in my collection for the hell of it. the wrath of the tyrant demo (or first 4 songs) are actually pretty good, but nothing special."
5,Emperor reigns hell fire,"I JUST RECIEVED THIS CD BY EMPEROR,THEY AND MAYHEM ARE TRUE EVIL AND ARE ONE'S OF A KIND. BLACK METAL RULES...."
1,Why did I bother?,"This was an impulsive purchase to complete my Emperor discography. Yet, I highly recommend avoiding this at all costs or at least hearing it first before making my mistake. Some people love a production that is so poor you can't make out anything worthwhile, I'm not one of them. The entire disc sounds like it was recorded on a 4 track, the vocals are too loud, the drums sound like a drum machine, the guitars you can't make out other than that strange barely audible buzzing through each track.AVOID AVOID AVOID.I'm so thankful this band progressed to much greater heights than this."
2,Spock for president,"Didn't like the book. The most interesting character was over 70 years of age and had had a relationship last in France 1944. The hero-heroine pair didn't work. I had some moments when I wanted to find a baseball bat and hit the heroine. She was so complicated all the time. I gave two stars for Spock for president T-shirt and few good lines, like bat phone. But I had to force myself to finish this book. I like TDD-series but this one was totally different. Perhaps because I didn't like the hero a slighties bit. Well but his uncle... (the over-70-years-of age) that might have been an other story. Somehow this book was a mixup of terrorist, suspense and romances but neither of them."
3,A little too much going on,"I quite enjoyed this book but I think there was a little too much going on. Every time I started to get sucked into one of the stories, it would switch to a different story. I think Ms Brockman could have culled a couple of the story arcs and the book would have been better."
4,I LOVE S. Brockmann,"If you have never read any of Ms. Brockmann's books, you MUST try this one. Great story, great characters (esp Mallory and David!), great author. I have read all of Ms. Brockmann's work and she is truly great. When I purchase her books I can't put them down. In this book there are no main characters, all of Ms. Brockmann's characters play center stage. I strongly recommend reading this and catching up on other Suzanne Brockann novels!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The Unsung Hero,"After a near-fatal head injury, Navy SEAL lieutenant Tom Paoletti catches a terrifying glimpse of an international terrorist in his New England hometown. When he calls for help, the Navy dismisses the danger as injury-induced iaginings. In a desperate, last-ditch effort to prevent disaster, Tom creates his own makeshift counterterrorist team, assembling his most loyal officers, two elderly war veterans, a couple of misfit teenagers, and Dr. Kelly Ashton - the sweet ""girl next door"" who has grown into a remarkable woman. The town's infamous bad boy, Tom has always longed for Kelly. Now he has one final chance for happiness, on elast chance to win her heart, and one desperate chance to save the day...."
1,yuk,"This may be one of the worst books I have ever half read. It is touted as an action story. I thought maybe along the lines of Baldacci etc. Oh no it is a bodice ripper with interminable below the belt scenes ad infinitum. Anyone who likes an action spy story, beware. Grocery book shoppers, it's all for you."
4,Very good book,"Although I've enjoyed many of Brockmann's books, I wasn't expecting to like this one. Right of the bat, reading the reviews about the secondary stories kind of annoyed me. But the book was fantastic. I thought the main storyline was very interesting, but I also adored Daniel and Mallory. As for the World War II thing, I didn't get it. Was I supposed to like Charles? Because I didn't. Quite the opposite, and it had nothing to do with his unemotional ways, but more to do with the whole fact that...well I'm not going to give away the whole point of the story. But I really disliked him. The book would have been a billion times better without him in it. Aside from that, I loved it."
4,Best of Genre,"Those who buy this book expecting a typical genre romance will be surprised, and pleasantly so. This is a complicated story, a love story with three heroines and four potential lovers. Though the story is complex, it is handled admirably, and at no point does it strain a reader's credulity. There is the primary heroine, an accomplished modern woman, a secondary heroine who is a complicated teenager, and a flashback heroine. The flashback sections take place during World War II and are set in the French Resistance; these sections are printed in italics. The characterizations are plausible and the threads of the story are fascinating, woven together into a appealing tapestry. There is mystery, there is terror, there is sex. Ms. Brockmann is a masterful writer and poised to move to the head of her genre. This book holds the attention to the very last page."
3,I wanted to like this...,"I wanted to like this book since I see it recommended so often, but I could only make it about 3/5 of the way through before putting it aside. I don't mind side-stories in a book, but the ones in this book took too much of the focus away from the main story. There were too many, and they really slowed down the pacing. Another problem was the slow development of the hero/heroine's relationship. They had barely even gotten started (after *a lot* of drawn-out angst on the heroine's part) before I finally gave up. The WWII and other side-stories were well-written, and that's why I'm giving it the 3 stars, but the slow and fractured pacing of the book overall, as well as with the hero/heroine's story (which should've been front and center and exciting), resulted in me giving up on it."
5,Couldn't put it down,"This is one of those books that had me laughing and crying with the characters. The way this book was written was excellent. Ms. Brockman's use of a major plot and two subplots to tie the whole book together at the end was beautifully done. The sex was great, it was hot. I have read other books by Ms. Brockman and this is one of the best. Great summer read. Told my mom to read it. Job well done."
3,"Pretty good, but not good enough to continue the series","This book as a romance novel fit the bill, but I was hoping for a better representation of the military here, warts and all. There really wasn't anything about this book that warrants the title ""military romance"". I don't think the male lead had any characteristics unique to a military man, nor did the female lead appreciate his devotion to the military. I believe military personnel and their loved ones are a special breed and make a lot of sacrifices to do what they do. This book didn't shed any light in that respect. Having said all that, it was still a mostly enjoyable romance novel with no special accolades to speak of."
5,Unsung Hero,"I really loved this book and I can not wait to read the next book in this series. I love the story, the humor and the action!"
3,This Could Have Been Great....,"This was a very relationship strong novel but the problem is that the relationship that is the weakest is between the lead characters! Much stronger are the relationships depicted between the two older men, one of whom is dying, and the duo in their late teens, a comic book artist and his model. The two older men flash back repeatedly to their love for a French resistance fighter during WWII, which is a poignant story. The lead characters present my least two favorite plot points: they've had a crush on one another since high school, 16 years ago, and mentally lust after one another for, it seems, half of the book. This is also the weakest of her Navy SEALS depictions because it is just too incredible a coincidence that an international terrorist surfaces to sabotage a WWII ceremony in the same New England town where the hero SEAL is recuperating on convalescent leave ."
3,Good,Being new to romance novels the storyline was fantastic except at times I found it bit off puting as it jumps from one pair of characters to the next at times on the same page. saying that I truly loved the exiting adventure mixed with high passion and a truly exiting climax. Having bought the next few volumes in the Troubleshooter series I can see many great adventures ahead.
3,not impressed,"I had a hard time getting into this book. The flash backs of the two WWII men was way too much, I ending up skipping through most of it because I really didn't care about it! I wanted to read about Tom and Kelly but everything else took the most spotlight. Even the action development with the terrorist got pushed to the side because of the old men's relationship and history. The action was in the last few pages of the book. If there had been more focus on the hero/heroine relationship and the terrorist plot I would have given this a 5 star because it was well written."
3,an average read,"This book was an average read. The first half of it dragged. I found the flashbacks of the seventy year old romance to be much more compelling than the current one between the hero/heroine. The hero suffered from flat dialogue and characterization, the heroine from poor motivation. The suspense pacing was off, as if the author got sidetracked in the middle by building the relationship between the hero and heroine. The ending was satisfying, if somewhat unrealistic."
1,"Unrealistic, slow paced","A person who lived in the Boston area I love reading books about Mass. I found there were no elements or descriptions of the Boston area. But this is minor compared to the poorly developed plot plan. Although the book was about a a Navy Seal, the author showed no understanding of miltary protocol. When I read a romance I look for conflict between the heroine and hero, in this book I found none. I couldn't recommend this book to anyone who wants a good romance to read."
1,buyers beware,Contact any seller before you buy and ask if they actually have the CD-ROM with the book. Most of the sellers make no mention of the CD-ROM and the one I ordered did not come with it.
2,Constricting,"I purchased the Velocity 7 from Amazon after much searching for a suitable case for my new Canon 300D. I was attracted by the size (big enough to fit a 70-300mm lens attached) and interested by the sling style backpack.When I got it the size and style were very nice but the sling cuts too high across the chest and felt way too restrictive, so I sent it back. I couldn't imagine spending any length of time walking around with it on.For a coupla bucks more I purchased the Lowepro Off Road style belt/shoulder pack on Ebay and am very pleased with it."
5,Everything It Is Supposed To Be,"Performs exactly as I expected. Room in the center divider for my Canon 350D with telephoto lens mounted. Side spaces have room for 1 medium or short lens. Outside pocket has room for memory cards, filters and small batteries.Well constructed with adequate padding. Extra quick-release buckles on top (at the sides) thus top has three quick-release buckles. All seams are flawless and the material is water resistant. Extra internal dividers that attach via velcro.Two thumbs up!"
2,Not great,"I found this bag too clumsy to get in and out of quickly. It needs a zipper along the outside edge to give more unfettered access to the storage compartment. I kept it, but really am not using it. I have been looking for another solution and haven't found one I like yet."
3,"Nice bag, a little cramped.","I knew it would be difficult to choose a camera bag online. This bag is an excellent bag, extremely well made, with many handy options. I was in a bit of a hurry when I ordered it, and I found it just too small for my Canon Dig Reb2 35mm DSLR and equipment."
2,Too Small,"The description says it will hold a body with zoom attached, two extra lenses, and a flash. While that's all true, the bag was to be so tightly packed that to change lenses requires removing everything to find the lens you need -- not very convenient for nature hikes. Additionally, the case won't hold the camera with a flash bracket attached (I tend to leave mine on, since it make my camera easier to hold.)This could be a nice unit if you only have one extra lens, though. The padding is also very thick, so if you abuse your equipment, this might be for you."
3,Get the 7X instead,"I've had my Velocity 7 for about 6 months and while it's still looks pristine, I've gotten a fair amount of use from it. I disagree that it's too small, but then I have a Canon XTi, which isn't the biggest DSLR out there. That fits nicely in the center with the 17-40 zoom, between a 70-300 and the 50mm. There's even room for a gallon ziplock bag and a micro-tripod.Pros:* Decent amount of space* Good separators for the main compartment, with velcro to customize to your needs* Protects your gear so long as your reasonably careful* Easy to get to and not bad for pulling out your cameraCons:The reason I recommend the 7X instead of this model is that the top flap on this opens towards you. The 7X opens away from you, so the lid isn't in the way of getting in the main compartment."
2,Waste of my time,"This was a very subjective take on the way people in different cultures have viewed the mother of Jesus. It is written from the author's theological view of the topic, so do not expect a warm, fuzzy devotional read. I think I have only thrown away two books in my life, and this was one of the two. Honestly, I did not even finish reading it. The author, though well respected by some other readers and theologians that I know, was not able to gain my confidence. Two stars is a generous rating. There may be something here for those who want to pick through the chapters to find his sources to use for other research."
4,"Jimmy's Life, Jimmy's Records","Having read the book, I begin to wonder who exactly is collecting on Jimmy's late earned fame. The Amazon has 9 records for sale and yet the man himself barely made ends meet all his life. Read the book, and wonder for yourself ..."
5,David Ritz book,We are fans of Mr. Ritz and have read almost all his biographies. This is a beautifully told story of an artist whose life's struggles are transformed into exquisite music coming from his soul.
5,Interesting to read...,"Enjoyed reading this book. It does capture aspects of the Cebu and the Philippines which are very true. Having grown up in Cebu; and lived in Los Angeles for quite some time now, this book showed the big contrasts that exists. The book has a section describing the Road to Toledo; having taken that road in the 1960's, it brought back memories of how dangerous the road is. Loved the book. I highly recommend it."
5,A Perfect One-Man Boat,"Peter Bacho beautifully articulates the emotional worlds of the deterritorialized Filipino American. With Fr. Ben Lucero's spiritual reconstruction, Bacho constantly explores and mediates between the warm comforts and cold mysteries of Philippine culture. In doing so, Bacho provides an intimate look into the distant, brash, and passionate demeanor of the Filipino psyche... If you believe 'home' stretches across the Pacific, then Cebu is a must-read."
1,CHEAP MATERIALS,UGLY WATCH IN REALITY....IT EVEN HAD A MINOR SCRATCH ON IT....AND THE COLOR OF ITS RUBBER PART WAS LIKE USED......BAD CHOICE
1,Dis....A.....Pointing,"You may like it but it wasn't for me. I wanted to know more about the inside game information and it's players. Good book if all you wanted to know about was Jerry and understand all the Jewish slang (which is provided in the back of the book if you want to keep flipping back and forth 50 times). Like I said, may be a good book for you but not if you're looking for things you've always wandered about that you thought you wouldn't ever know. Earl Strom's book would do that for you. This is more ""all about Jerry"" which....it is a memoir but I got terribly bored with him tooting his own horn so often in this book."
2,Referee memories,"The ref could have put in more interesting stories. I did watch him referee many National football games and thought he did a good job. But the book was boring! He could have gotten a better ghost writer to liven it up. He really is not a very interesting person. Not worth the price I paid. Earl Strom, a former NBA ref who passed away years ago had a book that was twice as good as this one."
1,This book reveals Rushdoony as a dangerous psychotic,He is in the same moral space as Osama bin Laden--religious fundamentalism justifying any sin. If you are looking for a primer on hypocrisy buy this book.
3,Great book!,"I really liked this book.. I agree with a lot of it. I just thought it was funny how the author is so adamant about sticking to the law... Yet the Sabbath was no big deal. LOL! That really made me value the book less, hence the 3 stars. He obviously has a lot of knowledge.. But he's not perfect (no one is). If you understand that, then you can get a lot out of this book. It's interesting, and has a lot of additional resources and information in it.. So I gave it 3 stars.. It would be 5 stars if he wasn't being such a hypocrite about the Sabbath... But that's just my personal opinion, and we all have those."
5,TRUE LAW HAS A STANDARD - GOD'S STANDARD,"The founding fathers of the United States created a Republic under God based on its Declaration of Independance's ""...law of Nature's and Nature's God."" And any violation of this Law of Nature and Nature's God by any government it was deemed a right and a burden for the general people to change or dismantle that power being seen as corrupt - against God and thus against the people.The earnest question today is what is this ""Law of Nature and Nature God."" Blackstones ""Commentary on the Law,"" tells us 'natures law' is seen in creation and 'nature's God' is revealed law i.e. the Bible. Once we come to see the foundation of our Repubic as biblical then the 'Institutes of Biblical Law' becomes an important resource for us and our nation. Only if our Nation is willing to draw upon the revealed law and its commandments can we live true to our birth right ie. Declaration of Independance (yet understood by all our founding fathers as Independance from tyranny)."
2,Engaging...but....,"Rushdoony actually believes in what he's preaching, and that's commendable. However, he is in an overwhelmingly small minority of rabid fundamentalist theocrats. Thankfully (atleast I hope so) 99% of the American people still believe in DEMOCRACY and not THEOCRACY!Also, there has always been this question: How could any TRUE Christian, not want a theocracy based on their believes?"
1,Needs to be read,"If you've ever wondered what the American equivalent of an Islamic fundamentalist state would look like, this is the book to read. It demonstrates how fundamentalism always ends up looking the same, whether its label is Islam, Christian, or Marxist. Pray that these people never take control."
1,Disgusting.....,"I've never read a book more filled with horrific religiously intolerant tripe in my life. I'm not a Christian, and have NO desire to be, but I am very interested in religions of all kinds, which is why I read this book. I found it to be wholly disgusting, for lack of a better word. I only rated it 1 star because the system wouldn't let me rate it none."
1,Malter Made Me Buy This Book,"I have a vast knowledge of the Middle East fiasco and I am always seeking books that may provide me with yet a bit more data. I was not convinced to buy this book by those who wrote positively about it, but rather because I read the numerous inaccuracies by Jill Malter, which is the typical diatribe and deliberate misleading hype that pro-israel propagandists employ to dissuade others from knowing the truth about ongoing israeli land thefts, state-sanctioned torture, destruction of homes, and bonafide war crimes and crimes against humanity. My immediate feeling was that if Malter did not want me to buy this book then it must contain information that I will value."
1,Innaccurate Information Mixed with Bits of Truth,"100 Myths about the Middle East by Fred Halliday is a complete disappointment. It is clear early on that the information in this book is not accurate and that the author has bias. The distortions of the truth are so pervasive throughout that it would take a book to refute the garbage in Halliday's book.Much of what is written is filled with bits of truth but mostly inaccurate information that is wordsmithed into 30 second sound bites of disinformation. It seems that Halliday has not ventured out of his classroom much and is stuck in the theoretical world of the London School of Economics. His understanding of Islam and the Muslim culture is limited. His responses to many of the myths are so short that there is no way complete information can be provided. Hence the sound bites that have some truth to at least attempt a defense of accurate information. Mostly, this is not the case.Skip this book."
2,Too Short and Miss-information,"Mr Halliday states that in 89 Islam does not forbid the consumption of alcohol and for examples he give name of writers and poets who enjoyed their drink, and early verses that did not prohibit alcohol consumption. The reality, the alcohol prohibition was gradual in Islam. First it was permitted than it was prohibited while going to pray. Finally, it was prohibited. The Quran states that alcohol and gambling evil vices that should be avoided.If Ms. Halliday cannot this point accurately which is common knowledge, I cannot assume that anything that he says is accurate"
2,"Great title, shame about the content","I expected to learn a lot from this book. Sadly, it is written by an economist and the book is frequently... economical with the truth.Halliday's myth 27 is that ""The US, backed by the UK, invaded and occupied Iraq in 2003 to gain control of Iraqi oil.""The author proceeds to 'debunk' this 'myth' by reasoning that if oil is what Washington wanted it could simply have struck a deal with Saddam Hussein. Thankfully since then, some polititians have been a bit more honest. George Bush recently confessed that the US is 'addicted to oil' and few will have missed Bremner & Co's post invasion haste to privatise Iraq's national assets (ie. Iraq's oil industry).The West's violent addiction to cheap Middle Eastern oil clearly is NO MYTH. So Halliday's decision to gloss over this with 100 words begs the question - how far is the author's intention to reveal the truth about the Middle East and how far to conceal the truth about us?Great title. Shame about the content."
5,chaney & browning steal the show,"This was one of Chaney's best films largely because of the strong direction of Tod Browning (the sound remake is very weak by comparison). Had hoped Warners Archive would open the cuts but, alas, the cut footage is still cut. However, better to have this cut and with a fine transfer than not at all. Let's hope Warner Archives brings us more of Browning & Chaney - as well as more Chaney.On this DVD, the soundtrack isn't bad unlike the unlistenable trash on their release of ""Mr. Wu"" which ruins an otherwise fine film. Somebody at Warners should show taste when adding soundtracks to silents, most of which had scores composed for them and should still be in the studio archives. A little work that wouldn't eat into the profits."
4,Almost perfect ...,"Very fine sampling of Morricone's work. Would have appreciated a little more from ""Once Upon a Time in America"" which I consider his best work. A very good value if you're a fan."
5,very pleased,I purchased this item through a third party on Amazon. It is original Ennio Morricone versus an imitation. I paid $10 total including shipping. This is good quality film music that has a complexity that leaves my reeling.
5,Amazon verified product,Cd was received in perfect condition and ahead of scheduled delivery. I am very pleased. The music was what it was expected
2,Big Mistake,"I had heard about 6 songs that this artistic had done which were very nice, so I thot this 2 cd would be 'as good' as those songs I had previously heard.I can not tell you how irritating, IRRITATING.......this cd was. The most bizare sounds, not pleasant to the hearing ear at all. I almost threw it out!....and may yet because it was not what I would call 'easy listening'.........irritating is all that comes to mind. So if any one wants it.......its yours!"
3,SOME GEMS AND SOME DUDS,"There are some early stories here that are very well done and well worth reading, but his latter stories, many a single page, written after 1952, are for the most part more like puns. Not my cup of tea and nothing like O'Henry as some have suggested. O'Henry was the master of the tale with the twist. These are just gags and don't tell a tale at all.Special note: One story that stands out among the rest is The Little Lamb. This story is written so well, with such spare and powerful prose that it's out of place here. It's every bit as good as Chandler or Hemingway. Little Lamb proves Brown had the chops to write much better stories than those he sold. But a writer must sell stories and he wrote down to the level of the market. Too bad. No wonder he was cynical."
1,The writing is very poor...Christine Feehan fans will be disappointed,"I tried Book 1...it was slow and relatively poorly written, but had read that it was a good ""recommendation"" for fans of Christine Feehan, Sharolyn Kenyan, Anne Bishop. Sadly, book 2, Heart Thief, was slower, more poorly written. I'm sorry, but is Robin 14? There is so much redundancy in the writing. I doubt her readers are stupid, though I felt insulted, and disgusted more often than not. It was a painful read."
5,the best new author for futuristic romances around today!,"I have just finished reading Heart Thief, I ordered it as soon as I read Heartmate, and I can't wait for her next book! She writes very well, incredibly witty and keep you turning the pages in thrall of what is happening! Her love seens make your heart throb! Great humor too. I recommend her highly and I hardly ever recommend books. A must read and a keeper for your library!"
4,ANOTHER GOOD ONE,Really loved this one. Not my favorite of the series but a close 2nd. Ruis and Alimm ended up ss a perfect couple and looking forward to seeing them jn future books.
3,Celta book series,I bought all 4 books at once. I was disappointed in this series because I didn't feel the characters were mature enough.
5,My 1st of the series,"Loved it. After I had finished, I started looking up all the books in the series. I have read them all now. This remains one of, if not, my favorite(s)."
3,"More like 3.5 stars, but not as high as 4.","As is the case so many times, I have mixed emotions about rating this book. I love the genre and would like to see even more of this type published. However, I did not enjoy this book as much as its prequel, HEARTMATE. I do not intend to discourage readers from reading it; indeed, it is nice to return to the world created in the prequel. I just wish I could give it 4 or 5 stars. Others may disagree."
3,nice but has a certain fanfic flavor,"It begins as a wonderful book but soon starts swinging between a dark, intense futuristic and an oh-so-cute fanfic. The smashed together words LikeThat are really annoying and unimaginative. The book cannot decide what it wants to be and ends up not fulfilling any of the promises it gave."
4,good tool,"It takes a little fiddling to adjust the double blades so that the follower takes just a tiny bit more wood than the front one does. Once adjusted it works as advertised - it puts a reasonably smooth edge on your wood. Does not work as well on end grain, but that would be expected of any power or hand tool.I use it to quickly ""break the edge"" of things like shelves, boxes, etc.I have used a router with a comparable size rounding bit (1/16 I think) and must say that this plane leaves an edge that is about as good as the router, without the time and hassle of changing bits, adjusting fences, etc.Whichever method I use, I follow up with a quick, light sanding, but that's mostly because I'm fussy.Considering the price of this tool is less than a router bit, I think it's well worth the cost."
4,It's all in the Adjustment,"If you take the time to adjust this correctly and do not try to remove too much wood at a time, this radius plane works fine. If you buy the chamfer blades (sold separately, of course) plan on taking a few extra minutes with the alignment of the blades. You might consider purchasing a second plane and a set of chamfer blades and have one plane dedicated to radius and one for chamfer of each.This will not replace your router. It will provide you with a tool to quickly break an edge or again, if you take your time and take little bites, it will give you consistent quality results over a longer length."
2,slick plane,"When it was made in the USA it was a really good device, however the blade adjustment system is poorly designed and the blade placement is poorly designed."
4,Good alternative to the router.,"I agree and reiterate with what has already been said.*It will not replace your router.*Adjust, adjust, adjust for the wood you are planing.*Hone the blades before the first use.*Buy two...one for each blade type.*Take your time.One of my favorite tools in the shop."
2,Rough,"The brush is too rough and left scratch marks on my skin. Maybe my skin is too thin. This is probably a product you need to test out in person. However, after I used it one time, your skin does tingle. So it does work."
5,"Nice product, easy to use","The first monitor didnt work, but returning it was very easy. I got a new one within a few days. My mother who is 85 and not technically savy is able to use this without a problem. It comes with a nice storage case and batteries."
1,Watch out!,"The magazine does have good information, but not for a child...it's more geared to an adult. Watch out though! They like to send you notices of collection if you do not renew the magazine when your subscription is up."
1,SCAM ALERT - SCAM ALERT - SCAM ALERT - SCAM ALERT,"I also got this disgusting subscription ""invoice"" from these jerks. I don't care HOW GOOD A MAGAZINE IS, if someone has to use deceptive, threatening and totally bogus marketing practices to ensnare new subscriptions, their magazine should not be rewarded with anyone's business. I never ordered or got a single issue of their rag. Only a repeating smack in the face via mailbox claiming I am going to be ""referred to a collection agency."" KIDS Discover, you will NEVER get a cent out of me. Last time I checked we still live in a land where we don't have to pay for what we never got. If you spent as much time working on a good magazine for kids as you do sending out fake bills, you would have enough subscribers you wouldn't have to Shanghai any new ones with your fraudulent billing scam."
2,Grandaughter not happy w/ Kids Discover,"Subscribed to Kids Discover, Ranger Rick and Highlights for three different grandchildren, ages 12, 10 and 8. The other two arrived quickly in time for gift and children and parents are delighted. Each issue arrives timely. BUT Kids Discover took about 3 months to even arrive and then was sporadic all year. My grandaughter isn't a complainer but her mother said she waits for her next issue and it doesn't come or comes late. She has received only about 9 when it should be 12. Might not matter as much if the other kids weren't getting theirs every month."
3,Great product - lousy service,"My nephew loves the mag. But the clowns at amazon made it torture to reorder. None of the web links were working, on either of my computers or from my iPhone. MANY calls to Customer ""service."" Guess what? Not a single one of the agents are able to take an order by phone; they refer you back to the web page (which wasn't working for my account.....).After 5 (!!!!!!) weeks of attempts to order, amazon reset something and I completed my order- too late for my nephew's birthday.Thanks not, amazon."
1,Count me in as another receiving nasty subscription notices,"We had a subscription to this magazine and it's a pretty good one for the kids, albeit woefully thin. I found it too expensive for the few pages the magazine has and did not renew it. After ignoring the standard renewal pleas, yesterday I found in my mailbox a letter (with subscription invoice attached, of course) stating that my account was ""seriously past due"" and that ""further action is pending"" on my ""delinquent"" account. For those getting similar notices, I found this number to call:1-800-825-2821The lady I spoke with said she cancelled the 'unathorized order'...we shall see if I receive any other notices.It really is a shame that the tactics of the subscription services overshadow the actual product."
1,Fraudulent Billing,"We've never received this magazine, but we just received the bill with a message that we are about to be turned over to a collection agency.BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY"
1,Major Disappointment!,"My 8 yr. old son waited and waited for his first subscription. What a disappointment when it finally arrived. I thought it was a brochure and almost threw it out. It is only 7 pages long. My daughters received subscriptions to American Girl and Discovery Girls and he was expecting his magazine to be comparable, but about Science subjects. On top of that they are telling me that his subscription is up in October when he only received his first one in February. I feel like we have been scammed. >:("
1,Beware of Bogus Billing from Kids Discover,I just received a first-time correspondence from Kids Discover threatening referral to a credit agency for copies of a magazine that we didn't order and haven't received. There is no telephone number to call and only a p.o. box to correspond with. I suspect many people just pay the bill in order to avoid any trouble. I sent a notice to the Consomer Complaint agency in the states involved in order to get this fraud on record.
5,Excellence for Children,"This is an excellent resource for children who are interested in learning in depth about one subject. Each issue has lovely photographs that enhance the text. There are pictures, drawings, graphs and more - all covering the same subject. My son who is 9 completely enjoys this magazine and shares with me a lot of what he has learned when reading it.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
5,"Rise, Let Us Be On Our Way","This book captured my spirit. I felt the Pope becoming my very own father and arousing my youthful spirit. I felt for the humiliation the Church and the people in Poland experienced during those years of Hitler's invasion and Communism.John Paul II speaks of his interests, circumstances, the courage of others that influenced him, and God's words confirming him and leading him onward.All his life journey, like ours, is in the hands of God no matter what prevails.I was impressed, but not surprised to understand how prayerful and dedicated John Paul II was to the spiritual life, (of Christ)connecting to others, the circumstances he had before him, and rising up to meet them with acceptance.The book is for all; no matter you are a bishop, a student, or a ""nobody"". We are all the same to God."
5,A great book,"I am certainly not religious...although I found this book to be insightful and interesting...also, I am shocked at the childishness of some people who are reviewing here...reminds me that there really are people out there that trully need to get a life, if you don''t like the pope then fine but to go out of your way to post childish reviews is beyond pathetic its just sad.Beyond that....as I said before as a non-religious person I found this to be an inspirational and interesting read."
5,I LOVE WILDFIRE!!!!!,"This was a great seaason. Waiting on season 4. CAN""T WAIT ANY LONGER!!!!!!! HURRY ABC FAMILY AND PUT OUT SEASON 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WANT/NEED IT!!!!!!"
5,Wildfire S03: DVD,"This DVD season is a great one if you already know about the adventures from the other two seasons. It is full of laughter, drama and romance. All in all, great season and show overall. The series ends phenomenally, making it one of my top series to watch. This isnt a series someone should jump into midship though because it will be difficult to follow the plot. Worth a buy!"
5,Amazing!,"This is one of the best seasons, although I wish they could release the 4th and final season on DVD already! The 4th is the one I love."
5,Wildfire Series,"Wildfire Series...A heartwarming story of a girl that had strayed from the straight and narrow, taken in by a racing family.The trials and tribulations that a young girl like this must endure, due to the deviousness of others, and it seems to never end.The cliff hangers at the end are brutal, hope there is a Series Four available...Del Dennis"
4,Love this season....,"I like this season even though that Kris had hooked up with Matt not Junior :( however I liked it because it's got character, pain, betrayal, and all that."
3,decent stuff but way overpriced here!,do a quick google search and you can find it for less than half of what it is being sold for here.
4,this is a very good Portable DVD Player,I had this unit as a gift from my brother. Its been over a year now and had no problem with it what so ever. I use it almost everyday specially when i'm in bed and it is working just fine even with my back-up movies and my mp3 CDs. the battary can almost playes two movies or a one three hours movie when its fully charged. I even dropped it coupl times thnking there is no way its gonna work again but it suprised me. the down side of it is the sound quality comming from the built-in speakers which is a common thing in all Portable DVD players and for some reason the bottom of the player heats up and gets warm. I dont know if the same thing happens in all Portable DVD players or not. otherwise this is a good unit to invest your money in.
2,Still Loading,"My daughter received this DVD player Christmas 2005. It seemed to work just fine for a few months. Then, one day it just seemed to be in an eternal ""Loading"" position. I bought a name brand DVD lens cleaner to see if that would rectify the problem. It did not. Thus, it is ""loading""."
1,Wouldn't recommend it.,"Purchased back in May 2005. Worked great for a few trips, even went overseas with it, then put it away for a few months. Going on another trip, took the player out, and when I insert a disc, it just spins and spins and spins, displaying ""Loading disc"" on the display. It never gets past this step.I would definitely recommend anyone looking at this product to stay away."
1,After 3 months - battery degrades and is unusable,"This phone started out fine in August when the phone was first purchased. The phone would last a good couple hours off the cradle in an idle mode. However, now a single 5-10 minute phone call , after charging overnight, will inexplicably kill the phone, and the call, leading to an unusable product. Panasonic support wishes to charge me money to have the unit looked at - which I refuse to do , given I think the product should work correctly. Based upon other peoples feedback and experiences - I think this series of phones from Panasonic(2237/2247/2257) have a design issue that needs to be addressed - or better yet Recalled. Do not purchase this phone."
2,will not hold charge,"This phone has some greate features. The only problem is that you cannot make use of them if the phone does not work. This phone will not hold charge. I leave it in the charger all night, make one 15 minute call and then it either just dies or the battery shows that there is no charge left, and this is with a new battery. The other thing that I noticed while troubleshoting is that if you remove a fully charged battery, and then place it back in to the phone... it shows as almost completely empty.... like I said it would be a great phone, but there is something very wrong with this design."
1,Only if I read the review first...,"~I bought this phone when it just came on the market and there was no reviews available back then. I bought it becuase it was a good looking unit and it was Panasonic. I have had it for a year. I have to say..all the negative reviews about the ring, the battery and the charge are 100% true. I experienced them all plus many others... I just put mine back to the charger. I was so fed-up with it and decided to write this reiview (something I've wanted to do for a long time). If you are thinking~~ of buying this phone, please reconsider..unless the apperance is your most important consideration. It IS a sleek looking phone.~"
2,Horrible sound quality,"I have always like Panasonic phones - some of the best battery life and sound quality I have ever had. This one was different. It has some of the worst sound quality I have ever heard. No problem with battery life, just very annoying sound quality."
2,Thank you Jon Scott!!,"After dealing with panasonic for over a year regarding the short battery life (1 hour at most) I have finally gotten somewhere thanks to Jon's review. I wrote to panasonic after my friend returned her phone to them and it was repaired. I asked them if knew they about the problem with this phone, why weren't they letting people know? They refused to provide any help and said if I was still in warrantly I could return it. Otherwise, I was out of luck. Panasonic was certainly aware of the problem with this phone, but clearly refused to publicly accept responsiblity or issue a recall. Thankfully, with a post it note, I have been able to solve the battery problem that has been plaguing me since I purchased this phone. If you own this phone, try Jon's suggestion it works!"
3,You get what you pay for,"Having been satisfied with Grizzly machinery & tools in the past, I took a chance on this inexpensive jig. First, the ganged holes on one end are not drilled parallel to each other. Second, holes are not bored squarely to the face. Third, the clamping action is so sloppy that it can't center itself perfectly every time.I could go on, but you get the point. This is a less expensive copy of a much better jig on the market. I shimmed mine with masking tape until it is useful. Still, I must shake my head and laugh at myself for buying this."
5,Great for heavy duty woodworking,This jig is extremely easy to use and very accurate. I use it to align thick slabs of oak for benches and tables and alternate dowels and biscuits for a strong joint. It helps align long planks and makes joints easier to make while minimizing sanding.
1,It is a sloppy fit,I could have bought the same thing at Harbor Fright for half the cost and I would not have been as disapointed. I screwed around with this jig for two hours till I finely figured out that I had to shim the top of this jig to get it to drill a stright hole into the wood. Not worth the money.
3,Decent Jig,"This is the first doweling jig I've ever bought and find it to be decent...only decent. It's very easy to use and appears to be pretty solid. Most of the time the holes I drill are centered, but for some reason (that I have yet to explain) maybe 20% of the holes are noticeably off-center. I wipe the jig after each use and make sure it is sitting flush against the wood before drilling, even so, the holes are not always centered.The other complaint I have about this jig is that the lines that are cast into the metal so you can line up your mark to the jig are very poorly made. The cast lines are painted white to make them easier to see on the metal, but the paint is not straight and that makes lining things up a bit tricky and frankly annoying.With that said, I will keep using the jig and find it acceptable for the price. If you have the means though, I highly recommend you look for something better."
3,Cheap knockoff of the Task Pro,"This is a cheap Chinese knockoff of the USA-made Task Pro Center self-centering doweling jig (Self-centering Doweling Jig with 6 Hardened Drill Bushings). Spend the extra couple of bucks for the real one, and get a tool that will last a lifetime, or save a few bucks on this sweatshop-produced version. See also the larger 6-inch version:6"" Self-centering Doweling Jig - Task Pro Center Line"
2,"Biblical Hebrew Step by Step, Volume 2: Readings from the Book of...",The Hebrew texts are very hard to read. They appear to be images taken from another source and compressed rather than original text created for the book. The glossary is not complete. Lots of words used in the lessons are not in the glossary and the definitions and explanations in the text are organized by occurrence in the text. These two things make it very hard to look up definitions and explanations of usage and translations.
2,still leaks,after putting in a quart and a half- still leaks- only red instead of yellow colored oil. If you were thinking you probably need new seals- you probably do- this is not a rescue.
4,Great Remix CD,"The cover of this CD looks like the Australian CD version of this song. The remix CD in itself is very good and the fact that Pink is one of my favorite singers helps me to enjoy it even more. You Make Me Sick is one of her songs that has been less popular than her other releases primarily b/c when it was released the CD was burnin out and it wasn't a good time to release it. Though it did do well in the beginning of 2001 enterin the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The 3 remixes on this Cd are off da hook with the first havin the same vocals as the original but a different and unique beat. Shoot, this could've been released as the single. The 2nd and 3rd songs which are remixes [are good] certainly. They are almost better than the MOST GIRLS remixes. There is an Instrumental which is good to hear the beat by itslef and sing along. And then finally there is the regular version of the song which everyone should kno. Overall, this is a pretty good remix CD."
2,NOT real Star Wars movie,This set has three discs. Only one disc has little to do with Star Wars. It's the interview with George Lucas on how the movie was made. The other two discs are not related at all.
4,Slightly lower K than I would have expected but good,"Hey, Amazon Prime on lightbulbs. I have arrived in the 21st century. Anyway, these are great but the light they produce is a little yellower than the other bulbs. They market them as applicable with 130v, so maybe they're designed for a different country or something."
5,Morrissey at his best,"I bought this CD four years ago and it's still one of most prized possessions. The recording captures Morrissey's charisma, energy, and ability to relate to his audience. All of the songs are great and most are better than the studio versions. Those who heard these performances live are very fortunate. Luckily they were recorded for the rest of us."
4,Swingin' honky tonk and usual psychedelic Plantation/SSS weirdness from OMNI...,"This has the usual dose of weird '60s country found on other OMNI releases. In this case, however, both the psychedelic and more straight ahead country are a cut above, sometimes bordering on downright awesome. If you've ever enjoyed anything released by OMNI or Shelby Singleton, seek this one out. It's currently out of print but worth the hunt."
5,Stuart is great!,"I don't know a lot about screenwriting but always wanted to try writing a movie, so I got a couple of these Dialogue DVDs. I watched the Stuart Beattie one first, and I didn't know what to expect. There's lots of names and lingo, but they do a good job of explaining everything with captions that look like dictionary entries. I really liked Stuart (maybe it was his Australian accent), and by the time I finished hearing all his stories, I felt like I learned a lot about what it's really like to be a writer in Hollywood."
3,A Lot of Instrumentals,"On one hand, you do get a lot of tracks. For rock 'n roll complestists - especially fans of early 1960's British rock 'n roll, it's nicely priced and you get lots of tracks - nice fidelity and presumably a lot of obscure artists and tracks you'd be hard press to round up otherwise.As an American, it's merely okay and not particularly exciting. It doesn't stand up to the really rockin' instrumentals of the late 1950's or a more apt comparison, the surf sounds of Dick Dale, the Sufaris and dozens others - it just doesn't compare. It's pleasant and professional but it's not the full attack of the ax like Dick Dale, the Trashmen or even the Ventures ... it's just pleasant.So, it's not bad but it's not great."
4,Great Family Flick,"My daughter and I used to love this movie when it played on cable. It is a silly and fun family movie. If you're looking for a serious movie, keep looking. Entertaining if you're looking for a humorous kids' movie that a mom can enjoy too.Hope they make a DVD, because I won't spend more than two dollars on VHS tapes; the quality is just not worth these high prices for VHS."
4,Have your kids watch this if they think they wanna trade parents.,Watched this when I was younger and had my son watch it the other day. It changed his attitude quickly.
4,A Sleeper for the Kids,"Predictable, yes... even from the title. Nevertheless, this delightful little morality tale for kids is worth the time. Anna and her siblings turn in credible performances and Sissy Spacek is a delight as all four moms. Don't let the professional critics fool you into thinking that this isn't worth the time of day... it is for anyone with an eye toward fantasy without a lot of FX."
3,Nothing Special,"Though there are portions that are humorous and heart-warming, this movie is, over-all, rather bland. In the first thirty minutes, the viewer knows the ending, which can be guessed in the first five. ""Trading Mom"" is another movie that attempts to teach viewers to appreciate what they have, but ends up being predictable and ho-humm."
2,keep looking,"not much here beside Sissy Spacek (where has she been?) mugging in four different roles. ok if it's on tv, but not worth the money or effort to rent/own"
3,volcano waves from Italy are subtle...,"electronic music made by two guys from Pompei, Italy...hmm..interesting already. You may expect this to be very sparse and minimal, but once you listen you will discover the sounds to be thick and organic. It's pop music already. Pop music on the Roland sampler. Some of the tracks are ready for the dance floor- warm, human, dancing. For fans of other eclectic electronic Hefty acts (i.e., Mondii and savath and savalas). Good stuff."
3,Beware special chain size,"I agree with the review from the Alaska guy. The Husqvarna model 142 ($199) is a great saw with a lot of power and is easy to start. Perfect for a home owner that only uses it occasionally. My problem is with finding a replacement chain. Finding a replacement chain has been so much of a problem that I have dropped the rating two full stars. Lowes and Northern Supply both sell the model 142, but neither carries a replacement chain, and none of the other stores I contacted carry it. It is a very light chain, only .043"" gauge. The light chain is not a problem, it cuts great. I finally replaced the original bar and chain with a new Husqvarne 16"" bar that accepts a standard 91VG56 chain (.050"" gauge)."
4,Good saw - crappy chain,"Hey all - I have to agree with the good reviews on this - it's a very good saw, and runs great. The problem I am having -- the stupid chain is too small and I can't find a replacement chain. I will probably end up changing out the bar and the chain fora .050 one, as I can't find a replacement and some contractors bent one of the inside teeth and it won't stay on the bar anymore... That's why it's 4 and not 5 stars."
4,Terrific Film!,"I've been a fan of Bollywood films for almost eight years now and I can say that most of them, perhaps 98% of these films are not great due to actors who are way overrated and simply cannot act, stories that go on forever, childish dialogue, over the top melodramatic scenes, and so on. But they sure are entertaining. Even though I find Shahrukh Khan to be a mediocre actor, he does a great job of entertaining in this film. He takes on two different personalities and expertly portrays the dimensions of the characters. The music is fantastic. Do yourself a big favor and buy this DVD when it becomes available."
3,video quality review,"This is a great movie, I'm a SRK fan so I found it entertaining and funny. I had one hugh problem however, I did not get to enjoy the movie as much because the picture quality was extremely poor. Not to worry I reported this to Amazon and they offer to send me a new copy providing I return the bad one. Not bad huh?"
5,My Favorite Film!!!!!!!!,"This is the second film I ever saw with Shah Rukh Khan. (Veer-Zaara was the first & I love that one.) The love story was especially touching! I was very impressed with Shah Rukh Khan's diversity in depicting both Surinder Sahni and Raj. I loved being drawn into the sights and sounds of India and getting a glimpse of the culture and traditions of India. I love the music, dancing, and the moments of religeous devotion shown in the film. I also love the humor in the film. The final dance number was incredibly powerful. This is my favorite film!"
5,Shah Rukh Khan!!!! is awesome,"This is one of Shah Rukh Khan's best roles. The story is simple yet complicated at times. The story is about a nerdy Indian man who can't seem to express his emotions to his wife. Then comes his alter ego Raj who displays his affections very well! now which one will the wife choose? that's where you just cry! this is a funny, emotional, loving story that you can't miss. SRK is the best actor on earth!"
4,Decent love story,"Yash Raj films has churned another romantic film; this time with Aditya Chopra. It's a decent one time watch with some nice moments. I love the part where Anushka and SRK were on the bike immitating Dhoom. I felt some of the scenes were too melodramatic, especially towards the climax. Songs were good, especially Dance Pe Chance. A good watch with family!"
4,A great book about some great women in a great environment!,This is a well written book about fascinating women. I know many of the women Leslie writes about and all are perfectly illustrated by the rich text within the book. Good job!
4,Fascinating look at the lives of women working in Alaska.,This book made the struggles and accomplishments of Alaska's fishing women a great read! I felt like I got to know these women as friends.
3,Focuses Too Much on Middle Class Women,"This book, while well written by a worthy author, focuses too much on the experiences of middle class women to the neglect of the experiences of Alaskan Native and local working class people. Thus we have the complaints of at least one individual that, based on my own personal experiences with this person, are entirely exaggerated and reflect incredible narcissism, snobbery and lack of consideration for other people. It was exactly this mentality, masquerading as politically correct feminism, that caused the director of the nursing program at the Univeristy of Alaska to be fired during this period."
3,If they thought it was going to be easy they shouldn't go!,This is a hard job for anyone. Why do these women whine about how difficult the situations were (are).
5,"Powerful, Unique and Loud","I love this CD and would recommend it highly. A rich tapestry of different instruments is woven...throw in lyrics with actual depth, gruff voices reminiscent to me of nomads, and a high, sweet female voice and you've got a piece that speaks to you on multi levels. I do not claim to be a music expert, but I find the whole CD successful. Christian music has taken an exciting and complex twist with this one."
1,Outdated information,"The information contained in the book is outdated and could be hazardous to your hamster. ""White shaving"" aka pine shavings are a no-no due to potential respiratory problems. The wire wheel, is also a no-no. Every year, many hamsters are seriously injured by wire wheels. There are better, much more up to date books that give safer information than this book!"
2,Great fun until it broke,"We have gone through two of these toys in two days. The propeller stopped spinning on the first one after maybe a dozen launches. We took it back to the store and they let us exchange it for a new one. The second one ended up with a broken propeller after less than 5 launches. Unless you have a huge, empty field, don't bother with this toy as it is not durable enough to stand up to crashing into houses, trees, fences, etc."
2,Lasted one day,I really like this toy but it only lasted a day before the prop would no longer turn. Very sad really. Will look for a different design.
4,Recommended,"Very pastorally informed and Bible based book. Assumes too much that the women are the victims and men the scoundrels, but if you can make the needed mental adjustments, it's an insightful, though perhaps hastily written, book."
5,"Inspirational, Encouraging Reading","This book is composed of inspirational and encouraging sermons from men and women. The chapters are practical and easy to read. The chapters include prayers, scripture, and good, sound, Biblical advice.Dr. Jeanne L. Porter's ""Breaking Free from the Waiting to Exhale Syndrome"" in Chapter 7 will offer a liberating and uplifting message to single and married women. The last chapter ""Jesus Made the Difference"" by Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. will help the reader who is wrestling with demons like doubt, lust,addiction, and low self-esteem.This is a great book to buy for yourself, family members, or friends. Everyone will find something in this book to encourage them."
1,Never got it,I never recived my conair product. I was tracking and then it said it was being returned to sender. So I had Amazon resend it once it got back to them. then they shipped it again. Then once again i was tracking it and it said Returning to sender so i never got my conair product. And i am waiting for my refund once it reaches Amozon again.
1,disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book as the description of her experience with the ""Mormon"" church was so inaccurate that I wouldn't have known what religion she was talking about had she not specified the name. I have been a member of the church my whole life and have NEVER EVER seen anything like what she is talking about. There is a re-organized Mormon Church and I am not sure if that was the group that she was involved with but The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is not at all like what I was reading. No matter what religious faith that you belong to I would hope that you would look past the information in this book and find out for yourself what the LDS church really teaches. Anyone who has a deep faith would be upset at having that faith depicted in the way this book presents The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I would not recommend this book and am sorry that I bought it."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"I can't imagine any intelligent person getting ANYTHING helpful from the material presented in this video. While Mr. Fraser seems to have a following, he simply doesn't present the information in a step-by-step, rational, scientifically informed approach. This man is a charlatan. For something useful and worth your time/money, consider buy Barbara Lister-Sink's ""Freeing the Caged Bird."""
2,Ok mysery,"Knight s Don't Teach Piano by Debbie Dadey is an exciting mystery told in third person. One of the main characters is Eddie who is rude, obnoxious and mean. Another main character is Howie who is nice and smart. They live in Baley City during modern times. The people think that knights are going to take over the city. Eddie got piano lesson for his birthday. A knight gives Eddie the piano. The boys explore the knight house and find a round table and a white horse. Then they saw the knight jousting. Then the knight said I will take over Baley City.I would not recommend this book to anyone. It isn't really detailed. The plot was not good. That why I would not recommend this book to anyone. I would rate this book two stars."
4,Another interesting story in this neat series.,"It was a great book. Eddie's grandmother has him take piano lessons from a strange man, Lance E. Lott. The place where he takes piano lessons even looks like a castle complete with a round table. Could Mr. Lott really be a knight in shining armor? The Bailey School Kids are going to find out.I enjoyed this book because it was funny and interesting. This story comes complete with sword fights and jousting matches. Maybe Eddie should have taken flute lessons instead. If you want to find out why you will just have to read the book.Ryan, age 8"
3,"Good in 1985, but outdated now. Here is an alternative.","I am the author. This book was useful in 1985, but is obviously outdated now, due to changes in software and law office automation. Instead, I recommend the following alternate title: ""Microsoft Word 2002 for Law Firms w/CD,"" by Payne Consulting Group Inc. That book is more current, but even so, MS Word changes with every release, so be sure to get the most updated edition of that work, and an appropriate reference for the specific version of MS Word software that you are using. The Payne Consulting book is available here on Amazon.com."
1,Didn't last long,"I bought the camera a few months ago and it was great. It took beautiful pictures at first. Then it started acting up and it thought it needed a battery replacement, which upset me because the battery cost over $ and I thought that it would have lasted longer that a couple of months, I'm not a heavy cammera user..... I bought new batteries and it still won't take pictures. It'll zoom, the display indicated that it's ready and the digital display is lit but it won't take any pictures......I have emailed Jazz corp and am waiting for a reply.....they handle the service for the cameras.........Buyer be ware!!!"
5,Killer!,"Wonderful stuff! I truly think these Chicago boys are the best players I've heard since the Pogues. Don't get me wrong, I dig Flogging Molly, Dropkick Murphys, The Popes, etc., but these guys are more traditional sounding, and they definitely have that attitude. Another plus is the spoken intros/commentaries by some old black guy who sounds like and old time bluesman. These are hilariously funny, it's too bad there aren't more of them on this CD. Anyway, check it out, and remember, MANDOLIN RULES, BABY!!Peace..."
2,Basic thermometer - no frills,Get's the job done but a few things I don't like are the variance in readings along with the fact that switching between F and C isn't very obvious. Right now I've got it stuck in Celsius (somehow?!) and need to read the manual on how to change it back.
1,Horrible product,"Do not waste your money on this themometer. The protective cover is very hard to put on, and after a couple of weeks it quit working completely. According to the themometer my grandkids had a temp of around 92 degrees, or less.......I had to go to the store and buy a new one, which I should have done first!"
3,very good but........................,"when i try my new thermometer it has some memories saved on it...................WTF? i think that this product was new.................the worst thing is that i dont live in the USA, so i cant return it. the only positive is that the thermometer works fine"
1,Does it work?,"Would not turn on. Replaced 2032 battery with one of my own (the original battery was dead). It does work, after a fashion, but I'm not going to rely on it. ""New"" unit had two readings in its memory -- don't know if that was quality control or another person trying it out before Samsung repackaged it -- don't care either. Dead battery should not happen, and leaves me wondering just how long Amazon has had these."
1,Don't buy this product,Same as the other review. The thermometer will not turn on. I won't change the battery because I don't think I should have to pay for it if I bought a brand new product. I will return it and buy a better thermometer.
1,The Doll,"My book is called The Doll,not Yesterdays Doll,but it is the same book.At first it draws you in,but soon it drags and is sooo boring.I can imagine many kids groaning and putting it aside and saying this is boring.Meg has a magical doll that sends her into the past as someone else.Like it said,it gets very dragging."
1,A Dictionary of Opera and Song Themes Revised Edition. . . .,I never received this book. The seller has said he couldn't for some reason and was going to refund my money. That was some ten days ago; so far. . .nothing. I really would like that refund.
5,transported,"This cd eases mind and opens my heart... lingering, haunting melodies and each song so carefully crafted, its own little world... the album covers a whole range of emotions with disarming honesty and sincerity... if you don't own it, you should... this album reminds us of the heights we can reach when people who truly love music are the people who are making it..."
4,Good overall guide to digital photography,"I like the overall layout, discussing various topics relating to digital photography. Have only read 1/2 the book and have already learned a lot, found new things to try, and new ""accessories"" I want/need to buy. :-)As others have noted he does have some errors, some so obvious you wonder how they weren't caught, but then I've found errors in virtually every book I've ever read so I don't fault him too much for that.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to understand more about how digital photography works, how to use their camera, memory, computer, etc. as an entire system to take, edit, store, and print photos."
4,Helpful as far as I've gone.,"This tells you everything about the digital camera. However, I havenot gotten in it too far. It's a bit complicated for me. The f stops and ISO's etc.I will have to go over that part again. Most people know this stuff, but thatis why I bought this book."
2,charley,"There are many techniques in photography that do not change over time & while this book covers many of them for beginers& intermediate users, having been writen over 4 years ago, I would look for a more up to date book."
3,Beginers' Only,Very little details on camera useage to match SLR experience. Very little details in general. I did not find 3/4 of the material to be of value.
2,would like to see a book similat to this for Mac people,"My main disappointment would be all the info concerning storage, editing around the PC/Windows platform As a iMac person this was a total waste."
4,very pleased,"So far I'm finding this book helpful. I've only used point and shoot cameras so far and I just purchased my first DSLR and have no experience with SLRs to begin with. I needed a book that DIDN'T assume previous photography (not snapshot) experience. This is it. I foudn the explanations helpful and am not worried about any technical errors mentioned in the previous reviews. Once I'm ready for more srious picture taking, I'll find other sources to make up for any of the mistakes there may be in this book. All in all I think this is a good beginner basics book that covers quite a bit of material."
4,Gossip Girl rocks!,"Gossip Girl is still at it again. This book is as good as the first one but more realistic. The upper east siders are know applying for colleges. B's mom is getting married; S and D's relationship is getting somewhere, et cetera. I bought this version because I love the TV series and the actors. I hope you'll like it too."
3,Review by Kiri Gelhard,"So I read this book first and didn't read anyother ones, you don't really need to know about what happened in the previous ones. This is the typical highschool drama book. It is spunky because it is in the rich New York City setting and the girls have a lot of attitude. It is also interesting to see how intereted people are in sex at young ages now a days, no one seems to be wanting relationships, the girls are independent. Over all this book is good if you are into gossip and getting a glimpse into the rich life where you can day dream about driving around in rich cars and living in fancy houses. This is a really easy book to read so if someone would want a short easy and entertaining read this would be a good one."
4,They're back....,"This book is just as good as the first, in my opinion.This one mostly focuses on Blair, Nate, and Jenny/Jennifer. Blair wants to finally lose her virginity to Nate, but the thing is Nate has started seeing a younger girl, a freshemn whom he calls Jennifer. Blair has no idea he is seeing someone else! Of course, Blair eventually finds out, and now her mom is marrying her boyfriend who Blair can't stand and he also has a son, Blair's new step-brother Aaron!Blair's life has been so hectic lately that when she goes for her Yale interview she completely blows its! She told them about her family problems, a crime she did, and why her life is so screwed up, and after she kissed her interview, old enough to be her father! Blair's life is no longer so perfect.An improvement to the first book with a better plot. If you read the first in the series and enjoyed it I highly recommend this book!"
3,Gossip isn't the greatest,"There are some people who are writing reviews stating that this is the best or one of the best books they have ever read. It is far from the best, but it is a really enjoyable beach read. It is a fun book to read and an entertaining one..."
5,Good Fun even for guys,Even though I'm a guy I must say I love this book. Being from the Upper East Side myself it's cool to see my friends and I in the characters. The drama never stops and sometimes it's actually funny some of the things the characters do. It's a must read for guys who really wanna know what's going on in a girls' head. And for the record: Girls are just mean to each other. No matter where you live or what school you go to you can relate to GG. So girls enjoy your book and guys learn something!
4,I know I love Gossip Girl!,"I thought Gossip Girl was a witty and clever satire about Upper East Side teens and their ""plights."" You Know You Love Me, the second part of the series, is the continuation of the betrayal, rivalry and poisonous gossip that occurred in the first installment.The gang is preparing for the gruesome period of having to decide which college to apply for. An overachiever with a poor-little-rich-girl complex, Blair wants to be accepted to Yale and is determined to lose her virginity to Nate before the end of senior year. To her chagrin, Nate has other ideas. To make matters worse, her mother decides to get married on Blair's birthday. Will she be able to deal with all the pressure? Unsure about the course of her future, all Serena van der Woodsen wants is to have fun. But will she be forced to wise up when she discovers a young artist's devotion to her? There are some fun twists in this second installment. You Know You Love Me is sheer entertainment. I can't recommend it enough."
1,Junk reading!,"This is what I consider a junk-reading. It's entertaining and that's it, I wouldn't consider any book in this series as a good book. As a matter of fact they all are annoying."
3,"Break up, get back together, break up, rinse, repeat","This one was a little more depressing than the last; the relationships that were healed have fallen apart and Blair especially had some hard times. It's fun to read about their lives and struggles, but as the kind of book I read for brain candy, this one fell a little short."
5,Another great and addicting Gossip Girl novel!,"This great book in the series was so addicting, I literally couldn't put it down. I took it everywhere with me! The lives of our favorite Upper East side teens get even more intense and realtionships really start to get interesting in Gossip Girl #2. These books just bring out the gossiper within us all.Keep reading, I know I can't wait to get my hands on the next one!"
4,Ha!,I think this book and this series is hilarious! Some people will probably think it is catty or trashy but if you just look at the humor you will definitly enjoy it. It's ironic that these people who seem to have everything still have screwed up lives. But I'd recommend this to all teenage girls who are looking for something funny and juicy to read. It's all the fun of gossip with none of the harsh consequences!
4,gossip,At first I didn't like the second as much as the first because alot of the details are recycled from the first. I was like: I already know this! But then something happened. Aaron happened. And he is a breath of fresh air added to the story. And how Blair reacts to her mother remarrying is totally funny and tragic also. Then Nate cheats on her. Wow that subplot was wonderful! I loved it. And I also loved that Serena and Dan DIDNT work out. It really makes sense.
4,FILLS A GREAT NICHE!,"This book filled a great niche in the reading genre. The rich spoiled girls and their college prep schools. But behind their stylish and luxurious lives, is scandal, lies, and deceit. I really enjoyed the overall theme for the book, but I am 17 and so the reading seemed a bit juvenile at times. It would fit the 13-15 year old readers best. But I wish their were some more books like this college-level!"
4,Excellent,You Know You Love Me takes place right after Gossip Girl ends. It was an extremely good book and if any of you out there love shopping like me you'll love this book too. Basically what happens is Blair's mother is getting married to gross Cyrus Rose and we get introduced to Cyrus's son Aaron. Serena is becoming a little weirded out by Dan's over the top feelings and Dan is starting to realize that maybe Serena isn't the one. Jenny's getting involved with cute Nate and Blair seems to be falling out of love with Nate (of course she doesn't realize it until the very end). A great book narrated by an incredibly humorous omniscent character. We travel through college interviews and love and of course... BARNEYS!;)
1,Lame,"I'm shocked. It really worries me that so many girls my age read these books. I don't like to sound like a parent, but these books set a really bad example. The characters are so spoiled, it's disgusting. And they're mean, not to mention slutty. How can this book be a bestseller? It's trash. Don't people get bored with girls acting trashy and sleeping around? Look, read what you want, but parents should be warned about this book. Gossip Girl is a serious waste of your time!!"
3,Hit And Miss...,"Basically a live greatest hits disc but without the original vocalists which surprised me on first listening. The original domestic version contains 3 bonus tracks not found on the import, all of which are quite good. This should have been a 2 disc affair with all the material there is to draw from, but we get only a single disc. The band is top-notch and the sound is good. What is missing is the original vocalists which would have made this disc considerably more essential. Imagine if you will, Eric Woolfson singing 2 of his classics here: Time and Eye In The Sky. Oh what could have been."
4,The Perfect speed demon tube.,I myself just being 14 love this tubeFun- Amazing speeds and hours of funEducational- Only educational value is when you fall down get back up againDurable- It will not pop or break unless you purposely pop it I have had my tube for 2 years now and it still is in perfect condition even after i have used it over and over againOverall- 4 stars I love this tube for its speed and durability ity provides ours of fun in the snow the only flaw that gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is the fact that it isnt really educational.If your child is searching for an amazing snowtube that will provide many hours of enjoyment this is the one.
2,GREAT FUN! But popped on first day.,We had a blast with this sled but it popped on the first day and we weren't abusing it. Just normal use with mostly kids playing on it. The sled trails were a little bumpy but I expected it to last longer than it did.
5,SUMMERSLAM 2005,"Believe Me. I really don't know who is gonna be the better brand. SmackDown's got the ladder match, no holds barred, taker/orton II.Raw's got Icon vs. Legend, Hardy vs. Edge, WWE Championship.(By the way, NO HOLDS BARRED is falls count anywhere)And another thing, people say Hogan's leaving after summerslam. But if anyones seen it, his profile is on the raw page on wwe.com, i mean what would be the point."
5,Hogan steals the show as usual!,"The God of wrestling steals the show as usual. Everyone who knocks Hogan's matches are missing the point. Hogan makes the crowd explode just by his presence. Sports entertainment is all about crowd reaction. It could be the most athletic match of all time, but if the crowd is not into the match who cares? Hogan always delivers the goods whether you like it or not. One single Hogan punch gets a bigger reaction than any of the great moves that HBK can do. Fantastic match between Hogan and HBK!"
1,Worst Summer Slam Ever...........,"Summer Slam is always a great PPV. This one isn't good at all. I don't know why people say ""Hulk Hogan vs. Shawn Micheals"" was the match of the year. That was the crap of the year. Hogan is TTTTTTTOOOOOOOOO old and HBK is to good for Hogan. All I noticed was knife edge chops which they have been doing all thorugh the match. It was SSSSSSSSOOOOOOO easy to tell who was going to win. This was the worst match ever. As a matter of fact, this was worst then Triple H vs. Scott Steiner. Another thing that ruined the PPV was the fact they SCREWED Undertaker at a shot for the World Title. I mean who wants to see a Low life wrestler like JBL fight Batista. This SummerSlam sucked"
3,SummerSlam 06: The summerslam you thought youd never see!,"Hey guys remember Summerslam 1992 was dubbed ""The Summerslam you thought youd never see"". The pay per view didnt go with the summers storylines...instead the WWF decided something new and created fresh storylines and matches right before the pay per view. I heard rumors that the WWF are doing this again for Summerslam 2006:1. Booker T vs Hogan - World2. Edge vs Batista - WWE3. Flair vs Kennedy4. Nitro vs Finley - IC vs US5. Utaker vs Benoit6. HHH vs Masters7. HBK vs Cena8. Show vs Sandman - ECW"
1,Screw you Bischoff!,Im not here to right about the dumb summerslam ppv Im here to right about Y2J getting fired from wrestling!How could you do that to one of the greatest wrestlers of this generation remind you Chris Jericho was the first undisputed champion in wrestling beating the Rock and Stone Cold on the same night?Has your precious wwe champion John Cena did that! No nothing against John Cena or anything because I like Cena but Im just trying to prove a point.What will Raw be without Y2J he's the reason I first started watching Raw in the first place!So screw you Bischoff!
5,DDDDDDDDDXXXXXXXXXX,"1. RKO VS HOGANrandy will have to win if WWE wants him 2 be the next rock.WINNER-RKO2.BOOKER T(c) vs BATISTAthis will probably be a bad matchbut think batista will win the title.winner-Batista3.EDGE(c)vs Cena(loser)I hate Cena !!!!!!! WWE always makes him win ,and im sick of it.I dont really know who will win the match.Since its near cena's town he might win cause of Boston,but Edge cant lose the title again so fast.And also let this be the last match between these two.LET HHH,or Carlito,or even Randy ORTON win the title.Winner-Cena.bbbbbbbbbbbbboooooooooooooooo4.Taker vs Khali Casket matchprobbably will be a slow match.think khali will win because it will lead to buried alive match at survivor series.Winner-Khali5.DX VS MCmahons NO HOLDS BARREDdx will dominate this match.HBK WILL super kick mr.mcmahon.for the win.alot of blood in this match.wINNERS-ddddddddddddddddddxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxso all in all.this was a great paper viewwinners-DDDDDDDDDDDDDXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
3,Questions,"Why does everyone keep putting that fatal fourway match on the card? What about LOD vs. MNM?? Doesn't that seem more probable since they have been buidling that up ever since GAB? Plus, no one cares about the US Championship anymore which is a shame. The intercontinental belt seems to be going the same route as Carlito isn't even gonna defend his belt at Summerslam. This kinda makes me miss the like 12 match pay-per-views from the past. That way they could have two four-way championship matches: Carlito versus Shelton versus Masters vs Big Show and the aforementioned OJ match. Also, what do you people think is the chance that Bret Hart will show up at that HUlk vs Shawn Michaels match? I severly doubt it but talks of him coming back for his dvd have got me thinking."
1,"Gay, not that there's anything wrong with that.","WWE seem to be obsessed with gay sex. Some examples:- Vince McMahon had a club called the Vince McMahon Kiss My Ass Club where he got grown men to kiss his bare ass.- Heidenrich put Michael Cole up agaisnt a wall and raped him from behind.- Viscera's finishing move is a move where he humps his opponent from behind.- John Cena put his ass out and while wiggling it he told Kurt Angle he could do whatever he wants to him.- Ric Flair grabbed Carlito by the balls and then put Carlito's hand in his mouth and sucked on it. He then told him he would take a bite of his ass.- On that same Raw Trevor Murdoch did a promo where he threatened to rape his opponents and make them squeal like pigs.Thats just a few of the many gay moments in WWE but there is much more like Goldust, Billy & Chuck, Rico and The Heart Throbs.So WWE is a gay company. Not that there's anything wrong with that."
2,H.B.K for Life!,This ppv was boring.The whole card of matches sucked with maybe the exception of a few like the Undertaker vs Randy Orton Batista vs J.B.L for the world heavyweight title John Cena vs Chris Jericho for the wwe title and Hulk Hogan vs Shawn Michaels.The rest sucked and hopefully wwe wont screw another big ppv like this one seeing that they have for the past 4 years.P.S Hulk Hogan you need to go ahead and retire because youre old and out of shape and you wrestle like you're on crack!
1,BORING,"Remeber when WWE was acutally good? Those were the days. WWE has really started sucking. Don't waste your money, watch some old WWF tapes from when they didn't suck."

1,Very harmful message,"This book is incredibly inappropriate, especially for the audience it targets (early elementary-aged girls). This is a time our daughters need to trust their parents and NOT keep secrets from them. This book encourages them to do exactly the opposite. It romanticizes the acts of disobeying parental guidelines and keeping potentially harmful secrets. It just made me sick to my stomach as I read it......I allowed my daughter to check it out from the library in a moment of weakness, but from now on there is a moratorium in our house on any ""Disney Princess"" merchandise. We can find much healthier ways to play princess and enjoy the romance of fairy tales on our own."
1,whoever wrote this is not a parent,"like the other parents, i found this to be a terrible story to teach your little girl. the story supports lying and disobeying your father and in the end, there was a happy ending, so she ""obviously"" knew better than dad. not the type of story i would want my teenage daughter to read, let alone a 3yr old."
1,Would not recommend this book,"I purchased this book for my 5 year old daughter, thankfully I decided to read it myself before giving it to her. I am now returning it. Ariel talks about how she disobeyed her father and met Eric as a child. Her father told her humans were dangerous but the ""look in Eric's eyes told her she was not in danger"". In my opinion this books teaches children that it is okay to disobey your parents, and keep secrets from them and everything turns out okay in the end. More importantly it suggests that a child is capable of knowing if a person is dangerous by the way they look."
1,Don't buy it.,The quality of this product was very bad. It was difficult to get working and the sound quality and ergonomics were disappointing and hard to work with. I cannot recommend this product and suggest that you keep looking for something that works and is designed better.
4,"Quirky, fun, mystery","Thoroughly enjoyed this creative, quirky, ""Fargo-esque"" mystery, set in NYC. Funny ensemble cast, especially the 2 sleep clinic med students who monitor their wealthy patients. It took a bit of a deranged mind to think this up, thankfully."
4,Cookbook for quick recipes,"Book arrived in good condition and after several glances at things inside, will certainly be making some meals from this book."
5,"A solid, simple and balanced beginner's guide to cooking","I purchased this book because I figured it was time to learn to cook. Faced with the looming question of what to eat this week, by my girlfriend, I felt shameful in having to say ""I don't know"". And the truth was, I simply DID NOT know what to cook! What should we prepare? What's needed in such and such recipe? These aren't things I think about during the week, as work keeps me busy. And if you're like me, you eat to live, and not vice versa.This book became the perfect solution for me, in that these recipes are simple to make, require little ingredients, and most of all little experience in cooking! They are giving me a solid base for an arsenal of various recipes to use and to answer that not so nearly as dreadful question for me.Bon Appétit!"
1,Smells awful!,"I've only used it once, so I cannot comment on it's effectiveness. It smells awful and is drying. That was enough for me to never touch it again."
2,Projects are so-so.,"This is a beginner's embroidery book. The pictures on stitches were hard to follow on some. I can't figure out if the view is from the front or back of the fabric. There are a few very cute projects, but the rest are just awful. I have to agree with another reviewer. Plus the templates seem to be squished horizontally. Although somewhat useful, there are much better books for beginners... with much cuter projects!"
3,Great for first timers!,"Bought this for my 14 year-old for his birthday. He loves it!. He did point out where the deck is coming off in a couple of places but since it was a biginners board for him to learn on, he says that its ok and is happy with it anyway. Price very reasonable."
2,taken in broad daylight,the acting was ok. i watched it the first time. felt like i wasted my time. to slow for me. i would not buy this dvd if i had known it was not very good
3,Almost ruined by intrusive commentary,"""Parables: Stories Jesus Told"" features text adapted by Mary Hoffman and art by Jackie Morris. This children's book presents several of the classic parables of Jesus of Nazareth. The retold stories include the parables of the good Samaritan, the sower, the prodigal son, the unforgiving servant, and more.The stories are retold with effective simplicity. Morris' artwork is truly wonderful; her warm, rich tones bring to life the Middle East of Jesus' era. Her human faces are full of emotion, and she is also masterful at illustrating sheep, a wheatfield, flatbreads, and other elements.The only bad thing about this book are the preachy, hit-you-over-the-head afterwords that follow each retold parable. These stories are some of the world's great literature, and should be allowed to speak for themselves; for a children's book, they only need the accompaniment of great artwork."
3,Not Quite Sure,"I bought this book without having read much of it first. I know practicaly nothing about Native American studies or shamanism, it's not my calling or interest. Anyways, I bought this one anyway and am sorta confused. Like I said, I know hardly anything at all about Native American culture but I would assume they didnt go out have get pink, blue, yellow, purple, red, oarnge and indigo candles for their work. Almost every working in the book calls for all these rainbow things. I wonder if this is authentic? I am going to borrow from another reviewer I saw a while ago and say This book is probably good for the ""bookstore shaman"" . Thats about all I can say."
5,I know what I'm talking about,I loved reading about J-3's adventuers and his life. Made me wish that I lived on the island paradise of San Felipe and could hang out with J-3 and his pals. Good fun read for a cold winter evening.
3,Great vacation / beach book!,Great light reading -similar to a Jimmy Buffett book. Excellent mix of history and fiction. My only compliant would be that the book sometimes read like a giant ad to sell the Caribbean Traders tee shirts - The author is probably a retired advertising exec.
2,Save your money,"Very disappointing. There is not a single piece of information in this book that is not available for free by reading about a month's worth of messages on the ""Seller Connection"" discussion board that Amazon provides as part of its Seller Resources. The author doesn't seem to have taken the time to do even the most rudimentary independent research. For example he recommends the envelope vendors usually mentioned on the board, whereas a simple independent google search finds a number of cheaper vendors!Of course if you like free information pre-digested and neatly arranged for you, then this book is great. But if that's the case, you might want to reconsider being a bookseller, since a willingness to gather and digest your own information seems to be a basic requirement for success in the field."
5,Excellent,"I completely enjoyed reading this book, finally somebody who relates to me with a great sense of humor! Windwalker offers a lot of great advice and suggestions. A must read for any bookseller A++++++++"
1,total waste of my time and money,"I think this book might be good for beginning booksellers, but for people who have already been selling books a while, this book was a total waste of time and money. I got the impression he wasn't going to reveal any of his secrets or strategies for buying and selling books,he gave me nothing useful and there wasn't anything at all that I found here to take away and apply.It would be better to write a book to be published upon your death if you are worried that people may use the information to compete against you,which apparently is his concern here."
2,"Good advice, if you want to starve.","I took all the advice given in this book and put it into immediate practice. One year later, I can barely put food on my table.Be very careful if you try to start your own store. Keep your day job. Most people lose money in this venture! Be warned!"
4,Very good book for someone exploring a home business.,"I have enjoyed this little book. As someone who is exploring the idea of a home business, I find it very helpful. He gives, I think, a very realistic idea of the amount of work and money involved in starting a small business at home selling books online. Although the online world changes so quickly, I find, as we transition from 2002 to 2003, the information is still relevant. I would like to see more information on tax issues. I will definitely have to search for a book or two on that subject."
2,Not Really Worth It,"As a beginner, this book was a real disappointment. I'm sure Mr. Windwalker had better advice but kept it to himself. If you're just curious, go for it. But I certainly did not find $17 worth of information it in--nothing I didn't already know that is."
1,hurting real booksellers,"Books like this are a real travesty because they undercut real booksellers who own stores and are trying to make a living out of it. Those who sell online as a ""hobby"" are the worst because they do not have to worry about any profit margins, as long as they can re-sell a book for more than they paid for it it is a win for them. Anyone who had been selling books for a living would have spent enough time around them to have done the research and know all the things that are contained within this book. So, all I see this book doing is creating an avenue for people who won't take the time to understand books and book dealing to be able to sell books and steal business from hard working book dealing individuals. Don't read this book...and remember book selling is a PROFESSION not a hobby and shouldn't be taken lightly or trifled with. This is someone's life and deserves to be treated with respect."
5,"Stop, do not pass go, prior to reading this book!","Wow! Down to earth, entertaining information that I wish to heck I had prior to starting what has been one of my biggest delights and one of the biggest headaches I have ever known.I left a job due to high stress levels and needed a way to make some money. I had bought a few books from Amazon and decided that I might be able to turn some of my already reads into some cash. Amazon sales has now become my main source of income.Stephen Windwalker has written a book that takes you from the simplest nuts and bolts explanation of how to list a book all the way to properly dealing with Uncle Sam. His comments are accurate and if I had read his book sooner I could have saved some significant dollars. Some of the other books I have read on this subject left me wondering what world the author lived in (cause it sure wasn't this one).If you intend to sell on Amazon for fun and profit, READ THIS BOOK."
3,Lacks some center,"When minor league progster's Anekdoten concentrate on grooving a jam sans vocals it can become stimulating, but usually epic buildup is squandered by undercooked progressions."
3,"Very versitly toy, but there are better options.","These are great. We use them on the car seat and the jumperoo. She can reach out for them and pull on them. They are enticing colors.However, they were not long enough for her to reach when she was 4-6 months old. Now that she can reach them (6-8 months), they do not hold her attention long because they do not make much noise. She needs other toys in addition to these. Actually her Lamaze Freddie the FireFly has a lot more features and keeps her preoccupied in her car seat. If I had it to do over again I would have just purchased the firefly."
1,not as advertised,"These little bugs look so cute as advertised, but that's not what I received. I received these ugly, cheap looking buggys. I returned them."
1,Royal PITA,"This is an unbelievably bad thing to buy. There are so many bad things about it, it is hard to know where to begin...Perhaps the beginning. Nightmare installation software that warns it can hurt the operating system. Battery that will not hold a charge even when plugged into cigarette lighter. Technical support from Calcutta that never once would just answer the most basic questions. e.g. Are you breathing? Please hold sir, while I check into that. Really bad."
5,Dogs like it,"If you have a picky eater, this may help. Put a little on and stir it to lightly coat the food. Also an easy way to give them added vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.My dogs love it, so it must taste good to them. LOL"
1,Not so much,The product burns cleans which is what I wanted but the color is so dull and unappealing that I feel like I want to pour it out and start over with something else. I set my wick a little higher to make it burn faster to work my way thru it.
1,NOT FIT FOR A CHILD,"DANGEROUS!!! Front Wheel bearing seperated from wheel, child could have gotten hurt.I Returned it to the store. They said they had 5 others that had been returned due to disfunctional equipment, employee said they were junk. Wish I was told that before I bought it and put my child on a dangerous toy. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND WHATSOEVER!!!!!"
2,"A toy, with no responsibility being sold!","Having gotten it for a couple of days, tt injured my friend's kids. They send mailed to Honda Motors, they are slow to return replies. Now, their legal councilor is suggesting suing Honda for this unthoughtful toy.The very bad and unfortunate thing is that your kid won't learn algebra, not physics, nor skills that help them succeed in school with this toy.If your kid does not know how to balance on a bike, how to stop, how to turn, stay away from this non-educational toy. Only if you want your kids to be exposed to as high of a risk as the kind of Formula racings injuries; including broken joints, bones, head injuries and scratches, should you consider buying this piece of junk."
5,i found an an upgraded engine,okay here is how you get the upgraded engine you got to this web site www.superkidsonline.com then go to CURRIE ELECTRIC SCOOTER PARTS and look for 12volt engines
5,LOVE IT!,"My 4 year old got this for his birthday and he absolutely loves it. He didn't even want to eat his birthday cake because he wanted to get back on. Even though he's not the recommended 8 years old, he had no problem figuring out how to stay up and now that he has learned some balance he can even ride his bicycle without training wheels. This has got to be his most favorite toy ever."
1,IS THIS A FREAKIN JOKE?!?!??!?!?!?!,"wow, a new moter bike that i always wanted!! i try it out and i can crawl backwards faster then this thing can move, it was a complete lie that it is for ages 8-14!!!!!!!! when i start it it makes this squeeking noise and it is a stupid waist of money and it works like crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!``IF ANYTHING, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS BIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!!!!!!"
2,MORE POWER??,"i was jus wonderin if any of you guys knew how to increase the power, im sure it doesnt go 10 mph. i heard about you could get a second switch to make it faster, i was wondering how to do that, thanks.....(...)"
1,never had anything so bad in my life,I realy realy realy realy hate this bike so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much. This bike is a real rip off. This stupid bike was $200 thats to much for a dang thing like this. I think this bike should be $15. I hate this stupid peice of crap.I hate it.
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought the Honda MiniMoto racer for my son's 7th birthday. I was impressed with the sleek design, and that was about it. The reccomended age is 8 and up. I feel it more like for ages 4-6. It is extremely small,(Our german shepard pup is bigger), and awkward for a 7 year old to ride. (My 7 yr old looks like he's riding a toddler toy). The speed is also much slower than expected. My son can go much faster on a traditional bicycle. I feel this product would be great for smaller children who can already balance theirself on a bicycle."
2,crap,this little minimoto is crap i got one and it goes so slow i liked it at first but then i had it for a week and then returned i got the yamaha r1 replica pocket bike and it can hit 60mph.it alsome get a gas powered pocket bike instead of this.
1,Don't buy it,"I bought this for my son last year for X-mas. He was able to ride it 3 times, after that, it won't take a charge. The fastest it went might have been 5 miles an hour. It looks good but not worth the money. Now it sits in my garage, not sure what to do with it."
2,Don't waste your money,"We bought the Honda mini moto for my son for Christmas and after only a few hours of riding time on the bike got to the point where it wouldn't pull him, it would just quit going. The battery still had full charge and it would run when you lifted up the back end but not with weight on it. I tried to contact mini moto for a week and was finally able to leave a voice mail to contact me. A couple of days went by and no response from the company, so I sent an email, again several days went by with no response. I took the bike back to the store and bought the Razor PR200 pocket bike. There is no comparison to the quality from the Razor to the Mini moto...too much to list. Take my advise buy the Razor PR200 instead of the Honda Mini moto. Now my son is happy with his bike. P.S. the Razor is much faster than the Mini moto."
1,Mini NO-GO,"This is a really fun too..... HOWEVER.... Beware!!!! I have read over a dozen reviews on this and the consist theme is ""THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK!!!"". The electrical system works about as long as Thomas Edison's first light bulb. Actually, our Mini-NO-GO lasted about 4 hours. It died, my son cried, and Honda could care less. Check the internet for other reviews and see for yourself. Don't waste your money - you too will be very disappointed."
3,Training Wheels,"Tara, et al..You might try using generic bicycle training wheels from any bike shop or even Walmart, etc. Be sure to get good quality training wheels (metal mounts and rubber not plastic wheels) and mount them securely to the rear axle bolts.FYI.. if this item does not work out for you, you might try the Razor Pocket Rocket. It goes faster (up to actual of 17 mph with 60-80 pound rider) and seems to be build better. That is what we have and we have customize it with accessories - lights, saftey flag, loud horn, speedometer, etc. Good luck!"
1,Terrible,"How do you tell a 5 yr old that Santa brought him a toy that is horible. He got it for Christmas and rode it in the house and loved it. When summer came he got about 8 hours of riding before he was in tears. [...] Don't waste your time or have your child disappointed. It looks great, but ends up a headache. My son is so upset and i don't know what to tell him. 200.00 gone and out the window. It is the same as all other reviews, battery is good, but the main box is bad. Horrible........Honda should be a shame to have their name on this bike."
2,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"I purchased one of these minimotos as a birthday gift for my son and he enjoyed it so much that I went back and bought another one for my other son. After 3 months they BOTH stopped working. After purchasing a battery, troubleshooting on the phone for hours, and becoming very frustrated, I was told that I would have to replace the MOTORS MYSELF before I could get any kind of reimbursement. THIS IS A JOKE - I had to saw off a screw to even get to the battery!!! I even purchased two Toys R Us Protection Plans for $50.00 - all together a HUGE waste of $$ - 3 months of use for $199.00 is not worth it!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This Bike Stinks,When I got this bike I thought it was cool. But NO! this bike is for 3 year olds and Im 9. this bike only goes 10 mph I need faster I can even run faster than that. Im planing to sell it and hope to make some money on this stuped bike. It deos not go up hills very good. Every time this dumn bike runs out of juice I have to wait 12 hours of charging up for this bike to go only 10 mph. I have had problems for two yaers. THE END no sory stuped Honda minimoto sport racer bike/baby scum now THE END
1,go for a petrol,"If you read the law about these minimotos you can only ride them on private land(not sidewalks), so for the same price you can get one thats run on petrol and can do up to 50mph!! if you want to go for speed thats the one one for you, but safety wise the electric one is a better buy. 1 thing, if you get a petrol one you have to remember they are scaled down sports bikes and rarely a week goes by with you needing to do nothing to it,like fit a new spark plug or unclog the petrol supply. Whatever you do remember they are both illegal on sidewalks."
5,second switch,The Bike is awsome but I don't like how sow it goes. Where do I find the second switch for the mini moto. I have looked in currie scooter parts. (superkidsonline.com) But I haven't found anything except the 12 volt battery. Thanks for making such a cool toy for us.
5,mini moto tips on making it faster,the honda mini moto bike is one of the best toy i ever had write now iam waiting on a 12v motor from superkidsonline on my bike second switch button and looking online for something to make it go faster and all that adds up to about 20 mph (...)
1,DONT BUY ONE.,THE HONDA I GOT WORKED FOR 20 MINS AND THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOUR MONEY OR GIVE YOU CREDIT SO DONT BUY ONE THEY DONT WORK 200.00 GONE FOR JUKE.
1,Quality Is Not A Word To Be Used For This Product,"Bought this for my son for Christmas, and he used it one time. Worked great, he really enjoyed the 45 minutes of riding. After that it would not charge. Have been calling the ToyQuest support center, which does answer phones, and they've been sending parts. I try to point them to what I think is the problem (seems rather obvious being an electrical engineer) and they keep sending what they think is wrong based on most frequently failed items. They don't much want to hear about actual symptoms. Also they tend to want to send whatever is out of stock, so it takes about a month to get any part. Anyway, in 3 months, one ride, it has not worked since and don't know when it will work again if ever. Though the concept is nice, there are a lot better ways to lose your money than on this low quality product."
1,Don't buy this toy!!!!!,"I bought this for my son at Christmas. The bike is very cool if it actually ever worked. I have left 4 messages, sent 3 emails, talked to 3 customer service reps and even left them a credit card number to send me the part I needed to make this work. This is a terrible company to deal with. If you have purchased this toy, I strongly recommend that you purchase the extended warranty becuase this piece of junk will break!"
1,Waste of money,"I think this toy is a total waste of money. First of all the battery only last for one hour,The charger came faulty and it is to small for a eight year old.Honda should be ashamed to have there name on a product like this."
1,terrible product support,The bike has been able to be used twice in the last four months.The rest of the time has been spent waiting for parts from the worst customer support organization I have ever dealt with.Don't buy it!!
3,not as good as the gas one,i have ridden a razor mini bike that was electric from academy and it goes so...... slow and i have never ridden the electric pocket bike but the gas one is a lot better anyways so i suggest people get the gas one if your the right age.
3,I expected more!,Besides the fights that are hard to see because they were shot in the dark and the nsubtitles that are hard to read most of the time this is a good movie.Very bloody with good fight scenes.The one you can see that is.
1,Not really my thing,"I was disappointed in this novel and found myself bored by it. Pretty much there's this pervy artist type (Sartain) living in a castle in the mountains who needs a 'manager' to run his business. This guy specializes in paintings of a... Ahem risque nature. I liked the character Natalie, liked the way she handled herself but John Sartain left me cold. I have no patience for spoiled artist types and he and his fetish pictures seemed a little silly to me. I like my heroes to be mature men and Sartain seemed like a freak who liked to paint dirty pictures. Instead of seeming sexy like the author intended I found the man distinctly creepy. 1 star. Not my thing I guess..."
5,Don't Miss this one!,"This book is one of my favorites so far in the Blaze line! Gothic and sexy, you will fall in love with the characters!"
4,$888.00,"Guys be very careful just clicking ""add to cart."" There is one vendor that has this $40 basket listed for $888.00. I guess trying to take advantage of someone not paying close attention or in a hurry. Use caution. I just wanted to post this warning and hopefully the vendor ""HeavenSentbyrevdwl"" will remove it soon! TC."
5,Great!!!,This product is great!!! A wonderful gift for my mom! Thank you!(Este producto es grandioso!!! Un regalo maravilloso para mi mamá! Gracias!)
2,Cheaply put together assortment,You get a lot of 'stuff' but none of it is of high quality. Very little fragrance and it all comes from China. My wife was not impressed.
4,Nice gift,"This came in a nice basket, smelled great, it was received as a gift well. Arrived in great shape. Thankd"
1,wrong product,"i order vanilla got avacodo damaged also lots of stuffing ,for the price they could of added other bottle of the bath oil."
3,Wife liked it.,Its made in China....Expect that kind of quality when opening it and seeing whats inside. As long as the ladies happy!
5,Thank you for the remasters,Picked this up while I was in London in Sept 98. The remastering is fantastic. And all the extra trax aloneare worth replacing your original copy for. Alas notavailable as a domsetic release in the US spend the money& get this version !!!!
5,"""Everyday Is Like Sunday""- the passion, the desperation, the wit, the beauty of opened hearted truth, who could ask for more.","I love this disc, I never go for very long without listening to it. I plan to take it to my grave.PeaceThe*Hot*Wax*Kid"
3,Probably not what you expect!,"So do you think this is going to teach you how to play, lets say, a buzz roll, or perhaps even a closed-sounding single stroke roll, with one hand? I did. Basically, here's what it trains you to do: place the tip of your stick on the head, then bring the rest of the stick down on the rim, then rock the tip back down on the head. Repeat, building up speed. The author has perfected this technique to good effect, but I find the marketing and advertising of this product a little slick and misleading, as there is no clue that the technique being taught is something different from what any drummer with a knowledge of the rudiments would consider a standard roll. (I wondered why, on his promotional online video, you never see his hands once he goes into the ""roll."") On the other hand, this did expand my horizon by introducing an idea to my drumming that I simply had never considered before."
2,Cute,"This bunny wall art is cute. The colors didn't really match the bedding all that well. I really thought about taking it back--but I didn't know what to do on the wall. So, I just put the bunny wall art around wooden letters that spelled out my daughters name. I am not creative anymore but it works!!"
1,wrong list of songs,"I never expected to buy an original CD to find out that it had all the songs in different order. It seems to be either a fake or a defective item because the order of the songs was a mess... Im doubting about the authenticity of the CD, or it might be a factory mistake... I dont know..."
1,Boring,"I picked this book up at a used book store because I thought it might have a new theories on DaVinci - and I'm always in need of a book to read at the beach. It's obvious this book was re-tooled to capitalize on the success of Dan Brown's DaVinci Code. But the errors in the ""updating"" drove me crazy. Things like 'eleven years ago after 9/11' or how the hero applied to Oxford in 1966 after serving in the First Persian Gulf War.There was no action, no suspense. The book was predictable. Halfway through I was rooting for the bad guys to just kill Vance and be done with it. I did not enjoy this book at all."
2,Oh you must be kidding,Well .... you might enjoy this book if you are willing to suspend all disbelief .... and I mean ALL. To say the plot is incredible (in the literal meaning of that word) is an understatement. It is diverting but the updated paperback has topical references that are both unnecessary and ridiculous (its reference to 9/11 coming to mind).I give it points for being diverting. In other respects it is just plain lousy.
1,"""Da Vinci"" In the title does not a classic make....","Note that the reviews posted by the publisher are for ""Daughter of God"". Even the publisher couldn't find a good word about this book. It died a miserable death in 1983; and deservedly so. But the success of Dan Brown with the Code has allowed every story with Da Vinci in the title to be dusted off and reprinted. With such riveting dialogue as ""Let go, you crazy Brit!"" during a struggle for a gun and ""Hey, watch it"" during a chase scene, the book just lacks literary creativity. And the attempts to update it just make it worse. Lire are now Euros (but the conversion factor?), and we now know that the first gulf war took place in the early '60's. The dates have not been changed, so the hero would be about 60 in the updated version. A good friend gave me the book so I suppose I'll slog through the rest of it. It IS a quick read; there's THAT going for it!"
1,"Mostly Violence, Little Plot","It sounded interesting. I had read Daughter of God and as I recall, that was pretty good. The DaVinci Legacy on the other hand, is all about violence. By the end of the book, I think about half of western Europe must have been dead. Yuk."
5,A real grabber from start to finish,"the Da Vinci legacy grabbed me from the very first page to the very last.The scene of the man being impaled on the cross in the church in Pisa was absolutely riveting as was the way the heroine gets the reluctant hero to jump off the roof of the monastery into Lake Como.I found it interesting that the bad guy who set up the spectacular death was named,""The Schoolmaster."" Rather similar I would think to that bad guy in Da Vinci Code called ""The Teacher.""I did find the level of violence here rather high, but then all the previews and reviews of Mel Gibson's ""Passion"" said the same thing. It seems that religious fervor does inspire more than its share of blood and gore. The Catholic Church's Inquisition set a new standard for this as Perdue pointed out in his other book, Daughter of God."
2,Needs to be re-editied,"Although the story itself is good enough to keep a reader interested, the countless errors in the novel are distracting. The book was first published in the early 80s, so in an effort to make the book more ""current,"" the publishers added lines about 9/11, the Gulf War, etc. However, they don't fit with the timeline and dates given in the book. For instance, one character discusses an event that happened in 1975 as though it were yesterday, then they mention someone as being a Gulf War vet. They talk about being in Beruit, then skip to Gulf War Iraq as though they happened back to back, rather than decades apart. The anachronisms only jumble the story. They probably should have left the origianl novel alone and just republished it (like the Bourne Identity, which - although very dated with phonebooths rather than cellphones - is a very good read). I would not recommend this book."
1,A complete waste,"This book was absolutely awful. The action was irrelevant to the storyline. The characters were extremely underdeveloped; weak, stereotypical villains, and lead characters that seemed like they were yanked from a cheap romance novel. The dialogue was amateurish and downright embarrassing.I read this because I liked the Da Vinci Code. That book was no paragon of western literature, but for an action thriller it was well written and had an interesting plot. Da Vince Legacy is none of those things. Don't waste your time."
4,"Much better than ""Code""","Lewis Perdue has done a much better job with plotting and character development than any other daVinci novelists I have read, including The DaVinci Code (2 stars) and Hudson Hawk (1 star). The re-release of this book was no doubt inspired by the success of Dan Brown's book. The decision of whether or not Brown plagarized this book (originally released in 1983) is being deliberated by the Bristish courts. I fear that Mr. Brown's ""facts"" may have been taken from Mr. Perdue's fiction. I would recommend this book highly (and , indeed, have done so with many friends)."
1,The absolute worst of modern fiction?,"Oh... my... GodThis truly is a car crash of a novel.From talk of the ""cambridge university campus"" (which does not/has never existed - there is not even a central student's union!)2D characters, plot lines left flailing in the wind.Never before have I been so confident of writing a publishable novel myself!"
4,"Fun, fast paced read","""The Da Vinci Legacy"" is an entertaining, fast paced, thriller about ancient conspiracies and secret societies. The story follows Vance Eriksson in his pursuit of some missing documents by Leonardo Da Vinci, while being followed by unknown killers. He finds an unlikely ally in journalist Suzanne Storm.The novel is fast paced, with lots of action and some nice conspiracy touches. My only complaint is the sloppy update in the 2004 edition (the novel was first published in 1983) which has resulted in some weird anachronisms and inconsistencies in time and setting. If you can overlook this, it's a fun, quick read. 4-"
1,"Bad, really bad.","I was interested to read this book after a local bookseller recommended it.All I can say is I have no idea why it was suggested. Honestly the plot isn't so bad - just poorly executed. But the bad writing together with the stilted sad dialogue, one dimensional characters, and the most hideous, unbelievable love story I've ever read made this book amost impossible to get through.I often had to stop reading just to say to myself ""this book is terrible.""I only finished it becasue I was hoping it would get better, if anything it got worse.I would never, ever suggest that anyone read this book...ever."
1,The First Americans: Corridor of Storms,"I did not like this book because of the pointless and unexpected violence contained within. It had no redeeming qualities in my opinion. If you like prehistoric fiction, as I do, I would recommend Daughter of the Red Deer by Joan Wolf, She Who Remembers by Linda Lay Shuler, and Coyote Woman by Judith Redman Robbins. If violence doesn't bother you, I would recommend Lost River by Paxton Riddle. It is based on true historical events of the Modoc Indians and is interesting, fast moving and changed my way of thinking."
1,did not watch,"I reviewed this movie 1 star but I didn't even watch it. when I purchased it in late 2006, I though I was getting THE NOVELA : Secreto de Amor. when I recived it , I was so sad and literally THREW it away. I should have sold it back, but I didn't even know how to, back then. such a shame. oh well"
3,Ese un grande arma.,"I'm not fluent in Spanish but I decided to watch this movie first in Spanish, then in English. The director placed a variety of still moments within the movie. This gives a sense of the environment that the viewer is in; also downs the tempo of movie (which may be too slow for some people). The movie does a good job with character history, flashbacks are aided to help with the character's background. There is some truth to the events of each of the character's background in our world. Such as: the farmers and the man with guns, kidnappings, homicidal politicians. I think the plot of the movie works on a Freudian level, it is a 'love' movie after all.The soft core sex scene gets an A."
4,Surprisingly contemporary novel,"While this book was published in the 1930's I found it surprisingly contemporary. The main story was of a doctor unjustly blamed for the death of one of his patients. This book does have romance as its main story with a satisfying ending, but I liked the way the author also showed how some deal with injustice well and some deal with it not so well. Each of us has a 'sob story' that we can overcome or which can overcome us. There were several side stories as well and I think much of this novel describes the human condition from the 1930's as well as from our current time."
1,uncanny,"I love the way all the positive reviews of this self published book are in the exact same 'voice', it is uncanny. It is almost as if they had all been written by the same person :-)"
4,Easy read,"Every once in a while, you need something that's easy to read. Something where you don't have to keep notes or a list of characters. This fills the bill. Also having been raised in Cleveland, makes it all the better."
3,real mystery alright,the book started out great but it dragged throughout until 80 pages to go. I figured out why the man was killed but I didn't know who the killer was. It was a decent book but I hope the follow up has more to his personal life. I went ahead and bought vol.2 FULL CLEVELAND. I really liked the shortness of the story
3,Disappointed that it didn't follow the book.,"The book ""Looking for Lincoln"" begins with his assassination and chronicles his impact on the 60 years that followed. The DVD, although well done, was just another biography. I expected to see what I had read not the same old stuff about his early life, etc."
1,Read the Book; Avoid the Movie,"The book, Looking for Lincoln, is fascinating. But Henry Louis Gates's pseudo-intellectual show that's an attempt to cash in on the book is lowbrow at best. It might have been charming if it had been written and hosted by a sixth-grader, but Gates presenting himself as though he were a sixth-grader is a waste of our time and money. The comments made by the historians are worthwhile, but read their books instead of wasting your money on this nonsense."
2,Looking for Lincoln,"I watched this PBS presentation on TV when, during the Lincoln centennial, lots of Lincoln programs were being aired. If you're looking for Lincoln I suggest you look elsewhere (Abraham and Mary Lincoln; a House Divided). What you find here barely scratches the surface. Topics are raised and then quickly dropped. One subject that was not dropped however was the lengthy interview with George W. Bush who tries to convince the viewer that he, too, like Lincoln had to deal with serious threats to the Nation. Lincoln suspended habeas corpus (so did George) but, to paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen in his debate with Dan Quayle -- ""Mr. President, you're no Lincoln"". Skip this video; there are much better histories of Lincoln than this production."
3,Koto Pleasantries (and occasional surprises),"The last time John Zorn's Tzadik label released a solo koto album was back in 1998, with Yagi Michiyo's firey, avant-garde 'Shizuku'. Anyone expecting more of the same here, though, will be in for a disappointment - 'Jumping Rabbit' has to be one of the ""nicest"" albums Zorn and co have ever released. Almost too much so, in places: there's something just a little too New Age-ish about 'Fly Away' and 'Dreams', while the wide-eyed childlike vocals on 'Moon Park' and 'Paper Airplane' are, to put it mildly, a bit of an acquired taste. Fortunately, there's a bit of tension elsewhere: the jaunty, off-kilter blurts of 'Jumping Rabbit' and cyclical figures of 'Charm Music Box' are as musically adventurous as they are technically impressive. Ditto the likes of 'Midnight Forest' and 'Red + Balloon', although it's hard not to wish that they'd been fleshed-out a little beyond their meager running times."
2,ok read,It was an okay read. Slightly sluggish. I had to make myself read through the book to the end just so it wasn't a waste of my money.
5,Wow! Gut-wrenching tales by physicians with a flair for writing.,"True dramas from the E.R., some funny, some sad, some horrifying.And these docs can write. Contributors include marquee names such as Ethan Canin, Sam Shem, Michael Palmer, Perri Klass, & Richard Selzer. Other, ""less well known"" contributors have been recognized by the Pushcart Prize, Pulitzer Prize, & Best American Short Stories Anthology. As a fan of the television show ER, my interest in the book was piqued by the flattering review in Kirkus Reviews. Interestingly, the editor is himself an emergency room resident training in a Chicago trauma center (just like the actors in the popular television show). If you enjoy the TV show, you'll love this collection."
3,"Not the best book of ER stories, but it's good","Most of the stories in this book are good; a few are great and a few are boring. While it is not as compelling as ""Believe It or Not! True Emergency Room Stories"" or ""Emergency: True Stories from the Nation's ERs"", it is definitely a book that you won't regret buying."
5,Clifford Makes A Friend,"This is an excellent book for beginning readers. There is a lot of repetition and simple words early readers will recognize. And of course, it's Clifford!"
3,Misleading Introduction,The introduction to this book is incorrect. The author is not the editors of the Urantia Foundation. This book is the Fifth Epochal Revelation translated from English to Spanish.Gerald
1,pure heresy,"This is just an evil ""expansion"" and distortion of the bible.if you want to be deceived by heresy this book is what you need."
1,Solo Religion-,Este libro solo es util para personas que buscan una sensacion confortable a partir de su religion. No recomiendo a nadie que sea agnostico o ateo participar de este libro.
3,LECTURA DE SUMA IMPORTANCIA PARA AMPLIAR NUESTRO INTELECTO,"URANTIA: ""Libro y Lectura"" son cuestiones quizás tan maravillantes, sorprendentes e ilustrativas como ""la Biblia"", ""El Corám"" o incluso tan enigmático como el ""Sefer Ha Zohar"".La vida y el universo, dos conceptos vivos e infinitos del tamaño de D-os y tan ambiosos por escudriñarlas, aquí se conjugan armoniosamente de cierta manera con inteligibilidad para unos e inmensas y casi infinitas profundidades inalcanzables para otros en razón de su conocimiento; lo demás, simplemente, depende de nuestra espiritualidad y fe. Finalmente: ¿qué nos llevamos de este mundo que antes no lo hayamos conocido cuando los tiempos de revelaciones están por venir?"
5,Un libro de cabecera,"Despues de leer la biblia y otros libros religiosos, este libro no debe faltar en tu cabecera. Si buscas un poco de paz y muchas respuestas, aqui las encuentras. Es una aventura de fe para aquellos que no son miedosos. Si tienes dudas o temores es mejor esperar a madurar. Pero si tienes fe y confianza en Dios y estas listo para adentrarte mas en los misterios del universo, este libro es para ti."
1,Way too clever for his readers' good... Every story is about the same thing: William Tenn,"I'm sorry fans, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get past the ""cleverness"" of these so called stories---can a story be a story with neither characters nor scene? Tenn's ""stories"" have neither. They are merely whimsical commentaries on nonsensical situations and, must have been written in front of a mirror, so self-focused are they. We are never allowed to feel anything other than the author's cynicism. We are never allowed to see anything happen. Instead we are offered blather only an intellectual could love.Though I'm a collector of many of NESFA's great golden age SF, this is one writer who should have been allowed to vanish into the mists of pulp history. If it's good stories you're looking for, skip this one and instead go for James H. Schmitz, Chad Oliver or James Triptree."
1,DHP-100,"I bought a couple of these. One of the two died on me the first hour of attempted use. Amazon was kind enough to send me another, but as it is, I never got them to work for me. And I checked the polarity of my outlets, they were fine. Tech support from D-Link must have taken lessons from David Spade in the credit card commercial. Sure, they try to help you out, but you can forget getting them to take them back. No. No. No. They'll use any excuse they can think of...they went through two or three with me.I advise you to avoid this product."
1,Not worth the money,"I had read the reviews and still bought it...My bad.This isn't a book. This is a pamphlet that explains what point spread, moneyline and parlay means. In the time it would take for it to be mailed to you, you could learn everything in it and write it yourself."
3,For Blackfoot fans only,"As stated by the previous reviewer, this is the exact same copy of the King Biscuit Flower hour cd without the interview with Ricky Medlocke and without the fancy booklet or any information period (it is just a cd cover, that is all)The cd runs at 45 minutesWhile the sound quality is better than the KBFH it is still not up to snuff in my opinion compared to other KBFH recordings and certainly not like the RECORD: Highway Song live.I suggest you go to the reviews of Blackfoot KBFH, they are good as well.I would not want to turn on a person to Blackfoot with cd because it would probably turn him/her off due to the sound quality and the rushed playing.However, for a Blackfoot fan, the price is right, thus receives 3 stars or 6/10"
1,Recorded When?,"When you find recordings of old groups that you like, pay attention to when the recording was made. After 20 years the vocals sound a bit -- old. In fact, this recording sounded like it was recorded with an old 5 lb. Shure mic hung from the ceiling."
5,A BEAUTIFUL TREAT,"This book is another stunning sucess for Fleming. Beautiful illustrations, which employ autumn-ish color schemes, make for a visual treat, while the story conveys a wonderful message of social responsibility. Highly recommended for bedtime as well as discussions about hibernation (all the information about each animal's hibernation behavior is accurate, and obviously researched)."
3,Time to Sleep,Most of the animals in this book relate to the USA I wanted a simple explanation for my grandson about hibernation. Considering I spent more on postage than the actual book I was disappointed in the content because there is not much of a story. It was an expensive way to get the message across .
4,Great for preschoolers!,My preschool class loved this book. It was a great way to show them how many different animals hibernate besides bears without having to go into too much detail. The pictures were beautiful. We were asked to read this book over and over and over again all week long!
4,Short and sweet,"My favorite part of all of Denise Fleming's children's books are her very unique illustrations. She uses a very different technique where she basically makes her own paper, that creates very interesting pictures. The story itself gives a very good introduction on the topic of hybernation in a fun way for children. It is simple, yet you stayed interested in the story. You meet a lot of interesting animals throughout the story, and the story even has a fun twist at the end."
5,NICE,I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND WAS HAPPY TO GET IT. I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE TRACK 'IN THE WAITING'. GOOD BUY
5,Great Great Great Artist! Great album!,"I love this album and artist. I bought it a couple of years back, but misplaced my copy, and never realized how much I missed the album until ""Holy"" (track 10) popped into my head one day and wouldn't leave! I just had to search for the album again. As the last reviewer said, this is an overlooked talent. He deserves so much more popularity and appreciation of talent. All his lyrics are things I can relate to; His words portray do not ""instant holiness"" like most gospel artistes, but a struggle to get there like the rest of us real-life Christians pass through. Please buy this album. It's worth every cent and more."
5,Just what I was after,"Just what I wanted...enough magnification without being too scary. Gave it as a gift for someone living in a small space and she was thrilled. It has a nice, clean look."
5,Met all expectations,The mirror arrived promptly on the date promised. It included all mounting hardware and took only a few minutes to install. So far it has performed as advertised.
4,Constance of York: from shadow to spotlight,"This novel is well researched, well constructed and well presented. Constance of York, Lady le Despenser, steps from the shadows of history onto the fully lit stage of life.It is no mean feat for an author to bring lesser known historical figures to life in a way which is both accessible to the modern reader and sympathetic to 'known' historical fact.It is a special author indeed who can do this while at the same time teaching a reader about the times, not just presenting knowledge.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in enjoying a well-written novel while, at the same time, learning some of the history in which it is set."
1,Disappointed,"I opened this book with such high hopes only to be frustrated and disconcerted by oddities that seemed out of time. Perhaps it is my own bias, but I do not like such phrases as ""like he was confronted with an alternate universe"" when the time period is 14th century. I found Constance portrayed as a modern woman rather than a woman at a time when the women were not considered equal to men. This out of time feeling was unnecessary from my perspective and off-putting...to such an extent that I stopped reading halfway through, something I very rarely do. I will be more wary in future, and will certainly not spend money on this author again."
2,Mediocre quality,I was not prepared for the bad sound. But as a diehard fan this was an important add to my collection. Nice to have the collected to one item. Very nice booklet.
2,Why isn't this free?,"This kind of material should be available on the net for free. It is, with younger artists. Sadly, this is more of the Springsteen repackaging phenomena, making a dollar on whatever.The interviews are nice, though earlier material, especially WHFS and WMMR in 1974, would have been more fun.What ever happened to the spirit of rock and roll? Bruce should take lessons from the Dead and the Clash."
5,"Great music, great performances...","These suites are wonderful pieces of music by Marin Marais. They range from the heroic to the melancholic. The viol has such an intimate timbre and the recordings preserve that quality. If you like intimate, melancholic music then scoop this one up right away!!"
3,Not for College!,"I have to use my phone as an alarm for school. Works normally, except when it just decides that I don't need to go to class. The alarm never goes off sometimes. Other than that I love the phone. Just beware."
1,Horrible..,"So its time to basically upgrade my service plan and so I decide to splurge on a nice phone without paying anything near 200. I saw the ""worlds smallest cameraphone"" at a decent price $90 and decide that its right for me, especially since it would be my first camera phone. I take it home, after 1 day, I am completely dissatisfied with the phone. Here's why:1) The camera quality is disheartening, something I should've expected when buying a VGA camera, although I've seen MUCH nicer quality VGA cameras.2)The flash is incredibly weak. It basically defeats the purpose of having a flash. At night time, it literally wont have any kind of effect unless your subject is less than a foot away.3)The entire set up of the phone and its features are weak and severely lacking. I understand that its the ""worlds smallest camera phone"" but nonetheless I expect more features than a Firefly.On the 2nd day, I went ahead and returned it and got the Nokia 6030."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Too good to be true? Yep! You CANNOT port another number to this service contract and if you change your service in any way, they will stick you with a $250 charge. If you don't care what phone # they give you, then go for it. If you are just trying to save a few bucks, don't bother. Time is more valuable than getting this mess straight!"
5,"Very, very cool phone","I am 16 years old and I find this phone to be really cool. It is extremely small and anyone can lose this phone if they do not keep it with them at all times. I would advise anyone to buy a carrying case. When I am using this phone, I get numerous comments about the size. To anyone who is buying this phone I would say, ""GO FOR IT!""."
5,Cats on the Counter taught me a lot about my cat,"Cats on the counter taught me a lot about my cat. Learning that she is scratching the couch to spread her scent, not to create disaray in my living room, went a long way to help me work with her instead of against her. Also learning that she receives stability from her territory being stable helped me make choices that better provide her with that security. As with his last book, Dr. Lachman talks about dealing with the loss of a pet, and I think that is an important aspect of owning a pet. The book contains wonderful true life experiences, and is easy to read and follow. If you have a cat or know a cat, you should read this book."
5,A book of infinite value to assist my canine clients !,"""CATS ON THE COUNTER is an exceptionally clear, well-written, and helpful book that advocates the exemplary whole-family approach to resolving pet behavior problems. On a personal level, Larry Lachman and Frank Mickadeit's book will be of infinite value to me as I assist my canine clients who've been having trouble blending with their feline family members. What's more,this book makes even a total dog-person like myself appreciate the cat psyche!"" --Allie Babcock* *(Note: The fictional Ms. Babcock is a dog behaviorist and the main character in a mystery series created by Leslie O'Kane, which includes the books, Play Dead and Ruff Way To Go.)"
4,Running a clean cat house.,"Finally, a book that acknowledges and addresses the most common of all cat problems, especially in multiple-feline households: Tabitha's (and Sylvester's and Eliot's) ""uncivilized"" avoidance of the litter box. The author addresses both physical and psychological problems (both the cats' and owners') and gives much helpful advice (put tin foil over the scene of the crime, spray it with citrus scents, put Cleopatra's food dish close by (since's she's far too civilized to want her dining table next to the ""men's room""), and address Morris' attacks of anxiety with generous doses of reassuring countermeasures.Admittedly, much of the information I had sort of intuited. But this is no novelty book about problems that to cat lovers are no laughing matter. It's both eminently readable and practical. I only wish I'd had a copy earlier to give to a friend who brought his adorable little stray to the pound when she began soiling his carpet."
3,Cats on the counter?? Give 'em a treat! or a cat condo,"Cats on the Counter takes a serious approach to Cat Therapy. There are many topics discussed here that many a cat owner will want to read about and find how these 'cat psychologists' helped fix problematic or 'bad behaviour' of many a house cat.If you never owned a cat before this book would be very insightful, but not as an end-all to any confusion or problem you are having with your cat. If you ARE a long-time cat owner, there are just a few gems here and after quickly reading the book you may set it down and decide like I did, that you really didn't find any amazing revelations...Or you may decide that you've become paranoid with worry over something they say in the book which is quite normal behavior for a cat and they just don't seem to get that across.Read it? Yes. Believe it all?? No."
4,One Song I DO Know,"hey fans-heres one song that is missing-when brandy and joe go off alone right before they meet brandys dad on the side of the road, the song that is playing that has the heavy guitar riff in the beginning is ""Eddie Money - I Think I'm In Love"". the best way to see what songs are missing is to watch the end credits-line up what is already on this sndtrk and what isn't when u see all the songs that are used. peace"
3,Good soundtrack,"good overall soundtrack with a few songs that could have been replaced. for the guy who was wondering what song was playing when joe was in the house while it was being fumigated, it was 3 Dog Night's ""shambala"". enjoy."
4,"Good, but what is this song?","This soundtrack has some good tunes, with Lynyrd Skynyrd, Roller, Blue Oyster Cult, and Eddie Money. But, there is one song in the movie that i am wondering what it is. It is the song that is playing in the background of the scene when Joe is working at the oil rig. Anyone who knows, i would appreciate the response."
4,Great Music Names In This New Movie Soundtrack,"This brand new soundtrack from the new comedy movie ""Joe Dirt"" features some of the music greats, including: Lynyrd Skynyrd, Ted Nugent, George Thorogood and the Destroyers, Doobie Brothers, Joe Walsh, Cheap Trick, and more. You'll enjoy the hits in this CD, such as Sweet Home Alabama, Walk On Water, Who Do You Love, and more. Ted Nugent's Cat Scratch Fever is featured on this CD as a bonus track not in the film. Recommended."
4,good rock songs,"I loved this movie more than I thought I would. I think they should have included a few more songs from the movie on the soundtrack. The song when Joe and Brandy are playing around with the dog is also Eddie Money and it's called, ""I think I'm in Love""."
4,Good Rock--But Missing Seger!!,"Aww man...this could have been a great soundtrack, but unfortunately it is missing probably the greatest song from the movie...""Rambin' Gamblin' Man"", by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band. But, other than this glaring ommission, it does have some great rock tunes! But this one, but also go and buy Seger's ""Greatest Hits""!"
4,Another forgotten favorite,"Just like other reviews have stated, they missed a few good songs out of this soundtrack. One song I notice was The Doobie Brothers' ""Listen to the Music."" This song was playing in the beginning when Joe tells about how he became friends with Brandy and Charlie, and they're dancing by the barn door. It's weird since they put in ""China Grove."""
3,PRETTY GOOD CD EXCEPT IT MISSES A FEW TRACKS,"OVERALL I LIKED THIS CD, IT HAS ALOT OF GREAT CLASSIC TUNES, BUT IT'S ONLY FLAW IS THAT IT DIDNT INCLUDE EVERY SONG IN THE MOVIE. THE REAL REASON I BOUGHT THIS CD WAS FOR CHEAP TRICK'S "" IF YOU WANT MY LOVE"" AND FOR 38 SPECIAL "" HOLD ON LOOSLEY"" AND SHERIFF'S ""WHEN I'M WITH YOU"". AND I WAS PISSED CUZ IT DIDNT HAVE THAT 38 SPECIAL SONG. I WISHED I COULD HAVE NOTICED THAT EALIER BUT THERE WAS A STICKER BLOCKING THE SONGS LISTED, SO I ASSUMED IT WAS ON THIS CD. BUT I NOTICE A FEW OTHER TRACKS MISSING LIKE BOB SEGER AND LEAF GARRETT. I THOUGHT IT WAS KINDA ODD THAT THEY WOULDNT BE INCLUDED BECAUSE THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF ROOM TO FIT THEM ON THE ALBUM. BUT I GUESS IF YOU CAN DEAL WITH THOSE MISSING TRACKS THEN GO FOR IT, IF NOT THEN LOOK ELSE WHERE."
4,The song when Joe and Brandy become friends in the barn,"As an addition to the previous review, the song that is being played when Joe and Brandi become friends in the barn is called ""listen to the Music"" by the Doobie Brothers. It's an awesome song (my favorite from the movie), and took me a while to find... enjoy!!"
4,Very useful,"I've used these kinds of stacking trays for many years now. I appreciated when they came in a large choice of colors. But since they no longer do, I usually get the smoky one, since it sort of blends in with whatever colors are in an office. They are attractive and handy.I would like to see this product and others like it have a longer tab/slot so that the trays did not come apart as easily as they do should they be jarred. Also a larger tab for labels would be an improvement in the design. Other than that, they work well for us."
3,Good,You get what you pay for. Functional. Works fine. Smoky grey is a good choice for blending into a background. One arrived broken but was quickly taken care of with a replacement.
4,another,i liked this book good story and keeps you guessing. i love to read but it has to be a good book to keep me reading and this one is great
1,blech,"I almost never put down a book without picking it back up. most good books, I have trouble just putting them down. this one, I stopped halfway through. I dunno, I just didn't like it. the book just didn't feel put together very well. the romance scenes seemed forced, and didn't really seem to fit. mostly, the characters weren't very believable, incredibly one-dimensional. the book was just plain awkward. maybe I'd feel differently if I finished it, but I just can't. It's too painful."
2,Okay - but don't expect much...,"I bought my DAV2100 because I didn't have the cash to buy a better system. The old addage that you get what you pay for definitely applies here. Software is okay, but not dazzling. Performance is nominal, but some newer DVDs (with SS 5.1) may have playback problems - sound plays, but video freezes. After about a year or so, the thing starts breaking down - front panel display flickers, sound cutout, disc drawer freeze. I was impressed by the construction - all metal chasis and good ventilation. An average system for people who don't have the buck to buy a topline system. But uh... were I to do this again, I'd save up the bucks and buy the top line. - tally ho! (HP)"
1,"Cheap, but still a waste of money","This is an affordable beginner system, but in less than a year I have had several problems with it. After watching only a few DVDs, the video output has stopped functioning. I can hear the the DVDs' sound, but can't see the picture. (I would try the S-Video output to see if it still worked, but my TV has no S-Video connection.) I also noticed that the audio output for the central speaker has stopped working, which ruins the surrround sound effect.So if you want an entertainment system that delivers no video and incomplete audio within a year of purchasing it, this is the product for you. Otherwise, you should spend a little more and get a reputable brand."
5,BEST SYSTEM FOR ME!!!!,"I think this is the best system. It has many features,has am/fm tuner + you can change volume of subwoofer.I think it even is supposed to play VCD & much more!! I use this system as a reciever for all my game systems, I definently HIGHLY RECOMMEND this system to anyone who wants a digital 5.1 dolby digital surround sound system. It is now out of stock, I would pick one of these up before there gone. when they were available retail was $269.99 & that was on sale, I'm very happy with mine!!!"
5,Pretty close to 6500k,"I'm using this for a completely different purpose than its intended usage -- I'm using this for a bias light for an HDTV. I did a rough check of the color temperature by taking a picture of the light with a DSLR set to 6500k for the white balance, and it's pretty close. It's a bit cool, but close enough for the price!"
5,"Really bright, plants love it.","Really bright white light and all of my plants I have are growing towards the light. Only thing I notice , and this may not even be the light , is a slight white haze in my water. This may be the algae in the water that is also benefiting from the light or it could just be my water. Good bulb for a good price."
1,BoRiNg,"I got this book from the library and i could barley read 5 pages. I lost interest very early on. Since i played the game first, i though it would be similar. the charcters didnt even have the same name. i was bored to tears. i dont recommend this book at all!!!!!!!!1"
4,"For authenticity, go with another recording","This 'pastiche' performance of Montezuma was recorded in 1993, when it was believed that most of Vivaldi's music for the opera had been lost and that the printed libretto was all to go by. However, in 2002 almost the full score was rediscovered. While it still gets filled out with a bit of pasticherie to cover some missing chunks, some substantially more accurate recordings are now in existance."
5,Great GPS navigation tool,"I use it to find our sites for work. Cheap GPS and a cord, and it will track you to a marked location. It does have some slight kinks in the software, but overall great."
3,Great fun but broken already,"My son loves this toy. He took it out with his friends in 40 degree weather to play. As noted, the balls are fragile and 2 of 4 have already broken. I guess I'll buy some whiffle balls. The cheap foam bases and the markers remain unused, but the markers are of similar quality to those used in football practice (marking the end zone etc.). They may be of considerable use in games other than junk ball. The list of games they refer to is nothing you can't make up yourself. I had to give it 3 stars due to the balls breaking, otherwise 5.Also, unless I'm missing something, this is a better deal than:Official Junk Bat & Ball Set"
1,Not healthy for hummingbirds!!,"This product is potentially dangerous for hummingbirds because it contains Red Dye and one or more preservatives. Even though hummingbirds might guzzle it down, that doesn't mean it is healthy for them. (I myself love all kinds of things that aren't healthy!) You do not need red dye in the nectar to attract hummingbirds. Most feeders have enough red on them to do that job. A simple mix of 4 parts water to 1 part sugar (don't use honey or sugar substitutes) is what is healthy for hummingbirds. Cook it, cool it and put in a bottle in the fridge and you've got the same convenience without the dangers of this product!"
5,Sweet & Soft,the essence of this of this fragrance is soft and sweet. It is a very nice fragrance. I would recommend this to any girl that wants a light sent not one that is sharp and bold.
5,"I agree, bring this back in print!","I read then reread this book so many times back in my younger days, and I wish I had a copy of it again. Really amazing stream of consciousness writing."
4,Don't have e-Lighters engrave it.,"Bought it from e-lighters. Good lighter, but save your money on the engraving. I had them do two for me, and the engraving has pretty much worn off in a few months, just from simple pocket wear-they didn't engrave it very deeply."
1,DWL-810+ WEP does not work with Netgear WAP,"After hours on the phone with ""level 1"" and ""level 2"" support (none of which spoke English as their first language), upgrading and downgrading firmware, going over and over the setup with every new person I talked to, I was told that I could either just use the 810+ without WEP or return it to get my money back. It didn't seem to matter that my DLink DWL-520 card worked fine with the Netgear with the same WEP settings, as did an Orinoco card; they said they ""weren't sure it was a problem with the 810, or if a firmware update will ever be available to address it"". Guess I'll be getting my money back, rather than running my WAP without any security."
1,Owned one momentarily. Glad it's gone.,"Out of box, it required a firmware upgrade to be configured with any browser other than Internet Explorer. Not a pleasant start.After configuration, caused packet chorusing on my 802.11b ad-hoc network. Ping it, get 1, 2 or 10 packets returned. Not good.And the connection losses... let it idle for awhile, and the connection dropped, requiring power cycle to restore operation.Buy the Linksys WET11 instead. I returned the D-Link, bought the Linksys, and left the problems behind."
3,An unusual book,"The Fourth Treasure is a novel with strong elements of Japanese writing and neuroscience. If you are interested in either, or both, you should read it. However, unfortunately, while the storyline is interesting, the book has serious flaws in characterization. Most of the characters don't really come alive - they are flat."
4,Sturdy and durable,"I was looking for some thin angled flipper, and purchased this one. It is a very durable and sturdy tool. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is not as thin as I would like making it a little bit more difficult to get it under the food I'm trying to remove from the pan. Overall, a great gadget if you are not looking for a thinner type tool."
1,Completely broken digital sale and distribution model = no sale for you.,"This looks like an amazing book, but I'll never read it until the price for the Kindle version is fixed. Over $30 for a digital license to access the text, compared to just a few bucks more for a permanent physical copy of the book that can be lent, re-sold, and is property that the user actually owns instead of a mere license to access digital version of the content. On top of this, a publisher-mandated limit to the number of devices that license can be used on? For shame!"
4,Nice Primer,"I think its a great first book for anyone wanting to know more technical details about the workings of the CD, digital audio in general, digital interfaces and some DSP.What I like most about this book was it was easy to read and simple to understand, unlike some other books that are just plain cryptic."
5,"The ""bible"" of Digital Audio","Mr. Pohlmann's book is the most encompassing treatise on Digital Audio that is available today. As an employee at Dolby, I can tell you that you won't find an engineer at Dolby who does not own a copy of Digital Audio. The book can be used in many different ways. Whether you are an expert or a novice, this book will come in handy. I would equate this book to drinking directly from the source of a mountain spring. Don't think about it, just buy it."
2,Poor. Choppy read. (4th ed),"I was really disappointed with this book. I am an EE and have some background in a few of the topics, and have always hoped to become a proffessional audio engineer. I was hoping this book would get me revved up. It did not. I don't know about previous editions, but I get the feeling the chapters have been through too much cut and paste - there is little consistency between subsections. Subjects are either glossed over superficially, or driven into the ground with over-emphasis on details. On another note, I got a (mint condition) used paperback. It was bound very poorly and started to fall apart by chapter 2."
2,Full of facts but lacks personal insight,"The author does a thorough job of listing every single song Cash ever worote and where the inspiration came from. However there is little insight into Cash's personal life, his divorce, his first years with June. It was almost as if it was written by an outside observer rather than a personal, close friend of his. I found myself skipping, skimming through the last several chapters. Sadly, a disappointment."
3,Too clean,"I was looking for a story of redemption, it's in here but not to the depths or details that I had hoped. In the end I wasn't even sure if I liked the image of what I read."
5,The essence of Johnny Cash,"Steve Turner has done an extraordinary job of capturing the essence of Johnny Cash...his spirit, his words, his brutal honesty, his wry humor, his self-effacing humility, his stalwart determination, his artistry, his sensitivity, his stubbornness, his righteousness, his sinfulness...his living contradictions. The book often feels as if Johnny himself wrote it, except that Turner is able to provide a certain level of objectivity and perspective...and praise...that Johnny himself could not have done. At times, the book is so unflinchingly honest that the reader may be tempted to turn away...but believe me, you won't...you can't. There are many stories in this book that are heartbreaking, moving, and inspiring, just like Johnny himself was. Many books and articles have been written about ""The Man in Black,"" but Steve Turner has given us something more--a document of Johnny's soul. It ain't always pretty, but it's for dang sure a beautiful thing."
5,GET IT !!!,"I read this after I read the autobiography 'Cash' and found this to be much more complete and comprehensive! A truely engaging read, it is well researched and well written! Just get it and you'll know what I mean!"
4,Had me Fooled,"When the book came in the mail, I was afraid it was written from a religious perspective and might try to downplay Cash's wild life and focus too much on his ""spiritual journey."" I was relieved that it didn't. I will say that Cash's first marriage and divorce probably deserved more coverage, but the author did a fine job overall and Kristofferson's preface was well written and insightful. First half of the book is basically the movie ""I Walk The Line,"" but with added material. The lifelong love affair with June covers that romance quite well. For the amazon.com bargain price, I'd say this is definitely worth adding to your library."
1,Battery hog,This camera is a complete waste of money. We have not been able to shoot off one role of film before the battery goes dead. We have gone through three batteries already on only 2 1/2 rolls of film! At over $6 each this is a crock! Don't waste your money.
4,dispite what others think...,"For the Price, you really can't beat the quility. I love mine, However, I'm still looking to buy a Nikon N65 Just so I can have more freedom when I'm taking pictures. outside of the restrictions brought on by a Compact camea, I've no real complaints with it. As A side Note, anyone worried about Batteries, I bought the E-2s by Energizer, And I've not had any trouble with them, or Durcell. remember, spending alittle more on Good batteries makes a difference."
5,A Helpful and Civil Discussion,"I grew up and am still a member within the Church of Christ (a capella) branch of the Stone-Campbell movement. I found the book to be very thoughtful and engaging without being too scholarly or too polemic. The ""evangelical response"" chapters were nice reminders that theology is most profitably done in community. I imagine the book may not catch the interest of those outside the Stone-Campbell heritage, though I believe the book would be an excellent source of information for anyone wanting to know more about the claims and characteristics of this branch of the evangelical family."
2,"ok on facts, light on sense","The medical aspects are dealt with fairly accessibly, but troubles me is the author's tone throughout the book - patronising, and his tendency to make statements that belie an extraordinary ignorance of human beings. What kind of weirdo would write a sentence like ""....of course, the death of a child is always tragic, even when it is expected""?There are a few such pronouncements in the book, but the whole thing is saturated with that strange arrogance that only doctors seem to manage - I think it comes from dealing so much with ""the sick"" and ""suffering"" family members, that they start thinking that doctors are some higher breed of ""healthy"" humans who are on earth to offer hope to poor unfortunates.I would not recommend this book for parents."
2,What is a chaplain's purpose?,"This was interesting, but I find it odd that Chaplain Pickett considered his stated, pre-execution duty to the man who cold-bloodedly poisoned his own son for insurance money, was to comfort him. I would have thought he would attempt to bring him to the point of admitting his heinous crime, and finding absolution--before entering eternity in a few hours."
1,Disappointing and Dull,I don't think that I have ever read a more boring and dull book. The author after spending years observing people die on death row and being employed as a chaplan in the Texas criminal system now says he does not believe in capital punishment. I find what the author has to say at times hard to believe and as I was going through the book my interest just fell off the map. There are few insights here that could not be gleaned from old newspaper articles and the like and question I had in mind mid way through the book was why did buy this disappointing and dull volume.
1,Goolish Fare,"When I purchased this book I expected truth in advertising. What I got was a goolish account of death row. The book is depressing and dark and I was feeling that way while reading it. I could not finish the entire book. I guess I should buy books that speak about life in a positive way, instead of those that have no life in them."
5,Very thought-provoking,"If you had asked me 6 months ago how I felt about the death penalty, I would have said I was in favor of it. I still believe there are crimes which are so heinous that the death penalty should be used. However, I am troubled that there seems to be no uniform criteria which dictate when it is used. Also, I think we need to ask ourselves whether taking a life, to avenge a life, is truly the answer. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been troubled with how violent crime is punished in America today."
5,love love love these,"First of all, I cannot stand using tampons (the actual application) but I cannot give up wearing thongs when I'm at work in dress pants...These are the only alternative available to me (they work too) and they discontinued it!!! Now, I have to order them online..."
5,"Goodness Gracious, Who took away my thong pads??","First of all thank you Stayfree for making such a wonderful item, secondly Amazon for continuing to carry them. I am one of those short women with hips a plenty and i would never go back to panty lines on all of this ever again........This was/is the best product,and since i couldnt find the stayfree brand i tried others and they all suck. Free at last, free at last....Thank God almighty i have Stayfree Thong Pads at last"
1,Doesn't live up to the brand,"Wow, was I ever disappointed in the quality of this product combo. The only item of the three I thought was good was the gloves. The other two items were very lightweight and not worth the price. This is a highly regarded brand and these items certainly did not live up the brand's reputation."
4,Not a perfect fit but...,"I have 2009 Honda Odyssey Minivan and I tried on back seat of 1st, 2nd and 3rd rows.Although I can make them fit on all rows, I didn't quite like the way they fit into any of rows.Those clip-on straps on top fitted okay. I wish they made more strings on bottom as well as little longer so that I can attached little better but you can make it work if you're little bit creative.It has plenty of pockets for my two babies."
5,Awesome for organizing the back seat,"We drive a Honda CRV. I love having the extra space as opposed to a closed trunk. But I hate all the junk that is inevitably rolling around in the back. This fit the back area of the CRV perfectly (once we reattached the headrests, which had been removed for infant seats), and the various compartments are already full and doing their job. I'll admit there's still a bit of junk rolling around back there, but that's because I have a bit of a messy streak!"
5,Must have,"I love this for my back seat. I drive a suburban and this was perfect for the back seat. It holds everything, I love it so much i bought one for my mother too."
4,good product just a bit small,"I bought it for my boyfriend cuz his SUV trunk space is just a MESS and this seems like a good deal. Anyways, it fits in the Lexus 350 (i think). But the pockets are a little smaller than I thought but honestly it can't be any bigger cuz otherwise the thing won't be hanging from the seat rest but laying down on your trunk. So imagine one pocket for one pair of golf shoes only or go and take a look on your trunk to ""picture"" it. While I am sort of complaining, it still does a wonderful job of organizing his stuff! it's a good thing to get!"
4,This is a very nice product.,This is a very nice product. I couldn't use it for my truck because I have a cover for my trunk. But would buy it agian if I needed to.
5,Disregard all negative views here...,"X-3 combines two excellent Acquaviva & Hawtin efforts! Although I am a much bigger Hawtin fan, the Acquaviva set is the better of the two with a relentless barrage of sweet beats and smooth transitions. Both DJs pull some of the finest material from label mates (inc. Speedy J), and do justice to virtually all inclusions. Seek and ye shall thank!"
3,"didn't use it much, returned it","We didn't use it much in class, though I suppose the exercises were challenging. I returned it because it just didn't add up cost vs. worth. Glad I did."
2,Not mandatory reading,"I have purchased three other Tillman books & they all follow similar format. Tiny bit of detail regarding history & development, a lot of what pilot shot down how many enemy planes on what day. Gives a good flavor for the heroism & valour, the courage of these vets, but it does get dry & redundant after awhile. Few photos, all black & white.In summary, a good book, nice to have on the bookshelf, but not one you'll be re-reading over and over...unless, of course you are tired of counting sheep..."
3,Bought for my husband,My husband seemed to enjoy this book because he does a lot of reading about WWII and knows a lot about aircraft.
4,Cheesy but funny,"I honestly ordered this movie to get free shipping on an item that was a few dollars off from the $25 free shipping - it still turned out to be a better deal that way...although the movie was pretty cheesy, it still had me laughing. I really wasn't expecting much, but I was presently surprised."
3,Good sound,I liked the way this home theather systems works together with a Sony TV I just bought! Easy to put it together.
4,A HOT SYSTEM,"Being a SONY fan, I was happy to see this system at a price I could afford. There is plenty of speaker wire, so placement of speakers is not a problem. The sound is great, and the AM/FM stereo capability is a nice added feature as is the ability to play CD's. What does bother me is the amount of heat generated by the unit. Playing a 2 disk movie, such as Harry Potter, got the unit smoking hot. I had to install it on a sliding tray and leave the door open on my entertainment system just to keep it cool. In fact I'm considering the installation of a cooling fan at the back of the equipment rack. Other than the heat, it seems to be a great deal."
2,Not a Quality Product,"I got this system a couple of months ago and already I've had numerous problems. First, the DVD drawer occasionally gets stuck and sometimes will not work at all. I have to reset the system to get it to work. Even then it will only be good for a few more opens and closes before it jams up again.Second, it will not play some DVDs. It will start them, but once it gets to the main menu, it says ""Program play of title # (we&#65533;ve seen 4, 10, 20, 33, etc.) prohibited now"" and stops the disc. I've found a way to get around this on some DVDs, but it still creates great frustration, which is the opposite of what I want when I watch a movie.Quite frankly I would expect higher quality than this from Sony. I am going to take this system in to have it looked at, but I am regretting getting it in the first place.However, I should say that when the system is working the sound is great! Hence, the reason for two stars instead of one."
4,Works great with some complications,"I really like the system, expecially when I play HD into my DLP projector. I just had a problem with some DVDs not being playable, getting the message ""program play of title xx prohibited"" (where ""xx"" is some track on the DVD). What a pain! I don't know where the problem came from, but I think it may have been my kids pushing buttons on the remote. To restore playing capability, all I had to do was turn off the ""Repeat"" mode by hitting the ""CLEAR"" button on the remote."
4,Great System/Great Sound,This was a gift to my 23 year old son who is an electronics lover and music addict. He loves the sound this system has for his CD's but especially loves the great surround sound for his movie collection. This system arrived in 4 days from ordering in two layers of heavy plastic wrapping in excellant condition. This is my best on line order to date! Great System with Great Sound !!
1,OK...for a while,"I've had this system for about 15 months and it worked great until the last month. Now it won't play my DVD's. In perusing other peoples' reviews, poor longevity and quality seems to be a problem with these Dream Systems. I'd stay away."
1,DVD function sucks,"I bought this system about 2 years ago and within an year it had problems with DVD playback. By tweaking it, I could make it work for a while but it stopped working altogether. Luckily I was still in the warranty time period and the repair shop fixed it fine. But now, I am having issues again with the DVD function. The tuner and other inputs work just fine, though. The DVD tray won't open. There's one CD inside and I can't get it out or get it to play. And since I am not in the warranty period, I am not motivated to get it repaired either. I guess I will just use it as a sound system and buy a DVD player separately. I am not impressed with SONY this time. Looks like many other users have/had similar issues with this ""dream"" system."
2,Great for about 12.5 months,"There is a reason that the warranty is only one year long. I bought this system last Christmas and I thought it was fantastic, until last week (Feb. 10) exactly 12.5 months later. It will not play any DVDs. I get a no disc error and it will not play. I've tried everything and I'm not quite sure yet what to do. I think it is convenient that Sony doesn't sell this system anymore. STAY AWAY!!!"
3,Broken,"I have had this system for about 4 or 5 years. And last weekend the DVD player malfunctioned. I rented a DVD, and it was stuck inside the unit, so we had to disect the thing to get the DVD out. It basically seems like it fell off the track....but it wouldnt eject any of the dvd's in the player, nor would it play them....It didn't get extreme use. Maybe 3 dvd's per week? Not the kind of quality I was hoping for from Sony. I am not sure if we will be repairing it at all...."
2,Not worth it,"I purchased this product back in 2003 and it was fine at first. After about a year, I had some problems playing DVD's where it would start up, go to the main menu and then just stop and move on to the next disc. Sony tech support was no help, but I did find a soloution by randomly hitting buttons, trying everything and anything I could think of to make the system work again - I believe it was some sort of a region problem/setting on the unit that I somehow corrected.Then, a couple of months later, I was unable to hear sound through any of the aux ports or radio. All sony can say is to send it in for service. My father in law bought a much cheaper panasonic home theatre system about 6 months before I got mine and his has never had any issues and sounds just as good."
1,Technical Product with Poor Documentation,"The Polar S625X Heart Rate Monitor is no doubt a technical marvel for serious racers and their coaches. It has many training and record-keeping capabilities that can be shared with your coach.That's not me. I like to run and bike for exercise and keep records of how I do. This unit is way too complicated for me and the documentation is soooo bad that I got to page 60 before I figured out how to run with my time and heart rate displayed. I still can't get a reasonable record of the distances I run, my heart rate or the temperature and altitude.If you are training for the Olympics and your team has a good technical support person, buy it. Otherwise, save $150 and get something cheaper.If your training"
3,If it only worked as promised,"I've been using Polar 625x for over a year now. It could be such a great tool for monitoring exercise if only there was a reliable connections between the transimitter and the monitor. Often in the middle of the exercise I will notice abnormal readings (too high or no readings at all) that come back to normal in a few minutes or so. There does not seem to be any outside interference. Cleaning the straps of the transmitter does not help, nor do new batteries. Tech support was not of much help either. The problem has become so annoying that I am investing in a different heart monitor."
1,Polar s625x does not compare to the 725 in any way!!,"I traded up (according to Polar Support) to the S625X. I wore the S725i out and wanted to replace the perfect cycling watch with the perfect running and cycling watch. The 725 worked flawlessly for the most part, with no worries and no problems until the battery died and the watch simply wore out after about 3.5 or 4 years. The 625 simply put, never works. I have finally gotten it to record cycling data, so I will not change any settings. Forget about downloading data, it will not download the data to the Polar software - at all, ever. I contact Polar support and to my surprise, they were of no help. Basically, they told me it does not work. This product must be the one bad egg. But, I will think before I purchase another Polar product. On a positive note, it does keep the time and the alarms work well and I still ware it."
2,Mediocre at best,I have owned my S625X for about 18 months and still struggle with the confusing menus. I have a degree in IT yet the Polar user interface still baffles me! This unit has many design floors such as not being able to delete training files when the memory is full without connecting to your computer - not very convenient if you are not in the same place as your PC! Interference from power lines and the like is a big problem too and the software is again poorly designed and difficult to understand. I'm pretty disappointed with this product overall.
4,Still ticking!,"I bought this unit from a different website... but this is a very very well made and amazing piece of equipment. 5 years almost daily use... works well in hot or cold weather. wireless speed sensor for 2 bikes! I wish the software worked for MAC, i have to use someone's PC to download... 99 hours of data in the setting i use! calories, hr max, speed, distance, hr avg, ect. running pod is nice, but i kinda think this is a better cycling/x training tool... foot pod for running is small (think: garage door opener), but not tiny. all in all a great extravagance that i do not regret and i think has paid for itself many times over."
3,A couple of things to keep in mind while running,"The running option on this is a bit inaccurate. Keep in mind when you are calibrating this thing on a track, it says ""if you are a walker, calibrate it while walking, not running"". Now I see why.I was doing track intervals to test its accuracy, and it was a lot less accurate at higher speeds than while calibrating it at a 8 min/mile pace. Over a course of a 6 mile run, that in accuracy adds up.Bottom line on the running option: If you are high tempo runner, calibrate it at a higher tempo. If you are walker, calibrate it accordingly.The cycling function of it works great (same as the 725 that i'm replacing it with).The New software is the same, just looks different. (if I'm wrong, please tell me)."
2,Overpriced & User Hostile,"This watch is very complicated to program and the user manual provides the absolute minimum of guidance. In other words, you are on your own as far as programming this watch for your individual exercise needs. You will have to waste a lot of time on every aspect of this watch from setup to regular usage. Even downloading data to the computer is a hit or miss challenge which works as often as it doesn't. Also, this watch is very inconvenient for everyday usage b/c it has too many parts. It's much more convenient to have a gps watch which eliminates the foot pod and leaves only the heart rate device as the one xtra thing u have to remember to put on. Additionally, it's insanely overpriced for such an old and obsolete model. In fact, it costs more now than when I bought it years ago. Yes, years ago, that's how long this model has been out. Lastly, I wish I could have my $ back!!!!"
1,"Not 3""","This item is okay if you only want to take your laptop(mine is a 17"" Apple powerbook) and not your cord!! Its more like 2.4 inches thick not 3. Amazon charged me to ship this item back because they claim it's not thier fault that it is NOT 3"". I normally love Amazon, but I lost money on this deal. A fella must have wrote this description as it is not 3"" on any ruler in my house. I did get the 4"" model of this case from Vanguard and love it. I would have ordered it in the first place if I had known."
3,GOOD BOOK ;BUT NOT AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS,"I LIKED THE BOYFRIEND MESS BUT IT WASN'T AS GOOD AS IT LOOKED WHEN I BOUGHT IT.THE PREFACE TO THE BOFRIEND MESS,THE BOYFRIEND GAME,IS MUCH BETTER. THE BOYFRIEND MESS HAD IT'S GOOD POINTS THOUGH,MOSTLY THE END,BUT OTHER PARTS WERE SORT OF LAME."
3,Wides are narrow.,A decent shoe but the EEE is narrow in the toe box. Feels like a D (medium) width. The sole makes it look wide but the shoe narrows. You might like the shoe if you have narrow feet.
5,Asking questions,Probably the best book of its kind available for biology students with no statistical background. Starts with the conversion of informal questions into testable hypotheses and then shows how a variety of basic statistical techniques can be used to test hypotheses. Then gives sensible advice on presenting the results.
5,I love this mustard,My favorite is the stout. Its a thick and decently seedy spicy brown mustard. I probably wont get the 3 pack again but the other 2 are good too.
5,Great documentary,"This was very educational and it wasn't boring to my 13 year old, we both enjoyed it and watched it together."
1,The product picture is not the same item as the item description and SKU,"The Amazon picture on this items is not correct and does not match the description and SKU number. If you are buying this item based on the picture, be aware that the product you will receive will not be what you see in the picture. The description and SKU number are for another GE bulb and not the one pictured."
3,Nice Sci-Fi Fantasy,"Even though I'm more of a Sci-Fi person than Sci-Fi Fantasy, Crossworlds was a nice entertaining film that kept me going without taking a break. Even though the plot was basically about a young man trying to develop into a real man, the show had it's interesting moments filled with action. I like the movie, and I will watch it again one day.Thomas"
4,Enjoyable,"I bought two sci-fi movies at the same time...this one and Velocity Trap. I have to say, I enjoyed Crossworlds far more than the other."
3,Sadly disapointing,"As a Rutger Hauer fan, I find myself wondering why he did some movies. In this film he is the only big star. The other actors are nobodies (to me) and the script left a lot of holes and was really not very good. Regardless, this was watchable but disapointing."
5,Great movie!,"Had a lot of fun with this movie! It's a bit your generic sci-fi funfest, but I can still enjoy it!"
2,strange movie,"un curieux film que j avais eut l occasion de voir pendant un de mes passages au usa a la tele , c est un nanard de la plus belle eau , un de ces films bizarre sur les mondes paraleles, mais pas ininterssant , une bonne idee , une realisation assez moyenne mais surtout une tres mauvaise edition , le pressage du film est une catastrophe mais je ne regrette pas de l avoir acheter pour la presence de rutger hauerun strange movie with a good pitch on paralele worlds but in france this movies are called nanard a mix of bad realisation and good idea, a another probleme with this disc its a very bad edition , images are blured and not sharp for details but its not a bad movie"
2,Good idea - disappointingly badly executed,"I bought the DVD on the basis of the reviews herein. Unfortunately, the nice idea was spoiled by poor execution. The fights have the worst telegraphed and pulled punches I have seen, and the plot is full of holes you could drive a very large thing through. I think I understood why the central character was involved, but lost the plot when the prize (the staff and the crystal) were lost but the fighting still carried on. This wasn't helped by the loss of lipsynch about 2/3rds of the way through on my Sony 725. My first mistake on DVD"
2,Could've been better,Could be confusing at times and definitely needed better writers. Not a movie i recommend at all. Too bad because they had a good storyline and good actors.
2,What a waste of celluloid,"I thought this movie was terrible. Low-budget is no excuse for a poor script and acting. I can't believe they got Rutger Hauer to be in this turkey, must have spent the whole budget on his salary."
2,Low Budget,"The plot and its development are extremely weak. Acting is marginal and special effects are questionable. What can I say, I love SciFi, have a thing about time travel flicks and enjoy punishing myself with B rated SciFi movies. If you're looking for quality entertainment, then this is not the choice for you. If you're a nut about SciFi, go for it Bro."
3,Nice little mind teaser,"This low budget movie isnt the greatest thing you'll ever see but it was quite intriguing as a story and well executed. The actors are all well cast and its a pity it didnt have the budget to make it more complete and visible -or to use it as the start of a series as mentioned elsewhere. If you like interesting stories, or sci-f, this is one that can stretch your mind a bit for the evening. It's good to see different dimensions, rather than different planets and worlds, used for exploration. Pleased I bought it."
4,An Interesting Sci-Fi Fantasy,"I too was drawn to the movie by the Rutger Hauer name, this was like reassurance that the movie would not be bad and could be good. I was not disappointed in that regard, the movie was entertaining, not too heavy on the clichés, and also had some interesting ideas.The movie was more family friendly than some and was light on violence; it reminded me of one of the Disney action flicks produced for general audience.The movie held my attention all the way to the end and had a satisfactory ending that wrapped everything up nicely as a PG-13 film should.Although this film is not really outstanding, it is good; considering it's family friendly I can recommend it for a family environment."
3,"A bit cheesy, but not bad","Interesting movie, definitely not on the top of my list (or I'm guessing anyone else over 12), but a decent watch and it has Rutger Hauer!"
3,cabelas african safari,"The game is fun to play.glad I bought it.Although ,I would like to see a improved african safari come out.Activision could have done better with this title."
1,Little better than a road map.,"This book's content could be summed up in the phrase, hit the road. A California road atlas will provide most of the information offered in this book. The coastal trails, when present, parallel the Pacific Coast Highway, however, most of the ""hiking"" is walking on roads. Perhaps, the State of California will further develop a ""Coastal Range"" sojourn that would be detailed in a book such as this. Walking highways is not hiking."
3,just an outline,This is a good outline for a unit study. If you are looking for a book with lots of sugestions for activites and such this is not it.
4,"Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Jalapeno",Not bad as jerky goes. Jalapeno adds just the right amount of bite and does not overpower the flavor of the beef. I would give this product 4 stars
4,Jalapeno Jack Link's Jerky,"This product is very good and tasty. I had to search many local markets before I could find it with Amazon. I recommend it highly.The only problem is for those with high blood pressure and heart disease, for the salt content can push the blood pressure up.For young people who like a tingle in their tongues, this will satisfy."
1,Caution!,"I bought this instead of an upgrade for my old Omnipage, because of the reviews I read here. Bad mistake! It comes with an odd-ball install program that incorporates both a floppy disk and a CD. It was impossible to install the program from the floppy disk, because the floppy-disk install program crashed my system every time I tried. The manufacturer did not respond to my email request for assistance.It was possible to install from the CD, but that installation is for a trial period only, after which the program presumably goes dormant until you re-purchase it.I returned the software for a refund of my purchase price."
2,Poor Installation methodology,"I have owned this product for a number of years and it ran well on Windows 98se. I just recently upgraded to Windows 2000 on a PC that does not have a floppy drive. It is not possible to reinstall this software without a floppy drive. Copying the floppy to another media using a machine with a floppy does not work. It appears you must use a native A: drive. The subst command also does not work.There is no longer any tech support of any kind provided for this release. The newer releases also appear to require the use of an A: drive floppy, so upgrading will not solve the problem."
1,Absolutely Fabulous,"ABBYY FIneReader 5.0 Home Edition is an exceptionally valuable, high quality product a very affordable price. This program is as accurate as any other I have tried, costing far more. It is as easy to use as any other OCR software package out there, and is just as accurate. When considering the price is below ...[undisclosed dollar amount], you cannot go wrong with this product. I quit using TextBridge and Omni Page after trying this product. Those other programs cost three to five times more, and provide no greater productivity. Best ...[undisclosed dollar amount]I have never spent on software."
4,Great OCR Software,"Compared to the American-produced products I have seen in the past, this is a major step forward. Very high accuracy in a wide range of languages. My only beefs are two: that it would be nice to have a feature to help to deal with double-sided pages fed through an automatic document feeder, and, that it would be nice to be able to output directly to WordPerfect and maybe some dtp programs. Otherwise, hard to see how it could get much better."
3,Generic Item,"I purchased this roof rack set for a 2006 Ford Escape. I just want to point out that this is a generic roof rack and although it will fit a 2006 Ford Escape, it is not made for a Ford Escape or any particular type of vehicle for that matter. In addition, the description and the documentation included state that it is an easy installation. I don't not consider drilling holes in the top of my vehicle easy. These do not fit on the Ford OEM pre-installed rails on the Escape. I will say the product seemed to be sturdy enough to warrant a 3 star which I consider average, but I would not recommend it unless you are comfortable drilling holes in the roof of your vehicle."
5,Best mustard ever?,"OK, I'm not a mustard connoisseur, but I had this with some soft pretzels at an Oktoberfest celebration and I liked it so much that I had to buy some for myself. The mustard has a really nice texture with pieces of mustard seed. The problem now is my inability to find soft pretzels for sale within 50 miles of my location. So in the meantime I've been mixing it with mac & cheese."
1,Awful,"This mustard is horrible. There is an inverse correlation between the absurdly inflated price of this shameful mustard and its quality. It has a nauseating garlic taste and absolutely no mustard flavor (the quintessential turmeric taste, which is the recognizable taste of mustard, does not even register, for example). Essentially, the manufacturers made sure this mustard LOOKED impressive by trumping up a stone-ground appearance. This is how they hook the customer into paying the inflated price. The value of the mustard ends with the appearance, though. We found it so disgusting that we threw it in the trash. Shameful."
1,FLAVORED WITH PETROCHEMICALS,This is our culture in a nutshell: a stone ground premium mustard made with the finest ingredients and then adulterated with artificial flavor enhancers and preservatives NONE OF WHICH ARE NEEDED OR IMPROVE THE MUSTARD.
1,Bad ingredients in this mustard,"Inglehoffer mustard contains sodium benzoate, EDTA, high fructose corn syrup and sodium metabisulphite. These ingredients are known to cause allergic reactions (sodium benzoate), asthma attacks and severe wheezing (metabisulphite), reproductive problems in lab animals (EDTA) and contribute to weight gain (corn syrup)."
2,Don't hate me....,"I'm a HUGE Paul Carrack fan and have almost all of his solo albums as well as all of his group stuff (ACE, Squeeze, Mike and the Mechanics). While he has one of the best voices in the business and is an incredible songwriter, these covers just don't cut it for me. The arrangements are uninspired and he actually souonds bored singing them. I kept listening to this, hoping to hear someone I was missing in earlier plays, but nadda."
4,Paul is altogether SOULFUL!,"I am a Paul Carrack fan, love his music and soulful voice! This CD is great and worth having with bonus cuts AND a DVD. My favorites: Harvest for the World, Sunny, Into the Mystic, It's Growing, Wish it would Rain. He adds nice touches and vocal interpretations to these classic songs. Some background vocals are a little ""faint"" but still good. Great song choices!"
1,Awful,"The book is very poorly written. It seems as if the author wrote two pages of plot and added another 250 pages of repetitive, pointless and meaningless descriptions. Reading the book was like clipping really hard finger nails. I can't describe the book as anything else but hard. By hard I do not mean difficult, because there are works which can be difficult yet beautiful. By hard I mean lifeless and annoying."
2,"If you like long, drawn-out descriptions of everything under the sun, this is your book","The Pagoda, like almost any book, has something to offer, but in my opinion it's not much. It seemed as though the author's main goal with this book was to describe every object or situation to the thousandth degree, so that absolutely no word was left unused, and this got old fast. I don't think there's one page in this book which doesn't have an unnecessary description about this, that, or the other. In all, the actual story of this book was probably no more than 30 pages, if that, while the rest of the pages were filled with (mostly) needless details, the purpose for which seemed to be the author's desire to wow readers with her extraordinary ability to describe any given thing/situation to death.On the positive side, the book does offer some interesting information/perspectives on gender, class, and race issues during 19th-century (colonized) Jamaica. I just wish there had been more of that and less ""filler."""
2,An Exercise In Futility,"Being Jamaican,the idea of this novel about Chinese indentured workers fascinated me,and the look at village life held my interest,but the novel itself was so badly edited,wordy with no reason,and the characters Low the main one, so cold I could not warm to this mishmash novel,the minor characters were thrown in it seems to add interest,but their presence was not worth the long read either.This is truly not representative of Jamaica,the characters seemed created for shock value,and as for thefalsemustache,please give me the name of the glue that kept it on for so long in the smoldering heat. Give us a break."
1,This book is one of the worst I have read!,"This book was just plain awful. The writing was repetitive and the book was difficult to understand. There was also too much flowery prose - the constant description drew away from the potentially interesting plot. Furthermore, the main character was not likeable to me. He was selfish, self-absorbed and did not have a desire to connect with others. He was too withdrawn into his own pain and whined too much. Though his life was a hard one - it certainly wasn't as hard as those of his Chinese compatriots who labored on the tobacco plantations. His constant philosophying and dissatisfaction greatly irritated me. Also, Lowe takes credit for the pagoda which others built. He actually does not do anything of use throughout the book. I do not recommend that this book be read by others."
3,5 stars for content 1 star for SACD,"It is indeed exactly like the stereo cd version.Where is the surround channels? Nowhere.....I turned all front speakers off; checked player>says 5.1 sacd, and yet there is nothing coming out of the surround speakers.If Sony wanted to toot the SACD format, this WOULDN'T be the disc to show off the format.What a FREEKIN' rip Off. Sony: SHAMEON YOU.I hope my other ""New"" SACD discs play in multichannel. AGAINSONY: SHAME ON YOU!!!!!"
2,Stereo SACD version sounds poor...,"I was disappointed - great music, poor sound. Just stereo version, bad quality. If you like classic rock, better buy QUEEN ""A Night At The Opera"", DEEP PURPLE ""Machine Head"" and PINK FLOYD ""The Dark Side Of The Moon"". Great and powerful 5.1 sound!!(...)"
2,It's just stereo,"It's foolish to make an stereo version if you already have the multitrack sessions to make the 5.1 version.Is it a matter of money, time, I can't understand,it's a full waste of resources.Buy the DTS version, you won't be dissapointed."
3,Sounds Like The CD,"I had the CD, and thought that the SACD would be incredible, but alas, I've A/B's them and damn if I can tell the difference, and my equipment is quite good.Be forwarned, if you do have the CD version, don't buy this SACD. You already have what you'd be paying extra for."
3,"5 star album, 1 star for going back to digital PCM master","I have this SACD and the CD. I believe they went back to the 24 bit PCM master rather than to the original analog tapes. The other SACDs and DVD-Audio discs I own absolutely blow the CD and vinyl versions out of the water. This SACD sounds identical to the regular CD.This is probably Santana's best album, and one of my 10 favorite rock albums. The music is 5 star all the way. It was an album which altered the path and perception of rock music. It, and the public, deserve better. Buy the CD, save the extra 5 to 10 bucks and be happy until it is done properly."
5,Great follow-up to How Many Bugs in a Box?,"My sister, math genius and teacher, got the first game for my oldest son when he was two. He loved it and began teaching it to his brother when he five and his brother was two. They enjoyed playing the game together and now that my youngest is three as much as he likes the original he need some new games to keep his interest.This game also has the same fun bug characters who make silly sounds and wacky faces. It has different games that are new and keep my toddler's interest. Great follow-up game with a lot more fun and learning."
4,Alaska Aviation,"An excellent account of aircraft disasters in the ""Last Frontier"". The author tells the complete story of each accident in layman's terms, from the beginning through the post accident investigation, drawing the reader into the horror of each tragedy. There are many interesting facts on the background of the aircraft and crews, as well as the factual data from government transcripts and search and rescue information. I highly recommend this book. It should be read by every pilot as a source of what can and will often go wrong in aviation."
2,"too simple, unorganized...","This dvd doesn't seem to be well organized with nothing more than simple instructions and no extra play along beats or lessons. It's like watching a low budget VHS video. The instructor just plays his guitar and show off his skills. It is difficult to follow along because he doesn't give you the time to practice. There's absolutely no pause between lessons. Get ready to pause the dvd throughout the lesson. If you look carefully, you can notice that he is out of breath and excessively sweating. That's how fast he moves through the lesson. This is a typical, low budget guitar instruction. This is also not made in 2006, but rather 2005. I suggest ""the Fender Presents: getting started on Acoustic guitar"". Fender took their time making their 300 min dvd. ""Guitar Lessons:.."" is a okay video.. But are you kidding me? I can't believe these companies don't take their time making their dvds. I've wasted my money and time with this dvd. Thank goodness for Fender!"
5,A journey to a Land far away.,"Come traveller and sit by the fire and make us, old fools with timeless tales, company. You ought to be tired from your long journey through the misty mountains, don't you? You should be, my friend! Now rest and gain forces, for tomorrow will be a hard day. But never sleep unarmed! You never know what beast might crawl out of the dark forest and attack you.This is just one small piece of what the real essence behind Mortiis is. This album, is simply fantastic, not only will you be entranced by the atmosphere it creates, but you will make your imagination fly. And if you are already an imaginative individual, (such as myself) your imagination won't fly, but your whole essence will be transported there.Truly an epic."
4,Think....Lord Of The Rings!,"Good concept album about elves, dragons, trolls, the end of the world...the age of fire....the cloak and dagger, etc., . It's fun, it's dark, and it's weird. And now it's remastered. Mortiis's The Stargate is essential Mortiis."
5,Ambient metal,"Mortiis develops an aspect of dark music rarely found in other ambient bands. The mix of keyboards with dark sound effects makes Stargate a unique piece of fine art, very pleasant to listen."
3,It was OK--but not great.,Arrived with a knick on the top corner of the book because the packaging had not been heavy enough to totally protect it.
2,A little more metal. PLEASE,"Not made with enough metal on the table and fence portions, it flexes too much. Had I to do it over I would not own this hunk of metal that is not standing in the corner."
3,From a concert in 1974,"Made in USA in 2001, Serial# KBL2-3530, Playing Time 37:29This 7-track disc is almost identical to the ""King Biscuit Flower Hour"" release. All that's missing is the 30-minute interview with Randy Bachman.Recorded during the ""BTO 2"" tour in Chicago sometime in March 1974, the album contains live versions of ""Let It Ride"", ""Give It Time"", ""Roll On Down The Highway"", ""Welcome Home"", ""Takin' Care Of Business"" and ""Slow Down Boogie"". Just as on the KBFH, track 7 is in fact recorded during a Randy Bachman concert in 1993 at Bob's Garage in North Bend, Washington, and is only otherwise available on the promo-only EP ""Plugged In"".The energy is good, and the musicianship is, well, typical BTO. An affordable substitute to the KBFH, if you don't already own that..."
2,A failure,"This is the first book by Billy Collins that I have read, and so I must admit that my opinion may be relatively uninformed, although I think it is safe enough to assume that this is a fair representation of his work thus far. It seems to me that Collins' preoccupation with accessibility has overpowered his poetry, if indeed the contents of this book can be said to be poems at all, rather than cut-up prose. Dullness is the recurring characteristic of the collection, and the famous Collins charm wears thin very quickly. The value of poetry lies in how something is said, rather than what is said, and Sailing Alone Around the Room does not provide that value."
2,Just Not My Cuppa Tea...,"I just don't enjoy Collins. His work is very bland for my taste. It has a cutesy kind of charm that wears itself out fairly quickly. Nothing profound or earth-shattering or even thought provoking. Of course I would assume that to be crowned poet laureate, one's work would have to be conventional and non-controversial to the degree that it would be acceptable for the mass market. It is obvious that is what Collins was striving for. In my opinion this work is totally uninspired. I think I would rather read Ginsberg."
4,"Strong, Strong, Strong","Billy Collins is on fire. 'The Rival Poet' is a great poem full of splendid wit. Looking at 'Victoria's Secret', you can see why this man has the gift he has. He is a monster of a writer with wit that has you running down to the local bar so you can try and drop it on your friends. Very cutting edge. Very entertaining."
5,"Wise, witty and graceful poetry","I adore Billy Collins. He has a unique voice, a way of putting things that is very pleasing. His poetry shows humor, wit, and intelligence, not to mention talent. I have never cared for ""epic"" poetry, and many poems leave me mildly disappointed because they seem to be trying too hard or are hard to relate to personally for me. However, Collins' poems seem to flow naturally with one's stream of conciousness. His work has rekindled my interest in this art form."
3,I don't get it,"I have been reading poetry all my life. I have a great deal of memorized poetry within myself. I too write poetry.From what I have read of Billy Collins I do not sense myself really reading poetry. Perhaps the best term for it is 'light verse'. It is clear, based on ordinary life situations, often wry, mildly humorous. Compare it for a moment to another poetry of ' simple vocabulary and everyday life' that of Wordsworth, and see how lacking it is in depth, sublimity, real beauty.In any case I am not writing to deny the right of others to enjoy the work, or even claim that it is the greatest poetry they ever read.For me , it simply isn't."
5,Told in the simple things,"More and more I appreciate the poem that brings poetry down to the familiar, even the mundane. A cup of coffee and a cigarette, or the way leaves look just before a storm. Billy Collins is a master of this kind of simplicity. He grounds you firmly in the world, and then lets the truth of it open out before you. Accessible though never simplistic, direct and dryly funny, Collins is a gem. Read him."
3,"Fine poems, too few new ones.","I enjoy Billy Collins' poems, but I do not feel this book is worthwhile if you already own his earlier books. His books are all pretty recent and in print. There are no obscure gems unearthed. To spend the cost of a hardcover on merely 20 new poems seems a lot. I would have just preferred a full new collection. A retrospective would be more appropriate in another decade or two."
1,E-Z READING,"This is contemporary poetry in its most dumbed-down form. Collins expects little from his readers, and apparently expects little from himself. Accepted on its own terms, this is okay stuff--agreeable the way a sitcom can be agreeable when your mind is too tired to engage something beautifully complex."
5,Plato and The Platapus Walk Into a Bar,Very funny. A great way to learn about philosphy while having a good time. Fun to read while on a road trip.
5,Entertainment or profound?,"This book contains two sections: 'selected poems' and 'twenty new poems'.His poems are like tiny odd stories. Amusing but all of a sudden ants climb up the desk of the poet (""winter syntax'). There are always those small surprises we don't fully understand (most of the time). Like 'Insomnia' (one of the new poems). A person can't sleep because someone is riding a tricycle inside of him.What is the bottom line? I'm under the impression that Mr. Collins is an entertainer. But he will not make it easy on us; there are too many surprises. We try to understand them and sometimes we do. But no matter what, his tiny stories take a hold on us and we have to like them even when we don't want to."
4,Good book of poetry,"This has some really good poems in it, but IMO it is not Billy Collins's best work. It's still a nice read though."
4,Wonderful,"Billy Collins is so human, so wonderful. What more is there to say.He is really so accessable, and great for new poetry lovers."
5,Selected Poems,These are selected poems from several of his previous books plus some new ones (at the time of writing). Billy Collins is consistently entertaining. Personally I just like the fact that I don't have to have a dictionary handy to enjoy his works as I did reading Rilke.
1,waste of my money,If you are not an IT person you will need help setting up .Using D-Link customer service is a chore due to language issues .I bought the video phone to contact my son in Taiwan and it never would connect ==D-Link HELP LINE ?? ==could not understand why and were of no help what so ever .I could reach the test location but that was it .=Complete waste of money !!!
1,Do Not Buy The DVC-1100!,"I have to admit, the main reason I purchased (2) of these DVC-1100's was because of the stellar reviews posted here on Amazon. I bought one for my in-laws and on for my wife and I so that they could watch our children grow up over long distance. Great idea, bad solution. The main problem I had was that the camera lens is fixed, and does NOT focus. I waited 1 hour on the line with D-LINK tech support only to learn that the lenses on these cameras are designed to be fixed and only focus when you are approximately 6 - 8 feet away from the camera. Unfortunately, the ones I got did not focus at all, and the video quality was absolutely terrible (washed out color and bad contrast). Please listen to me, save your money and do not buy the DVC-1100. This device is cheaply made, and just not there yet..."
3,WARNING: does not work with AOL Broadband!,"What D-Link does not tell you is that this device will not work if your ISP is AOL, because AOL constantly changes your IP, and the I2eye does not address this. Also, as you know if you're on AOL, when you connect, you also sign-in to AOL, and again, the I2eye does not have ""sign-in"" software on board. We spent three hours on the phone with D-Link, AOL and Verizon, and there is NO work-around. Also, if you call D-Link, they will claim that they support ""all ISPs"" but when you tell them how AOL constantly reassigns IPs, they admit that they don't address this. Bottom line: you can't use this with AOL broadband."
1,Dlync Video phone 1000,"Setting this unit up has been impossible, and I have not been able to use it. I have sought help of Dlync website, dlynk phone support. The have not been able to work me through it. I have paid for a machine I cannot use, have spent countless hours on phone and computer in trying to set it up. Another person who has the same system with which I wanted to communicate has had the same problem and cannot use hers."
5,Excelent price and product,Fast shipping and works well. I was well pleases especially since we couldnt find one locally.
2,Glad it was cheap,"Nothing in the book held my interest.I'm just glad it was cheap, but it was still not worth the $4 paid for a used copy. There are much better craft and re-purposing ideas available free online.The photos are nicely done, which is good because the written instructions are confusing.The author relies much too much on hot glue, a lot more than on actual sewing, which the title would lead one to believe."
3,disappointing,"this book has some great ideas, if you can 'go outside the box'I have trouble with glueing things together, they don't seemto last. and I like to have it until I find I don't want itanymore. I was taught to not follow a pattern exactly but as aguide.if you can use it as a guide, it's great.if not gofind another book. like I told my kids you are only limited byyour imagination."
3,What to do with old jeans,"*NOTE!* not a book for an experienced sewer!!But fun ideas for my ten year old and myself.Directions are not clear, but I'm a visual person. I can make these by just looking at photos.Also inspired more projects and ideas.Fun book, if you can get it at a reasonable price."
5,Synonym/antonym: Socialism and Democracy,"We are so conditioned to the fix put on the left by the Leninist tradition that we forget the crucial role of the left in the 'forging of democracy' as recounted in this history in a 'slow but steady' account that accumulates telling detail. Once there were liberals who weren't democrats and then the left, in the wake of the failures of 1848, proceeded to the course corrections we now take for granted, no thanks to the liberals who weren't democrats, now democrats, by name at least, denouncing socialism by a Leninist standard where the term was a demand for real democracy."
1,an expensive door stop,"Eley is one of the more prominent radical leftists at a radical left university so you should not expect much balance in his writing. But I did try to get through this book with an open mind and must say that about half of the book has some interesting historical events in it. The problem is that most of these events are shaded and slanted in such a way as to make this book useless to anyone who has studied history and historical movements. Eley is a classic radical who really has no appreciation for competing thoughts or ideas other than his leftist view of the world. The fact that the Soviet Union kind of falls off a cliff in the book when its obvious failures killed this evil philosophy and economic system is most telling. But he will continue to write this kind of drivel, pounding nonsense into the kids in his classrooms, and make a lot of money from hard working taxpayers for doing so."
1,bad quality print,"its a print of a canvas painting and it looks blurry, it also has the signature of the artists in one corner."
1,"Noisy, cheap fan","The fan started making a rickety noise after only a few days of use. Very disappointing as I expected better quality from Honeywell. Even without the dysfunctional fan, this a relatively loud unit compared to ultra mist and heat/steam units."
1,"Works as advertised, BUT.....",The BUT is the filter for this humidifier. The filter needed to be replaced after two weeks of 24/7 use. The filters cost almost $8 each to replace. That makes using this humidifier during the dry winter season a very expensive proposition.
3,"Great humidifier, but awkward to fill","All in all, I like this humidifier. It is quiet and puts a lot of moisture in the air. During the winter months, I would always wake up with dry mouth, but once I bought this, that stopped. However, it is very awkward to fill. It holds 3 gallons, which makes it heavy to hold under the faucet. The top comes to a point, so you can't put it down in the sink to fill. Once filled, you have to try to balance it on the point so that you can screw the lid on. Then when you put it right side up to take to the base, you can be sure of alot of dripping along the way. It would be so much better if you could fill it from the top."
1,perhaps I bought the lemon,"I purchased this humidifier last winter and was very disappointed. It basically lasted the one winter and was quite noisy. Also, the warranty wasn't worth the paper it was written on."
3,Don't forget to get a Protec Cleaning Cartridge,"The Protec Cleaning Cartridge that the item description boasts about is not included, even though this model has a special holder specifically for the cartridge. A little heads-up would have been nice."
1,poor quality,Worked great until they stopped working. Bought two units for use in our office. Both units failed I'm just over a year. Failed within 2 months of one another. I'd try something different.
3,Hard to fill,"The problem with this product is that it is difficult to fill. There is no flat spot for it to sit on, no way to balance it, and no handle to hold onto while it fills. It's a good machine, but if you use it everyday and have to fill it at least once a day, it can get tedious."
4,keeps air moist,Works great for an inexpensive model without the whitsle and bells. The tank is a litle smaller than our old model but it fits more compact on the table. It is also very quite.
3,Not quiet,"It is not quiet, even in the sleep mode. I can't fall asleep while it is on. The rest is fine."
2,Not as described.,"This is supposed to be quiet. No where near quiet for me. And it is supposed to have a 3 gallon tank. Perhaps it is one gallon, but not more. So disappointing."
2,It is noisy,"It is really noisy, about at least 39dbs, How could people use it while sleeping? I would like I have bought a cool mist one."
2,3 strikes,Perhaps I misread the advertisements but it does not shut off when empty. A big negative in my book. Also the water container doesn't stand up when being filled - so it takes 2 hands - one for support and the other to put the top back on (which seems to leak if I'm not very careful about replacing it). An older Honeywell 500 series model has none of these problem. It isn't particularly quiet in my opinion. So while I'd probably buy another Honeywell I would not buy this one.
3,Humidifier,"Unfortunately I returned this before using as I'd intended to order a similar humidifier that doesn't need expensive filters that have to be replaced often. Return was processed very efficiently, as usual for Amazon."
1,Poor Dehumidifier,"I purchased this unit, then found the humidity control is not accurate. Returned the humidifier to Amazon, at the advise of the manufacturer. They sent mea replacement only to find it had the same problem. The box for that one was thrown out by mistake, so I can not return it. I am not happy at all. I own three other humidifiers, by a different manufacturer which I have had no problems with."
4,Great Buy.,Took away one star because the tank is smaller than expected and needs to be filled more often but other than that I love the product. Pumps out moisture but is surprisingly quiet. Would definitely recommend it.
2,Beware of the tank,"This humidifier performs as expected. A major downside is the removable tank that needs to be filled twice per day. There is NO easy way to do it. I fill it in the bath tub which is OK, but the challenge is balancing a 15 pound vessel full of water with no way to stand it up to put the lid back on. I'm tempted to design a stand for it. During one filling instance it fell and sustained a small crack in the housing. I fixed this with epoxy. Who ever designed the tank obviously never had to fill it!Would recommend this product to coordinated people only. If you are a fumble fingers you won't like it."
4,honeywell humidifier,"It's a good purchase for the price. I don't find it particularly quiet, but it is efficient."
2,There are better humidifiers,"The tank is smaller than similarly sized humidifiers, and the cap to the tank leaks, so you have to be careful turning over the tank when filling and replacing it. It does put a good amount of water in the air, and all three of the speeds are fairly quiet."
3,it is just OK,"I'm sure this is a very good humidifier, but it is 3 parts. The base, fan and tank. If you are not careful when picking this up it will fall apart and you will have water everywhere."
4,Great humidifier,"Low noise factor, holds water for close to 24 hours, and turns off automatically when water is out. What more can you ask for? I live in phx, az in the dry heat and this humidifier has been great so far. I bought one for baby's room and one for my room."
4,very good buy,"very quiet, no problem sleeping with it on, given it is on the night quiet setting, living in a desert climate with pretty much no humidity, it helped my dry itchy eyes in the morning tremendously. Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is to refill the tank with more water you need a lot of strength in your hands to open the tank, since you have to break the vacuum seal, that is been created while in use. Small weaker hands might have a problem with this."
2,Short product life,"I purchased this humidifier last year. After only 1 year of use, the water tank developed a crack along the bottom seam. When I contacted the manufacturer regarding a warranty claim, I was told that after 1 year's use, it was considered a normal wear and tear issue not covered by the product's 5 year warranty! To purchase a replacement tank, the cost would be $20 + $6.95 s/h. Obviously, not worth it. Just go out and buy an entirely new unit. Otherwise, it's a good little humidifier - just realize that it's lifespan probably isn't more than one year!"
1,Do Not Waste your Hard Earned Money!,"Everything about this humidifier is wrong! No auto shut off when it is out of water, no way to set tank down when filling the tank and the curved design makes it very difficult to hold, fan does not shut off when removing fan section for refilling, OEM filter is too tall for fan unit causing it to be ill fitting and rattle all the time.....need I say more!!! We have another Honeywell humidifier, HMC -1100, that we have had for several years and it works perfectly fine and had a previous unit that this one replaced that worked fine for years....but this one is a dud!!!"
1,Not even 2.0 gallon moisture at all,"It advertises if it can contain 3.0 gallon(that one of the reason I bought it).But, It's not."
1,One terrible piece of equipment,"What a very poor excuse for a humidifier. It is very noisy even on low fan speed. The air is very cold and damp that comes out of it. I literally hate this piece of junk. I thought I was ordering a warm mist unit like the ones I have had in the past from Honeywell, which were fantastic. What a big waste of money, nothing but aggrivation. I feel like throwing this junk away. Now I have to spend more money trying to find what I thought I was buying. SHAME ON AMAZON FOR MISREPRESENTATION OF THIS UNIT AND NOT SELLING THE BEST ONES THAT HONEYWELL MAKES."
1,It stop working after two weeks,I only get to use only for two weeks. It is no longer working anymore. i don't know what happen to it. i changed water everyday and i only use it for 3 hours a day. It just stop working. The fan do not work and the mist not coming out either.
4,humidifier,"this humi, is good i returned 3 before i purchased this, very quiet, has an automatic on/off setting, doesn't make things wet, sets a cool air to a room. Only negative thing i could say is that you have to fill it upside down, cumbersome but the good outweighs the bad"
5,"Terrific humidifier, especially for the price",We've just had a horrible spell of very low humidity. This machine got me through it in comfort. I'm amazed that it works so well for a relatively low price.
3,Quiet but need to refill the tank quite often,This humidifier works well. It's very quiet but we need to refill the tank at least once or twice a day and the filter needs to be changed almost every month (and it's $12).
2,Too noise,My wife and I bought this humidifier for my son (about 10 months at that time). Actually we do NOT like it at all because the following reasons: bulky dimension (2) very noisy (3) it needs to regularly replace the filter.
1,WAY too loud,"Even on the lowest setting this humidifier is extremely noisy. I can hear it in the whole house. The water tank is hard to fill because the top (which becomes the surface it sits on during filling) is curved, so you can't just set it in the sink to fill it - you have to hold it. What I do like about it is that you don't see the mist coming out. I know it's working because the water level is going down. Despite this, it's just way too loud, so it's going back to the store."
1,Let's be honest,"I've had three of these, and I still wonder why. Easy to turn on and set, impossibly hard to fill. This is a piece of industrial design that is so poor, it should be sold with a warning. The handle is in exactly the wrong place, there is no flat spot to rest the reservoir on while you screw the top on...YOU WILL GET WET...who thought of this design?? This is without question the most poorly designed product I have ever purchased on Amazon."
2,ran it twice,"Our kids are in an average-sized room, not that large, and the water didn't last all night. When we woke up, the room and upper floor of the house smelled like burnt oil. I'm sure it wasn't helping our lungs any, esp the kids in the same room. 2 nights, same result, time to return. We are trying an ultrasonic model now. Also not as quiet as advertised, at least by our/kids' standards. Finally, after reading reviews of motors going bad, seemed like we were on our way to a similar experience."
4,Works well and runs quietly,"This model is very quiet and will put a lot of moisture into the air, especially if you keep the filter moist by frequent turning and replace it when it hardens and becomes less absorbent."
4,Works as advertised,"It has been about a month since I got this and it's working fine so far. The only issue I have is that the screw-cap on the bottom of the tank doesn't seal shut quite as well as it should, so it tends to drip a bit when carrying the tank from the sink to the humidifier. The filter starts getting discolored quite fast and needs regular up-keep, but I understand this to be a common issue among most humidifiers. The unit is quiet enough to sleep with it on without really noticing that it's running. It can easily handle the approx. 500 sq. ft. area that I use it in and uses up an entire tankful of water overnight.Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this humidifier. Recommended."
3,it works,"I'm not convinced on the name ""Qiuet Care"". I have this unit in my bedroom and I think it's too noisy to run while I'm trying to sleep. Also, the adjustable humidity gauge doesn't seem to be too accurate. That being said, the unit does work just fine and puts humidity into the air which is why I bought it. I don't have anything to compare it to, but I would like to think somewhere out there, someone makes a higher quality humidifier."
2,Rated #9 in Dehumidifiers,"I have a very similar model, and it doesn't put out much moisture. It works by wicking water up into a filter that is probably 36 square inches of exposure. The tank doesn't hold a lot of water and is designed so when you're filling it, you have to balance it in the sink instead of having a surface that could just sit upright.A cheap fan completes the poor design and operation of this unit.Maybe that's why it's rated so highly as a 'dehumidifier'."
4,Great Product Hard to Replace,"I have used this humidifier everyday for the last 3 months with great success. Maintenence is a breeze. My only complaint is that the water resevoir is not easily replaced. My husband dropped ours after filling and it broke. After searching online, I called Honeywell, they have a resevoir from another model that could be used but the cost was same as the entire unit. I bought a new unit since you get a new filter too--but I hate the idea of waste."
5,big toy box,"I bought this for my grandson. It is big. The top is removable. However, the rim has velcro to help hold it on. The top has a little shelf--good for extra toys or puzzles. Small children will have a hard time reaching to the bottom of this toy chest. And the door can be hard for littles one. Overall, I like this item very much. It is simple, sturdy and very practical."
1,Speedway Storage Chest - No way,Purchased the bed that correlates with the chest and almost bought the dresser as well. The Storage chest is a glorified plastic storage bin and I am very unhappy with the price I paid. Not the seller's fault as the product sells 68-and up on the market. My husband almost flipped when he found out what I paid for it. I am very glad I did not purchase the dresser which is over 100. The bed that goes with the set is great but I was NOT a smart shopper when I purchased this. It is as tall as my 3 year old. He enjoys it as he climbs in and out and it is like a clubhouse to him. But to us it is just a glorified storage bin with a fancy lid.
4,I love this toy box!,"This toy box can hold many toys because of the canopy-like top. I really like it. The only draw back and the reason it only got 4 stars, is that my son takes the door off. I don't know what they could do to fix that but I still recommend this one. It holds much more than the other toy boxes on the market and it is fairly cheap. Oh yeah! They have a matching Step 2 dresser/tool chest and race car bed. The best thing about the bed is that it takes a toddler mattress and then a twin mattress when your child is ready for it. I couldn't find any other car beds that took both size mattresses. Also, It is alot cheaper than the other car beds. I haven't put my son's car bed together yet but we have purchased it and we are waiting until he is 2 to put it in his room."
2,Not what I expected!,"I thought with the price of this item that it would be a lot more durable. I like the size of the toy box, but it seems to be made out of flimsy plastic. The totes you buy at Walmart or Dollar General are more sturdy than this. I guess I'm paying for the brand and color of the toy box. Not at at what I expected."
4,Good for large toys,Works well for large toys. Lid comes off easy & door comes out easy which isn't wonderful when your 2 year old figures it out but overall works well.
4,Bamboo Stick Sword,"If you ever seen the movie ""White Dragon"" with Cecilia Cheung and Francis Ng you may want to order this unique sword. Upon first glance you will think that it is a walking stick. But as hidden weapons go it easily converts to a sword by pulling the end off and now you have two defensive weapons instead of one. The sword has a nice point and is not sharp for legal reason. But as with any sword with a good edge anything is possible if you are willing to put in the time to clean it up.I like this sword because it fits into my unusual Chinese sword collection. If you like Japanese swords, this will also fit into your collection. The sword has a modern-day edging which is similar to that of a Ninjitsu Shirasaya sword."
3,"Good disguise, not much else",The blade is straight and has a sharp point. The rest of the blade will need a lot of sharpening. The handle is too large and the sword came out too easily. Tip the butt of the sword down and the sword slides right out.
4,Very Comfortable,"I bought this boot since it was on sale and I needed a new boot for next season. Well, I had to wear them to a wedding this past month and I really like them. The heel is low enough that I was dancing all nite. I really like the back zip....it is actually kind of sexy and I was getting compliments all nite on them.The reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is that I am not a larger woman at all, 5ft 10 and 140 pounds....and these boots were tight on my calves. Once I got into the and strecthed them out a bit they were fine."
4,lovely sound against all the noise,"i brought this CD with me when i went to thailand for 5 months. obviously it got a lot of play around the house. the songs are laid back, but there of moments of sparks and energy in the beats and guitar that set you up in your chair. i found it a brilliant relief from all the noisy bands that blare from the radio and cars. definitly not shoe-gazing stuff though. the lyrics have that poetic complexity of love lost and gained, telling stories that leave you room to imagine the parts of the story unspoken. reminds me of beatles, dylan and modern sounds. quite nice that there is a consistancy in the sound, you aren't nocked in the head by a hard rock track after a mellow ballad. all of the tracks would make it to my iPod (if i had one). Graphics are quite interesting. quite happy i got this disc."
1,didnt work,"It Kinda worked when I first got it, butonce in a while would disconnect. I madesure no other devices were interfering.I then turned on WEP, and it also intiallyworked, but then it really started getting flakey,disconnecting every couple minutes.I felt the top of the unit, it was hot enoughto cook an egg.Even after I disabled WEP it did not work any better.I eventually replaced the unit with a netgear 802.11gunit and wow, so much better.I did have a rev B unit, maybe they fixed thingsfor the rev C unit.I actually used this unit without the wireless portfor several months and it worked great. Just never workedright on the wireless port, when I got my laptop."
1,the worst piece of junk i've ever purchased,DO NOT buy this router. I've installed this in my home and the range is literally 15 feet. Anything beyond 15 feet and the signal comes in and out. It's so bad that I've had this warrantee replaced. Problem is that the replacement is just as bad as the original.An extra long cable for $20 is a better buy than this router.
3,Mediocre performace: IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION TIP,"I purchased this router because the price was right. I should have stayed with my gut and got a Linksys -- I had connection problems right off the bat. Only one PC would connect at all, and it dropped its connection every few minutes (Using the DWL-650 PC Card).I finally found an obscure post on a forum for APPLE users, which hinted about a preamble setting in the performance section of the config utility -- SET THIS TO LONG (Short is the default). Connection dropping went from a matter of minutes to a matter of hours and both laptops were able to connect. I was unable to find information on this matter ANYWHERE on D-Link's site.Overall, I got what I paid for. The DI-514 works marginally well, considering I got it for around $30. Still, I wish I'd spent the money for a Linksys."
3,Serious wireless security hole,"The router works great for me, but I have an important warning: Do NOT disable the wireless feature. I discovered that checking the 'disable' button in the wireless setup page actually leaves the wireless fully operational BUT WITH NO ENCRYPTION. It broadcasts an SSID of 'GeorgeAP22' -- apparently some leftover test mode.So, set up the wireless encryption, and leave it enabled, even if you have no current need for it. Otherwise, your network is there for everyone to see.Tech support told me it's a known problem that will be fixed in a firmware upgrade. After two months, still nothing on their website. I have firmware version 2.00."
1,Call customer service before you buy any DLINK product,"I called customer service for this product, press 1 for sells, press 2 for product info, press 3 for tech. Any number you press, you get the same answer: contact the web site support.dlink.com. Well, as I expected this web site is invalid or inaccesible. Good Luck with Dlink products."
2,Terrible product,"I bought the DI-514 because I wanted to have a wi-fi router and it was only $20. What a mistake. First, if WEP (encryption) is turned on, wi-fi simply does not work. I've tested this with three laptops and two Pocket PCs. Wi-fi does work with WEP turned off, but it's painfully slow, and keeps dropping the connection.Second, the router's firewall cannot be configured, even though the documentation says so and there's an area in the ""advanced"" configuration that supposedly lets you set specific firewall rules. No luck. I set the rules and tried everything, but the firewall was still blocking my applications. Very frustrating. The website support is just terrible, with lots of errors in their knowledge database.I'll never buy anything from D-Link again. My previous router (a Microsoft) was easy to set up and worked like a charm. I shouldn't have given it to my dad... should have just bought another one."
1,Time sucker AVOID this cheap router,"Spent hour and hours and hours trying to get this thing to be reliable. It works, doesn't work, it works, it doesn't work. Reset, reboot. It worked for a day then stops.Absolute crap. My guess is that I got a bad one. Seems there a lot of bad ones out there."
3,go more,"First let me say. set up was easy and the router works well, but fork up some extra dough and please get the ""g"" version. Man Im topped at 11Mbps normally keeps me around 5.5Mbps. This is really slow. You can run a wire and get the norm stregth, but I will be returning this item and the card cause I need more power Scotty. I want to run at 100Mbps.. can't wait for the new modem and card"
1,very unreliable,"When my computer was idle but connected, the router would disconnect for a few seconds and then reconnect about once an hour. When web-surfing, sometimes it would disconnect/reconnect several times within one minute!!! I got really annoyed at it and returned it. I'm going with Linksys instead, which I've had better experience with."
2,"Good basics, poor features","This router works great out of the box as long as you stick with the default settings.I'm using it with a D-link DWL-700AP to bridge two networks. Using the default settings, everything is great, but when I tried turning on the 64-bit encryption, the two units stopped talking to each other. I called tech support and they said that the encryption simply did not work on the DI-514. I then tried turning on the MAC address filtering, and the router's set-up utility just froze after I entered my computer's MAC address.Just remember - YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. On the plus side, the tech support guys are helpful once you get through to them."
1,Avoid this router.,This product has so many bad reviews that I'm surprised they're still selling it. The router drops the signal every 1 or 2 minutes. Wireless doesn't work if you want to use WEP. Don't waste your time and money in this item. I got much better results with the LynkSys G wireless router.
2,wireless newby,I bought the DI cause it was best price.Was able to get wireless connection but unable to get internet access.D-Link support was helpful. did not wait long the 2nd time i call ed but had to hang up first time cause i could not wait longer. Support was helpful but at end of 15 min they said the unit was defective and to send it back and get new one. So that's what i am doing now. If it works when i get the new unit then i would up this review to 3 or 4 but given it hasnt worked yet ....
3,somewhat working,"When it is working, it is working. Easy to setup, easy to use. However, sometime it just ""dead"": although it seems to be working from the leds, you can not access the internet. You have to restart. When I say restart, I am refering to pull out the plug and push back in. Till now I haven't figure out the reason. This will happen inperiodically. Sometimes it works for two months, sometimes you have to reset everyday or even twice a day."
2,A so so router,"Well, I kinda agree with the bad reviews: my experience is that it basically works BUT: every so often (say every week) ""forgets"" the configuration, which means I have to wire the computer to reload the config.NTP (automatic time setting) does not work, the date jumps back and forth randomly between 1956 and 2030.Static assignment of DHCP addresses in the LAN also is unreliable, i.e. it gets ""forgotten"" as well, so that if you open a port for ssh to one address but then the address changes you are screwed.The built-in dynamic DNS update system does not work (you need a software client on one of the computers to do the same thing).I use 64 bit WEP encryption without problems.Performance is reasonable.In summary: I bought and so I try to make the best out of it, but I wouldn't buy and I do not recommend (quite strongly actually)."
3,Used to drop connections CONSTANTLY -- now fixed!,"I've owned this product for about six months, and a while back, I gave it a poor review. The main problem was dropped connections: I'd get dropped about 5 to 15 times per hour. Intolerable!Well, for those having this problem, visit DLink's website and upgrade the firmware. Apparently, there is a compatibility problem with some laptops. Once I did this, I've had ZERO dropped connections.I wouldn't say that the setup and upgrade of this router was particularly easy, but my main complaint has been addressed. If you're confident enough to tinker with this piece of hardware a bit, it may be worth the money."
2,OK for limited Internet use,"This router is a low cost solution for someone who doesn't do a lot of heavy Internet use ie. email and a little surfing.I upgraded the firmware to latest version but the router still occasionaly loses the wireless connection (sucks if you play online games). Tried to enable port 80 forward to setup a small personal website which then caused the router to lockup and I had to reset factory defaults (still haven't go it to work correctly). The router's firmware likes to crash occasionaly when you change settings. If I try to transfer files between computers using wireless it causes the router to occasionaly power cycle.It's cheap and OK if you only need limited use but any sustained use I wouldn't recommend it. I bought this since it was cheap and looking at many posts on the Internet this router along with other DLINK problems have many issues ... I only used linksys before and probably will never by another DLINK product, anyway you get what you pay for."
3,set the preamble to long,"This is an option on the advanced tab, performance section. It ships with the default being short, and disconnects every 2 minutes, even when there is activity.Oh, and go to their website and upgrade the firmware.Otherwise, the setup is very easy.The firewall is easy to setup and use for forwarding ports.Update: Stopped using this in favor of Linksys WRT54GL (Linux version) and that seems to be a more stable router."
1,horrible cheap junk,"Worked okay enough with broadband, but absolutely useless with DSL - constant freeze-ups and dropped connections. And yes, the firmware was updated and I tried every possible settings and tweaks imagineable. Replaced with a more expensive Belkin router that works beautifully. Buh-bye D-link!"
3,Router,"Arrived on time and in good condition. However, no documentation. Would have made things much easier to set up if default IP address had been included."
1,Will waste your time like no other product,"I have had this router for about two years, and it has never worked smoothly. The WPA-Personal implementation simply won't work, just like many of the advanced features in this unit. What is the purpose of including MAC address filtering if the router will have to be restarted every 10 minutes if you try to enable it? That is also true for many other settings in this router. By the way, every time a new device joins your network, it has to be restarted--it could be a laptop, a game console, even another D-Link product simply will not work on the first try. Spend a few dollars more and time and, ultimately, money."
3,Enabling Encryption makes the wireless connection useless,"This works fine with wired and no encryption modes. If you want your data to be safer then this router may not be the best bet.Once I enable the WEP encryption, my wireless connection keeps disconnecting for every few minutes ( some times 2 minutes, some times 10). I've upgraded the f/w to 1.02 ( which supposedly fixes connectivity with my laptops Centrino Mobile)but still the same issue. Made few calls to the support and they tried changing some parameters and obviously for no use :).D-link support web page says, enabling WEP causes wireless connection speeds reduce by 10-25%. May be its the same problem with all the wireless routers. Hope d-link fixes atleast the connectivity issues."
1,You get what you pay for . . .,"...most of the time. In this case, take the $7 and buy yourself lunch - you'll get a lot more for your money. This router is trash. It will never stay connected for more than a few hours at a time. The settings web-interface is unintuitive and the help is no more than a vague description of the ""features."" I've never gotten it to work correctly with multiplayer internet gaming and you can also forget using a psp with it. I'm still using it, and I'm plagued by it every day. One day, though. One day. I will get duct tape it to a tree stump and smash it with a hammer. It will be a good day."
1,Unstable and the worst technical support,I bought this 2 months ago. Since then I couldn't have it working without problems. It reboots itself without any alert. No logs about the problem and D-link don't have any response for this.
1,Reboots and Disconnects,"I had to return one DI-524 because it locked up and would not boot at all. Then, the one I received from D-Link did the same thing after a few days.Now, the router works some of the time. However, now it will drop wifi connections or my Vonage connection. This router is going to the trash. I'm looking for a new router now."
1,Keeps dropping the connection,"Just got this 514 today. I got it on buy.com for 9 bucks so that was a steal. However, I am starting to realise why they gave it away for $9. The setup was pretty smooth. I got it done in one shot. However, it has been dropping the connection every 5 minutes or so, sometimes even more often. I am sitting right in front of the thing and the signal strength is excellent. I do not understand why this is happening.For what I paid, I will live with the dropped connections. This router is not worth even a penny more though, so be careful before you buy.ps. The connection dropped thrice in the space of writing this mail. I am starting to think whether it is even worth what I paid!"
1,Don't buy even if the price is $5,"It crashs every day. Tech support sucks, you will waste your time by calling them. I wasted tenths of hours in calls and reseting the router.My router was crashing every day, I call tech support, they asked to reset the device at least 5 times during a call waiting up to 15 min every time. They never accepted that it was defective. I just gave up. If you value your money and time don't purchase a D-Link product.I got a Netgear and is working great, is a little bit more expensive but it worths."
1,Awful piece of hardware,"This router has been horrendous. Yes, I've upgraded to the latest firmware and I understand how to use it. I have had a couple major issues with it. The first is that the wireless just stops working about twice a week and I have to restart the router. The second is that one time for about a day the router stopped working for all the LAN ports (the wireless still worked). All of them, just done. I tried restarting (again, I did it properly), but it was a futile effort. Then, the next day it started working again after nothing had changed. My most recent issue has been setting up a webserver. Despite properly configuring the virtual hosts, it still won't let traffic go to my server. I even put my server in the DMZ and traffic still couldn't get through! I checked to make sure everything was properly configured (firewall, filtering, etc.). This thing is awful, and I'm saying that even though I paid $10 for it. I'm not sure I'll ever buy another dlink product."
2,Not a good product.,"Used it for about a week now. Constant problems. Half the time you can't access the web based administration. The only way you can fix it is by unplugging it. Sometimes it won't save changes either. I've used Linksys, and I will return this unit and buy the Linksys. I've had a linksys router for about two years now with zero problems."
2,too many drops,"i often play online games, and my router has a consistancy of dropping me from time to time. It'll drop connection and reconnect within seconds, but is very annoying and inconvience for a user as myself. this router is okay for seldom use of the internet."
1,Connection drop-offs,"As others mentioned, it constantly crashes down when the network traffic gets heavy no matter if it's wired or wireless. I wish I could buy an auto-resetting device for it.Now I'm using belkin, which crashes less frequenty than D-link (about once a week). It seems these consumer routers all lack reliability. Perhaps I shall go for a industrial-grade product."
1,Review of D-Link DI-514 Wireless Cable,"My son was unable to estblish a reliable connection to this router from a straight line distance of less than 30 ft, albeit one floor down.We ended up purchasing a Linksys wireless router and he has been able to connect wirelessly with both his PC and his Apple laptop."
5,Gran libro,"Mi primer libro leído en tablet. Este libro fue escrito hace 118 años y al estilo de los mejores clásicos, sin duda fue un placer leerlo en pocas horas. Le doy un 5 porque el libro me gustó, sin embargo las descripciones del paso de un lugar a otro son vagas, poca descripción, como si el autor hubiese tenido prisa por terminar, pero no le resta a la calidad del libro. clásico. Lo recomiendo para tardes frías o lluviosas, pues es un excelente compañero que con su relato nos remonta a los castillos, calabozos, fosos, puentes de ríos, intriga, secuestro, espías (de la época) etc."
4,good book,"Was a really good book for being so short. I liked the chars in the book, onlyl bad thing was it wasn't long enough lol."
2,"Dirt cheap, but probably for a reason","I got this for about eight bucks after various rebates. It indeed prints photos, but will ONLY work with a pictbridge-compatible camera. You CANNOT connect this to a PC, so if the photo on your camera needs a little tweaking, too bad. For occasional photo printing, it's not too bad. I've seen faster printing, and I don't believe I can say that I've seen slower. Best part is probably that a photo inkjet cartridge is provided, which typically costs about 3 to 4 times what I ended up paying for the whole deal."
3,good for the price,"I saw this printer for a very low price so I bought it to try it out. It didn't come with instructions, and after writing the company (Polaroid) I still heard nothing from them. The printer doesn't connect to computers- only to a camera, so I can't figure out how to print specific pictures. Now it prints whatever is on the camera's memory."
3,Dennis' Rouge Squadron Review,"I love this game. The only fault I find is that it is so old that my joystick cannot respond to it as well as I would like it to. Every time I make a turn, it has a second or two delay, making the manuevering very difficult. Had I known this, I would have bought a more recent version. I am not aware of a recent one for PC, but if anybody knows of one, please let me know.Thank you,Dennis Sullivan"
3,"Pretty fun, but also not quite perfect","My brother got this game, and i played it for a while, and it really was addicting and fun, but it got boring as I went further on to the game. Graphics are pretty good, but the storyline, voices, and options were not very good though. My trusty ""Microsoft Percision 2"" joystick wasn't working with the game, either. They should've made it more competative with joysticks, because with joysticks, flight sims would be MUCH MUCH easyer and more fun!"
2,Video is not finalized,It's two sides Russian DVD and video is not finalized (just stops on the middle of pre-final scene) on both sides.
1,yes... no...,I got so tired of the heroine only responding to the earl in one word answers. I thought the character development was a big zero. I usually love Balogh books but this one was a bore. There was virtual know passion between the two so called lovers. If you want passion and tension stay away from this regency from Balogh.
2,"The product will work, but who packs it up for shipping?",It would have been nice to have received all of the hardware to put it together. We had to make 2 trips to Lowes to get the requisite nuts and bolts thank you very little.
4,Adorably Suited for Younger Children,"As soon as I saw this book, I knew a certain friend's little girl would love this book. The pictures are made from pencils, crayons and paint and are beautiful, even the well-known used pictures. Even though Dorothy's blonde hair and stripped stockings might make her look a bit liek Alice and the Lion looks old and skinny/skwauny, and many of the pictures closley follow Denslow's orginal design (cyclone, silvers hoes with ribbons, melting witch, etc.), the children will love this book, because the full original story is here. The Wicked witch has a new skin colour and looks a tiny bit like a vampire, the Winged Monkeys have colourful/parrot-like wings, Scarecrow's shirt is brown, Glinda is beautiful (even if we don't see all her hair) and when Dorothy and Toto return to Kansas, there is a lovely picture of the new farm.I'm sure that any child will love this ediion, even if not all the chapters have a picture."
5,Grandsons,I wanted to share a few of the classics with my grandsons when they are at my house visiting me.
3,The wizard of oz,This book is a classic and I really love that. My sister hates classics that's also why I like it. But I think the book needs pictures
5,I loved the book,It was amazing and had me wanting to keep reading. It was also a short book and I was able to finish it very fast.
3,Great book,"Great book, couldn't stop reading it. A definite page turner. I've seen almost all movie adaptations of this book and reading it definitely made me look at it in a whole new light."
3,"Great book, so-so illustrations","This book is 100 years old, but as Angela Lansbury (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, MURDER SHE WROTE, BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS, THE WIZARD OF OZ: 50 YEARS OF MAGIC, etc) once said ""you can hear the story and a million times isn't enough."" This timeless tale is one you will enjoy indefinatly! This one has NEW illustrations which are not as good as John R. Neil's or Charles Santore's but are better than most. I recommend this book and I think you will enjoy it immensely!"
4,"Exciting, but short","I really liked this book. It was exciting and adventuresome. Best of all, it was free. Yet, it was very short. Normally my books are at least 300 pages, but according to the kindle, it was only (about, I haven't memorized the number) 130 pages. I thought since it's become a movie and everything it might be a bit longer."
2,A Game Is Only As Good As The Support,"The graphics and gameplay are pretty good. Not the best, but worth picking up for a few days of fun and action. If possible, try to pick up a used copy or one that is on sale.However, I did need some support and the makers of this game was unwilling to give any. I've never heard of 2K Games before but if they make anything else in the future I'll avoid picking it up. There are no patches, thier support forums are hardly worth visiting, and when asked to support their game they flat out refuse to do it.So, BUYER BEWARE. When the game works, it is pretty decent. When it doesn't, you are screwed because there is little, if any, recourse especially since the store I bought it from refused to refund the money because it was an open product (I don't blame them, if I ran a computer game store, I'd have the same policy)."
2,"Innovative, but adds a whole new dimension to the term ""gratuitous violence""","I was very impressed with the unique story line and innovative features of this game. But I quit playing the game before I'd even made it through the demo. First of all, the language used by the main character is pretty limited -- I got tired of hearing the word ""f---"". And the violence in the game goes over the top. I've played first-person shooters of all kinds with pretty intense gore. But this is the first time I've seen children as victims of the violence. When I saw that particular scene, I said, that's it. Not for me. Look past it? I could, but I choose not to. I don't feel I need to support a company that goes this far with violence in a video game. I don't see any reason for including children in a story like this."
3,Middle of the pack game,"There are some interesting aspects to this game, but there is nothing ground-breaking regarding the graphics or general gameplay. As most people have commented on various game sites, this is one of the easiest FPSs you will ever play. But it still was fun, and from what I read took a long time to actually get finished"
2,Weak,"I am a regular gamer and thought I would enjoy this when I read about ""good music"" and good playability. Graphics are pretty good but I got bored with it really quick and my guess is most others will too. Played it for an hour whereas I normally beat every game I get."
4,Prey,Good first person shooter. You never really die because you end up in the spirit world where you get to recover and fight again. Some levels take a little more effort to figure out the maze. I needed to go to a third party site to help me through one level. If I would have looked on the floor I wouldn't have needed to. I would recommend it.
3,Shooter or puzzle game?,I bought this game as a shooter so I am wishing they had some way to let a buyer know that it is also a puzzle game. I don't like puzzle games because they can always make them harder than you can figure out just by being non intuitive. I gave up at the walkway puzzle because I just know that this is the way the rest of the game is going to be.
3,Sioux mysticism meets L. Ron Hubbard,"This is a decently paced game with good graphics and an operatic story line. I was particularly struck by the ghost walker mode where the main character is traveling around in an out of body experience. It's kinda like Carlos Casteneda in space though perhaps a little ""hokey"", and without a coherent philosophical message. The intent is good fun but leaning a bit much on the Native American experience as a super power. The American Indian computer gamer is obviously not the target audience."
2,Nothing new just alot of HYPE,"Another FPS set on a lifeless spacestation......did we really need another? Plays just like Halo 2 but with less weapons. Graphics are excellent but nothing new or exciting.I have the game on PC but would have preferred it on XBOX. A controller is much easier to operate then keyboard and mouse, especially when trying to manuver upside down and side ways and shoot at the same time.If this had come out a few years ago it would have been revolutionary but HALO and DOOM have been there and done that."
1,Dud - technical problems,"Got this for my daughter. It was supposed to work on her computer but it doesn't. We kept it because we know that her computer won't last forever and we hope that it will work on the next one, or that she can find a patch or something to correct the technical problems."
4,Purchased to run on linux,"Bought this game due to the new linux client that was released. It uses the data and key from the disks to install.Game looks great and is quite fun. Multiplayer doesn't seem to be working yet, which is a bit of a bummer. Overall, I would recommend this purchase for linux people. At least it will show that there is a linux demographic out there. You can also show your friends that linux is capable of playing semi-current games."
3,Looks good: slow to start out.,"When the instructions to this sand/substrate say to wash until cloudy (not muddy), they really mean to wash it until CLEAR water is the result. This will still result in a cloudy tank for a few days even with agressive filtration with lots of good charcoal. The end result is a lovely looking bed of sand in the tank. Buffering is not great, but I am content with the water we naturally have at my location: basic enough for cichlids. The caution: When initiating a tank, try to have the same water conditions as the store, then slowly introduce fish, then make any changes towards having a more natural water type for your fish. If you introduce poorly managed fish into a well managed tank, one is likely to shock the fish and kill them."
5,"Perfect way to start your day, funny and encouraging.",This was the best daily devotional I have ever read. I can't wait to start my quiet time each morning to see what happens next! A positive way to start your day.
5,Well made hitch,"Well made, accuratelt placed holes, easy to install. The only hard part was removing the towing hook from my car."
5,Perfect,Installed this hitch on my 4runner. Installation was easy. It took less than an hour doing it by myself (which they don't recommend). Hitch is built well and I saved a lot money ordering this on line and installing it myself. I'm very satisfied.
4,"Diverse, Enjoyable Zombie Package","I really enjoyed both of these movies. They satisfy different kinds of urges for zombie movies but I certainly consider them both satisfying and being able to get them at a reduced price as a package was nice. Remakes like ""Dawn of the Dead"" always live in the shadow of the original but this one holds up pretty well and has some of its own flavor. As I write this, I sit a couple of miles away from the shopping mall where the original was shot so I have a pretty high standard! ""Shaun..."" is funny but without being too far over the top. It never completely abandons its roots as a zombie flick though it does have laughs. That's not an easy balance but it walks it beautifully."
3,"Unbelievable, but Catchy!","This is one of those books that's the literary equivalent of potato chips. There's really not much value to it, but it sure does taste good! The story is one that you won't want to put down, a noble (good to the core) executive rescues a kidnapped abused little girl and sets out to return her to her family. I kept wondering why he didn't call the cops instead and his excuse (that she would probably be put in foster care for awhile) didn't totally fly with me, but I went with it. Along the way they are pursued by the head of a child selling ring who's armed and dangerous. The unthinkable keeps happening and if you stop to think about it you'll laugh because everything that can go wrong for this guy does, but it's darn interesting and a quick ride!"
5,best 02sensors for your car,"bought these 02sensors to replace the old oneson a honda crv ex 2004 work great, gas consumptionimprove a whole lot.Would buy from this seller againfor future needs............."
3,Good but could have been better.,Well I received my package promptly witch made me happy but when I opened it two of the bags were torn open witch made for a messy time. I don't think I'm going to order from pet solutions again.
2,Not as advertised.,"The gravel is OK. If you want gravel that is on the darker side....DO NOT BUY THIS GRAVEL! The gravel I received was crushed and whole shell. There were no natural dark rocks to be found. When you look at the picture there are reds, blacks, grays, browns, and different shades of white shells. My 80 lbs of gravel was all white. I would have returned my purchase....but the postage to return would have been too expensive. Otherwise the gravel hasn't killed anything. All of my fish seem to be happy."
4,Using the black foam,"This black foam works as advertised, and a lot of it comes out of 1 can.It is kind of hard to work with - as it just wants to fall strait down as it comes out of the can. I was trying to seal up gaps between my roof and the walls it sits on (from the outside of the cabin), and much of the stuff was falling out of the holes and landing on the ground.I learned that I could use a spatula to pick the foam up off the ground and smear it around the gaps. But even then the work was difficult because the foam wanted to stick to the spatula.The next day, it turned out that the discouragingly small amount of the foam I actually got into the gaps had expanded tremendously and filled the gaps quite nicely.One other note - this stuff stains clothes and your hands. Scrub all you want, if you get it on your hands they will have black spots on them for 2 days. Wear gloves."
3,Used under kitchen sink,I used this under the kitchen sink to create a seal around the pipe where copper wool wouldn't fit. It seems to have plugged the holes but the dispenser tube plugged up with the black foam so bad we had to throw it away after one use.
3,"It's OK, but don't get it.","...I bought these headphones ...figuring they seemed to be a good deal and claimed they had s uperior bass boost. Well, I hooked them up and they are what you pay for. Normal average quality. The bass was not at all what I expected. The bass is, in fact, very weak. Also, I found that after wearing these for about an hour my ears started to hurt. If you're looking for a quick solution with deecent sound like I was, these are good for you. Otherwise, don't get them...."
2,Blindsided by Hazelwood.,"Even though I never believed Hazelwood's prediction for the return of Nibiru in 2003, this book was still a bitter disappointment. Definitely not for the serious researcher. Most of the book was pieced together from the works of other authors, so save your money and go to ZetaTalk.com... obviously Hazelwood did."
3,Entertaining...but...,"This book is a very intereresting read. It does make you look at life in a different way, in that we are very insignificant in the big scheme of things.However Mark Hazlewood has way too much angst towards the american government. every paragraph makes reference to how the ""controllers"" are hiding information from the public. I think this is just a way for him to piece together circumstantial evidence and blame it on the government. However, the book was quite entertaining, and I suggest to those remotely concerned/interested about Planet X to read this book and make your own conclusions. This was Hazlewoods goal. Read it and make your own decision. Because if Planet X exists, its your decision that will ultimately decide your future."
2,He means well...but..,"This book is about Planet X coming our way in the spring of 2003 (Of course it didn't show up). As it always has every 3600 years, it will cause major earth changes and 1/3 of the population will die. Although this book is not very well written, I do believe that the authors intentions are genuine. He really believes what he is saying and presents some powerful evidence that we are in for a world wide cataclysm. Depending on where you live and weather or not you have prepared, you may survive. Of course the government is keeping all this a secret from us while they build their underground bunkers so don't be thinking you can turn to them for help when you see the big red ball in the sky. This book is alright but there are more in-depth books out there on the subject of Planet X."
1,What? Destruction? Death? Imminent?,"Blindsided is blindsided. The writing is very amateur. Not to mention that all Mark writes about is what is freely on the web. This book is useful for the prophecy that is within it's pages and that is all. You will need to sift through the book to find the true prophecy. Of course Marks end dates and the dates of others as they try to predict earth changes is wrong. A little more could have been put into the book if there was not a rush to get it in print. Marks new book ""Deicate Earth"" is nothing more than plagarism and copying from NASA's files and news articles from the internet. A true disappointment."
3,Product Good but Customer Service Bad,I ordered these and then read a review that they run small. I sent two e-mails VIA Amazon telling the seller to cancel my order because I realized they ran small. I sent the e-mails before they shipped. Either Amazon dropper the ball or the seller did. They still shipped. The seller expected me to eat the return shipping cost.The actual product seems to be good quality but they run very small.
3,"Greatest Singer, but Not The Greatest Songs","I'm afaid that this CD is, in my opinion, little better than ""Man and his Beliefs."" I have seven of Paul Robeson's CD's (compiled long after his death), and this is one of the two that don't impress me one little bit."
5,"Paul Robeson, intelligent, versatile",This is a fabulous collection of Paul Robeson songs showing his incredible versatility and intelligence. He sings in various languages and sings songs from many cultures.
4,Great Product!!,"I love this thing. The interior is great. Has a removable lining. All of the supplies needed for a picnic (except the food). Forks, knives, cutting board,plates, cups, salt and pepper shaker, bottle opener, napkins and table cloth. Great, great, great. Would definately reccomend especially is you get a good price. I put it in my basket when it was 49.99 but hesitated so I ended up paying 59.99. Still worth every penny."
2,Kinda grainy footage but good content,"The footage in this video was a little rough around the edges,yet it was still a fun DVD to pop in to watch. It featureda good mixture of attractions.... Too bad it wasn't shot inHD, but no film is perfect.Overall, I'm satisfied with this one, but it definitelycould have been better."
3,Dying to get some details...,"I found this book interesting. I bought this book because I work in a Medical School in Dublin, Ireland and wanted to use the contents of the book as a source of reference. I think the book is probably a bit too expensive for the amount of information that any one individual will get from it. I imagine the readership would be limited."
3,MIX,"This is a good soundtrack overall, but if you listen carefully it's a mix of Horner's previous soundtracks of Balto and his new soundtrack of Troy. I guess he just pulled in some melodies from Enemy at the Gates to use in Troy."
3,"Good Music, But...","Well, the music is O.K. While watching the movie it works, but if you analyze the music a little bit and then you listen to the soundtrack of Schindler's List, you will be really dissappointed... Sounds good, but I already heard that one!I am not throwing to the trash can his work, it is excellent... but it really sounds like the same..."
1,Just buy Schindler's List and SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,Look folks this score is a joke! Basically its another example of Horner ripping himself and other composers off. In this case its John Williams. Horner BLATANTLY steals Williams' theme to Schindler's List. No big surprise from a guy who hasn't had an original score for some time now. Horner has really gone downhill. My advice to anyone interested in him is to look into his earlier works and skip this re-hash.
1,THE BEST SOUNDTRACK EVER EXPECIALY FOR THE WALLS!,"HEY YOU PEOPLE... MUSIC IS NOT SIMILAR! how can you say something like that.... :)) MUSIC IS THE SAME!!!! What horner did this time is, I don't know... it is terrible! There is only one good thing about it: music is very well performed and recorded!The begining is from BREAVEHART, then a trumpet motiv (THE SAME) from PERFECT STORM, and then he takes SCHINDLER'S LIST theme and change it just to make it legaly his! And that's not all! This SCHINDLER's LIST (motiv/theme) is THE SAME as in APOLLO 13... ddddd.. HALLOOO!!!?Speaking for myself I could nerver publish my music if it sounds like that. NEVER! Especialy track 7 ! UUUUUU... I wouldn't even bother whit it. Jesus...My review in scale 1-10 is : 1 (my only soundtrack with 1) NOTICE THAT: count the 5 stars reviews and then look the number of how many people didn't like this review. It makes me laught!"
3,"Decent cd, but not an ORIGINAL score","James Horner's score for Enemy At The Gates is not a bad cd. It has some moments that are dark, and others that are contemplative. His love theme is decent and his chorale pieces are very good and very original. The rest is not. There are parts of this cd that can be interchanged with Horner's scores for the recent Troy or the not so recent Mask of Zorro. When Horner sticks to sounding Russian he does a good job unfortunately he doesn't and like much of his work after Breveheart, his music is recycled. That doesn't mean it's necessarily bad, because it is not. What it does mean is that outside the movie, the listener feels like they've heard the music before and in many cases they have."
3,"A Good Soundtrack, but not Horner's Best","While I rate Horner second only to John Williams in terms of creative talent for motion picture music, I must agree with many of the comments below that most of the music on this soundtrack sounds awfully familiar to other scores he has written. The opening chords for ""The River Crossing to Stalingrad"" was almost an exact replica of the opening scene in Braveheart, and the 4 note theme for Stalingrad repeatedly throughout the score is not only taken from Willow, but used by the same instruments as well. Mr. Horner's true talents were first introduced to me with his Willow score and his score for Braveheart has to be one of the best, rivalling even John Williams, but this score, I believe is not indicitave of his full talent, and displays rather recycled and repeated chords and themes. Listen to the soundtracks for Willow and Braveheart, and there you will find the true genius that is James Horner."
2,Recycled soundtracks,"Usually I am a huge fan of James Horner's work. His soundtracks from Glory, Willow, Legends of the Fall and Braveheart are some of my favorite orchestrations of all time. Unfortunately, Horner did not do as well with this one. Most of the tracks on Enemy at the Gates's soundtrack are TAKEN DIRECTLY from his Willow soundtrack. There is very little new material on this CD. Too bad."
4,Great but not original,Unfortunately James is starting to lose his oringinality. But some of his tracks are very good neverless.For this movie he used a little bit of a Russian twist to his music which is nice.It has very nice Russian male chorus. for that I give the soundtrack 4 stars but the drawback is the music sounds a little bit like another movie he composed for (willow).but the music is not all bad. plus the ending track is wholly oringinal which is another good reason why I gave it four stars.In conclusion a good soundtrack.If you like James Horner's work so much.. This is a soundtrack for you.
2,Horner Went Over The Gate,"Now James Horner has done it!! Throughout his score for ""Enemy At The Gate"", Horner has used his dark four-note motif -I call it the Queen Bavmorda (from ""Willow"") motif -all the time during the 76 minutes of this CD. And that is annoying. And what about that love theme that sounds more like John Williams' ""Schindler's List""? How could anyone be such a ...? The orchestrations might be quite interesting, and the choir singing in Russian fashion is attractive. However, this is one work that might have come out of Horner's recycle bin."
4,CD,In being a Cd the product was just what I was looking for. Cd case was all in place as well as a non-scratched Cd.
4,Good Camera!,"This camera took excellent pictures, and it was perfect for any of my stye choices- any still lifeslooked great, as did motion and landscape pictures. There were no erroes in the camera, and it worked 100% of the time. I'm satisfied completely."
1,Keep Looking,This camera started falling apart feature by feature the minute I started taking pictures. Thankfully Amazon gave me a full refund.
4,Just a bit too expensive...,"I love this lamp. Since it's about 36"" off the desk surface when fully extended, it has no problem perching above even the biggest computer monitors. The light is soft, but bright, and doesn't glare of my monitors. I also like that I can articulate it such that my desk is full of light, but the bulb isn't in direct line-of-sight. The optional desk/table clamp is a great feature for those who don't want to compromise when it comes to desk space. I got this on sale for $95, and am glad I did. Still, the $200 list price from Ott seems a bit ridiculous."
5,Not just for computers!,"This lamp was listed as a computer aid but I've seen it listed in all of the sewing magazines that I receive. It is worth every penny that I paid for it. It is large enough that I can rotate it between my craft table and my sewing machine. The light is bright and does not heat the room like some of the halogen lights that I've used. What's even better, it does not distort the fabric colors. I've even used it for matching accessory colors! The brightness and clarify makes tearing stitches out of dark colors a breeze. This lamp is definitely a necessity for anyone who sews or crafts."
1,The head of lamp sags,"I should have read the review first, but as others have mentioned, the head of the lamp sags. This is because the screw is made of plastic and as time pass, the plastic wears out and it no longer do its work as a screw. I tried tightening it several times but even when it is at the tightest, it sags. Now, because I have tightened it several times, the screw head because it is such a poor quality soft plastic, the head is messed up from the screw driver. I spent $98.00 on it and very disappointed."
2,flashing sometimes,the light always flashes to make me uncomfortable. I don`t know whether it is because of the bump or the ballast.
2,Bring your hearing aid..you'll need it,"Wow, this is the first cd I bought of Tony's.. I read about this great guitarist and I thought I picked up the wrong cd..The souind quality is very poor...you have to re-adjust your stereo just for this cd..The music isn't really bad, just not what I expected after reading reviews of this artist.. I hope he reads these reviews and does some work on the production of his next work.. I was very disappointed and feel kind of ripped off..."
1,It does not even sound like Macalpine,"I was a little disapointed with this album. Tony got distracted with the lirics and lost focus of his great guitar playing skills. Also, very poor sound quality. I want more stuff like Evolution and Maximum Security, those are great albums!"
3,"Not bad, but desperately needs a re-mastering","Love Tony, have seen him a number of times live, and I'm always floored by his technique. I don't even mind singing Tony, but he needs to either work very hard on this aspect of his performance, or leave it to a full time vocalist. He needs to find his range, and stick to it. When he does everything works. When he doesn't, his throat collapses forcing all the air through his nasal cavity leaving the note sounding strained, and somewhat compressed. I hope he finds the time to work on this new craft because I do like the overall tone of his voice ('Still' sounds great). I give a 3 star, until I can hear a decent version - as far as I can tell it sounds like a good performance in desperate need of a studio make-over.DJ"
1,This Sounds Like Someone Else,I've been a MacAlpine fan and have almost all of his albums. This one is a disaster. But I guess an artist will have those every now and then. I guess we'll just have to understand but that doesn't mean it's excusable. Horrendous production and lame songs... I'm sure the next one will be better. Just couldn't get any worse.
4,Just increase the volume and everything's OK!,"The main problem with this album is its quiet recording. This means that you have to increase the volume while listening to it. But in all other aspects, ""Master Of Paradise"" is a brilliant piece of work. The compositions are of high quality both musically and technically.And to me, Tony's vocal embellishes rather than blots out his guitar sound."
1,NOT remastered!,"To call this reissue ""remastered"" is a joke. What did the engineers use, a 10th generation master tape? The poor remastering job is a shock, as most CD's from Japan are of a high quality. If you missed out on buying the LP then by all means buy this CD but if you're expecting a superb-sounding disc remastered from the original master tapes then you'd better look elsewhere, because this CD ain't it."
3,ebbie,when will you be getting more in i want to get it for a christmas gift for a very special person.
4,"a real gem, shame on Lifetime","I only saw it once on Lifetime, and have tried to find it for the longest time. I love the fact that scrooge is a woman and it's modern twist. I also think is it's Susan Lucci's best performance, I never liked her acting much outside of All My Children but I have to say she seemed to really get into this character and enjoy doing this movie. My husband and I love to see the many different versions of this Dicken's tale, have to say this twist on this classic is what makes it a gem."
1,Ebbie's Story,I love this movie. I waited a long time for it to be out on DVD. My daughter bought it for me for Christmas. I couldn't wait to watch it and guess what it wouldn't play in my DVD player. It would only play in my laptop. My DVD player said it was unable to read the disc. Really really disappointed in the quality. I recommended that my daughter get her money back.
5,Great movie!!!,I can not tell you how excited I am that this movie is finally being released on DVD. I have been searching for this movie for years. One of my absolute favorite christmas movies of all time!
5,I LOVE IT!,"Just received this DVD today and the movie is in high quality (as opposed to what a previous review claimed). Sure, there are no extras or commentary and only a basic chapter search, but I couldn't care less. My main goal was to own a quality version of ""EBBIE"" on DVD, so I am very pleased. Besides, any facts you'd want to know about this movie are available online.Also, the CD of Christmas Music puts you in the spirit even more. I only wish they had Carol of the Bells, which is my favorite, but it's still a nice listen.Finally, just want to state I think this is the best female version of SCROOGE I've ever seen. The story is very heartwarming without any sugar-coating. I especially admire Lorena Gale's performance as the Ghost of Christmas ""Present"".If Charles Dickens were still alive, I'm sure he would greatly approve of this version of his widely beloved humanitarian tale."
5,One of My Favorite Christmas Movies,I was so glad I was finally able to get this dvd. I always loved this movie and it hasn't been shown on television lately.
3,Ebbie's Story Miracle at Christmas,Ebbie's Story is the kind of movie I like to watch to put things in proper light. Greed and power can be turned into something wonderful and give hope to the hopeless.
4,nice holiday movie,"i saw this movie many years ago and had been looking for it on DVD for a long time. I was so happy when I found it on Amazon. it's a great version of A Christmas Carol. Susan Lucci plays ""Ebbie"" the female version of Ebenezer Scrooge. Its a nice change up from all the other versions of this beloved holiday classic. I definitely recommend it."
5,Miracle At Christmas: Ebbie's Story with Bonus CD,"If you love Susan Lucci in ""All My Children,"" you will love her in this movie. She is an amazing actor. Excellent plot and story."
3,"No, actually it's really not That good","This album has creativity. It has songs everyone should hear, because they're just that good. The songs that stray from beats and electronica and delve into piano, like NIN, are absolutely incredible. Truth is i only liked one of the ""non"" instrumentals, and that was Valentine. Some of the lyrics are just not good. I was wondering while listining to it for the 5th time, why did he want to do these electronic songs? They're just not good. They dragged on, at least for me, and listen after listen i found myself skipping songs. I couldn't get used to them. They were trite. The album could be worth your money if you're a heavy beats fan. I thank the album for its truly awesome piano songs, and wish the whole album could have been related to that."
1,Have seen it. Not impressed.,"I have seen this thing and it is merely a smear job. Of course, modern political documentaries ARE smear jobs, in general. Michael Moore is the master, and this would have been a lot better if someone of his caliber had made it. His FAHRENHEIT 911 had its own little tricks, such as taking things out of context and editing footage. This one does the same. In general, I rely on my own research and gut feelings when it comes to casting my vote. Everyone else should do the same. Hack jobs like this are not useful information, whether liberal or conservative slanted."
1,Pathetic movie,Whoever made this is clearly lacking a soul. (Ha - Maybe Karl Rove was involved!) This movie appears to have been made by people who are feeling threatened by Mrs. Clinton. It is another twisted attempt to discredit a presidential candidate. The movie has no value or merit. Don't waste your money.
5,Judging before it is released,"Typical liberal postings. Comment on things before they have seen them as they are hypocritcal in their prejudiced opinions. Dick MOrris WORKED FOR the Clintons for years so this isn't a smear job, he knows them intimately. Yet, people comment that this was made by Coulter or Newt b/c they simply follow herd instead of researching their own opinions.Do NOT listen to reviews until it is out to the public on the 15th. These 2 IDIOTS never saw it so their review is MEANINGLESS, like their party."
3,How convenient,How convenient. This won't be delivered until after the Feb 5 primaries. Has there been some undue (but not unsual for the Clintons) influence involved. Similar to the coincidental lawsuit in NV that would hurt Obama but we are to believe that it's just a coincidence that Hillary's friends are behind the lawsuit. Hmmmm
2,Not all that.,"I like to rail on liberals more than anyone, but this movie just doesn't do it for me. After watching it, I thought Hillary was more typical than unusually evil. Maybe my hopes were set to high to walk away loathing the woman, when instead I just said, ""That's Washington.""But then again, these propaganda movies tend to have an opposite effect on me."
1,Politics,"There is little I learned from this video about the subject Hillary. This merely brought it all together in one place. Every single American should see this video. Especially those thinking of voting for her. Unfortunately, a great number of female Americans will vote for her simply because she is a female but that is the status of the average voter. I do not believe anyone would vote for this person to lead our country, along with her husband, who would have a great deal of influence, if they saw this video. She is a treacherous, conniving, power-hungry, insentitive human. In short - a politician!!"
5,I can review it without seeing it too! Wheeee!,"I give it a million stars! No, wait. A negative million stars! Hillary is a horrible, petty, power-hungry person. No, wait. We owe her the presidency for all the mean things we did to Bill. Besides, Bill will be there to help her when she needs it, right? All I can say is, where's the third party?"
1,Billary the Movie is What the Title Should be,"Hold my tongue and fingers til I've witnessed for myself. The boo hoo and phony crying jag didn't work for me. I'm an independent woman who personally frowns upon weak women. For God sake's if you can't take the heat go back to the kitchen and Iron His Shirt, Madame."
1,Unfair + Twisted truth about Hillary,"One word : Biased!I myself is a documentary film maker and I can make Gandhi look bad. Therefore, this film shows nothing but some skills from the story writers and the editing room. I am not a democrat; I still felt the film was distorting truth about Hillary. I mean, she is not perfect. Everyone has good and bad sides and this film shows nothing but her negatives.Message to the film makers: ""please spend this money making film about George W. Bush because he is million times worse than her on the REAL issues."""
1,disappointed in my best friend is invisable,THIS WAS VERY SAD INDEED FOR WHEN MY CHILD PUT IT IN THE DVD PLAYER IT WAS BLANK. WHATS UP WITH THAT> CHILD CRIED. BOOO
2,Just Ok,"I purchaced this DVD for the kids age 8-11 and after they watched it, they said it was not that good and that the other DVD's from Goosebumps were better."
3,Dog loves this stuff but...,"Our dog loves this stuff. I bought it for a occasional treat since he only eats dry dog food, I thought it would be a nice treat for him to have a lil something extra every now and then. But this stuff stinks really bad like dirt, it makes the whole area where the dog eats smell like we just opened and bag of soil in the house. If they could improve the smell of it, that would be awesome, because our dog just loves it but we can't bare the smell of it."
5,Perfecto,"This sweet Puerto Rican has done it again. He has the ability to move you to tears and then make you get up and dance and he uses it perfectly here. ""Te Amo"" a soft but strongly stated love song can almost make time stand still. The other hit ""Candela"" is so skillfully rhythmized you'll be humming it everywhere you go and wanting to hear time and time again. This album is a perfect balance of steaming dance songs, passionate ballads and Chyanne's sweet voice that you'll find ""Simplemente"" simply just irresistable. You'll want to listen to it again and again as I did and still do. Buy it today and enjoy the pleasures of life!"
5,"Another great CD by a great artist, Chayanne!","Chayanne has done it again! Simplemente is another great CD by an exceptional artist with a great voice. Though not as good as his past CD, Atado A Tu Amor, Simplemente is still a great CD, and many of the songs on the CD are wonderful to listen too. Among the good ones are Tracks 1 (Simplemente), 2(Las Horas Pasan), 3(Candela), 4(Yo Te Amo), 6(Ay Mama), 8(Oye Mama), and the last track, Boom Boom. Many of the other songs are very good, but just not as good. However, Simplemente is a must for any fan of Latin music."
5,Simplemente...Chayanne,"Este es uno de los mejores discos de chayanne, tiene de todo. Canciones bailables como Ay mama, boomboom, mariana mambo... y otras bien romanticas como Candela, yo te amo, hasta que el amlma resista. Es bien a lo chayanne;)"
3,Lens is REQUIRED if you have a Sony DCR-SR80,3 stars because my camera is useless without it. Also 3 stars because whne I zoom out completly the image is slightly out of focus and the images are not sharp.
1,Not For DCR-DVD105,"If you own a DCR-DVD105, do not waste your time purchasing this, you will have to return it if you do, even though the description says it will fit the DCR-DVD105 camera, it will NOT!, it is too big, my camera has a Carl Zeiss lens and the female threads on that lens is much smaller than the male threads on the Sony VCL-0630X 30mm 0.6x Wide Angle Lens.That said, I don't know if all of the DCR-DVD105 cameras have this Carl Zeiss lens, if not you may get lucky, but don't be surprised if it doesn't fit when you receive it."
1,BEWARE OF PRODUCT DESCRIPTION!!!!,"The product description says to match Sony DCR-DVD105, which is completly FALSE. I just got the len and is worthless."
5,Wider is better,"Having a wide angle lens attached is awesome! It's a must have accessory. I went with this model as opposed to the upgraded more expensive type and I'm satisfied, although I'm not overly qualified. Fits on my dcr-dvd403 perfectly as isn't so big it's in the way."
5,Works Great!,This wide angle lens works great on my Sony HDR-CX150. It is now a permanent attachment especially I do take lots of video of my kids indoors.
1,Horrible quality!,Very poor sound and tape quality! The teachings may be helpful but it is very difficult to understand the instructions with the heavy accent of the instructor and the home movie sound and picture quality! My tape was bluish and wobbly at the top inch or two of the screen. Even if that did not appear it is if it is an old video recording of a class demonstration. You may have to watch two or three times to get a few clear sentences. Not worth the effort!
4,Speeds up the learning curve,"I, personally, have found it difficult to properly practice Mantak Chia's system using only books. I think the thing that gets me most is the way each part of a technique connects to the next. The transitions have never been terribly clear to me. This video has made the first three quarters of the matching book (about three hundred pages, maybe) fit into two hours. A meditation which originally took me about an hour and a half to practice (by way of looking at illustrations, reading instructions, etc.) now takes about half an hour. So, I have to say, if you're trying to do this without personal guidance, the video is an excellent resource. Oh, and the results from actually doing the practices are spectacular."
1,spicy not sweet,"Bought this mustard because I hoped it would taste like Johnsonville Mustard Sweet N' Hot which I can't find anywhere. This mustard is not at all sweet, and the hot part of it tastes like pure horseradish. Even though I like horseradish and I like mustard, I am disappointed that this ""Sweet Hot"" mustard isn't sweet in the very least. Too hot/spicy to spread on crackers for cheese and cracker snacks (overpowers the taste of the cheese completely), and makes my son gag. He likes sweet mustards, but this mustard is not sweet."
1,why waste the money?,"Why waste the money on a cable like this when Amazon sells their HDMI Amazon Basics cable that does exactly what this does, all for $6.31! People who actually spend a huge amount on Monster (or any other hyped up brand cables) need to actually do their homework first."
2,Not as pictured,"Okay earrings, but the pearls are uneven and to say they have any color at all is a stretch. I haven't worn them."
2,Didn't like it,Not a very good movie. It was billed as similar to Shaun of the Dead. Not even close. Pretty dumb actually
5,Excellent Read Aloud,"I first hear this story at a Woman's Christmas Tea, and each year I look forward to the next year so that I can rush out and get the beautifully written story, a message of the Christmas spirit. This is excellent for all children young and old."
4,The Forced Bride,"This book was interesting but too one-sided from the heroine's point of view. There were a lot of misunderstandings that could have been relieved if she had just asked what she was wondering inside. Good, but there are better romances out there."
2,A Disappointment,I really had a hard time reading this book. I couldn't understand why she lived with him seeing he hated him so much. It was a disappointment. The only real satisfying page in the whole book was the last page. I read a lot of Sara Craven and I know she can do better than this.
2,Erh..,"Despite reading the reviews I decided to give the book a chance, what a waste of time and money. The plot while intriguing, leaves a lot to be desired. The heroin is overly naive and the hero is flat. The writing style also needs work, flipping between third and first person, leaving the reader disliking the heroin more. In short save yourself a headache and keep searching for another book."
1,skip this one,"I read a lot of older HQN romance books so I am used to the H not listening when the h says NO. That aside, I am still wondering about the dialogue between the H and h when they in the cabin discussing his other woman. She asks him if he plans to remarry and says yes. The other part that needed closure IMo is when the OW confronts the h before h leaves H. I would've liked to have read about a confrontation between H/h and the OW."
3,it was ok,"it was from just her side we never found out what he was thinking or saying behind her back. i would not get this book for people who are thinking about geting it. DON""T"
5,Best coverage of philosophy of science,"Unit IV has four of five chapters covering Philosophy of Science. This is some of the best coverage of the topic that I've read. The length of the text makes it a little intimidating--OK, very intimidating--but most of it is just enjoyable reading--IF you are not going to be tested over the material. I keep reading the chapters on Epistemology thinking sooner or later I will feel competent to explain it to my students, but that feeling has not come yet. (I don't teach philosophy, but chemistry.) I don't blame the authors for this. And I'm not saying I have no understanding of epistemology...but how much do we need to understand about this topic? The psalmist said ""Never Enough"" (on a different topic, no doubt). I bought this book on the Lay-A-Way plan...and it was worth it. Very helpful to my thinking and teaching. Kudos."
5,Essential contribution to Christian philosophy,"A very difficult book indeed. So much food for thought for the advanced student. Yes, Christianity is intellectually viable and adequate as these authors demonstrate. The book has a nice organization as far as topics go. Its weakness is the rigor of terms and assumption of a through philosophical background on the part of the reader. Key terms are highlighted throughout the book. A glossary with written definitions of these terms would help. Suggested background reading in each chapter for the novice would also be helpful. Nancey Pearceys Total Truth is a more relevant/applicable text of worldviews but this text is the ""summa"" of worldview material in the Christian religion. If you have a college background in philosophy, get this book. If you are a novice, you may not be able to actually read and grasp this book, still but this and take it as a long-term challenge."
5,Wonderful,"Personally, I loved this game. But I can't tell the difference between regular Infernal Maachine and Archive Infernal Machine...Oh, well. I did enjoy the puzzles that this game had, but my least favorite part were spiders. The spiders (in the game, obviously) are about the size of a small, monitor screen. Plus, they just come out and surprise you! If you see a spider web (looks like icicles hanging from a door-way) look UP! If you don't, they will surprise you. If you're a fan of the Monkey Island series, type in F10, makemeapirate, then use the bazooka.This is definatly a classic game, and I would reccomend buying it, but not if you have arachnphobia! (I also liked the inflatable row-boat...)"
3,Too Hard,"Without all the gamer equipment, I find this game too difficult to play with a touch pad mouse. I even disabled some attack features and it's still frustrating to play, even with a cheats guide. There are different levels of skill available but even the easiest is difficult. Failure to be able to save within a section requires complete replay to eventually get through it. I'm not a spastic, but this is not fun anymore."
5,everything you could want,OUR LADY PEACE never ceases to amaze me. this album is truly touching and timeless.
4,A great album,"I never really liked OLP before I heard this album. Naveed and Clumsy were nothing special to me. Then I heard some songs from Happiness and found them more interesting. That inspired me to go out and buy Spiritual Machines the day it came out. This is an excellent album with great tunes, inspiring lyrics, and an impressive overall feel. I have listened to it over and over and am not tired of it yet. There is not a single song on this album I don't like, and the spoken word tracks by R.K. add an interesting element to the album. My advice, go out and get this album."
2,They have better albums,"Great band, but this album is for the diehard fans only. Most reviewers who are OLP fans seem to take jabs/shots at their other albums that had some radio-friendly music like Clumsy, Gravity, and Healthy in Paranoid Times. I disagree. I see those albums as refined- not sell outs, and this album as more raw and unrefined. As an example, while I like all my OLP albums, this one isn't played in general or mixed company unfamiliar with OLP)."
5,"Amazing, but who expected less?","Of course there is ""Life"", the number one release. An amazing song, but like my title, Who could have thought less of OLP? ""Are you sad?"" is another great one. The whole album in fact is awesome. What can you say? Our Lady Peace only gets better with age."
5,Our Lady Peace gets Spiritual and real,"I live in the US but I immediately pre-ordered this CD from Canada to get it as fast as possible. All I can say is ""WOW!"" This band has continued to grow ever since their first release of Naveed through Clumsy, Happiness, and now this. Songs like ""Right Behind You"", ""Everyone's A Junkie"", and ""Middle Of Yesterday"" bring back the the rock essents of Naveed and Clumsy while ""In Repair"" and ""Made To Heal"" are more reminicent of stuff from Happiness... The band shows serious growth on the uplifting ""Life"" and the haunting ""Are You Sad"". This CD is definetly worth pre-ordering and will make a huge splash when it is released in the US in March."
3,Happiness is an album that you have to give a chance.....,"I totally disagree with the person that said 'Happiness' was a mess. (I am a huge fan that has actually met the band on several occasions just by going to so many of their damn shows.) Happiness just threw people for a loop because it was so different, especially those who aren't big OLP fans.Happiness is my second fav. OLP album now, after Naveed. If anything, Spiritual Machines lacks spirit(especially in the production area, but Bob Rock's production of them just sucks). Do yourself a favor, pick up Happiness first, and if you don't get that, you will not fully get this album either. Take it from someone that has been a fan since the 1st album."
3,amazingly average,"This is an ok effort from OLP. The spoken dialogue in between songs doesn't fit. It would seem to go better with a heavy metal type record. The word ""friends"" is used a LOT on this album. Feels like in every song, ""Life"" ""In Repair"" and ""Middle of Yesterday"" are the best songs on the album. Ok effort from a group that started off so strong, still isn;t bad but not what they could have been."
5,Haunting LP,"Being a fan and awaiting this album for a very long time. When I got my hands on it I listened to it once, then again and again. It's simply amazing how every single track is good. Between some songs you have Ray Kursweil giving his tidbits which fit right into the songs. Lyrically this is one of their best. Raine Maida never lets you down, allthough it's kind of different on here. Instead of his normal real depressing and dark lyrics you have some real upbeat ones and I think that's great. A fan of any music will adore this cd. Stand out tracks ""Are you sad"", ""Life"", ""Made to Heal"" and ""In repair"". Don't wait to buy this you won't regret it, simply amazing."
4,A really good sleeper album,"This album got no press, but is actually really good. My only quarrel with it is the commentary on practically every other track...that got a little old. But the music is good, especially Mafia."
5,neverending.,"Spiritual machines introduces a totally different sound prior to clumsy and naveed. The lyrics possess a strong definition of life and meaning. Raine Maida's voice adds to the character of Our Lady Peace, and brings it out extremely well. The drums are also fantastic. Indeed, Our Lady Peace is one of the best bands on earth, and their success will be neverending."
2,I was expecting a rock album from a rock band,"Compared to Clumsy, which is the best album to date, spiritual machines is not a patch of what they are capable of. Their first album Naveed rocked and the follow up Clumsy blew me away. This album is just like the Happiness album, they seem to have lost their way, if your expecting anything like the first two, you will not get it, their music has turned very radio friendly and you will be disapointed. I think they have churned out a rushed, incomplete album which is by far the worst OLP yet. When i was listening to the album, i kept expecting it to kick into a good rock song.....but it didnt. i just hope they will go back to their original style. and thats all ive got to say about that."
1,unoriginal,I liked this album...four years ago when it was called OK Computer. bad rip-off of Radiohead's concept album about technology. even the video for the single immitates the OK Computer artwork.
5,OLP - Spiritual Machines,"The album gets better everytime you listen to it. I first saw OLP perform in concert in April and I have not stopped listening to this album, as well as the other 3, since then. I highly recommend seeing them perform their live show if you have the chance."
4,Our Lady Peace -- Mind Games?,"How can a band make such great tunes?If you knew me, you'd know I'm a sucker for tunes. What attracts me the most about a song it's the music and only then the lyrics (if you're raising a brow -- a lot of people listen to music with annoying music because they love the lyrics -- I have friends like that), but if a band can take great music and add lovely lyrics to it (""Are You Sad?"" especially, FMO), plus a special voice such as Raine's, and make an album such as ""Spiritual Machines"", I'll worship the ground it walks on alongside to OLP.What am I trying to say? Listen to a song or two from the CD. Like it? Go buy the CD. Don't? Oh well- can't argue about the taste. But I promise, if you buy this CD you won't be disappointed.One complaint though - The R.K.'s."
5,a new and fresh idea,"Our Lady Peace's new album has made an impact on me, and others I know. OLP examins new ideas of how computers are going to take over people and the earth in all. Spiritual Machines is a new and innovative idea which brings pensive thought to the human mind. Many of the songs are indefinately worthy of airtime and is suitable for a variety of listeners. Overall, there is nothing to dislike about this CD, there is so much to it. I would suggest buying it to anyone!!"
5,Album of the year,"Although it is still early in 2001 this has taken an early lead in my opinion for album of the year. Are you Sad and Life are two beatiful songs while songs like In Repair and All my Friends leave you humming the songs in your head over and over...the interludes are nothing short of brilliant, like the rest of this album. great work boys, you've finally hit the big time"
5,Crecy version modifies original text,"I write this review only to note my displeasure that Crecy has Anglicized the spellings in this book. Such editorial changes seem inappropriate to me. ""Color"" is spelled ""colour,"" ""center"" is spelled ""centre,"" and so forth. I cannot imagine a U.S. publisher with the chutzpah to change the British spellings in, say, Peter Townsend's autobiography. The original manuscript should have been left alone."
3,"The noisy ""Thud""","The plane is huge; sitting nose-high on it's lanky gear legs. It makes a roar you won't forget, and men flew this aluminum overcast, propelled by an engine big enough to move a truck uphill, over the steaming jungles of Vietnam. I've met these men, face-to-face, and came away in shock at their stories of battle. One pilot, a man nicknamed ""Cal"" Jewett, was an instructor at the USAF Test Pilot School where I worked. He would regale us laymen with his exploits, as well as some little known post mission activities. Many ""Thud"" pilots were former tanker pilots, and they had to learn how to fly all over again; the F-105 was a totally different beast! This very interesting story is but a small sampling of the many varied missions brave pilots flew in this remarkable airplane."
4,ThAnk YOu RObERt SmIth!!!!!!,"Okay, yeah, I'm glad to find out that I'm not the only person out there who reads books becos some rock star tells her to! But I was just wandering around some Cure sites, and found out that both the songs ""Charlotte Sometimes"" and ""A Letter to Elise"" (my favorites, but that's another story) were based on this book. I vaguely rememberd having a copy from when I was wee, so I freed it from the attic and read it, and damn was it great! You don't know quite where it's going until the very end...read it, you'll be glad you did."
5,Attention Cure Fans,"The band The Cure ( my favourite!) wrote a song about this book of the same name. If you have wondered about it read the whole story, the video for the song is based on the book as well. The book is very good"
3,Charlotte Sometimes,Charlotte Sometimes is a book for about 10-14 year olds Penelope Farmer has thought up a very new and exciting way of time travel.Charlotte gets really confussed as everyone is calling her Clair! But why? And what is the secret of the great cedar tree? Does it's sinister branches hold the key to the Mistery?
3,"good, but missing something","This book is a great idea, but, it seems that content is missing. It's as though the general idea is there, however, the author could have expanded ideas or methods in which the characters could be in contact with one another. I realize its a children's book though, so it cant be too full of information. Good book, I remembered it from my childhood and had to find it. I recommend it!"
4,Good value for money,I loved this watch. I feel I got good value for my money. Will recommend it to others.
1,Stare at it long enough and your acne might go away.........,"Have bought two of these zeno's so far from amazon and have yet to have one that will turn on or charge for that matter. Am not impressed. Dont waste your money, as the title says ""Stare at it long enough and your acne might go away...."" Cause thats all i've been able to do is stare at it and hope it turns on.Dont buy!!!!!!!!!!!! Not worth the waste of money."
3,Just don't drink it straight,"Somewhere I read that this tastes almost identical to cow's milk, so perhaps my expectations were too high. I do not like it by itself, and that is why it is receiving three stars. I want something that I could have with a chocolate chip cookie, and this just doesn't work. It has a sweet malty taste. Don't think vanilla shake - it's more like instant breakfast or vanilla SlimFast. It works for cereal if it is seriously watered down. I haven't tried it in baking, but I have heard and could imagine that it would work great in baking. I like that it is powered because it is easy to keep some in my purse when I travel. I do have to say that my husband liked it and said that he doesn't mind drinking it by itself."
3,Great for a painter getting started,This book has useful information if you are a 2-D artist and you are just getting started marketing your art. The version I have was last updated in 2007 and I was quite disappointed it only briefly touched on internet marketing. The book is geared towards painters also.
4,Good book for selling art,I was recommended this book by my wife's art teacher. It is pretty good for someone who wants to sell their art. I recommend it.
4,Informative and Easy to Understand,"Constance Smith provided a book that is very informative and accessable. There are many creative ideas and she does a great job of covering the basics. The focus of the book is primarily toward commercial not academic art but there is still plenty enough material to make it worth the time of any artist whether they be the most conceptual artist or a self taught folk artist.I very much appriciated that Chapters on ""The Psychology of Success"", ""Business Basics"" and ""Sales Techniques."" These areeas are seldom covered enough but are very important."
5,Art Marketing 101,Great Must Have Book for any Artist!!! This book gave me great insite on what to do once I was finished creating art. It helped me place my artwork in the right market place and sell my art. I think anyone who paints or creates needs to have this book.
2,Better Choices Are Out There!,"In preparation for teaching a class in marketing for creative professionals I purchased this book. Although it says it was revised in 2000, I found some egregious errors, one of which was a listing for a book that's out of date and out of print. Carroll Michael's book, How to Survive and Prosper as an Artist, is a far better reference and empowers the artist in his/her efforts. Smith tends to buy into some of the 'starving artist' concepts and, instead of cheering artists on, creates some real barriers to success."
1,"Should last more than 2 months, but it didn't.","This looked like a great product, but unfortunately, after three or four uses in less than 60 days, it stopped working. It has a one year warranty, so we'll be sending it back to the manufacturer. This means we won't have it to use. We'll see how they honor their warranty and how fast we get one back.Service is everything with a dud product."
5,Worth the extremely low price.,"If thise book cost 10+$ I would say it would be a borderline buy. This has good information regarding the mental game, and also helps to make people realize how important the physical part of the game is. He helps you understand how important staying in shape is and keeping your muscles working so they don't tire out mid season. He has very good info regarding the Jobe work out, and has good workouts, but with semi outdated technology. Love the book and am buying 2 other more in depth mental books. This book is very good for any age/level of baseball and helps people to understand you can go on talent alone, but it only gets you so far."
3,Writes more on working out than pitching,"When I bought this book, I was expecting Ryan's knowledge of mechanics, and form to be shared. I was disappointed to find that the book discussed more on your workout schedule. More pages of the book were devoted to strecthing out than on the mechanics of picthing. If you are expecting to learn Ryan's secret to pitching, you are barking up the wrong tree."
2,No Meat,"This book was casual to read, flip through, but did nor have any real information that would help a pitcher. It did have a big name in the title."
3,"Too much conditioning, not enough on how to pitch","I thought too much of this focused on the conditioning and strength-building aspects of Ryan's approach to pitching, and far too little on the mechanics of pitching, which would be more helpful for younger players"
5,Pitcher's Bible,"This book is great...whether you're just starting to pitch or have been pitching for years, the information in this book is some of the most useful I've read."
5,WONDERFUL WRITING ABOUT A YOUNG LIFE,"This memoir is about the author's youthful life up 'til college time. He comes from a large family and makes it easy for the reader to keep track of everyone. His mother is the stable one (tho she has some strange ways, also) and his father an alcoholic, though he becomes more rational as he ages. Norman is now age 62 and he makes his life most interesting while a youngster in small Southern towns. A fast read, too."
5,Fun and Challenging,"Me and my twin brother love this game. Fighting Darth Maul is really cool. Its fun when you're Qui-Gon Jinn because you get to kill a giant monster. We like the R-65 Heavy Blaster because it bounces off just about everything. The only thing we don't like about the game is that if you jump on some things, such as a roof, you will fall right through and die."
1,works for about 5 minutes,"forget the issues with trying to switch the tips, this ""sandy"" part on the tips rubs off almost immediately. i purchased this mainly for softening the edges of my beads (so the thread doesn't break), and it worked very well, that is until all the sandy stuff came off. now i have a worthless tool. quality is F-"
4,"Great movie, but one part were too corny.","I watched this movie and I thought this movie is great, but in one part it's too corny (to me anyway). Even though it's just a scene I felt wierld watching it, but it is still well worth the money."
4,Ode to 'Mr.' Craig Ehlo...Pluto's best and Bob Ryan FINALLY did something right!,"Great synopsis encompassing some of the bestof alltime: Bird, Ehlo, Jones, McHale, Parish,Johnson, Wilkens et, al. Not just a game betweenthe Celtics and Cavaliers back in Nineteen EightySeven. Jerry Sichting comes off well in here aswell, his comments. Sichting from Indiana is to-day Kevin McHale's top Sgt. in Minnesota."
4,Good but too straight!,"I used this on my daugter's very thick hair. I expected a ""softener"" not a straightener because the box and website mentioned it would only loosen the curls. It did, however, make her hair alot more manageable, and that was the key for me. After applying it the first time, I said I wouldn't do it again because it got too straight for me, but now about 6 months have passed, and I've decided to reapply but just not comb it through as much."
4,"Better than I thought, but would have like a little more straightening","I tried this product a couple of days ago. So far, so good. I used it exactly as the directions said. The only thing I would change is that I would have started in the center of my head, which is the most unruly section. The thing I like most about it is that I have a very, very, very sensitive scalp and this product didn't burn me at all. I didn't like how difficult it was to rinse and wash out. I used the entire bottle of shampoo and would have liked to have had more! All in all though, I am pleased and will most likely use it again."
2,Too Straight...,"This product is not a texturizer. It is more like a relaxer, I can't believe this product is stronger than a regular relaxer. If you are looking for texturizer I would not recommend this product. It turned my curly hair into straight hair, hopefully it will grow out. I miss my curls :("
3,"Very soft, but too straight","I purchased this yesterday to looses my hair which has very tight curls but is not really coarse and is slightly thin. What I got was straight hair, which was not what I was expecting. If I would have know, I would have diluted this product with a conditioner like I normally do. I am afraid to try my hair curly, so I can only give this three stars. I hoep that I haven't lost all of my curls, but that is what it looks like. I would recommend this to poeople with very tight thick coarse curls to loosen the curls, but not your normal ""puerto rican curls""."
2,Oh Heck NO!!!,"This product was something I was curious about even though there are mixed reveiws as the saying goes dont knock it until you try it. Well I tried so knock it all you want. PLEASE DO NOT get this product even out of curiousity. I should have known better I cant even be mad that it F'd up my hair because I knew the risk I just want my curls to not be so spirally, well I got my wish.... yea right more like a nightmare I literrally did not comb, left it on for less than 3 mins and wash it out did all the steps (yes I read the instruction twice), beause I didnt want any mistakes well I guess my hair couldnt handle it the product because that bottom half of my hair is completely straigt and the rest of my hair is wavy. :) Aww so sad I thought I couldnt wear my hair down then shoot definitely cant now. SPARE yourself the pain and embarassment and leave you gorgeous hair alone ladies."
4,Not what I expected,"I purchased this product after growing my hair out for 8 months. The new growth was becoming increasingly unmanageable and all the literature on this product suggested it would make my hair more manageable without straightening it. I have what I would describe as medium textured hair (not fine/thin but not coarse). After applying the product and combing through once as per instructions I was left with straightened hair. Despite this however, my disappointment in once again having straightened hair was tempered by the fact that my hair had more movement and body and individual strands were stronger than when my hair was previously relaxed. It is also touchably soft all the time. This product should perhaps be marketed as an alternative to a relaxer rather than a texturizer as, unless yor hair is very coarse, expect the same results as a regular relaxer though far less harsh. Yes, it does burn if your scalp has been irritated!"
4,Charming and Sweet,"A fun to watch film provides good vibrations all around. Janet Leigh steals my heart in this film, can't take my eyes off of her. She is the reason most guys will watch this film. Also, if anyone has an apartment for rent in Greenwich Village for $65.00 a month please call me."
1,Screwball yes; comedy not so much.,"Having enjoyed much of this genre, with Irene Dunne, Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, you know the usual suspects, I was disappointed by slow pacing, plot gaps, mismatches in talent. This is going right to the used DVD store ...or the recycle bin."
4,Entertaining Classic!,"What a great movie! It is refreshing to see so much energy brought to the silver screen. The casting makes this movie! It has something for everyone: dancing, singing, funny misunderstandings, apartment problems and much more. This movie provides the entire family with good clean entertainment which is almost extinct in today's Hollywood. Jack Lemmon is wonderful opposite Betty Garrett. Janet Leigh also does a superb job as the sister with everything!"
4,Little seen gems.,"I had never seen any of these films before, but loving the two lead actresses in their other screwball roles made me purchase the set immediately. ""If You Could Only Cook"" was our family's choice for favorite. ""Too Many Husbands"" was similar in plot to ""My Favorite Wife"" and the remake ""Move Over, Darling"" but it never quite measured up, and the ending was very lame.The original ""My Sister Eileen"" was a good vehicle for Russell's brand of humor, but ""She Wouldn't Say Yes"" didn't hold up as well. The four star rating is an average for the 4 pictures together. I would definitely recommend this set to lovers of classic comedy."
4,Enjoyable,"This is not a great movie musical, but it was enjoyable. It was also a treat to see Bob Fosse perform and see some of his early choreography."
3,OK,"It's called ""Screwball Comedy"" and that's exactly what it is but it wasentertaining. Sit back in your favourite chair with a cup of tea and abiscuit and enjoy.Sharon."
5,Ballades is Nana at her best,"In French, Nana blends her voice to the music in perfect sync. I listen to this disc often, cause it is so enjoyable. One reviewer said Nana's French CD's were her best, and I understand why she/he thinks so. Nana's diction is perfect, her blending voice to music is perfect, and her emotion is perfectly rendered."
4,A good and useful manual!,"I'm an NLP Master Pract. and I work as Human Resources Consultant. THE SOURCEBOOK OF MAGIC is a comprehensive manual with a very useful approach and a very clear style. A solid background contribute to the success of this book, the only limit, I think, is that the authors swift a glance at the techniques, without a deep approach. A manual good for NLP pract. and master pract.; other people should begin reading ""The Structure of Magic"" by Bandler/Grinder. I will read other books by L.Michael Hall, I liked his ideas about Semantic, Cognitive Theories (Korzibsky), etc...If you want to change experiences and ideas about NLP and Human Growth you could write me at albirub@virgilio.it"
2,Disappointing.,"If I took the dictionary and put the words in a slightly different order and changed the definitions a little bit (used different words but with synonymous meaning), and then I expected to take credit for my ""original work,"" people would think I was both a nut and a sham.I, for one, am tired of the parade of NLP books that simply regurgitate techniques that can be found elsewhere--hopefully in books authored by the creators of said techniques.Do we really need yet another NLP book that teaches, second hand, what the rest of them do? How many authors quoting material from authors quoting material from authors (and hardly ever giving proper credit in the proper place) do we have to endure?I hope everyone involved in creating these techniques are getting royalties from this book. Probably not.My advice, go buy the ""original"" books by Bandler, Grindler, Dilts, and the Andreases. It may cost you more, but you will be getting it from the horse's mouth, not from some parrot."
3,Best NLP reference Ive found,"I find myself returning to this book over the years as a great resource tool for strategies. Basically it's an encyclopedic list of ""how to"" from everything from allergy cures to self integration.If you're into NLP, this is a solid part of your library."
2,Bah Humbug,"Cool, I thought, some rockin' Christmas tunes from Billy Idol. Wrong !!! There really isn't anything on here to set it apart from the hundreds of Christmas albums out there. I like Billy Idol, but was disappointed with this CD."
2,Billy Idol,"The CD came in quickly which was much appreciated, however, Billy Idol has no place making a Christmas CD. Thank heavens it was a gift and not for me."
1,What the hell is this?!,"Billy, Billy, Billy... What's happening to him? It's like went from being the yelling rebel I grew up listening to, to Bing Crosby. I didn't wanna give this legend a bad review, but it's for the sake of sanity. I give this album 1 star for his great voice, but it's still not worth buying..."
4,Not your parent's Billy Idol...,"It's a great holiday album, but not in Billy Idol's trademark style. He gets a little close to his 80's rocker shouting on tracks like ""Santa Claus Is Back in Town"" and ""Merry Christmas Baby"". The real missed opportunity here, in my opinion, is that he didn't sing ""White Christmas"" to the tune of ""White Wedding"". That would have been awesome. (It's a nice day for a...WHITE CHRISTMAS!) What about ""Dancing With My Elf""?"
4,This guy can sing.,"I know, I know.... I'ts Billy Idol. The guy with the hair and the sneer and the in your face punk attitude. I saw him live ""back in the day"" and he sang a ballad. Don't remember what it was but he can really sing when he wants to. He has an excellent voice. He just never dispayed it with all of the punk/pop stuff he's famous for.Well get ready. He does show his voice off on this cd. He is really good and I promise, if you can get past the fact that it's Billy Idol, you're gonna love it. If you like well produced, traditional Christmas music from a guy with a really good voice, give this cd a try."
1,"Be serious Billy, what a joke!",billy idol christmass album... common... what a joke... avoid to hear or buy this... buy the 80s serious albums...
3,Decent workout,"This video is decent. Can sometimes be hard to follow, but if you keep at it, it should work for you. I personally think women are better at leading the routines....just saying."
2,Slow ...,"The pacing on this DVD is very slow. Marc's Rhythimica DVD has the same moves but at a much faster pace. Rhythimica, in my opinion, is a better workout. I found this DVD very slow and boring with his slow, prolonged, instructional cadence before going full tempo."
1,Poor quality merchandise.,"This CD/DVD set was poorly recorded and edited. I'm not a professional critic, but as much as I like Brenda Lee, I played the DVD right away. It was very disappointing. I've been to a live Brenda Lee concert, and she puts on a fantastic show so I know that this set should not be used to evaluate her many talents.There were no problems with the seller--it arrived even before the due date and was in perfect conditiion. The problem was in the manufacture, not the delivery of the product."
1,B & H PZ3300 Not worth 0 Cents,"Pur PZ3300 2 years ago and when it worked, it was good. Have shot about 8 roll thru it. Pd $60 at WalMart. Now I get a flashing timer and the only buttons that work is the ON/OFF and the mid-roll rewind. Put in new battery and film may give you 1-4 shots before it goes into flashing timer mode. The sparse instruction manual tells you to ""Complete Data Setting Mode"" but does not tell you how to do this as the only button that works is the ON/OFF. Contacting www.jazzphoto.com is out of service. For $22.50 it can be sent off to NJ address but who knows if they exist either. I can say however that the case is worth about $10 but the camera is 0 cents. Don't buy this faulty unit. Paying $60 for camera to shoot 8 rolls of film and ruin 3 more roll is not worth it. Not what I would expect from Bell & Howell."
1,Very Poor Sound Quality,"I read a review of the ""Three Choral Suites - Ben Hur, Quo Vadis, King of Kings by Erich Kunzel-Cincinnati Pops Orchestra and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir""(a TELARC release)that said something like this: ""If you really want to hear how this music should sound get the 'Miklos Rozsa Conducts His Epic Film Scores'."" I already had the former disc (and love it) so I ordered this suggested CD. I was excited to hear what this music ""should sound like"" so when it arrived and I played it, I could not have been more shocked. It is the most ""tinny"" (high pitched) sounding recording I have ever heard. The quality of this recording is horrible. If you have a good sound system that brings out the essence of the music with presence and warmth you, too, will be disappointed in this CD. (Unless you are one that favor gimmicks, high sounding flavors, and/or cookbook-style sound that strays from the total fidelity of the original source. To you, I say, enjoy.)"
5,best bundle ever,This was a great way to begin Gena's books.I am now hooked and have purchased over 15 of her books now.
1,Jesus save me from Zig!,"I bought this expecting motivational insights a la Earl Nightingale, but instead I get a sermon I could hear in any fundamentalist church. I think the other reviewers should have to state their religious beliefs as part of the review process. I bet all the 5 star reviewers are Born Agains."
4,Over the Top,"Good book it covers a lot of advise on how to get to the top, a lot of expireinces are very good others do not apply to everybody life style, but in general good book, I am glad I read it.Gloria Perez"
2,another book review,Cover jacket was scuffed and had a sticky residue that I couldn't get off. The pages were yellowed and appeared very old. Promptly received.
4,Great,The only way to keep my grandchildren seating in front of the tv and not fighting . I have ever DVD there is and they keep ask me for more. I even like watching them
3,Pretty Good Episode...Not great.,"Even though this DVD hasen't been released yet, I remember this episode constintly being re-run on FOX KIDS. It was an alright episode from what I can remember. I don't want to give away the ending or anything but I think the kids end up being robots."
2,Same old same old...,"I've been a fan of BLACK 47 from their first release. And I'm just obsessive-compulsive enough to have all of their CDs. After listening to ""New York Town"", I must say that I've heard it all before. Does Mr. Kirwin EVER change his singing style? I found his voice modulation and practice of forcing way-too-many words into just about every song irritating. Before the first song was over this thought went through my mind: Could I be playing ANY of the other BLACK 47 CDs?I've given considerable thought to this review. I've regarded the progression of other musical artists through their careers and how the evolutionary process either added to or detracted from their quality and attraction. In brief: change is good. BLACK 47 (aka Larry Kirwin) cannot or will not change. Therefore, my collection of BLACK 47 music must now, as of this latest offering, be considered complete."
4,disappointment,"After returning from the Ireland tour with the band I was awaiting a real tour de force with NY Town but this is not the subdued moving album I was expecting. Been a fan since the beginning but gotta be honest, 3 remakes and some old chord progressions through out makes this hard to grasp. Half their songs are about NY anyway, they could have remade them all and put them on here. The originals are all quite strong but there are quite a few moments lyricaly where a word will seem forced to finish the line. This album has grown on me after a few listens but Id be lying to say its up there witht he rest of their material.note: FATIMA was originally on Larry's solo album and in all honesty should have been left there. It was perfect."
3,Could be better with different vocalist.,"The music is actually pretty cool, I'd recommend this band to any metal fan if they had a real singer. Most hardcore singers are like pondscum; bottom-feeding idiots. I've heard five hardcore singers that I like and I know one of them. This guy is not one of them."
2,Luke warm at most,"This is the first Haunted album that sucks. The first was amazing, the second was cool, a change in sound but not in quality, the live album was pointless and boring, and OKW is pants. They only did the live album out of contractual obligations coz they thought they could get off Earache that way, and on this album it sounds just that, going though the motions, some half-arsed riffs, only DOA is any good. Dont fool yor selves into thinking this is good, everyone knows its not a patch on the first album. Thank god peter dolving is back into the fold, their new one should hopefully remedie this waste of 10."
1,archenemy rip off... (Thrash sucks),"As if slayer isn't terrible enaught...They give us ""the haunted""i mean do they want to rip off slayer & archenemy ?I mean i understand if you love both of those bands but why rip them off ? I remenber living sacriface rip off slayer once and they got a amazing back lash!Anyways,I hate thrash metal thats why bands like slayer, carnal forge ( i think that's how you spell their name ) all suck! I never got into slayer---the only bands i basically listing to in the 80's was metallica,iron maiden,megadeth,ozzy,black sabbeth but i realy did never got in crap like slayer...I dont know but thrash isn't my thing, i tempt to stick only with deathmetal & grind and some times metalcore but not thrash! Skipt this and support shadows fall alright!The guys from shadows fall rule but the haunted doesn't!"
3,The Haunted - 'One Kill Wonder' (Earache),"'One...' is the Swedish death metal band's third release,it's an okay effort,that is if you like the genre.Tunes that I thought were decent enough are ""Privation Of Faith,Inc."",the in-your-gut slammin' ""Demon Eyes"",""Sh**head"" and ""Bloodletting"".Line-up:Marco Aro-vocals,Anders Bjorler-guitar,Jonas Bjorler-bass and Adrian Erlandsson-drums.Just might appeal to fans of At The Gates,Dark Angel,In Flames and Testament."
5,Thrash Metal lives on!!!,"If you want a brutal assault of death/thrash metal than look no further than The Haunted's ""One Kill Wonder"". This album starts out with an excellent guitar riff intro and then breaks into the thrash metal madness. Many of the guitar riffs sound like they came straight from the library of Slayer although heavier and more brutal than anything Slayer ever did. Also, this band takes a more death metal oriented feel to their thrash metal, and you can definitely tell these guys are Swedish, as they contain many similarities to other Swedish death metal bands. The best song on this album is ""Shadow World""."
5,withouta dout!,"This is just one of the best bands I've recently found thanks to Amazon reasonable prices & availability. Also the reviews give me idea of what to expect. The Haunted has to b one of the best unknown bands ever. I are much more than just hardcore metal, they mix it up with real singing & the best off the wall break Downs! Im so glad they found me & im sill searching for bands like them. Thanks Amazon - Bull moose. Y'all Rock Hall 5+ stars for sure"
5,All the people that critic,"This Album is good and I don't why people critic that is not better than this and that man this album is good and that is. All the band are different that other that why genger them like trash if you live in the past lisent metallica, Ozzy,Scorpion guns & Roses that is so dead now. All the band Are good Slayer, Arch Enemy, Nevermore ETC.. So the band that you have to critic you don't do it like LP, korn,Limp B,New found Glory,Hoobastand all this crap is what kill metal now. Well This CD is 5 Star so buy it if you don't like it don't. So don't critic your Music Style because if you do Metal is gonna be dead Soon."
5,Nostalgic,"I recieved this dvd box set as a gift and I love it. I already have the complete fisrt season on dvd and loved it as well. It brought me back to my childhood. I grew-up watching Fraggle Rock as well as other Jim Henson creations, but this World he created called ""Fraggle Rock"" is my ultimate favorite. Not only is it fun to watch for little ones but for those you grew-up watching them in the 80's. Highly recommend!"
3,Second Season,"This was a pretty good product, the box was worn and a little damaged, but att the dvd's were there :)"
4,A Preview on fond memories,"With Episodes like Wembley's Egg, The Trash Heap doesn't live here anymore, and Boober's Dream it is where Fraggle Rock really starts to hit it's stride.I'm looking forword to getting a copy as soon as I can.Pass the Doozer Sticks, they built a new tower behind you and Enjoy."
2,Very poor quality book . . . .,"I breed fancy mice for a hobby, and bought this book as part of my mouse book collection. It is, by far, the poorest book ever written for the mouse owner. It just has the bare basics for mouse care, and sometimes not even that. Anyone just getting a mouse for a pet will be a little confused by this book, and I was ( and I have experience with mice!) In short, there are other books out there that are better! Don't waste your money."
2,Quick Read,I gave this book 2 stars because I couldn't relate to the book at all. The book didn't really hold my attention and I think that's why I didn't like it. I would recommend this book to a girl probably because I think a girl could relate to the book better then guys can.
3,Wish they were poseable,"I'm a child therapist and I ordered this set to have a more diverse doll collection for the children with whom I work. It's great that there are 8 family members since so many extended family members are actively involved in a child's life. I work with children aged 3 and up. Many children have been disappointed that the figures don't move. It's a great set, just wish they were flexible/posable/movable in some way."
4,Great German band - doing it in three languages,Such A Surge has more to offer than crossover music. If you understand German (most of the CD is in German language) you'll love the social-critic lyrics that make you think. Other songs are in English and in French - not a bit worse than the other songs on Under Pressure. Pour toujours is my favorite track of this SAS CD. I didn't grant 5 stars just because there is no absolutely superb fantastic all-time evergreen on this record :)
4,This book is beautiful,Sloan has put together beautiful photographs of a wide range of decorative styles and made her book that more interesting by approaching her subject from the point of view of a present-day practitioner of this (underappreciated!) art form. It will be interesting to the craftsperson but also to anyone who appreciates the beauty of decorative painting and its extraordinary variety thoughout different cultures and throughout the ages.
5,Absolutely amazing,"Thomas Ligotti is one of the best horror fiction authors of our time. I have read this book cover-to-cover, and even reread many stories. The imagery he paints with words is simply surreal and quite breath taking. Read his work, and you'll be quite pleased."
3,Lovecraft + Poe = Ligotti,"That basically sums up this book. It is well written yet i did not find the stories quite as terrifying as they were suggested to be. Not quite as good as Lovecraft, maybe not even as good as Derleth but definately worth a look all the same"
5,"Retired Air Force officer, Kunsan City, South Korea","This book is of great value in the sense that it is a piece of living history. I've lived here in Kunsan for a few years and this book really enlightened me about a few things. The dirt road to Kunsan is now a four-lane highway; the levee he describes in the book is still there; the dependent housing he built used to be the old ROKAF NCO houses (now deserted); and the base roads are basically the same routes as in 1947. Yes, things change, but at the same time they remain the same. I loved the book. Thanks, Fred."
1,"not Joseph murphy voice, poor american accent","might be good for americans, quite annoying for all other english speakers i would imagine. Guy speaks super fast and difficult to get into it."
3,The Power of Your Subconscious Mind.,I got a lot of innformation out of it. But I need to read one more time too review more of it. Hard to understand the first time.
3,Where is #1?,"Magical Egypt - Episode 1: The Invisible ScienceThis wasn't bad, but Ancient Aliens and other series and pieces are far better. Unfortunately, I am addicted to the concept of alternative archaeology, simply because accepted theories don't dig deep enough and everything points to far higher technology in terms of rock carving, moving and building. For whatever reason, the traditional theories fall short. The more I see of Zahi Hawass, the more I think his title should be Minister of Propaganda.This is just one small addition to the evidence that is currently massing to disprove human history as we know it, or religious fundamentalists want to believe."
4,An Anniversary to Remember: Years One to Seventy-Five,"I liked the anniversary meanings for each year and the gift suggestions. If the couple wants to celebrate with a party, there are ideas for that too."
1,Amertac Ceiling Hook,I selected this hook for its contemporary design and its rated capacity of 50 lbs. This hook failed during installation but I can't know if this is an inherently weak design or if this single hook was faulty and missed production QA checks. I am gratefull that it failed while screwing it onto its mounting bolt rather after placing it into service with a 30 lb light fixture suspended from it. I returned the item and made another selection which is in place and doing fine.
1,Pretty bad,I ordered this DVD for my mother as a gift for Christmas and she was not at all pleased! Most of the songs were alright but the quality of the video itself was terrible. I would've saved my money and bought something else for her if I knew she was going to be this dissatisfied.
1,Poor quality,"The range of sizes was very impressive and I was anxious to get a set with the larger sizes as well. When the set arrived many of the bits had come out of their storage area, so I was checking them closely to make sure none were damaged in shipping. I discovered many bits with voids in the shanks and even on the cutting edges from extremely poor forging. Many of the bits were not ground properly and no sharp cutting edge had been formed. Overall, the set of bits I received were the poorest quality I've ever seen from any supplier! The good news is I called MLCS and told them about the quality issue and they immediately gave me instructions for returning the set. My account was credited with the refund the day they received the bits.Extremely poor copy of the product, but excellent customer support."
2,broken box,"I received it with broken box, i had to fix it, the items inside was not damage that's the whole pointthnx any way"
3,good deal,"they arent going to cut like the more expensive bits. but for the price, its a good way to have all the sizes. i keep a better bit in the sizes i use often, and try to use this just occasionally."
5,Great Story. Beautiful Writing,"I disagree with the previous review. I think this book was wonderful, the relationship that developed between Merrick and Alyssa was beautiful. The feelings between them were intense and real. I wont give a description since it's already on the page but I will say this, I am adding Day Leclaire to my favourite authors list. I loved this book and can't wait for the rest of the series to come out. I just picked up the Prince's Mistress and it was excellent I definetly reccomend it, and the next story is the Royal Wedding Night. This series is turning out to be wonderful and I hope this review will help anyone who decides to check out this book before buying. I mean who doesn't love an Alpha male with a heart of gold who's completely in love with the female lead as well as the hot hot hot love scenes. Wow Wow Wow couldn't put it down."
4,The Forbidden princess,"I also disagree with the first review. The book was well done with a believable story. True, Alyssa is kidnapped because the man she is to marry is forcing her to do so by holding her mother captive. And Merrick is trying to stop the wedding because the groom is tring to gain the crown thru deception. If he marries Alyssa, he controls two of the three principalities that vote in the new king. But is Merrick doing so just for his ouwn family's gain? Read and find out. This was a very enjoyable book. I am now reading the second in the series and expect to enjoy it also."
4,Practices are too similar to each other,"I bought this 4 pack DVD set because it was such a good deal and I thought that I would rotate between the four DVDs through the week. The instruction on this video is awesome, some of the best I have seen on yoga DVDs. The other aspects of the DVD (set, music, etc) are also very appealing. My only complaint about this (and why I didn't rate 5 stars) is that I feel the videos are too similar to each other. They are the same poses, but in a different order. The Fire DVD is the best, it gives a great cardio work-out as well as a great yoga session. But, how can you not buy all 4 DVDs when it is so cheap? But just be warned, they are pretty similar to each other."
5,Perfect set of DVDs,This is perfect for beginner or advanced person. Challenging yet relaxing. At a good balance of yoga exercises!
5,Among the best Yoga DVDs Ever!,"I trained with Tracy and Ganga at White Lotus and they are gifted teachers. While I practice other styles of yoga as well, (Shiva Rea's flow yoga and the Ashtanga Primary Series), I always find myself gravitating back to this series of DVDs. They are balanced, complete practices emphasizing all the categories of postures (standing postures, forward bends, backbends, twists, inversions, balancing). This set contains 4 practice DVDs - allowing you to progress according to your own individual level. Earth - beginners; Water - advanced beginner; Fire - intermediate (good one to get that heart rate up); Total Yoga - good all around practice for most levels. You won't be disappointed. And the price simply cannot be beat."
5,nicola di bari-Il meglio,"I cannot give a review at this time because I have not purchased the CD as yet but I intend to do it because I just love Nicola. I grew up listening to him. I love the italian language and Nicola di Bari is great.I would like to respond to the fan who gave this CD a 4 because Erba di cas mia was not part of it. Well, let me inform you that you can buy all the CDs by Nicola di Bari but you will not find that song because it is sang by Massimo Ranieri. So, please get your italian singers straight. Massimo is also good, and if you like italian music, try Gianni Morandi, Fabrizio de Andre and Sergio Endrigo and Umberto Tozzi, Zuchero and Eros Ramzotti just to mention a few."
4,EVO dog food,"A little confusing because they tell you they'll ship in two shipments (I received two separate notices saying the product would go out on two separate dates), but then you get one package only. Great dogfood, but I found that it's cheaper to buy it at my local pet shop."
2,Could Have Been Better,"There's some good material in here, more appealing possibly to the causal aviation enthusiast than a real aviation enthusiast. A tour de force in stretching a small amount of aircraft footage into a feature length DVD - don't expect extended sequences of ground or aerial manoeuvres. Frequent interjections by the narrator talking over nothing more that a title page for tens of seconds gives the impression of padding the material out, and I think this would be a correct view since there is precious little information imparted in these padding sequences. The 'which is the best' trump card approach really wouldn't I believe appeal to a true aviation enthusiast - which is the best fighter aircraft for example exercises a rather purile discussion - if you're really into aircraft this DVD set is gloss with no substance."
5,Just Perfect,"This is the best solo almbum released by Vitalij. The music style is a bit different from other albums, he uses more variations per songs and much vivid rythmes. Jon Doman has played the drums in the previos albums but in this one he was...inspired? I don't know why he didn't play like that before, his drum solo in the first track left me without words. Tony MacAlpine gave something I think the previos almbums lacked:Feeling. He may not be as virtuose as George Bellas(guitar on second album which is Extreme Measures), but he plays with the heart and with incredible precition, I personaly think that any other guitar player could not have expresed such passion as Tony MacAlpine. Finaly Vitalij Kuprij shows how he has evolved giving us the perfect song: Alternate Diversion. The violin part playing simultaneously with the guitar and piano was a master piece. Just Perfect."
3,What can I do with my iPod?,"A lot, with suggestions from this little book published by O'Reilly Media. Suggestions for third-party hardware, freeware and shareware programs to make the most of the iPod, and a lot more. At $14.95, this is the basic book for iPod users to have on their bookshelf."
3,Cheap but iffy for a MST3K episode,"Space ranger Rocky Jones (Richard Crane) and sidekick Winky (Scotty Beckett) are on a mission to covert peace between two moons that will soon crash into each other and try to take them to a new planet where peace can reign.This movie is basically 3 episodes of ""Rocky Jones"" joined in one as for the time it did had good but now cheap effects and the acting is quite bad i'm afraid, it's a good thing MST3K riffed this movie even if it's one of their weakest episodes."
5,This is sure to become a beginning reader classic.,"The illustrations are a delight and there is just enough text to keep ""beginning beginners"" going.Tiny and his owner have great adult as well as kid appeal. I haven't been this pleased about a book at this level in years, and I've seen a great many. (A kindergarten teacher in WA state.)"
5,The Complete Green Letters,I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in growing to the fullness of God through Jesus Christ the Lord.
5,My #1 Favorite Book,Changed my Life. Jesus Paid it all. Check out my other favorite life changers. Feel free to email me.
1,Long wait for nothing,I ordered a book for a friend who is in a detention center. The book could not be accepted by the center because JW books wasn't a qualified distributor. I was refunded the price of the book but they got me for the delivery. I'll never use that company again. This is my first bad experience with Amazon. I waited over 30 days and my friend was totally disappointed. Good bye JW Books. :-(
4,www.reneasbooklist.blogspot.com,"The Green Letters is about spiritual growth. It's one of those books you can pick and choose what you want to read by scanning over the Table of Contents; that is, the chapters don't necessarily have to be read in order. This book will challenge you to live less selfishly, or we could say, less as a self-follower and more as a Christ-follower."
4,Plan book for modern victorian homes,"As a builder, I get pretty tired of the same old plans in the same old plan books. This collection, and others by Home Planners, offers some beautifully modernized versions of Queen Anne , Romanesque, Gothic and Folk Victorian homes from three different architectural design firms. All 160 of the plans are available for purchase from Home Planners. Well worthwhile for anyone planning to build a victorian home"
1,substitute latch,Product received not as pictured. My originallatch looks like picture. Product shipped is not the same.Question whether it will work
4,Much more entertaining than most books on Christian living,"I am a big fan of Leonard Sweet. He may just be a modern day prophet. He sees things that others don't see, writes them down, and makes us all say to ourselves, ""How did we not see that before?"" This is by far the most enjoyable book I've ever read on Christian living. However, I would say that Sweet's style and ideas seem to better fit his earlier subjects on ministry and the christian church as a whole. Nevertheless, Sweet still manages to create a book on this subject that is much more innovative than that of his contemporaries."
2,Nothing spectacular,"After reading a lot of reviews about Zojirushi, I decided to buy this product from Amazon for one main reason.The description said Made in Japan. Unfortunately, it turned out to be false advertising by Amazon. The product is actually Made in China and it shows in the finish. It feels very plastic and almost about to break.The carafe is nothing special either. Just like any regular vacuum lined container and it does a basic job of keeping liquids hot for about 3 hours. Not more than that..Well it serves the purpose. But is costly for the Made in China label and the 3 hr lifetime of hot liquids."
2,Not For Me,"I don't understand how this book could keep readers laughing. A chuckle here and there is all I could manage. The stories have very ""light"" romance almost no sex, which I can't fault any writer for leaving out if that is her style. However, something else has to work and nothing worked for me. The characters were completely forgettable, which is why I have not gone into any details. Just thinking about them makes me want to kick myself for buying this book. Save your money. For over $10 it is much too expensive for a rehash of stories that lack any meaningful content, excitement or romance. A touch of humor is all that keeps me from giving this 1 star."
3,Short stories aren't Kurland's strong suit,"I bought this book because I am a big fan of Ms. Kurland's de Piaget love stories and wanted to read about the other members of the family. However, I prefer the stories that don't involve time travel--This is All I Ask is one of the sweetest and most romantic stories I've ever read. These stories were too short for Kurland's style. She is at her best when she delves deeply into emotionally scarred characters who are healed through the love they never expected. The short story format simply does not give Ms. Kurland enough time to develop those emotions. These stories all left me feeling like the best parts were edited out to fit the format. What a shame. These characters deserved better."
3,Some missing information here,"First off, let me apologize because this isn't a proper review. But I didn't see any other way to pose these questions. The editorial review above states there are 8 films in this collection, including at least one featuring Boris Karloff. But there are only SIX movies listed on the cover, and Karloff isn't in any of them. This page needs to be revised to reflect an accurate list of what's in this set.For the record, my 3-star rating isn't just arbitrary. I have seen two of the films listed here, and they were quite entertaining. THE SMILING GHOST is a terrific haunted house comedy, and SH! THE OCTOPUS is a silly but breezy little mystery film with some mild horror elements.I'll be glad to remove or revise my review once I have more accurate information to let me decide whether or not to pick it up. If anyone else has it already, please post a review or some comments here."
3,Very B films,"Warner Bros. dug the bottom of the barrel for these films. Picture quality is okay but story content is rather dull. ANN SHERIDAN, the main reason I bought this set lacks her OOMPH. The nurses uniforms in both films do litte to enhance her glamor image, nor does she have any saucy lines to deliver."
5,Loved it!,I loved this book. Read it for the holidays and it was a touching story of love and family and devotion to ones parents.
3,Kind of a disappointment,"This was the fourth qm book I read. I was expecting it to help me make the transition from quantum mechanics to quantum chemistry, but it didn't quiet succeed in doing so. As for QM there exist better books than this (eg Sakurai) and for QChem, I found Szabo's book to be much more better (with less of fundamentals and directly going towards applications)RegardsPurushottam"
3,Not The Book I expected!,"I bought this book thinking it was a reprint of Dr. Paulings earlier book on Quantum Mechanics that was published in 1935. The original book had a blue cover and was more oriented towards an introductory book on Quantum Mechanics/ However, when I received this book I found it focused more on the chemistry rather than the physics side of the science.I still am looking for the original book that was also published in 1935.Ron Feltman EE"
2,Cute but pull is a bit noisy,Very cute. The on-off tug pull is NOISY and takes effort and might wake up the baby!
3,fits my needs,I needed a basket for my walker to put my purse or other items. This was just what I needed.
4,Invacare walker basket,"My husband got this for me after my knee surgery. We chose this model because,after research, we felt it would be the best ""fit"" to go with our Invacare folding walker (2 paddle closer mechanism with 2 bar front). We chose this walker because we felt it was quite sturdy. I really like the walker & the basket. The basket ""snaps"" on/off in moments and is quite secure when on. It meets my needs well except I wish they would make a stable cup holder that could be attached inside the basket. A walker requires two hands so dealing with cups & food is challenging. I put my food in tupperware containers and they fit nicely in the basket but I wasn't albe to find a good solution for the cup problem. When I wanted my items in the basket to be more private (when going out) I just put them in a purse or tote; problem solved."
3,At Least it Fits,"We had need for a walker for a short time at our house. The hospital provided an Invacare walker, which our insurance would pay for. The Invacare walker has a different front profile from most, so I could not just buy a one-size-fits-most generic basket. This basket fits the Invacare walker fine, but it only comes in the open basket style shown. Knowing what we now know, I'd prefer to be able to use one of those canvas/nylon baskets so small articles don't fall out, and the world doesn't see what is in your basket. But this Invacare basket fits snugly, so we used it.Would not recommend the walker or the basket, for the reasons mentioned. But it works ok. I would not choose this brand if I had to use a walker for a long time.Shipper was fast, and packed it beautifully. The fault is in the walker itself."
4,Good Poster,"This product came exactly as desribed. It's one of those large movie posters you would see at a movie theater. My only criticism is that the original Mighty Ducks movie is so cool, but this poster is not on the same level. Gordon Bombay looks pretty sweet, but the kids in the back are kinda lame. Wish they made one that featured the ducks in their classic green jerseys."
4,You're a divine animal,"Seized by police in 1966 for violating state obscenity laws, The Love Book is a holy ode to sex. But not just any sex -- loving sex, divine sex. (I think I read that she had been studying Tibetan buddhism &/or tantra.) She was a student of buddhism, and she embraced the ""divine animal.""The book is very short, only 6 pages long, and it consists of only four poems.The entirety of The Love Book is now available in theCollected Poems of Lenore Kandel.Fans of the beats or of raw, honest, ""holy erotica"" will probably enjoy these poems."
4,"find the real ""career"" you",After being in the work force 24 years there is much tolearn in Customize Your Career. Ms. Usheroff helps you definewhere you are without negativity yet inspires honesty in how toview where you are and how you arrived there. The key is sheshows you how to move on by taking you from your own inside world to the reality of the outside world.I have recommended this book to those who are employed andunemployed. It is a life lesson for all.
4,TERRIFIC !!!!,KUDOS ON DEFINING AND REFINING YOURSELF TO BE WHO YOU CAN BE!!THIS BOOK MAKES YOU THINK..ALL FOR THE POSITIVE.A MUST READ FOR THOSE AT CAREER CROSSROADS.
4,Keep it in the family . . .,"Not bad at all - although not necessarily riveting, it does keep your interest. Father, Brothers, Daughters UNITE in killing whatever your fancy! A lovely and twisted ending - this will stay in the collection."
1,A big mess,"Born Killers is a fraudulent imitation. It tries to be a conciousless suspense in the vein of Natural Born Killers, but is lacking in a message or a sense of humor which is necessary to pull of this kind of movie. Its completely devoid of character development and plot. Lauren German is the only reason I give it one star. Her character had promiss but was probably left on the cutting room floor. There was just too much to swallow that made no sense. Incest? Why? I love the heartless, cold, break all taboos genre but this one fell short."
3,I Completed It But Remained Perplexed,"I agree with another reviewer that a good editor would have reined in the characters and the wobbling plot. At times the storyline was realistic and then it would ask your permission to believe farfetched occurrences, such as a full fledge photo shoot with personnel out the wazoo was put together overnight. Yes, we're reading fiction but not fairytales. The unit of people, including Tracy, seemed to function more like a business and not a family that has a member that's been kidnapped. KIDNAPPED mind you. . . all I can say is poor Marisa. This book is good for any student, writer, author, to read as an exercise on how to edit and/or restructure. Neri's a popular writer and I look forward to reading one of her books from another mystery series."
2,VERY Cheap Bag,"Everything about these bags is cheap -- the zippers, the unwoven-cloth lining, the padding, the workmanship, the design. It's about on par with the bags that chain music stores have during sales for ten or fifteen bucks.I bought two of these for a couple of classicals I have and they were tight on the upper bout with one guitar and tight on the lower bout with the other. As the zipper on one was already sprung right out of the box, I am hesitant to put much load on it. The zipper pulls are the flimsiest I've seen on anything in a long time. The padding is supposedly 20mm, but it is very low-density and insubstantial.I got these mostly to just insulate the guitars from fluctuations in room temperature and humidity indoors, and I suppose they are adequate for that purpose, but beyond that I have my doubts."
4,not too scary,"I think this movie was good for the age group it is geared for. No scary monsters or anything just kind of creepy situations, suspense, that kind of thing. Perfect for halloween. My 5 1/2 year old enjoys goosebumps and for her, she can tolerate most of the goosebumps series as long as we are with her watching them, of course (no nightmares either). She has her older friends, 7 and 10 years old hooked on them. Can't say all kids would enjoy these series. If your child likes harmless scary movies then they will like goosebumps movies because most episodes are about 1/2 each (usually 2 episodes to a dvd)so just enough time to keep the attention span and the situations are not over the top. My daughters' friends also say that some of them teach you lessons in life. Well, maybe some of them do..."
3,lovely,"Did not care for the buffa pieces, but Julianne Baird's voice is a revelation of grace and light weight virtuosity, & she has some arias w gravitas. Surprise of a beautiful flute concerto in the middle."
2,A Biased View of Philosophy,"""The One Minute Philosopher"" is marketed as a sort of quick and easy guide to abstract philosophical terms; while this is true, Dr. Brown presents exclusively a Christian view. Large gaps in logic are common in his writing, and he states some ideas as absolute when they are in fact merely speculative. Brown is an obviously partial author, infusing his book with blatantly one-sided judgments. He is not giving the reader in-depth definitions; his rather shallow explanations are overly simplistic. ""The One Minute Philosopher"" might be better called ""One Minute Guide to Catholic Thought"". In fact, the Sophia Institute Press, which publishes an edition of the book, praised the work's usefulness ""To get a hearing for Catholic truth and values today"". Buy this book not to gain a more profound understanding of major concepts but to learn the Catholic view of them."
5,Brilliant!,An essential reference book on how to craft almost all of the golden dawn magical tools for ritual work-a rare find indeed.Included are detailed instructions on correct painting schemes and correct sizes for each implement or accessory to make your Golden Dawn Temple as authentic looking as possible.The tools and robes and other implements follow Israel regardies lineage of Golden dawn practice.this book is a must for the Golden dawn practitioner or serious magical historian...
4,Fast,Arrived quickly and in good shape thank you!!!!! This book has answered allot of questions and has given a better understanding of the various parts each level has in construction and maintenance of the initiation rites and of the large armada of tools needed for a physical temple etc.... I do not see this for someone who started the path in the past week to begin with either.Nick
1,Get Writer's Market online,"Get writer's market online.It has a database that allows you to filter results from all the writer's market books and is kept up to date.It's four bucks a month and will save you hundreds of hours of flipping through the various WM books.You also get thousands of pages worth of articles, rather than just the handful they picked out for the paper books."
4,Writers Market-Wow,"I am someone just starting out as a freelance writer, so my knowledge base is that of a novice. I found this book to be great. Tons of information, not just on magazines, but the process on how to get published. A great buy."
3,Could have been better,"Not as up to date like the older versions, the popular magazines have no contact info. Should just buy the 2003 edition."
2,Not for fiction novelists.,"Larger than 2004 edition, but lists only 50 agents. One must purchase the Guide to Literary Agents or pay significantly more to gain access to their website to get more agent listings.The publisher listings are all but worthless for anyone writing adult fiction novels (especially mystery/suspense,) as virtually no quality publishing firm will accept unsolicited manuscripts. The few listed that do are either e-publishing or very small firms that only publish 6-12 novels per year.I don't know whether there are more publishers and magazines listed in the Novel and Short Story Writer's Market. If so, it would be a better purchase. If not, why print it in addition to this book?My money would have been better spent purchasing the agents' guide or even simply joining their website."
5,A must-have for every writer,"No writer's going to make a penny unless he knows where to submit his work. The Writer's Market is a absolute essential on every working writer's bookshelf, and it's highly recommended that writers update their version each year when the new edition comes out, because the market is always changing."
4,Worthy update of the first edition,"A long-awaited update of the 1989 first edition. Professional chemists should seriously consider updating to this edition, if they found the previous one useful. Many sections have substantial additions, as you'd expect in any science over such a time.But the authors have also added entire new sections. On lab safety. Perhaps they'd earlier assumed that this was outside the book's scope? Other new material covers electrophoresis and electroanalysis. These fields have seen significant work in the past decade. Also, job-wise, many chemists might have responsibilities in these areas, and the book tries to reflect this."
1,Force Commander Forced Me To Quit,"With its huge requirements and slow speed, I wonder how you could play past the first few missions without pulling your hair out. Later missions are nearly impossible. The best thing I can think of is that you can bang your forehead against a hard object for about 20 minutes while you wait for it to load a saved game."
5,Louise J. Kaplan,"For a woman to explore and express the fullness of her sexuality, her emotional and intellectual capacities, would entail who knows what risks and who knows what truly revolutionary alteration of the social conditions that demean and constrain her.Or she may go on trying to fit herself into the order of the world and thereby consign herself forever to the bondage of some stereotype of normal femininity - a perversion, if you will.Louise J. KaplanI gave this DVD 5 stars because I liked the movie."
4,Female Perversions,"At times it was very hard to follow, but I believe that is actually what the writer intended. It was entertaining and of good quality. Not really my cup of tea. I like a more upbeat storyline."
3,.,"I give this movie real credit for the potency with which it portrays the psychological difficulties and dangers of being a woman in a society that prefers its women to be magazine-clipped dolls of aesthetic perfection, even as it criticizes itself for this. The neurotic hallucinations are quite affecting at times, and Eve is a fascinating character. However, although effective in these ways, this *is* a very pretentious-feeling film; and although I sympathize with intelligent feminism readily enough, this is very much a ""feminist"" film -- and any piece of art that is so directly interwined with a social movement, even if that social movement is a valid one, can only be so entertaining in my eyes, as I am not a fan of films that are clearly preaching, and are overly preoccupied with their own social agenda."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZ,"A slow Saturday. Rented this video because it was a ""Sundance"" film which won critical praise. That usually indicates a film worth seeing. I sat through the whole thing waiting for it to take off. It never did. Boring. Boring. Boring."
1,Don't bother,After fast forwarding this film I threw it in the bin.What a waste of time and money.Tilda Swinton is not attractive in the slightest and for the film to make out that she is is ludicrous.The title is completely misleading.
2,Slow and boring,"When I read the description of the book, it sounded interesting and sexy. The mystery was dull, the romance was so so slow you have to almost read 3/4 of the book before that happens. I understand Ms. Linz wants to portrait the librarian as conservative, but this is ridiculous unless she's in her 70's. Unfortunately, it doesn't make me want to read any of her other books."
3,Not her best work,"I love Cathie's books, this had to have been her earlier work. I kept waiting for it to get better. There was the hint of characters developing- and then .... wow, nothing. Her other books had me laughing out loud, Im just not sure what happened here."
1,"So many mistakes, too expensive at free","I kept waiting for someone to say trick or treat. How could this woman be portrayed as a typical librarian, the most liberal group of people ever met. Writing very uneven."
1,Disappointing,This was recommended by an author I 'like' on Facebook and I bought on the strengh of that recommendation. What a huge disapointment. Lack-lustre storyline with truly awful writing (adverbs everywhere!). Avoid it at all possible.
5,What a joy,I read this book when it first came out....and it went immediately on my keeper shelf. I love Cathie Linz' humor and characters--her dialog is always such fun--and this one was an extra delight to see available in Kindle form.A fast read...a super read....and just a feel-good-all-day read. Don't miss!
2,Weak and flimsy,"I do not know if it is the fault of the seller or a problem with the packaging, but my order did not come with the lid. This product is also very flimsy. Luckily I only need the bottom/stem portion to replace the Coleman one that had come apart otherwise the missing lid would be a bit of an issue. The bottom does worry me though because after gently cleaning it the stem still requires some re-bending for adjustment and that will not last. This will hold me over until I purchase a better percolator but it won't last long. Also it is a bit temperamental if the water begins to expand too vigorously as the assembly is so light that it is easily shoved off to the side by the churning water causing the percolation to stop."
1,The complete guide to hunting wild boar in California,"I'd say save your money. More, and up to date info can be found on the web. The guy poses with the same exact hog with 4-5 different weapons in the book, it's really cheesy. Too much is dedicated to private land hunting. Too basic for anyone who's spent any time afield."
3,Not bad for a first novel,"2 1/2 stars. I was only reading this because I've decided to go back and read all of Kristin Hannah's books and this is the first one she published. The story was ok, not great. I had a hard time relating to the inner turmoil felt by the two main characters which meant there were times I felt myself frustrated by the interaction between them. This is the second book I've read by Hannah and I definitely liked the other one (Between Sisters) a lot better. But, for a first book, it's not too bad. I was able to read through it quickly enough to be satisfied. The main thing I disliked about the book is the overuse of curse words. They felt unnecessarily abrasive. I understand that they were used to show Stone Man's abrasive personality, but to me, vulgarity is a cheap way to express a point. I'm hoping that as I continue through Hannah's later works I will see that her talent to creatively express such ideas has improved with practice."
3,Book i ordered,I like to read Kristin Hannah and was looking for the above book. I paid $19+ for the book and was quite shocked and upset when I received the paperback book 261 pages and across the top of the book read SPECIAL VALUE $2.99. I think that is so wrong to charge a person that much of a difference. I will not order any future books and get ripped off again.I wonder if they would buy it back from me for a good amount!!!!!!!!!
3,Attacking the Tirpitz,"I purchased this video out of curiosity. I had read a Reader's Digest ""condensed book"" version of the story of the British attempt to sink the Tirpitz. That was circa late 70's or very early 80's and I don't remember the details of that written story except that it was titled ""Twelve Against The Tirpitz"" and involved a number of tiny submarines and was fascinating reading. This movie version of the story is a bit dry and, if you don't know the background history of the Tirpitz and the attempts to sink her, is likely to be somewhat confusing and disjointed. I'd recommend watching this movie only if you first read the historical data about the Tirpitz as available on wikipedia or some other source."
2,My copy is NOT subtitled,I have a profound hearing loss and only purchase DVDs that are close captioned or subtitled. I have this film in front of me and have tried to run it all 4 of my DVD players... there are no CCs or subtitles on this film. I can look at the pictures but not having dialog takes just a tad off John Mills performance. I tried to amend the product discription but Amazon wants proof other than my having spent money on a film I can't watch. I could return it but it's not worth the hassle. So I'll just let other know here.
1,Region 2,I was a dope and did not read thoroughly enough.. Now I can't watch it.You can only view with a Euro DVD player
1,"buy the Canadian Brass, but don't buy this CD","The Canadian Brass are wonderful, but spend your money on one of their other CDs. First, the amount of music is only 32 minutes. Second, almost 8 minutes of it is a piece of ""music"" (term used loosely) by Norman Symonds called ""A Diversion"". I think the ""diversion"" means you have to divert your hand to find the CD remote so you can skip this track -- it is not worth listening to!So, buy the Canadian Brass, but don't buy this CD!"
2,Extremely lame.,"I needed to buy something cheap to reach the threshold for free shipping on an order. This was the perfect price, and I am somewhat of an English nerd, so I ordered it. A large portion is simply a catalog of children's thoughtless word choices or ambiguous quotes and headlines that could be misinterpreted in an amusing way. If that's what you want, great, but I recommend you find a new medium on which to predicate your sense of humor. It is the ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" of word choice in book form. Good Lord. My amusement quickly waned and interest vanished after a few pages. This book is so boring that I couldn't even bring myself to read it at the toilet. It is unremarkable enough that I don't remember how I got rid of it, but thank god I did. If someone were to discover this in my bookshelf, I would likely take both our lives out of embarrassment."
4,New Take on Biographies,"This is a humorous and witty book written from the viewpoint of a biography on someone that is not famous. It makes the point that we may know everything there is to about Lincoln, but do we know how he liked his eggs. The characters are alive, and you truly feel sorry for the simplicity of the subjects life. Botton, a Swiss native, is a master of British humor... and many funny moments come through on the page as he writes the definitive biography of Isabel Rogers. It is a book that really does a great job of poking fun at biographers and what they must do in order to capture the essence of a person. Worthy read, and the author is worth reading again."
4,Los Palominos are awesome!!,"I usually don't like 'Norteno' kind of music, but LOS PALOMINOS have made me change my mind. I love all of their songs!"
5,"Anthem, Jerry Loeb","I really enjoyed this book. It was full of suspense down to the last page. It amazed me to learn that it was published BEFORE 9/11. The characters amost jump out of the pages and I couldn't help thinking what a great movie thriller this would make. The scary part is when one wonders whether this plot could really happen. Also, I learned a vast number of 21st Century acronyms having to do with aviation and the military. Great book."
2,opened candy wrappers,all the individual wrappers were open (not sealed correctly). not sure if its safe to eat (the box was wrapped in plastic as well).
1,Thanks for nothing.,"This book was a bore. This Robinson fella doesn't know Mary Kay from Adam, and has never spoken a work to her-and it's evident!The book was a half star in my opinion. A total waste of money."
1,This is bullshit!,I refuse to rate this movie or say more - saying this film is bullshit is just doing it a favor.
4,perfectly pink,"I thought this perfectly pink ring was going to be too large a stone for my hand , but it is totaly perfect. I love it ! I wear it every day. I did not give it five stars, because I have already broken a prong. I just bought it in April. This ring makes me feel perfectly pretty in pink."
5,Sterling Silver with Pink Cubic Zirconia Ring,Excellent value. The ring is very nice and the vendor shipped super fast. I will buy from this vendor again.
1,Don't buy this camera.,"This camera is a waste of your good money. The images are grainy and washed out. It is very sensitive to light, resulting in white faces and poor contrast. To top it all off, the camera seems to randomly delete photos as I take additional photos, and not because the memory is short.To further complicate things, the software is klunky and doesn't always connect to the camera properly. The camera is manufactured by Jazz Photo. Neither Bell + Howell nor Jazz Photo seem to provide support for this camera or the software. Do not buy this camera."
5,mom and grandma,"I use these on my grandchildren and within a minute, they forget they have an insect bite. When checked later, cannot find any sign of stings. Works super!!!"
1,A Very Uninspiring Read.,I purchased this book last week based on its interesting premise after reading about it on amazon.com. It was a complete waste of time. The main character was uninteresting; the plot was incredibly slow --- the other characters were a complete mish-mash of random characters introduced for no reason. It felt as if the author had fallen asleep in writing this and didn't really care or plan where he was taking the reader. I am impressed only that anyone could finish this book (I regret that I did) or find any enjoyment from it. I wish I could get a refund for time ill-spent.
1,Do I have to credit this book with a star?,"This book is hideous. I got halfway through it before I realized that something this bad is never going to get any better. I flipped to the end and saw that it was just as bad. I cannot describe how disturbing I found this book. It is NOT going on my shelf any time soon.The main character is a loser, and I really didn't like any of the characters in the book. The prospect of using science to study religion is the only potentially good part. From there on and before that, it is highly disturbing. I suggest that you DO NOT read this book."
2,"Starts with a bang, ends in a whimper","I had mixed feelings when I picked up this book, but wanted to give it a try. In the beginning, I was fascinated. Nasir has some great ideas in regards to science and religion and a very eloquent way of presentation. I really enjoyed how it got me to thinking and the conversations w/ my husband that it inspired. I was sucked in and hooked. Then the last third to half of the book started to lack greatly. I found myself not interested in it at all, but kept plugging away in the hopes Nasir would redeem himself and capture some of the magic from the beginning. I finished this book very disappointed, confused, and angry for wasting my time. To add injury to insult, all of his female characters were very 2 dimensional, weak, and outright cartoonish. This would have been better as a short story."
2,Disappointed,"I have an old Olympus 2.1 megapixel C-2100. It had a built in stabilization just like this Minolta Z5. Unfortunately, the built-in stabilizer option is about the only plus I can find for this Minolta.My pictures that I take using my 2.1 megapixel Olympus are night and day more vibrant in color than the ones taken with the Minolta.We are returning this camera to get our money back. We were excited about the stabilization feature, as it is a hard feature to find in a camera, but if it sacrifices picture quality, then it is not worth it."
2,Buyer Beware,I only had this Camera 6 months and the motor that runs the lens died. I wasn't all that good of a camera anyway compared to the Z1. The 12X zoom was what sold me on it in the first place. I spent a small fortune on this camera and now they want $175.00 more dollars to repair it. Egads!! I can by several good camera's for that much money. Please learn from my mistake.
3,Buy Canon S2 IS instead,"I have had other super zoom cameras from other brands. I kept this Z5 for 3 months only primarily for one reason: NoiseIn case you don't know what noise in photography means, it looks like random sand grain on a low-light photo. Konica Minolta Z5 is very very bad in terms of noise. Don't expect you can take anything decent with Z5 under in-door scenario without flash.Other features work fine, such as the anti-shake feature and long battery life (due to AA sized battery). However, the ultimate outcome of a camera is the image. If the image quality is bad (mentioned above), other nice features seem insignificant."
1,Locked-up,"As I took this out of the box and powered it up I immediately saw that it suffered from faulty programming. It was locked into the viewfinder mode and would not allow me to see anything through the LCD. Konica Minolta was of no help and simply said I should send it to them for repair - about a four week process for something that I had never used. Intuition told me that there should be some way to reboot the thing - but it was not to be. I bought this despite similar complaints that I had read on the web (one correspondent told of a vacation to Mexico being ruined by the inability to take pictures when this camera locked up). Well, they were right and I was wrong, so I returned it to Amazon.com without any problems and bought a Panasonic LZ2 which seems to be a good compromise between enhanced zoom and size. I will be taking that to Europe soon along with my old Fuji 2 megapixel as backup."
3,Ok vise,"A decent wood vise but there are some points to consider. The vise came with threaded holes to attach you own wood blocks - however the holes do not align from one jaw to the other, so you need to drill the holes for your wood blocks before you attach the vise to your work table - or you need to make a template for each jaw.Also, the casting of fixed jaw (the one that you screw into you table) had over an 1/8"" differene in thickness between the right and left sides. In order to mount the vise parallel to your work table, you'll need to check this out and shim appropriately.No taper on the jaws, so may cause uneven pressure under certain clampings."
1,Not what was advertised,"Buyer beware.What is pictured in the advertisement is Chicken Bouillon. What I was sent was Chicken FLAVORED Bouillon. These are two distinctly different products and review of theingredients on the packaging attests to that. I suspect Knorr does not make the genuine product anymore so I was happy to find it advertised on Amazon. But, the advertising is deceptive and theysubstituted chicken flavored bouillon (package in fact was in spanish).This was dishonest, something I am not used to on Amazon"
1,"Length is 11.5"", description said 9""","To clarify, leg itself is fine, beautiful. I bought it because the description said 9"" length. It is actually 11.5"" long."
3,Good Choice,"This DVD is important for the works chosen for presentation, the operas of Verdi which are underperformed in this country. Having said that, I found the sound had distortions during the orchestral crescendos and when the singers reached their upper ranges. I realize that when performing, there are good and bad days, for some on this DVD, they were not at their best vocally. Leo Nucci was there to sing with focus and passion, and so was a standout on this DVD. Senior Cura was casual in the first presentations but as the concert came to any end he had found his own passion and commitment to the arias. The comprimari singers gave great performances of their parts in all cases. Overall, a welcome addition to any collection."
3,sunglass review,I received the sunglasses I purchased in a timely fashion. They appear to be new and in good condition. The only negataive is that they fall off when I bend over to pick up somethng.
2,Fun for about 5 minutes,"My son loves everything Hot Wheels. So when he first saw this he was SO happy and excited. That lasted just a few minutes, unfortunately. There is not much to this set. The robot constantly falls off the set and comes apart when it shouldn't. My son played with this twice and each time just for a few minutes. Now it sits in his closet. :( I've found Hot Wheels products to be very hit or miss. Sometimes they're great and sometimes they're duds. This one is a dud... :("
5,Definitely worth a couple days of your spare time,"Great read by a great author. I would suggest this book to anyone who is planning to tackle the AT, or anyone who can find beauty and peace in a simple day hike. It's told quite differently than other thru-hiker books in that it is not a linear log of his journey, but a series of chapters that each cover a different aspect of the challenges and triumphs."
1,Pages Missing,At first it seemed all was well. The book appeared to be in good condition. Transaction was smooth and easy. I got half way through my course and realized that 2 pages had been torn out. One of them Page 376 was specific to my assignment. Luckily I was able to have a classmate scan the page and email it to me. The other page that was missing was part of my reading assignment. It was very disappointing. I learned my lesson about buying used.
1,This sucks!!,"These headphones are crap!! They dont stay in your ears and the sound is terrible. The only way to get good sound is to push them into your ears and hold them there, but it still sounds terrible. I bought the twenty dollar sonys and those are MUCH better. DO NOT buy this product unless you collect headphones or some crap like that."
5,"THIS BOOK WAS SO REAL, IT WAS EASY TO FEEL A PART OF IT.","I really enjoyed this book to the fullest. I checked it out from the library and was so wrapped up in it that I read it in 4 days! I am looking forward to the sequel! It is so sad that there are actually women out there in the world going through stuff like this. It makes you wonder why God would allow something like this to happen, but that shows that when things like this happen we need to trust in God and lean on him for help. God said he woldn't put on us more than we could bare. As long as we trust in him, he will see us through"
5,awesome,just what I wanted. it's been so helpful for walks here with all the hills....makes things just a little easier and they are super cool looking too
4,A Good Introduction to Bach and Schiff,"Pianist A. Schiff has established a presence in the classical arena in part by playing Bach's keyboard music on the piano. Reaction to his Bach performances ranges from enthusiastic praise to harsh critique. I'm not a specialist in Baroque music, although I do agree with detractors that his more recent CDs on Bach sound mannered. By contrast, this CD, made relatively earlier in Schiff's career (late 70s, I believe) sounds much less idiosyncratic and labored in handling the 3 suites. The music is closely recorded without sounding harsh, resulting in an overal crisp and direct rendition. The program is admirably balanced between the familiar (The Italian Concerto and the 5th French Suite) and the less accessible (The French Overture). Overall, a pleasant experience if you can resist comparing every interpretive detail with recording by Gould, Tureck, Hewitt, etc."
3,needs better fact checking,"This is a well written book. It is comprehensive yet not overwelming with detail. I am confused though how a journalist with Mr. Ferguson'snewapaper backgound would get some of the little facts WRONG! I am a member of the voluminous number who would be called Civil War Buffs (whatever that means)...yet I am not by any means an expert or an academic. But, with my ameteur acquantence with the topic I am appalled that in one line Mr. Ferguson puts Gettysburg in ""Franklin"" not Adams county, Pennsylvania and in another states that Mrs. Lincoln's Brother in law was killed in September at ""Chattanooga""-when in fact he was killed at the Battle of Chickamauga. I must confess that such looseness with the facts-easlily checked-tends to put distrust in any other factual information he presents. A newspaperman, which Mr. Ferguson was for many years, must get the Who, What and Where correct! Sloppyness might be a result of poor editing...the final responsibility goes to the author."
4,Capital!,The unifying thread weaving through this book is the inspiring story of the completion of the nation's capitol building's dome during the Civil War and the raising of the staute of freedom to cap the project near the end of the fighting and in time for Lincoln's immortal Second Inaugural address at its base.Mr. Furgurson does a fine job in the retelling of an important story. Those with a special interest in the history of Washington. D.C. will especially like this book.
2,"""New Age Hendrix""","I've been playing guitar forever, and have arranged a few acoustic blues renditions of Hendrix songs; it's no easy task. When I think of acoustic Hendrix, I think of ""Hear My Train A Comin'"" from his Blues album. This JH tribute is OK if you like soft, mellow, elevator type music.It's not truly an acoustic CD - There are many effects and processors that actually make it an electric effort. Sounded to me like ""New Age Hendrix"" played very soft & mellow on an electric/acoustic guitar heavily processed through a computer rather than an acoustic album. One guy I know who does a nice acoustic version Hendrix' ""Red House"" is Brother Yusef on his ""Blues by Request"" CD."
1,Shoddy.,"This is a Hendrix ""tribute"" album. Enough said. If you can show me a single ""tribute"" album that isn't more of an insult, then I'll show you an alternate reality. One, of Hendrix's greatest talents was his ability to use electric effects, such as feedback, to great effect in his songs, so I have no idea why you would want to make an accoustic version. Maybe because you are so untalented and uncreative, you have to cash in on man who isn't even alive to defend himself from such filth?"
1,Way overpriced,"The build quality of this cable is decent, but you can get the *exact same picture quality* from a similar 8' HDMI cable and spend less than $4. Of course if you have more money than sense, feel free to purchase this."
5,cool atmosphere music,"I like this recording. The atmosphere of the compositions is reminiscent of early spy movies. My favorite is ""She's Leaving Home"". The overall feel of this collection of songs is optimistic. It's great ambient music.As far as I know, this is the only sitar CD that he released under his name. It is very different from his other solo recordings.If you seek further info about the artist Big Jim Sullivan, there is a DVD about him that is currently available online. In it you find out what a central figure in the studio scene BJS has been, having played on hundreds of sessions that yielded pop hits. (Sound Techniques: Guitar Maestro Series 1)"
3,It's A Betty Boop Clock.,The face is easy to see. It's runs on couple AAA batteries with doesn't come with the clock. You can hear the alarm bells pretty good. The workmanship of the parts to the clock is cheap. To me the clock will not last for a long time. The person that I gave the clock too really likes Betty Boop so she was a happy camper getting the clock. So I'm happy too.
