2,Not worth the price!,"I just recently brought the Sony MDR-KE30LW and received them today. The product is horrible. It is filmsy like it is made out of some cheap plastic.The Karabiner is poorly designed, the clip part is a cheap piece of plastic that doesn't clip very well. You can go to a dollar store and buy an actual metal carabiner for $1 and it will perform better. Which is what I ultimately ended up doing.The pulling mechanism for the earbud is decent. However,the diameter of the product is too big. It is closed to 2 inches wide. It has this white outter rubber material which easily gets dirty. The cord is too short. It only pulls out from the earbud end. I wish it was retracble on both ends.My general dissapointment with the karabiner and casing should not be confused with the excellent sound quality sony gives us as usual. All in all I think this product was a big dissapointment. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
5,Speaking of Portuguese...,"The Pimsleur Brazilian Portuguese course is so easy, and all the words are spoken clearly. I am thoroughly enjoying each lesson, and I am confident speaking what I have already learned."
2,Not better than a course in person,"This series is okay. However, if your local college offers Brazilian portuguese (and you have the time), I think it would serve you better and may also be less expensive. When I was an undergrad, I took several courses in portuguese. It has been 7 years since I spoke the language (and even then I was not extremely fluent tho' could hold a conversation, understand, and picked up the accent). I have started to begin learning it again. But, the tapes don't give you the immersion that you can get from a classroom setting where, if you advance enough, you are forced to think in the language...not just repeat memorized phrases...and you usually have a lot of classmates who grew up using the language. The tapes don't teach you (nor do they profess to, I believe) how to say a completely new phrase using the words you've learned....that is, how to translate what you want to say in english to what you want to say in portugues.I don't think this series is worth [very much]."
3,"Good product, but very basic","I used this product and half of Portuguese 2 and i was not as impressed as I was hoping to be. In a nutshell, its very good for getting a feel for grammar rules, but not very practical for speaking. They teach you the very formal way to say everything (so formal sometimes, that you feel like the only one speaking that way). However, as I said, it is very useful for proper grammar as you learn more words from somewhere else."
2,NOT HAPPY BECAUSE DVD PLAYER DOESN'T WORK,I bought this TV for my son who lives in NYC (I live in MN). He received it and the dang DVD player DOESN'T WORK....and that DVD player is mostly what I bought it for since he is a movie buff and doesn't get great reception where he lives in Manhattan. It is EXTREMELY Frustrating because of the logistics...hopefully this company WILL replace the thing without a huge hassle -- at least I hope so.
1,InTheKnow,"Do not buy this thinking that you can cook directly on its surface (as in the product description it says you can) unless you like to eat paint. The grill is painted black and within minutes of placing a fire under it the paint starts to burn (and smell) before turning into a white powder. So maybe after extended use and having burned all of the paint off you can eventually use this as a grill, but for now I use it as a support for heating water or cooking in a pan. But since I bought it to use as a grill and to cook food directly on its surface (like the product description says you can) its not what I thought I was buying. Because of the false advertisement I give it 1 star. If I was buying a support to heat water and cook in pots and pans I would give it 4 stars (deducting 1 star for the smoke and smell you have to tolerate while the paint burns off)."
5,"Well built, heavy duty grill","This grill is sturdy and rugged. The legs unfold easily and provide strong support for the grill. This thing will easily hold even the heaviest items like a fully loaded large Dutch oven. I actually use this grill indoors in our fireplace in winter (although it just barely fits) and we love it. It also folds up for easy storage back in the box after it cools. Bottom line: in the world of flimsy junk labeled ""heavy duty,"" it's nice to find one item that actually IS heavy duty and works the way it should."
5,Perfect for camping,This camp grill was just what we were looking for. It was very easy to set up and use and our food didn't stick to it! We used it to cook our chicken and our steaks and they turned out perfectly! The grill allows just enough space to get at the coals to keep the low heat going! The price was just what we were looking for and it was at a lower cost then one of the major chain stores. I would recommend this product highly to all of my friends and family! Thanks again for a wonderful product!
4,Remember to use correctly!,"Good product to help make more use of your campfire. Just be sure that the fire is not too high under the grill or the extreme heat plus the weight of what you are cooking (a medium pot of full of water for example) will warp it. Common sense should have told me to be more careful but we caught it in time and there was very little warping. The finish seems to hold up to reasonable but not extreme heat (placement, placement, placement). I now keep heavier items I want to cook on it partially on the outer frame to distribute the weight and it works great."
4,Not a bad grill top,"I got mine at Gander Mountain. I also paid the $5 for 3-year warranty. Which is good, the rivets don't hold up so well. I think a small nut & bolt system would be much more sturdy. Will look into that this spring. Right now everything is in storage.we used it for a week when we camped on our land. VERY handy and very well constructed. We built a small hole underneath so light firewood."
1,Be careful,The first time i used this the black coating started to melt off the grill. I put foil over it to make sure non of the paint got in the food. I returned the grill no issue. The product is good in theory and solid. Would have been better if it were just steel.
3,Black Paint Burgers?,"""Ideal for cast iron cooking or for grilling directly on its surface."" - FALSE.It is NOT for grilling directly ON.This grill is PAINTED BLACK.On our very first use the black paint peeled off and stuck to the burger. Nice grill marks - not healthy though.We used foil after that.It will hold your cookware or foil. It folds nicely. It goes over a fire and doesn't explode.For that it earned 3 stars."
2,Don't cook food directly on it,"Pretty disappointed, bought it to grill steaks, but it's not a grill (despite the name). When we had it over the fire, the black paint on the grate started to peel off, leaving black paint flecks on my nice steaks. Definitely not something I wanted to be eating. Nowhere in the description does it say that you cannot cook food directly on top of the grate, and that was the entire reason I purchased it.Additionally, after 1 use, the grate started to sag in the middle from the heat of the fire. Wasn't terrible, but definitely made me wonder how this will hold up after several sessions."
5,Camping with the Grill,"I bought this because it was compact, didn't require propane and looks like it'll do the job. I took it camping where they already had a grill that flipped over the fire. We used the one that was already there for only one day, then realized this one was way better! I love this, I may no longer bring my propane stove anymore. This is so easy to pack with you, and allows you to still have all the warmth from the fire going everywhere.My only qualm is I wish it came with so kind of travel bag as it gets REALLY black. I'll make something to take it in to protect the car and our clothes though. Otherwise this was an excellent buy!"
3,Not Quite as Described,Do not cook on this grill because the black paint/finish will come off on your food. I put olive oil on it the grill before cooking and that didn't help. I'd definitely suggest paying a little more and getting the comparable item of another brand that is on Amazon (it has great reviews).
1,"It's cheap, and it breaks","In spite of the poor reviews, I went out and bought one of these. It worked WONDERFULLY for the first month. And then one day, it just died. Sure, I'm the idiot that threw out the box and the receipt. I may open it and try to fix it. But it broke with zero abuse.Worse, the degree of amplification seemed uncorrelated with antenna performance. As long as it was on, it was working well enough. Except for the times (before it broke) when the cable seemed ""loose"" and the signal was fuzzy.Don't buy it. Even at the low cost, it's not worth it. Other antennae work just as well (I'm using rabbit ears right now and I'm getting 95% of what I got with this) and don't break."
2,Received item without the A/C adapter,Received my Terk TV5 antenna without the A/C adapter. Returned the item and requested a replacement. The requested replacement never came but Amazon somehow refunded my payment after about 2 weeks.
5,this terk works finally,I tried a few antennas even the silver sensor and that one was the worst I thought even with a amp. hook up to it. with the terk tv5 I get all DT channels in my area. It's easy to move if needed to get better singnal.
1,Rabbit ears are better,I get better reception with my rabbit ears than I did with this power antenna. Avoid.
4,does a better job than rabbit ears,"i tried several differant indoor antenna designs, before finding this one. i found it to be the least space-hungry, and most reliable for reception. there is a TERKS-4 and a TERKS-5, the latter being an amplified antenna. both do a good job, i have one of each, and a MANT antenna, which doesn't hold a candle to the TERKS antennas."
3,I think it's me ...,"I bought the Terk low profile indoor antenna to replace a pair of old bunny ears for the big DTV switch, now delayed. The product seems to work fine, it didn't boost my signal like I had hoped though. It's about ths same as it was with my old antenna. I've yet to experiment with where I place it, say in the attic maybe, or something like that. It's not a knock on this product, I think it's just a issue of location with a item like this."
2,less than i hoped,"Terk Low-Profile Indoor Antenna (TV5)Less than i hoped in inproving reception. i even doubled it with another set of rabbit ears to no avail ,they probably interfered with each other . go with Terk hdtvo outdoor. easy and it works. you can use directv mast to mount. naw bobbah naw to paying for tv signal."
4,It works!,"I bought a new ""cable ready"" TV and found that with rabbit ears certain channels were unwatchable. With the Terk TV5 the unwatchable channels were improved to good quality and the channels that had good reception with rabbit ears were improved to almost cable quality. I was so pleased I bought a second Terk TV5 for my bedroom TV. The TV5 is advertised as an antenna meant to be used in the suburbs, however, I live in a brownstone in downtown Brooklyn and it works like a charm! The low-profile design is also a plus."
5,better then expected,for the price of this item and the picture it gives its worth twice the amount i paid. i have wasted money on other antennas and got nothing but this antenna brings it all in at a clear non ghost excellent picture. high def to comes in.its worth your dollar
2,Looks Good on Top of the TV,"Based on the glowing reviews I read about this product I guess I was expecting too much. After trying the antenna in several locations around the room, I went back to my old rabbit ears (markedly better reception than the Terk --- even for local HD stations) and then moved the Terk to a another set in the house. Even there it made very little difference from what I was getting with a $10 set of ears from Wal-Mart. Decided to keep the Terk, however, since I expect to eventually move and hope it will work better in a new local not surrounded by trees."
2,Not too good for me with standard def TV.....,"I live in the middle of St. Louis County in Missouri, so I should be getting strong TV signals from all of our local stations. Nonetheless, I tried this Terk antenna, and had disappointing results. For me, it did a better job picking up UHF stations than VHF, and the picture quality of the VHF stations got progressively worse as I tuned in the lower-numbered stations. (Channel 2 barely comes in at all with this antenna, no matter what I do.)I get the idea this would work better in the ""either it's on or it's off"" situation of picking up HDTV signals ... but for regular old TV, I'm not impressed. This one's getting returned."
2,The Terk HDTVi is better,"I was having trouble pulling in one of my local OTA stations with my Terk HDTVi so I decided to try an amplified antenna. The TV5 claims to have 40db of gain. I doubt it's that much. If it is, the basic design must be really bad because I was unable to get any signal strength improvement over the HDTVi. You can save a couple bucks and have a better looking antenna with the HDTVi (especially if you only need UHF reception)."
1,Poor reception,I can receive only marginally-acceptable picture for two channels here in Dallas. The other three are barely viewable. I am highly disappointed that I spent this much money and may be forced to return to cable TV.
3,Wasn't better than the un-amplified stub antenna that came with my TV Tuner,About my situation: I live about 12 miles west of most of the broadcast antennae for Digital TV in the DC area. Wanted an antenna that would get me access to most DTV stations without a lot of fuss. I have a coax cable run in my house that permits me to put the antenna on the top floor and connect it to my TV on the main floor.--I tried theTerk Low-Profile Indoor Antenna (TV5)which did not provide a significant improvement over the portable telescoping stub antenna that came with my WinTV Tuner. That being said the reception was very slightly improved.Ended up purchasing and keeping theTerk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Receptionwhich was better for my situation.Be aware: This antenna is 2+ feet wide when fully assembled. Takes up a lot of room.
3,Not What I'd Hoped For,"I wanted this antenna for a TV in my computer room that was not connected to Dish. Of the 10 local channels I can get with the antenna, there are only 5 that I can get in well (with a lot of adjusting). I live in the suburb and only about 20 miles from the TV stations, so I was hoping for better results. I have to admit though that this Terk TV Antenna is better than the rabbit ears I had before and, since I don't spend a lot of time in the computer room, it's fine for my needs."
2,Little to no difference over rabbit ears...,"I tried using this antenna with a standard, analog TV (this may be the key problem, I am not sure). I live in Lawrence, KS which is between Topeka and Kansas City, so I get channels from both cities.It performed worse than rabbit ears for lower channel ranges and about the same to minimally better for the higher channels (I can only assume it is a VHF vs UHF band difference, I am just not sure which band covers which channels). I even tried moving the antenna closer to a window with no change in the result.In addition, regardless of whether the power was on or off I had the same level of reception. The amplification slider made very little difference.Overall, I didn't feel it was an improvement over the rabbit ears and so I will be returning this antenna."
3,Not better than average,I already had an indoor antenna when I tried the Terk hoping for a better outcome than the one I had. It didn't even do quite as well as the unit I had acquired from Radio Shack. I am planning to return it. In some environments it may work just fine.
1,Not as advertised,This product is one of the worst I have ever purchased. It sounded so good with many features. What I found was that there was no difference in the received signal was the same no matter what mode the unit was placed in. The gain control video switch had no affect on the received signal. It does have noticeable directivity. it was very disappointing as the unit looks well constructed.
4,Good buy,"traded radioshack's Amplified VHF/UHF/FM Indoor Antenna for this unit. Got about x2 the channels and did not have to mess with the angle/location to get the channel. Still couldn't get some channels but it i think my bad location has lots to do with it. all in all i get 3 of the 4 main channels that I watch which is good enough for me. If you're looking for more, you might have to go cable or outdoor antenna if this unit doesn't pull in the channels you want."
5,Unadvertised HDTV antenna,"I bought a 32in HDTV for Christmas this year, but I didn't want to pay for the DISH Network HD Programming (too little for too much). I purchased a Phillips Magnavox, Phillips, Newpoint, Radio Shack, RCA, and other countless named brand HDTV antennas. The HDTV reception kept freezing. I read a review on the Terk TV5 antenna, which I already had installed on another television in my home. Guess what? The Terk TV5 picked up every local HD channel plus received other channels the other amplified antenna didn't even pick up. I told my wife I can't believe I wasted so much time and I had the perfect antenna at home the whole time. I recommend you buy this antenna now before they start advertising it as a HDTV antenna."
3,Terk Low-Profile Indoor Antenna (TV5),Setup was easy and the product is built nicely. I have the unit on top of an armoire. It isn't too visually imposing. I receive standard TV and HD from stations that are 10 miles away but have hazy reception (at best) for standard TV and no HD reception for stations that are about 20 miles from away. That was disappointing given other reviews so I'm going to try a directional indoor antenna.
2,This isn't it...,I live in an apartment in NJ facing away from the digital transmitters in NYC and this unit actually received fewer channels than the old unpowered rabbit ears I had previously attached. Needless to say its headed back in the hopes that another one might actually do the job and I can free myself from the tyranny of cable.
2,Not that great,"This product had great reviews but I was quite disappointed with it. I have it placed fairly high in my room and not much blocking it. Once adjusted, the picture is great and so is the signal strength, but once someone walks by, the signal gets all messed up. Sometimes, the signal strength just totally dies! Should have stuck with the rabbit-ear ones."
2,NOT an antenna for long distance reception,"I bought this antenna hoping that I could use it to receive signals about 20-25 miles away. I thought wrong. A non-amplified antenna that is directional will receive at least a few channels, this particular antenna receives nothing. I imagine that if you lived in a location close to the transmitting tower it would receive well, but then again... so would anything else."
3,Better than some,This antenna pulled in a local channel I couldn't get with other indoor antennas but then I lost reception of some others. It is very easy to put together and set up.
4,Squared Rotating Antenna,"My location is about 30 to 40 miles from the originating transmission towers for the stations I can receive. Most of the time the signal comes in fine, but occasionally adjustments are needed to tune in. It's easier to adjust than the rabbit earred antenna I replaced and more channels are available for viewing. I'm glad I made the switch."
3,"Works ""OK""","It's probably just the vagaries of signal transmission / propagation and not necessarily the product itself, but I have mixed experiences. Despite living near downtown in a major city (and in an area marked as being close to the TV transmission towers and having the ""highest signal strength"" according to the maps I reviewed, I don't get good reception without moving the antenna around and doing a lot of fiddling.I'm using the antenna to get HDTV channels on my 54"" 1080P Plasma and when they come through well they look very good. Unfortunately, I often have problems with the audio that requires me to much around with the antenna's location or rotation. I had expected a powered Omnidirectional antenna in the high signal strength zone I'm in to be more ""plug and play."""
5,Best antenna money can buy,I only have an indoor antenna and this one gets the best reception and pulls in far away stations. It fits in my bookcase that holds my TV.
3,I hope you have space...,"Bought the Terk TV-5 because it got good reviews.Pros:it worked better than my old Magnavox rabbit ears (pulled in more stations)Cons:*the ""low profile design"" will work well in a cabinet with lots of space, but the ears need to be rotated in order to get a decent signal and that requires 12+ in. clearance all the way around the device - I don't have that kind of space*it didn't bring in as many stations clearly as expected. WHen adjusted for clear signal on one, it would knock out a few others & thereby required constant fiddling (not the case with thePhilips (SDV2750/27) that I just bought as a replacement)."
3,The Dream was bigger than the reality,"I thought from the other reviews I read that this antenna would be more powerful. I guess I expected more than it could deliver. I think that you need to fuss with it far too much, and it works no better than my last antenna. I am disappointed but maybe the dream was larger than the reality."
4,Terk Low Profile Indoor Antenna,"I bought the antenna because of the reviews I read. I live in Omaha, NE in sight of four TV antennas which cause headaches for antenna folks. I have a plasma 42"" TV with the Terk on top of the screen. I get 24 stations with the Terk and 5 with the big antenna in the attic. Case closed the produce works grand."
2,not quite as good as I hoped,"It doesn't quite capture the HD signals as well as I had hoped, even though I am close enough to the transmitters. Apparently there is too much interference in my locale. I think an external directional antenna would be more successful. Also the horizontal position of the array requires a relatively large amount of level surface area to be able to setup as well as tune. The built-in amplifier did little to improve the signal."
2,Barely better than no antenna,"Maybe it's Sedona, AZ but this antenna drew in only 2 channels, and those gave very poor reception."
2,Not All The Features Work,"This antenna does pick up TV signals, but the additional features do not work.The cable / antenna video selector switch does not work. I was able to use this unit with an antenna signal only. I could not switch back and forth between cable and antenna.The on/off power amplification switch also does not work. It did not have any effect on signal strength.The coax cable attached to the antenna is hardwired and cannot be replaced (it is 70 inches long). The F connector on the cable just pushes on instead of securely screwing on."
3,Terk Indoor Antenna,"It needs a much bigger space because the antennas are horizontal and not adjustable. However, good reception if you can place near window!"
4,"The first one is great, but the second one I bought isn't as good","I got the first one for Christmas and it works great. I get five very clear channels -- so I can thumb my nose at the cable guy with glee. However, last week I got tired of carrying the antenna from one TV to the other, so I just bought a second one, exact same make and model number.The second one is okay, but having tested them both on the same TV I would say that the first one probably gets a bit better reception. The second antenna's power adapter hums and crackles annoyingly... hmmm....Stay away from Antonline -- there are other companies to buy the product from -- they don't stand behind any of their products. I am going to complain to Amazon about this company -- I wish Amazon would work with companies that I could feel more confident about.Bottom line: Buy the antenna because it is a good antenna that won't poke your eye out."
4,very satisfied,Given the other reviews I bought this item locally just in case I had to return it. It was very simple to put together (<5 minutes).The reception is a lot better than with my old RCA amplified rabbit ears. It is certanly not perfect in a few channels but I can now see all the channels I want to see. Additionally most channels reception is near perfect.
1,Doesn't do a thing,"I purchased this from the local electronics superstore hoping to improve my local reception. I'm located in the burbs and don't have line of sight with the transmitter towers. After a simple hookup, I couldn't tell that the antenna made any difference in reception. You may have better luck, but, I would suggest you purchase from a vendor that provides an easy return policy."
3,Terk TV-5,Good indoor antenna if you're within 30-40 miles of stations. Does better on UHF than VHF but I live so far out in the sticks that I was pleasantly surprised at the reception I received.
5,A Good DTV Antenna,"I ordered the Terk indoor antenna after having poor results with a Philips unit. My indoor location in a condo is not ideal for reception. There's a unit above me and beside me, and the outer walls are masonry. Even so, the Terk brings in an excellent signal from most of the DTV channels in the Denver area, and a usable signal from all. In my area, its built-in amplifier seems to make little difference in reception. When a channel doesn't come in well, small rotations of the antenna generally cure the problem. Recommended."
3,"Okay, but not exactly low profile","This antenna works okay, but not that much better than an unamplified pair of $9 rabbit ears I've used. It does pull in the digital stations without the amount of ""moving around"" required to get the rabbit ears pointed in the right spot.One thing that did surprise me (no I guess I didn't read the dimensions); this is not low-profile; the unit is actually very large. In the end I couldn't use it on the TV I had it planned for as it was just too big to fit on top or behind the flat screen."
2,terk low-profile tv5 not so hot,"This antenna did not bring in stations well, my old rabbit ears worked better, it was not a good use of my money."
1,A comedy of errors,"Actually the only ""funny"" thing about this book is how John Wiley & Sons allowed it to be published without a microbiologist proof-reading it first!The basic microbiology is riddled with mistakes and errors, the chapter contents often go off the topic being discussed, terms are misused (or wrong)and some of the facts and figures quoted contradict each other later on in the book - sometimes on the next page!I wasted 14.99 on this book - although it was fun spotting the mistakes. There are better books on microbiology for sale, buy one of those.By the way subtract 2 stars from the rating system - Amazon won't let me give negatives."
1,Incredible nonsense,"If this book can be published, then anyone can publish anything.The point at which I realized that I should hurl this book across the room was on page 11 where the author claimed that fungi were species of plants. I'm sorry, Nicholas Bakalar, either your medical friends whom you acknowledged did not read your manuscript at all, or they are just as incredibly ignorant as yourself and are not good candidates for saving you from yourself.I suppose this book could be hilarious for people who know better, but I worry about the 12 year old who picks it up and thinks he/she is being anything but misinformed by it."

2,Could've Been Better,"This romance book, The Heart Of The Matter from Lindsay Armstrong was just ok, it is not a favorite of mine! It is about a guy named Robert Randall and a lady named Clarissa Kingston, and the story is set in Australia. I liked some things in the book but what has kept me from really liking this book is that I didn't like the part where Rob got mad at Clarry over a misunderstanding and was really nasty and cruel to her."
1,Not recommended due to safety issues,I recently took my car seat to be installed at an inspection site and was told not to use any of these that go inside the car seat between the baby and the seat. They compromise safety. I will be returning the one I got as a shower gift and buying one that goes on the outside.
5,Bundle Me is Safe - and Comfy,"This product is in my top 5 things to have if you're having a winter baby and you live in the midwest. Perfect for outings, and taking naps in too! I believe it is safe in a car seat, as most parents are not putting on a coat in addition to the Bundle Me, so it is just one layer between the baby and the back of the car seat. Ask about it at your local car seat safety checks if you need more reassurance. A great gift."
5,JJ Cole Bundleme,JJ Cole Original Bundleme GraphiteExcellent product. A must have for all babies. Keeps the baby very warm and fits well into the carseat and stroller. No need to worry about bundling with blankets and putting on warm socks and shoes. I'm very happy with it.
4,Bundle Me Car Seat Cover,"I have been very pleased with the bundle me car seat cover so far. My son is just 3 weeks so I haven't used it for very long, but one of the things I like best is that you can zip off the front in case the weather is warm. I do worry as he gets a little older that he might pull the cover down over his face while I'm driving, as it doesn't seem like you would cover an infant with the entire fold.I have a 2 year old and I used the ""Nano Bag"" with him and liked that Nano Bag zipped up the front and you didn't worry about your child getting lost in the cover. Also, it's waterpoof in case you are carrying the seat in the rain (this one is not)."
1,"boring, old, redundant","It's all the same gibberish as is out there, adding nothing to the conversation. When will readers get irrefutable evidence? Probably never, because we humans are still a long, long way from understanding the ultimate answers. To imply otherwise is egocentric and false. Bad book."
1,Absolutely Moronic,"I'm going to be short about this. After 7 hours of listening I learned the evidence against Darwin's Theory OF Evolution is... it's wrong. The evidence for Intelligent Design is... things look designed. Even though the author claims ID and creationism aren't the same (really?), the only reference to who the ""designer"" was occurs when the bible is discussed. Other than that, who the designer was is never mentioned. Nor was who designed the designer. About halfway through the 5th disc you get to hear him compare ""Darwinists"" to Stalin. This was the most idiotic, moronic thing I've heard in longer than I can remember."
4,bombshelterbob on TPIGTDAID,"I must admit that I've stopped reading 4-star and above reviews and stick almost exclusively with the 1-stars now. It's generally not hard to spot the tin-foil hats in the crowd and separate them from the meaningful critical reviews. After going through the reviews for this book, I added it to my wish list based upon the assumption that if it can get under the skin of the wing-nuts this effectively, there must be something to the author's argument. I've determined that this method is particularly effective for religious, historical, and conservative political genres. This one has to be a keeper!"
1,The Unfittest Sometimes Survive Anyway,"Jonathan Wells understands current evolutionary theory about as well as George W Bush understands the Constitution... that is, not at all. I'm sorry I was suckered into buying this foolishness by the passion of these reviews; I won't be fooled again. For a solid and lucid statement of how evolutionary development is understood today, please do yourself the favor of reading Sean Carroll's ""Endless Forms Most Beautiful"" or any of his other recent explanations."
1,"Same old rehashed ""arguments""...","Oh, I'm sorry, I thought ""politically incorrect"" meant ""having a charming and irreverent disregard for the political norms of the day when discussing topics that are usually stifled by convention"". Apparently it just means ""rabid, frothing, conservative pap""."
1,A Quick Response.,"1. ID Is religion with a coat of ""science paint"". Make no mistake about that.2. The evidence is out there for the ignorant masses that ask for it, but you don't want to see it.3. The ""Gaps"" in the fossil record incontrovertibly PROVE evolution to be true because if g-d made everything at once we wouldn't have the fossil record. Get it? There wouldn't be a trail of fossils to find.4. There is also 100% no g-d. All you people need to be medicated.5. The level of human ignorance saddens me daily."
5,Let the Evidence Speak for Itself,"Wells successfully pins Darwinism for its lack of evidence and logic and encourages readers to use clear-minded, critical thinking to understand the key issues. As for intelligent design, Wells introduces what it is (the notion that the complexity of design in living things - like in human DNA - is extraordinarily unlikely to be the result of random change) and clarifies that ID is NOT biblical creationism.The primary benefit of this book is the way Jonathan Wells encourages critical thinking about science. Wells is a skeptic with integrity - he rightly rejects arguments which have no evidence and does not pretend to have all the answers. Wells emphasizes our need to continue researching, discovering and debating - all the marks of excellent scholarship.The book is fun, clever, and well designed with lots of factoid boxes to help readers get the essence of each argument. A more interesting read than Icons of Evolution, also by Wells."
5,This book put darwinism where it belongs - down the toliet,"I love this book, its easy to read and very informative. it dosent hold back any punches and sends those darwinists back in their hole. I would recommend this book to anyone who has any confusion concerning intelligent design vs. darwinism, and exposes the leftist agenda that darwinism pushing onto our culture. Very Very highly recommended!"
1,"From Regnery, so you know it's false","It amazes me that Regnery publishing still markets this defective product. Someone should sue them for it, and I'm not kidding. The idea that people will be misinformed about evolutionary biology (nobody but creationists calls it ""Darwinism"") through this, and that perhaps millions of taxpayer dollars will be spent by people defending ""intelligent"" ""design"" because of this tome is nothing short of an abomination, an attack on science, and ultimately an attack on freedom.The opinion of Dover - yes the judge used the cogent arguments of the plaintiffs, as he's allowed to do! - showed once and for all that ""intelligent"" ""design"" is nothing more than creationism dressed up like a prostitute down on her luck.Avoid this tome; read some real science. There's no such thing as ""politically correct"" or ""politically incorrect"" science.And when you have clowns from Regnery comissioning tripe like this, you know that the truth will be the last thing they care about."
1,A Designer is Not An Answer,"This book pretends to be some edgy challenge to ""political correctness"" when it's merely a standard unthinking retread of the usual fallacies and ideological nonsense the creationist crowd is so fond of. Invoking an intelligent designer as an answer to the complexity of life is no answer at all. It's explaining complexity we have evidence for (the universe) with complexity we have no evidence for (the designer) and stopping there instead of going on to provide an explanation for the designer itself when the existence of an intelligent designer would demand at least as much explanation as the universe it created. And isn't it funny that it presents intelligent design as a nonreligious, scientific viewpoint when its advocates all just HAPPEN to be religious?"
5,Darwinists surely get mad....,"...about this excellent work and they are doing what they always do: Attacking the author and his credentials, bringing in emotional arguments, twisting the facts etc. I would suggest: Actually read the book before you judge it and then do science and not ideology..."
3,Just to see what they are up to,"I am teaching a course on evolution, and every once in a while I check to see what the creationists have come up with, aside from the name change to intelligent design. It's the same sophistry reworked. There are some things that can't possibly be understood, and when they are understood, a new list is jinned up. Just for fun, check out Nov 2012 Scientific American, how to make a vertebrate eye from scratch. I suspect that our brains will never understand quantum mechanics, but biology continues to make sense."
5,Stunning,"I too had never heard Glen Campbell's (or anyone else's) version of ""Wichita Lineman"" before hearing this. Not being a huge Wade Hayes fan, I was stunned at his beautiful rendition. The only word I can use is WOW! A gorgeous song, a gorgeous voice, gorgeous melody, simply perfect. This is truly one of the best songs that nobody has ever heard. I don't know why it wasn't more widely played. But this one is too good to pass up."
5,Twelve Days Review,"The best holiday CD I've ever heard. Barta uses a REAL chamber orchestra with his trio here. Seems nobody uses real strings anymore. His arrangement of ""The Christmas Song"" with Herbie Mann is the best.Can't say enough about this one...Jeff Cantor"
4,Going back home.,"Joe South is a great songwriter, his tales of life and love touches everyone somehow, he really makes you want to go back to where it all started."
1,Bad Disk Recordings,"I wish there were zero or negative stars for this one. I got this disk for 4 of the songs. Walk a mile in my shoes has the music and background but not the main voice track. Birds of a feather plays fine for a while and then changes to another song. Even considering the price on this, it is a pretty poor offering. Capitol could not have bothered to check this before they sold it. Do not buy this piece of garbage."
4,"Nice overview of an eclectic, prolific pop composer","A handy 12-song summation of the hippie-era recording career of songwriter Joe South, a twangy, soul-drenched pop genius who wrote a remarkable string of smash radio hits, ranging from Lynn Anderson's ""Rose Garden,"" one of the defining moments in the 'Seventies countrypolitian scene, to the thunderous hard rock anthem, ""Hush,"" which put the band Deep Purple on the map. South's own versions of these songs are markedly different than the hits -- his ""Rose Garden"" is cluttered and compact, while his ""Hush"" is wildly funky and fun. Also included here are ""Games People Play,"" a top Pop hit for South himself in 1969, as well as ""Walk A Mile In My Shoes,"" which was one of his few actual country entries, and several lesser well-known gems from his back catalog. It's more rock than country, but still funky and down home, and worth checking out to see how these great songs found their genesis."
3,Joe South Is Not Country/Western.,"A few years ago I told someone on the internet about a certain song by Joe South (Walk A Mile In My Shoes). Well that person was excited that I liked country music too. But was stunned to learn that Joe South had nothing to do with C/W. Now I don't know what Joe's up to these days, but his music at the time were of life lessons. Civil Rights issues, and the new age of man-kind."
3,Someone telling you its ok,"There are some good, fun ideas in this book. Most of the information presented is basic. This is a good book for people who are looking for new ideas but don't know where to start. The book runs the gammat from helping people tell each other their fantasies, to everyday games. The book touches on some ""forbidden"" topics without going into too much detail.Overall, I think its a great place to start for people who want to experiment and/or don't know how to approach their partner with something new.I don't fit into that category, and found that most of the things that characters in the book wanted from their partners were elementary and basic. There isn't anything in the book that a little communication, imagination and research won't tell you. But if you are inhibited, there is reassurance that you are not alone and ideas on how to act on and communicate your feelings in non-threatening ways."
3,"Nice, but...","I really enjoyed the diagrams included with this book--it really answered questions we had about so many ""common"" and ""forbidden"" acts. The downside was that the book was a bit short for my tastes, we were able to try it all in just 3 days."
1,Good for beginners....,"All I could say is ""Been there, Done that"". It is more for couples who are starting to spice up there relationship. I found nothing new and disagreed (and so did my husband) with one of the chapters regarding a male taboo."
1,Not what I expected,"After reading the book, all I could say was ""Been there, done that"". It is more for beginners who are first trying to spice up there marriage. I found nothing new or helpful and even disagreed (and so did my husband) on one of the chapters suggestion."
3,not that great,"this book does a fair job of introducing someone to the world of epidemiology. The book is often difficult to understand. There will be a type of statistical method explained, yet no example on how to do it. There is no glossary. The chapter focused on the history of epidemiology is quite good."
5,Unusual application,Bought this mug buoy to put on my mother-in-law's walker. She loves it. It slips easily in place and is as easily removable when she doesn't want to take it with her. Now she can keep water close at hand since mobility is a problem for her.
5,This is very complex @_@,"Catherine has a lot to say, and at times I find her writing overwhelming. Though, perhaps if I give myself a few years to read and re-read this work, I will appreciate it almost as much as she does.I felt obliged to comment, though I apologize my review isn't that good. Once I've finished reading The Dialouge, I'll return and author a proper review."
2,Catherine's revelations for the church and individuals,"Catherine of Siena would recieve revelations from God and enter ecstatic trances. In those transes she would have ""dialogues"" with God which her sisters recorded, thus the title. Catherine was used by the Pope to be peacemaker between warring cities and as such she was a Papal apologist, meeting with nobles and dignitaries throughout Europe, a different role for a woman of that time. As mystic she would dialogue with God about the church, the pope, priests and recieve counsel that are recorded in the ""Dialogues"". The prose is instructional, not exhortive in nature. It is not a book that one reads expecting to come away uplifted and enthused, rather you will recieve sound direction."
4,Solid history of photography in the USA,"This book covers the history of photography in the USA in a year-by-year format from 1839 to 1900, presenting over 400 images, which include examples of photographic processes and works of individual photographers. Each chapter offers the reader an historical overview of one year in photographic history along with an excerpt from the journal of a photographer practicing in that year. These views in to the past provide an interesting look back into life of a practicing photographer of the past. I was particularly moved by an excerpt from a journal relating to the life of a traveling photographer who was asked to make an image of a drown child for the town blacksmith. The only thing about this book that I did not like was that it ended its coverage in the year 1900."
2,Fine with a major drawback,"I'm sure this receiver is just fine for watching movies etc., but if you do any sound design work and need to pay special attention to your audio, avoid getting this guy. This receiver has a fan inside of it and ANYTIME the receiver detects a signal it starts spinning and making VERY distracting noises. When I even listen to small sound snippets, the fan still spins. Why?? It's not like this would cause the unit to overheat... Don't even try disconnecting the fan because the unit will detect that it is no longer connected and it will reset itself. So... if you like the sound of your audio accompanied by a whirring fan, then this is the receiver for you."
4,Good guide to Florentine food,"Miller's book was our primary guide for culinary experiences on our recent trip to Florence. It didn't disappoint. While the section on restaurants is reliable, albeit somewhat tilted toward eateries in the Oltrarno, the real value of the book lies in pointing the reader to the better bakeries, markets and gelaterias around town. Too many other guides include the same old listings of places too often living on their past reputations. Look at the others when planning your trip, but take Miller with you."
4,The Food Lover's Guide to Florence,"A very helpful, organized tour of Florence for foodies. As many times as I've visited Florence, the abundance of great places to eat is overwhelming. This book lays out great places to eat in the various neighborhoods and their nearby tourist attractions. It also helps define where the locals like to eat. Very helpful."
3,Good thing it works..Bad thing it doesn't well.,"I bought this because it was cheap and because I'd like to have the finer tip. In short, it's good that it works but it just doesn't work as well. The lines aren't that saturated so dont expect to read this from afar. If you're ok with personal writing and being close to it at most times to read, then it's fine. Otherwise, don't use it if you're planning on using it as visual aid for others to read. Next time, I'll stick with the chisel tips from Expo."
1,"Dirty, Ineffective","These leave a nasty residue if the writing is left for more than a day or two and the quality of the writing is still pretty weak. I tried them on normal d/e boards, mirrors and windows and on each surface they were pretty transparent and hard to read.I generally like Bic products, but this is one I won't buy again"
3,Not For Teaching,"They are perfect for keeping lists on the fridge, but if you need them for teaching they dry out fast. I homeschool and these are not good for that."
3,It depends...,"If you want to use these yourself, I wouldn't recommend them. I tried using them for my calendar and was not impressed. The red is not bright enough - doesn't even look red. None of these colors are very bold. Now I let my children use them for their wipe-off books, and that works great for all of us."
2,A little faded,"The colors weren't really clear and looked almost transparent. They were shipped on time but I would not recommend, also it takes a while to erase from a whiteboard."
3,Hardly worth it; 1/3 of them suck.,"The 4 pack is great! The markers are clear and distinct and lasted a great while.The 30 pack, however, is a huge disappointment. Of the 6 different colors included, 2 of them (orange and purple) are beyond terrible. Out of the package, they work as poorly as the old markers I bought this pack to replace. Absolutely horrible.It's still a decent deal, I guess. Just don't think you're getting 30 markers for this price; it's more like 20. Still a better deal than buying multiple 4 packs, but very disappointing, especially if you were hoping to get more variety in colors."
3,"Poor saturation, but easy to write","I was surprised how light the writing from these markers was. The colors show up just fine on a whiteboard, but they are much less saturated than the standard black marker that was included with the board I bought. They aren't even really as fine as I would like, but I guess for larger boards (I'm using a whiteboard calendar) they would be just fine. I'll continue to use them until they run out, but after that I will surely be looking for another type of marker that writes more vibrantly."
4,They work great,"No much can be said about dry erase markers that work correctly. I haven't used them enough for them to run out of fluid, so that's a plus. ;)"
2,You get what you pay for...,Markers worked at first. Red is now completely dried out/not working.Green is not very good - Black and Blue ok.
1,Colors pictured are NOT what you will get,"Don't order these if you were looking for colors outside the ""regular"" basic ones. The photo shown is deceiving. Colors are from the basic color wheel - bright red, blue, green, Purple, orange, black. There are no browns - as shown. I am sure the markers are fine - but was very excited thinking there were colors ""outside the box"". Nope."
2,Not so fine,These should be advertised as chiseled point. Similar point to a Bic sharpie. Point limits the info that can written on the reusable wine tags.
5,Wowed me!,"The markers arrived earlier than expected, and were wrapped very carefully in a bubble envelope. Upon opening, it was my delight that they included Staples sticky tabs, something I was just about to buy. Then, upon use of the markers I discovered that the point is razor thin, and the line is too, these will not be ideal for presentations to a large room. The markers don't seem so juicy either, but that can be expected when buying markers anywhere other than a store. The colors are fine, the black is nice and deep, and the markers erase easily, even after periods of time left on the board. Great purchase, 2 for 1!"
3,Bic Dry Erase Markers,"I ordered these fine point pens for my wine bottle labels (the re-usable ones from the Wine Enthusiast). While the colors are good, the tips are not all that 'fine.' I would have preferred a finer point for my project, but I used these and they worked out okay. I would recommend these for a dry-erase board."
2,jerome,tg4 was a good girl group i remember this single when i was 10/virginity there single was released in the summer of 2002 and they was working on a video for cant trust a friend look like they are one hit wonders i know davida [the light skin girl with the curly black hair is acting]and keisha is part of a girl goup called dyme if i can find some latest infomation ill holla at cha
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME!,"Finally, a positive R&B song that talks about waiting to have sex when you're married, unlike all these other R&B songs that are out right now. Man I love these girls, I truly have to take my hat off to them for doing this song. When I first saw the video on BET and listened to the words, boy was I very impressed!"
1,OOO NOO !!,TG4 ... BASICALLYTHEY JUS WANNA BEZ LIKE USUAL DAT CANT SING AND DANCETHIS IS A DUMB SONG THE GIRL CANT SING SHE SOOO HIGH-PITCHED IT ANNOYINGLAWD I REALLY ADVISE U NOT TA WASTE YO TIME EVEN THINKIN OF BUYIN THE SINGLE OR THE ALBUM~~~HOLLA
5,Cool!,"Jake's life is boring. One day, he stares into a spoon and sees a reflection and it's not his. The reflection talks to him by taking all hisworries out. jake notices that the reflection is pure evil."
1,Too easy to relate to.,The first reviewer was right. This bok was far too easy to relate to. Because it could easily happen. And it did happen to me. I didn't like this book because it struck too close to home and it hurt me to read it. But that's just me. You might like it.
2,BORING,This book needs more action and more drama. I liked the way it was inside her head and you like were seeing what she sees.It was okay but I wouldn't have read it if I didn't have to!
4,Sweet story of the strengthening of a heart,"Confession: I picked this book up strictly because it (and its sister story ""Criss Cross"")is set in the community where I grew up. I wanted to see what I'd recognize.But while that would have held my interest for about 20 minutes worth of reading, normally, I was drawn straight into this tale because it is *timeless* and contains events that have happened to everyone. And it's a story that needs to be told again and again. Friendships change, you'll be okay. People move apart, but you'll be okay. New friends come along and continue to shape us, but *you* will always be *you* at the end of it... and it's all okay.I sure could have used friendly re-assurance like this when I was the age these girls are. This little novelette would have gone a long way in bringing some peace to those very turbulent early-teen years."
3,Do I havea friend in the World???,I thought that this book was a bit confusing because the author would switch the topic every once in a while. If you like a book that makes you have to follow the topic then this is the book for you! This book is about a girl named Debbie and her best friend Marreen. They would do everything together until Debbie and her family went on vacation. Marreen went and hung out with a girl that also lived in the neighborhood. Debbie began to fell more and more discluted. She felt as if she had no friends until she noticed a girl named Peggy that was in her class that lived near her with the same interest.....
4,Unfair,"The Friendship/The Gold CadillacI liked this book because it had two stories in it. One was ""The Friendship"" and the other was ""The Gold Cadillac."" This book had no no chapters in it. It was just one story and then the next.It's a book about how black people had to call whites special names, and do separate things from them. They called the black people colored in the book.What I liked most about this book was that the people used a kind of southern accent, and I thought that was cool."
1,Watch: Lots of typos and mistakes in Spanish!,"I bought this book because it is an interesting tool bothfor translators and interpreters.But oops! what my surprise was when I read the Spanish translation.There are lots of Grammatical mistakes, such as accents,change in the gender of the nouns and articles, etc.Lots of typos, widows, etc.I called the translator, PhD Glafyra Ennis who confirmedthat there are many mistakes.It is obvious that there were no Proofreaders and Second Setof Eyes before sending it to Print!!So, those who are not Spanish native speakers, be carefulwhen you want to use the Spanish.Good luck."
5,english and spanish medical words,i love this book its one of those things you must have when working in the medical field even if you dont i recieved it fast and it was very inexpensive.
1,worst history book I've ever tried,"This book seems like it was written by an 8th grader. Disorganized, it often presents an incongruous or dislocated sentence at the end of a paragraph leaves me wondering ""what?"" Inconsistent and often juvenile. He skips around and uses words that are not defined, unless maybe you are already a Latin American history buff. I am taking this for a college course and wish I wasn't taking the course just because of this text!"
4,Consistently Good,Good stuff from them. Keeps the Jawbox flame alive while forging their own identity.
5,shiva moon,Simply genious. This is the best fusion music I have ever listened to. Bolo Hari is incredible itself. It is amazing what Prem Joshua can do with the drums. We are waiting for him to come to the USA!
2,repetitive,"if you like endless loops of some mediocre stuff,then this is the album for you.boring.. where is the creativity ?"
5,queen of hearts,"Costume is wonderful does run a little small. I wear a 10 got a large, only problems I had is the puffed sleeves area was a little tight on the arms, But everything else fits great."
3,Sigh. Needs lots of work.,"It would be hard to fit everyone, and will require alteration. But here are some things to keep in mind. My daughter is a long, very thin 6-8 in everyday clothing. We bought medium. She is 5'5"" 108, with a long torso. The torso on this dress was even longer than she. It fits very tight even though her measurements are less than the stated for size medium. The back/torso is narrow, and the arms are tight, however, the bust fits too loosely, and too low. She is a small breasted, so if you are bigger up front, it will fit better. But you better be thin and long. With full hoop, the dress is still much too long by at least 3 inches. If you look at the picture, it will need to be hemmed nearly to the red band for my 5'5"" daughter with full hoops. Material is typical costume fabric. This is not one hundred dollar quality by a long shot. The dress arrived less than 24 hours after purchase."
4,A good costume,Great look. The quality is nice and the colors are quite alive and kicking. It was what I expected and the way it was packed allowed me to have it without many wrinkles.
2,Poor quality,"So excited to receive this. It does run a LITTLE small. The sewing craftsmanship is not good....looks like it will rip easily, and looks like they forgot to sew part of it (around the collar). The slip is HORRIBLE. Couldn't get the hoop insert to stay in a hoop form, and as soon as we put the hoop insert into the bottom of the slip, the slip ripped."
5,This tool is incredible.,"This tool is not cheap, but did the cam shaft seal job on my '93 Camry 5SFE (the 4 cyl) easily. Some folks are able to wedge a crow bar against the engine compartment to press the cam shaft seal in, but I couldn't make it work. This tool made simple work of it. Hopefully it also works on my Mazda3 in a few years..."
4,"A good album, but not quite the beautiful masterpiece that Perfect Timing is","The second and less collectible of Donna Allen's two albums, there's still some good stuff to be found here. Her big hit here was a good but not better-than-the-original cover of Maze's ""Joy And Pain."" However, ""Come For Me"" is a sensuous and beautifully robust ballad that might just be the best slow jam she's ever made. If you're a Donna Allen fan, or if you're intrigued by the things that reviewers say about her, you should certainly pick up both of her albums, but this one's not quite as good as her first."
4,"Excellent content, but ...","The content for the Batman Beyond box set was excellent, as expected. I was a big fan of the series and this was a must-have form. My only real complaint is that, when I received my set, the DVD case and its cover had been partially torn (the plastic cover-sheath, the paper cover and the plastic box as if someone had taken a box-cutter to them before packaging). The disks were undamaged, which is the important thing, but I'll be shopping about for a replacement case."
2,Quirky Bugs,"This is a buggy router.(1) If the WAN interface is set to static IP address, occasionally, the internet connectivity fails. The only solution is to change the static IP address and then change it back.(2) Several different network cards (Atheros chip set) seem to be unable to connect to this device.(3) Connecting is spotty at best."
1,A Big Fat Flop,"If I could indicate ""zero"" stars, I would. I bought this from Amazon. I have Windows XP. I installed and reinstalled it several times with the same result each time - it freezes up. Not just the game, it freezes up my computer! I have to shut it off to unfreeze it. Single clicking or double clicking (as mentioned in the previous review) was not an issue. I am completely unsatisfied, but as is usual with software, once the package is opened, they're not going to take it back! I think I'll stay away from Atari games from here on out."
1,Don't purchase if you have Windows XP,"Some reviews said that it would run with Windows XP, some said they had no problems...Well, believe the ones that said it wouldn't run....Just gave me a black screen. :-(Bought it because I could no longer run my Scrabble 2.0 on my new computer -- well, so much for that idea!"
3,This game is flawed,"I am an avid player and love playing on the computer even though this game is flawed. Every once in a while, when I'm winning against Maven and the game is almost over, about 1,700 points are deducted from my score and shows me I lost. This brings down my average a lot. This game is disappointing if you are used to the older version. It is tricky to move tiles around rack but I finally got used to it. It's cumbersome to look up a word in dictionary. In the older version you were able to check meaning of word just by played without having to type it in. Also I had to shut off the music, it was so bad."
1,Disgrunted Scrabble Player,"I bought this game and it has consistently crashed my WindowsME running computer. I have following their inane FAQ and the helpless desk commentary, but to no avail. And, since I've opened the package, I can't return it. With all of the bugs in the program as outlined on their website, you would have thought they would have issued a patch for this game. Even with every aspect of the system up-to-date, and even following all of their tips, my computer freezes to where I have to go for the cold restart. ...."
2,Good but I won't keep it,"A decent game that I might have used to enjoy those times when I had not much to do. But I won't keep this game as it breaks one of my cardinal in that is requires the CD to play the game. Maybe when computers first came out, this might have been acceptable but we are long past that time. If I install a game, I want it to play where and when I want to play it and not have to carry around a bunch of CDs. That is why computers now have hard drives.This game is going into the tank. I thought of selling it used, but then I won't do onto others as I don't want them t0 do to me.I played it a couple of times and might have given it a good rating but not with the requirement of having to have the CD each time I wish to play it."
2,Almost no improvement over the previous version,"I loved Scrabble 2, so I bought Scrabble 3 (also known as Scrabble Complete) as soon as it came out. I was extremely disappointed to find that this version is almost identical to Scrabble 2. If you already have that version, then don't waste your money buying Scrabble 3. If you enjoy Scrabble or other word games and you don't already have Scrabble 2, then I highly recommend this game."
1,Worthless--Do not buy if you have Win XP,"Can't get this program to work with Windows XP at all. Screen goes black and locks up the computer. Atari does not offer any kind of patch to fix their program, but suggests you open Windows Task Manager and start shutting down all the background program on your computer to eliminate conflicts. Sorry, but I'm not shutting down my anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall programs to play a stupid video game!"
2,"fun game, once you get it to work","I received this game as a gift so didn't have a chance to check out the reviews on this site before I bought unfortunately, I don't know if I would buy it again. I have Windows XP and the only way to get the game to work is to turn off my firewall before starting the program. Since I have a laptop I just turn off my internet access, then turn off the firewall, then the program works fine. It took quite a while for me to figure out how to get the game working so I just thought I would add my experience to potentially save others the time and aggravation I experienced. The game itself is great!"
1,Disappointing,"I've been a Scrabble player for many years. When I moved to a new home hundreds of miles away, one of the things I knew I'd miss was playing Scrabble with my friends. I bought this version which promises internet play. Trying to make it work across AOL and other service providers has been very difficult. Playing through Zone.com requires you to accept an unacceptable privacy policy. I've given up on internet play with it. The game can be annoying because unlike the original Hasbro version, you have fewer options in play such as when you are challenged and the tile shuffle has a weird grab and switch letter feature. There were problems getting it to load on XP."
1,Don't bother,"After buying Scrabble 1 with that ... annoying 256-color bug which also doesn't work on NT/2000/XP, I thought I'd give it another try with Scrabble Complete. I now have 2 copies of Boggle (which is a hard drive disk hog).... Anyhow, I didn't find this game fun at all and promptly uninstalled it.First off, I couldn't even get the game to play. I just got a black screen. I then found out (on my own) that if I disabled ZoneAlarm, then suddenly it would work. What the hey? Just to play the game, I have to disable my firewall? That's makes absolutely no sense.I haven't seen nor played Scrabble 2, but after purchasing 1 and 3, it's pointless for me to search for version 2. I didn't like the controls and quickly grew bored. I'll stick to yahoo's literati or some other equivalent."
2,"Scrabble, Where are You?","I would love the game if my screen didn't keep going black in the middle of a game. You must use your mouse to ""scratch"" off the black to resume. By this time, I have lost the momentum and after a few of these happenings, I have just given up and don't even finish the game. The music is better than all those laughing clowns in Scrabble 2."
3,"If you have Scrabble 2, then you alrady have this game","This is a great Scrabble game but I was disappointed to find that this game is virtually the same as Scrabble 2 which has been out for a good while now. The graphics are the same and the skill levels of the computer player Maven are the same too. The optional music that plays during the game has been changed but I find it a distraction and turn that option off. It may have a new mini-game or two (mini-games are little exercises like finding all the 2 letter words that can be made from 7 randomly selected tiles) but they're more for practice than for fun.As far as I can tell the best thing about this game over Scrabble 2 is that it includes a free copy of Boggle, if that interests you. It also says it works with Windows XP. I don't know if Scrabble 2 would or not.If you have Windows XP, really like Boggle, or don't already have Scrabble 2, then this is a great game. If you already have Scrabble 2 then you won't find much new here."
1,Does not work with XP,"I used to have this game with my old computer, and loved it. This version does not work with Windows XP.I wish I could return it, but of course I had to open it to find out that it's incompatable with my operating system.:("
1,Frozen!,"Despite what other reviewers have said, this game would not play on my XP based computer. As soon as the program tries to load, the screen turns blank and escape is not an option. This is the second time I've purchased a Scrabble game that would not play with XP, and sadly, I will not buy another copy."
4,Freezes up,"Great game but after playing a few times and then reloading on my new computer with XP windows version, it never worked again. Refused to load. Now I have to purchase it again and hopefully will receive a CD without glitches."
1,Does not WORK on XP(False Advertising),"I purchased this game and it does NOT work on Windows XP. This is the3 rd scrabble game I have purchased that advertised that it would work on windows xp, and not one of them works"
5,fun for all ages,"This game is fun for all ages and levels. My 10 year old son plays it, and his vocabulary is improved by the hints and suggestions. It is a big help having a dictionary right there to check words. For me, the professor mavern assessment helps me to improve on my game by suggesting mini games to strengthen my weak plays.Having read all the other reviews, i must be very lucky. I have had this program installed on 3 different computers at different times with xp as the operating system. i dont have to close anything down to get it to run, that includes all the security running in the background.The music, albeit elevator music, doesnt interfere with the thought process!I would thoroughly recommend this game. It would certainly make a great stocking stuffer."
3,"Scrabble ""Complete""","I enjoy playing Scrabble. I was disappointed to learn that Scrabble ""Complete"" wasn't as complete as Scrabble 2. Everything is virtually the same with the exception, I haven't been able to place ""Maven"" on the screen and enjoy ""it's"" animations with Scrabble ""Complete"". The addition of ""Boggle"" was a nice gesture. If you have Scrabble 2 you have a more ""complete"" version, stick with it.long time fan of crossword puzzles, from South CarolinaOctober 9, 2002"
1,Dumb program challenges existing correct words!,"I was excited to be playing computer Scrabble as an enjoyable work break/mental workout. What a shock to discover the game is a cheat! It challenges and throws out legitimate English words, negating your turn -- such words as YOYO, SOY, VETTED????? I often automatically lost my turn (and points) playing perfectly good words...infuriating. Don't know what dictionary they used to write the program but this glitch obviously ruins both the fairness and the fun. Don't waste your money."
3,scrabble player,"Enjoy playing against the computer. Drawback: The screen will suddenly black out for no reason and you have to scroll all over the screen to see the game again. This is very frustrating, esp in the middle of a game."
1,Bad Programming in Scrabble Complete,This game has a lot of potential for fun....but the programming seems to way favor Maven (computer challenger).
5,Scrabble Complete,"Hi..I have owned many different Scrabble software games, but this one is the best! The graphics and helps are outstanding. I would recomend this game to any Scrabble or Word game enthusiasts. Thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Scrabble Comp. Only Works With Administrator Accounts in XP,"I have read many reviews stating the program gives a black screen and you need to do a hard-boot. I have found this to happen if the user has a limited account in XP. I installed and played the game as administrator and it worked fine. My wife tried the game under her ""limited"" account profile, it froze up after trying to write a registry key. This indicated to me that it may have to do with her user rights. So, I changed her account to administrator and voila, it runs Scrabble no problem. I went back and forth a couple of times to see if any thing changed. Sure enough, everytime I tried to run the game on a limited account, it didn't work. There was another review about the game playing itself using the human's name. This happened right after installation of the program, but went away after I restarted the computer. It appears that you must restart after installing the software, but the instructions don't tell you to do so."
1,Slippery Marketing.....,"As several people have mentioned, I got the infamous black screen problem, and after searching the FAQ at the cosmi.com site, I found what the problem is: the program requires that you allow it to pass the internet firewall in order to operate correctly.Doesn't say that on the box, doesn't say it during the installation- but it's a requirement. The installation also puts (w/o any option to decline) one of those ""Free! One month of NetZero"" icons (wow, I hate those!), including an executable file that you have to search out, since deleting the program won't remove it.I find this sort of requirement objectionable (not to mention the advert) on something I paid for, especially when it's not on the box, and not in the installation documentation. It's especially irritating when it's on a game that kids play, and when the advert for NetZero is slipped in. I'm returning the game to where I bought it.Thumbs down."
1,"Save your money, Scrabble does not run on Windows XP","I'd give this game a -10 if Amazon had an option for it. I've played Scrabble on-line and at home for years and absolutely love the game. Atari has taken the game and ruined it for me. Don't bother buying Scrabble Complete if you are running Windows XP. It will lock up and IF you should get into the game it will run so slow you'll want to scream. I had an old copy of Scrab Complete. I thought it was a scratched CD so I bought a new copy. In the mean time, I bought a new computer and when I installed the new copy it didn't run on my new puter. I emailed Attari tech support and got the usual run around. Try this, try that, send a copy of a file, blah, blah. Here's an idea Atari, try installing a copy on an XP computer, then come up with a fix. I'm serious people, save your money and hope Hasbro buys back the rights to Scrabble."
1,They should be ashamed,"This product sucks. On my Windows XP machine I can only run this program with my firewall disabled, no other programs running, and the CD in the drive. And no wonder: I bought it from Amazon in 7/06 and it hasn't been updated since 2002. It's ancient & antiquated.Aside from the technical problems, it's just a shoddy game. The visuals are blurry, if the ""referee"" disallows a play where you've formed more than one word, it doesn't tell you which word is not allowed, it's slow, it's ""hint"" facility is ridiculous, and it uses multiple screens to accomplish simple set up tasks.Whoever owns the ""Scrabble"" name should be ashamed to have it on this game. It's particularly sad because a few years ago there was at least one excellent crossword game (Crosswise) that the company that owns Scrabble (Hasbro at the time, I think) ran out of business by threatening to sue them. Too bad they didn't buy out Crosswise and use it as the basis for electronic Scrabble.What a waste!"
1,Scrabble Complete isn't for Scrabble players,"The problem with Scrabble Complete is that, when you get to a certain point, it's more difficult to win, in a way that is unreal. You're faced with 7 vowels, while your opponent may get a series of 7 letter words-not real! My advice is to do what I did: send your Scrabble Complete to Atari and tell them to perfect a program based on a real game. I'm disgusted that I found I had bought the first Atari Scrabble, with a new name.DONT BUY IT!!"
2,Stick with the board game ...,"Right from the get-go, directly after the flawless installation, Scrabble got stuck in a loop where my human player (me) and ""Mavin"" (computer player), were both being controlled by the computer, though clearly not instructed to. As the computer played the game, I could not break the cycle to exit to the main screen. Soon my system locked up hard. I rebooted and attempted again, but once again was met with a computer attempting to control my moves. One more lock up and one more reset, and now I can play normally, controlling my own moves.Very odd indeed! The music is horrendous and must be turned off. The game is ""okay"" to play, but I end up becoming annoyed after awhile for no particular reason. Just some hidden form of angst the Scrabble Complete draws out. Boggle still sits, I haven't installed it yet.Stick with the board version of Scrabble. Have a friend over or two and be social. No sense wasting your time with the faceless Mavin."
1,Ridiculous!,"a) Requires the CD to be in your drive to play!b) Online registration attempts to dial a modem!c) Even though my son entered his age of 12 during the registration, which prevents their requesting any personal information by US federal law, he was required to enter such in order to install.Previous experience with this company (infogrames) demonstrated their ""Technical Support"" issues are handled after a period of DAYS!Highly NOT recommended, as are all infogrames products."
1,bummer!,"never got it to work even with help from systems expert at work, changed resolution and display, tried different compatability modes, etc.black screen and hard boot required to get back to desktoptotal waste"
1,There has got to be something better.,Don't waste your money on this. It seems the only reason this DVD was made was to feature someone's girlfriend's video. It's nothing more than...if you see an X on the screen your brightness is set too high and the girl in the middle should look good while the one one the right looks pasty. Now your done let's watch a terrible music video.
1,Monster hole in my wallet,"Color me stupidSave you money and your time.Thirty dollars for 20 minutes?? HAH!! Just like every other Monster product; overpriced and over-rated. Save you money buy areal calibration DVD.If I could give it back, I would.Don't be sucked in by the name...."
2,TV setup disk fall short,"I didn't get much out of this DVD. After going completely through the instructions on the video and making the recommended adjustments, I didn't notice any improvement. To give Monster the benefit of the doubt, maybe I had it pretty close when I started. I feel like I wasted my money."
3,"Good for a beginner, but not for a home theater buff.","I bought this hoping to get the best color out of my set up, but upon running the calibration wizard, I found that the settings I had chosen myself were actually the same as the wizard recommended...So I guess if you are really new to HDTV color and such, the wizard may get you close to where you want to be. I consider myself to be a novice/enthusiast, with what seems to be a good eye for color, according to Jenna Drey anyway:)"
3,Easy to use but could skip Jenna Drey.,This disk is easy to use but is not HD. I used this product and the DVE HD disk. This disk was easier to use and made the TV look better than the DVE disk. The cost was fair. Skip the sales pitch and the music video. It is great for people who want just the basic info and tests to set up a new TV.
3,good start,it's just a good start but too basic it doesn't give you all the levels you need to adjust the right way.
3,Alright,It was alright. The calibration off the internet was as good. Probably wasn't worth the money.
2,If you know nothing about TVs and like watching a dumb blonde...,"I, like others, saw this in a store (Fry's Electronics) and should have read the reviews before purchasing it.All the settings it helps you check could be done in less than 10 minutes if you didn't have to listen to Jenna's dumb-blonde rambling from a script that's designed to show you that she empathizes with how stupid you are about your TV. Only two settings needed minor adjustments, and I never made it to the Monster advertisement or video because I couldn't put myself through any more of the drivel.It does do what it says for checking the few things it covers, but it puts you through far too much annoying and useless talking to be worth the price."
3,It's ok,Do not know if It has made any difference but thought it was worth the gamble seemed like a good idea rater the spending hundreds having it done by a professional
1,TV calibration for Luddites,"If your VCR clock still flashes 12:00 all the time then this calibration disc is for you. Anyone interested in fine tuning their TV to get the best picture should look elsewhere. While this DVD will allow you to improve the picture somewhat, it is far from exact. The humor is bad, the on-screen talent belabors simple points and the calibration patterns are simple and inexact. They use actors shirts and suits.This DVD allows you to approximate brightness, contrast, saturation and sharpness. If you left the settings at their factory defaults when you bought your TV you will see some improvement but won't realize the full potential of your display.It takes about 15-20 minutes to go through the process to get the same results you could get from a broadcast picture."
1,I can't believe I bought this thing,"With the exception of two calibration tracks, this is an attempt to spice up the calibration process. The last track (a poorly lipsynced, undertalented, amateurishly produced female singer) is embarrassing. Lee should stick to making cables."
1,"Junk, I would prefer no star rating","Unless you could not understand the users manual that came with your tv, this dvd is a complete waste of time, almost an insult to your intelligence. If you want to look at smiling guys and giggling girls while you try to adjust simple tasks like brightness, color, and contrast (which are the only ""secrets"" they walk you through)this dvd is for you. Forget the music video and Jenna Drey whoever she is. I expected some insights and usefull test patterns. If there really are ISF standards, I would be ashamed to have my orginazation associated with this farce."
1,Monster/ISF HDTV Calibration Wizard DVD,"I wish I had read Marc Anderson's review first. I was rather skeptical about this product being so helpful and useful to really calibrate an HDTV, but unfortunately, decided to waste approx. $20 and buy one (not thtough Amazon). It might be of some use to someone who has never seen a TV set before, but the average person can adjust the color, brightness and contrast, etc. to get a picture suitable to watch by going through each setting, if you don't like the manufacturer's pre-settings.I had learned that such a product was available and tried several of the rental stores first, but they weren't available yet, if they even will be. Save your money on this one and see if there is such a thing that is really useful. Gary Patterson Decatur, IL"
1,This disk really shows what the monster company is all about,"This disk was the worst spent 30$ of my life. It really did nothing other then make me have to go back and reset my settings after the video was over.Just like everything else monster sales, it is way overpriced, and very poor quality.i can't believe they actually produced this video. It should be one of the dvds they hand out at the counter for free, when you purchase something at a store. It isn't worth 5$.The only way I can see this helping anyone, is if you haven't ever owned a tv before in your life. If you have absolutely no idea what so ever the settings on your tv do, then this might help you.If you have ever adjusted the picture settings by yourself before, do not buy this dvd.I would be very embarrassed to either sale, or create a product this poor. I am going to make a post on the polk forums to see if anyone wants it for free, and I will send it to them so they can laugh at me for buying it."
2,Not worth the money,THE DVD DID GIVE SOME POINTS ABOUT HOW TO ADJUST THE TV BUT I THINK IT SEEM LIKE THE REASON THEY PUT THIS DVD OUT WAS TO PROMOTE THE GIRL THAT WAS INSTRUCTING YOU THROUGHOUT THE DVD BECAUSE AFTER SHE FINISH THEN SHE WENT INTO AN MTV THING AND STARTED SINGING A SONG SHE RECORDED WITH THE VIDEO. I DIDN'T BUY IT TO SEE HER SING I WANTED IT SO I CAN GET THE BEST PERFORMANCE OUT OF MY HDTV THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
2,O....K.....!?,"A little dissapointing for my big 1080p TV i am getting a pro, BUT for mid to sm. tvs should work fine!"
3,Monster smonster,It's okay so long as you understand the whole video is made to sell those overpriced Monster cables. You can buy a half-dozen Mediabridge cables for the price of one Monster cable and no difference in performance.
4,"Effective, but mildly irritating","This is a very fundamental calibration exercise packaged with a lot of hyperbole and an embarrassingly lame music video. It is not intended for entertainment, however, and it does what it's supposed to do. The more electronically savvy user will want a more precise tool, but this one is good and inexpensive for the first-time user."
4,no rocket science,overpriced ?? certainly! helpful?? yes! i've used this on several hdtv in the neighborhood including my own. it's simple and concise. once you fast fwd thru the monster cable propaganda the images used to calibrate are real world and to the point. this disc confirmed my tv was adjusted pretty close but the skin tones needed improvement. any novice and some not so novice videophiles can benefit from this disc imho. calibration isn't rocket science and most people can do it without tools but if you want conformation that your four figure hdtv is giving you your best possible picture this product is for you. it gives you simple explanations and instructions that are easy to follow.
1,RIPPED OFF,"I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I READ A HOW-TO ARTICLE ON TV CALIBRATION.IT RECOMENDED THIS EXACT PRODUCT.IT DOESNT TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU DONT ALREADY KNOW IF YOUR SMART ENOUGH TO OWN A HDTV.ITS A ADVERTISMENT FOR A MUSIC VIDEO FROM SOME SKANK IVE NEVER HEARD OF.IM SO MAD I DONT WANT TO EVEN BOTHER TO DO THE WORK TO RETURN IT.BEWARE.ITS THE BIGEST JOKE IVE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME.IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.............IF YOU CAN TURN YOUR TV ON AND OFF,YOU DONT NEED THIS.I WAS ALL PUMPED UP,THINKING MY NEW TV WOULD LOOK EVEN BETTER...NOT"
1,Possibly the most annoying thing I've ever seen,"Well, buying this was a mistake.I'm looking for something that actually gives me some calibration standards - and to the best of my knowledge, there are no calibration standards that start with ""the girl on the left should look pasty and pale...""Don't waste your money on this one. I'm returning this ASAP.Not to mention I've lost 15 minutes of my life dealing with watching a crappy actress and trying to get to the content. Sigh."
1,Probably not worth it,"I bought this disk thinking I'd see major improvements in my flat panel (plasma) tv after using it. The content is certainly not pro. As advertised, it doesn't bore you with charts etc, using video footage instead. Ultimately I found I had my settings very close (to what the disk prescribes) anyway.I think you can save a ton and do a little research online and tweak your settings.I am a bit of a nerd, so if you feel totally green with tech and tvs, maybe it's worth the money to get a more laymen tool like this.It also seems suspect that the disk is in standard definition (NTSC) while it is clearly labeled as an HDTV calibration tool! The resolution and color space is different and it's hard to believe the calibration wouldn't be affected by this!!"
1,Don't waste your money. (Unless you're a novice),"This may be useful for the complete technophobe or those that prefer to be talked through something so I gave it one star.It has no color, grayscale, or convergence test patterns. You are better off using the THX optimizer on any Pixar or Lucasfilm DVD.It is presented as a series of scenes that loop every few seconds showing actors dressed in black and white with black and white backgrounds and some women that you are supposed to use to balance your skin tones, and other scenes with a pool table.Made for the novice who knows nothing about TVs.For a technophile serious about getting high quality performance from their HDTV you should look elsewhere.However, if you are a complete newb to TV or monitor calibration then this DVD is definitely for you."
2,Kind of ambivalent,"For quick and simple picture calibration, this is exactly what it claims to be. I hope an actual ISF professional would be a bit more involved than this. It marginally improved my DVD settings, except my problem wasn't with my DVD picture, it was more my satellite I was trying to fix. But now that I give it some thought, I guess all calibration DVDs are by definition only designed to work with DVD settings. Glad I didn't spend more than I did on it."
4,Simple tune up utility.,"If all you want to do is a simple tune up ,with out all the over complicated tech. mumbo jumbo and 3d glasses,this product will do just that.Very simple to understand. If you need a more advanced set of tools,this isnt it."
1,fuzzy films,"Films are very fuzzy and the sound tracks are not much better.What seemed to be a bargain based on reviews, in my opinion, is not. Save your money!!!"
4,Day Three of My Newfound Interest in Knapsack,"I picked up a copy of Day Three of My New Life after it was recommended to me by a friend. Of course, I had heard of Knapsack before, but had never checked into it until I finally got this CD. I kept on playing the first three tracks over and over and then listened to the rest of the CD. The vocals are suprisingly good and you can feel the emotion, along with some heavy guitar riffs and punchy drumming. Decorate the Spine is one of the my favorite songs, especially when the drums kick in during the second verse. Of course, you can easily listen to this CD all the way through since the songs are that good. I found Heart Carved Tree to be depressing, yet the lyrics and the vocals combined with the guitars make it still a pretty good song, grief and all. Overall this CD is awsome. Knapsack been getting a lot of playing time in my stereo, and I doubt it will see a changing of the guard any time soon. Highly recommended to any emocore listener."
5,Wowsers thank you Billy Arnold!,I'm the kind of person who knows if i like a band or a cd by the first few seconds and i knew the first time i heard this cd that i loved it and that i loved the band. this cd is great. everyone i have introduced it to has liked it too. its a great cd and you should buy whoever you are you consumer type person you looking at this review. i wish these guys would come to jerrys pizza.
2,"""It has been done before and more originally""","This CD is not bad but it is not great. Call it what you want; EMO, punk, alternate; it does not travel over any new ground. It has been done before and better by a host of bands. I don;t know what the story is on these EMO bands, but it is kind of like a [soda taste] test. So many of them are so similar that you can't tell the difference. The Sex Pistols did this years ago and a lot better! At least they were original! [....] If you truly want something new and different, look elsewhere."
1,their courage was confused,This garbage is one of the most hypocritical bands i have ever heard in my life. if you only knew... conservitive [...] and ironically enough they never did anything in music before or after knapsack. they surfaced once but their courage was confused. the secrets in the sacrifice.
5,Dog Trolley,"The item arrived on time, and was everyting it was advertised to be. It makes it very easy to put out our dogs without them getting away."
5,Improving Education,"This guide is offered to help advance professional development schools (PDSes) in assisting the simultaneous renewal of teacher education and schools. We believe that policymakers will find it helpful in learning about professional development schools and the policies needed to help them flourish. We encourage the convening of small discussion groups involving policymakers and K - 16 educators.While this publication offers some concrete suggestions regarding the financing and policies needed for PDSes, we believe that it's greatest use may be to stimulate such conversations. We encourage all readers to engage others in dialogue concerning its content. -- excepts from book's Foreword."
1,Wishful Homophobia,"Everything that I have learned about homosexuality says that this book is bunk -- not only bunk, but also transparent homophobia.First of all, I'm not gay, so I do not have that axe to grind.But I do pay attention to people, to the things I read, to the information I glean from all sources. I have had many gay friends, and still do. There is every reason, scientifically, anecdotally, and casually to accept the fact that some people are born homosexual and that any attempt on their part to deny it or change it is going to result in frustration, anger, and neurosis.This book begins by making the Biblical argument: it's wrong, so don't do it. Therefore, any reader will realize that what is to follow, whether it is the rhetoric, the ""evidence,"" the ""science,"" or the rationalization, is all going toward the desire to prove a ""conclusion"" that the authors have already reached.Silly books about serious subjects can do nothing but harm, and this is a silly book."
1,"Damaging, misleading and inhuman",This book and others like it prey upon vulnerable LGBT people and mislead them into believing that love is sinful and should be changed. Love is never a crime or a sin.
1,If i could it this book 0 stars I would.,"I am quite tired of the kind of old concepts that are spread around in this book. This is not done out of love but out of total blindness. Following what is written in this book will not lead to freedom but more misery and who needs that? Life is hard enough as it is without someone who is gay being forced to hate themselves, to hate who they are all because of a book that was written thousands of years ago and has been passed down to so many hands it's not even the same book. Open your eyes. It is nearly the year 2000. We don't need fear of this sort in the next century."
5,An excellent and lovingly written book!,"This book is well written. It is biblically based and gives an in depth explanation on the causes of homosexuality. For those of us who feel split apart by our Christianity and homosexual feelings, it gives practical advice on how to cope and overcome."
5,understanding,"This book is really great, and while it may seem to be austere at some points, it shows compassion for gays who want to free themselves from a deviant and dark ""lifestyle."" Promotes alternatives to homosexuality. 5 stars."
1,interesting idea,I'm waiting for the sequel that deals with heterosexuality. That would be a very good book.
1,You can't cure homosexuality,There is no such thing as coming out of homosexuality. This kind of book teaches people to deny who they are. It's not healthy.
1,As God Made You,"For obvious reasons two important chapters --religious abuse and sexuality abuse--are not discussed in this book. Why? Because the book uses religion and a a person's sexuality to act abusively. For a person struggling with their sexuality, (especially vulnerable young people), they are safe finding a resource that will validate their sexual orientation (whatever it may be) and affirm thier sense of worth and value as a human being. This book does none of that."
4,Sure to Be Hated,"Though it's sure to be hated since it doesn't speak political correctness, it's an important book to address the specific sexual sin of homosexuality. Just because society condones this sexual sin, the Church shouldn't do the same. It's good to see that there's help."
1,great way to continue self loathing and ignorance,This book is rediculous and what's more depressing is the fact that people find this book helpful. Its nothing but bigotry and propaganda. The idea is truly dated and continues to perpetuate the idea that homosexuals have a mental disorder. The positive reviews seem to be from people who struggle with their sexuality and from people who don't understand the difference between sexuality and gender.
1,What a terrible shame.,"You could read this. You could try praying. You could spend hours in church every day, crying, begging, wishing that you weren't gay. You could run away. You could marry someone of the opposite sex and go through the motions. One day you will realise that you have made yourself, and those who love you the most, very very sad. You will realise that the bible has been doctored and incorrectly interpreted. You will realise that there is a loving, wonderful, community of people wanting to support you, and that all this time you could have been happy. Until then, read this and torture yourself for no reason."
2,BORING!!!!!,I originally lost this CD to my Rottweiler five years ago. Now I know why. The only reason to have this CD is for the releases. But the rest is just dull filler. You might as well get their Greatest Hits CD instead. All their good stuff is on it.
4,Good music.,"After 7 is an excellant group.The hit's Ready Or Not,and Can't Stop are on this disc.Very good for any occasion."
2,A very average study guide,"The book does an excellent job of introducing Oracle Application Server and has a much easier learning curve than using the Oracle online documentation. I think it would be highly useful to take somebody to a basic level of understanding of Oracle Application Server.On the other side, the book is inadequate as a means to prepare for the OCA exam. It does not cover the topics in enough detail and the practice questions/exams will at best encourage the test taker to think they are ready to take the exam when they are not."
1,Wanna Live Like Us...Hmmmm,"The track 12 is titled ""Wanna Live Like Us"" with Krazy & P, sounds like they are better than anybody who isn't RICH like them. The chorus goes like this ""Wanna Live Like Us ,Wanna Touch What We Touch"" KRAZY, then P goes ""Young Nigg*s Wanna Live Like Us ,Young Nigg*s Wanna Touch What We Touch"" and the song goes on about their RICH lifestyle. Brag,Brag,Brag...I was taught not to brag about things i got maybe they weren't.Also Poor black & white kids keep making them rich..so if u buy into the hype your just selling your-self out..thats my opinion...peace"
4,Fantastic reference,"This is a wonderful book for any practitioner of Hapkido, but do not be fooled, learning techniques from a book is VERY difficult.This is not meant for someone with no knowledge of the art. I own both this book, and the first volume book as well, and they're a fantastic reference work to compliment my training.However it is a very detailed work to be sure. The only book I'd recommend more highly is Marc Tedeschi's ""Hapkido: Traditions, Philosphy, Technique"" book, which is less expensive than EITHER of these two books, and combines the knowledge of both, with even more emphasis on the effects of strikes to different vitals, and maps the entire human body several different ways.Speaking of price, the price on this site is CRAZY. You can get it directly from the World Han Mu Do Association for like $89. I would do that instead."
4,If you like Albee and Pinter,"If you like Albee and Pinter, you will love Morogiello. Three wacky characters in a hilarious situation point up our universal foibles, vulnerabilities and frustrations in a very quick one-act play. A taste of Samuel Beckett too. Highly recommend."
5,Sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,"This is a very funny, dark play reminiscent of Pinter and Orton. With only three characters (2 men, 1 woman), and a single, unit set, it is easy to produce."
3,Good devotional reading,"Francis and Clare both have some wonderful devotional writings, perfect for reading small portions at a time and then meditating on them. My only regret is that there isn't more of their own writings to read. This book, like many others, is filled with commentary and introductions to the writings which, although sometimes useful, often get in the way of simple devotional use. I tend not to like books where the commentaries and introductions take up more space than the writings themselves and that's nearly true of this book. Nevertheless, it's a good collection and worth having and reading."
5,Impressed,"Always had a soft spot for *Sketchers. Had been looking for a really well-made, high-duability shoes for my husband, in a darker color, without over-powering his style. This was a great choice. Comfortable, and really nice shoe. Very versatile, and accomodating for everyday wear. Looks good with almost anything, and dark shades don't overpower his wardrode or style. Thanks"
2,High Hat!,"One of Boy George's most interesting solo records to date. I first came across this cd at a second hand shop. And wasn't aware that George had made a solo record. I must admit that there are several songs on this record that are ""SHOCKING"".Anyway being a huge fan of Culture and George. I brought this record and only liked 3 songs, which are; Kipsy, Girl with combination skin, and my favourite on the record; Something strange called love.For those die hard George fans, this could be a goer but I recommend Sold as this had much more commerical appeal. However that shouldn't put any fan off from buying this record."
2,uuuugh,"As a fan of Boy George I hate to say that this album is full of horribly dated mid to late eighties pre-set synth sounds and rhythms, and bears no resemblance to his soulful, heartfelt beginings with Culture Club, or his later groovy dance hits as Jesus Loves You. Blame it on the heroin.... There are 2 good songs on this disc - the single ""Don't Take My Mind on a Trip"" and ""Kipsy."" What remains is dross."
3,Two Years Later Review......,"When I first got this set of cookware I was pretty happy with it, but after a couple of years of use the outside of the pans have lost their luster. Some are still the original dark color but some have faded to a grayish color. The bottom of the pans have lost their coating and is almost a silver color.I like the ease of cleaning them! Everything cleans up quickly and heat up much faster than my last set of cookware. If I had known then what I know now, I would do a little more research and find a set that will live up to its promises. I would not recommend them to a friend."
3,Better to buy cookware seen in person,"This is not a bad set, but, if I have seen it in a store I would have noticed problems I couldn't live with and would have passed it by. Pros: These are heavy pans that heat uniformly with a great tough non-stick interior. Cons: The pan handles are hollow and the metal tubes have a open seam on the bottom. They don't have a good solid balanced ""feel"" when picked up and I have caught my skin in the handle seam several times. The lid handles get hot so you need a pot holder to pick them up. The fry pans are shallower than others allowing food to spill over the sides. Food stubbornly sticks to the large rivets used to attach the pan to the handle. I gave them to my nephew who is just starting out and bought myself less expensive low-end stainless steel Calphalon pots and pans at Kohls. The Calphalon pans have a very nice thick rubber grip on both pan and lid handles."
3,Company does not stand behind the product,"We've had these for two years and really have loved them. We still do love them. But, we dropped the lid to the stock pot and it shattered. The company tells us they do not stock replacmenet lids for Anolon Professional, but we could use one of the other Anolon line lids. Unfortunatly the size of this lid does not agree with any of those that they do have. So, like the product, but am very disappointed with the company."
3,"Good set, but has faults","I purchased this set almost two years ago, and have been fairly satisfied with it in most respects. However, it is beginning to lose its non-stick coating, and some foods are sticking. This is especially a problem with the large stockpot. I agree with those who say that pots and pans are meant to be used and cooked with, and not pampered. I have followed all instructions as given by the manufacturer, but am still having a problem with the coatings. I have not tried to send the stockpot back, but it does seem that others have been unsuccessful. Maybe I will give it a try.Since I have nothing else to recommend, this set is probably worth the money. However, don't expect it to last a lifetime."
4,"Wow, what took me so long!","I can't believe I waited so long to purchase this set, ""Dec-2005"". I've heard much about it, but anyway analon cooks just like it says, professionally almost everytime. I have been cooking for many years, many pot sets later, I found a great set. They cook very evenly, from stock pot to saute pan. Heat distribution is excellent. They almost clean themselves, meaning wow, water practically does it by itself. The first time I cooked steaks I thought here we go again, but a paper towel just about got the pot clean, ""I used soap anyway"". I would and will continue to purchase Analon cookware. Well done Analon."
5,Wonderful!,This is a gorgeous set of cookware that performs at a high level. It's stylish and looks like it's from a professional kitchen. I love it.
3,Hot to Handle,"The overall value on this set is outstanding. Non-stick on the pots is holding up well after a full year's use but the frying pan is another story. The non-stick isn't peeling off yet but it is a lot less effective than it was when it arrived. This can easily be amended by enough oil, so we cope.My real gripe about this set is the handles on the lids. They get very hot. Enough so that they cannot be picked up by hand. I have other glass lids that use the smallest plastic insulators with great success, but with these you might as well just pick up the lid by it's edge. I have a feeling that this is the main reason for the extreme price reduction.If you're OK with always using a pot holder I say go for it."
1,Very bad product,"very bad product, just after a few months the nonstick part of it is gone. Don't buy this product for safety ( where do you think the nonstick material went? in your food of cause}, reliability ( just a few months)"
2,"Agree with a reviewer who says cool inside, bad exteriors","Pros: they look prettyCons: For the price, I guess I can expect a bit more. I have learnt the name is a hype and feel sorry to have invested in these (albeit) fancy tinpots. All my pots are so badly marked from the outside, it is incredible!! Cannot use 'em in the dishwasher or they will scratch! Cannot use any metal tools. Lids extremely heavy. I bought these about three years ago and these review were not there.I have an older set of Wearever which looks spectacular after all these years (6+). It is a beautiful dark maroon and the lids do not steam up. Unfortunately I am not sure if Wearever is available anymore.Would not recommend Anolon. If you must buy em' buy a single piece first before the whole setAlso read more reviews at http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006FXA0/qid=1086878801/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-5692354-8013632?v=glance&s;=kitchenbefore you commit!Happy cookin :)"
3,Cookware Handles,The pans work well but when I purchased them it wasn't clear that the handles aren't heat resistant. The covers and pot handles get very hot. You need a pot holder to lift a cover or shake a skillet while cooking. The first time I used them it was very clear very quickly.
4,Good Quality,I've used this set for about 2 years now and it still looks like new. I don't routinely put the pots and pans in the dishwasher--mainly because they don't get clean--not because I'm trying to preserve their new look. The only thing I don't like is that the lid handles get so hot you have to use pot holders to pick them up. But I knew that when I purchased them.
4,Nice set of cookware for the price,"I purchased this cookware for my youngest daughter. For her needs, these pots and pans are ideal. They are higher end than what she had and work for the type of cooking she does. She really likes the way they easily clean up, the variety of sizes and shapes, and their appearance. They would not, however, be appropriate for my own use as I am a much more adventurous cook than she is. I cook at a higher heat and would warp these in no time. That does not make them a bad set of pans in the slightest and I would recommend them to anyone with average cooking needs."
4,Top Of The Line,"I purchased this set as a gift to myself & I'm glad I did! These are very heavy duty pots & pans. They cook very evenly & sometimes you don't even need to add oil. The handles seem very long & just a bit cumbersome, but they don't get too hot to handle until you've had them on the stove for quite a while. The lids all fit snugly, but they DO get hot quickly. The price I paid was a great deal, I'm glad I didn't wait for someone else to buy me this 'gift'. I love 'em!"
5,OMG!!,"I love my pots!! These are the best pieces of cookware that money can buy. Nothing sticks to them and they're incredibly durable. I use one or more of them everyday--for the past few months, and I am glad I bought them every time I use them."
1,NOT dishwasher safe!! Read the care instructions inside the box!!,"We bought this product because Amazon said in their bullets ""Dishwasher safe, but handwashing recommended."" But in fact, the care instructions that come with the product are very specific NOT to put it in the dishwasher, that it completely VOIDS the warranty.This is frustrating because no matter how hard we try, we cannot teach my mother, who lives with us, NOT to put pots and pans in the dishwasher! We bought these thinking we'd be OK-- she would not ruin them-- and now it's hopeless to even think about getting them all back in the box to ship them back (the care instructions were at the bottom). I could scream."
4,what a shame,"what a shame that I can not get to toutch or buy this item, along with many others I wanted as they are only for shipping within the US. There are other people in the big old worlsd that have money and want to buy but do not live in America. Please oh please could you deliver overseas or at least display only those items that are available for shipping!"
5,Great cookware,"For everyday use, this non-stick cookware set is tough to beat. Each saucepan and stockpot is thick with a tempered-glass, stainless steel lined lid. Stainless steel handles are oven-safe so no need to transfer food to a different pan for baking. Washing is easy, with the exception of the weight of these pans. They are quite heavy. The glass lids fog more often than not, but it's nice when they don't. I'm very satisfied with them."
5,Best non-stick coating ever,"This cookware is fantastic. Most recently, I sought to simmer some plastic tubing that I had use for brewing beer so as to loosen the grime inside it. Long story short, I forgot about it over high gas heat, all the water boiled out and the sauce pan sat over high heat for over 30 minutes with no water! The tubing had melted to the surface and I was prepared to toss the pan in the trash as ruined. I poured some water in the pan to cool it down and was able to completely remove the melted plastic tubing (just lifted right out!) and wipe the pan clean with no scrubbing. The non-stick was in perfect condition and I used it the next night. This is a QUALITY set of cookware. Do yourself a favor and get this. Anolon has a lifetime customer in my book."
2,Too Hot To Handle,"The pot handles collect heat from adjacent burners and the ingredients. Perhaps because they are hollow, being rolled from thin sheet metal. The nice polished finish on the handles are slippery when there is anything on your hands or splatter from ingredients. We ""live"" in our kitchen and expect more from a cooking set. Sorry, but these are going back. Now what?"
4,"Beautiful Cookware, I have had it for a year and have had a good experience","The only problems I ran into were of my own making. I did burn already two of the pans and will have to replace them, as the non-stick is ruined. that said, all of the pans I've been using that I have not ruined are fantastic. They are adequately heavy, heat up well, and the lids are beautiful.If I had a wish list though, the handles do tend to get really hot, so you need to use a pot holder. I've been told this is how it is with good pans, but there are some that are a bit more expensive that have handles that are designed to stay within a certain temperature range."
4,Great cookware set,After reviewing and taking a great look of of cookware sets. I decided to buy the Anolon Professional. It's really nice cooking on them I warranty that they are not sticky and it cooks amazingly. The handles never get hot. The only problem I have noticed that the lids get hot easily. But which don't?
5,Anolon Pots,I love my new set of pots. They cook great and clean great. I do not put them in dishwisher. I just clean them with hot sudsy water. Easy as pie.
5,BEST IN THE WORLD,Never had pots and pans of this quality. I LOVE TO COOK NOW. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone. Even posted that I purchased this product on facebook. :)
3,hot to the touch,Analon cookware are fantastic! Most of the time you can't go wrong. I love this cookware but wish I had known the handles hold heat when cooking. Analon has other cookware that won't require you use heating pads for.
4,Monster Chalkdust!,"Check out this show, the Chalkdust Torture totally rocks. I don't know what it is, but Chalkdust is always special at Camden (e.g. check out 7-30-03). Also a cool little jam comming out of Fluffhead."
3,not actual bdu,"These are not real milspec BDU's. They are sturdy and serviceable, but they're not quite the real thing."
2,This manual is out of date; nutrition info is incorrect.,"The Green Iguana Manual by Philippe De Vosjoli is often recommended by pet owners and veterinarians. However, the nutritional information is out of date. Animal protein in any amount is no longer recommended in iguana diets, including diets for juveniles. Following this manual for nutrition information could mean your iguana ends up with kidney and/or liver failure and a shortened lifespan. Please see the 1996 edition of Reptile Medicine and Surgery for iguana diet information."
1,THIS BOOKS INFORMATION CAN HARM YOUR IGUANA!,"I do not recomend this book to any iguana owner. This book is by far the worst iguana book I have seen yet. The nutrition section is out of date. It says to feed your iguana meat!?!, and commercial iguana foods! Iguanas are strict herbivores and with this information, it can cause kidney failure! Im only 13 and i know better than to listen to this book, I honestly think you should turn to Green iguana, the ultimate owners manual, by James W. Hatfield for better results.With all do respectEric Tortorici"
5,Best iguana care guide currently available.,Includes very detailed information on the environmentaland dietary requirements of green iguanas in captivity.A must read for all iguana owners
1,Watch out for the screen!!!!,"The camera it self is very nice, i loved it while it lasted.... which is where the problem is. I had this camera for one month before the screen in the back cracked. There are many other people who have also had this problems and it is expensive to fix. For some reason the protection of the screen is very weak and needs to be upgraded for this camera to really be worth the risk."
2,Not predictable,I have this camera and am taking it back tomorrow. It can take good pictures but it also takes terrible pictures. I never know which it's going to be. Tonight I used the same settings for all the pics in the same lighting conditions and half the pictures where good and the other half were very grainy. I've been trying to figure out if I am not setting something correctly and have given up. I didn't buy a little camera to pull out of my pocket and spend forever adjusting settings so I can take a picture. I am very disappointed with this little camera.
3,panasonic camera,NOT SURE I received ALL pieces of my order due to a VERY Vague receipt...everything I did receive seems to work fine...
3,Performs well; $$$ to repair,I bought the camera for vacation pix in Alaska. Worked great; then developed a grey/black smudge in every shot. Not a dirty lens! The screen scratches easily (hubby's pocket with keys!) and is difficult to see in bright sunshine. End up pointing and shooting then reviewing in a darker spot. Hubby also managed to get some water into the screen which promptly turned black; camera was not working at all but after allowing to dry the screen returned but it still took a while for full recovery! Just bought a Lumix FS3 at Big Lots for only $88. Camera body has more plastic; made in China vs. Japan. Still alleges a Leica lens. We'll give it a try.
4,Small nice cammera with huge LCD,"Nice cammera, the image stabilizator works great, could have a little bit more zoom."
2,bah....,"this cd is actually enjoyable, but very stupid, ever since violent j started smoking, thats all he ever raps about and it gets annoying FAST"
1,Crap,"Wizard of the Hood???? Please, Violent J or ICP is not from the hood, ya they act hard.....IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD. This cd sucked, I don't know why these dudes hate on Eminem, cuz Eminem is about a million times better then this fool. I guess it's just cuz they are one big following, whatever ICP says the juggalos follow to."
4,Good Album,"This is a pretty good album, but not as good as i was expecting. Don't get me wrong, this album is really good, but i was just hopeing for more, i guess. Anyway, juggalos will enjoy this album, great story-telling tracks.MCL.Jono"
5,Violent J Is The Wizard,"The latest release from ICP's Violent J is excellent. The whole ""Wizard of Oz"" theme throughout the album is well thought-out and entertaining. It is a step up from The Wraith: Shangri-La. J plays the role of Dorothy while his homies lend their talents (Monoxide as Scarecrow, Madrox as Tinman, Blaze as the Cowardly Lion, ABK as the Wizard's palace guard, and Shaggy as the Wizard). Great album with a great concept. Lyrically it is fresh and the beats are bangin."
5,"J, Scarecrow, Tin Tizzy, The Lion, & The Wiz.","This album is the best Violent J has done in a long time. Every track on this album is exelent, not one bad song, and its hella mad funny. They really need to make a movie based off this cd. Mad props to J on this masterpiece. MCL!"
5,This is Awesome!!!!,"This was one of the best CD's I have ever heard, it was amazing. This album holds one of my favorite songs, Homies 2 Smoke with, this is for all you juggalos out there, if you get the chance, listen to this CD."
4,it was different,than most other icp cds. i bought a used one from here and it was in pretty good condition. it arrived extremely fast.
5,ABK,"Being a devoted Juggalo, of course I won't stop listening to this album. The main reason for my review is that in reading other reviews I noticed that nobody mentions the castle guard, ABK. So if you are an Anybody Killa fan, there's something on here for you of course. See you at the Gathering."
2,Very slow ...,The action did not really begin until around page 400. Her Farseer Trilogy was far superior and full of action. I kept reading this book because I wanted to learn what happened to the main characters - and because I paid for the Tawny trilogy. I am on book 2 of this series and it too is moving slowly.
4,A Great Book!,Even though I have not yet read this book the deliver and condition of the book were excellent. I was very happy to see that the coniditon of my book was in great conidition and the delivery was quite fast.
5,four-and-a-half stars,"Hobb really knows how to hit my sweet spot for escapist fantasy. I've been consistently impressed with her Six Duchies novels and I find myself seeking her books out more aggressively than other writers. I meant to take my time over this one, but I read it compulsively-- staying awake long past the point where I should have in order to finish it.I *roundly* dislike emotional manipulation in novels, but I'm happy to let my tears be jerked by these books. They play *shamelessly* on poor liddle animal sentiment and somehow it doesn't bother me. They're interesting, mysterious, sad, and compelling-- nearly perfect escapist fantasy.This new series begins with FitzChivalry being forced to take a renewed role in the affairs of the Six Duchies. Not only is there a new threat, there's also the need to face up to his responsibilities and begin to heal from his self-imposed isolation.Great stuff!"
3,Too Slow,"I had already read the Farseer Trilogy before I picked this book up. I was a big fan of Assasins Aprentice and of Assasins Quest, however, Royal Assasin was just too slow without enough plot development to be a good book. It is one thing to have a slow book that gives backround stories at ever turn. This is the way The Wind of the Forelands is written and it is excellent. Instead, Hobb writes about the scenery and feelings in such detail that it becomes very tiresome. If you like extended scenery detail, then this is a good book. However, if you are like me and like either action or backround stories, then this book will disapoint, much like Royal Assasin."
2,You have to be realistic...,"I am a bit disappointed so far.1. If I didn't read anything by Robin Hobb before, I would give up after the first 50-100 pages because I would assume I were reading chicklit.2. Too many descriptions. Too much of re-telling of old stories (probably intended to remind the reader what happened before, but way too much of it).3. The story line doesn't have as grand design as it was in The Farseer and The Liveship trilogies. What is happening in Fool's Errand feels like a minor incident in comparison. Just as if I were reading an addendum story based mostly on The Farseer and a bit on The Liveship trilogies.It is a page turner, but maybe I read it because I know and like Fitz?I sincerely hope it improves...otherwise it will be one of the greatest disappointments."
4,Excellent continuation.,"The Tawny man trilogy continues the story of Fitzchivalry farseer 15 years after the 'Farseer' trilogy. So if you havent read that series, than start there, and you wont be dissapointed.This trilogy is full of new characters wich in my opinion are proving to be even more interesting than the previous books. It is full of adventure, mystery, court intrigue and some lesser magics that the story revolves around. If you have read any of Hobbs previous work and enjoyed it than this will be no exception. I only wish I had read the LiveShip traders trilogy before this one. Its story has different characters, but falls chronologically between the 'Farseer' trilogy and this one.So if you read them in chronological order it goes like this-'Farseer' trilogy'Liveship trader' trilogy'Tawny Man' trilogyAny fan of fantasy should give these books a read."
3,Good but slow,"I am a fan of the Liveship and Assassin books, and I thought thie was really slow by comparison. I don't think Fitz is a particularly amazing character, and I find Hobb to be close to Bujold in her telling of the reluctant hero tales. I also think the writing is less polished than before. But it was not too bad."
2,"A bunch of stuff, with scattered good things","One damn thing after another happens to Fitz, fifteen years after the end of his previous adventures. Neat low-tech survival details followed by romance-novel gushiness seemingly designed to pre-empt the slash writers, some court intrigue, action scene, action scene, character self-torture, action scene. Dangers pile further and further on Fitz, but the whole thing is past-tense, so you know something amazingly convenient is going to get ratcheted in place just in time....On the plus side, you no longer want to throttle the main character for his endless tortured internal conflicts---there's a _new_ character who's _worse_. Also, what could have been a simple Good Guys/Bad Guys scenario is nicely complicated (here's a hint: what if ACT UP turned really nasty).If you have a lot of free time, this is less of a waste of it than your second hour of web surfing, but more than your first."
3,Dangerously close to a Furry Fantasy,"Some parts are very good. The premise and overall plot are quite believable. But there is way too much focus on animals - especially cats - as characters. If you don't think of cats and dogs as little furry people (blecch) you might want to skip this one. Also, there are allusions to Hedge Magic but it is largely undeveloped - probably for the best because this part comes uncomfortably close to the sort of embarrassing content you'd find on a sixteen-year-old's wiccan/pagan web site. And if hedge magic were as generally effective as this work suggests, its use would be much more pervasive in the society. Three stars because she develops the (former) Fool well as a character, and the former Fitz character hasn't become weak enough to taint the memory of the excellent Assassin series: note however that the former Fitz spends most of this tome as weak hand-wringing effeminate lackwit. This book could have used a few more passes through an editorial process."
1,Terribly disappointing,"Spoiler ALERT!!!!!I loved the Farseer Trilogy, and really liked this book until 3/4 of the way through. If youve read it you know what I'm talking about. The death of Nighteyes. Hobb took the best character in the whole series and killed him off. I'm so pissed off that I'm not even going to finish reading the rest of the Tawny Man series. A big F U to Robin Hobb for screwing up something that I thoroughly enjoyed."
5,"Excellent author, fun story line.",Fitz is back as a adventure-weary hero. The authors style is gripping yet fun. I've enjoyed the series and recommend the trilogy prior to these three as well.
3,Typical fantasy fare,"I think the main attraction to me was that I started at the end, and don't know how Fitz got his scars, or became friends with Fool among other things. Unlike most fantasy stories, characters were able to keep really valuable information from each other, and I spent part of the book holding my breath, waiting for someone to slip up. Otherwise, the characters carried an acceptable but hardly original story."
4,"First 200 pages can be skimmed, the rest is pretty good","The first 200 pages are filled with flashbacks/recollections of what happened in the Assassin's Quest series to get the reader up to speed, with little plot. I just read the Assassin's Quest series, so I skimmed through that fairly quickly. After that the story picked up pace and was a fairly good ride through to the end. There's something that happens on a beach, that I felt stuck out rather strongly and took me out of the story. Hobb is usually quite deft in her planting of seeds and it was rather sad to read this obvious plant that will undoubtedly pop up in the rest of the series. I'm not a fan of characters doing things that are obviously stupid to the average person. So, I was quite surprised about that. Other than that, it was a fairly fun book to read and continue Fitz's life."
4,Excellent!!,"I recently acquired this title, and sat down to read it. I found it just as captivating as the previous ""Assassin"" series of which this is a follow up. It took a time for the story to get off the floor, but once everyone was established you didn't want to put it down.Our fatilistic hero is in top form as ever. With grudging and guilt ridden inevitability resuming the duties to the Farseer family and world fate. He searches for peace for himself and strives to be left alone, while saving everyone elseNew twists have been added to the tale, and new factions have joined in to curl the coil so to speak.I await the continuation of this series with baited breath."
3,"Grand ideas, so-so plot","I am sorry to say that this book was something of a disappointment to me. I thoroughly enjoyed the Farseer Trilogy, consider the Liveship Traders trilogy to be some of my favorite books ever... and then there is this. Don't get me wrong; it was wonderful to see Fitz and Chade and the rest again, and I realize that this is the first installment of a trilogy, but I guess I expected more of a plot from Ms. Hobb. Once the story got going, it never ammounted to what it suggested. The concepts were promising, but in the end it was little more than a chase scene and some dialogue. Still, Hobb is a gorgeous writer and knows her characters, which is enough for me to keep reading."
3,Cuts Copland Short,"I bought this DVD thinking it was a blu ray disc. Nope. Regular DVD.This DVD has an excellent program but I was expecting it to cover all of Copland's career as a composer. The last decades that he adopted serialism was missing, works like Inscape, Connotations, are not discussed. I would have expected this to be in the program as he turned towards composition in this method sort of unexpectedly, just like Stravinsky. I would like to hear MTT's take on this turn and whether it was something we now consider a ""mistake"" on his part."
1,Misrepresented,"I agree with the excellent reviews about the discussion on Aaron Copeland. However, the performance is NOT full orchestra (where are the brass that add so much to the emotion of the music.) It wouldn't be so bad IF there had been any indication that this was an arrangement (ballet?) with a reduced orchestral content. No mention is made by Maestro Thomas or the written descriptions associated with the DVD. I have played this piece in several different orchestras but never this arrangement. Very disappointing."
5,AMAZON IDIOTS!,"AMAZON needs to re-think their idea of identifying classical music performers! Since when is a CONDUCTOR an ""ACTOR""? Since when is identification of a conductor or orchestra, etc. ""STARRING""?This musical blasphemy needs to be corrected ASAP."
3,Easy to use,"I currently use PSP8 at home and work and find it very strong so when I needed a photo program I turned to JASC. I had a project to do, pictures slideshow to music. While the image editing worked great, turning a group of pictures into a video slideshow didn't. Pictures were out of order which I had painstakenly put in a certain order and although I had created a video menu screen with music it failed to work in both my computer and home DVD player. If your instrested in video or DVD production I would look elsewhere."
2,for corss-country skis only,"This rack is very well designed and solidly built, but unfortunately it was designed some 20 years ago when all skis were straight and narrow, and has never been changed. The widest ski which would fit into this rack must be under 70 mm at the tip. My narrowest downhill skis are wider than that, and I am not even talking about all-terrain or powder skis. A wider pair of skis would rest on the bent tip of the hooks, which may over the time damage the skis. One could perhaps use this rack for cross-country skis, but forget about it if you need a solution for downhill.I bought it and had to return it cause it is useless."
4,good triller!!,"dis is a good movie whit many good actors involved. It's a intens movie and if you hvent seen it you have to, you vant be disipoyted."
2,Framed Honorable Convicted Marine...,"In a mission Sergeant James Dunn (Keenen Ivory Wayans) disobeys a direct order from a superior, which results in Sgt. Dunn killing the superior in self-defense. When Sgt. Dunn returns to the United States he is sentence to death and is about to be transferred days prior to his execution. During Sgt. Dunn's relocation a group called Black Sheep, with similar background as Sgt. Dunn, rescues him during the transportation, and they are sent on a mission to assassinate a man who is a traitor. However, this is just a front for the actual target, the first lady. Sgt. Dunn is framed for the assassination with his finger prints all over the sniper rifle and Sgt. Dunn's future seems to be very dark. Most Wanted is an action film with poor dialogues that forces the story along and with characters that seem contradictory to their real nature. In the end, Most Wanted provides a flat cinematic experience."
4,bald everywhere,"Most Wanted Feb 18 2013Good action movie thriller. Keenen Wayens is good. One of several movies where Jon Voight plays the villain well enough for viewers to want him vaporized! Few boring moments, but mostly good chase and counter-chase."
4,S&B Hot Mustard Powder,"Received this item promptly and was very pleased to get it. The mustard is good and hot. Directions say to use cold water to mix, but I used warm water from a tea kettle that had cooled and the results were very good with no lumping. It isn't mustard if it's not hot! The only thing I was concerned about was that there was no ingredient label and as I have diet limitations I wasn't really sure what it contained other than ground mustard seed."
3,This product met expectations,"My nearby Asian market closed recently and rather than drive a few extra miles, I was happy to see that I could order it from Amazon. This hot mustard is the real thing - just add water to the powder and it will cure what ails you! Very hot, but that's the way you want it; makes a restaurant quality condiment, not that wimpy stuff that comes in the cellophane packets!"
2,Not as good as the ratings!,I order two cans - One for us and one for my daughter. Would not buy it again. I followed up with an order for Chinese Mustark Packets.
4,Satisfied...,"This book has a ton of information. Mostly for the beginner, but veterans in the trade may also benefit. I've only used the book as a reference, but I plan on reading cover to cover."
5,great as refance,this is a great refance book for me too keep learning about network administrator job and it also has tought me some things i did not know and i saw this same book @ half price books and i have bought it @ Amazon thank you for proving this book
2,Not good for beginners,Not very good for my (beginning) purposes. Didn't provide enough information about any single topic for me to do anything.
5,Perfect for the unperfect computer user,I have thumbed through this book and it is exactly what I need.
3,Just ok,"First off, I love Nora Roberts. I have almost every book she has written in my library. This one is an early book and just not as good as many of her others. It is still enjoyable, but don't expect her usual standard of excellence."
4,Total love,Nora's books tend to take you to a exciting place you have never been. This book was no different. Nora showed that you can love someone but allow them the time to grow and find themselves and your love.
3,Beautiful but huge,"These are thin, lightweight but beautiful glasses. The only thing is that they far larger than I realized in the picture. I like a large red wine glass, but these are too much, holding nearly half a bottle of wine, while I found the sister in this collection, the ""So Long Red Wine Glasses,"" to be just perfect."
4,"Lovely, but Very Delicate","I adore stemless wine glasses. After breaking some others, I bought these for a great price on Amazon. They are beautiful, but the glass is quite fragile. I have had them for a few months without breaking them, but I am skeptical that they will make it to one year. They are, however, a fantastic price and no less sturdy than any other piece of glassware, so I would recommend them."
2,"huge, and they broke within 2 months","I was very impressed by their size... they were a bit unmanageable though.The first one broke, which was my fault (although a sturdier glass would have been fine), and then the second broke when I was cleaning it with a sponge...I clean lots of things with a sponge, and that has never happened. I don't have huge hands, and I didn't rough up the glass or anything -- it just broke... I don't know how I didn't cut my hand during that experience."
3,Tragic flaw,"Great idea, but be careful about transmission range.If the receiver is too far away from the transmitter, or is otherwise unable to get a signal, the displaydoesn't inform you of this problem. So, if the temperature is 150 degrees, and you walk out of range, the temperaturewon't update. Meanwhile, your BBQ is burning and you don't know.It would be great if the receiver beeped to indicate that it hasn't received a temperature updatein the last 30 seconds or so. Then, you would know need to get back into range.But, as long as you're sure that you are always in range, the device works well.Another gripe... Turning the device on requires a specific sequence:1. Turn on the receiver2. Turn on the transmitter, within 30 secondsOtherwise, the receiver won't pair with the transmitter and you won't get updates.And, if you turn the receiver or transmitter off then on, you won't get updates either.(So, don't do that...)"
2,"Ok, but some flaws","I guess the bottom line is that it does do the job, but...150 foot range? Not with a hurricane at its back. With brand new batteries, mine is a bit inconsistent at 25' line of site or 10' through an interior wall. Also, you can't disable that loud voice. When I'm cooking a 5 lb roast beef, I don't want her yelling ""YOUR FOOD IS ALMOST READY!!! YOUR FOOD IS ALMOST READY!!!"" when it's 10 degrees under the target temperature. I slow cook, and that means I still have a good half hour to go. I'd prefer a nice old fashioned beep.Also, it seems that if it doesn't get a signal for a while, it simply stops updating and the temperature changes to ""---"" without any audible warning. Now you've got to go back through the startup routine to find out what the current temperature is."
4,"Worked great for a year and a half, but eventually the probe stopped reading the right temperture",The headline says it all. I bought a bunch of these from [...] a few years ago. We used them once a week and they work well. Only problem is that the probe no longer reads the right temperature. It is also annoying that replacement probes are $[...]/each. It would be nice if Amazon sold a two pack of the replacement probes for $12 w/Amazon prime shipping. That would be fair.
2,Nice design but not accurate,"Bought this about 3 weeks ago. I tested it using the air temp and it seemed to work well. Then when it came time to use it, the receiver could not receive the signal. So, I placed it right near the base and reset it. Then it was fine. It told me that I had burnt the food. So, I pulled out my handy dandy temperature probe that has always been accurate and the food was raw.I have had wireless temperature probes for many years. As of right now, I have not found one that maintains the signal nor is accurate. I think I will go back to the wired probe and be done with it."
2,"""IN THE BEGINING""","""IN THE BEGINING"" (as God said)this item was great. i cooked my best turkeys and lamb loins(wasnt really paying attention that i couldnt take the reciever more than 5ft away) but now i am constantly frustrated with the distance that i cant use it and that i never know if im in its range, although there has only been one mishap"
2,Can't set your own temp,"Be aware that temp probes having a digital readout like ""BEEF"" or ""VEAL"" do not allow you to set your own temp, but only select from the four (or less) done-ness temp settings recommended for that type of meat. How about wanting to know when a cake reaches 220 degrees, or veggies to 130, etc.? Sorry. Can't do it. And heaven forbid you should want to set your meat for lower than FDA standards (and then let carry-over get it to safe range). This is just an FYI. If you're good with non-variable temp ranges like Rare, Well Done, etc., this works well. I'm still looking for a high-rated, reasonably sturdy wireless probe for under $50 that allows for infinite temp settings between 120 and 600 degrees. Know of any?"
3,Good Watchdog,"I got this from Woot for $18 back last May and I use this exclusively with a smoker. Although it reads 10 degrees low it gets me in the ballpark and lets me know when I need to start paying attention. The your ""food is almost ready"" chant in the wee hours of the morning during a contest gets a bit annoying and I wish it could be replaced with a tone. It serves a purpose but I would not trust it independently."
1,DOA,"I purchased this in January and finally got a chance to use it for Easter. It never registered a reading from the meat I was cooking. Now I'm stuck with an expensive timer. If you're thinking of purchasing this wireless thermometer, think twice!"
2,An idea of what you can expect,"All the reviews on this CD have been 5 stars, explaining their experiences with the music. I'm happy for these people for the benefits that it has given them. No one however, discussed what you can expect in the way of ""music"". Actually, as the title suggests, this is not music, but ""sounds for meditation"". Each selection is indeed as they state ""Pure Tone Scale Technology"". What that means, is that each selection is one of seven ""tones"". So for the chakra tones, you get 2 minutes of one uninterrupted single tone. The first selection is 12:23 minutes of these 7 tones, one after the other. If you think that this will be a benefit to you, please buy this CD. Personally, I expected something to help carry me through my meditation and this was a bit too monotonous (mono-tone) for me."
3,Great quality cd.,The cd is of great quality and it was delivered as promised. I am testing out different meditation music and found this one to be a good choice.
1,What a great disappointment¡¡¡,"This book really frustrated me. It doesn?t reflects what I truly expected. What am I going to do with this book? Throw it away, burn it or use it as toilet paper. This book is disastrous. Do it again, with exercises, spreadsheets, solved cases, CD, etc. I?m going to rate this book with 1 star. I want my money back."
3,Makes sense but....,"I guess Desmaisons theory is correct but her suggestions didn't really work for me. I do understand that sugar is detrimental to our health but how to go about eliminating it from your diet can be a struggle. I suggest Kat James 'The Truth About Beauty' or Roberts ""The Shangria-La Diet"" for help on loosing weight and cutting sugar."
4,"Good book, easy steps to follow",The steps provided in the book are clear and concise. It was also easy to read and motivated me to want to kick the sugar habit.
2,Use this plan to address sugar addiction NOT FOR WEIGHT LOSS,"I gained 15 pounds on this plan in 8 weeks. The first rule of the plan is to eat a high protein breakfast. For me this has to be at 6:00 am, since I have to be at work very early, and I am never hungry before 9:00 am. However, I dutifully ate the breakfast that I didn't want. The plan requires A LOT of protein. A ""fist-sized"" serving of protein 3 times a day adds up to a heck of a lot of calories. I just couldn't do it without being uncomfortably full. And I started piling on the pounds in no time. Ending every day with a potato, which I usually wasn't hungry for, hardly helped my waistline either.The nightly potato DID cure my insomnia, so there may be something to Ms. DesMaisons' research. But I am starting to question the trend of labeling every bad habit as an addiction. A lot of people have had success with this program. I gave it my best try, but I don't think it's for me."
5,A Good Book For Diabetics Too!,"As a diabetic I am always looking for books that will help me with my disease. This book is very straight forward and very gentle. While it doesn't have too much specific information for a diabetic, I like that. I can follow a plan that other people do and get spectacular results.I read her other book Potatoes Not Prozac and have been following that for two years now and have felt good and have very little sign of my diabetes.I recommend both books to everyone!SuzanneC"
5,Tina from Washington,Wonderful information on how food effects brain chemicals! This method improved my outlook on life so much. It is simple easy and it really works!
1,Not a sugar Addict's Recovery program,"This book simply changes one form of sugar to another form. They tell people to eat potatoes which are full of sugar. If you want to really get off sugar, try the following book.: Living Foods for Optimum Health by Brian R. Clement."
1,Great diet if you want to gain weight,"I am a lean guy (5'11"", 150) who has always had stable weight but I started putting on weight like crazy with this diet. Wow, I didnt think that could ever happen to me. Somehow, it also left me weak between meals. No thanks."
5,It works!,"I started using her program in conjunction with OA 3 years ago, and added regular exercise at a gym, and I'm down 100 lbs, and by following her suggestion of potato at night, I've been off of antidepressants since."
1,Zero Stars,"This is just [like one] of the Atkin's high protein diet with a twist - adding potatoes. She states in the book that this is not high protein but then she turns around and tells you to consume about 1/2gram of protein per pound of body weight! Neither of these diets concern themselves with the dieter getting proper nutrition. Without consideration for the body's nutritive needs, neither diet works in the long run. Ms DesMaisons claims to a PhD in her self described ""first degree ever awarded in addictive nutrition."" Both of these titles are from the almost non-existent never-heard of internet Union Institute. The catch phrase alone, ""addictive nutrition,"" is itself an oxymoron. Any serious health practioner (in fact anyone with common sense) will tell you that what's addictive is not nutritious. The terms are incompatible... You'd be wiser to spend your time studing nutrition and learning what your body needs and then following it..."
2,Lacking Scientific Method,The subject matter is well intended but misses the mark. What proof is there that any of this works? What studies can the author show? None.I don't argue that giving up sugar is a good thing. It is. I'm afraid that the implications are that SSRI's can be given up after sometime. Perhaps they can but without using the scientific method the author can fill the pages with only anecdotal information. This is treading on thin ice.How many will abandon there medication and depend on what food they eat? I hope those people will think twice.Robert
3,NOT FOR VEGANS! There are other forms of protein than animal,"This book has a lot of good tips, but it is environmentally irresponsible to recommend eating animals as well as nutritionally irresponsible, given the fact that meat, which is the muscle of an animal, is fat and cholesterol.The author mentions tofu, but doesn't mention the fact that vegetables have as much protein as animal flesh.Animals raised for food suffer more than consumers can imagine. Please stop promoting the meat industry and irresponsible nutrition."
5,A great tennis match,"Fantastic match, full of emotion. It was impossible stop watching it before its final. Sorry for my english."
4,Always Enjoy a great match.,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the DVD does not offer much more than just the match as it was broadcast. I would like to have seen an option for more angles of play or some separate bit on analysis of each players strategy, or... something. It was such a great match I had to buy it, but I don't like seeing the Lawn and Tennis club sitting on their laurels just because they're showing the Wimbledon final."
5,Excellent Bible Study,"As one who conducts two Bible Studies I found Steve Skelton's John Wayne Bible Study excellent for both groups. In the past I had used Three God Fathers, and this one, The Angel and the Bad Man is perfect. Also would be good for Church Sunday Schools or just plain in the home studies for families."
5,Ultimate Hulk,"The Ultimate Hulk figure is massive and very well detailed. The biggest problem I had is that his ankles and toes are articulated which means to get him to stand alone, you have to get those just right. Good figure though."
2,Weaker than Banner Grey Hulk!!,The artwork and sculpture of this Ultimate Smoke Grey/Black Hulk (the color of the one I purchased)is excellent but the aposableness SUCKS doo-doo chips! the hips are somewhat hinged as if the Grey Hulks favorite move is a friggin SPLIT! What the.....?? It can barely stand-up on its own....I was let down with this one for functional posing. I give a passing grade (C+) due to the artwork though!
2,Roger Federer vs. Pete Sampras: The Changing of the Guard,I felt short-changed. Because it is not the complete match.Roger Federer vs. Pete Sampras: The Changing of the Guard
2,Just clips,"I was expecting the entire tennis match, but the DVD only showed highlights and was ledd an hour. It was a gift for my husband... Perhaps in your ads, include the DVD runnng time. That would help us buyers know what we're getting. Thanks..."
2,Boring!!!,"Boring, and written in an unpleasantly uneven style. There are a few good observations about women's life in farming communities, but it's not worth reading the whole book just for those few good pages."
1,breaking clean by judy blunt,"I was appalled at this book, I grew up on a ranch close to the one she writes about. Her facts about ranch life are mostly untrue and I believe she was on a vindictive rout of the people on this ranch. I do understand that she has since retracted much of the book, but after she took all her 15 minutes of fame. What has happened to her. I was furious so see such a blantant piece of writing get so much play. There are such good books about ranch life she should never again create any piece of writing and expect the public to be so duped."
3,Breaking clean?,"I am always scouring the shelves for books like this--accounts of modern and not so modern ranch life in the American West--especially from a women's perspective. The boldness of the title attracted me. I thought, 'Now, here's something written by a women who's going to get straight to the point, and I can expect some raw and vivid imagery about the western landscape.' The more I read the less I liked it. I gave it 3 stars just because the prose is good--but the account just didn't live up to my expectations of the title and I was confused as to how Blunt really felt. Bitterness seemed to grow as a theme so I didn't get the idea that she really 'broke clean' she just made a temporary but emotionally she's still stuck on it. As the saying goes, you can't judge a book by its cover."
4,"A GREAT READ, BUT NO ENDING!","I loved this book, but at the end Ms. Blunt skipped from the early years of her marriage to the day she left with her three children. I felt cheated that she did not reveal the details that led to the breakdown of her marriage. I also thought she hinted at being gay, and also gave evidence of an early drinking problem but she never elaborated on either issue.All in all, I would recommend it, but I felt as though she only told half of her story."
4,"Great price for ""training zills""","I bought these inexpensive zills for my students to use in class, as I was running low on loaners. Of course, I wasn't expecting top quality instruments, but they are just great for students to use in class while they're learning -- and still leave the student some motivation to buy a personal set of high-quality zills! They came in individual zip-lock bags, and even included tiny safety pins.Perfect for teachers buying for a whole classroom!"
5,SHAGGZ THE CLOWN!,"ok, yeah this ep lacks in songs but who cares? its solid and they're all good, so, anyone not down w/ shaggs 2 dope can F*CK OFF!"
4,It's pretty good,"This is a pretty good cd. I just can't wait for Shaggy's new album called ""F#ck the F#ckoff"". It comes out on September 20, 2005."
1,I wish the artist would do as his album title states,"This sort of rubbish should never leave the confines of it's origin and pollute my children's ears with it's mysogeny,violent undertones and pointless lyrics.It's thanks to music like this that even my country now has become an unsafe place to live because of this intimidating ""Homeboy"" gang culture.It's funny when someone living in Sydney is heard saying ""Reprasent (SIC) Westside"" Not only is the music nothing but electronic garb,these guys cant even spell or talk properly.So please to all concerned ""F*C* OFF!!"""
1,Garbage.,"Actually, that's unfair to garbage. Garbage has some practical uses. This? It's idiotic ""words"" spoken by a prison-bound moron sold to line the pockets of unprincipled executives and low-lives. Comparing this to classical or rock artists is like comparing a fine wine to goat urine."
3,Not as effective as I would like,This filter worked off a bubble stone and doesn't create the suction that previous filter I have had have created. They used the filter for suction.
4,Interesting-contains good information,"Very informative book. It talks about many different resorts all over the world. It provides you with good information on which resorts have the best cabins, which ones are known for better fishing, golfing or lakes. I like that it covers which resorts are better for families with children and which are better for adults. This book does't only cover resorts, it also has information on different ways to spend your time, while on a trip. You'll learn all about different museums, activities for everyone in your family, sightseeing places, dining, and pricing on motels. This book has lots of useful information."
3,Question,"I looked at the stainless gas grills and I am curious why there are no words about whether or not you can hook up these LP Grills to Natural Gas (a permanent position). I know that you can get a conversion kit but this approach is not mentioned anywhere. We use to call grills for natural gas ""post grills"" for permanent installations. Would appreciate an e-mail stating whether or not you can convert these LPs to NG. Thanks.Ron Hoff rhoff@bellsouth.net"
5,"Excellent Pen, Sharp looking.","If anyone needs instructions for this pen or cannot figure out how to use it in 5 minutes, this person should not be allowed around a couputer, ID TEN T errors... This pen is not only multyfunctional it is just cool. You have a black pen, a pencil, PDA stylus and Red-Fluorecent pen. It is not heavy for all the stuff inside of it, or too bulky. The Matrix Grip does its job wonderfully. This is a pen to have in your desk and use for all your needs without having to get your stylus out of the PDA, plus it works a lot better than the PDS's in my oppinion. A great buy. If you still have not figure out how to work it, there are little pictures of what you want to use in the top side of the pen by the clicker, whatever picture is facing up, that is what you will get. It is very simple to use."
1,Defective,"I received this item as a Christmas gift. It broke just 3 weeks ago and I have been unable to repair it. A co-worker of mine, had the exact same problem with this item. Given the expense, I would not recommend this item to anyone. There are far more reliable products on the market for either the same or lower cost."
2,Poor locks,After only using the case several times one of the locks became stuck in the locked position. The only way to get it open was to break the lock. Low quality construction. I would not recommend this case.
1,Telescoping handle sticks,"I cannot get the Telescoping handle to go all the way down, therefore, making it impossible to retreive docutments,files and catalogs from the top since the handle prevents the top from opening fully to do so. Also, when pulling the handle up, the handle will not stay in the upright position in order to roll the case. I wish the manufacturer will repair or replace the case. I really need it and for it to work properly.Paul"
5,Great item for the money,Excellent value for the money. Seems to be well made. Will suit my needs well. Rolls well and no problems with it. Price is great for what you get. Couldn't find anything locally that fit my needs at such a good price.
4,Durable and inexpensive,"I use it to lug my case files and books around the courthouse. It's sturdier than the last case I had. I've dragged it up and down stairs at the courthouse and other locations without problem. It comes with a built-in area for your laptop and still leaves plenty of room for files. I love all of the pockets for my pens, cards, scissors, and lawyer kit. A great buy!"
1,Cooper rfm300w,"I bought this unit and put fresh batteries into it. It worked in the house multiple times, but after I put the stake in the yard it failed. I was bout 24F outside and the unit would not work. I brought the sensor back into the house but the light stayed on permanently.... Do not buy this ..the manual makes an allusion to letting the remote sensor ""Warm"" up. I guess it cannot work outside below ""room temperature."
1,Poor Quality-Not Recommended,"While Cooper lighting generally has a good name in the industry, this particular item is a total ripoff. Not only did the lock nuts BOTH break upon installation, but the motion sensor went haywire after two weeks. This product is poor in quality and is not recommended."
1,Poorly Made,"Seller did a great job and shipped the product timely, no issues there. The product however is of very poor workmanship. The light adjustment arm uses a plastic nut which promptly broke on install. I continue the install however and used a clip to secure the two pieces. However, the 1/2"" lockring then broke when I was tightening! I was using a screwdriver to tap tight and it broke in two. Of course I kept going and finally after tweeking and adjusting I got everything set how I wanted. Turned on the circuit breaker and it did not work....I went back to the manual and went through the troubleshooting guide and the unit did not work. It seems like the manufacturer spent all the money on the remote sensor and bought the cheapest lighting base. Having recently installed two motion sensors I can say this one is questionable at best. If you do buy be very gently with the plastic arm locks and handtighten the 1/2 lockrings. Even then it might not work though...."
5,A Superb Wartime Love Story,"Widow of Que-Moy is a touching wartime love story similar to Madame Butterfly and Miss Saigon. The protogonist, a beautiful Chinese maiden, was in love with a young American Officer at the onset of the Chinese Civil War in 1948. Fate would have them drifted apart and each had to endure the sadness and cruelty of life. They crossed each other in 1958 during the Que-Moy War of Cannons that dragged US into the China-Taiwan conflict. They finally reunioned twenty years later on the small island Que-Moy again. This is the island that Communist China bombarded with nearly half million shells in 1958. They were determined to rekindle their love affair not knowing that a larger political conspiracy was brewing around them. The tragic ending would bring tears to your eyes. If you are interested in the triangular relationship between the US government, China, and Taiwan, then this book will give you the answers. This is a must-read for the China fans."
2,Bad design,"I am on my third one. If you gig at all and use a POD, these power supplies will break eventually. The cord coming out of the box part has frayed and broke and the connector on the end shorted out. I am switching over to the rack mounted unit because these crappy things are the only way to power a POD."
4,Gave my POD 2.0 New Life!!!,"Perhaps these aren't made for longevity, as noted by another reviewer. But it works, and gave my (original) POD 2.0 new life. I tried cheaper adaptors from eBay that don't work. Go with the original. It's a bit heavier than the original one, but I believe the amperage was increased from 1200 to 2000 mA, enough power for the newer units."
5,Be Carefull AC vrs DC,"My mistake,. but an easy one to make,. this is a 9v ""AC"" power converter,. not a 9v DC power converter. if you need 9v DC,. do not get this one,. This really is just for powering one specific piece of guitar hardware that uses AC power.With that said, I hooked this up to a multimeter to see what it puts out and all stats are as advertised (5 stars for that as my reading mistake is not the products fault), though I have no idea where I'll ever have use for 9v AC,..."
2,Where did it go?,I ordered the power supply as a replacement for my old one that broke and i needed it pretty bad. Well i spent the extra money to get the part by the next day and it said ill get it the next day. One problem is i never got it. The last known place that it was is Phx and i dont live there i live 1 hour away! The tracking says its left Phx but i havent seen it for a few days now.
3,"good workout, poor sound",The workout is good. I actually became winded which is rare for me. But the sound quality is poor. The instructor speaks into a small microphone and it sounds bad. But I would buy it again if it broke.
5,Wonderful Read,"My fascination for Ismail Merchant started when I read an article on him couple of years ago. Since then, my interest in reading about the man and his journey has been immense. Finally I found the right book.It has the makings of a classic book - Its entertaining, informative, uncomplicated and is about the journey of a man whose dreams came true. I couldn't stop laughing when he mentions about the many incidents and decisions he made. I admire the common sense, persuasive skills and fearlessness of the man. I highly recommend it."
5,Greatest Hits on one release,"All my favorites are here, played flawlessly: Divided Sky, Tela!!! Glide, AC/DC BAG, Maze, Slave, Mike's, Weeks, And and a stupifyingly raging Bowie. Fast becoming my favorite of the series. A must have for the serious phan and a great introduction for the poor curious soul who is just now stumbling across the greatest band that jams in the land."
4,Great book but outdated,This is a very thorough guide on how to produce a book and I enjoyed reading it but it's from the 1980s and so is lacking information on what books have become.
1,Save your money,"The only track here that I think is truly listenable is ""Leader Of Men"". And even that one isn't their greatest song by a long shot. As I'm generally a fan of the music they put out, I wanted to like this CD. But I won't lie to you and pretend that I did. Most of it was unpleasant to listen to."
2,THIS CD ISN'T REALLY THAT GREAT,"Two songs: ""Breathe"" and ""Leader of Men"". Those are the best two songs on here, and both get old really quickly. All of the songs basically sound the same, and don't exactly leave you with a good impression. Don't get me wrong here- Nickelback is a great band, I just don't like this CD."
1,God help us.,This is yet another repeat album from Nicklecrap. Why this band keeps selling out arenas is amazing they release the same sappy album over and over and it sells. Wake up people!
1,Is everyone listening to the same CD?,"'Cause it's defintely not worth the 5 stars everyone's givin' it!If Tool and Alice in Chains got together and decided to turn to country music as their new music medium, they would sound like this band. It's the type of band you would see playing gigs in pubs/bars, maybe even on the street. The main singer just whines and whines nonstop (for no reason), it's so grating that it gets in the way of the otherwise mundance...'music'.There's really nothing special about this band, except the fact it says even the most suckiest music groups have a chance at the ""big time""."
3,Good Stuff!,"When first listening to this cd I heard alot of familiar sounds. On ""Cowboy Hat"" the acoustic guitar sounds alot like ""Days Of The New"". If you like ""Days Of The New"", ""Oleander"", ""Collision"", and even ""Creed"" you will like this debut effort. This CD has a little of everything for everyone. 2 of my favorites besides ""Leader Of Man"" are ""Cowboy Hat"", and ""Diggin' This"". Although this is not a ""Must have"" CD, it's worth checking out."
1,NOTHING NEW!,"the ""state"" belongs to the first days of the 90's, but what can i say we pased those days. not exciting, childish words and boring suond . i am so sorry that i bought this album from ... dont do the same mistake (unless you are a teenager! )"
1,not that good,"heres another band that tries so hard to sound like something thats already succesful. since everyone fell for CREED which is another band with no abundance of talent, Roadrunner thought that you might go for this too. its pretty safe. i bought this record not knowing what it would sound like but i was a fool...it's not that great...whiny, boring ""i've heard this somewhere before"" lyrics mixed with really familiar sounding guitars and songs...why buy???"
3,"Good tunes, but it is way to short","The cd is filled with many great songs. The only problem is that the the cd is only 38 minutes long, even with two different versions of ""Leader of Men"" ..."
5,This album rocks,"Everybody else that reviews this CD seems to be overanalyzing it. Plain and simple, this CD rocks, and one of the few that I can listen in my car on the way to work from front to back, over and over. It's really that good. If I had a complaint it would be that there's only 11 songs on the album."
4,A Best Kept Secret,"I, as I imagine many people, thought that Nickelback's first album was Silver Side Up. Finding out that they had 2 albums before it (this one, The State, and another titled Curb) was an amazing discovery. I didn't really know what to expect but I was pleasently surprised listening to this the first time. Though, if you listen to all of the bands work its easy to see how they have evolved over the years, this album is an interesting look at their earlier years and it includes a lot of great tracks."
5,This cd ROX!,"This is honestly one of the best CD's I have ever bought...the lyrics are great and very well thought out, and the beat in all these songs is amazing! All I can say is...what are you waiting for, go buy this NOW!"
5,"Forget ""Silver Side Up"", get this CD first!","This CD is the one to get, one of the best I've heard in a long time. These guys remind me a bit of Bush on this CD, however I think Nickelback has got them beat. ""Leader of Men"" is way powerful, as are the rest of the tunes, all of them rock hard. Great vocals, productions, etc.....buy it!"
5,Proudly Canadian,"This would have to be my favorite Nickelback album by far. I think it's ridiculous that this album, along with Curb, didn't get the recognition it deserves.But it is now, thanx to Silver Side Up.A previous review had said they sound like all other rock bands. In my opinion their lyrics, their style, Chads voice are all amazing and something I've never heard before in any other band.This albums lyrics are written mostly metaphorically. It isn't until Silver Side Up that Chad starts to write more openly.I dont know if this is strange or not but I had (it got stolen) this CD and the disc was purple. My friends say they've never seen purple ones before and that they're all yellow and black."
5,It's Nickelback,"This album is sweet! How could you not like this if you're into rock? Every song is solid. They have some sweet ol' solos on this cd. This is an awesome rock album, if you like that rock n' roll stuff."
3,Reminds me of 38-Special...but probably not as good,"It's nothing revolutionary, but then again, neither were 38-Special.It's just some good down-home rock by people who know how to play.Not bad!!!"
2,Slightly better,"This book is EXACTLY the same as the first two parts, but centers on one of the more interesting characters (like another reader already stated), Rebecca, and is therefore a little bit more readable. The structure of this serial reminded me of the early works of James Herbert (SPOILER AHEAD!): Someone gets introduced - and killed off. After that, someone gets introduced... - you get the point"
3,Great progression,"Part three delves more into Rebecca Morrison's life, we've met he in the previous books as ""poor Rebecca"" the woman whose parents died in a car accident when she was a teenager where she suffer severe head trauma leaving her in almost the same mental state as when she was a teenager. Rebecca then ends up being the ward of her religious fanatic aunt Martha, who drove away her own husband and child years prior. Unlike the other books where a ""cursed"" object is left at someone's home in this book Rebecca buys it as a welcome home present for her cousin Andrea who has finally come back to Blackstone after having nowhere else to go. I found this book focuses more on the main story line that ties the books together, which is not bad but left this part lacking in intensity though this is the first book to blatantly explain the connection between the memento and victim. All in all I really hope the books get better otherwise I have wasted my time for nothing."
3,A Lighter Touch,"Part three of this serial novel concerns the Ward family. Andrea, the black sheep of the family, returns to her home broke and pregnant. Her religious aunt decides to put the baby up for adoption after its birth. Andrea's cousin buys her a cigarette lighter in the shape of a dragon's head from a flea market. The lighter had been the instrument by which an inmate at the asylum systematically burned herself to death. Now Andrea tries the very same stunt and almost burns down the house. Andrea does die from the burns she sustained.Now her aunt has the lighter and she has decided to purify everything by setting the family on fire. Well, aunt and mansion are consumed in the flame but the niece manages to escape.Now we must wait another month to find out what happens next. The series is interesting in that a month goes by between parts, both in the story and in the real world. So stay tuned and find out what happens with a certain handkerchief next month."
4,Ford Medium-Duty Trucks 1917-1998,Very interesting book. The photos and text complment each other. Easy to read.
2,Too much horse jargon,"This book, in my opinion, was not very well thought out. There were too many misspelled words and grammatical errors. Did anyone proof this book? I did not finish this book."
3,Book,"A bit boring, still trying to finish itHope i will finish it soonToo long to get to the heart of the story"
3,A fun light read marred by excessive Political Correctness,"This was almost an engaging book for a fun light read to give a few laughs. But about halfway through it becomes tedious to find McEvoy is writing as though he has to get by a political correctness censor and can only choose villains or goofballs from the approved ""others"" categories. If the PC had been left out I'd probably read more of his work but he isn't good enough to entice me in spite of it."
5,An Excellent Book,"This is one of the excellent material that I have ever read on PKI. It assumes very little background and provides an impressive conceptual introduction to PKI. Language used is simple and very easy to understand. After reading this book, I am sure one will have a very clear idea of what/how/why of PKI. A must buy for anyone who has got anything to do with PKI."
2,planning for PKI,I was expecting something which is more practical with regards to PKI. Author talks about theory of PKI in half the book. And then provides case studies which has very low utility if you are thinking of implementing PKI in J2EE or .NET or even ordinary ecommerce applications...The title is totally a misnomer. Only good thing i found was that the theory presented was helpful to understand PKI...
2,doesn't cover baby's neck area,"I think it's a great product, quality-wise but I was disappointed that it doesn't cover around the baby's head and neck. Even if you use a hat, the neck area is exposed. If you try to cover the area, the baby's face gets covered which is problematic because it's dangerous and you can't see the baby's face. There are cheaper versions out there that cover everything except the baby's face. I returned this product for one of those."
3,Jeep Cherokee Owners Manual,The book was just what I needed to find out what the some buttons where for on my Jeep Cherokee.
5,Great K&N Replacement filter,I purchased a Nuespeed P-Flow intake for my GTI. The intake came with an oiled K&N filter. I decided I did not want to deal with oiled filters anymore so I purchased this AEM dry filter as a replacement. I've owned it for a month now and it's working great as expected and I don't have to worry about oiling it too much since there is no oil required in this filter! Great dry filter alternative that I believe performs much better and easier to maintain than your standard oiled filters.
5,It works!,"I'm not going to talk about the merits of using an aftermarket intake that uses these kinds of filter vs the oem intake. I simply bought this to replace a cone filter I had on the modified intake for a CX-7 that I had washed one too many times. The filter's 3"" inlet was a tight fit on my custom 3"" intake, it took some force to get it on, but not enough that it distorted/compressed the filter mesh. Butt dyno says I didn't lose power, maybe gained 1/100th bhp due to it being a fresh clean filter vs the old dirty one."
2,very weak vaccum,This vacuum is only good for picking up dust.The filter must be cleaned often.It should come w/ yr supply of filters and a link to where you can get more.Save your money and stick w/sweeping till you can afford a better brand.Eureka 442B SuperLite Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner
4,cute little vac,I really like my new vacuum. It is extremely light weight. I have not had any problems with it so far---although I have only used it three times.
4,Good for touch ups and light jobs,"So far so good - Since getting mine about a month ago, I've used it several times for quick pickups, and it gets the job done."
3,Basic Guide,"I would consider this a ""jump start"" book that contains much of the basics that one would need to understand regarding financial security and wealth building. However, I would suggest further study of other resources after reading this book."
4,Truly a Financial Literacy Enhancer!,"Whether your trying to save a little extra for your pockets, for a house, or your kids college funds, this book is helpful with getting you on the right track."
2,Celtic traditions,Songs bring memories but performances boring. Donating to Good Will. Good transaction though
2,Terrible Subtitle Quality,"If you enjoy English dubs, this collection probably gets about 4 stars.If you like subtitles or have a TV under 30"", this collection rates 1 to 2 stars.Problems I've Had:* Don't expect to be able to read menus and messages unless you have a TV larger than 30"" - they're just too small.* While the dubs are okay, though personally not to my liking, the subtitles are VERY had to read even on my new 40"" - thin, crisp, white text on the anime's bright backgrounds just does not stand out enough."
2,The very subject of mediocrity,"ok to start im a man and I love women but the amount of fan service that just wasnt needed kinda irritated me and yes the girls are hot but guess what...THERE F'ING CARTOONS, alright now that thats out of the way this anime is very meh, i didnt care about any of the characters or the story (if you can call it that) its just stupid but it is a fun show and if you prefer anime girls to real ones hey knock yourself out but for me it was just a waste of time that i could have used to watch a better series or just watch gundam wing again now thats how a mech should be."
2,To much TnA?!,"I bought this anime cuz it has what I like, robots/girls/monsters/action. But its really boring when there is no action! I really don't care about any of the cast. It looks great on blu ray, but ill never watch it again."
4,A fun series to watch,This was a good series i enjoyed every minute of it it was most definitely worth the price. I do recommend this series if your looking for an action packed comedic series.
1,hmm...,"Burst Angel has absolutely no point. The animation seemed terrible, especially for a Gonzo show. Frankly, I was very disappointed in this show, especially after all the build-up expecting another amazing Gonzo series. But, sadly, Gonzo really let me down. The basic plot (if you can even say it has one) is really just an excuse to show too much fan service, mech battles (totally uninteresting btw), and gun fights that make no sense. My fav character wasn't even a main character, which just goes to show how much they developed the lead characters. Anyway, this series was a big let-down, and I would only recommend getting it if you're into fan service (which I'm sure most of you are, lol)."
5,Far from angels.,"This anime was really good in alot of ways. With this boxset you also get the OVA which is really good since it explains more about the two female main characters and their past. I don't know what it is, but this series has a slight feel of Heavy Metal mixed with like Full Metal Panic!. I don't really know how to explain it without giving any spoilers away.It's actually not as violent as you might expect and the characters really depend on eachother. Jo the main herione while cold to some still has a tight nit bond with Meg. They have been together since the begining. Unfortunatly I don't want to go into too much detail, but I do recommend the series. I am sure one of the other reviewers might have explained it better, but I am trying to stay away from possible spoilers."
4,Burst Angel with Ova Boxset,Burst Angel Boxset w/OVAI absolute love this series. If you enjoy good anime with interesting characters give this a look. You won't be disappointed. Very fun Stuff here.
5,"Like Sloan, but better!","Yet another band to come out of the amazing Halifax rock scene. These guys put on a memorable live show, and their newest album does not dissapoint. ""Violent Dreams"" made me nearly wet myself, and the rest of the album is just as powerful. Buy this album, buy this album, buy this album."
1,Caveate Emptor - Dont order from this supplier,I ordered this product. It came weeks late with the wrong parts and it took hours for a plumber to use my old fawcet parts to correct the bad parts that were shipped.I called the supplier and told them my problem and they never called back.So dont order from them
4,A good continuation of the series.,"This is second book in the Capellan Solution series of BattleTech Novels. I found this book and the series to be a good return to the political strife of the Inner Sphere and away from the Clans. Also I found this to be a relavent book that continued the reader along the story arc of this series. This is opposed to the Twilight of the Clans series where there were one or two books we could have done without. While this story was focused and stayed on track, it did weave external elements of the Inner Sphere's politics into the story quite well.It was interesting to see how Sun-Tzu was protrayed. While most fans consider him to be one of the villians in the BattleTech universe, he is not so evil when you see the Inner Sphere from his point of view. Sun-Tzu's sanity has always been in debate with fans and this book will only add fuel to that fire."
3,Great Plot; Poor Ending,"This book as the sequel to Threads of Ambition did a great job of following up the story plot especially the sinister personality of Sun-Tzu's sister Kali. It also showed the constant watch that Sun-Tzu is on to keep from becoming like his mother, Romano. It did however conclude the St. Ives conflict poorly. When I read that Candace Liao was abandoning St. Ives, and then the book was left me wanting yet another book concluding this new plot twist. In conclusion, this book was written as if it were the second book in a trilogy instead of the last book of a two-part series."
4,The Capellans Won,"I think this book was good, but there were some holes in the book. First off, the Capellans wouldn't really have the skill or numbers to take ST.Ives. I mean all their units were small and green troops with few new mechs! Also The rep. from the Taurian Concordat wouldnt have agreed to ally with the CC. But the Plot was action packed and the story was good, but the CC has it coming now. Kai is going to do something. The involvemant of Aris Sung was the real cool thing about the 2 books."
4,"Great for big jobs, but you can get alternatives","The quality of the tape that's packaged with the tape'n drape is pretty decent, but at times I wish I'm working with a wider tape. Take a look at tape dispenser that can load a plastic or paper drape at the same time. Those dispensers cost about $25 bucks but now you have the option of different tape and drape size combinations. If you have a small job, then this is perfect, but otherwise, I would suggest investing in the right tool for more flexibility."
1,An Awful Read: Don't Waste Your Time,"This book is simply painful. The author is downright offensive with his failed use of big words. For gods sake, he's writing about the Boss here! He should really think about his audience before writing. What a waste of time....ugh."
1,Seemed like a good idea at the time.....,"Sorry to have to give this a bad review. This sounded like such a great book, and I really liked the title. But yikes, how to figure out what the author is actually trying to say? I find myself reading the paragraphs over and over again and still not knowing quite what happened. Oh well, I'm glad some readers were able to figure it all out, I'll keep trying. At least the author picked a great topic!"
1,DON'T BOTHER,"Reads like petty gossip. A true Bruce fan will enjoy Eric Alterman's ""Ain't No Sin TO Be Glad You're Alive"""
1,And the 1 Star is for the pictures,"It's a shame books can't come with ""Hazardous to Your Health"" warning labels for Springsteen fans.As nearly as I can figure, the author used as many anonymous sources as possible, and filled in the blanks with whatever information he could make up. He also obviously kept his Thesaurus close by so he could adhere to the adage: ""If you can't dazzle them with facts, baffle them with BS.""True Springsteen needn't waste their money unless they have been advised by their doctor to raise their blood pressure a couple points."
4,More than a child of war,"Visually stunning as it is moving, War Dance captures the perspective and plight of a group of children in the midst of war. Tracing the journey of a tribe stripped of its ancestral land, the children in the refugee camp prepare for a national music competition. Details of their personal lives are revealed, along with their passion for music. Any music lover will appreciate this film, and all who strive to overcome hardship will identify with its message."
5,"Pure, Moving and Inspiring","After living in North East Congo durring the most recent war as well as regular travel through Northern Uganda through th past 10 years this movie / documentary has touched me deeply. It is honest, open and revealing. The Ugandan people are some of the warmest, open and real people I have ever met and the tragedies they have endured, some of which I have experienced with my own eyes has formed a bond with these people and others like them. I recommend this movie to all those who wish to wake up to the world around them. You will experience the pain, the resolution, the determination as well as the joy of those who had no choice but to look death in the face and move forward."
4,African History in Making,"It is a doco on horrors of Uganda internal affairs similar to too many other places of Africa.No entertainment but pure historical testimony to continuingly fallen activities of the UN and ""civilised world""."
5,outstanding film,"This is an outstanding film. It handles a difficult situation in an uplifting, moving way. I work with children whose families are involved in Family Court for neglect and/or abuse. Children are amazingly rescilient and hopeful. War/Dance demonstrates that in a beautiful way."
5,Excellent teaching tool,"I used this video during a unit on African drumming with my 8th grade music class. The students not only became engrossed in the lives of the children in the video (who were their own age) but also, it was a great way for them to understand the cultural significance of this music. I received a good deal of positive feedback from parents, as well, saying that their students had a better inderstanding of the political situation in Uganda as well as a better appreciation of native folk music in general.Due to the nature of the film, I did require permission forms and I would not recommend for use with students younger than 14."
4,Limited,The Oxford Dictionary of Allusions is limited in content. I would have preferred something more complete.
4,Hidden Treasure,"It is a shame that this only seems to have been released on tape because it is one of Michal Urbaniak's better efforts from the 90's. There really isn't a clunker on it and I only rated it 4-stars because of ""What's Your Name?"", my least favorite cut. I could just as easily have said 5-stars. Being an old fan of his from New York ""back in the day"", I'm glad to see tha this turned up on Amazon. Now can someone get me the Urbaniak-Coryell recording ""The Far Side""? That was smokin' too!!"
3,Very good but........,"This is recorder is very good. It is a two peice. It comes apart at the head joint. IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE BOOK! Read what it includes carefully. I expected to get the book with it. That is why I give it only 3 stars. Otherwise it would get 5. Do not look at the picture to decide if you want it. You must read or you might be decieved. It is very difficult to see the bec on the recorder in the picture. If you want a sturdy soprano recorder, I would advise this one. It is not squeaky."
1,Not what's displayed,"I ordered this product thinking (judging from the photo) that it would be an Ipaq-specific stylus. The product actually delivered has the same product name as that listed, but is, in fact, a three-in-one (pen, pencil, stylus) instrument that can be used for any PDA. Most importantly however, it is absolutely not the product advertised here. They still don't seem to have fixed this error even though I advised them of it when I returned the product. Don't buy this - it's not what you think."
2,Huh?,"Apparently it's just me, but I find these sets sloppy and unfocused. A very nice YEM, but not worth listening to the first two discs to get to. BTW I own 8 of the first 12 volumes. I am very disappointed by this one."
2,Music ruins the show,The background/foreground music totally distracts from the awesome sounds of the F104 engines.Excellent old footage does not overcome the MUSIC.
5,esta negra was the best.,considering that this was her last album. is like a farewell to all the people who love her music.
5,Great rhythms,Fast fun salsa. I loved the earthy tone of her voice and the various rhythms mixed in.
2,Disappointed!,"I looked at this book and was very disappointed. If you are looking for the characters in color, then you may like it.I was hoping to see all the wonderful background art that is in the anime. There was nothing to speak of. Just the characters.I hope there will be more background art in future books, along with the characters."
2,Ain't no Akira,"Look, hoenstly, I really see no reason to buy this book. It's basically just a bunch of art based on the manga version of Fullmetal Alchemist thrown together. Normally this might be an interesting little novelty for the average fan but when the artwork is as lackluster and amateurish as this, its pretty much a waste of time. You won't be getting Otomo or Miyazaki here let's put it that way."
1,karaoke machine,Very disappointed in machine. Wanted the American Idol machine with 2 mic's and ordered this because it showed the cordless and 2nd microphone. Over priced for the item.
4,Decent,"This CD has the edge-of-your-seat music so fitting of the movie. I only looked into this soundtrack for the last song, Extreme Ways by Moby, which is a very catchy tune. The rest of it is good, but I personally don't enjoy listening to action-movie music without the action movie part of it. Certain soundtracks, like that of Requiem for a Dream or Braveheart, are beautiful and enjoyable to listen to on their own. This isn't my cup of tea, but it is definitely well-written music.. especially the Moby jam. ;)"
3,Great movie....same soundtrack...,"Not quite what we were hoping for in terms of the final installment for the soundtrack series. While the soundtrack maintains its proximity to the film, Powell could have gotten a bit more creative on the music selection (even a little additional tweaking). It's great to have familiarity with the original sets, but at some point, the music has to compliment the brilliant cinematography. For the fourth movie, maybe we'll see Powell craft us new chase music and brilliant originals like ""To the roof"" from the second Bourne film."
5,Bourne ultimatum,I have all the bourne movies now and like them all. Very entertaing. Lots of action in all of them.
3,"Good oil, bad bottle","The oil itself is fine, but I don't like that it comes in a regular bottle with no mechanism for ""drizzling"" it (i.e. it just pours out like water when you turn the bottle up). If you purchase this oil, my recommendation would be to plan on pouring it into a separate dispenser of some sort.I prefer the Dynasty oil because their bottles have a plastic piece in the neck, similar to what's used in soy sauce bottles, which allows you to dispense the oil slowly and in fine amounts. I've tried pouring this oil out as slowly as possible, but when I do that it just starts running down the side of the bottle. The end result is that I've used more of this in a week than I would in a month if it had a better dispensing mechanism."
1,not elastic,"This tubing is not elastic. Tubing is stiff, not flexible, and does not stretch and rebound. When stretched (with considerable effort) it does not return fully to original length and shape. I might be able to use this to siphon liquids, but definitely not as I'd intended to replace some worn elastic tubing for light resistance physical therapy exercises."
3,"Good Stuff, nothing new though","As an old Groovie Ghoulies fan, I looked forward to hearing this for a while now. It's a very good album, but if you're a GG fan looking to hear something fresh & new outta these folks, be advised that at least half of these songs are just the same old GG tunes re-recorded in an (sorta) alt-country style."
1,Why so expensive?,"Wonderful, fascinating, entertaining book --- but why so expensive?? If it's really so great, why hasn't it been reprinted at a reasonable cost to all of us baby-boomers who can't afford to waste any more money than we've already wasted?"
1,No depth or substance,"For a good look at real Self Powerment, look at Adams' Silence of the Heart. That is full of beautiful pointers to the presence within."
3,You'll Think Twice Before Biting into a Gingerbread Man!,"Gingerdead Man is nothing to to brag about as the plot is not really original. It is a combination ofChild's Play,Jack Frost, and thePuppet Mastermovies.Years after a madman, Millard Findlemeyer (played by Gary Busey), killed her father and brother, Sarah struggles to get on with her life even days after Findlemeyer was executed. His ashes was sent to his mother (aka a witch) who mixes it with gingerbread spice. The spice happens to end up at the bakery that Sarah works at with her mother.Sarah makes one big gingerbread man from the mix and brings Findlemeyer back from the dead. Now one by one, Findlemeyer kills anyone in his path as he sets to get his revenge.There are no computer special effects in the movie. What we do get is a gingerbread puppet as the killer. Yes, it is laughable. I ended up actually liking for the movie for what it was - a horror comedy, but it is only an hour long, not counting the credits."
3,obviously not good but certainly not the worst,"I am a huge fan of straight to video release and b-rated movies. I look for them almost more than I do large budget films. I saw this title and Gary Busey's name and for the laughs bought it for 2.99. I popped it in and as expected it was extremely terrible but it was funny and it kept my attention.It had some funny and great stupid one liners, the animation used for the gingerbread was laughably bad in a good way and it never took itself too seriously. the characters are all really stupid, they tell us over and over that they're trapped in a bakery but it's a very small shop and had two easily accesbile exits.This is a perfect movie to watch with a friend that the two of you can laugh at and make fun of during it's short 1 hour time lengthIf you hated this movie, it's probably not one you should have bought in the first place because who looks at this and expects a quality movie"
2,Grandson Liked It!!,"Terrible movie, but it was for my grandson and he loved it so I guess it all worked out in the end."
1,Not Enough Camp or Ridiculousness to Make It Worthwhile,"I saw this movie, with its premise of a serial killer gingerbread man, expecting it to be so bad it would be hilarious, but instead it's simply bad. The plot is squandered on the other characters who spend the large majority of the movie talking about nonsense. They talk and talk and talk... and in the end, there is so little gingerbread mayhem that I was left wondering why I wasted so much time on this."
5,Funny,"Gingerdead Man is supposed to be funny..or maybe not but the point is its for laughs and people who think their friggen movie critics need to get over themselves. Just learn to laugh at corny movies like this one. Personally, this movie was histerical and corny. It was terrible serious wise but funny wise it was awesome. LOVE THIS MOVIE."
1,what the heck happend to horror movies with inanimate objects,once again full moon has been dicki'n around with horror movies you will have a better chance at jack frost2
3,I love it!!!,"This movie sucks on so many levels, but honestly, what else could you expect? It's so bad it's funny. It's the kind of thing you watch with your buddies to have a good laugh. I don't think a little kid would even be freaked out by this flick. It's fun and dumb. If you dig bad b-movies, this is for you."
1,"Horrible, but we all knew that going into it.","Seeing this hilariously titled DVD I picked it up for rental knowing full well that it has no possibility of being good. I needed a good laugh and I got some. Like another viewer said, why would the girl use baking ingredients left mysteriously in alley that were just in a box, no seal, no plastic wrap.....When they were dropped off, how did that person know the idiot bakers would add blood to it and deliver lightning bolts to the oven to activate it? Dumb. Also, all the characters knew of the dangerous gingerbread man in the bakery but they never left to get help, it was as easy as opening the door and leaving, but no...can't do that. Poor plot, script, acting, everything was poor. This movie is obviously just for chuckles and nothing more."
1,I am disappointed...,"Well...is this movie supposed to be funny, make you laugh, then make you scream too ? It said: COMEDY / HORROR....well...I wonder why I was laughing only in ONE scene where the Butcher Baker was eating the Gingerdead Man, then said ""Got Milk ?""....Somehow I can't get the feeling that I am in the movie...it's like you watch everything then...blank....you don't know what's happening, I just can't feel the INTENSE of the actors/actresses when they were scared...To be honest..., I have never made any reviews to the movies before, even when it didn't entertain me much....but this movie is just so boring...., and I am so dissapointed."
2,Gingerdead man,"I saw this movie a really long time ago thought it was ganna be a good buy, but i was wrong it was extreamly short and boring story was dumb. I would only recommend this for a rent."
2,"This is just bad, and not in a good way","Let me preface this by saying I'm all for a good cheesy horror movie, especially ones that are entertainingly bad. And I've been a fan of Full Moon movies for a long time. That being said, this was just bad. When I heard the concept, and the fact that Gary Busey was in it, I was expecting it to be bad but in a fun way. But no, this was just bad.For the record, the sequel is MUCH more entertaining, more like what I expected this one to be."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A truly terrible horror movie which features ""walk-in ovens,"" a convoluted plot, ridiculous villain and a running length that feels long at 60 minutes, The Gingerdead Man is only spared a 1-star rating due to camp value."
1,Wrong item,"It is advertised as a 2.66MHz, but in the box is a 2.26MHz. Bad news, especially if you wanted to upgrade from 2.4 to 2.66MHz, you end up with a slower processor. I tried to make waves about this but it seems like it is still being sold the same way...Good luck if you want to purchase this processor."
5,Works fine for mowers,This item works great for filling my pushmower and weed eater for my mowing busniess. I mounted it in my pickup bed and it has good flow for these item. It doesn't fill the rider very fast though not enough hieght defference. I have another one in my shop I have about 5 FT off ground this one fills rider just fine
4,"Good toy, but not as durable as expected","This toy is great, my dog loves to fetch it, chew it, and unfortunately destroy it. We heard it was really durable, almost indestructable, but unfortunately we found that not to be the case. Our dog has separation anxiety and torn a hole into the Sqwuggie on day 2. I think for most normal dogs this would be a great toy, but if your dog has wonder jaws it won't last very long. We still throw it- it's still a great retrieval toy, but it has a hole in it and the stuffing was pulled out this morning."
2,Not so durable.,"My 40 lb dog had one apart in 10 minutes.If you're in search of a long lasting toy for a ""chewer"", don't waste your time or money with one of these."
2,Frame doesn't hold up,"I bought this laundry sorter and loved it at first. The concept is great. The frame, however, did not hold up to our family of 6. After using it a short time, the whole unit started leaning. Now it tips over completely. It was only about $18. but it only lasted a few months in good condition. Next time, I'll go for the heavy duty laundry sorter."
1,IT SUCKS!,"I purchased this item cause I am in college and the laundry room is really far from me. I've done my laundry TWICE and this thing started to wobble. It didnt even last a month and it doesnt work anymore. The wheels started to come off. For how much weight this laundry is designed to hold, the frame doesnt support it. TOo bad, such a good idea, not sturdy enough..."
2,CAN WE SAY WOBBLY?,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM BECAUSE I LIKED THE MATTE FINISH SILVER FRAME AS OPPOSED TO THE TYPICAL CHROME FRAMES ON THESE THINGS. IT'S STILL HOLDING UP FOR ME SO FAR (AFTER 2 WEEKS), BUT IT IS VERY UNSTABLE ON WOBBLY. MY HUSBAND HAS HAD TO TIGHTEN SCREWS ON IT A FEW TIMES ALREADY TO TRY AND STABLIZE IT. FOR THE MONEY I PAID, IT' OKAY. IT DOES LOOK AS I WANTED IT TO & IT DOES SERVE IT'S PURPOSE. I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW LONG IT WILL LAST."
1,terrible,this item fell apart within a few months. junk. i later bought something from target that has now lasted for two years.
2,none,I haven't put it up yet so at this time I am only disappointed with the package as delivered. The box looked as though it had been opened and retaped at least 5 times. Even a few scratches on the item.Clearly a used item advertised as new by Amazon.I have been told this is a quality LCD mount so I will stick with it rather than go through the hassle of dealing with Amazon Service.
1,HATED IT!,"Ok, I read this because I saw the trailer for the upcoming movie and it looked so damned fascinating that I sought the book out and read it. What a waste of time!If you want well-drawn characters, go read something else. If you want suspense that pulls you in till you can't stop reading, go read something else. If you want to know all the answers to all the questions the book raises, especially at the climactic ending, go read something else.There is a story in here, maybe some other writer could have given it life. Here's hoping the movie does just that, because the book was absolute garbage."
4,Blurring the Lines,"This is nearly a perfect book (like the movie). One must admire the literary qualities of the work, the wizardry with words, the way the language switched as the story moved from the past to the present and the quality of the writing. The tale captures from the first and never lets up. Unlike many novels, there are no ""down"" times but instead, the working out of a deep mystery.the introduction of ""magic"" through technological means was nifty, a cool device that made the story seem almost plausibile. Once again, that plausibility factor was heightened by the switch in language from 19th to 21st century. Some aspects continued to intrigue after the last page: Did the twins exist? Were they ""created"" in much the same way as the second magician? I was not even sure that at the last, in the midst of the snowstorm, the mystery of mysteries was finally resolved. Great saga - perfect pace, length and language."
2,Skip it. Shoot for the screenplay.,The movie producers did a heck of a job turning this book's premise into an electrifying film. Amazing considering what they had to work with.
2,Beautifuly written victorian revenge story of two battling nagicians.,"... until two thirds of the way through it limps on withouit a credible resolution and turns in to a cross between Star Trek, Dead Ringers and The Invisible Man. With a better 3rd act this could have been great. The guy can write."
2,the prestige,"it's taking forever to read; the story appeal to readers with interest in magic, the book drags and drags and and it's quite different from the movie, like always."
3,Definitely unsettling...,"I'm another one who saw the movie before reading the book. And I've never read any other books by this author.I picked this title up at a used book sale for a couple of bucks, and it's been on the shelf for ages. I just haven't been able/willing to pick it up and read it (the movie was disturbing enough lol).When I finally did read it I was surprised, and not surprised, by how it differs from the movie (but isn't that often the way?). It was a good read, twists, turns, surprises, and what an ending!Good book. Good read. Recommended."
3,"Good tribute to RLS, Poorly realized female characters","Nothing to add to the other reviews in terms of plot critique other than the magic is just too Spontaneous Generation-ish (a pile of straw and dung turns into mice kind of thinking) and I wasn't willing to suspend my disbelief. I did very much like the descriptions of the principles of stage magic that one magician offered in his diary, and the whole treatment of self is very much like Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Who is ""I"" and what have ""I"" become?However, the women in the book are cardboard cutouts, The Devoted Wife and The Scheming Mistress. (the modern woman is OK). I kept waiting for one of them to do something unexpected, but neither lady ever did. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Priest's books to see if he overcame this technical, stylistic, and most basic hurdle in character creation."
3,Mystified and disappointed,"I must say that I truly enjoyed the bulk of this book, since I like reading and seeing movies about the 1800s. The book is a bit confusing, but in a way that encourages you to keep reading to find out what's really going on. Unfortunately, the payoff never completely comes. While most of the events are explained to some extent or other, a couple of the mysteries are left dangling. The ending was abrupt and disappointing in its lack of explanation."
5,Exciting page turner,"This book had me on the edge of my seat, I could hardly put it down. The book is very well written and an old school English style that leads even better to the mystery."
4,The movie is not the book.,"I saw the movie, which led me to read the book. I liked the movie as a movie, but felt that the book was much better. I couldn't put it down. There was a lot of poetic license in the movie, which didn't bother me as long as I separated the movie from the book. I gave it 4 stars, because I was disappointed in the ending. I was left with numerous questions which were not answered.I went back and watched the movie again after finishing the book. Many of the things made more sense to me then, things that I missed the first and second viewings.The book is an exciting read. I recommend it."
3,Very good book.,"Very good book. Although I saw the movie first, and so I knew some of the plot twists going in, the book was so well-written I still ended up enjoying it.The book is actually quite different from the movie, including a whole sub-plot involving present-day descendents of the two main characters. The story is narrated first-person by several of the characters in succession. The highlight of the book is a series of diary entries by one of the characters that is quite well-crafted. It unfolds the way a real diary might, with gaps, abrupt changes of heart or circumstance, the character's convictions and doubts and emotions laid bare.I'd have to say though that the movie upstaged the book it was based on (so to speak), and if I HAD to choose, I'd recommend it over the book. Still, I'd loan my paperback out to a friend who was looking for a good read."
4,"Fast, well-written and entertaining","Interesting structure and characters. Excellent premise and very entertaining. Couldn't put it down. As the book progresses, the fantasy is introduced - thought provoking ending."
2,Didn't deliver...,"I bought this book to delve deeper into the plot from the movie. Sadly, the movie had a better developed story than the book. The main difference was the use of a very poor frame around a few diaries. The diaries felt too contrived and a lot of the magic crossed the thin line between plausable fantasy and the rediculus. It kept my interest for most of the book mainly because I kept hoping something better was coming up."
2,"Intriguing, but a little slow-paced",""" 'The Prestige' by Christopher Priest is the story of a feud between two stage magicians, around the beginning of the 20th century (mostly) in England. Rupert Angier (stage name ""The Great Danton"") and Alfred Borden (Le Professeur de la Magie) spend almost as much time retaliating against and spying on each other as they do rehearsing and improving their illusions. It all starts when Borden interrupts a seance being held by Angier. He later regrets his actions, but to Angier, it is unforgivable. The rest of their lives are spent trying to sabotage each other's shows, and when Borden begins performing an illusion he calls The New Transported Man, Angier will stop at nothing to discover the secret to the performance and improve upon it for use in his own act. ...""For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"
3,Not great writing...but a great premise,"Granted, I come to this as a result of having seen the film adaptation. (In fact, the very act of adaptation is what compelled me to read it, not the novel itself in a standalone sense.) And therefore, no matter how I've endeavoured to be objective, have found it wanting.It's a book from a genre I don't normally read, but it was enjoyable. I guess my chief complaint would be that its telling wasn't up to the premise. It was stylistically done, with great verve and a certain amount of Victorian sensibility about it, but in the end, it wasn't the 'great read' I felt it could have been, had perhaps Caleb Carr written it.Now, if you want to talk about what I felt of the adaptation to film by the Nolan brothers..."
2,"Fantasize about Magic, please","I finished the book, which is something. I read it on the high recommendations I read on this site, but now having read the book, and re-reading the reviews, I realise that the pleasure if Magic enthusiasts at seeing their subject-matter in print probably eclisped the awfulness of the book! OK, it was entertaining enough (hence 2 stars) - the writer keeps you in suspense for half the book - bravo, good showmanship. But, the PRESTIGE of his book, the big revelation, was the biggest let-down, cop-out and what I consider more dangerous, abuse of Science and insult to the Art of Illusion. Its reads like a third rate ""Beam me up Scotty"" copy. It seems the author is one of those who fell for the illusion of magic and actually believes it CAN happen, like for real. My goodness! I can only hope it was poetic license, and even then, it is hard to excuse him."
2,"Okay, just okay","I bought this book based on its review and was extremely disappointed.The basic idea and plot of The Prestige was good enough, but I'm not fond of diary-style writing at all, and was unaware that most of the book would consist of this. Priest just droned on and on about details that proved to be quite mundane in the end. The ending would have been satisfying if it was not for the extra 100 pages or so of nothing."
3,Good Bathroom Reading,"An interesting read which seems perfectly designed for bathroom reading. Each 'theory' is kept short without being too wordy or paranoid, so you don't feel like you're reading the ramblings of a crazy person. The humour in the book always kept me laughing--its obvious these guys don't take their subject seriously! Recommended, I guess, for people who don't take conspiracy theories all that seriously."
5,It's A Mad Planet,"I used to think everyone who writes about conspiracy theories was too nuts to do the subject justice, but these guys do the impossible - write an thought-provoking, well-research, ... near cultural book on the subject that is also jaw damaging funny. They know it's a mad planet and they find the humour in it. They also know that the best way to get someone thinking is to tell them the truth delivered with a punchline. I learnt a lot of history, had a lot of fun and can't wait for them to do the dirt again."
1,Complete nonsense,"This book is ridiculous. Don't even waste your money on it. According to these two morons, Herbert Hoover was the director of the FBI (yes, that is actually in there!) and every thing that has happened in the last 2000 years that is even remotely suspicous can be blamed on one of three groups: the Freemasons, the Grays, or any group from the intelligence community. They even matter-of-factly state that Jesus Christ was not crucified, but was rescued from crucifixion by his disciples, and then moved to what is now England. Give me a break. The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is well-documented in Christian, Jewish, and Roman records. Jesus moving to England and getting married is well-documented in third-rate movies. This book would be good if it shed any new insight into anything at all, but all it does is rehash things that everyone has known for years and add in a little bad humor here and there. Don't waste your time reading it."
4,Satisfies my needs,"Thermometer is accurate to only 1/10 of a Fahrenheit degree, but that's good enough for me. I find that users who use BBT to chart their temps to 1/100 get ""lost"" and don't see the big picture of following trendlines.Pros:1. Great price. Very affordable compared to other brands I saw.2. Loud beeps. I actually liked this feature since it woke me up if I had temporarily dozed off!3. Memory. If I forget to write down the temp, I can check it later with the memory recall function.The only downside is that it's not back-lit, which I would've liked to have."
3,"Reliable, but could be better","This is very reliable. I have used it for 2 months now. I don't mind it not having a backlight because I am usually getting up then anyways. I don't like that it doesn't go to 1/100s of a degree. And I also think it beeps too many times when it's done. Kind of annoying. But overall, it's good."
1,No better than a regular digital thermometer,"Does not measure to 1/100 of a degree. Is not lighted. You can not read the temp without turning on a light. Does not show last temperature taken, although it is supposed to. I compared it to my reg digital thermometer and it is inferior. At least my reg. thermometer is lit and stores the last temp. I only bought this thermometer because it was the only one offered at my local wm supercenter. It was money wasted. Also it did not say on the package that it only measured to the tenth of a degree."
5,Great storage tower. Nice features. Looks nice.,"I have one of these very nice towers already and just had to order a second one. The rack has many different potential configurations which makes it a highly versatile media storage unit for DVDs, CDs and VHS tapes. The feet of the unit has adjustable levelers which makes it much easier to make sure the unit is well balanced after assembly even on carpet. Assembly took some effort though and really needs 2 people to get everything together correctly. Overall, a great storage tower."
3,"Good, but not great","This book contains several classic jokes, and some funny jokes I never heard before. It also contains some clunkers. I suspect that reading jokes is just not as laugh-packed as watching a top comic deliver the same jokes in person."
2,amusing but not really funny,"fun stories but not really a good joke book, i didn't really laugh, i didn't find anything funny. amusing stories but nothing really to laugh out loud about. I mailed the book to my sister older than I in hopes the amusing stories would be good fun stories to help for a few seconds to get her mind off her severe pain. i really didn't like the book. a funny movie of Jerry Lewis or Robin Williams would be better."
3,Funny enough?,"My husband loves to tell jokes, so I got this for his stocking. Although he has been reading it, the jokes are not memorable enough for him to retell."
4,Laughter the Best Medicine: A Laugh-out-loud Collection,Funny and a good resource for defusing stress and frustrations. Excellent historical value as it brings back material written years ago.
4,really good book,of course Laughter is the coolest thing to me. I love laughing more than anything and this book truly had some funny things. back in the day I would read some reader's digest and there is something for you to relate to and this book hit the spot for real. i really enjoyed what this book had to offer.
4,Bamboo trays,"They don't last very long, probably due to washing. I don't leave them soaking as they would probably disintegrate, but some light washing is required, and for the price I guess it's fine that they don't last too long."
4,Delightful Read,"A delightful read for home book junkies. Even I found myself rolling my eyes from time to time at some of the commentary, I heartily recommend it. I liked the intimate way she describes her relationship with ""home"" and the process decorating. The images are elegant. Her advice is sound, no matter how your decorating taste runs. The smallish format of the book is good for reading in bed."
2,"it should be ""MY Private House""","This book is minimally instructional. It's filled with the author's memories of the small things that make life interesting--but they don't make the book interesting. This is really a poorly-organized memoir, and not a book on design. The ""tips"" that the author shares are fairly common knowledge, and it's not worth slogging through yet another paragraph on the joys of a finding a scrap of exquisite fabric in a shop in Paris after a lovely little lunch at an out-of-the-way cafe, and how lovely it looked in Mr. Insert-Name-Here's quaint chateau. Rose Tarlow should have just written her autobiography and not tried to disguise it as a design book. Two stars for the fact that it wasn't completely false advertising."
2,Rose Isn't Giving Away the Store,"Rose Tarlow knows more about art history and interior design through the centuries than any living person. Unfortunately, she really isn't interested in teaching you a thing.I read the book carefully and then went through it a second time to see if there was a single design principle or piece of advice I could come away with. Amazingly there wasn't.Rose plays her cards close to her chest."
2,Nice Photos-Not Words,"Ms. Tarlow has decidedly good taste and most of the photographs are quite lovely.However, the writing is painfully bad.To ferret out the few, good tidbits of advice, one must slog through pedestrian prose. Full of contradictions and further weighted down with the author's incredible self-absorption."
4,A Big Help,"Andy Ihnatko teaches not only the tyro Mac User,but us OLD hands(I do mean Old) easy cool stuff to do with this newest of the Macintosh cats.He makes you realize that you are really a geek at heart,and that you can really unleash Tiger's wonderful new things like Dashboard,with its widgets,or Spotlight,the amazing searcher-to mention a few.This book looks intimidating,because it's BIG and shiny.It is extremely easy to use-even for former Windows Users.It's obvious that Andy understands them.His writing is not only clear,but clever and FUNNY!When I get frustrated with computer complexity,I know I can get some laughs while looking for Andy's unfailing help."
2,Reference tool or joke book?,"For people who buy this book as a reference tool when your having problems, its just frustrating to use. Too many uneccesary words to sift through to get to the meat of it. After awhile you give up and go on to the next book you bought (if you have another). I guess for some people it could be comic relief if your frustrated about your computer messing up, but to call this book helpful, you'd have to be the computer geek type that reads manual after manual for entertainment(which I'm not), but maybe they might be able to find something in this book. To me, it was a waste of money. Good thing I also bought the Mac OSX Tiger Bible and The Missing Manual. These are much better reference tools."
2,Not as good as others,Ignores some vital parts of OS X 10.4.4 such as Garage Band. Pogue's book is better
2,"Too many ""Star Wars"" jokes and no MAC OS X","I bought this book because I though the author had a funny approach to the subject. I started reading it and I found it had a nice sense of humor. However, after reading 5 chapters and not getting any significant knowledge about MAC OS X, I felt the book really felt short of its main purpose. As a comedy book is great especially for computer geeks like me, but man...no meat on this one. The chapter on troubleshooting is basically ""DO NOTHING""....what??? Buy the missing manual from David it is a much more comprehensive book. Not as funny, but you actually get pretty good at learning MAC."
3,It's ok,There's some usefull info here. The writing style gets tiring very quickly. There are lots of fluff pieces the author uses trying to be cute or clever. It's bearable for the first chapter. After that it is really annoying. Apparently it was so annoying that I can't remember any useful tidbits that may have been stuck between somewhere. Try a book by someone not so consumed with interjecting irreverent info within.
3,Comprehensive but overly witty,"Ihnatko certainly knows the Macintosh world, but is a little too witty for his own good. After reading favorable reviews for this book I purchased it and the Dummies guide to Tiger (Mac OS 10.4) Although I've enjoyed Andy's magazine pieces, I feel his book is overly filled with his wisecracks and humorous asides, making it difficult to find certain bits of information I need to run Tiger. It's easier for me to quickly find information with the Dummies book. Perhaps the witty nature of his writing is best left to magazine columns?"
4,Very entertaining!,"I've only made it through the first 4 or 5 chapters so far, but I've found it educational and even more fun to read. I bought my first Mac in February and feel like I've been floundering a little in picking up OS X, so I found this book. I'll say that so far I've picked up quite a bit, while enjoying the authors good humor along the way."
5,Great Album,"Ed Hamell is not on MTV or the radio because the powers that be know he would destroy all of their billion dollar babyface carbon copy superstars forever. He's the real thing. Somewhere between punk and folk lies Hamell on Trial, and this latest collection is like those before it, better than anything you'll see on tomorrow night's MTV Video Music Awards. Buy this one, and then go get his other records...Ebay is a good sorce for the two that are out of print. Enjoy."
1,"Excellent Philosophy, Horrible Translation!","This is one of the most important works of modern philosophy, I suggest you read it, but please do not pick up this translation which is absolutely riddled with out-right errors. For example, in Part I Definition 2 Spinoza rights: ""The thing is called finite in its own kind which cannot be limited by another of the same nature."" This is a total blunder, it should read as it does in the original: ""The thing is called finite in its own kind which CAN be limited by another of the same nature."" This error completely misunderstands the entire premise of Spinoza's entire argument! Please pick up another edition and enjoy."
5,beyond ethics,He goes beyond ethics into our misunderstanding of freedom and warped self worth. something to read if you want to know more about ones self.
3,Where is Waihopia?,This is a very hard to find book. Many areas of this book provided excellent descriptions of the worldwide ability of intelligence agencies to eavesdrop. This includes the locations and systems description of how telecommunication data is searched using Dictionaries. A good part of the book would really interest New Zealanders as is lays out a who's who in New Zealand intelligence. Overall the book should be updated but its worth having on your bookshelf if you can find it.
4,cocoa,Pretty good. just need to get used to since it's not sweet like the cheap boxed items (you add your own sugar).
3,It's alright....,"Well i bought this because it was all Whole Foods had that was organic and I wanted a dark dutch process, I don't use it for baking I make cocoa from scratch so thats all i use it for. My cocoa had absolutely no chocolate taste, it was incredibly bland. The next day i made Hershy's cocoa from scratch and found it to be much more chocolatey than this which isn't saying much as many people seem to think Hersheys isn't that hot. Perhaps the flavor is more pronounced in bake goods, but i do like that it is not treated with chemicals as I too get migraines, but I don't think that's what gives people the migraines is the actual chocolate chemicals."
5,NOVA: Musical Minds DVD (2009),"This 56 minute presentation circles back upon the vitality and healing force of music in our lives and in the lives of 4 individuals with mental/emotional disabilities. There is clarity of thought, force of application, and determined zeal to overcome extremely difficult problems through music therapy. The ancient Greeks believed in the healing power of music and in the ethical force certain kinds of music can have on humankind. This presentation underscores all that...and more! Highly recommended for music appreciation, music history, and psychology of music courses."
1,Poor Quality manufacture,"The wall-wart power supply was of poor quality, and on weaker signals there was an audible AC hum. When switching from Wx Radio to FM Broadcast below 93 Mhz I usually got a loud buzzing instead of the radio station. The phase-locked loop (PLL) did not lock. Tuning above 93 Mhz and then down would allow reception but who wants a radio that acts that way. (I mostly listen to NPR at 91.1 Mhz.) The round ""selector"" dial was rough to operate and felt like a rusty wheel, requiring a little more force than necessary. Side volume control was rough in operation. As far as I can tell there was no way to actually turn it off, so if it were unplugged the batteries would exhaust themselves...The N.W.S. Weather radio broadcasts and S.A.M.E encoding are great. It's a shame I can't find a good quality receiver."
5,User's Manual,"This is a great tool, especially here in Florida. Lots of activity and lots of ""HURRICANES."" Great to find the user's manual on line as mine was lost in the move to Florida. Would not be without a weather radio with these features."
5,I saw Bob Last Night........,"Workbook is an awesome mainly accoustic album.I've now seen him in Husker Du, Sugar and last night solo. Just him and an electric guitar. He is one of the Greatest songwriters of our time. 'New Day Rising' has and probably always will be my favourite album ever."
4,A dramatic turn for Bob Mould,"After the frenzied pace of his first band Husker Du, Bob Mould was ready to try something different with his first solo album. Mission accomplished. Though it contains some of the punk fire that fueled the Du's best work, the best moments in ""Workbook"" are often the quiet ones. In fact, the first four tracks, three of which are mostly accoustic, are the highlights of the album. ""Sunspots"" kicks things off with a surprise instrumental and is a sign of things to come. ""Wishing Well"" is a Mould gem worthy of the Du. Things hit a high point with the achingly accoustic ""Heartbreak a Stranger"" and the more hopeful ""See a Little Light,"" which are easilly two of the best songs Bob ever wrote. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is not quite up to the pace, though it is an excellent solo debut.Overall, of all of Bob Mould's solo recordings, this one should get the nod for being the best."
5,Brilliant,I bought this album in '89 when I was 14. I bought it because I thought the cover looked interesting and it seemed to mirror feelings I was having at the time. Well the cover is ok but nothing compared to the music! It's still my fav CD and I think it always will be.
3,not bad at all,"Like many of the reviewers here, I am a long time Bouncing Souls fan. Their latest album is a definite change from earlier works, but not drastically. It is very similiar to ""Summer Vacation"", perhaps a bit more laid back. Essentially the biggest change for the band has been a new drummer and a natural progression in Greg's vocals. Their new drummer is obviously much more technically proficient, and the production of the drums on this album and the last is drastically better than previous works. The other big change is that Greg can actually sing now, and you can tell. He trys to do more vocally, and suceeds.So basically this is a record with a slicker, more professional sound from an older, professional punk bank. Personally I like it and recommend it. And yes they still put on a great live show. Lastly, if for some crazy reason you don't own any Bouncing Souls albums, you really should start with ""Manical Laughter"" which is their best work IMO."
3,...: Disapointment :...,"I'm a huge fan of the Souls.I've seen them about ten times.I have all of their CD's.That said, this CD is pretty boring. I've only listened to it a few times. So who knows, maybe it will grow on me."
5,A good supplement to the book,"I found the video to be very useful and a great addition to the book. As an earlier reviewer stated, seeing the actual exercises performed versus just reading about them, made it much clearer. I have been working at the program for just over a month and I am very impressed. Yes, it is abit on the expensive side, but I believe it is worth it. You ""will"" see results."
3,Ok Comrade!,"OK, first off, I still think this is an expensive video (only 30 minutes of info)... But, it does have some good but ADVANCED exercises for the abdominal/oblique region. I reviewed the book and suggested that people buy this video instead (if they have to) because it is better to SEE the exercises on a video than try to imagine them after reading the book.The quality of information leans towards being advanced (half of the video is spent explaining one exercise called the Junda situp). The information can come in handy but by no means is it the ultimate exerise selection as the author tries to promote it.STILL, I think his material (books, video and even the equipment he tries to sell you in the video) is way too expensive! Bottom line, if you do not really need additional abdominal exercise, skip it. For advanced athletes, it may contain A FEW valuable exercises... buy at your own discretion."
3,Good but EXPENSIVE,"This Tape or any of his PRODUCTS are WAY too expensive. Information provided is very interesting, and accurate. If you follow it, it will work. There are MANY ways to work out other than his suggestion. Find what's works for YOU individually, and STICK with it. Consistansy gives the result, just knowing wont. Try his work out and see it for yourself. I just wish he/production is not so money hungry...."
1,flabby abbys,This has to be one of the worst videos for ab work I have ever seen. All the guys does is try to see you his ab abdomizer for $200.
3,at least it doesn't pull out your hair (that much) and straigtens perfectly,"I got my item today. I immediately tried. yes it straightens your hair perfectly however if you want to use it also to curl like most of the straighteners do, you might have a hard time to do it, because to roll it you can only use the bottom part to hold and it is hard why both pressing and rolling it around hair since the top part is really hottt just like a curling iron! And it is a little bit thick so the curls have kind of weird shape, or at least I couldn't find a way, but overall it is okay. I will keep trying and if it improves I will update this review..."
2,"It was okay, not the caliber I expected","The acting was on par with what I was ready for. Sarah French, as always, is great to watch. But the stories didn't live up to the summary that I read online."
4,The Answer,"This book contains essays about personal ethics -- the decisions we make and what those decisions say about us. The author's conclusions are revealing and complex, and they lead the reader to deeper self-examination. I will re-read this book several times before I surrender it to someone else."
1,Contemplating One's Naval,"The title intrigued. The book . . . not really a book but a group of essays, one of which provided the title . . . disappointed. Spending ten pages of fine print on the exact definition of a word left me a bit angry -- angry that I do not have the courage to toss a book that I have paid for and started to read."
3,Slight Problem,"While we have many devices connected to phones and power lines in our house, guess which one has died twice in the last week due to lightning storms. Talking to a Sprint representative they confirmed that this thing is a fragile butterfly once the electron winds begin to blow."
3,Home HPNA Option (Over PhoneLine Mode) No Longer Supported,"Have used this DSL modem for several years, in the HPNA mode (internet access provided to home computers using your existing telephone wiring). Used to work well. Macintosh computers here. Have had to reset the unit occasionally, no biggie. Had to replace it once due to lightning storm-induced failure (yes, it's fragile to power surges). **** 2-Wire no longer updates the software, and it caps out at Mac OS X 10.3.9. Does not support 10.4 (Tiger) or higher, which means I can't update my Safari browser. This is now 2005-era software, and it increasingly can not handle common website features. 2Wire considers HPNA a dinosaur. Don't buy it if this is what you want to do -- at least if you're on the Macintosh platform. I don't know about Windows, but don't expect upgrades there either. I plan to keep the unit and switch over to wired ethernet or wireless mode, but am still weighing my options."
1,Hoover Savvy 7400,"After only a few months of owning the Hoover Savvy 7400, the switch became faulty. It would turn off during use and only stay on if I held the handle at a particular angle while vacuuming (not an easy task). It has now reached the point were it will not stay on at all during use. I plan on replacing the switch, but unfortunately it requires soldering. I see that I am not the only one who has had this problem. I would not recommend this product."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"This Hoover worked great for 2 months. Now, the switch has a short in it and the suction keeps turning itself off. I must play with the switch until it works, then physically hold the button ""just so"" while vacuuming for the suction to keep working. The hose is not very long, even with the extension. I will never buy another Hoover. Wind Tunnel Technology, my behind."
1,Don't buy,"I purchased a Hoover U8173-900 Savvy TurboPower 7300 Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner in September 2008, and it lasted until January 2009 - 4.5 months. I did not realize when I purchased the vacuum that the belt could only be replaced in a service center (1 hour away from my home) and of course, the belt was what needed to be replaced. I am attempting to return it to Hoover, but I'm not hopeful after reading recent reviews. My suggestion would be not to buy this item unless you are willing to have the belt repaired professionally - regularly."
5,I love this book!,My son is only 4 months old but I still read this to him every night.... I love the little devotions and they are so understandable for little toddlers. I can't wait until my son starts understanding this book as there are many Godly lessons to be learned!
5,very good,This book is filled with everyday situations kids have with relavance to Gods word. I love to read this book for my child.
5,Excellent book full of short inspirational stories,Excellent book full of short inspirational stories. I would recommend this to any catholic family. My five year old twins look forward to a new story each night!
1,Description should say this book is a Catholic version.,"I love this line of books, however, the title & description should say that this book is the Catholic version. I've ordered the non-Catholic version of this book from Amazon several times over the past few years so when I searched for it this time I assumed it was the same book with an updated cover. I was very disappointed when it arrived to find that it's a Catholic verson so I won't be able to give it as a gift as intended. Amazon needs to put that in the description so others aren't surprised when their order arrives."
1,Amazon needs to fix this description,"I ordered this book, paying close attention not to order the Catholic version, and viola, I got the Catholic version. I would love to reorder the non-catholic version, but I'm not sure how to do so."
3,blessing book review,"I ordered for my 3 yr. old daughter. I like the concept of having a blessing for each day but I thought it was an actual blessing, not a story. The book is composed of little stories and I would have liked it more if it was a blessing or even if it gave a thought of the day. This would give me an idea of something to try with my daughter. Cute book though."
1,Very disappointing,It really depends upon how you interpret the three title words. I have to agree with others here. An author should keep in mind her reputation first before collecting money from book buyers.
1,Surprisingly non rigorous,"First, the positive - this book is a very light read.However, I must agree with others here that it has very little value for practitioners of quant trading. Not because it doesn't go into valuable trading strategies or PDEs, etc, but because it doesn't add to the reader's knowledge of how to employ rigorous statistical techniques to validate the results of various strategies. It touches on some important topics but just doesn't go into enough depth.I read it as part of the CAIA curriculum and I suppose it could be a useful introduction to investors who have no familiarity with quant trading. But it seems more appropriate for a high school level intro to trading class."
2,Not Quant. Just Technical analysis,"Not a quantitative trading strategies book, as mentioned by its title. It is as mentioned by other reviewers a technical analysis guidebook."
1,CAIA should reconsider this book for their program,"I know this book because it is one of CAIA required reading for level 2 exam under the topic of quantitative trading strategies. I share other reviewer, this book is nothing but systematic reviews of some technical analysis techniques."
3,Instrumental Guitar,"Very nice guitars. The complete CD is all instrumental. If you like Peruvian Valses, then you are for a treat with this CD."
4,A version of the Foreign Service Institute public domain program,"If you are thinking of buying this you should know that it is a complete, apparently unedited, version of the U.S. State Departments Foreign Service Institute Korean courses (level I and II).These courses are public domain and are therefore distributed in many other (cheaper) forms than this nicely packaged, expensively published edition with tapes (older version) or CDs (newer version).If you can live without the hardcopy book (with very poorly typeset text) and are content to use an iPod rather than a CD player, then you can purchase the same text (as a scanned PDF) and audio (as MP3 files) on any internet auction website for about $6."
2,?,"Not good at all.1. They made a mess with all different levels of speech (friendly, casual and polite). How is a person not familiar with those levels of speech supposed to see the difference and learn to use the language in proper manner, in accordance with Korean traditions?2. Incorrect translation. For example, how come [hada] is ""speak""? And if you make people learn that [hada] is ""speak"", how would you convince them that in [dangsineun museun ireul hamnikka] [hada->hamnikka] is ""do""?3. Too much repetition. Waaaay too much."
4,its ok,"i think that the slits in the bottom are to thin, also they are 4 individual peices, water does not flow from one side of the tank to the other undr this filter. i had to cut the sides off each square. would not buy again, but i have it and made it work."
4,Good card -- poor adapter,"We are currently deploying 50+ PDA Phones that use miniSD cards. After buying 5-6 Kingston cards of various capacities, I've now had 2 of the SD adapters that do not work, right out of the box. Regardless of the position of the 'lock' switch on the adapter, my system tells me that the media is write protected. After the first bad adapter I called Kingston and they gladly replaced it but it took about a week to arrive and I'm in Southern California, just like Kingston."
3,No real Chantys but some good tunes.,"The Garrison Brothers start it off with an easy listening tune called Silver Sea. Nice pace and something you want to hum or whistle as you go alone your day. Fishermans Son,Bay of St. Ann's, Black Rock, are three tear jerkers in the 60's folk protest style. Very down. Let me fish off Cape St. Mary's is a wonderful showcase of Denis Ryan and a true Song of the Sea. Rolling On the Sea is a great tune with a wonderful beat. It's also one of those songs to put on your Mp3 player when you walk.Flow Time and Atlantic put you back in the underground pub. Sea People celebrates people who work and live by the sea. Very deep. The last three are good songs that have overtones of Gordon Lightfoot.All in all it brought me to know about The Garrison Brother and Breakin Tradition."
3,Good game - a few issues,"I am a big fan of Harry Potter, so I couldn't wait for this game to come out. I was pleased with the story line for the most part, and found the game play much the same as the Chamber of Secrets game. However, the game itself was fairly short - I completed it in just a few days time, so this might be a game that someone would rather rent and complete as opposed to purchasing. Also, I did notice a few problems with the game design itself. For example, it was difficult to keep Harry pointed in the right direction when engaged in a battle. Even when using the right trigger button to target the enemy, Harry would often be just a centimeter or two off of his mark, making some of the more difficult battles extremely frustrating. However, the story line was very good (pretty similar to the movie) and the graphics were great. I look forward to future releases."
4,Please be good...,"I am a big fan of just about everything Harry Potter, the books, the movies, everything! But the Harry Potter games that have been released have been very much middle of the road in graphics, sound, and gameplay. But now, EA is remaking Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the PS2, X-Box, and Gamecube. After its dispointing run on the PC and Playstation, this new Harry Potter game looks promising with good graphics, good sound, and good gameplay. Potter fans, let's hope that it is a great game!"
3,Clever Use of Expository Documentary,"Use of direct, seldom redundant, and intriguing material moves the text from point to point. The rare but occasional anecdotes liven the stories, but the larger picture, the carelessness of designers, the expenditure of millions on untested engineering novelties, and weaknesses in governmental supervision is impressive. I find many uses for this volume, not the least is by students whose first attempts at a bridge building or future cities competition often overlook the essential: be redundant in your design and construction. For the mass of us non-engineers and aspiring builders of the future, the book is pointed and readable."
1,Do Not Buy!! Not worth 1 star!,"This pad arrived in awful condition; it is unusable, the eggcrate was so flattened and the creases from folding do not smooth out and it is not as thick as advertised. I have ordered mattress pads by mail before and yes they do take time to expand, but this one wasn't doing it. Also, way overpriced. You will do much better buying one in store; if the one in the store isn't thick enough, just by two, you will still spend less money than on this one. I have been having difficulty returning this item to the seller (taking over a month);I do not recommend the seller either."
3,Just an okay book,Nothing exciting about this book. May be a good bed time reader if you are in the process of looking for jobs [aren't we all??? :-)]. Some common sense topics restated. But neatly written book. No complaints on that.
5,Excellent book! Truly helped me prepare for a big interview,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Not only do the authors give 50 of the most frequently asked interview questions, but they analyze each question and give a wrong and right answer. The authors also discuss the seven factors that employers look for in an employee and stories people told in interviews that demonstrated they had these qualities to get them the job. The workbook at the end of each chapter helped me to really work through my thoughts and prepare myself. I feel much more at ease about my interviews having read this book. I highly recommend it. Very up-to-date"
4,excellent book,This book is more like a motorcycle's manual for dummies and had instructions and illustrations which could allow ME to work on my bike.
5,Outstanding book,"I am a CCNA, CCDA, MCSE, MCP, Network+, etc. certified person who iscurrently persuing a career in Exploratory Testing testing printers atHP.This book was recommended to me by my test lead from SatisficeIt presents very useful information in a refreshing style thatallows you to apply it to your testing immediatly.Anyone who wantsto improve their thinking process should purchase this book, no matterhow little or how much experience you have this book is worth having:)I look forward to reading other books by Cem and crew."
5,A must-have book for SW developers and testers,"The authors have done an excellent job to explain whatquality assurance is about, and what the issues arewhen testing SW.I have known Cem Kaner and Hung Nguyen since the timewe were working together in the SW Development group atPowerUp SW Corp.(later acquired by SoftKey Int'l).Cem was also one of the reviewers of the book I'veco-authored:""SW Internationalization and Localization: An Introduction""published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, ISBN: 0-442-01498-8.Check it out at:http://www.tiziana.com/discover.html"
5,Exactly what I expected,"I received exactly what I expected in the condition in which it had been listed. Since I'd had the book before, I knew the content. I was concerned about the condition. If anything it was in better condition than the seller had stated."
3,Boring Book,"I am not sure why others have given this book such a great review. The information in it is okay though some of it is out of date, but the way it is presented is not in a way that really keeps your interest. I have read this book twice now and even now it is hard to remember what I read. I am taking a class using this book and even my instructor does not like this book and rarely refers to it.I think if the material was presented and in a more practical sort of way including maybe some code for automated testing that this would be a much better book."
2,Excellent Review of History,"If you are maintaining software created from 1979 to 1984, or creating new software based of software from this era, this is the book for you. It is an excellent review of history. It is an outstanding source of lists. If it is updated to modern software programming, programming techniques, and philosophy, it has potential."
2,Old book,"This book is fairly old. One should buy a more modern book if interested in studying software testing. They are a bit more pricy, but hey, everything has a tag to it."
5,A must for beginning and expert testers,This a great comprehensive overview of testing techniques. It is well written that it even people new to the testing will be able to understand key concepts and learn the terminology used in everyday testing environments.
4,Great introductory book for new software testers,"We are using this book at my current company to help train entry level software testers working in an Agile development environment. Even though this book was published many years ago, the concepts in here still apply in most cases to our current software testing needs."
2,Okay Survey Book but Caveat Programmer!,"I can't help but think of a scene from the movie ""Casablanca"" when I think of this book. In the scene, Louie, the prefect of police, asks Rick what brought him to Casablanca. ""I came for the waters,"" Rick says. ""But there are no waters in Casablanca,"" says Louie. ""I was misinformed,"" Rick says dryly.I, too, was misinformed about this book. From the reviews that I read, I thought that, even though the book was designed primarily for testers, a programmer could get a lot out of it. This, by and large, isn't true (unless you're a programmer for a software company). There were about four chapters in this book that were worth something and even these were more of a survey of stuff from other books rather than a comprehensive treatment. Unless you're a professional tester, find yourself another book."
3,Not my thing ... maybe yours ...,"This is a BIG fragrance with lot-o-note. It's well-rounded, well-blended and full of depth & character. A classic-type of perfume for a classy lady. It's on the sweet side due to all the white florals. Very nice if you like that kind of thing. I prefer my orientals spicier, so not my thing.Boucheron is a high quality perfume. If you like Elizabeth Taylor frags and are ready to step it up a notch, put this on your test list. Just my 2 cents."
1,small bottle instead of the 3.3 oz,"I was sent the small bottle instead of the 3.3 oz pictured here which was also pictured on the site where I bought the bottle.This was not what I thought I was ordering. If you are selling the smaller bottle then SHOW the smaller bottle.Anyway,I will not order from the person again..."
2,Poor quality product.,"I was expecting a product with the same quality than those which are sold in the big stores such as J.C. Penny or Macys. However, this perfume is pure alcohol base that evaporate in minutes. Not even my cloths or my skin keep the smell for more than 10 minutes of used.Overall the product was shipp at the expected time."
5,Great series!,"I bought this as a gift for my mom for Christmas, as she was always telling me what a great series it was when she was growing up. It's been wonderful being able to watch the series from the beginning with her - the very beginning which she didn't even remember. We were going through it so fast that I had to buy the 2nd and 3rd beginning discs for little Christmas!"
1,Dynex = Poor Quality,"Worked fine for a year or so, then noticed burned discs were starting to get ""cyclic redundancy check"" errors when used in other players. Tried different discs and they worked fine, so I know it wasn't the burner. Tried disc cleaning methods that I found online, with no success.These discs are poor quality. While DVD recordable life is often 30-100 years, Dynex makes their discs with poor materials, that's why they're cheaper.DO NOT BUY."
1,"Say 8X, but write @ 4X","This product say 8X, but when I burn data, it writes at 4X speed.I have 16X DVD writer. I tried other 8X media and they burn at 8X speed."
2,"Read with computer, but not DVD player","Burned two movies so far, both will read in the drive that burned them, but not on my DVD player. Don't have this problem with Maxell 4x DVD+R media (Burned 9, all good)."
1,Wimpy emo vocals + Pussy growl,"Ripping off death metal from sweden and thrash metal from the 80s , add in gay emo voices and you get this band.Nothing is original. It actually hurts to listen to.Why not listen to good original influential music..........Judas priest, iron maiden, metallica, megadeth, in flames, slayer, pantera, anthrax, kiss, led zeppelin, the beatles, rolling stones, cannibal corpses, the eagles, napalm death, the misfits, the sex pistols, children of bodom?"
2,Hey! I didn't know that Good Charlotte also played metal!,I saw a poster of these guys at the local music store in my neighborhood. Pop punk fashion slaves and metal don't mix. DEATH TO FALSE METAL.
1,Hot Topic fashioncore,"These guys combine the mediocrity and fashion sense of metalcore with the pretentiousness and idiocy of punk rock. The songs are all over the place. Also, M. Shadows claims that the band is heavily influenced by old school metal like Pantera, Metallica and Guns n Roses. If you ask me they sound like were influenced by the lastest trendy metalcore band that came out last week. These guys are like the little brothers of Bleeding Through (another worthless band).THEY PLAYED THE WARPED TOUR FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"
1,What the hell is this nonsense?,"i hate to admit it, but i liked this cd when it came out, but i was also younger and knew nothing about good music. the vocals on this cd are the most annoying part, his scream is whiney, and his singing reminds me of nickleback. the guitarist has some talent, but his riffs are annoying and repetative, and the drumming isn't good either, how do some people go and say ""he is the king of double bass,"" when there actually is a guy who can do 1,400 double bass hits in a minute? i can't believe how overrated this band is, because they aren't doing anything new or innovative, and certainly not groundbreaking in any way. if you want metal that actually is, go buy some cds by a band called DEATH"
5,BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The only word to come to mind when I think of this album is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Well worth any amount you pay.
5,Best Album Ever,This is my favorite album of all time. Each song is well written and the guitar work is very good.
5,A Breath of Fresh Metal,"Avenged Sevenfold's sophomore album, Waking the Fallen, is a new collection of classic metal riffs with almost eeringly grungy guitar solos. The harmony's rule and their singer, Synyster Gates, has to be one of the best singers in the metal industry today. He does it all. Screams, growls, sings, harmonizes, everything. For those of you who enjoy rocking drums, with fiery intensity and flying double kicks, then the Reverend will kick your ass. All of you out there who enjoy beautiful harmonies that possess a certain tone of beauty and heaviness combined, well, you've just found your new favorite band. With songs on the album such as Unfoly Confession, Chapter Four, Remenissions, And All Things Will End and with a little help from Godsmack producer, Mudrock, Avenged Sevenfold have proved themselves metal geniuses in this metalhead's books. A perfect metal album."
4,"Great Album, Altough The Songs Kind Of Sound All The Same...","I got a glipse of them through a commercial, and I liked it, and nothing was going to stop me from just logging onto their website and completely listening to ""Unholy Confessions"" and I continued to like it. So, I decided to buy the album with some gift card I had somewhere under my bed and realized that the album was good, but maybe they could just be a little more open minded to the melody and music, it all sounded kind of the same. But I mean it's a good record. Go nuts."
5,EVEN BETTER than their last one,"Even though Avenged Sevenfold mellowed out a LITTLE on this album compared to sounding the seventh trumpet, it's for the better. This CD reminds me of Atreyu's debut cd only better. The vocals are WAY better than their last album. This cd's one of my favorites. My favorite songs are Unholy Confessions and I Won't See You Tonight Parts I and II."
5,Best Album of the Year,"This is a revolution in hardcore/punk/metal/piano whatever. So diverse and epic that its richness doesn't fade after listening to it 100 times. If you miss out on this, you're missing a truly great album that solidifies A7X's position as one of the best bands in the world."
5,avenged sevenfold. Greatest band ever.,"Wow, what can you say about avenged sevenfold, there such a talemted band. its crazy, amazing guitar riff's, amazing vox, awesome bass, and f**king amazing drums. the reverend is by far the best drummer that is around. Hes so talented. and you all know it.If you havent heard of avenged sevenfold but are a fan of Metallica, In Flames, Pantera, you should definitly pick up ""waking the fallen"", you will be blown away after the 1st track..well 1st REAL track titled ""unholy confessions"" To those of you who boght it, rock on, to those of yu who didnt, what are yu waiting for?!Favorite tracks;unholy confessionschapter fourdescerate through reveranceand I wont see you tonight part 1&2A7X FOR LIFE!"
2,This band has no sense of identity.,"These guys aren't bad. They're a talented bunch of musicians, but they can't decide if they want to be a metal band, a hardcore band, or a punk band, so they throw elements of each in their songs. For a metal fan like myself, hearing an awesome opening riff and ripping guitar solo is awesome. I like the heavy Pantera-like breakdowns they do sometimes, but then they stick in punk choruses and punk sounding progressions and vocal harmonizations that just don't follow the form of the music. You might make a stretch and say that they are integrating melodic metal styles, but its very different. The clean vocalist doesnt have a powerful or deep enough voice for that and his voice actually reminds me of older Offspring.Avenged Sevenfold is NOT a metal band even if they have some metal sounding aspects of their music. If you want to hear current bands that are closer to real metal check out Shadows Fall, God Forbid, All That Remains, Lamb of God, and Unearth."
3,"Good in some places, but..","I have to agree with the real death metal heads: this band trys (and ultimately fails) at being a death metal band. This brew, at best, could only be categorized as ""emo-metal"" IMHO. Besides, one wonders how competent these musicians are at their instruments when EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM IS IN THE SAME KEY. (How much variety can you muster with that limitation?) Maybe they planned it that way. And if they did, perhaps they should have named their opus, the ""EEEEEEE"" CD?"
2,THIS IS NOT METAL,"This cd has lofty intentions from the get-go, but sadly falls into the neo-punk ilk, covering the normal metal standard riffs and break-downs, yet fails to present anything new for what is strives for. Buy this cd if you have never listened to metal before, and if your current punk collection lacks infantile, loosely bible based lyrics."
1,Not Even Close To Greatness,"I picked up this CD because Total Guitar magazine said that it had elements from ""every metal band you've ever loved."" Provided that one of those bands is Linkin Park, this is probably true. I'm glad to see a new band trying to be heavy, but this doesn't quite cut it. I witnessed the emergence of death metal and black metal and it seems that they ""wrote"" their songs by just sticking together a bunch of admittedly cool riffs from past acts (several Obituary riffs are prominent). The jerky lack of transitions betrays this method of writing. The vocalist is just too pre-pubescent to my ears (hence the Linkin Park connection). M. Shadows may have taken $12 of my paycheck, but I'm hoping that seven people will read this and buy something else instead...then I will be avenged sevenfold.Try As I Lay Dying for metalcore, or Emperor or Morbid Angel for metal."
5,simply unbelieveable,"i first heard remenissions and thought it was a very good song. i decided to check out the cd to see if the rest stacked up to remenissions. it truly did. this is one of the first cds i have found with a numerous number of VERY GOOD solos. the fact that the vocalist can scream, and sing very well just blew me away. that is a very rare combination and i have found very few vocalists who can match up (former vocalist from killswitch engage is one of them). this is probably the best metal cd of the year and possibly the 00's, matching up against ""Alive or Just Breathing"" from killswtich engage, and ""Through the Eyes"" from Flaw. Buy it if you like metal, especially melodic metal."
1,For douchebags only,"What I said. Learn it, live it, love it. Get a real job and move the hell out of your parents' living room and off of their sofa."
3,"ok, but not death metal","this band im not really inot but this cd is ok , but y is in it number 1 on the death metal chart, this is more like hard rock than death metal, i mean cmon. This cd is more for fans of shadows fall and staind. but this is not death metal"
4,"eh,okay yeah it's pretty good!","this is their best album along with their first album it's sucks they aren't like this anymore but m shadows made it clear that the first two albums were gonna be half screaming and half singing,and the next two just singing.Look it's not real metal altough i called the drummer real metal,but it's still great heavy music.This guys can really play i mean they really are good even tough i hate their new stuff except some few songs.Im gonna say what most people say ""if you are a true a7x fan than get their old stuff""i just think this sounds great,and what do you mean this is emo metal they said they just play METAL!"
3,Way Too Much Screaming!!,"I discovered Avenged Sevenfold through their self-titled album and really enjoyed it so I decided to pick up another one of their albums. Little did I realize that they had changed their style so drastically from where they began. Waking the Fallen has very good guitar and drums and such and usually has a very catch rhythm and melody but unfortunately the singing, er screaming, just isn't up to par. If you're a hard rock/metal fan that enjoys being able to understand the words to a song don't pick up this album. This album would have been a hundred times better if the screaming was converted even to a shout. I'm not saying he should have tried to sing like he did in City of Evil and self-title but screaming definitely isn't the answer for any band."
3,ok,"I agree to both the negative reviews for this cd. Now don't get me wrong but some songs are amazing with great guitars, BUt I find many other songs just fillers. And I did also feel that I was listening to metalica on a few of the songs(lyrics,etc). Also there isnt as much screaming as there was in the previous album."
5,Amazing Metal,"Avenged Sevenfold creates a unique breed of metal blending both screaming and singing flawlessly. The singer is amazing at both aspects and the other instruments match up to it. The guitarists put off great riffs and the drummer is incredible. Piano is also included in some songs and they pull it off well.Waking the Fallen shows much improvement from Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. The music sounds more full and the singers voice isn't as shaky.As for the whole, hardcore emo, screamo title they are sometimes given, I completely disagree. Avenged Sevenfold is pure metal and I think its a disgrace for them to be placed in any other category.Stand out tracks..Unholy ConfessionsRemenissionsI Won't See You Tonight Part I**Other than the intro, every track is amazing."
2,A view from a local UAE national,As an Emarati national living in Abu-Dhabi(Capital city) I found this book to have lot of questions that need to be answered. Certain statements the author made about the politic's of the country had either no sources or the source was not good enough to make any just assumptions (most people interviewed were either from another city in the Emirates or people who were originally from Iran)I think to make it fair Dr.Chris should have spoken to UAE nationals from the UAE and taken their perspective. Overall i would rate it as average and most of its contents are not well sourced.
5,The UAE,"This is easy to follow and has some very good diagrams. It shows that independent research can be done in countries like the UAE which most people seem to assume are still far too sensitive. There is a huge list of sources including interviews and government documents, and at the end is probably the most extensive bibliography (in English and Arabic) on this part of the world. Saudi Arabia could use a similar book."
3,Not as interesting as the others,"I was a little disappointed since I've read all her books and this wasn't as good as the others. But, it was still a good read."
4,Deadhouse is not a disappointment,Very pleased with this book by Linda fairstein. Another great mystery in New York city encased in some new York history.
1,Don't Know Or Care Who Done It,"A murder took place at the beginning of the book. The last disc (Audio book) tells how it happened, but at that point no one cares. I felt that maybe there was a bunch of short stories thrown in this book before the last disc. I am loading my iPod and removing the book without finishing the rest of it. I think it's about over. This was such a disappointment. I know I didn't read this author in order but you'd think since no introductions were needed, the main story would move along. It was plodding with all kinds of distractions and a multitude of characters and side stories that had nothing to do with anything. I don't know why I listened so long. I guess I kept hoping it would get better and wanted to know how it would get wrapped up. Well, I need not have bothered. These are the most boring characters in a continuous series ever. Words were spoken without saying anything. I will not be bothering with anything else by this author."
1,not sure what the author's intent was,"495 pages... it become almost impossible to track the main story line in this book; it is well hidden in page after page of minutiae. I really do not care what the storyteller, Alex Cooper, ate, saw at an art museum, wore, or account for a socialite lifestyle. In the first few pages, Lola Dakota is murdered. At page 361, I'm still waiting for her and Detective Mike Chapman to get through the Christmas & New Years holidays so they can get back to the story."
1,Disappointing!,"Did Linda Fairstein all of a sudden realize she had written the required number of pages for her latest book? The ending certainly feels like that. Totally unsatisfying, with lots of open ends. A start for the next book? Sorry - I really liked Ms Fairstein's books, and the characters in those books, but - I won't buy the next book. I really felt like I wasted my money this time."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of Linda Fairstein's Alex Cooper series, and I loved the first three books. The Deadhouse was a major disappointment, though. The plot was unbelievable, and it ended in a rather unsatisfying climax. One of my favourite parts of the previous books was the conversations between Alex, Mercer Wallace, and Mike Chapman. Even that was missing from this book, though, as Mercer was still recovering from being shot in the chest and Mike has fallen in love with an architect. That was the most disappointing part for me. I don't know if it was just me, but I always figured Alex would dump her annoying NBC boyfriend and end up with Mike. I'm still going to read The Bone Vault, because I liked the first books so much, but this book was a major disappointment."
3,"A lot to like, but ...","Lola Dakota is one of the most interesting characters I've encountered in a while. Though she doesn't ever appear in the book in real time (it's her demise that is the catalyst for the action), she gave the story real texture. A respected professor with more than a touch of showgirl, a liberated woman with terrible taste in men, a lover of history and a lover of wealth ... Lola was a complex woman, and it's these complexities that seem to keep sending Alex and Chapman in different directions when trying to figure out the how's and why's of her death. The plot was intricate and involving. I also liked the unexpected and moving glimpse into Chapman's personal life. Unfortunately, I could not care less about Alex and her reporter/lover. Their dialog and their big fight seemed contrived. I think the book would have been just as good (if not better) without that subplot."
4,The Dead House is definetely alive,"I thought that this book was extremely well written. The author, Linda Fairstein had great, in-depth characters as well as a good thought-out plot. It was suspenseful in a sense that you did not know what was going to happen next with the murder investigation. It is full of twists and turns and just when you think you know who did it, why they did it, and just what did happen... Another twists comes into play and you get lost again. I'd say this is a must read for suspense lovers!"
3,Egotistic DA,"Although I enjoy Ms. Fairstein's books.....I find her somewhat egotistical. She presumably is writing about someone in her own real-life occupation and she seems somewhat filled with self-admiration, self-importance, and a holier than thou attitude. She tries to be tough, but then has 5 pairs of shoes under her desk, expensive make-up and never seems to go out without a hair in place. I am glad that I neither work for or with her. She would drive me nuts!!!!!!!!!"
2,What Happened?,"What a disappointment! I loved the previous three Alex Cooper mysteries, finding them smart and compelling. I grabbed this next in the series in hardback and settled in for a great read. It read as though she knew her fans were waiting (we were), but she really didn't have the time to carefully develop the story or characters. Unlike her other works, I not only felt no connection to the characters, but none to Alex. Her relationship did not ring true with Jake, either. Bits and pieces, but nothing to hold on to....I'll be back, but please give us what the first three did! A ""can't put it down""!!"
3,Not her best,"I have been anxiously awaiting the release of another book by Linda Fairstein and I was really disappointed. Working with crime victims myself and having worked in the criminal justice field for over 20 years, cops are some of my best friends. I particularly enjoyed the easy banter between Coop and Mike Chapman - including their Final Jeopardy bet. However, this book had little banter - only a hint at the chemistry that the two keeps buried just below the surface - and a story line that put me to sleep. I had to force myself to finish the book and normally I have to force myself to put Alex Cooper books down so that I can sleep or accomplish anything at all besides finishing the book. Hopefully this is not an example of things to come - only a lull that will result in the next book being spectacular."
1,First book by this author and probably the last,"I picked this book up at a second hand shop and thought it sounded intriguing. Boy, how wrong I was. Very tediously written, anti-climactic ending, virtually no dramatic tension whatsoever and Alex Cooper, our heroine, has the best of all possible worlds - her father is a very, very wealthy surgeon; her parents have a Caribbean island home; she owns a pad on Martha's Vineyard; she lives in a chi-chi Manhattan apartment; her boyfriend is an NBC reporter/anchorman (??????); she is 5'10, blue-eyed and impossibly slender; she is Head of the Sex Crimes Unit in the Manhattan DA's office by her early 30's etc. Need I go on?"
2,The Deadhouse,"Disappointing !! This book was a non starter. The few interesting plots were never resolved, ( maybe they will be in a future book) The main story line was just NOT interesting. I never cared about any of the characters and there was not enough of Alex's private life which I always enjoy. I could have put this book down and never come back to it. But I kept expecting it to get good, based on all of her previous books. It took me 9 weeks to read this book....need I say more."
2,Couldn't relu get into it,"did you ever keep reading a book just because you had started it...I just couldn't relate to these people. Moderately interesting plot line; but I basixally didn;t CARE about tge protagonists. Sorry, won;t read the earlier ones."
3,"Better than Cold Hit, But That's Not Saying Much","""The Deadhouse,"" the fourth installment in the Alexandra Cooper mystery series, focuses on the murder of Lola Dakota, a college professor. Dakota was part of a research project that involved a building called The Deadhouse, which supposedly held buried treasure and now possible the key to her murder.""The Deadhouse"" was much better than ""Cold Hit."" I think the problem that I am having with Fairstein right now is that she is too formulaic and her ""cases"" are semi-mundane. Fairstein has selected cases that are relatively simple. There is no sizzle and intrigue to her mysteries, which is what makes a mystery! Fairstein just needs to punch things up a bit and not approach her fiction with a clinical view that a prosecutor might."
1,Brain Freeze,I wish I had thought to review some other readers comments before starting this book. This was my first read by this writer and the last. Nothing like some of the great mystery writers available to read. I found myself reading but not even absorbing what I was reading because the story just drags on and on...When I reached page 169 I kept thinking that the book would start to display more drama or intrigue but this never happened for me. What a waste of time.
3,Law Mystery,"The author and her protagonist, Alexandra Cooper, have some things in common - same job (head of the Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office), same looks (blond curls) and I wouldn't be surprised if they both bet on a US television game show. And let's not forget that both have property in Martha's Vineyard. See what I'm getting at? I don't think this series is creative - I think it's real life fictionalised, and in this case, I don't like it. (B)"
1,silly & boring,"Having never read anything by this author I picked up this book after seeing her interviewed on TV. I love good mysteries, especially the British police porcedurals, and thought maybe Fairstein might be somewhat like those. I thoroughly disliked Alex Cooper, finding her shallow and pretentious. The constant toing and froing amongst her & Mike was tedious and embarrassing(the Blondie thing has got to go) and the story just dragged on and on, and I really just lost interest. What a waster of paper!"
5,Let's value the Blaze's of this world,"I found this to be a riveting memoir of a mother's advocacy for her unique son. Sadly there are far too many parents in Debra Ginsberg's position. They are isolated in their attempts to find the best schooling situation for their children and have to follow the direction of the educational professionals who prefer to label and drug the children instead of working with them. To her credit she was able to develop wonderful relationships with many of the school officials and teachers and I think they all learned a lot from one another. This book is a fascinating chronicle of Blaze's early school experience. I hope she writes more about Blaze.Her earlier book, ""Waiting"" is fascinating reading also."
5,Wonderful!,"I have a baby with Down Syndrome and I found this book to be fabulous. Debra Ginsberg is definitely a gifted writer and I look forward to reading other books by her. Alas, the portrait she paints of the special education nightmare that awaits parents of children with disabilities is frightening. At least my eyes are open now. I wish her and Blaze all the best."
4,good book,"I am not a doctor but from reading this book about Blaze, I suspect his problems are caused by a combination of the breathing problem at birth and thimerisol (mercury) in vaccines given to babies at that time. I tried to email Ms. Ginsberg about this but her web site was down."
4,a different direction,"After reading ""Waiting"", Deborah Ginsburg's memoir of her life as a waitress I expected ""Raising Blaze"" to be a light hearted, funny little book. It's not. Blaze is the author's son, he's the sweet baby she had at the end of ""Waiting"". Blaze is different and his teachers and school psychologists have called him everything from retarded to autistic to having attention deficit disorder. This book is about Ginsburg's fight to save her son from being labeled and stuck away in special ed classes. The book is about love, Ginsburg's family is still in her corner and it's about hope, there is still no telling what Blaze will be like when he grows up. The book is emotional, it's upsetting and several points I wanted to yell at the teachers and at Ginsburg herself. I wish Ms. Ginsburg and her special son the best and I look forward to her next book."
5,excellent quality,Really well made and solid feeling. Easy to use (has good instructions too). Small enough to clip onto the fanny pack or backpack. Numbers are big enough to easily read. Looks cool too :)
2,"Not easy to use, can't recommend....","Overall, not terribly happy with this units user interface and design. The spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as ""SW1"" SW2"" etc, but they are not labeled as such on the device. You toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are (""TR"" ""CH"" what??) Just an unfreindly interface all around. Look for a better unit."
1,"Terrible, too bad I can't rate it 'zero stars.'","Don't buy this compass if you need to know any direction. If you know about where the sun sets, you will be more accurate than this ""compass."" It is impossible to use in the field. A waste of money: inaccurate to the max, impossible to maintain it level, etc. Just junk. They should give them away."
1,Worst product,"Unfortunately ,I purchased this product . Thermometer and compass are not at all working. Thermometer always shows 65 F and Compass allways shows Err. I highly recommend NOT to buy this one"
2,Works well unless you're under water,"Bought mine sometime around Christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to St Thomas last week. It died within 10 minutes of being in the water. It was never more than 5' down while I was snorkeling.While I never tested the compass or thermometer against known ""accurate"" ones, it seemed to work well enough for my purposes. Just keep it dry."
1,Read This,"I have not purchased this item. It was selling in the National Geographic catalog for $49.95, so I was interested to look at it here, until I saw all the negative reviews. I tried going to the manufacturer's website to ask them to explain, or defend the product.A VERY BAD SIGN: their websites contact form made me jump through all the hoops, then sent an error message stating that this portion of the site is ""down"" but that their engineers are ""working hard"" on the problem.Yeah, right. I bet the part of the website that takes your money is working just fine...."
2,Title Track makes the CD,Still Alive is wonderful song and perfect for crusin' under the sun. The rest of the songs on the CD did not meet the same mark set by Still Alive.
5,Cool!,"One day, while ordering to a deli, Stacey keeps on drinking water and her Father realizes that she's not sticking to her diet."
1,This book is not medically accurate,"The events of this book cannot happen! Martin makes it sound like diabetics can get sick no matter how carefully they take care of themselves, and that is simply not true. Anyone who takes their insulin properly and controls their blood sugar will be fine unless something else, like an infection, is going on. While the book does mention that Stacey had the flu recently, it is inaccurate because if that were to throw her blood sugar off, it would have happened while she was sick, not after. Also, why can't she eat sweets? Diabetics can eat anything they want as long as they plan for it and give themselves the proper amount of insulin. Simply put, the basic plot of this book is an impossibility!"
4,"""Stacey's Emergency"" - review","Stacey McGill is 13 and has had diabetes since the age of 11. But she's fed up of dealing with it and starts eating chocolate whenever she feels like it. Then she ends up in hospital and has to face with her condition. If you like this book, or like it but think it's slightly childish, read: ""All The Days of Her Life"" by Lurlene McDaniel, about a 16-year-old diabetic who also doesn't want to deal with her illness"
5,"""The performances on the CD are really fantastic.","""The performances on the CD are really fantastic. Your vocals overall are great and powerful, but that stuff on Bobbi McGee is crazy good. Like, holy crap, I can't believe she's singing all that stuff and nailing it. That kind of good. And Michael is a very cool guitarist who has really mastered the blues. Congrats, you should be really proud! It definitely makes me want to see you guys live."" Tom McCarthy"
3,Dialogues With Double Bass,"I bought this CD primarily for the recording of Elgar's Duet for Double bass and trombone. It contains a very wide variety of music, all of it good: however, because of the variety it is not often I feel like sitting down and listening to it in one sitting. It is more of a ""dip into"" CD.Overall, tho, a very fine CD which shows off some of the textures available to the double bass."
2,Not for younger children,"I purchased this for my 18 month old only for the reusable stickers part of the book. The pages to stick them on are too busy and they match the stickers colors and scenes. It is hard to tell where the stickers are and its boring. There is 5 pages of a story and 12 pages of puzzles. Approximately 60 reusable stickers ranging in size from 1/2"" - 3-1/2"" long. There are 3 -2 page scenes to use the reusable stickers. I will put it away and bring it out later and see if it has better results."
2,3 y/o not too interested,"Bought it for my 3.5 y/o girl. Played with it one time for 1/2 hr, that's it. She likes stickers, but I guess she just wasn't into sticker books. Pro: The stickers are vinyl, so didn't have to worry about it tearing."
4,Good Christmas Video,"It has many good ideas for setting up outdoor christmas lights, besides just a nice pleasant viewing for the holidays"
3,Music is ehh... Lights are ehh..,"It's OK. My husband and I do our our awesome lights display each year. I was expecting some amazing displays from all over the country... This kind of looks like someone went out driving through their own personal neighboorhood to make this film. Some of the displays are great, others are like a few lights strung over the bushes in the front yard and a sickly looking reindeer. Not very well done. There are 2 music options: The first one is pretty standard traditional type, the other is more twangy... and, in my opinion Ehhh.... For lack of a better word the whole DVD is just Ehhh.... it's ok."
3,It's okay,There are only two forms of music--jazz and country western. I thought there would be something traditional. I have to add three more words. Why?????
5,Neat concept,"Lots of bang for the buck. As far as the jazzy music, its alright. The video made for a nice background screne. Not sure you could sit down to watch this from start to finish. But, great when coming and going, while getting Christmas meals ready and all."
4,Toe Taping Blues Music,This is a very good selection of soulful blues music. Good guitar and some soulful harmonica -
2,Too few Sounds of Nova Scotia,"This is the inferior issue of the three anthologies. To begin with it only has 10 different cuts on the CD. It is neither tradititional like volume 1 nor revisional like volume 3. In my opinion this seems to be a ""rush job"" to reap any residual benefits from the success of volume 1. If you enjoy this music, buy volume 1 then volume 3 and buy this one only if you still want more."
3,A good CD,"I bought this disc for one song, Cape Breton Lullaby. The disc is mostly forgettable unless you are looking for something particular on it, or have a great interest in the music of the region. It really does show the Gaelic roots of the region."
4,Reminders of a wonderful place,"We bought this album when we were in Nova Scotia camping, and it remains a fresh and happy reminder of the place and our experience of Atlantic Canada. Musicians we might not have heard otherwise, bring a welcome change from the ""usual."""
4,The start of a new era!,"When Bendis disassembled the Avengers, he became the most hated man in comics. He made it up to the fans by starting this series! It all begins when Electro is hired by a mysterious group to infiltrate the Raft, a super-secret prison for supervillains right next to Ryker's island. During the chaos of the prison break, Captain America and Iron-Man are joined by Spider-Man, Wolverine, Luke Cage, Spider-woman and the Sentry! Seeing the potential in this new squad, Cap decides to reform the Avengers! It's not long until this new band of heroes is off into the Savage Land, where they discover the conspiracy of the prison break runs deeper than they thought! (It would be several years until they learned how deep the conspiracy truly ran!) If you're not a fan of Bendis, then stay away from this series! All others will enjoy this new start of the Avengers legacy, which includes art by David Finch!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The start of the new title, and it is decompressed to pieces. Like a 2-3 minute read or so. A bad guy realises that the supervillain jail has a vulnerability, its power source. Electro is hired to take advantage, and all hell breaks loose. Matt Murdoch is there visiting, escorted by Jessica Drew and Luke Cage.A few other heroes see what is going on and head there is well, ending up with a rather ludicrous Avengers team made up to bring the most popular Marvel heroes together in a group, mostly."
4,Good Aid for Better Understanding of the Holy Bible,"Sterett has written an excellent aid full of details that will prove invaluable for the person who is serious about going deeper into God's Word.Among the points covered include:1. Be careful of pride - we need to be humble before the Lord when studying His Word.2. Suggestions for Bible study and what to observe.3. Things to know about grammar usage in the Bible.4. Historical, georgraphical, and cultural elements in the Bible.5. Different types of figures of speech.6. Guidelines for interpreting types, parables, allegory, prophecy, and poetry.7. Interpreting the context of a passage.8. Finding the purpose and plan of a particular book.Read and use this title as a valuable tool for better understanding God's Word.Highly recommeded!"
4,Benefits discus,"A great product noticeable when used with RO water (that's all I use); big drawback it's expensive. It is not essential for keeping discus if you use RO right; but if you want to breed it helps as well as black water (Kent). I use it with all my discus, my biggest expense running 1200 gallons of discus."
2,Folding Laundry Cart,"Little flimsy. Needs stronger parts, especially when opened and in use. Particularly, strap holding open. Laundry canvas bag need to have a better system to keep in place."
4,Basically satisfied-,"My hampers (I needed 3) are as pictured and described and are serving their purpose for basement laundry-sorting and conveyance. I would inform potential buyers that at $24.99, the cost of ""free"" shipping has probably been built in. As noted by another reviewer, the 4 included Phillps screws proved too large for their holes; only a minor problem since we happened to have the right size on hand."
1,Too Light Weight,Didn't think it would be so flimzy!Not for real heavy loads rolling over unsmooth surfaces.Flat crossbar shown in photo not there... only round tubing supports long side. Cloth bag isn't 3/4 the depth of photo.Poor investment.
2,Not Too Sturdy,"Product was shipped immediately and arrived in excellent condition. It was not too difficult to put together.As to the product itself, it is not too sturdy and will not hold up to regular rigorous use. The biggest problem with it (that has been noted by other reviewers) is that the cloth bag slides around on the chrome and will not stay in place. To get the bag to stay in place, I had to sew Velcro on it and then glue Velcro on the chrome sides. If I had seen this in a store, I would not have purchased it."
4,Understanding,"I was reading the other reviews and all of them trash on Falls City. I know that the people in my town were portrayed as white trash and lowlifes, and they really are the worst of the worst. However, judging the entire town by this documentary is unfair. Very few people in Falls City are actually so terrible. And you have to understand that the majority of the town is 60+ years of age, so they came from a different time when gender bending and cross dressing we're ever talked about. I myself am a lesbian and have never been the target of any violence, sure i've heard some insults, but nothing terrible... i just wanted to try to express that you can't judge an entire town by the worst of its population... thank you"
4,devastated!!,"i saw the movie over the weekend on cable and i was so upset by the end of the movie i could not sleep. during the moving i thought it was great that she could find someone that she could be herself with. i was really hoping that in the movie she wouldve been ablbe to be with the girl that accepted her. i can not believe or understand how some people can be so cruel and do those things to another human just because they dont agree with her lifestyle. if you see this movie is such and eye opener that we still have people in the world that could be so cruel just because they did not agree with her lifestyle. i see it this way, the people that dont agree with that type of lifestyle should just choose not associate with it. i think it gives no one the right to kill someone just because they dont like it. it is so scary that we have to live in such a dangerous world and hide who you truly are just because the public says so."
4,Nice complement to Boys Don't Cry,"I saw Boys Don't Cry first, and because of that, the documentary did a good job of further fleshing out characters and background. I question whether it would be as effective on its own. One thing it does very well is shine a light under the rock to reveal the festering ooze that is life in rural Nebraska. The movie did a good job, but even an independent film glosses up the wretched stupidity on display here."
4,The TRUE Facts,"I have seen ""Boys Dont Cry"". (VERY good, recamended) And read the book. ""All she wonted"", But this movie ""THE BRANBON TENNA STORY"". Is the best because it tells alot of true facts. It shows great photos, and real interviews with the real people from falls city who knew Brandon. his gfs, his mother, his friends, ect. I Recamend this movie very highly if you want to get the facts strate!"
3,Disturbing,"I liked this Movie...BUT..It was very disturbing to me, That this actually happened to this poor Girl! It left me a little disheartened By How we treat people who are different. The story is slow at times..But A good rent!"
4,"Really, really good","I've always wondered what it would be like to be inside the homes of people on the ""Jerry Springer Show."" Now I know. The people in this movie are so out of hand that you have to see it. I know that it is a sad story and all, and I cried through the whole movie. They weren't sad tears, however; they tears from histerical laughter. If you like this one, you'll love ""Paradise Lost."""
3,Perfect for taking photos of things,"This review is based on the non-flash version, but i want to get my hands on this one asap.The Holga - what to say. A bad plastic lens, somewhat shoddy plastic construction, creates an almost disposable 120 camera. So, why would i give it any stars and own many?Well, the bad plastic lens can also produce some of the most beautiful images ever. Dreamy looking especially because the edges are so soft and distorted.Plus using 120 film allows you to actually blow them up some without showing too much grain.one last note - once, when shooting a wedding, i brought my Holga along for a few fun shots. They came out great, and i actually got more orders for reprints from that roll than any other. Neat."
3,How do you load the film?,"Somebody tell me! I want to experiment with this camera but am a fool, apparently."
3,Well Worth the Investment,"A carefully researched book about the early submarine service. An important book for historians, it is not terribly well written."
1,Bad product copy and Wrong picture shown,The product copy describes a socket 939 processor and the picture is of a socket 939 processor. What you get is a socket AM2. I suggest buying a processor only from a vendor who can give you the serial number.
1,not a socket 939,"i was very excited today to have receive the processor for my socket 939 motherboard. when i opened the package i was disappointed to discover that i had been sent a socket AM2 processor instead. it was a great price, i guess too good to be true. if you have a socket AM2 motherboard i highly suggest jumping on this deal."
1,Frustrating,"When I received my item it was not the one I ordered, it had a different socket number, so it did not fit in my tower. I tried contacting the merchant for exchange or refund with no replies at all. I finally had to contact Amazon to see if they could do anything I am still awaiting their decision to see if I will be getting the correct item or a refund. This experience has been very frustrating and I still do not have the part I need to get my computer up and running again."
5,Revealing!,This book shows a realistic view of our human nature and provided me with more intelligent insight to understanding my life. I recommend that men read this as well.
5,Every bit like school.,"I used this for an online Illustrator class and was impressed. Not unlike a classroom setting, you do moan and groan as you plod through the lessons. The reward is that you do learn quite a bit. Each tool is explained along with a basic technique. After that, the creativity and vision is up to you. This is a great starting point for the program, even if you are arrogant enough to believe you can 'figure it out'."
2,Not for the Beginner,"While some of the exercises may be helpful to some users, beginners will get lost in quite a few places. I managed fine because not only am I a bit past intermediate skills, but I have many years' experience as a senior tech writer. The problem is one that started several years' ago with the Adobe books, which used to be excellent.In addition to dozens of typographical errors, steps are often missing and some are even wrong. I pointed out this problem to Adobe with their first release of the ""Classroom"" book for InDesign. Guess they're not listening because the volume for Illustrator CS is definitely not worth the money. Pick out one of the other well-reviewed volumes.Don't buy this one!"
4,Classroom in a book,Adobe do it again. Very useful and comprehensive guide to Illustrator CS2. Fun to work through with great attention to detail. Always my first choice for learning a new application..
3,Illustrator,"I bought this book because it was required for a graphic art class. We went through the first 5 chapters, and now we are going to learn Photoshop. It is not good as a reference book, but more as a step-by-step ""cookbook"". The accompanying CD was very helpful in learning techniques. Anyone want to buy it from me?"
3,"An R&B/house music jam, very few highlights","""Big Fun"" and ""Good Life"" actually make this album worth a listen. While the other songs here don't hit the body like the two hits mentioned, you're still gonna move somethin' to Inner City."
4,I like the show,this is a show on Spike TV were a man and woman come on a reality show for a date they don't know each other that's why it's called blind date. during the show the camera do these special effects like putting words on the screen they love poking fun at the guys which is not fair. The host is Roger Lodge. Their is nudity in this video it is uncensord on the dvd.
3,"Worth viewing for the ""dates from hell"" dvd","I was disgusted by the ""uncensored"" dvd which is little more than people stripping and having ( the scenes are R rated) sex with strangers they just met. But wait until you see, ""Dates from hell""! There is no sex on that dvd - just awful, evil, vile, meanspirited men and women out on dates and cruelly attacking each other, showing what lowlifes they are, making it clear where the next generation of monsters in politics and business are coming from. It is enough to make you stay inside with your doors locked rather than risk meeting one of these creeps in a bar!"
2,a waste of money,"This DVD set is not worth it. If you are a fan of trash TV, this series was very entertaining. The low-lifes, morons and jerks were a lot of fun to watch. This DVD set is poorly edited and jumps around from scene to scene without any connecting threads. There is less than an hour per DVD which is a rip-off. Save your money unless you are desperate for mindless, moronic trash TV."
2,Blind Date Uncensored 3 pack,"I thought that only the one of the videos was cool. Dates from hell was the dumbest, along with weirdos and [strange folk]. I wish other dating shows would come out with some DVD's like this---anybody know of any???Buy if you want, some parts are pretty funny."
2,channels easily changed....,"For an FRS unit, it is not bad. My only problem with this unit is that you have no channel lock. If you accidentally bump the channel changer, you will not hear anyone trying to contact you."
1,Senco Electric Nailer,"This nailer will not set the nail. Use the shortest nails, it still will you unhappy.Don't waste your good money."
5,A resource treasury for homescoolers and teachers alike,Mary Pride has researched tons of educational products and compiled her findings for preschool and elementary products in this book. I love Pride's philosophy of teaching and trust her conclusions. She has saved me years of hunting for good educational supplies.
4,What are you looking for?,"I first picked up on Flew after reading ""Does God Exist?"" This book devotes a lot of time to western christian thinking relative to God, the immortaility of the soul, etc. My educational understanding of many of the arguments by secular and religous giants of the past was very shallow. He covers the subject from Plato, to Aristotle, to Augustine, to John Edwards. If you want to research the doctrine of ""predesination"" and whether there is such a thing as ""free will"", this is a great book. Flew, being an atheist, has some very logical arguments against belief in God, and points out many of the weaknesses in arguments for God. If you want to sharpen your understanding of the 2000 year old discussions on these subjects, I would suggest you add it to your library. It is a great resource book for teaching and understanding. A great deal of western philosophy is the study of God and religion."
5,*Dive into a good book*,"Diving for the Moon is the best book ever written, and that i've ever read!! I would recomend this book for ages 9-11. It's a very sad book, but that's what makes it so good. It's suspenseful, in everyway.Easpecially when- well you have to read the book to find out. All I will tell you is that there is one very big surprise in the book. Again I would sooo recomend this book"
5,Super helpful book,I just started using Live Stage Pro to author quicktimes 2 months ago and found the software's manual to be helpful but light on insight. In a nutshell 'Interactive Quicktime' is a crucial book to get if you're learning LSP (although the author goes into other methods of working with quicktime too). What can I say? It helps you understand what's going on within the world of the quicktime architecture and walks you through tons of projects to help you get it. I wasn't getting it with the LSP manual. As the author states it would be helpful to know a little bit of applescript or some other programming language but I'm picking it up slowly but surly and I've never written a word of code in my life. It's well worth the price.
4,Excellent series,"Love this series of books. I have been reading them to my children and now grandchildren since 1978. I look forward to completing my collection. by the way, why is the one on Jacques Cousteau so darned pricey?"
4,"Different, thought provoking and well written","Reasons Why is an albumn that you put the head phones on and listen to when you need to escape. The emotions are all here. Joy, sadness, anger. The music is awesome, the vocals powerful. The musicians play it tight and the production value is very good. My favorites are ""NOT the END"", a hard, gritty, powerful song with crunching guitars and ""Captiva"" a mellow ride that takes me to sometime and somewhere else. Larry and his band have a passion for music and it shows. I have just recieved thier new album ""Changes"", also excellent."
5,Fit the need!,"As has been noted in other reviews, this product is ideal for a situation when the door does not fit snuggly against the jam. My door shows nearly a half inch warp but is otherwise is good shape. This product worked perfectly!"
3,Fine,It's fine. I'll show you some stuff on how to do a massage. Keep your money - rub your hands around your partner a bit. I'm sure he'll/she'll like it.
2,Dated documentary,"My hope was that this video would provide some details and instruction about sensual/tantric massage, but it was quite a let down. Half of this 45 minute documentary focuses on how repressed we've been as a society when it comes to physical touch, showing clips from old black and white movies in an attempt to exaggerate how far we've come.While I was able to move beyond the ""unlandscaped"" appearance of the actors and actresses in this DVD, I didn't find anything about it that would allow me to give it more than two stars. While the nudity is prevelant (and tasteful), if you're hoping to learn more about how to massage your partner's genitals, this is not the video for you."
1,The art of sensual massage,"This DVD was severely disappointing and expensive. Laura Corn should check out what she suggests in her ""101 Grrreat Romantic Nights"" book before listing items to purchase. The DVD touts that it will teach you the Art of Sensual Massage, when really its just an over-priced 1970s-looking Asian porn! The music is clunky, not mood provoking, the actors(?) make you cringe as you watch it and the instruction was hopeless. It seemed like a backyard-made budget DVD that we could have written better ourselves."
3,"Good information, but dated video","I found the information in both the book and video very useful. The biggest drawback was despite the 2006 copyright, the video and photographs appears to be unchanged from the 1970s. The hippies, vinyl records, wide tan lines, bell bottoms, and `70s hair styles made the video a time capsule worth watching unto it self. The video and book also fail to discuss modern massage oils instead recommending vegetable oil. However, the most important message, how to give a sensual massage, is the same in any decade. We have spent several wonderful evening practicing the touching techniques taught in both the video and book."
1,Just do even think about it.,"This film was created 50 years ago, it is not even interesting for today's way of life. The actors don't even show any kind of techniques that you can follow. Don't waste your time and money."
1,Low quality. Very little new. Standard massage.,There are two parts to my unhappiness.First. The video itself is outdated and presents nothing that would not be covered in any instructional video of massage. Nothing more sensual about it than any gentle massage. Much of the beginning is taken up with explanation and condemnation of societal distortions. Nothing anyone who is interested in sensual massage doesn't already know.Second: The video quality was very poor. It was far below what I get with Youtube and Vimeo. I have watched videos from hula and Netflix and they were all better. Also the header and footer which occupied much of the screen added to the problem.
1,Pretty old looking,Was hoping to find a gem in the rough but this is pretty dated material. or at least the presenation makes it seem so.
1,I'd pass on this,I'd passThe description doesn't seem to match up. I didnt learn a lot and I dotn think it lived up to waht it looked like in the cover.
2,Zero stars if you have any experience with massage.,Not what I expected. All it consists of is naked people massaging each other in a regular way. There wasn't anything sensual about it in my opinion.
2,Throw back to the 60's,I was disappointed in the overall presentation and content. Although the actual instructions on giving a full body massage is good I felt like I was being transported back to the 60's or 70's.The massage part of the video was not originally made in 2010 it was clearly made 30-40 years ago. The educational history of massage was boring and seem like a time killer to fill 45 minutes. This video would have been much better if they had updated the content to 21st century material.
3,Nothing special,"I give this a 3 stars rating. I am disappointed. I think that this movie was made in the 70th, and its content does not reflect its title. For me it was just a waste of my time."
1,don't waste your money,do not waste your money. go to the library and rent any dvd on massage you see the same thing.
2,Let down by this album,I am a big Wynton Marsalis fan. I have many of his recordings going back to the earliest ones. I love all of them. This one does not work for me. Wynton has always been willing to speak about the problems of the world. This time it gets in the way of the music. I am not against music trying to make a statement but it needs to also be good music first.I can't wait for the next Wynton release and hope he remembers to record some more of the wonderful music hea ha made in the past.
3,Pity about the lyrics,"I did not realise the CD had a singer when I purchased it. Jennifer Sanon is a pleasure to hear and suceeds in spite of the lyrics. The title track is just plain awful, but from then on things improve. It is nice to hear something new and living after all."
3,out of tune?,"My last purchase of a Marsalis CD,before this, was ""With the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra"",which was a fine recording,in my opinion.I'm a little disappointed by ""From the Plantation..."",perhaps because Wynton Marsalis has set such high standards in his performances,which I did not find in this record. The vocals in the first track,and taking nothing away from Jennifer Sanon(she's very good on tracks 4 and 5),sounds a bit out of tune,to my ears. She may have done it purposefully(as in one tune from the soundtrack of ""New York, New York""),still I would take it out. Perhaps, her voice is a little thin for those passages? As for the rest,I've found little Marsalis in the whole recording: it may well be that my expectations were a little too high for this CD: out of tune?"
3,Sort of pleased,"I am no authority on jazz. I likje parts of this recording, especially the final track. Some parts are too, what shall I say, refined jazz (?!). I want to like it, but end up confused by some of the music. I guess I need to listen to it more! Wynton has something to say here on a subject that is very important."
3,It works - in a fashion,"Recently got this item - it works on every third or fourth bounce, so I guess that isn't too bad if you have a pair of stairs to toss the ball down (which we do). But the poor dog drops the ball repeatedly trying to light it up - and soon loses interest because it won't work every time. Like people, some dogs need instant gratification.The thing lights up and makes a variety of cheap-o electronic sounds as it flashes. There is a small hole on one side, not much bigger than the head of a pin for the sound to come out of.Aside from the bounce factor (I've seen children's toy balls similar to this the light up on every bounce) is the fact that this thing is solid and heavy. No doubt to protect the electronics, but it is much denser than a tennis ball - and sounds like a rock going down the stairs. It is bouncier than a billiard ball."
4,Great toy for a less destructive dog,"I have a Boston Terrier that is bound and determine to destroy his toys. He managed (in less than a day) to turn this ball into a weird oblong shape and destroy the sound mechanism. It still lights up though so we could play with it at night. So, if your dog doesn't have teeth that could gnaw through cement, then this is a great toy."
1,Not worth it,"On the very first toss, my beagle chomped on this ball and separated the two halves. To be fair- the package says ""Not a chew toy"", but does anybody have a dog that doesn't bite on their toys? The idea of this product is a good idea. The implementation is poor."
1,Could be fun,This product lasted for about 2 hours of total play with our dog. The ball is very durable but the light and sound function was broken after only playing with it for a VERY short time. Not worth the price AT ALL!
4,laser flashing ball,"My dog loves this toy. It's the only toy he will play with (my other dog plays with anything and everything). This one...only this toy. I got him from someone else, and he came with this toy. He played with it so much, it got destroyed. I couldn't find it anywhere in my town, so I went to trusty Amazon to find it. And, waala! there it was. My Kacey is a happy guy again. ;o)The ball makes noises kinda like an alien, and it flashes. It gets a little annoying at times, so I put it away to save my sanity. But, again, Kacey is a happy guy now that he has his ball again. So it's worth a little annoyance here and there."
1,not happy,I have been buying these balls for year in stores and this time I ordered the same balls for my dogs on line. After playing with the balls for about five min. I picked up the ball and the seam was open I took it away from them( I had ordered four balls) and I gave them another one the same thing happened I will never ordered them again on line .I went to the store I have always gotten the balls from payed more money and the balls are great they are safe for my dog I GAVE onestar for these balls unsafe for my dogs Very disapointed
1,Very poor,I had a ball similer to this that I bought at another website that was great. This ball came apart within the first to second time my dog played with it. I bought two & neither lasted. I would never recommend buying this ball.I should have payed attention to other reviews.
1,Waste of money.,It lasted a whole 10 minutes till my dog had it in pieces. Might work better as a cat toy.
3,Love the ball - not all work for very long!!,My pup LOVES this ball - when it works. We bought 5!! Sadly only 1 is working now. The one that works broke open and cannot be used. Disappointed.
2,Fun & Exercise,This was a Christmas gift for a friend's scotty. He was not too happy with this ball. I think because the sound is high pitched.
1,didn't last more than 2 hours,"i have a small pit bull, she had it broke in less that 2 hours, i was not happy over the quality and durability of this product. i have other ball toys that were far more durable. also it split open revealing potentialy choking parts. i don't recommend this"
2,Product didn't work,Not sure if it was broken prior to getting it but I bounced the ball as hard as I could on the floor and it still would not light up. If the ball was functional there is no way my dog would be able to slam the ball with enough force to make it work.
1,Lots of fun for 5 minutes,"Our first couple of Zap balls lasted months. We bought six not long ago, a few to give as gifts. Three in a row lasted only about 5 minutes before our dogs broke them in half. Our friends had the same experience. The dogs love them for 5 minutes -- literally 5 minutes. No longer a good buy. Too bad."
2,Dog toy Caution,"My dog loves toys that blink wink and make noise. He loves to chase this type of object. However, the construction of this items last all of 5 seconds. My dog grabbed it one time and squeezed and the item fell apart. This item is definitely for a little dog with a small mouth any dog bigger it is a waste of money."
1,So Disappointed,"I bought 2 last month, thinking they would be of the same quality of one I purchased 5 years ago, (that still works!)Unfortunately, the new ones are of inferior rubber/plastic, and the quality of the construction has also diminished.The first one lasted only three days, and the second one even less.First the electronic devices give up and rattle around inside, then the balls become oblong, and then the seam starts to fail.I really loved the concept, but I won't be buying these again.Ethical Laser Flashing Ball Dog Toy with Sound, 2-1/2-Inch"
1,ZAP or ZIP Ball???,Received it today. Does not make a sound & may or maynot light up. Returning it asap. Don't waste your time or money.
4,The dogs love it!!!,I have two Golden Retrievers and a Labrador Retriever. They LOVE this thing. They love to toss it around and get it to make noises. They play with it by themselves rather than needing to have me throw it for them. I'm buying more.
3,Not for chewers!,"My Boston Terrier likes to chew her toys, and this one is now splitting down the seams. We've super-glued it back together twice, but it doesn't hold. She does like the lights and sounds, but it's only for supervised play now."
2,OK but not durable,"OK weight and easy to fetch for the dogs, but the lights dont stay on long enough and the thing falls to pieces within a week"
1,don't buy it,"Although the concept is good, our dog (terrier) had the ball in half in about 10 minutes; in the garbage it went."
1,This product is a fraud.,"I'm not sure what this is but it's not uilleann music. I am very surprised Amazon is selling this product. The first song or two sounds like an uilleann pipe but everything else is midi and god awful. I listened to the songs with names I know on the cd and these are most definitely not the songs in the title. The main reason I bought this product is there is a corresponding book with the same songs however the book is crap too.Short story... don't buy, move along.I returned it the same day I bought it."
5,can't beat the rhymes,My 3-years old granddaughter loves to participate in completing the rhymes and has become attached to more of the Madeline books.
1,Lethally Dull,"The premise of this movie is seemingly solid, and it begins like ""28 Days Later"" Animal Rights Activists break in to a lab and free the cute and fuzzy bunnies. One of them gets captured, and then it turns into some kind of ""Altered States"" heist movie.Seems our Activists are now set on freeing their captured comrade from the lab where he has become the focus of a new experiment that is gradually stripping away his humanity in a ""Lawnmower Man"" kind of way.Sounds cool, right? That's what I thought. The problem is that once the heist portion of the movie starts, it goes nowhere fast. There's a lot of pointless screaming as members of the crew start turning on each other. It's another entry into the current string of U.K. funded programming that features people turning on each other. For more of the same, watch ""The Bunker"". The Bad Guy doesn't make an appearance until the last ten minutes of the movie, and it's a pretty dull ride up to that point."
5,Good,Movie is interesting and different. For a lower budget movie I think they did very well with it. I enjoyed it :)
3,I have no idea what was going on but....,"The film is a typical super-low budget sci-fi horror flick. They're in an underground bunker maze thing and they all start getting knocked off one by one. I actually watched it twice and still have no idea what was going on with the magnets and the electricity and the weird noise that caused people to get sick. And why was that rat bite poisonous?But, you know what? I kind of don't care because, as usual, Tom Hardy kicks @$$. He has several good moments in the film. And for those 2-3 moments, I'll probably watch the movie again because it's got Tom Hardy in it."
2,"Ok in the beginning and middle, confusing near end.","It drew me in at the beginning and the killing in the middle, but near the end was stupidly confusing. Normally whatever you see on the cover on the title is what you would be expecting to see. Instead of some ""cybernetic-type monster"", you got something else, I'm not going to ruin the surprise."
3,LD 50 Lethal Dose,"This movie was okay. Just okay. The plot was strange. Well, everything was. A waste of five bucks, but it's a great collectible if you like the Spice Girls. Watch if you like Mel B or you like really boring movies."
2,good in theory,"If you are looking for good recipes, then this book is not for you.But if you just want to know how to operate a bakery or just want to have an idea of how to bake and decorate basic recipe then this book is for you.The recipes are to be modified by you so that it can taste better. What is written in the book is just a general way of how to make it.The good part is the part about how to decorate a cake, how to place the filling and layer the cake traditionally.All in all i would say it is a good book if you are looking for theories and facts in general."
2,"To bake, or not to bake, that is the question...","Honestly, I found this textbook to be hard to follow, difficult to understand, and many of the recipes and formulas did not work. Also, there were not many photos, and the diagrams were confusing. This certainly is not for the home chef, and I hesitate to recommend this to professional students either."
5,poetry that is the doorway to humanity,"A poetry collection that is the doorway to humanity. Each and everyone of us is recognisable in between these pages, either through shared experiences, empathy or observation. Simply stunning work. I have loved, laughed and cried my way through the entire collection."
4,A crack-filler,"I am quite surprised by some of the excessibly negetive comments about this book. True, it is not as good as Card's best, but sub-standard for Orson Card is a great deel better than a lot of stuff out there. The first and last couple of books in the Homecomeing series are slightly better than the Call of Earth, this book is mostly good for filling in the cracks."
2,WAAAAAAY overpriced!,Any book in the Homecoming series would get a lukewarm review from the average Card fan. The storyline just isn't as riveting as Card's other works. I definitely wouldn't pay $200!!! for it! There must be a glitch in the system - are his books being printed on platinum now
4,"Ancient science fiction, gotta love it!","Card has produced a wonderful blend of past, present, andfuture. The people of Basilica exist in an ever consistantage that is ""old"", kinda medival. Yet their most violentemotions are kept at bay by an omni-present entity, theOversoul, a computer created millions of years ago. If youdon't find these concepts to be profound, then surely you'llfind them to be extremely fun. ( Rick Giacomo )"
3,A Powerful Overlord takes on a Powerful God,"Follow the tales of the evil General Moozah and his desire to take over the city of Women. He has marched his powerful army down from the north in an attempt to prepare to take over this enchanted city, and now he has come upon one of the most powerful families making plans to leave, and desiring them not to do so. Card uses a rather poor mechanism to allow them to escape, as this book really should have been combined with the next one, as neither advances the plot enough to fill an entire book. Both are drawn out and unecessary except for the simple adancement of plot and character development. However, the plot itself is obvious, and characters do not change in any way, but instead strengthen their existing interactions.For a single book, pass on this selection, but for the series, a must read."
3,...I thought Mormons had stricter moral standards than this.,"Pleasant enough writing, but I was deeply disturbed when two thirteen-year-olds wed and consummated their marriage, despite the fact that pretty much everyone in the book, the thirteen-year-olds included, felt they were far too young to marry. If the characters and cultural setting supported it or viewed it as normal, I would have less difficulty with it, but it was considered just as unhealthy in their culture as it is in ours. Clearly, the marriage was necessary for reasons of paralleling the religious story Card is retelling, but it was just as clear that the very being of the story and the characters opposed it.Three stars instead of four, because this was so painfully and clumsily executed."
5,Excellent Book,OSC has done it again. This book is truly one of the best book's I have ever read. If you liked Ender's Game then you should like this as well. In a way there are parallels between Ender and Nafai.
3,Morpil is pretty cool,The character of Morpil completely made this book interesting enough to finish. The General picked up the otherwise listing storyline and made it worth the read.
2,I was ready to get out of the car.,Listened to this book while travelling. I have read and listed to the Ender's Saga. In between finishing those early books and starting the Homecoming series I discovered OSC's LDS affiliation. While there was not much overt influence in the Ender's books parallels were endless in this volume. Rather than look at L. Ron Hubbard I would rather compare this cross-genre influence to C.S. Lewis or Madelyne L'Engle and their sybolic Christian references. Pleasant driving drivel.
1,Religiosly black and white - more than a century out of date,"Like in Memory of Earth the characters are sickeningly bland, and what's more important act outrageously stupid for people living in a dream world that has freedom of religion, instant data access, instant communication and seemingly a social system granting prosperity to everyone.The worst part are the religious ravings and horrible dream interpretations. If I hadn't read the Ender series I would have been on the verge of calling the author a religious nutbar but, alas ..."
1,Bored to tears,"Sorry, this book is not Mr Card's best. The characters are 2 dimensional and the plot is transparent. This is in stark contrast to his Endgame books which I thoroughly enjoy. Sorry Orson, you hit a skunk with a broom on this one."
5,great science fiction series,"Love all of Orson Scott Card books. He is a fantastic writer, pulling the reader into the story, immediately."
2,Ain't no Ender's Game,"This book ain't no Ender's Game, that is for sure. Is it really possible that the same guy wrote both books? Still, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy them. If you haven't read the Book of Mormon or aren't familiar with Mormonism at all I reco doing both before reading this series, you'll get more out of it and understand Card's writing better in general."
3,Second in the series.... A Little slow off the mark,"My congratulations to Card on a fine work. This whole series is very good. He has created an entire civilization and society with rules and laws. The amount of detail is incredible. However, if you didn't start at the first book, it takes a while to catch on. Also, if you don't read the books in order or even soon after each other, the relationships of all (and there are a lot) the characters to each other and to the plot becomes a little hazy.I would have given this one four stars except for the fact that the story is so complex and you can't just leave the series for an extended period and then start again and hope to understand what is going on.Card remains one of my favorite authors."
5,Loved this book,I love all of these Orson Scott Card Books all of his books are a great read. thank you very much!
2,The disappointment continues,"Well this series took a downturn. The first one wasn't great to start with. Yet, somehow, the series managed to become MORE one-dimensional, MORE predictable and MORE overtly religious in overtones. Except that even in the Bible people have more depth than in this book. Everyone in the second book seems to be either revoltingly self-centered and hard to get along with. Or id they aren't, they are so self-righteous that they make me want to start swearing and doing naughty things just to break up the monotony. This series is definitely a disappointment when side-by-side with Mr. Card's other books. I fell terrible for those who read this first, I'm sure they will never read any of his other stuff to see what can be GREAT."
2,Not a quality product,"- Very loose fitting- Sound quality is not very good- keeps slipping out of the ear, have to press hard to tuck it back in- All these problems faced just by using the headphones in sitting position. If used with actual sport activities, I am sure some more problems would pop up."
1,good maybe for elephants.....,"Following all the good reviews about these,I went and got a pair. It took me exactly 10 seconds to see what the problem is: these earphones are HUGE! How can anybody put that thing into his ear? And I an a pretty big guy. Of course, if they are not sitting properly in your ear the sound qulity is lousy. My only comfort is that I only lost 12$"
2,Silence of the left earphone.,I purchased this item on 12/12/09 and it never fit comfortably in the left ear but they were about twelve bucks so I did not send them back. Well on 7/9/2010 the left earphone stopped working. They were not mishandled or torn. There was no indication there was a problem with them. The sound was good and all of a sudden it stopped working. I am disappointed because Sony is usually a reliable product. I did not purchase a warranty and I guess I am literally paying the price for not doing so.
3,Gets the job done,"I guess non-slip is a loose term. True enough, h.ear headphones aren't likely to come off entirely, but they are likely to ""slip"" during most exercise routines. The bud design is clever, but (even for my big ears) the clip fits loosely enough to allow the buds to jar out of position. Because the sound flows away from the ear canal, this makes average speakers even less enjoyable. However, this is the first pair of headphones I've owned that weren't slaughtered by the rigors of a sweaty run. The design keeps sweat from drowning out the sound halfway through my three mile. The cord is also perfect length for sliding in my pack, or my Ipod Tuneband."
1,Not Orange!,The headphones that I received were an ugly red-orange. The main picture was quite deceiving.
4,Very Handy,"I.m using it with my portable mp3. It's very handy I can use in the gym, at the bus, in home, everywhere I recommend it"
1,These headphones blow!,"I received my item and was ecstatic as I opened the package. I had bought the headphones, hoping they would remain in place hooked on my ears. I had hoped they would stay in place better than the stock headphones I received with my iPod. Keep the stock headphones!! These Sony h.ear's kept falling off! They wont hug the inside of your ears at all!!!"
2,Mediocre Earphones,"I can't believe this is a Sony! The quality of sound is at the best mediocre, which deserve such a low price. By offering products like this, Sony is damaging its brand image. Sony shouldn't be competing in this price range at all. I am so disapointed."
3,They are OK,"They are OK headphones, I don't consider myself an expert but I wasn't blown away, I guess for the price it's a good buy. I just needed a good pair of headphones for running and for tha they are OK."
3,"They sound good, they seem sturdy, but","They don't fit that great and let in quite a bit of wind noise when I'm riding my bike above 12 miles/hour.Other than that, I think they're OK. When I'm lying in bed, it's necessary to push them in to equalize the sound, otherwise, one of them will insert further than the other."
4,Great for running,"Great headphones for running. Even a fairly hard tug at the wire won't pull them from your ears. They also work well for mountain biking, although the over the ear design is a little tricky when wearing a helmet and sunglasses - still the best option I've ever found though. Well worth the money.June 5, 2012 Update - these headphones are still going strong. I love them!"
1,not what I expected,"I ordered this because the way it was explained these head phones were comfortable and stayed on easily.. WRONG!!! they hurt my ears and they do NOT stay in place very well, I had to adjust them constantly. So maybe it is different for everyone due to their ears and how they fit, but they were not worth it to me and it would cost me more to return them, then to just donate them to Goodwill at least them I get a tax deduction off of them......"
2,Great--until they broke!,"I bought these about a year ago so they wouldn't fall out while I was running or working out. The sound quality wasn't amazing, but it was definitely sufficient--especially for the money. I run in a very windy area, and sometimes, when I was running into the wind, I would have to hold one of the earbuds in place or else it would get blown off. But this was only an issue when there was a very, very strong wind. In the gym or with a bit of wind they stayed on very well. I had no problems with how they looked, and they were very comfortable. However, a few weeks ago the sound in the left earphone stopped. I could only hear music coming into the right ear. Needless to say, this made them unusable. Then again, I got these for $12. In fact, for the price they served me pretty well, although I think you could do better."
3,Doesn't fit small ears!,"I don't have abnormally small ears or anything, but they ARE small because I'm a small girl. The headphones did not fit my ears well. They kept falling off and not staying in well. They are very nice though. My boyfriend has more normal sized ears and they fit perfectly on him. He loved them. I would just say not to get this product if you are a small person with kind of small ears. Otherwise, it is a great product."
4,Great for Sports and Work,"I bought these headphones about a month ago and they are by far my favorite to use for running. I had previosuly another pair of sony headphones (MDR-G57G) but I didn't like having the foam on my ears collecting sweat. The sound quality is a bit ""tinny"" compared to nicer over the ear headphones -- but with some tweaking of the eq settings in my mp3 player I get pretty decent sound. How the headphones fit in my ear did take some time to get used to, but they do stay on my ears during running. Overall, I'd highly recommend these headphones for sports use."
3,"Usuable, but not great...","My intent was to get earphones that don't fall out while I'm working out. These definitely don't. The wires seem ridiculously long though, and I had to tuck them into my armband to keep them from getting in the way. The sound is okay (not perfect, but respectable). I am a little disappointed with the sound, but only becuase Sony usually comes out with such high quality stuff. Lastly, this may be a unique complaint, because I have small ears, but the earphones definitely hurt after a little while."
5,These babies aren't falling out of my ears....,"I love these headphones. They have comparable sound to the headphones you get with an iPod, and they DEFINITELY NEVER FALL OUT OF YOUR EARS!! I have oddly shaped ears but dealt with the stock iPod headphones for a year until I just got these for Christmas. I love them already. I've slept with them in already too. I highly recommend these to anyone."
3,"Comfy fit & Stylish, but where's the bass?","Granted, I'm not into the thundering ""thump-thump"" of some bass lovers, but these headphones deliver next to nothing when it comes to balancing the treble / bass ratio of most of the types of music I listen to (punk / rock / metal). It's very tinny sounding. But, the price is right, so if don't mind a bass-less tone, go for it. Otherwise, shop around a bit more and if at all possible, try before you buy."
1,"not a good fit at all, decent sound","These would keep falling out of my ear, not a great design. The sound quality was ok though."
5,Headphones,Great product... works fine and very comfortable design to feet all.I am glad I have it now.
3,This hurts...,"If I wear this for long, my ears hurt.Although it fits well, but still I don't feel comfortable with these on.The sound quality is average."
2,Fair.,"They look neat, sound fair, and tangle quite easily. Despite their appearance, they really are not well designed for active people. While running, sweat somehow manages to run down the plastic clips and ""flood"" the ear buds. It did not long before they started to sound weak, and lose bass response. Finally my right side blew, even though my MP3 player has a pretty mild sound output.I got a few months of use out of them, and am debating getting a new pair. I don't like the idea of disposable hardware; I expected much better from Sony."
5,Perfect they just died after about 3 years........,"These are perfect for running, biking or any kind of sport you do, well maybe not any sport. The sound quality isn't the best, but good enough for me. They're good enough to block out a bus full of noisey kids. I also like this because they don't get in the way of any sunglasses you might have placed on your head. My only problem with them headphones is that they died after about 3 years. They're my favorite kind when it comes to earbud headphones. They're cheap and of great quality (they just die after 3 years of abuse). A definate buy!"
4,good for the money,"i read the other reviews and decided to take the plunge anyway even though i have small ears. the head phones stay in place pretty well when i've used them on the treadmill and elliptical machines. in terms of sound, i'm not a major afficionado, but i don't think the sound quality would be considered amazing. the headphones do the job and block out overhead gym music fairly well. i hope they last because overall i'm very satisfied especially compared to my previous ear buds."
3,Designed for a selected few however very inexpensive.,"I love sony, however these headphones are barely above par. I wear glasses so they don't fit correctly and consequently don't feel comfortable at first. I'm use to them now but they are very sleek and I barely notice them now. I like them because they're not in my hair. I somewhat like the tangle free design because I occasionally find knots in them after taking them out of my bag.The sound quality is fairly good. However along with all the rest of the reviews, the bass is not very strong. I am also not really into pumping the bass up, but I like a little in my electronica/dance music. It is adequate but I'd like more. Considering that they have only 13.5 mm drivers, it's to be expected. I would advise at least 30mm drivers for you bass people."
2,one ear bud died after less than one year!,"My original review is below. One of the ear buds has died. Disappointing.----I just received these, so this is not a long-term owner review, but I can say that I like the fit and quality of these headphones. The ear buds that you just push into your ear always fall out of my ears, so the vertical clip-in design is a must for me; these feel secure. The sound quality is fine.The only con for me thus far is: I bought these expecting a bright orange color. The color is more of a red-orange. This isn't a huge deal, but not what I was hoping for."
1,ouch,"These headphones looked perfect and very cute. But when I got them, first I couldn't get them to actually hook around my ears (smaller ears I guess). Without the hooks working they could partially sit as earbuds - but I wouldn't have been able to wear them very long because the plastic is painful in my ears. Last thing is the sound quality is awful. No bass and lots of static noise if the volume is over half way up. I guess they were cheap...in every way, more hassle to return than it's worth."
3,They're okay,"I got these after my previous ear buds cracked. I was excited because the pink is a really cute color, but the headphones do not fit my ears at all. I wouldn't say I have particularly small ears, but I found that my older headphones fit a lot more snugly and stay in while I run. So, these are now my backup headphones, and I've superglued my old ear buds back together!"
1,Wish I Didn't Buy These,"I wish that I would have spent just a little more money on something better, that I could actually use! I don't see how anyone can wear these. I wouldn't consider my ears small by any means, but there's no physical way that these headphones will stay on me. I was really disappointed. =/I would say that you get what you pay for, but I've had cheap 99 cent ear buds work better than these do."
2,Pink Sony ear buds,These are good for running and have a pretty good sound quality. The only thing negative is that the pink ones are twice the price as the white ones?
3,Not that great,"On the positive, the phones are easy to put on, the sound quality is good. On the negative, they do not sit in the ears as perfectly - they sit a bit loosely because they do not have rubber-like things to hold them in place. I got the orange ones thinking they would look great. But the color isn't that bright - it's more dark-pinkish/light reddish; black ones probably would have been better. In conclusion, would recommend them given the price, but not have too high expectations."
3,OK headphones,For the price these headphones are satisfactory. The sound is good and they are comfortable. The only issue is that they do not stay in place very well during running activities. They stay in fine for less jarring exercise - but not great for running.
4,Pretty good deal,"First: these headphones aren't orange, they're pink. The speakers on these phones look forward, they're not turned into your ear, so they don't have the volume they might if they faced the ear canal(if you press on them they are loud). This actually may be a good thing, since they are easier on the ear than some other kinds. They are econonomical in the power they consume; they'll run all day on one battery. The sound is good, not great - these are low-cost headphones, so let's not expect audiophile quality. That said, they are quite acceptable. THEY STAY ON YOUR EAR. For me, they are just fine."
2,Not the right fit,These headphones just did not fit my ears at all. They keep falling off when I'm just walking much less taking them for a run.
5,If you're looking for an alternative to uncomfortable earbuds...,"...these are great! I recently purchased an iPod and the earbuds that came with it were so uncomfortable I knew I had to find something better. I wanted something that would be small yet comfortable and would stay in place when walking, running, etc. These headphones are perfect! They fit my ear like a glove, and the smaller ""earbud"" piece slips right in and rests comfortably just inside your ear. They're very comfortable and don't budge even when yanking on the cord. They don't have the world's best sound quality, but they fit the bill for the kind of music I listen to. If you like your music loud and with a lot of heavy bass, these may not be for you - but compared to the stock iPod earbuds these have very comparable sound. I recommend these to anybody who is looking for a good alternative to the not-so-comfortable earbuds."
2,Dissappointing Sound,"Yeah they fit good and are durable but their sound quality is awful. There is no mid at all, and the headphones are lacking in any sort of warmth. It sucks, I'd avoid these."
2,"Average, at best","These actually fit my ears pretty good. I prefer the look of the Sony MDR-J11's which look like they might be less bulky, but they are harder to find than these.What really disappointed me was the sound quality. I know these are cheap headphones, but I thought a company like Sony would do much better.My Iriver mp3 player came with Sennheiser MX100 earbuds (cheaper in price than the Sony's), but I can't stand earbuds (they won't stay in), so I bought these to replace them. The sound quality on the Sennheisers is noticeably much better.Don't waste your money on these Sony's, find something else."
1,Not worth it,"These headphones sound great for the price, but as a workout headphone they are a complete fail. They don't stay in your ears they fall out all the time. Plus the color is more pinky than orange. Price wise they are right on the button. But, it is still a complete waste of money."
2,Won't stay in my ears,"Perhaps my ears are small on the inside or something, but these headphones WILL NOT stay in them! I'm constantly pressing on them to stay in, but no good. I've had them for about 3 days now, and will be looking for different ones."
4,"Great sound, stays on","These earphones are great sound quality for the price and where I normally use them, the gym. They also STAY ON, which is an amazing thing to say about earphones these days. If you're looking for headphones for an active lifestyle, these are them!"
3,Works OK thanks to the previous reviewer,Thankfully we were able to program it by using the power button as Mr Cline suggested. We agree it is nonsense to have to enter*1 after the pin# for a one door situation.
1,Poor quality,My first one died in 2 year. I bought the same one to replace it but the second one died in 6 months. I am looking for a different universal one that will work with this garage door opener.
1,DOES NOT WORK (with Allister garage door),"I have programmed 2 different hand-held remotes and another brand of wireless keypad remote to work with my Allister garage doors. I cannot for the life of me get this thing to work. First of all, Allister has only 2 dip switch settings, not three as the instructions indicate, so I have to guess at which of the three codes into which one translates dip switch settings my 2-setting dip switches are translated. Call tech support? well the number listed in the instructions: 610 873 6900 is DISCONNECTED. hmmmm. not worth any furhter effort, as I said, I've been successful with others, I didn't want to stay with my existing remote cause, after 4+ years it stopped working below 40 degrees (yes, I changed its batteries). seems like a 5-star product in comparison"
1,NOT THE SAME AS THE 7TH EDITION,"If you were looking to save money by buying the older edition of this book, sadly, it won't work.Every semester when I am told by my professors to buy the new book...I do. But I also buy the last edition (usually for pennies on the dollar compared to the new edition) and usually find that there is no need for the newer, more expensive version. (I then return the new version to the book store for a refund and use the savings to buy supplements.) That is not true with this book.Difference between 6th and 7th Edition:Not only are there a lot of new cases in the new one and dropped cases from the old one, but the chapters are organized differently. All you have to do is look at the table of contents for both books and you will see that the old version won't work if you professor is having you read specific page numbers.I think this is the first time ever, but I highly recommend buying the newer edition of this book."
4,great book!,this book is very good because it help me a lot in my studies. and also give me knowledge that i really want.
5,Good spy story and romance; well paced!,"I really enjoyed this story. I think it is her first Regency and for me it had all I look for. Romance, witty dialogue, very likeable characters and, as a bonus, a good spy story that kept me guessing. There were no slow points in the entire book. My only quibble was when a secondary character made a very stupid move that seemed almost too stupid to be believed. Luckily the key word here is ""almost"" so I was able to accept it without ruining my enjoyment of the story too much. This is more a 4.5 star for me than a 5 because it didn't quite make my ""classic Regency"" list. But I finished the book with a smile on my face, sorry it ended but satisfied with the ending!"
1,give this book a miss,The book starts off with a promising plot then veers off into contrived and unbelieveable situations. The author tries to portray the heroine as spunky but she comes off as thoroughly childish. The only good thing is that this is a book you can easily put down.
2,"Surprisingly loud for a ""lullaby soother""","I am happy for the parents whose children ""drift"" off to sleep with this toy in their crib. My biggest complaint is the lack of volume control, which I can't understand why anything that has to do with bedtime would lack. Also, Pooh's intermittent ""I'm so sleepy"" is disruptive at the fixed volume. I love the lights, I love the music, I love the nature sounds, but without volume control, they're all pointless. Maybe two rooms away it's a lullaby soother."
5,Great soother!,"My baby is fussy! However, if I put this Pooh next to him in bed or on his lap when he is in his swing, he goes right to sleep! It is a beautiful toy and the music is so cute. Pooh says NIGHT NIGHT and birds chirp... and I do not think it is too loud like others said."
4,baby like the toy,My little guy (14 months)turns on the lights and music throughout the night. I thought the music was a little too loud but it seems to please him which is the most important.
4,Sweet Toy - a little loud...,"I've been reading the reviews of this item and agree that the volume is loud. A quick fix is to take the music box out of the pillow, get a piece of scotch tape and put it over a couple of the sound vents, then put it back into the case. It makes it much quieter and can be removed easily....hope this helps...All in all, it's a really cute toy. Our daughter likes the nature sounds best."
3,Great but has its problems,"I love how this soother can let you program for up to 25 minutes. In that respect it is better than the crib aquarium which plays just under 10 minutes. The problem that I have is that it has 3 volume settings: 1)no sound but lights up 2) loud with lights and 3)Really loud with lights. It would be perfect if it had a better volume control and if Pooh's voice wasn't so loud as well. His voice is even louder than the sound effects and music it seems. We are going to try and devise a way to muffle the sound a bit- shouldn't be too hard. And like someone said in a previous review, if Pooh has been off for awhile, the remote doesn't work anymore. I can't believe that pre-manufacturing testers didn't realize how loud the volume was!"
3,nice but a little too loud,"The bear is cute and I love that it lights up but..it is just too loud. if my daughter hit it during the night it wakes us all up and her room is down the hall. i now let her go to sleep with it but once she is fast asleep, i go and take it out of her bed."
5,Love this!,"We bought this for our daughter when she was only 2 weeks old. She slept a lot better with it. Now she is almost 5 months and loves to snuggle up to him before drifting off to sleep. It has soft songs, and it lights up her crib with red, green, blue, etc. its very soothing. It's a must for a crib! PLEASE keep in mind that remote RARELY works. We stopped using it and the company refused to fix it for us."
4,Great Soother but way too Loud,We bought this for our daughter who was a premie to help her sleep. She loves it and does fall asleep but boy is it loud because it surely keeps us up. I have even been startled by the toy when my husband turns it on for our daughter and I am sleeping..... I wish they thought about volume control
3,Disappointing,"I bought this toy for my 5 month old infant. The selling point for me was the remote control. I was so excited when it got here only to find out that the remote control doesn't do what I needed it to do. I needed to be able to turn the Pooh on without my daughter seeing me. I pushed the button on the remote every angle possible and it wouldn't work. My husband and I experimented with it the next day and found out that if you turn the toy on then the remote will do everything it's suppose to, turn it off, turn it to different settings everything. But when Pooh goes off and is left for a period of time the remote will no longer operate him. It's also VERY loud. It will play music and nature sounds which are great, even though they are loud, but then Pooh will say ""night night"" or some other words and the loudness of it will wake her back up again. I had a Ocean Wonders Aquarium for my first child and will be buying another one to replace this disappointing toy."
4,Useful for back road explorers,"This large format atlas is roughly equivalent to the Delorme New Mexico atlas, but isn't nearly as pretty. There are no contour lines or land-use boundaries, just B+W road maps. The base data is different, however, so it could be a useful supplement to Delorme. This one comes from official State of New Mexico maps, so it contains information on the status of dirt roads that Delorme doesn't have (since Delorme comes from USGS sources). If you do a lot of dirt road exploring, this atlas could be very helpful. Outside of big towns, this atlas even shows individual houses and windmills."
4,Good Purchase,"This being my first purchase through Amazon I was a little hesitate at first. I've been looking to purchase a dehumidifer for my damp closet and in doing research, found that Eva-dry are the best out there for the price point and size. This dehumidifer by Eva-dry does what it says, removes moist damp air in the smallest of spaces, even worked on my buddy's safe. The only downsize is that you do need to check it from time to time to see when the pink colored beads turn blue, perhaps a alarm or something better than visible window.Eva-dry Renewable EDV-300/E-333 Wireless Mini Dehumidifer"
4,Great use for paper collectibles,"Great use for small and quiet areas. I collect comic books, and this is a great size and use for storage in a closet."
4,thanks,"thanks I need this product because my broker and I research in internet, now I work so so thanks thanks"
4,Safe is dry and guns are happy.,"Easy to use, safe is dry as are guns.Easy to recharge. I bought two, but since it only takes a few hours to recharge I will give the other unit as a gift."
2,Looks impressive but works from an outlet!,"I just received this item. I ordered two thinking I could place it in the closets. However, there are two things they do not tell you.Yes, it does not work on batteries but is somewhat dependent on electricity. If you do not have an outlet in the room you want to put it you are out of luck. I was planning to put it in my closet but won't work unless I put an extension cord which I do not see it practical.The other thing they do not tell you is that you cannot use it for more than 18 hours. Well, what happens after this? Does it go on fire? I thought it could be left unattended until the colors changed but not with a limitation. So beware and consider this.I cannot grade it because I have yet to tested. Most likely I will return the second one if I cannot use it just any place as it requires an outlet."
3,"Needs constant ""drying"", easily falls and comes apart","I agree with the customer who complains about the balls becoming pink very fast. I bought four of these to put into the closet of each bedroom and I have to plug them at least once every two-three weeks, which is kind of a hassle. Also, they easily come off the hook and, should they hit the ground, open and spill the balls all over the place; quite messy. I am looking for a better solution."
5,Fantastic product,"This does a great job at keeping everything dry in my safe. I was having problems with mold, and a few days with this deice sucked the moisture out. I do have to remember to check it periodically and plug it in."
3,70 percent is 20 percent to high,This e-333 will not lower my Grafunder air tight safe lower than 70 percent. I placed it in the safe 2 weeks ago and 70 percent prevails. I need 45 to 55 for metal contents. I have ordered the 500 and will add it to the safe along with the 333 and report results. I hate to give up on these since they are so simple to use but 55 percent is minimum.Update: Added e-500 and it only lowered inside humidity 1 percent after 7 days to 69 percent. I will look elsewhere to obtain 55Percent.
5,Great little product,Great solution for humidity problems here in FL.Keeps mildew at bay in my closet. Also eliminates noxious musty odors.
4,Cheaper than Damp Rid!,I think these do a fairly good job in removing dampness from my closet. Important thing to remember is to renew them regularly by plugging into the wall.Damp Rid is my favorite but I have been going through a lot of them.
5,Always good,I have ordered from this company several times and the products have always been received as expected in a timely manner.
2,Am I doing this right?,"I am not sure mine is working, I have had it in a damp area for over a week now and the crystals have not changed color at all. I was so excited about this thing, what a bummer..."
5,Amazingly Dry in one day,"Wow, am I impressed. This item delivers. I had a small safe that was getting musty and all the documents felt soft and damp. I charged up the Eva-dry, stuck it in and BAM! (Emeril Style) The next day everything was dry and crisp. I recharged the unit over night and stuck it back in the safe. It couldn't be easier!And those of you who read the other reviews and see people write things about not being able to tell if the crystals are blue or pink, IGNORE THEM. The people that wrote those are obviously dumb or blind. This product couldn't be easier to use. If all the crystals aren't the same color, then either plug it back into the wall, or keep letting it do it's thing. Enough said."
1,Doesn't Work,Bought it to help reduce humidity in closet that has a mold issues so we know there is moisture in the space. What doesn't happen is the crystals don't change color at all. Best thing about the product is its price. Worst thing about the product is it doesn't work.
1,utterly inefficient. doesnt recharge properly,I bought two of these. Dont help at all and dont recharge so they can be used again.They are heavy and keep falling out of the switchplate which means you need to go buy a sizer to fit in tightly. I did that but it still doesnt charge properly.Such a pity because its a terrific idea and would be very useful.
5,DEHUMIDIFY ANYTHING,What a great product for Floridians. Reasonably priced. Take it out of the box and set it where you need it.
2,received different product,In looking at the pictures I realized I didn't receive the mini dehumidifier I got another EDV 300 which I had ordered on the same day. I thought it seemed weird but since one came from Ace Hardware and the others came from Amazon I thought maybe I'd read the descriptions wrong and had actually ordered the same thing even though I'd paid more. I learned to order from Amazon and not Ace Hardware.
2,I have mixed emotions,"I bought it i put 2 in my closets but after the 3rd day they are in the pale rose. Ok nothing smells, But i'm confused. the same happens with a little cabinet maybe of 20cms by 20cms....i put to charge and they where dark blue and now i checked and they are pink....so i don't know if they are working or not i gues i will have to try them until i decide if they are worth the money. that is the only thing i can say about them and i have 4, 2 in my room's closet and one in 2 little cabinets. I can not understand why they changed in 3 days from dark blue and more than 15 hours of charging to pink....On the other hand i can not say they are bad , at least i'm not smelling anything , but then how i could get the indication that they are full?"
1,Mine didn't work,"Did any of the other reviewers use a hygrometer? I do, and mine showed no noticeable improvement of humidity level over three days. I'm returning it."
5,Awesome,"I bought this for condensation in my kegerator. I works great and It takes no electricity to run so it's cost effective and I just set it, and forget it. As joe Biden would say ""literally"". I hope we vote obama out"
1,Too large,"Unfortunately, I purchased two of these and can't use them because they are too large to fit into a camera bag. They would work in a closet nicely I think."
1,Agreed! Not for bathrooms!,"I wish I had seen the other reviewer's comments about this. I purchased this for the same reason (ad said it worked well in small room), but it is insufficient to remove the moisture from a bathroom. It may do well, as suggested, in a closet that is not a source of moisture but suffers from some humidity, but despite leaving it plugged in around the clock in my bathroom, we are still having problems with moisture."
5,works well,"Using this in an approx. 20""x20""x12"" gun cabinet with an Accurite Humidity Meter. The humidity/temperature pretty much matches local weather report, so it appears the meter works too. I sealed the cabinet with tape and weather stripping. Humidity outside generally ranges from 60-78% but as low as 38% in the cabinet. I open the cabinet a couple times a week, after about 5 weeks the humidity in the cabinet gradually rose to about 50%. Recharged the Eva-dry for about 10 hours and the humidity in the cabinet has dropped back down to 38%. The crystals change color as advertised. I'm pleased with the purchase and would buy it again."
3,not too effective,At first the crystals took long to change color but after the first time it seems to change accordingly. But the main problem was that I did not see a significant difference in the level of humidity in my room. I'm guessing it works judging by the color change but wouldn't buy another one.
5,Good Investment,This unit works well and the beads that change color are an easy reminder of when to recharge it. I've used it for over 4 years and am very happy with it.
4,dehumidifier,Working great so far. Hope to see low humidity when the really cold weather hits and the steam builds up in the bathroom. Had to plug in once so far release the build-up of moisture in the machine. It's so easy to use!
4,satisfied,Good product. keeps my guns dry. when the beeds change color just plug it in for a few hours and start again. The only hold back is that is has nothing to hang it or clip it on something.
3,Needs recharging often,I have been using this in a small container for the past month or so. It seems to be doing a pretty good job of keeping things from mildewing. My experience is that it needs to be charged about every 10 days to two weeks. I'd rather not have to keep that close of a watch on it. This is a very small area to keep dehumidified and the claim was that it would hold a charge from 3-8 weeks depending on the humidity level.
5,Ziggy's New Air..,We have a beautiful and loving cat Ziggy who has breathing problems;this dehumidifer has been so good for him plus all you do is plug it inand it has an almost invisible presence in the room...it has helpedZiggy so much...we are very pleased with this product.
3,Works to a point,"I purchased two of these for my cabinet which is 2' X 3' x 2', and they work fine for about 24 hours, then I have to recharge it. I found having 2 allows me to recharge one while one stays in the cabinet. It is a bit of a pain to change daily, but for the price it works. Unless you live in a dry area, I would buy 2 so you can cycle them back and forth and have constant dehumidifying rather then 1 and letting the area get damp while it recharges."
4,I love this thing,"I've been discovering moldy clothes in my closet for years and having to get rid of some and dryclean some; they all still smell somewhat.Then I got this product for my closet and it's been amazing. No moldy clothes yet, and I can feel the difference in the closet. This puppy works overtime!Plusses: Renewable. Does not require the same resources as Damp-Rid. Works better than Damp-Rid. Easy to use. Inexpensive.Minus: Needs recharging too often--for me, about every 2-2 1/2 weeks."
5,Solved Humidity and Dampness Problem Within Hours.,I have a small safe for important documents and other valuables. Have been using gel packets to absorb moisture but they were not that effective. Safe had a very musky smell when opened and documents felt damp. Decided to try Eva-dry EDV 300/E Wireless Mini Dehumidifier because of good reviews on Amazon. It arrived and i placed in safe and checked 12 hours later and document were totally dry. This Item Works Great!! Would highly recommend!!!
5,Eva-dry renewable EDV-300 review,"This dehumidifer was installed with a EDV-500 in my gun safe. This is an overkill but I wanted them to get any moisture out of the safe. It has been 30 days and the color has started to change, all appears to be working fine. The safe is in my garage which has a potential for more moisture than the house. I will know more in a year, but as of now all is fine."
4,Easy dry,Works like a champ for small shower area or closet. Second purchase of this item this time for closet. After crystals turn pink just plug it into wall socket to dry them out and they turn back to blue. Lasts for weeks.
4,i think it works,"So I got the EDV-330 and a EDV-E-500 for my walk in closet and the basement. They both seem to take down the musty smell. I haven't plugged them in yet, but it does seem to be a little difficult to tell if the color has changed. The color window is barely pink. I'll wait a bit to watch it and if the color doesn't change, I'll just plug it in. Not a huge issue as the humidity does seem better, but not as easy to use as I'd hoped."
3,Small and Compact,"Simple to use, just unwrap and place in safe. It hangs or can be placed on a shelf. We'll see how it works in removing the moisture from inside the safe."
5,WORKS GREAT!!!,"I keep my precious 2ND Amendment rights in a gun cabinet, and to keep them from rusting, I use the Eva-Dry, and keep them lightly oiled. So far, I have had NO problems with any moisture problems. Even with humidity at 80%+, the Eva-Dry seems to keep drawing the moisture out of the cabinet. Keep your guns safe, and buy this product. It will help keep your heirlooms safe for years to come."
5,Great Dehumidifer I Love It,"This thing is Great for my gun safe I only have to check it about every other month or so and honestly I Love it, Amazon has really good products at very low prices and I would like to start promoting this product for Amazon on my site.[...]"
5,I have no idea about how it works.,I just got it today and really have no idea about how it works.Do i need to plug it about 12 hours and then just put it somewhere I want it works for?Is there any signal to show that it works?
2,purchased for a gun safe,Put this device inside a small gun safe along with a digital humidity meter.It has been in there for almost a month and the humidity inside the safe is just slightly lower than outside. The safe has a foam gasket around the door so I guess it is fairly air tight. Maybe I need to give it more time.
2,Beads everywhere,"I only had it for about a week and it showed no sign of doing anything when I accidently knocked it off the counter and beads went everywhere. Trust me, you are not going to get the beads back in the box."
2,Did not live up to title,"From the title, I thought this would be a book of humorous quotes. It had mostly quotes about humor, most of which may have been thought-provoking, but not that funny. Certainly nothing that would cheer me up when I am feeling down. I gave the book away and regretted buying it."
4,Great TV for the price!!!,"I was amazed at how good the picture looks on this TV as cheap as it is. Of course, I did take the liberty of tweaking the picture settings (all TV's come from the factory with Contrast jacked up way too high). After lowering the contrast, and tweaking the brightness and color level, this thing has an amazing picture for DVD (using S-video cable).I would have given this TV five stars, but unfortunately there are no on screen channel labels, and there is no fine adjustment for bass and treble, there is only a ""boost"" setting for each.All in all, I love this thing, glad I got it, and I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg."
1,Philips TV Doesn't Work,"Purchased through another retailer, the television arrived non-operational. TVs should be tested before shipped."
4,useful book,"From a parent perspective, this book is very readable, and provided helpful information, especially one very clear chart that helped me to determine whether to be concerned about my duaghter's behaviors, and whether I needed to consult with a professional."
5,Great All PurposeSwimSuit,I swim several times a week and I've found these suits to be excellent. The price is right and they hold up to daily use in chlorine well. The fit is good and suit arrived quicker then expected. What more could you want?
1,over a month for shipping,I cancelled this item because I ordered it on Jan. 18 and would not have received it until on or after Feb. 18--which I didn't realize until almost 2 weeks of waiting. I am not willing to wait that long for something that should take no more than 2 weeks to process. It's like it was coming from the Himalayas on the back of some beast!
2,Not very durable,"My dogs need really durable toys because they are very curious what is inside of the each new toy I buy for them. This one lasted no more than 15 minutes. If you need a good and durable dogy toy, this one is not for you."
1,Not for a 'chewer',I got this for my sister's terrier and within five minutes she had chewed the beak off. A choke hazard for sure. Please monitor your dog closely if you get this product.
4,It's okay.,"I personally didnt enjoy it very much, but it is mandatory material for school. It is a bit interesting however. I received the book in a short amount of time, and given the price I paid, the book is in great condition.Thank you"
1,this is no different from the sims,This game isn't any better than the sims i own both games and the only thing thats differnt from the sims and the sims busten out is the story line and that you watch you drive your vehicle i men how gay is that?I mean i don't know why they called this game sims bustin out i mean i dont even know why they wasted there time makeing this one.I sugest if you want to start with sims wait and get the sims 2.
1,0 stars to be honest,I got it and it didn't work ! so I pressed return they took 3 days to approve it then they make me pay to return it!!!! its all bad and its didn't come in a case or a cd holder I got the case u get for bootleg movies ! the game was hella scratch never again
5,The Sims Bustin' Out,"I bought this game at a KB Toys store a couple years ago. Loved the game. Several different places you can travel and move to. Love how you have more options in the buy/build mode and you get cars! :) Several more goals compared to the first Sims Get A Life game. This game can be quite addicting! Even after you play all the way through this game, you'd still want to start all over again. It's that fun and interesting to play!"
4,Bustin Out?,Well I bought this game and I was so excited! Then I discovered that you can only leave the house in bust out mode. Also when you bust out you can`t go downtown you can just go to friend`s houses. (from what I know so far if there is a way I haven`t figured it out yet.) Another thing that I didn`t like was that there are not very many house lots as in the computer versions.But I loved the graphics and all the unlockables. I also loved all the different carreer choices and styles. I also thought that the bust out mode was very cool with all the houses and different goals. I guess I just expected more from my favorite brand of games. But if I was you I would rent it before buying it to see what you think. I really hope the next game for PS2(which comes out in November.)will be alot better.
4,"Good Game , If you never played the original","The Sims Bustin Out is almost the same game as the original. There are hardly any new features that stand out and i was very disapointed. Although, if you have never played the original, This is a great game to check out."
3,How depressing!,"your not aloud to have kids? thats the whole aspect i loved about the sims 2 cpu version! was having a kid teaching them to walk and talk, and then watching them grow up! What is this bs!"
4,I could play this game for hours,"This game, is so classic. I play this for hours. It's so addictive, and it's the only sims game I'll by for the PS."
4,It almost kicks ass,"I give it a 4 out of 5 because there's a good part and a bad part: The good part: You create a sim (and I like the fact that you, in Free Play, can get married), the bad part: there's not much of a plot."
4,really fun game,The Sims Bustin Out is a really fun game. Way better than the first. I think the graphics are really good too. The boring thing is that you have to live with your mom in the beginning again. But the levels are way mor fun than the first.
3,You need patience to play,"I bought this thinking it was like the original computer version.See I haven't played the the Sims on PS2, seeing as both were getting pretty good reviews, i bought Bustin' Out. It was a bad choice, a very bad choice. One goal was to pick up about 13-14 piles of trash, it sounds okay until you see how slow it gets done. The way your Sim walks is really annoying. If your into doing goals, goals, and more goals than get this game."
2,The Sims Bustin' Out - A major disappointment,"Before you read the glowing reviews about new objects, social interactions and the ability to visit other locations, ask yourself what you expect from a Sims game. If you prefer mission based gameplay and nothing else, this is the game for you. If you prefer the open ended free play of the original console Sims and the PC games, save your money. In the Bustin' Out version of free play you are only given three open houses instead of the six in the original. You can forget about all the exciting places like Club Rubb and Pixel Acres you unlock in the mission based mode because you can't visit or call any of the Sims you met there. You're basically stuck in your free play house with only your neighbors from the other two free houses to invite over. This total lack of freedom ruined the replay value of this game for me despite the new items and locations. I only recommend this disaster to die hard Sims fans who must own every game and expansion."
3,Ehh...it's okay.,"After playing the original sims for pc for around 2 years, I bought this game expecting hours of fun gameplay like I had from the original pc version. I was wrong. The game is alright, but it's incredible hard to keep all of your motives up whilst managing a job and completing tasks. In free play mode it is very difficult to keep their motives green because you hardly have enought money to buy the necessities. Overall the game was okay, but didn't keep me entertained for long. But everyone has their own opinion on it, right? I recenlty sold the game back to the game store.. :P"
2,Whoop de do where will it end?,yyay ! another sims gameboring... takes up a TON of memory card and it's the same as the first one
1,What is the point of this game?,"Bad graphics, bad sound, not in anyway fun. To hard. This game is stressful, just like real life and I don't want to sit down and waste my time at this. You can't keep yourself happy and do all the other things in the short amount of time you get. In the games time, it takes him an hour and a half to eat, half hour to go to the bathroom, he needs to sleep for at least nine hours and need to be happy, clean, likes the house, is relaxed, and is social staduis is good. In the later levels you have to on top of that help run a gym and help people and stuff"
3,a hard game,the sims it sucks cause you cant find the fern for the goth and why do you need frieds to get premoed
2,Memory cards!,"I have 3 kids who all would like to play this game, but they can't without erasing the other's progress. Whenever you create another person to play with, it asks you if you would like to save, you click yes, and it asks you if you would like to overwrite the current player. Its stupid, and memory cards turned out costing much more than the game itself, so if you have more than 1 person wanting to play this game, you have three options. Buy massive amounts of memory cards; don't end up buying the game in the first place; or listening to arguing over who erased who's Sims."
4,I like Sims,The Sims Bustin' Out is an awesome and fun game to play. It is also easier than the computer games>
5,Loved the game! Best SIMS of all time so far!,"I loved everything about this game. I have completed every goal andplayed through every scenerio and spent countless hours playing andhaving a blast. The only reason for rating it a 9 instead of a 10 isbecause they discontinued online play. :( I wanted to try that sobadly and the game box still says it's available but then when you tryto connect it won't so we searched online and found out it wasdiscontinued years ago. Major Bummer. But other than that, it's myfavorite edition of SIMS of all time! Instead of just trying to keepthem alive and happy which gets old, fast, I LOVED having actual goalsto work towards in order to unlock the next level. Kept the game interesting!! :)Best part of all was that it is multiplayer so my daughter and I (or husband or son)can play together!! Lots of fun and hours, days, months of entertainment!!"
3,Aren't there any similar books for boys ???,"I liked this book, but the only problem is... I'm a boy ! Unfortunately the title might also be: Why It Sucks to Be a Boy : 50 Eye-Opening Things You Can Tell Your Son to Make Him Fell Bad About Being Male"
5,Only the best for me,I loved this manga. It is for all ages. So far their are only girls in the book. But I no later on their will be boys. This book is about this girl named Digiko (I think someting like that) and she is a princess from a planet called Di Gi Charat and she has this bell on her that holds her Space Ship........I think if I remember correctly. And her to freinds Rabbit N Rose. And this other one her name is like Pochico........ok thats totally spedlled wrong....but its something like that. And so in this book they just get a job in this place called Gamers. And then end up being waiters.......I think. And Digiko ends up going to school and the kids stare at her and laugh at her and pull her tail and ears. And her and Rabbit N Rose are always in compition with each other.
2,The Innacurate Translations Ruin the Humor.,"DiGi Charat is great. If you want a good read, get the DiGi Charat Theater mangas translated by Broccoli USA. The guy who translated this 4 volume series was obviously not a fan of the anime series, or he wouldn't have tainted it by translating PYO/NYO/NYU into SQUEEK/MEOW/MYEW, & on top of that, the characters don't end almost every sentance with pyo/nyo/nyu/gema like they're supposed to. If they redo the translations, I'll give it a 4 or 5."
2,"Absolutely adorable, but not all that interesting...","I kind of feel like the bad person writing this-especially after all of the reviews this book got were 5 stars.But to tell you the truth, I didn't enjoy this book a single bit. I was going to give it 1 star, but the second star is for its cuteness.When I first bought this, I had high expectations for the series after hearing about it for several years.As soon as I finished reading it, I felt as though I had wasted a good $12.95.If you like cute characters who star in short stories with no plot, practically about nothing, then this is for you.But if you're looking for a good story that has a terrific plot, then I suggest getting another manga. This isn't for you.This is definitely a purchase I truly regret."
4,Must have for Gusgus fans,"This is a wonderful collection of tunes spun by Gusgus at a small club in Iceland. Every track is very lush, funky and very gusgus-esque (only one real gusgus song on here). Def a must have for every gusgus fan out there, only complaint I have about this cd is that the recording quality is not all that great, yeah its kinda cool that you can hear all the folks in the bar but it does have a bootleg quality which detracts from the great tunes that are on here. But, don't let that hold you back from getting this cd, its def worth having! Oh, and by the way, be kind to animals, don't eat them! Peace!"
2,disappointed,"Items did not arrive in good shape and some due to not made ready to ship very well. Just stuck in a manilla envelope, no bubble wrap or anything to protect the books!!!! Probably will not deal with this seller again."
2,Way Too hard!!!!!,"I agree with all who said that the game is WAY TOO HARD! I hold a private pilot license and have also flown radio control planes for over 25 yrs so I know what I am saying when I say that the flight charateristics AND the campaign goals are rediculously difficult even in the ""rookie"" mode. The game may have some possitive value for those who know where and how to get cheats or who enjoy doing the same level 25-30 times and still not advancing but I am not one of those. I had a successfull career as a watchmaker and jeweler so patience and precision are not problems for me but enough is enough. Also there is little or no instruction on how to accomplish any of the goals in each scenario. I was initially pleased with finding a WWII flying game but now very disapointed and have quit playing it since the idea is to have fun not to get so completely frustrated that you want to throw the controller through a window."
3,"Not bad, not great.","Its a pretty good game if the subject matter is something your into. But its pretty basic, nothing special just a standard arcade-ish kind of flying game."
2,Hard to play,This game is difficult in controlling the airplanes. Unless you are a very good gamer you will be discouraged.
1,Not Fun,"This game is not fun, it is tedious. Everytime you fail at a mission you have to go back to the beginning. Listening to the instructor nag you that you need to get back to your flight plan when you are directly over the enemy target is annoying to say the least. I could also do without the constant insults. I agree with a previous reviewer; targeting is extremely hard and frustrating. Note to Programers: GAMES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. Don't waste your money."
5,Awesome Game,This is my first flying game and I love it. It is so much fun learning the controls and flying all over the place. I recommend it to everyone who loves playing games.
1,"Way, Way Too Hard","Unless you fly or flew P-30's you won't be able to get past the ""Training"" part of the game. The plane stalls, the controls are mushy and the flight characteristics of the planes are insane; my hat is off to all the aviators in WWII who mastered these stall prone, sluggish response war birds. Give me the over powered jets in Air Combat 4 any day."
1,would have been 6/5 stars if it had worked,"I paid about 20$ for this game brand new in the case sealed and i was practricly standing on my mail box waiting for it. When i got it, to my suprise, instead of playing for hours without blinking, it did not work...... it loaded up to the menus and that alone was why i gave it 1 star... before the campaign it just stayed on the loading screen for maby an hour and i just gave up on it.....dont buy this game! save yourself the hard earned dowe and buy san andreas and shoot down jets with the ""rustler"" instead."
1,"Heroes, smeroes","Heroes of the PacificThis game sucks. I've been flying MS Flight Sim for a couple of years. I thought a PS2 game might be better since the 'computer' is designated for the game. I failed to consider the stupidity of programmers. It seems that realism is something of which they are completely unaware. The 'targets' are either too close too quick or too far away for the unrealistic amount of time given to complete the level. And the side shots or flybys are not just stupid, they interfere with your concentration and smoothness. I'll stick to driving games on PS2. I'm going back to the computer for flight."
5,"Well built, great quality, great looks, great food",I have owned this grill for a few months and am one very satisfied customer. It was easy to assemble; we were eating venison burgers within two hours of starting the project. It cooks very evenly and gets to a remarkable 600 degrees F for quick searing. The built-in thermometer is accurate and easy to use and the flame and temperature are easy to control. Sauteeing vegetables is quick and painless on the side burner; also very easy to use. I would (and have) recommend this grill to all my friends. A great product!
3,"Pleasent, diverting,but not vital","Like many electronica recordings, this CD is a plesent - although hardly vital - diversion. The duo manages to blend thier unique brand of dance, elecronica and jazz in an altogether gratifying manner, spiciing thinigs up with bits and peices of Euro-audio verite'. Some of the songs, such as the title peice, manage a breezy gentleness that belie thier danceable nature; most of the others, while danceable enough, never quite manage to deliver on thier promise. Far from being a dance recording in the guise of Dj-driven electronica, this is competant DJ-driven electronica that attempts to adopt the guise of a dance recording."
3,British revolver patents,"Like its two companion books, this book describes revolvers made on the basis of British patents issued during this period. The American reader will not be familiar with many of these revolvers. However, many American firearms are included. There is a section describing the firearms in chronological order. A section with brief information on the patent holders. And a section listing the patents and what they basically covered.Several important double action revolver systems were developed during this period: for example, the basic Nagant system.I found it dry and boring. But thorough and complete."
4,Long Life,"My mother insisted on Stride Rites when I was a kid. She must have known something because these shoes have lasted longer for my son than other brands. Yes, they did wear out. My son plays hard and his shoes do not typically last until his feet outgrow them. However, these made it longer than all others that we have tried. They were comfortable and true to size."
4,Better than the sequel,"This point and click was a fun game. It's in 1st person in a 2D environment. It had at times a creepy atmosphere, but what I most remember is a feeling of discovery and curiousity. I enjoyed revealing the mystery with my character. I don't recall pixel hunting for clues and the story line revealed itself at a good pace. There were plenty of hotspots to keep me entertained but not so many that I wanted to pull my hair out, and they all added to the story (though in the end, they may not have all been necessary). It's been a while since I played it, but it is a game I thought good enough to keep and play again (which is pretty rare for me). The sequel to this ""Dark Fall:Lights Out"" I didn't like, the whys you can see in that review."
4,Very Enjoyable,I was looking for a puzzle game and spooky atmosphere when I came across this game. I wasn't disappointed. With a set of headphones and the lights down I had a lot of fun letting myself get caught up in the game. The puzzles aren't super hard. I only got stuck once. Some of the puzzles seemed a little dependent on how well you clicked your mouse instead of whether you actually could figure out the logic behind them which could get aggravating. I do wish the plot had been a bit more interactive. I finished the game without really being sure just what had happened to some of the characters.All in all I would recommend this game. I find my biggest criticism is that it was really too short. I would have enjoyed playing it longer and exploring more of the setting.
4,Atmospheric,"This game is worth playing mainly because of its creepy atmosphere, which unnerved me at first! The puzzles are pretty good and the ending was a bit lame, but I still enjoyed it and recommend it for anyone who likes suspenseful mystery in a very well constructed environment."
2,Mind-Boggling and Arm-Acheing,"I played this game after my older sister played. I listened in on it, but didn't pay attention to what was on the game. I thought I would try my hand at it on my computer. Two days later after finishing the game, I don't even want to look at it again.The graphics are okay, the sound effects are done really well, but for the most part, ARRGGHH!! My arm is acheing after all the click, click, clicking around. Once I had got to the end, I was just about hitting my head on the wall, because of all the stuff that I had to get, but didn't have just to solve the last bit of it.The story had promise, but there was an awful lot of useless information in the game that didn't coincide with what was releavant to the game. If you want a good story try the Atlantis games by Dreamcatcher, even the Riddle of the Sphinx's were good.I'm holding out hope that the sequel to this game is good, but we'll just have to wait and see what the reviews have to say."
3,So-So Game,"The graphics are just okay. The storyline is so-so. There is a lot of notetaking to do! Just try to use your head and write down the important stuff. It is a bit hard to gather what will be important, but you will get the hang of it. There is a lot of reading, but it adds to the story. If you don't read everything, it will make the game more boring with a less interesting tale. The game is not scarey, nothing is going to jump out and make your heart race. There are a few creepy sounds and that is it. Some of the puzzles are too easy, yet a couple took some figuring out. It is a lot of the same stuff over and over it feels, which gets a bit boring. I lost interest in it from the moment I started, but completed the game anyway. It is not the worse game, but I suppose could be better. I hope I like the second one more, if I even bother."
4,My First Computer Game,"This was my first computer game that I ever played, so I did not have anything to compare it to. I enjoyed playing and I was never board. I didn't have time to be with all the note taking. I just thought that was what you did in these type of games.As far as the puzzles go, all the clues were given to you so if you had them, the puzzles were not all that hard to figure out. Even the one with buttons.I am from the Atari generation so, to me, the graphics were great. Since playing Syberia, I know the difference. I was actually board with Syberia at first because I didn't have to take notes!All in all it was a great game. I did not like the ending at all, it made it seem like a dream. I do hope that DarkFall II will have a better ending."
3,Dark Fall,Not the usual game I buy. Sounded better than it is. Play is ok but slow. Graphics are great.
2,Most disappointing game I've played in a long time,"I bought this game based on the great reviews, but I was very, very disappointed when I finally played it. I'm surprised this didn't come in a set of 3.5"" disks instead of on a CD. If you like playing games that look like they were made in 1990, then this game is for you. Everything about this game is cheap and behind-the-times. Navigating one full screen at a time (instead of actually ""walking"" from place to place"" severely detracts from the game's realism and playability. If you want to waste a few dollars on a game you'll only play once or twice, I suggest you buy this game."
5,Fantastic!,"If you're looking for a game to really make you think, Dark Fall is for you. It is delightfully creepy (the designer, if I remember correctly, is a former ghost-hunter, and the knowledge gained there is evident here) and has above-average graphics.The game can occasionally be frustrating when you realize that the clue you need is going to make you backtrack, but for the most part, the puzzles are tough but solvable--a few require an extra leap of logic, which only makes it all the more satisfying when you figure it out.And, finally, I highly recommend playing this game with another person. Not only does that make it more fun--you *will* get swept up into the plot, and it's great to have someone to talk about it with--but having two perspectives on a lot of the puzzles makes it a bit easier. I played through it with my boyfriend, and we're still wondering what happened with a few of the characters..."
3,Hard game to start,This was too hard for me to get into and get going with. I have played many like this but this particular game was just to time consuming and hard to get going. I eventually just gave it away. They even had a hard time with it. If you like hard games and one that will try your patience and mind then this would be a great game for you. I like a more relaxing type seek-n-find game.
4,"Creepy, but short, and a lot of reading","Good job on ambiance - this game is pretty creepy. Shadows, flickering lights, voices, whispers, ghostly shenanigans. There is a sense of imminent danger to your person (don't worry, though, you can't actually die in this game). The gameplay was straight forward and simple, the puzzles weren't too tough. However, there was a TON of reading, and you cannot take any of the materials with you. SO TAKE LOTS OF NOTES. One disappointment - it's so short! I literally played the whole game in one day."
4,"Spooky, creepy, and captivating. edit: See comments for info re: suitability for hearing loss","""Dark Fall"" has a neat look and an interesting story, but I found it a bit hard to know what to do. It's also extremely easy to get lost, especially in the hotel. If it had a way of asking for help (like a cell phone option or something) and more help saving (I'd NEVER seen a game save like that, and it took me 3 times to actually make a save and not have to start over), I'd rate it 5 stars in a minute!! Also, it's NOT captioned for the hearing impaired."
3,"An ""approachable"" version of his larger work.","This is a ""more approachable"" version of Meyendorff's larger and more scholarly tome on St. Palamas, which remains to this day the definitive work on the monk. This shorter version includes numerous photographs and a good level of background/historical detail. Those with a general (non-scholarly) interest in learning more about Gregory Palamas will find it especially convenient; though it will fail to satisfy those with a desire for in-depth academic information."
5,Just a Masterpiece!!,"I haven't been listening to traditional Indian music for quite some time, and this one turned out be a masterpiece. A must buy for all fans of traditional and non traditional Indian music. It's just beautiful.. espl. while playing in the background while at work."
4,Fredom Fighters,"As chris one of the many fredom fighters you and your pals have to kill the soveits invading Ney Yourk/America. This is a fun action packet game were your most valublue weapon is your squad. You comand them to kill people,attack places,and scout out places and much more. Their are 6 differant kinds of guns in this game that you can choose from all with a differant pupus. If you are a kid who likes playing games full of action and if you like to comand squads in games than this is a game for you."
4,Funny,"This book was full of good old Dungeons & Dragons humor which I find hillarious. If you're a D&D dork, like me, you'll definately like this book. It's got a good pace, and it's full of classic D&D, AD&D, and Bard's Tale humor."
1,"great picture, not so great writing...","HI< i have just recently read this book, and i have yet 2 things to say. First, after reading this book for the 5th and 6th time, i have concluded that ned has a certain dissorder. now this is a dissorder that is otherly known as "" fugitive fantasy fear"" , now basicly all im trying to say is that this book has no meaning. I have had more excitement watching snails race, then reading this book. I constently read it over and over, just to see if i can find a meaning. It has no feal. the expostion of this book is mediocre and outlandished. I understand that this is a teenage author, so im not crizite you any more then i already did. The other thing i had to say is the fact that the mood personafyes a perticular meaning to the reader, that does not dignify a self conscious comprehensable understanding of the book.(...)"
1,not satisfied,"Not satisfied with this product at all. I purchased it since the bottles that come with the pump are polycarbonate. These bottles do not seal properly. If you try to shake the bottle, it leaks everywhere. Even during pumping if you hold the bottle at an angle at all, it sometimes leaks. There are not enough rings at the opening for the bottles to close completely. The least the company could do is make good substitutes for their polycarbonate bottles - since it seems to me they quietly market the fact that these bottles can replace polycarbonate bottles as a ""safe"" alternative."
1,Not dependable at all.. Constant shutdowns,"Mr. Heater Big Maxx 75,000 BTU Natural Gas Garage Unit Heater #MHU75NGWe purchased this heater for our new 2 car garage. It arrived with the package damaged and the top of the heater dented. The dent appeared to be just cosmetic so we tested and it seemed to work fine. We had it professionally installed. It worked fine for about a week. Then it kept shutting down due to the flame out sensor tripping. We did some research and were finally able to resolve that. It operated fine for about another week then kept shutting down again. This time it was the fuse on the circuit board being poorly installed by the mfg. It was loose and every time the heater gets up to temperature it would lose contact with the circuit board. After that was fixed it worked fine for about a month. Now it keeps shutting down for no apparent reason... So now we are chasing yet another problem. I highly advise anyone to find another heater. This one is nothing but problems."
5,The heat is on!!,The heater came fast and I was happy to see it was in great shape (came UPS you know) I hung a 2X4 in the rafters and pulled it up to location with a come-a-long. I used all thread rod to mount it. This allowed to adjust the final height when hooking up the gas. I used black pipe all the way with no flex hose. I bought a digital thermostat and that was it. Very quiet. I do need to look into adjustments for elevation as we live above 4000 ft.
5,Amazing......,"I bought this product and thought it might be less smaller than the picture, but i was wrong...it's size is big enough, it's obvious from it's wieght, it's worth the price and even more.Just get it, and u won't regret."
3,Good hamper. Could have been great.,"All the other reviews tell the good points. I only have 2 things to add.1. When even half way full, the sides bow out a little. Easy to fold for shipping. Would have been nicer to deal with the larger shipping container and not get a folding side. It doesn't look good when it bows out like that. It doesn't do that in the picture.2. Velcro on the lid is annoying. I don't want to hear and have to pull the velcro before placing laundry in, or taking it out. It would have been better to have a lid that didn't have the velcro."
2,Not Good,"I have had this hamper for about a year, and it is starting to fray and fall apart. Not worth the price when you just have to replace it in a year."
4,Very Nice,I was a little disappointed when I opened this package because it doesn't look exactly like the picture. I wouldn't describe this as wicker either. It really looks more like woven sea grass. It is still very nice though and we are very pleased with it. A great deal.
4,It's worth more than what you'll pay,"We have an antique house and are fairly mindful of the aesthetics regarding anything we put in it. All that being true, I am diametrically opposed to spending a lot of money on a clothes hamper. This one is completely functional and looks just fine. I am actually buying precisely the same one for another room in the house."
4,Good quality and good looking,"Simple enough - it's a quality made hamper and looks nice. It has two handles to carry it with, and it folds down if you're not using it."
3,"Ok at first, but breaks easily",The top flap split in half after about 1 year of owning this hamper. I had to throw it out. I would purchase a wicker hamper or something made with better quality. The sides/top/bottom are filled w/ cheap cardboard.Works if you're gentle w/ it. Wouldn't purchase again.
3,"Price, size, looks are good. Smells bad, flimsy.","Good points: it's inexpensive and looks attractive for the price. It's just the right color and shape for my place. It's light-weight and easy to carry down the narrow hall to the laundry.Bad points: it smells. I've had it for six weeks and have left it outside, sprayed the heck out of it with Febreze, kept dryer sheets in it and it still just stinks inside. It smells, at least to me, like vomit. Not a typical plastic kind of smell. Because of its good points I'm going to hang onto it for a few months and see if the smell will fade, at least to a dirty-laundry smell. If not, out it goes. It's kind of flimsy and I had to retie the handle knots. You can't be really rough with it.Other reviewers report that it mildews if you put damp things into it, which I haven't done. It would be better if the lining came out for washing, but it doesn't. So not a bathroom-type hamper."
4,Very hampery,"Well what can you say about a laundry basket. It's a good size, sturdy construction and looks pretty good. Like others have said, it smells a little funny, but not bad. I chose it as the best looking practical hamper at a reasonable price and I think I was right in doing so."
2,Kind of a disapointment,"I was really excited to watch this because normally I love Ghibli films. Sadly, this one doesn't make the cut. The art is quite good, though it almost looks like they pulled a Disney and reused other art (namely Nasaca). However, it was very dark for the light hearted art style and I just found the plot to be lacking. I wasn't impressed enough to want to buy this one."
5,Beautiful,Such a big fan of Miyazaki's father that it was such a joy to see a movie made from him. So definitely if you are a fan I do recommend
3,Intersting,"Now don't get me wrong i think the story is interesting how ever it kinda drag out. i like these types of movie but the way the story was to;d was awful. i only reason why i watch the entire movie is because, once i start a movie i have to see it to the end. Just be catuies when watching this movie it can definitive put you to bed"
3,DaFoe Go Home to the Bee Cave....,"W. DaFoe RUINS this production with his bizarre, over the top WHISPERING voice which I cannot believe the director let him do.I understood may be 5% of what he was saying, and soon all the characters were whispering to match his tempo and and i have NO IDEA what the &^%$ was going on.Also, they never explained: how and why the sword was magic; how the (blank) became a dragon; what the hell else was going on.I give this extra credit for design, fight coordination, and graphics, otherwise it sucked :)But BUY IT, yes!"
3,"Dear Ghibli, Good Art Can Only Get You So Far...","The characters in this movie had promise. I say ""had"" because every one of them disappoint. The hero is a loose amalgam of light and darkness--he is wimp and crazed killer at the same time. The heroines generally play second fiddle, at least until one of them transforms (I won't tell you into what, but it rhymes with ""flagon""), and the arch mage turns out to be an arch bore (although he sounded good). The evil guy, whose gender wasn't entirely clear at first, was sufficiently evil and slimey, but turned out to be not much of a threat (except to stone structures). The story was confusing and seemed loosley cobbled together (this is true for a lot of Ghibli films). From what I can gather, the film was about the balance between life and death, light and darkness, yin and yang, or something like that. On the plus side, nice art splashes across the screen every other scene or so. The skyscapes are particularly good. Not the best Ghibli film."
1,The first words out my mouth when I finished watching this was...,"Terrible.Lets just get this straight. I LOVE Studio Ghibli, I have watched all of the movies ( many times!) and hold the studio very close to my heart. Which is why I am shocked and appaled that Hayao Miyazaki allowed this son to produce such an awful film!There is no plot whatsoever, the action scenes are boring, the characters dull and lifeless. This was the first Studio Ghibli where I had to force myself to finish it! If you're like me, and you love Studio Ghibli with a passion, DON'T be fooled by the pretty animation, LISTEN to the other 1 and 2 star reviews on here, THEY ARE RIGHT!! I didn't listen, and I payed the price for having to sit through this terrible excuse for a film."
3,No wonder........,"This one had mixed reviews from critics and that included me! I really loved nearly all the works of Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki-san (or Mr. Miyazaki's son rather!) but this one is a bit of a let down. The plot started with good and interesting scenes, until the mid-plot came...it kind of dragged, festered with unnecessary and boring scenes that could have been replaced with exciting signature ""Miyazaki climax"" that we know and love.The music had the consistency of a blinking old bulb from your basement. I thought they lacked on this department as well since you will barely recall that it had musical scores after watching this piece..meh.To end my rant, I'd say this one is a must rent not own movie from Studio Ghibli."
2,Don't Sugar Coat it,"I love Miyazaki, and I never imagined I would have to say this... This film sucks. The fun rollercoaster dynamic style and pace you are used to will not be found here. I can't believe people would take the time to review this and then send other fans after this film with ratings that are above 2 stars. If you are a huge Miyazaki fan like me, you most definitely will be disappointed by how lacking this one is compared to his other films. You will get no action, and then very little, for over 70 minutes. If you have to have it for collection purposes, then make room on your shelf, cause it ain't moving but once. If you are about to spring for what you hope to be another Ponyo, Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, etc., then you need to either borrow it first or rent it. I am trying to save you some green so heed my warning as a fellow fan. Love Miyazaki, but I'm calling this one how it really is."
4,"Lovely movie, impossible menus","The movie is lovely, though all the menus are in Chinese and were thusly impossible to navigate. I'm also a little baffled by the full length pencils version being touted as an extra. If you buy this version of the discs and need English subtitles you'll likely have to access them directly through your media player."
2,Disappointing,"As a Miyazaki/Ghibli and a Le Guin fan I must say this movie falls short on both fronts. I gave it two stars because the animation is quite beautiful, but the plot is meaningless and the characters shallow. On top of that it's pretty slow and boring. It feels like they put Earthsea in a blender with Princess Mononoke and then only gave us the foamy crud at the top of the smoothy. Yes, the characters have the same names as the characters in Earthsea, but it doesn't go much deeper than that. I really don't see the point of going on here, strictly second rate Ghibli. Too bad."
3,"Amazing annimation, not so great storytelling","Lets start out by saying I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan. Ok, except for Grave of the Fireflies which was depressing as hell. However I have never read the Earthsea series, so I did not know what to expect going in. The movie started out confusing me and just kind of went downhill from there. The backgrounds were, as always fantastic, but the storyline seemed to be lacking major pieces to explain what was going on. And the dragons seemed like badly spliced in CG among the rest of the animation. Most of the expressions of the characters was limited and did not meet my expectations. Still it had wonderful character designs and artwork, and the movie was entertaining. Maybe I just have too high of standards for this animation company, but I do not think it was up to their normal standards."
2,Great imagery- shame about the plot,"My family and I have read and re-read the Earthsea Quartet and most of Ursula Le Guin's literary work for many years, so when I found this film I was hopeful. The landscapes were beautiful and picturesque but that is the extent of the film for me. We were horrified to see that the writers scrambled all four books into an incoherent mess. Confusing and removing most of what made these novels such timeless classics. No coherent explanation justified Arren's murder of his father let alone giving him the shadow. Unforgivable. I feel for Ursula.While I can accept and enjoy a film which has been adapted (properly), this was not worth my time."
2,Beautifully animated but terrible story telling,"I read some of the reviews before watching this movie. I tried not to expect too much from it. I found the movie beautifully animated. Yet it got very frustrating when I found myself unable to really explain the story to my kids. The story line and characters are just poorly developed. Love the older Studio Ghibli movies. This one, not so much."
2,"""I sense the light dimming.""","Since I read the original Earthsea ""trilogy"" eons ago, I won't make any comparisons between those books and this mockery of an adaptation. Hey, if Ursula K. Le Guin didn't like it, why should I?My main objection with this lethargic mess concerns the dead slow pace at which the barely coherent plot unraveled. With only bits and fits of sporadic action, I found the story less then compelling. It's completely devoid of wonder, and, oddly enough, magic. I also found some of the voice-work questionable. A long musical interlude didn't help matters either. It's a pity Le Guin can't sue. But! Having Disney and Studio Ghibli vying for ""over the title top billing"" should at least take some of the sting out of this enormous insult to her collection of books."
3,BORING!,Hayao Miyazaki should have let his son make this movie cause it sucks. He's not creative like his dad. Storyline sucks and needs more imagination. Kudos for the animation though.
3,earthsea,if you have never read the books or even talk with some one who has you may be confused about whats going on other then that it was a pretty good anime
4,Operating Instructions for Japanese menus,"Menus are shown only in Japanese.

2,Tedious,"Such a miss. This film was long, drawn out, boring, confusing, short on adventure, and not very interesting. From the title ""Tales from Earthsea"" I thought this would tell a very good story...it was disappointing and flat. I will not watch this again. I may consider reading the Earthsea books instead.Does not measure up to other Studio Ghibli films."
1,Pretty pictures! and that's it...,"This movie was the biggest waste of 2 hours I've ever succumbed to. The pictures were lovely, yes. Everything else about it was terrible. I'm still confused about the whys and hows of what took place in this story. The author of the Tales of Earthsea series even writes on her website that she doesn't think this movie does her tales justice. This movie had potential, but key plot details are left out that make it confusing and unsatisfying."
1,Fan of the book series but seriously disappointed,"Normally I don't buy things in person before reading reviews but I made an exception this time because a)I just finished reading the first 3 books in the Earthsea series and really enjoyed it b)it claims to be directed by Miyazaki.But what a mistake that was. If you are a fan of the series looking for a remake of it in cinematic form, this is NOT it. The director basically chopped up the tale and reused characters where he saw fit. This wouldn't have been problematic if it was actually well done but it wasn't. The plot was awkward and did not make much sense and the characters' actions were unbelievable (such as the explanation as to why Arren kills his father in the first 5s of the movie).I would've given this 0 stars if I could. Do not waste your time or money."
1,Poof!,"The Asante 6 in 1 memory card reader is the so called ""Gini""which made 75 of my pictures disappear from a 128 meg compact flash card.This device working on Windows XP is incapable of reading more than 1 memory card insertion at a session - in other words if you have more than 1 card of the same type you cannot read the second card without first removing the ""Gini"" drive and thenrestarting it via its USB plug.Worse, if you use the same card with differant information on it, re-inserting it in the drive will completely screw the file structure of the card, requiring that the card be reformatted.You know what that means.No doubt the design is attractive, but the unit is cheaply made,the SD slot had a bend in the interior metal probably making that slot unuseable.If you are using 2 types of memory cards try to keep it simple and use a reader specifically designed for those two."
4,Children in Worship,An excellent resource for creating a worshipful experience for Children in the church. Much more than just canned children's sermon
5,Excellent Children's Worship Program,"This book includes explaination, 41 stories (lessons), and plans for materials needed of a great worship service children really get into. I have been doing this program for 2 years and my children are incredible. I wish the adults would have this much respect. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a successful worship program for their children."
4,THIS IS THE BEST!!!!!,"I just got a game boy advance SP for Xmas.And so I got Sims Bustin Out.So far its the best.Ive been playing it everyday almost all day.There's goals you have to do,you get a house, theres lots of stores and places to go,you get a scooter,you can have a roomate, and much much more.I have a roomate, and s dog and Im living in my third house.Ive beaten a lot of goals and only have to unlock 3 more jobs.But anyway buy this game, you wont regret it!!!!!!!!"
5,Well worth the Simoleans!,"This game is incredible. Just like the original sims, it is a bit deceptive. At first glance it appears to be just a novelty... next thing you know it's 4am and you've broken out in a cold sweat, your thumbs hurt, and you promise yourself you'll go to sleep after you unlock the next goal. It is highly addictive fun. If you are a fan of the original Sims, you will not be disappointed.I have a hard time getting into fantasy role playing games because I could never keep the goals straight. I never quite knew why I was doing the things I was supposed to be doing... Sims is just like real life. (okay it's closer to real life). The goals and missions are not foreign, they make sense. There isn't any magical quest or a princess to save, the sims could take place right in your neighborhood."
5,Good,"I got The Sims Bustin' Out for Christmas. It was one of the three games that I got, and this one is by far the most addictive. It has good graphics, and the music and sounds are a lot like the Sims for the computer. There are a few nics in the game, for instance in one mission, you have to buy a shower. If you already bought and sold a shower they consider it as buying the shower, but not selling it. You can't get through the rest of the game because of that. The game can be a little boring at times, but it's a lot of fun. Sometimes its a little hard to manuvere the person around, but the game gets a lot easier once you get the scooter from Dusty Hoggs. After you are allowed to search the whole town, and not just the general store and the Burning Spoke, it gets a little confusing, because you can get lost easily. Luckily, there is a map if you press the select button and you should have no problem after that. All in all, this is a good game, and it's worth the $29.99."
3,"Gerat fun, but not in the way I expected","The Bustin' Out games are nothing like the original The Sims for PC. Rather, it is designed for those looking for something fun to do without that much thinking and calculating. You control a sim in a small town as he/she advances through a series of tasks which ultimately end up getting him/her bigger houses. It's fun for the while, but it is not a portable version of The Sims for PC, if that's what you're expecting"
4,"should come with a label that says ""highly addictive""","This game is cut from a different cloth. Once you get into it, even just slightly, more than likely you will be hooked 100%. The irony of it all is that the game has you doing ordinary, daily chores as opposed to fighting aliens or pulling armed robberies like in other popular games. I would suggest buying a Gameboy Advance SP if you don't already own one--if not, you will suffer from back/neck aches from playing for hours on end without a light. Highly recommended."
4,I love it,I love this game. It's very hard to put down. It's not very hard or very easy. It's just right. You start out living on your uncle's farm the you have to do a few simple goals and then you can move into the barn. One good thing about this game is that the game get a bit more challenging as you go on. It's very fun and i would recommend it to anyone about 7 and up.
1,NOT FOR GB advanced,Hello even on the cover the graphics are terible!!!!!!!!! By the way on PS2 you can actually the people don't waste your MONEY!!!!!! It is TERIBLE FOR GAMEBOY ADVANCED
5,Different Than Others,This version of Bustin Out is completely different from other versions of bustin out. I love that you can control your person while she drives her scooter around town. It is a bit more free play. You still have the goals to meet and objects to obtain. You visit a store in order to purchase items for your home. There is also a pet store to buy pets from and a gift store to buy gifts to give to friends.The design of your sim is very limited. They have tops and bottoms. You can change the colors but not the style. Same thing going on with the shoes. You pick a face and then the hair style and color.In the end it is a fun game to play. It is nice to have the portability of the gameboy. I love laying in bed with my gameboy and this game. It is easier to handle than a lap top and that puts it on the top of my list.
4,Better than what you'll think,"This is going to be a reallys unique Sims game. Instead of the pick here type you can actual control you sim just as if you were playing an RGP or any other game where you can wonder around and move. Since you control it you can only have an NPC room mate, and you can have cat or a dog too. You can drive the car and do mini games, and just do regular The Sims stuff. there are 8 different mini games like lawn mowing, cliff diving and pizza game. You can also have your sim actuall swim in the pool and be able to control it. There are no kids in the game and you can't build a h ouse but only decorate the premade houses. There are levels you have to complete, and it should take you a good 30-40 hours just to do levels, but you can spend as long as you wanting playing it. There are 150 unlockable objects and there is a new auction mode. You can also hook it up to you Gamecube The Sims and trade simleons and objects too. Overall it's a must for any The Sim fan."
5,A Game that is Hard to put Down,"When I first got the sims bustin out,i thought you could build houses like the computer game.But that isnt the truth. You have goals and once you reach all of them in your section you get promoted to a better house.At first i thought i wouldnt like that, but i really think the sims on gameboy is better than the computer version. I think the jobs are really fun, and my favorite part of the game is the characters.Once i got this game it was very difficult to put down(kind of like a good book). Once you get new goals its hard to put the game away until you reach them.Another good thing about the sims on gameboy is that it doesnt take forever to load like it does on the computer. This is one of the best games i have ever played."
3,Cut Short,"I have always been a fan of The Sims but it seems to me that if the Sims isn't on the PC it isn't good. For example take the Gamecube edition, it isn't good and is so much worse than the one on the PC. Bustin' Out is no exception. I spent $64 on something i thought would be excellent but was cut short. This game is too fast and isn't that hard. You can't have children, get married, build a house. It has cool minigames but nothing to rave about. A pro is you can move around on the D-Pad. I thought this was ok but not worth $64. Wait till it gets cheaper. This isn't like the Sims on PC so don't expect the same game."
4,EXC,"I think this game is exc because i've play it for PS2 and it is awesome. I'll buy it, it is on my wish list."
3,...nice enough.,I received the product as expected and on time. It's very fundamental in scope with little written instruction but it's been helpful.
5,best book in a long time,"according to my expertise this book was great. I would have never expected the wonderful ending. It kept me on the edge the whole time. I am not a can't put the book down person but WOW this one really did it. I read until the end without stopping once, and I can not wait until this author writes another. She is great, wish I could write like that. I give it an A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
1,Poorly written debut novel,"This is a first time novelist, and it shows. It is full of problems, beginning with the characterization. They don't act or speak like real people would, and don't even act like the character, unrealistic as they may be, that the writer has created. The other reviewer is right, there are lots of twists and turns, but these too are unrealistic. Some things are so absurd it's almost funny. Fiction is story-telling, but the best stories are those which could be real. This novel does not live up to that expectation."
5,Perfect,"These tea bells arrived as promised and were just perfect for what I needed. Nice size, nice sound, no hassle."
1,waste of money,Blitz 33710 Metal CARB Can Conversion KitThis was a big dissapointment. I've got leaks because it doesn't seal right. It is difficult to remove the cap. The spout is way too short it also makes pouring gas extremelt difficult (because of size and safety valve).
2,You get what you pay for,"I've had this product for a year and a half. The cart feels cheaply made, with thin canvas and a light frame. The frame is held together with little screws, and they wobble loose every couple months and have to be re-tightened. I lost one screw that unscrewed itself, and now the whole thing is wobbly and unstable. The compartments are not separate bags, just canvas with dividers, and you can't take the compartments out. I end up turning the whole thing upside down to dump my clothes of the floor for folding. Good for light or temporary use, I would say."
5,"So great, I bought two!","I bought myself one of these laundry sorters and liked it so much, I bought my boyfriend one. It's very easy to put together and is very strong. I had one before made of plastic and it fell apart from the weight of the clothes, but this one is much better. The three compartments make it much easier to sort clothes and you can throw your clothes right into the washer. I keep mine in the closet and wheel it over to the washing machine."
1,You get what you pay for,"My cart has barely survived just a semester at school. The frame shifts back and forth, the screws come loose, and the wheels fall off. I have had to superglue the screw fixtures back into the bars. This product is cheap and not worth the price paid for it.Also, one of my compartments ripped. I sew it back together, but it adds to the over all poor quality of this product."
1,Don't Bother With This One.,This thing fell apart the first time I wheeled it to the laundry room. Wheels got stuck in a crack and just like that it was broken. Another problem is that it is designed to hold more laundry than it can handle. Pass this one by.
1,WORST BUY EVER,"This is the single worst thing I've ever bought on amazon. It fell apart the FIRST time I used it - it is made VERY cheaply. Even before it fell apart I noticed that it was very rickety. If you are using it for anything other than just a stand-alone hamper, and you want to actually use it to roll your hamper to the laundry machines, do NOT buy this product. It is a waste of money. Mine is currently covered in duct tape and I'm planning on throwing it away as soon as I get a new one."
5,Light and Sturdy,"Lightweight aluminum frame holds it together sturdily. Easy to assemble. Canvas is easy to wash and keep fresh. No lid, unlike most hampers. For me, that just makes it easier to toss clothes in basketball-style :-)"
4,Very handy!,I just love this sorter! It's the right size that it doesn't get in the way...there is plenty of room for all the laundry and it's a very neutral color. The only think I could wish for is that it would have 4 compartments instead of just 3...but I'm more than satisfied just the same. I even bought a few of them as gifts for friends with inquisitive puppies and exploring babies. The price can't be beat!
1,wheels come off,after afew months the wheels keep falling off and all the screws are coming out. stay away.
2,not that great,"i bought this product, and it was great to keep dirty clothes in, but the rollers were not that great. and it leaned a lot."
2,misleading,"The product looks much sturdier and reliable than it really is; the materials were not as durable as described, and the other customers who purchased it alongside me were very disappointed as well, as it was supposed to be a gift."
2,Get something else,"This thing does what it's suppose to do, and that is keep clothes sorted. I received it with half a broken wheel, which inst worth trying to get a replacement. The wheel attachments are cheap as well. they don't fit snug. not worth $20, maybe $15 tops."
3,"works, but not high quality",Its not very stable no matter how tight you tighten everything. The wheels have fallen off a few times when pushing over carpet.
1,Missing lots of pieces...,"So I just ordered this and it came today. I'm missing the wheels, all of the bolts and the hex key to put it together. Very disappointing."
2,Poor quality,"Its pretty poor quality, however, as shakey as this item is, its still hase not fallen apart.. so it gets a two."
1,Not what I expected,"Given its price, I purchased this laundry hamper NOT expecting a top of the line solution to my laundry needs but this hamper didn't even meet my lower expectations. The materials are cheap and flimsy, and under any kind of strain, the screws have a tendency to come loose and it jerks front and back when you pull it across the shortest of carpet. If you are going to use it for laundry, look for something else more durable. It might work for non-laundry functions (i.e. recycling)."
1,really a question,looks as if it is just what I want - but with a problem. Does it fold when not in use
2,Thought this would be nice but just too flimsy...,"Easy to assemble, looks very nice, rolls nicely... but the frame is just to flimsy for any real use. Tried to find good uses for it, but ended up giving it to Amvets charity a few months later. Needs a sturdy frame."
1,"Cheap, breaks easily!","As others wrote, the wheels come off very easily and quickly and need to be super-glued to stay in place. Furthermore, the canvas is very thin and tears easily if a compartment is filled to the top. All in all, a waste of $40!"
2,Disapointment,"Started to fall apart 20minutes after I put it together. It is very unstable. Not suprised though, I got what I paid for. I should know better than to go for the good deal."
3,Laundry Sorter,"Delivered quickly, but one of the cross bars had a faulty fastener, so had to request a replacement part from Whitney Design through their website. Prompt response and supply of replacement part, professionally handled.Overall, the unit is OK...a bit flimsy in structure, but value for money."
1,cheap construction,"Don't waste your money. I wish I had payed a little more for a better contruction. This thing can't handle the laundry load for 2 people. Several screws were striped within a week and the divider between the compartments ripped out like nothing.Just don't do it, seriously, unless you dont put a lot of clothes in it (than whats the point?) and you are feeling lucky."
1,wheels come off....very unsturdy!,i barely used this sorter a couple times when the frame started shifting back and forth & the wheels started falling off. what a huge waste of money. i will now spring for a more expensive one & hope the quality is better.
1,Hated It,"This is assembled using screws. I had to repeatedly get the small allen wrench used to tighten the screws, and was forever struggling to get it in the screw hole and tighten. there are tons of screws and the screws are always too loose to properly manuver. Spring for the more expensive ones that dont use screws. I wasted $$ on this plus shipping. Wish I had just gotten the nicer one to start with."
2,Handy... Sometimes,"This is a great hamper in theory; however, the reality of it is disappointing. After about a month of use, the screws all loosened leaving the hamper a wobbly mess. I continuously have to tighten the screws even now. After about 2 months the wheels began to fall off while rolling my laundry to the laundry room. At first I thought it was a one time incident until they all began to randomly fall off one by one. I've found it easier to take the wheels off completely and carry it even though it can be rather heavy."
3,Does the job but.....,"I love the fact that there are 3 compartments to put your dirty laundry in. It's got the wheels for easily moving your laundry to your washing machine (unless you have to go up and down the stairs). But in this case, the convenience comes with a cost. The frame is poorly designed. Other reviews mentioned that the wheels were not sturdy enough, but I haven't had that problem (yet). The frame however, CONSTANTLY needs to be tightened. The metal is cheap and light, and feels like it can break easily. If you don't mind the weekly maintenance, then by all means, it will be great to have around the apartment."
5,"For $14 bucks, it sucks","Did have to go buy a 6mm x 25mm regular thread metric screw for $0.30 as it was missing one. The nylon hamper needs to be removable for occasional washing, I think. This one requires disassembly of the top frame for that. ........Update 6 months later......whew, what a hunk of junk. Wheels are coming off, screws are falling out, it leans to one side. Thank goodness for duct tape, it will fix anything. I would give this one star now only because the duct tape works."
1,Looks great and then falls apart!,"This product started out wonderfully. It was relatively easy to put together and worked exactly as I needed it to (I was very pregnant and had to take my laundry across a parking lot to the laundry room in my apartment complex.) But within a couple months, the screws holding it together started falling out. And within a couple more months, the wheels were falling out constantly. Now I am online looking for a new laundry cart because this one is so impossible to keep together! And it has been less than a year since I bought it. I am very frustrated to say the least!"
5,An incomprable classic,"My mother bought me this book almost fifty years agoMud Pies and Other Recipeswhen I just learned to read at six years old and I actually created most of the recipes in the book. When I found my dog-eared little copy, I stopped and reread it with so much joy. This is still one of the greatest treasures in my library."
5,Whimsical Delight,"Not only is this a beautifully done, charming book, but it encourages children to get outside and interact with the natural world - something that's become all too rare these days. Even better, it encourages them to do so by themselves and with friends, while using their imaginations.I've bought 2 copies as gifts for nieces and nephews and one more copy for the grandchildren I hope to have someday!"
2,sooooo ridiculously average.,"the only word for this cd is ""blah."" sure...it has a couple ok songs...but for the most part the cd is just an uninteresting sound. there isn't really any song on it that makes me want to listen to it. don't let anybody tell you that if you like Death Cab for Cutie that you will like this. they are liars."
3,Great Album but CD skips,CD look clean but skips on several songs I am disappointed that they don't check these before reselling them.The band and the album are great. That makes it all the more annoying when they skip.
4,...all out of bandages,"To call this band ""literate,"" would be an understatement, and to call this album simply ""good,"" or ""clever,"" would be an understatement so gross that it would be an exaggeration of...I came into this cd only knowing two songs ""Psalm for the Elks Lodge..."" and ""The Prescience of Dawn"", and admiring them greatly for the their lyrical genius, and gloriously soothing melodies. The lyrics on this record operate more like short, detailed descriptions of time and place that you would find scribbled in a journal under some early twentysomething's bed. They are verses built around the ideas of discovering loss, true happiness, and in some cases, the glory of obsession with small details and the thought processes of house cats.What you will find here is endlessly entertaining, and musically and lyrically sound without being technical, or outright anal.With Matthew Good, and now the Weakerthans, Canada is proving itself to me slowly. One day we might be friends."
3,"Still aimed at contemporary schoolboys, but more cohesive","This isn't the reason Wodehouse is still so popular, but it's an improvement on the earlier school stories. I probably enjoyed the boys' own adventures solving the crime and defeating the baddies as much as Wodehouse's distinctive expression. This isn't saying that the adventures are superb, rather that the expression (with occasional lovely exceptions) isn't yet as his superlative peak. I dare say this was perfectly pitched at the young contemporary audience he wrote it for."
2,"Buy this book then buy these products, Hello!","This book was disappointing. If you're looking for anything in depth look elsewhere. Plug ins and their use were given short shrift. A paragraph on the use of compressors, for instance. Not much more than you'd find in your user's manual. Suggestions for general use ok, but definitely not hands on. This book is meant for absolute beginners with emphasis on selling products that the author wants to promote or is being paid to promote."
2,Not a crowd pleaser,"After reading this book I am left with the question of what this story had to do with the Titanic. The reality is this is more of a coming of age story about a wealthy young boy than it is a book about the Titanic. The story could take place in Iowa for all the setting had to do with the disaster of 1912.Furthermore, the main character, Sumner Jordan, is quite unbelievable as a 12-year-old boy. In sections of the book Sumner's thoughts and emotions seem more like that of a 20 something; other times he seems more like a teenager, and once in a while a 12 year old emerges.The only character of any interest in the book is Pierce Andrews who unfortunately occupies a relatively brief part of the book. Overall the book is long to get started (do we really need all the family background?), slow to develop, and predictably ended."
3,great story line and lots of action,"im very happy with this book,i followed it the whole way through.i was pleased with the details about the people on the ""maiden voyage""."
2,Game not very good,Bought this game because enjoy playing. Thought this would give me limitless access. It is a very grainy picture and just not very fun.
1,Same as 2nd edition,Disappointed. Almost exactly the same as the 2nd edition.Infrogrames took over Hasbro and only made same small changes.
1,Nothing new,If you bought the 2nd edition there is nothing newexcept Vanna a bit older and a lot of bugs.Needs a patch which is not available.
1,Wheel of fortune 3 and and 2 are almost the same,"Wheel of fortune 3 and wheel of fortune 2 are almost the sameSame backgrounds, same options only change is Vanna dress"
2,Don't waste your money . . .,"All I wanted to do was get in there and solve puzzles, not wait for eternity while: the theme played, the introduction played, the spin/solve/buy-a-vowel icons came up, the letters marched across the screen, the vowels SEPARATELY marched across the screen, etc. I played for 20 minutes and got through TWO puzzles! They even take time to tell you about ""new prizes"" on the wheel, as though you were actually going to win them! I threw the thing in the trash."
3,Decent read,This was an easy one day read. I agree with past reviewers in that the ending WAS too convenient! What are the chances that you'll marry a one-night-stand? Very highly unlikely.
4,"Fun, fun, fun!",Simply Divine was a wonderful and entertaining read. If you enjoy light romantic comedy in the genre of Bridget Jones - you'll want to check out this book by Wendy Holden. Reviewed by Kelly Reno - Author of 'Misadventures & Merfolk'
3,"long, drawn out",Perhaps this should have been a short story. I forced my self to finish it. The characters needed some more development. Can't say it is a weekend read since it slows up. It did not flow well. It was some what funny but not very. It was also somewhat predicatible.
1,another bridget jones rip off,I expected this book to be along the lines of the new funny/romantic novels that sprung in the market since Helen Fieldings book became such a sucess. All I can say is close but no cigar. I believe that the sucess of Bridget Jones is that our heroine is a complete disaster but you can't help liking her. She and her friends are caricatures but somehow you can relate to them. The characters in this book are none of that. They are underdeveloped and everything is incredibly predictable right until the boring happy ending.If you want funny look elsewhere and if you want romantic I'm sorry but this is not the right book. I ended up with the feeling that Wendy Holden just didn't try very hard to make a good book.Better luck next time.
1,Simply awful!,"Maybe you have to be an avid reader of the 'upmarket' glossies like Tatler, and to think that IT girls are important, to enjoy this book. Personally, since I consider intelligence and ability to be far more important than looks and fashion, I found Simply Divine torture to read. Jane seemed to be both intelligent and sensible - so what on earth was she doing working for that kind of magazine and letting herself be talked into ghost-writing some lackwit socialite's column for her? Champagne wasn't just vacuous, she was repulsive, and the so-called humour left me cold.If this is a fair sample of this author's work, I won't be reading anything else by her."
4,"Funny, simple beach read","The comparisons to Bridget Jones are inevitable . . in fact, justified. Simply Divine chronicles the adventures of yet another 20-something Brit facing job woes, singlehood, and annoying friends and non-friends. I laughed out loud at some parts-- I pictured Champagne D'Vyne as the body of Pamela Lee with the voice of Fran Drescher. To anyone who doesn't read Vogue or Bazaar, the fashion name-dropping could get a little tiresome, but for anyone at all connected with that world, it's great fun. My only complaint was that the ending was a little too convenient. But that is what makes this such a fun, perfect for a day at the beach. Not too complicated, not too serious, but loads of fun."
2,Simply Horrible,"The only reason that I give this 2 stars is that it was a tiny bit better than her book, ""Bad Heir Day"". I guess I could give this book 1 star and the other 0 stars if Amazon would give the option. Champagne D'Vyne was just too stupid and mean of a character and I had a hard time not rolling my eyes everytime I read her silly name."
4,review,i found this book very enjoyable i can relate to what jane feels and how she overcomes this. i found this book very funny and it was a book which i found i could not put down.
1,horrible read,"simply divine isn't this book. the only reason i kept reading it was because i can never just put a book down in the middle. You never get to root for any one character. I thought Jane was over Tom, i certainly was! but whatever. This book simply does not flow. Her friend Tally? excuse me but what in the heck?! Simply not believable at all! It changes POV's from Tally, Jane, and Saul. I hate that in books. i do not recommend this book..just because it's british does not mean it's hysterically funny. 1 star."
5,Pixter Color Rom Pet Shop,"Awesome Product, love all the pixter products. I know my nephew will enjoy this for years."
4,good compatibility,"This product installed easily using Windows XP SP2 drivers. It worked well with USB devices that were previously problematic using the motherboard USB ports on an older Dell OptiPlex computer. Before installing this PCI card, a new laser printer attached to any motherboard port disabled the remaining USB ports for use with USB 2.0 devices. My only criticism of this card is the price. Many such PCI cards are available for 1/3 the price, but the Belkin card had a good record of device compatibility."
3,"It does the job, kinda","I have a Mac G4, and this card will work. However the first one I had was determined to be faulty (Belkin tech support surprised me by actually being helpful and knowledgeable), and I sent it back for a replacement. The second card works better, but I still have issues with it not always recognizing something plugged into it on startup.Amazon's packing of this item was sub-par. It was simply put into an anti-static bag, and put in the standard Amazon box, with an air packet tossed on top, this did nothing to prevent the card from rattling around in shipping."
4,pontiacs greatest decade,"I found this book alot more infroming than the pontiac""s 1946-63. but im stil have a missing link that I need to read .Safari""s of the 1960""s"
4,good slipper for a good price,pretty good fit and quality overall...my only complaint would be that i wish there was a little more padding under your feet in addition to the foam and the sole
5,My hubby loves them.,"My hubby loves them. They're too big for me, but when I slip into them, it feels like you're walking on memory foam."
4,DEARFOAMS MEN'S SLIPPERS,Purchased these for my husband for christmas. He has enjoyed them. Only downside he says is that he cant wear them outside. I explained to him thats why they are called HOUSE slippers.
3,Great Fit - but doesn't live up to the claims,"I bought these when they were less than $10...great deal...as mentioned in the other reviews...these fit snug, are soft and comfortable. Very low profile as if you just have a pair of socks on - a definite plus. However, the memory foam is relatively thin or the foam used is the cheaper lower density kind. Tried on the other ""as-seen-on-tv"" memory foam slippers and they use the more substantial ""NASA"" engineered foam. Now that the Dearfoams are back up around $18 a pair, I'm going to buy the ""as-seen-on-tv"" pair for the real memory foam experience (since my Dad appears to be using the Dearfoams as his own)."
3,Warm ad comfy adjusted. lowered rating,"Nice slippers. I have never been one to where them, still not in the habit but these feel real nice, soft and warm and they dont slip off like others i have tried in the past. Im glad I got them.Update: The heal is weak, the memory foam loses its effectiveness quickly. Not as good as I originally thought."
5,comfy slippers,These slippers are well-made and super-comfortable to wear. Good traction and soft material make these slippers a boon to aching feet. Definitely recommended.
2,Archos Jukebox Stereo Microphone,"I ordered this microphone to use with the Archos GMINI 400 and according to the Archos website, they are compatible. It's hard to believe the high quality GMINI 400 and this poorly made microphone carry the same brand. The output from the microphone preamp with a fresh battery and output levels all the way up is only adequate to pick up voice from a couple of feet away. The construction is flimsy plastic and its way over priced. I gave it two stars because there may be some devices that it works OK with. I very seldom have to return products but I am thankful for Amazon's excellent return policy."
1,"Noisy, unusable concert recording...I returned it","The recording that I got from this at a big outdoor concert was unfortunately unlistenable. I experimented with setting the input level to different settings, but anywhere I set it the input to my Archos AV400 was clipping. The price, integrated amplifier, and ability to easily hide it from the venue's pat-down goons were my reasons for trying it out, but I guess you get what you pay for. I haven't bought a replacement yet, but I've gotten some good recommendations for Sony's stereo microphone, although that one needs either an amplifier or plug-in-power. Save your money and pay a bit more for something that you'll be happy with after you make your recordings."
5,Superb Tiepin Microphone for Line-in levels,"I use this with a number of MP3 recorders and mixers to record presentations. Clipped to a suit lapel, or a tie, it has virtually no handling noise, yet a clean, multi-channel pseudo-stereo image. The amplifier can be used with other lapel microphones, too. I own several professional lapel microphones, yet find this is the most reliable at getting a good, clean recording."
5,This is TERRIBLE... I'll be buying a copy immediately,Manchild alone is worth the price of the CD. Her music is absolutely awful and brings a tear of joy to my eye. Good luck
2,"Nothing on Raw Like Sushi matches ""Buffalo Stance""","I just recently heard ""Buffalo Stance"" on my local college radio station, and it brought back memories of the first time I heard it in back in the winter of 1989. It isn't difficult to see why this song was so popular back then; it had all the infectious grooves an excellent pop song should have. But there's a problem with the overall album of Raw Like Sushi: all the songs that surround ""Buffalo Stance"" don't even come close to matching its catchiness. Even the inexplicably praised ""Manchild"" is dull.Find the single for ""Buffalo Stance"" if you can, and pick up a Salt & Pepper album as an alternative to Raw Like Sushi."
3,"The original ""spice girl"".","This debut of hers may not be as impressive now, but in 1988 it was ahead of its time, and great on many levels. ""Raw Like Sushi"" also covers as many genres as it does topics. I still have the cassingle of ""Buffalo Stance"", and that song remains the best thing on here. However ""Manchild"" and ""Kisses On The Wind"" are catchy too. In fact, the album starts out very strong, then becomes too similar in the second half. But overall it's a good listen from this ""Inna City Momma""."
