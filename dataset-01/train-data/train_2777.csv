5,Anime at its best!,"If your looking for the an amazing, action packed, and involving show; look no farther than Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood. This show is truly stunning on the Bluray format and belongs in any manga/anime lovers collection! Give it a chance, it just might surprise you!"
1,Im nogt gonna lie...,"I have yet to read a review I couldnt tear apart at how terrible brotherhood is compared to the original.Volume 3 just continues the trash.You'll love FMA Brotherhood if you want all of the character development to be replaced with bad anime humor and the storyline to be incredibly stupid oh and not to mention the science of alchemy turned into basically god mode or magic.This is not FMA, this is just bad.The best I can say is it is a marked improvement in the actual animation department but in all honesty the original wasnt that bad.I only suggest anime fans watch this because they are the only ones who could stomach it"
5,Fullmetal is back better than ever,"I have seen both seasons from start to finish (Inc Brotherhood)The 2nd version is by far a better scripted version it has alot more story too and the pace is much faster (2 Episodes per Novel seems right)Their have been some good (Evangelion) & BAD (Negima!?) remakes in the past but this is by the best and should be the bench mark for all others to come.In regards to IMPORT tho, I'm a REGION B buyer and unlike Part 1 & 2 Which were AB, it is now but just A, its kind of a double whammy since Manga here in the UK stopped making them after part 2 (30 each certainly didn't help matters)If you don't live in the US and want to import you will need a Region A Compatable PlayerThe best I can advise are (Japanese) 60GB PS3's with the UK AC & PC's with Blu Ray Drives (The 7 times rule will count here tho)But this is certainly worth owning for the 1080p quality etc"
1,Excellent,This flavor of tuna is to die for! I was informed about this just last week and thought I would give it a try and I love it. I just wish there were more crackers with it.You won't be disappointed!
5,Fun,Exactly what we needed for extra activities for busy preschoolers. I would definately buy them again. They were all working and have not had any problems with them.
2,Where can you find a durable bean bag?,"We use a lot of bean bags for games at our weekly Awana program. They are thrown, stepped on, and whacked against the ground a lot. These barely lasted a season. Not worth our money."
2,Not very versatile as bean bags go,These bean bags are probably okay as a toy but they will not be useful if you are looking for a bean bag to rest a camera on or if you are looking for a bean bag to use as any other kind of cushioning device (I was making a hat stand) these bean bags will not suffice. They don't have very much filling.
1,Disappointed,I was expecting bean bags. I got bags with a few beans in them. Essentially flat bags. Could use a lot more filler.
2,too cheap to be useful,"These were the least expensive set of bean bags I found. If I had seen them in a store there is no way I would have purchased them. They are made out of a stiff and flimsy fabric like paper (similar to what cheap reusable grocery bags are made of). They have only a few ""beans"" in them and are very light. I can't imagine any use you would have for bean bags that these would be good for."
2,Too wimpy for a bean bag,"I purchased these for a Harvest Fair game at our preschool. Three year-olds aren't too picky, but I wouldn't buy these again."
5,Ghostwriter WORD!,"A Blast From The Past! The '90's: When Educational Programming Was In Tune With The Audience & Was Cool. I Faintly Remember It At The Time It Originally Aired But I Watched It Religiously When It Aired On Noggin In The 00's. Even Kept A Casebook Too! The Packaging Design Is Bright & Vibrant & The Casebook That Is Included Inside Is A Nice Touch As Well. DVD Quality Is Great & The Menus Are Simple, But Still Great. Its A Great Purchase To Reveal A Great Program That Ended To Soon. Now If We Could On Get A Season 2 Set. Word!"
4,Good buy,"Although the DVDs were in great condition, I was surprised to find the case was not in the original wrapping. I would have preferred it to be, seeing as I was giving it as a gift."
5,Ghostwriter: Season One Review,"I have been looking for this for quite some time. This series still amuses me and recommend it to everyone. It can be corny at times, but still makes you want to see what happens."
3,"nice, but not totally up-to-date","im a hotel snob and do tons of travel, sometimes simply to go to a city for the hotel. while the book has some very useful and practical information, the hotel business changes as fast as the net. some very fine, very hip hotels have been missed. there should be, maybe a next edition, bigger sections or more books per city, assuming the city or region has enough. in any event, the pictures are great, the text is simple to follow and pretty accurate as to tyhe hotel and it's vibe. i'd give it 4.5 stars if it had more hotels."
5,"A travel companion, a style guide.","If you are going to Berlin, Paris or London, forget the boring hotels, follow the style of Hip Hotels"
3,bachelor party meets the Wake,It is strange that the stripper has so much disgust for the deceased. But the real question is how this can be considered academic.
2,It's too pricey for the entertainment value.,I got this as a gift for my little boy. The toy has held up but my children have more fun playing with the blocks rather than listening to music. I wouldn't recommend this because of the price. Also they always are taking out the cartridge and blocks so you can never find the pieces. It's a great idea but there are other toys that they play with and seem to enjoy more.
4,Expensive toy,"I bought this for my friend's 2 1/2 year old daughter. I also bought the Mary Poppins cartridge. She wanted nothing to do with Mozart after she heard Mary Poppins. I had high expectations that this would be the best gift ever, but after about 10 minutes, she moved on to playing the drums on an upside down tinkertoy case. What you need to know about this toy: Do not expect to be able to turn down the volume with the switch - my friend's daughter discovered the switch within 10 minutes and it was on 'loud' from then on. Also - I am a huge Mary Poppins fan, but I found the Mary Cartridge to be annoying. Stick with Mozart or some of the other offerings if you buy this."
5,Well-made and Wonderful.,"Hannah loves this toy. We bought it for the educational aspect, but I love this toy as well. The blocks, when placed in the order of the rainbow play one piece of mucsic. The child can then make their own music. They offer a high or low volume, as well as an earphone adapter. The company has several new cartridges avaliable to expand the set. These blocks can withstand anything. My daughter poured water into hers, and they are still working. A good toy for parents concerned about musical stimulation."
1,Too loud!,"The lowest volume setting on this toy is too loud even in the next room, and is painful to listen to up close -- which is where my son has to be to play with it.I am uncertain whether playing classical music for a toddler promotes brain development or even an appreciation for the music."
1,DO NOT BUY BREAKS INSTANTLY,"Great idea, but the toy IS NOT durable. After returning one toy for not working, another one has broken. What a disappointment!! And the customer service is non-existant and when it is, they are rude!!!! Someone let me know when the class-action lawsuit will occur."
3,sound bytes get old fast,"I really like the musical aspect of the toy, but I am frustrated by the soundbite quality of it. My child and I enjoy rearranging the blocks and taking turns imitating the sounds, but overall, you don't learn actual pieces of music, you learn 2 second bits. I feel is a disservice to my 3yr old's ability to take in larger amounts of info. The rhythims of the world is excellent, but again, too brief in segments. My child does play with it, but in a more pounding, cause-and-effect way- and for that I give it 5 stars for durability! I would not rely on this toy to jump start musical appreciation."
2,Overpriced and Not Durable,"I bought this toy for my son. It started to break within one week of playing with it. He prefers a drum and keyboard to this toy, although he will play with it for short periods of time. If you decide to buy it, be sure to buy the extra cartridges or else the tune will drive you crazy."
3,Neat Idea but not durable,We got this as a gift for our son Xmas 2002. He is not hard on toys at all and did play with it for a while but then we put it up on a shelf.(We rotate toys). Then when he asked to get it down and when he went to use it only 3 blocks played and the last did nothing. Wasn't the batteries I changed them 2 times. I put another cartridge in - Same thing. Once I thought I got it fixed- cleaned the blocks and it seemed ok. Must have been teasing me bc it started doing the same thing 15 min later. It now sits on our basement - ready to be thrown out I guess. I thought it was an awesome idea but needs to be reworked a bit- including the placement of the cartridge area as kids just want to pull them out when they are little.
5,Best Toy Under the Christmas Tree!,"I bought this toy for my son who is 2 years old for Christmas and I can't decide who likes it more, my husband and I or him! There are many different fun things to learn with this toy...different instruments, shapes, and moving your body to the beat. The sound is stereo-like and we are ordering the additional cartridges."
2,Didn't Hold Our Interest,"My daughter got this when she was almost 2 years old. Her grandmother thought it would be a perfect gift, as my daughter absolutely loves music. Now she's almost 3 and I'd have to put this into the ""not worth it"" category. She plays with it briefly on rare occasion but doesn't get much out of it. Her instruments (maracas, tambourine etc.) which she got the same Christmas have been used frequently since then, while this one spends almost all of its time untouched. Each cassette plays only the same 20 seconds or so of one song over and over, albeit in different order and with different instruments. Save yourself some money and buy a Mozart CD and a bunch of child-friendly instruments."
2,For infants and young toddlers??,"I know this toy is advertised for infants and young toddlers butfrom my experience, the blocks aren't used for anything other than throwing. This toy requires a child to place the blocks back into the slots in order for a music sequence to be played. In my opinion, that's pretty advanced for an infant! I'm really not quite sure how older children like this toy as my 2 year old has not played with it except to toss the blocks around (as I mentioned). It looks interesting but I am not sure it is targeted for the right age group."
5,music blocks are great,"Great toy. Sound quality is good, possibilities are endless for my 27 month old son. He dances to the tune, composes another ""song"", and carries it around like an oversized transister radio. He plays with it everyday, and I do not mind listening to it at all. The only problem is the fact that the cartridge could get lost easily."
5,Awesome toy for kids if they can get it away from the adults,This toy is fun and interesting for kids of all ages -- it's really a brilliant idea. I wish they had more cartridges available than the 3 I've seen.
3,Lots of fun-but company no longer exists,This was one of my favorite toys-but beware if you buy this I went through 3 of these- and the company no longer exists-so if there is a problem with it-you are out of luck
4,"Great in the beginning, then stopped working",I bought this 18 months ago for my 6 year old and 2 year old. They both loved it. I bought additional cartridges then it stopped working. We replaced the batteries twice and it still does not work. It was expensive for a toy that did not last very long.
2,Disappointed - given the price,"I bought this toy for my son's first birthday. He never became seriously interested in creating melodies - he thought it was more fun to stack the blocks. Also...after a very short time, the base stopped recognizing the second block location and would just skip over it. My son was not rough with the toy and I think it should have lasted longer."
4,"We like this toy, even though it doesn't always work!","We bought this for our two children last Christmas. The kids (ages 3 and 8) have returned to it again and again during the year, even with only one working cartridge. The Rhythms of the World cartridge, which we bought at the same time, stopped working within hours of its first use. I didn't observe any abuse beyond what you'd expect from active children. I also didn't notice any warnings that the cartridges needed to be treated with extreme care. Sometimes with the Mozart cartridge, the blocks don't play, or they get stuck. It's surprising, though -- the kids do still go to it often, even with the problems. I'm tempted to buy one of the new cartridges, but I'm worried it will be wasted $$. I can't tell if our problems are with the blocks, the cartridge, or the main unit. Considering the cost, I expected better durability."
1,What a Bore!,I can't believe that my friend recommended me to buy this expensive toy!!! There's so little entertainment value in this toy that both my 18 month old and 3 1/2 year old daughters play with it only for 1 minute and onto the next toy. They're both music lovers too! Don't waste your money!
1,Boring!,My little brother got this game for his birthday last month. He liked it on his birthday but hasn't used it since. My parents and I are glad because the music was boring and driving us crazy! I don't think he learned anything from it. The blocks still look like new. He would have liked a baseball glove better.
3,disappointed customer,"If you have an energetic child this is definately NOT the toy to buy! The boredom factor set in for my 3 year old son in less than a week! My son received this expensive toy as a gift. What a waste of money. The sound bites last for only a few seconds and after playing with it for a few days he was totally bored by it. It does not have much versatility even with the extra cassettes you can purchase, it basically still does the same thing. My son now uses the blocks to put in his construction trucks and haul around! Not what the gift giver of this toy probably envisioned! Save your money on this one."
1,pathetic toy,"This toy is not interesting to adults or children. The musical extracts are too short, so it is not even an appealing music box. The sound quality is not good enough to make the differences between the instruments interesting. It breaks all the time: the blocks seem to get stuck so that music won't play when you press the buttons. When I called the company to complain about it breaking down they said it was a common problem and recommended hitting it very hard to make it play! Do not waste your money."
5,As much for for adults as for children!,"This toy is great! My two-year-old will sit and play with the blocks for hours (well, not hours but longer than just about any other toy! ). He loves changing the order of the blocks and changing the instruments to make his own little compositions. The best part is that he's learning cause and effect and Mommy & Daddy love it too. Every night as he goes upstairs to bed, he plays a tune for the stairs.We've also purchased the Sounds of the Orchestra and Rhythms of the World cartridges and recommend both!"
5,exceptional for autisic non-verbal children,"My child who is autisic phyically 7yrs, but mentally only 24months, no language. He took to it and challanged himself. It rare I find a toy strong and he takes to."
1,Switcheroo!,"We were excited to see this product at such a discounted price and ordered two of them. However, after several attempts to find out where the separate orders were delivered to (Amazon said it was delivered to our doorstep on a particular set of dates but neither us nor our neighbors received them)two orders did finally get delivered. They was not a Marvel Refrigerator, rather plastic bumpers possibly for the 4 corners of the refrigerators?? There was no description with them and when we contacted the company directly and Amazon we could get no satisfaction. The company said they made a mistake in placing that item and its picture on the Amazon site but would not honor the price they advertised it at. We asked Amazon to advocate for us but they said their hands were tied!"
1,incomprehensively dull,"This is history written in the old style- a list of facts such as names, dates, locations with little attempt to bring it to life, or give it meaning. As an person of Irish descent, born in NJ, I had high hopes of learning something about the way my ancestors lived in NJ, and was very disappointed."
5,Good read if you're proud to be Irish....,"And better yet, Irish in New Jersey! Very interesting to learn about your heritage. Would also be perfect for history buffs, especially those interested in America's development."
4,A must read for nurses,"The book, Your Career in Nursing, is a wealth of information for new graduates, nurse educators, and the seasoned nurse. This book is a guide for developing a positive and rewarding future in nursing. Your Career in Nursing provides the new graduate with realistice guidelines for choosing which career path to take and gives them strategies to use when difficult situations occur.

5,Helpful,I Reccommend anyone taking a career in nursing to get this bookthe price is not bad and its very helpful
2,Boring robots,I love mecha animes! But this one was hard to watch. I couldn't stand the main kid. Heck I was liking the bad guys more then the good ones. When there's no action then its boring. Never watch this again.
5,Excellent elementary science experiments.,This book is the best I've seen for doing simple machine experiments at the elementary level. It is perfect for third and fourth grade science classrooms. The directions are simple to follow and the results of the experiments are easy to understand. The function of each simple machine was clear. Students are able to collect the materials from home and the experiments are designed for them to work together. An excellent teacher resource!
2,basic,"book length is short and simplistic in concepts. my fault -i should have looked closer at the cover, and noted the page count."
4,Pirates and Science -- a Dangerous Mix,"Belay your search for a salty tale and batten on to this slender tome! Creationists may want to avoid this book, as Charles Darwin is a central character. The Pirate Captain takes his descriptively named crew on a rousing adventure around the world and back to London, employing clever disguises and foiling the dastardly plans of the Bishop along the way. Black Bellamy confounds the Pirate Captain yet again, but as usual the dashing Pirate Captain has the word. Written in the best homage to Gilbert & Sullivan's ""The Pirates of Penzance"", this series continues to delight and titillate the salty senses of the sea-faring soul. Practice reading in an authentic pirate voice, and have some cured ham handy for snacking."
4,"a-r-r-g-h, maties!!",this book was given as a gift and the recipient loved it! She is eagerly waiting for the sequel.
2,"Been there, done that","Another in the series of misadventures and deadbeat characterizations. Stick with the FLASHMAN series, or anything by Swift, to see how this genre should be done."
2,talk about a stupid movie,"I Married Wyatt EarpI always loved marie, she was my role model growing up. whatever she did, i did, whatever she wore, i wore, so i thought anything she stars in has to be great. What a disappointment. she was way too big a star to settle for this ridiculous movie that made no sense. The title I married wyatt earp was a poor choice because it wasnt even about the marriage. didnt even have a wedding scene. the story line just jumped around all over the place and made no sense to me. It wasnt a believable story yet it was supposed to be based on a true story. Within 5 minutes of arriving in tombstone, your made to believe she just up and decides to abandon a musical career in a ladies opera group just because wyatt smiled at her and tipped his hat? come on. Marie fans, save your money. don't buy this movie unless your in to disappointment"
2,Story stops with Episode 18 - Last Disc is Just Filler,"This retrofuture military anime (an alternate Europe post-WWI 1920s) begins well with a Kaname Chidori-like strong female character commanding a group of military misfits in some interesting missions. They then stumble onto Hilary Clinton's ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" and the plot takes some FULL METAL ALCHEMIST type plot turns. By episode 18 it looks like this will really be a good anime. Then (apparently) the director decided not to complete the story and wait for a second season. The plot just stops and disc 4 contains 6 episodes of the longest, most drawn out, most boring ""boss battles"" (with a very minor boss) in living memory. What a waste!"
2,Turns into a tiresome diatribe at the end,"This series had a lot of potential but Gonzo throws it all away. The series *ends* with a story arc that just begins to get interesting. But, without enough time to wrap things up, the series ends with a long, boring, multi-episode, diatribe on class warfare. It's painfully obvious they dragged things out just to fill out the season. And because of all of the mistakes made along the way, the series didn't do well enough for a second season, so the interesting story arc is forever left unfinished. This series brought painful, repressed memories of Glass Fleet back to mind, especially near the end when the class warfare becomes more prominent. At least Pumpkin Scissors has it's moments, but any series that can be compared to Glass Fleet probably isn't worth watching. It's a real shame Gonzo didn't go with a tighter story arc and wrap things up in one season because that could have worked. What they did release doesn't work, especially at the end."
3,"Fun plot, poor dialogue","Based on the reviews I read of this book, I thought I'd really enjoy it. And if the dialogue hadn't been so awful, I probably would have. Thoughts that should have stayed in the characters' heads were spoken in torturous fashion, and the main character's British roommate sounded like she'd just fallen out of an episode of Upstairs, Downstairs. (And she couldn't get up, either.) Some lines sounded fine, but much of it just felt wooden and flat. I stayed with it until the end because I thought the premise was entertaining, and I wanted to see what happened. If I read another book by her, I'll probably pick it up from the library."
5,Great quality,"Received on time, and with no damages. Was easy to assemble. Parts sturdy and well made. My son has used it for 5 months now. No problems... great quality."
4,A NICE EDITION OF THE FABULOUS GOLDEN SHRINES OF TUT,"Nobody will deny that the golden shrines of Tutankhamun rank among the most wonderful items of his even more fabulous treasure. This complete and detailed edition of the decoration and texts of the same surely will remain as the necessary reference-book for anyone attempting a study of them. Authoritatively written and well-researched, I must recommend this title to everyone wishing to learn in depth about the religious mental-horizon of the ancient Egyptians. Buy it as soon as you can (and if you are lucky to find it)!"
1,tiny ugly,I agree they were tiny and ugly no reason to buy tiny and ugly cards with tiny words don't buy they suck
5,FAST SERVICE,Tried to order this item from another seller only to STILL be kept waiting. I decided to try my luck here and ordered this item on March 17th and received it the following day. The bubble wrap came in a easy to dispense box and is just as advertised. Super happy with the service! FAST!!! Me likey!
2,Fast deliver but flimsy product,"The product arrived very fast ,,,HOWEVER, if you are looking for a ""safe"" wrapping product for your valuables when packing,,,,this is NOT it. The bubbles popped when I was ripping it off of the roll, and again while I was wrapping it up around the item. The entire time I was using it,,pop, pop, pop,,,,those bubbles were popping faster than I could warp up the items. My advice is to go with a more reputable named product or do like I did, and order a smaller bubble size (I chose the 3/16 wrap). Just make sure that you get a roll that has perforated sheets."
4,"Very good, but .....","We bought this and were given the latest Frommer's guide, both to prepare for a cruise of French Polynesia. Found this book useful, but got more information from Frommer's."
5,A name you can trust,"My wife and I are frequent travelers to the South Pacific. Every time we have relied solely on Internet web sites, travel brochures and some travel handbooks we have been consistently disappointed in our accommodations. David Stanley's travel books have always steered us in the right directions. The new Tahiti handbook is full of clear maps, and pictures. This book is full of well researched practical information and advice. Most importantly it is information you can trust."
3,moon tahiti down loaded to kimble from amazon,WE are planning a trip overseas next year from Australia where we live. Since being a little girl I've always wanted to go to Tahiti and were looking at cruses that go there but since reading this book I no longer want to go there. This book tells it warts and all and this destination would not suite our disabilities.It was very detailed with walks etc. but we can;t walk very far so wasted on us.Wish authors would write some sections for the disabled as I find most travel books are sadly lacking this information.Think this book would be fine for the young and fit. Plenty of detail if you want to spend some time here.
2,updated when?,"Been using this guidebook and LP's for making reservations for my island-hopping September 2008 trip, and find the listed accommodation prices in the moon edition to be woefully out of date, even accounting for the change in exchange rates. How can the LP Tahiti book, which was released in 2006, have more up-to-date information? Incredible!Given this, I found it puzzling that so many previous people have rated this book so highly. When you look at their review histories, many are for books by this author. Hmmm."
4,Very cute - just wish they had a zipper!,"These are exactly what I was looking for... minus the zipper! This makes it a bit more difficult to lace up all the way and take the shoes off later. You'd have to undo them almost to the bottom... it's kind of annoying. Also the shoes feel big on me- there's extra space even if you get the right size... Nevertheless, I like the length and style of the boots."
1,Fame... what a stern mistress!,"Ms. Rappazzo meanders her way through eleven numbers --none of which is notable, let alone qualified to benumbered among today's ""standards""-- with a vocal uncertainty which leaves one wondering where (and even if)she squandered any money taking lessons. If there is anything on the album approaching a level of merit, itwould be the instrumental backing for her attempted vocalizing. It goes without saying --although in thisinstance it NEEDS to be said-- that in today's ""do-it-yourself"" music-producing marketplace just about anyonecan put out a product... then let the consumers decide if it's ""good."" AMERICAN IDOL may not be the end-allwhen it comes to evaluating product, but it sure saves interested persons time and money.***NOTE: I gave this CD one starbecause Carmela was braveenough to put it out herewhere it could be heard!"
1,Dissatisfied customer,"The item ordered (as presented by the vendor's description and picture) was NOT correct. I needed a Genie GR390-12 Garage Gate Receiver, which by definition is a 12 switch unit on a specified frequency. The unit shipped was a 9 switch model. On top of that, the unit,which measures approximately 2"" in thickness,was shipped in a box that measures 1 1/2 inches on the inside. The box therefore was bulged by the contents, and arrived completely demolished. The insult on top of the injury, was to pay MORE to return it (in a correctly sized box) than the original postage to get it here in the first place. Caveat emptor."
4,Very good guide,"I bought this for my wife who loves the game and just couldn't figure out some pieces of the game, like how to get to the two bottom worlds. After she got this she was able to get to them easily as well as find things out about the game she didn't know before. Very well designed and great pics of the levels."
1,Condition not as advertised,This item was listed as like new but should have been listed as good. The spine of the book was very worn and some of the first few pages look like they're about to fall out.
2,Disappointed - NOT 18/10,"We registered for these for our wedding to replace my old Ikea flatware set. I have a piece of (what I think is) the original version of this flatware by Ginkgo that I purchased open stock 15 years ago. I'd always loved the little swirl and was excited to select the new version as our everyday flatware. We received them today and I am sad to report that they are NOT 18/10 as stated by Amazon. They are 18/0, which is lesser quality, and they overall look cheap. We'll be returning them and looking for other flatware that is 18/10. Very disappointing. Also be advised that the hostess set and flatware set ship separately."
3,"Beautiful BUT DECEPTIVE DESCRIPTION, NOT 18/10!","Although my product was listed as in stock, part of it was not, and now I have to wait a month for remainder of my order. The in stock part was also shipped later than expected, and only after I reminded them they hadn't shipped it yet. The worse part though was this set is 18/0,and NOT the promised 18/10 stainless steel stated multiple times in this description I feel duped now!!! AND I'm still waiting for part of my order! Urrrghh!!!"
1,"Filled with lies, slander, and BS","After reading this book, I was utterly shocked at how anyone could write this tripe, let alone publish it. I cannot imagine anyone who reads this not feeling greatly insulted and ""taken"" by the author.This book makes a huge number of claims, and provides no evidence to support those claims. The book lacks any data that one can use to research the claims--- a deliberate deception.I spent a dollar on this book, and I feel like I have been cheated out of that dollar.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS ...! ..."
4,A Master of Film Noir,"This is a dissertation published as a book. It should be of interest to readers interested in film noir, as it has very detailed discussions of ""The Killers"" (1946) and ""Criss Cross"" (1949) as well as Siodmak's other Hollywood films noir.The book only examines Siodmak's films. The title, a play on ""The File on Thelma Jordan,"" the last of Siodmak's American films noir, sets up false expectations that the book will deal with Siodmak's private life, perhaps politics in that era of WWII and HUAC, but this is not the case. Still, the films get wonderful coverage, and this book should fight the tendency in recent years to overlook Siodmak's contribution to film noir."
2,"Fun toy, but defective","The concept of this toy is fantastic, but when we opened it one of the magnets was missing from one of the gears and it does not work without the magnet. It was a gift and by the time it was opened I could not return it :( I'd be happy if I could just get a replacement magnet."
2,A lot of fun for about 5 minutes.,"I don't understand all the great reviews. It's definitely great out of the box after five minutes, you find yourself looking at it saying ""ok- i see it and I get it- what's next""? You can shift around the pieces a few times, but then you are done. I have no clue how this can keep any kids attention for more than 5 minutes here and there."
5,"Fighting, fighting, fighting.","This toy is amazing. My two children fought over this thing the moment it came in the mail. No one in Hawaii sells this so I'm glad I could get it through the mail. It's amazing, and I love the fact that it's got moving parts and very easy for them to put together and take apart."
2,misled by previous reviews,"We purchased this toy for our children, ages 4 & 7, based on the glowing reviews. I must admit it's a clever concept. The kids we're having fun with it initially, but have not taken it out since the holidays. I think the most fun they had was putting small figures on the gears & watching them go around. This may be fine for the 3 and under crowd , but I would not recommend it for anyone older. Unfortunately, in this world of high tech stimulation, this toy is a one trick pony that will tire kids quickly."
3,great toy terrible service,For the price of this toy I expected the kind of service you get with other good quality toys. Not this one. I have tried to get help from Tomy and their website doesn't even acknowledge this toy as part of their line of toys. I tried e-mailing the company about a loud dying motor. No response after 3 tries.
1,Not bad for younger audiences,"Our daughter (age 2 1/2) plays with this toy every once in a while, but it has basically sat around since Christmas. Our 8 month old watches it intently, and frequently chews on the pieces, but there is very little interaction involved for either of them. The toy doesn't shut off by itself, and can be extremely grating if left on for extended periods of time."
5,Great toy for a mechanical kid,"This toy is great for my 2 year old. He loves to connect the gears and watch it go around. We searched all over locally for this and could only find it online, well worth paying the freight! It keeps him happy for a long time :)"
2,Not lasting fun,"There are lots of positivie reviews about this toy, which you can refer to hear all the good things this toy has to offer. Here are the I don't like about it:1. It's makes noise that is appealing to children but very annoying to the adults in our family.2. There is no place within the toy to store all the gears and pieces that come with it, so they end up easily separated and strewn around and lost easily.UPDATE: This toy lasted two and a half months before the motor that turns the gears broke and the toy stopped working for good."
4,The Favorite Toy!,"We received this as a gift when my son was 3, he LOVED it. He took it to preschool for show and tell and all the kids wanted one.The gears are really easy to move and manipulate. My son loved the fact that you can change directions or make it go faster/slower. He would rearrange the gears and then sit and just watch them.It is great for spatial skills, you have to be able to line up the gears with the opposing gears to make them connect and spin. It allows you the opportunity to discuss magnetics as well.Great toy! It fell out of favor around age 5 though (thankfully his 2yo old sister now enjoys it). So I would say it is best for ages almost 3-5."
3,Meredith Braun Rocks!,"Les Miz is my absolute favorite show and Meredith Braun, hands down, sings THE BEST rendition of ""On My Own."" The only problem, if at all, is that she follows the melody of the music too perfectly. But just listen to her voice as she goes into her full belt. ""The world that's full of happiness that I have never KNOOOOOWWWN! "" She has the childlike quality that the original, Frances Ruffele, had but it's more controlled and not as whiny, and she definitely has the power of Lea Solonga but with more pain and longing than anger. I would definitely recommend this CD just for ""On My Own"", although the rest of the CD isn't bad at all. Ofcourse Philip Quast sings the best rendition of ""Stars"" ever but you can hear that on the other CD's. And at this great price you need to add this to your collection, especially if you're a big fan!"
2,DON' T BUY IT!,"Don't buy it. There's no point to get this CD except if you want to hear Philip Quast singing ""Stars"". But then you might as well get the 10 years Anniversary Cast Recording, 'cause Mr. Quast was in it as well. I've never heard such an aweful Eponine before, and Empty Chair at Empty Table, was that guy in a hurry to go somewhere? I had a feeling he was just rushing through the song. Even it's only 8$, it's not worth it. I don't understand why they even bother to made this CD anyway?"
3,Good not excellent,"This is a solid book that covers some of the topics quite well. I would give it a higher mark had I not being reading, at the same time, another book on the topic, Prepare for the Worst, Plan for the Best: Disaster Preparedness and Recovery for Small Businesses, by D. Childs."
2,Cheap - But not a bargain,"If all you want is a an In-Dash CD Play, it's fine. You can only access the clock when the unit is powered up - and then by pushing a button.After about 6 months, the rotary tunur (Note - no pushbuttons on this unit) only works after the car has been sitting in the sun for a few hours, otherwise you cannot change the station.The tuner also has a tendency to wander, so if you want a good signal (when the knob is indeed working) you have to periodically fiddle with it."
4,"So when will the ""Hagan Strikes Again!"" books be reissued??","I've always loved Kay Hooper's way with her characters, and these early books were a wonderful reminder of just how good Kay can be WITHOUT a crime to be solved! Now if Bantam will just reissue omnibus editions of all her 'Hagan' Loveswept titles, I'll be a happy, happy Hooper fan!"
5,One popsicle please!,"Don't miss this red hot title! But I'd recomend reading it with oven mitts so you don't burn your hands! Oooh! And sunglasses! And beer! He's no Yolanda Celbridge, but then, who is?!Joking aside, this guy kicks a$$."
3,Good product,"Is a good product, nothing very special but is very helpful to reminder to change the water(I have salt one)... it sounds a loud beep. Of course that have more reminder, but the water change is essential :)"
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,I installed this on my 2008 Town and Country for the heater hoses and 2 months later it cracked and tore like paper. CHEAP! Dont buy it!
1,where has the italian language ended?,"I RECEIVED THIS COLLECTION AND I RETURNED IT IMMEDIATELY BACK TO AMAZON. WHY? BECAUSE I ORDERED IT AS STATED IN THE AMAZON SITE, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF HEARING THE VARIOUS FILMS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, AMONG WHICH MY OWN, OF COURSE,THAT IS THE ITALIAN ONE. NOT ONE OF THE DISCS HAD THE ITALIAN DUBBING, SOME SPANISH SOME FRENCH, BUT NO ITALIAN. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE THAT FOX MAY REPLY TO MY QUESTION? OR SOME AMAZON CUSTOMERS MAY CLARIFY THIS TO ME? AMAZON SEEMS UNABLE TO REPLACE THE SET, THEY WANT TO REFUND BUT NO REPLACEMENT. WHY? THIS IS INTOLERABLE. I DO CARE FOR THESE FILMS. PLEASE, AMAZON FRIENDS, IF YOU READ THIS WOULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME A CLARIFYING E-MAIL AT zeller@alice.it' MY NAME ISERNESTO OPPICELLIVIA CERTOSA 1A-316159 GENOVA CERTOSA - ITALY (PHONE 010/468779)THANKS FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART."
1,17 noirs for 800 dollars?!,"Math is not my best skill admittedly, but 800 dollars does seem a little much for 17 films noir. Isn't that more than 40 dollars a film?"
3,Don't Forget This One Too.........,"For some reason the Fox Noir release Dark Corner (Mark Stevens, Lucille Ball, Clifton Webb, William Bendix) doesn't get much coverage under the typical outlets for obtaining these Fox Noir titles, Amazon included. I didn't even know the title was even out there, but it is, and it is quite a Noir gem. I say this without hesitation because I was never a Lucy fan at all. But in this one, she's actually pretty cool. Too bad she went goofy in later life (I guess it paid the bills).If you like the Fox Noir series and Noir in general, don't forget this one too. I got mine from Tower Records (seems hard to find for some reason). The famous ""peering through the venetian blinds"" scene that you see stills of all the time, that's Mark Stevens. A somewhat overlooked actor in Noir circuit, but he can hold up to any of the other more noted ones in my opinion. Check it out."
5,"Depends on the price,I think",I picked up this set for $123.00 and I've noticed they've now raised the price to over $200.00.It's worth what I paid for it.
5,A fabulous journal,"This is a perfect place to record special events and gatherings. I record not only group parties but also special occassions when just a couple of friends come over. Susan's art graces every page. The book is divided into the four seasons, winter, spring, summer and fall. A great gift."
5,Enjoyable book while you learn proper meanings,"What I found interesting about this book is knowing how Kanji characters were made. I was unaware of the origins of some characters even though I am a native Japanese. It was an enjoyable book while offering proper meanings, pronounciation, and origins."
5,A real singer!,"Devìa has a clear, ringing, forward, very Italian-sounding voice, which she uses with great command and self-assurance. Just to hear her nail all those high notes with such complete aplomb is quite impressive, and her sustained phrasing and breathing clearly denote a very well-trained singer. She is also a fine musician: her intonation is at all times sure, a critical fact with so clear a voice, and she understands the shape and balance of a musical phrase. Very impressive.As an interpreter, she is quite restrained; not for her the five-course meals that some operatic ""tragédiennes"" like to make out of every phrase. She has a Latin's natural, unforced emotion, but does not resort to heavy-breathing neurotics.It is also very refreshing to hear Italian so beautifully and naturally ennunciated.Devìa is a complete and very sincere artist, and this disk is a joy."
2,A Glorified Day Planner,"I wouldn't recommend buying this ""book"" because it's little more than a pretty, wedding themed day planner. The planner is split into 16 different sections. Each section features a blank month-at-a-glance calendar, blank weekly pages, a blank to-do list and a blank page for notes. The book also includes a place for you to record contact information for your guests, wedding party and vendors. It's a royal pain to go through the pages of this book and fill in the dates, and there are no guidelines for what to complete when, how to schedule events, etc."
3,Rats don't use,"I would imagine that this is a very good product, I have just seen very little use of it from my pet rats."
1,Misleading....,"These high corner litter pans do not say they are MINI high corner pans...I was not inpressed, if I knew they were MINI I would not have ordered them...you need to include this in the name of the product!!!"
1,not compatible,The Ultalast Nikon EN-EL7 Equivalent Digital Battery UL-ENEL7 would not work in my cool pics 8400 camera and would not fit properly in the charger. had to send them back. Ed Ryerson
2,"Company seemed fair, but battery didn't work","The first battery I got was ""bloated"" and would not fit in my camera. The company quickly sent out another, but that failed to take charge. I have no problem with the customer service they took both returns without argument, but I wish one of the batteries would have worked properly instead."
4,A must for Crocodile lovers!!,"We own 4 of the Animal Planet Rescue sets and they are all amazing! The realistic looking animals with moving body parts and/or opening and closing mouths make them extra fun for kids. The best part is that unlike other sets where I have to sift through the small pieces and take out the guns and other weapons I don't let my kids have, you won't have to with these sets. The only shooting of the animals that will be done is with the video and still picture toy cameras that come in the sets."
3,Good fit but pricey.,Happy with the bra but felt it was too expensive. Other bras are just as good for much less.
4,almost as good as Maidenform,"I tried this bra based on other reviews I read here from women who had had the Maidenform bra that Maidenform seems not to make anymore ( which fit me about as perfectly as possible). This CK one is almost as good. The cups are molded just a bit differently so they come a bit higher and toward the center more for me, which is not as good a fit. The bra might fit someone else better just depending on shape."
5,An essential reading,"It is not only extremely informative about relevant facts of Christian history, but about the history of civilization as well. And it is not easy to find so much information well organized in a compact book."
2,Too broad to take too seriously...,"For 177 pages the author only provides 8 endnotes. With that said, it is understandably frustrating to read some rather sensational quotes that are then not cited. This is poor work.I usually enjoy Sophia Press works and I appreciate Moczar's love of the Church but this work is not one I find worthwhile to read."
4,Wondeful Easter Bunny Story,"This book is a wonderful story about different easter baskets and how the Easter bunny helps return 2 bunnies back to their basket. My daughter loves this book and we have read it so many times, the pages are falling out and we are ordering a second copy. She enjoys adding the sticker pictures too."
3,wrong size,"The item never fit my goldwing, well I guess I will just have to deal with it, should of went to the dealer"
5,A must have book for pet owners!,"This book is a must have! I learned more about my cats in Lila's book than I did in all my years living with them. Her approach to explaining remedies that will help our pets is done in such a loving manner. Even if you don't have a pet now, this book will guide you in being a responsible pet owner when you do adopt a pet. I have found her remedies and flower/fruit essences to be very helpful in managing the health of my cats. The advice works!!"
1,Worthless book; not helpful; gets 0 stars,"I love books, but this one I may burn as kindling. I own a bunch of flower essence books, including several flower essences + animals. I've owned this book for years and it was a waste of money. Not helpful AT ALL! Full of fluff. Don't pay more than $5. One star is too many, but Amazon won't let a person choose 0 stars."
2,iffy service and quality,"when i first ordered this product, i was sent an entirely different product (finger cymbals, for what it's worth). upon contacting customer service, which was very polite, i was, soon, sent the ocarina. unfortunately, the ocarina was out of tune (and one can't really re-tune an ocarina). upon again contacting customer service (significantly less polite, on this occasion), i was told that i'd have to ship back the ocarina, at my expense, which, considering the mistakes already made, i thought unreasonable. two stars for the original round of friendliness, but i shan't do business with this vendor again."
5,Great Toddler Tent,"After searching far and wide for the perfect tent, I purchased this from Amazon for my 18 month old son. He loves it!!! We set it up in his room on rainy days and he crawls in and out of the tunnel over and over again. It is durable and can withstand the rough and tumble play of a toddler. It is also big enough for parents to crawl inside and for your little one to stand up in. The tunnel detaches and folds easily for storage when he becomes tired of it. The trucks, buses, airplanes and cars on the tent gives him the opportunity to learn his vehicles...which every boy loves! Overall, this is a smart buy and the tent can be used indoors or out."
5,Fun,I have a 19 month old son who loves his new tent and tunnel. I do not let him play in it unattended since it is recommended for 3+. I bought this on summer clearance at Target for $20. I thought it was a great deal since it came with a tunnel too. It was easy to put together and easy to take apart. Even I can sit in the tent with my son and read a book with him. We also play hide n seek the tunnel. We have only had this toy for a couple of days but so far it has held up really well to a busy boy. I also love the design and the travel icons in different languages.
4,For a 15 month old..,"My 15 month old son loves it. He spends all kinds running in and out of the tent and the tunnel. So far, no breaks rips or tears despite lots of use. Quality product."
2,A terrible pain,This keyboard does not work with the latest smart cards. Look up a compatibility matrix before you buy any smartcard reader.
2,Poor Adaptation,"This is a poor adaptation of a classic children's book, and it's disappointing since a great lesson could have been learned by watching it if it were done better. Instead, they made the engine disobedient and only out for her own interests. She pulls the train because she has something to prove and not out of kindness. They also add a part about a storm and scary mountain that my kids find disturbing. This isn't the version I saw on TV as a kid, which is what I was actually looking for."
5,Cute Movie,"I got this for my 4 year old son, who loves trains. His preschool teacher read the book and showed this movie to the class and he had to have it! I lucked up and found it here on amazon for such a great price. The seller was very honest and the movie is in perfect playing condition. Still going strong! Very satisfied overall. My little boy is too!"
4,Don't expect the book Do expect fun,"My 3 year old loves the video and doesn't seem to mind it isn't the same as his story book. His die hard Mom wishes more of the original story was evident. Some of the embellishments seem unnecessary and harsh like the signal's attitude toward Tillie and the argumentative chicken. I am most disappointed that the helpful clown was turned into a buffoon. A lot of the characters changed and are hard to identify. I do like the Doc who helps Georgia. All that said it is a fun tape and your child will enjoy it. I did have to assure my son that the scary face was just snow that was falling down not a monster,"
4,Fabulous,"My 2 year old son loves this movie. We watch it every morning and then again before dinner. We have only had it for 2 weeks and he has learned so much from it. He sings with the songs, names animals, and talks about the train engines. It is a must have and teaches a valuable concept."
5,sentimental,I remember going to Blockbuster and renting this video every time we went. I also remember one time trying to stick blue bubblegum to the case so I could keep it. But I decided to buy it instead. Now I don't have to put gum on it in order to keep it.
5,My kindergarten students love it.,"Year after year I have been reading this story to my students, and they love it each time. Some of them have the book at home, and yet they love listening to it in class. I usually read it on the same week they get to make their own Shabbat boxes."
4,nice story,"This is a nice story for classrooms or homes about a shabbat box that gets lost. about fixing the problem with your own resources and finally about shabbat, and all it takes to make it special."
3,Argentine soldiers in the war,"Professor De Marco is a dedicated researcher, who has gone through a lot of documents to write this book. To a specialist, it can be a treasure throve of details and unknown info. If what you want is a general picture of the Paraguay War (and that is what you would expect from the title) you are in the wrong place. De Marco gives an accurate account of how the argentine army was organized, where the recruits came from, how they dressed, which weapons they had, how the medics were organized etc. But if you want to know what the war was about and what happened in it, you'll have to look elsewhere."
1,Never see this mediocre movie,"Super bad cheap movie, ugly, it is not what you think! No worthy. The cover is just a trick.Waste of time, outdated movie, trashy performance."
4,Silly 80;s kinda flick,"A movie written by a male director of course...has its moments to showcase just that. The POV of a male perspective when faced with the many facets of life when contemplating to cheat on his parter, a female none the less.Well edited and doesn;t drag like a Tarrentino flick and gets to the point for what its worth. I don;t know why the asking price for the movie is low, it should be more. It was a fun filled Friday night, why won;t I get laid if my conscience follows me everywhere kind of movie (the guilt).**My absolute favorite scene is the girls and drugs. That is all I have to say.Thomas A. Berg steals most of the scenes as well being a numb nut but my heart goes out to poor Benjamin M. whom has wayyyyy to many issues with women.******"
1,Be Aware!,"Please save your money and time and your energy, do not buy it if you're looking for an easy to navigate mp3 player! You won't know how to make this thing work! The manual is useless all of its sentences are not 'English', it's some type of mechanical translation from chinese I think so it doesn't make sense at all! I thought I'd return it, then I tried harder (till 4 am!) to figure out how it works. I've been using it moderately for 3 days now, it seems fine but difficult to navigate and battery life is rather low. If the video feature is not that important to you don't bother buying it because it's THE main addition compared to the other players (apple ipod nano)."
1,Songs are shortened,"This is a cheaply recorded compilation from Mardi Gras Records. The music is almost uniformly excellent. The second song, Do You Know What it Means to Miss New Orleans, is also featured in the ninth song, a medley. My main complaint is the editing. The first song (42 seconds long) is merely the end of a longer song and some of the other songs, although essentially complete, start or end too abruptly as though to hide the fact that some of the songs were recorded live. There are no liner notes."
3,"A good starter, but that's it","I think this book gets you thru the basics pretty nicely, but, as things start to get harder, the book isn't as useful.At one point you are advised something like this: ""from this point out we aren't going to advise you when to play chords or single notes, just go with what sounds good"". Great for the musically creative, but not me.The section on reading music doesn't clearly show you what notes go with what holes, is another example. And the section on playing blues was odd, not even explaining how 12-bar blues really works."
5,question? which harp picture is on the frnt cover? is it Suzuki?,which harp is on the cover? is it Suzuki or some other harp? at the moment I have nothing to add.Eo Vaher
4,HARMONICA BOOK,OK book. Its a bit DETAILED for beginners. But great if you are patient in committing your time to learn.
5,A really smart choice.,"This product with the book and the cd are a very welcome addition to my library.I have found the materials to be presented in a easy to read, and logical order thathas really helped my playing.I have been playing for over a year, but the wealth of info in the book, and actually being able tohear with the cd what the exercises should sound like has sped up my progress greatly.I would recommend this item to anyone who wants to learn to play the harmonica and has thediscipline to follow the steps in the book.I recommend buying a good harmonica at the start so your progress will not be frustrated bya cheap harps inability to perform for you.Hohner Special Twenty Harmonica, Key of C"
4,Easy to read and a great starter book,"Having never played harmonica before, this book is a very good introduction. The book reviews history, care and cleaning, selection of your harp, tabulature, bending notes, and of course the music. It is easy to read and well layed out. There are a number of traditional songs to play and a good section on the blues with a number of blues riffs to learn. The book comes with a CD, which is covers the songs that are in the book. The CD is very helpful and allows the student to get a better sense of timing and intonation. I wish there was a larger section on blues techniques, but my suggestion is to pick up one or more CDs of blues harmonica music and spend some time trying to duplicate the easier riffs on those CDs."
4,Thorough Guide to the Harmonica,"The Complete Idiot's Guide is a very thorough manual to learning the harmonica, including music theory, history, and physiology. For those analytical minds who love to know EVERYTHING about a subject, this is your book. It's well written and educational. From what I can tell, it covers every possible aspect of learning to play the harmonica, including how to read music, advanced techniques of play (such as bending), how to translate written music to a harmonica, and how to incorporate harmonica into a band or group.However, if you're a beginner ready to pick up a harmonica and a book to play today, I recommend David Harp's Instant Blues Harmonica. Pop that CD in, and you'll be playing in minutes. Literally! It quickly and easily teaches you the basics of harmonica improvisation."
4,a lt of info.,"a lot of info to read havent read it all yet but seems to be very helpful. can,t give an accurate review at this time.."
4,In good shape :),"Thanks to Amazon.com for this neat service. I got the book not only on time, but even before. I didn't have the time to read the book yet, but I had a chance to take a quick look at it and skim it here and there.It seems to be really interesting since I'm new to the harmonica world.Moe"
2,ITS NOT THE ORIGINAL WALK THE LINE ALBUM,THE ONLY REASON IM GIVE THIS TO 2 STARS IS THAT THE PRICE IS RIGHT BUT THE POOR SOUND QUALITY MAKES IT SOUNDS LIKE IS FROM A TAPE OR RECORD. IF YOU CAN AFFORD A BETTER ALBUM THE SUN YEARS IS ALL ORIGINAL RECORDINGS AND ARE SUPER CLEAR. THE SUN YEARS ALBUM GIVE YOU 18 SONG VERSES 10 SONG ON WALK THE LINE ALBUM. I ALSO RECOMMEND COUNTRY CASH ALBUM.
1,False Identity,This Is Not The I Walk The Line Album We Johnny Cash Fans All Know And I Think Since The Movie Is Now Out The Original I Walk The Line Album Should Be Bought Back In New CD Form So We Fans Can All Enjoy The Real Johnny Cash I Walk The Line Album It Is Excellent And This Needs To Be Taken Into Sincere Consideration.
3,The first 2 seasons are better.,"This is a cute series. The princess and the main character have a sweet relationship. The supporting characters are a lot of fun as well. The first 2 seasons were way better though. The title is also misleading. Seasons 3 and 4 only total about 8 episodes. I was disappointed by the length of the DVD set, but the story continued to be interesting. If you like the first 2 seasons go ahead and get this collection, but its too short."
4,UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie Season 3 & 4 review,"Continues from seasons 1 & 2, same good quality,enjoyable, would like to see a season 4 & 5. Ending just leaves it hanging."
4,Classic and classy,"This Hamilton has a timeless, classic look. While the leather band is first rate, the clasp can be difficult to use. I've had the clasp spring replaced once and I don't wear the watch all that often; maybe 2-3 times per month. But that is a minor quibble in a timepiece as beautiful as the Jazzmaster PVD40. An added bonus is the see-through case back to view the Swiss automatic movement. This watch is a very fine value for an automatic. It is accurate and precise. I love this watch and enjoy it very much."
1,Razor SP X20-inch Freestyle Bike,"The brakes on it are horrible. They will not work. Even after adjusting the brakes, they still did not work. This item is not worth the time and effort."
3,Expensive and uneven,"THE GOOD NEWS: THE MUSIC IS LOVELY, THE SOUND IS CLEAR, THE CHORUSES STRONG, THE CONDUCTING BRISK. THIS 2 CD RECORDING CONTAINS MASCAGNI WORKS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED PREVIOUSLY, AS FAR AS I KNOW. AMONG THEM THE LOVELY ""APOTEOSIS DELLA CIGOGNA, AND TWO COMPLETE OPERAS, SUNG BY LOCALS. ANTONIO DI PALMA BRINGS CLASS TO ""PINOTTA""--HE HAS ALSO RECORDED ITS EARLIER VERSION, ""IN FILANDA"". ""ZANETTO"" IS BROUGHT TO LIFE BY RITA LANTIERI AND AMBRA VESPASIANI. BUT A HORRIBLE SOUND IS HEARD BOTH IN ""PINOTTA"" AND THE LEOPARDI SYMPHONIC POEM: GLORIA GUIDA BORRELLI, WHOOTING AND WHEEZING LIKE A TERMINALLY EMPHYSEMIC MAMMA LUCIA. REALLY, AN INJUSTICE TO THE COMPOSER AND THE OTHER PERFORMERS. BECAUSE OF HER THIS RECORD DOES NOT RATE HIGHER. SEARCH UNTIL YOU FIND IT CHEAPER. THANKS TO OUR DISASTROUS ECONOMY, WE ARE BEING HIT BOTH IN THE EAR AND IN THE POCKET BY THESE EXPENSIVE IMPORTS."
4,Reliable,"This drive has been used in a computer store for 2+ years and is still going strong. Have not used it in a while but I bet if I pulled it out it would work just fine, reliable. Shame there is no DVD."
5,Not just for gamers!,"I've never RPG'd in my life, but this book was a must-have for the groovalicious art. As a bonus, there are clear and simple descriptions of various manga and anime subgenres, and an excellent beginner's list of videos available in the US."
2,Average quality LED,"This multi-function light is of average quality. LED is not that bright as I expected. Very flimsy, the lense comes out if you drop it once. But the black matte finish looks kewl. The torch facility was ok, was useful during one hiking and died after the first fall. Can recommend only for rare use - or as a part of your travel kit."
3,No online forms for kindle version?,I purchased the kindle edition but there are no access codes to print the online forms. This could be a very valuable book if I could print the forms. I am trying to figure out how to contact publisher. The kindle version should be fixed or else removed since it is useless without the access code for online forms.
3,Senior advice,"This was too much trouble. We were actually almost finished with most of our end-of-life planning, so this wasn't much help to us."
5,Smooth As Silk,"Having been a guitarist for over 40 years, I know when I hear greatness. This is greatness. I played in a bandfor several years, wrote music, studied music and appreciate great talent. From the opening bars of My ShiningHour you know that you are in for a great treat. This guy can play. The sound that he delivers is pure silk. Heexcells on the following tracks, My Shining Hour, All Too Soon, Isn't It A Pity, Soul Eyes, and E is fo Emment.His rich style of play coupled with his unique phrasing establishes this CD as one of the best Smooth JazzCDs on the market. He is only accompanied by hinself, yet the music is full and rich. You only need his guitar.If you enjoy outstanding ,smooth ,and easy jazz guitar, then this is the CD for you. It truly deserves 5 stars.It is as smooth as silk."
3,fine recording,"The 1984 West End production of the classic SINGIN' IN THE RAIN was a very successful revival of a classic film which translated perfectly to the stage, and heading the cast was veteran musical performer Tommy Steele as Don Lockwood. It played at the London Palladium to packed houses.The cast also featured Roy Castle as Cosmo Brown, Danielle Carson as Kathy Seldon and Sarah Payne as Lina Lamont. A fantastic ensemble was headed by Joyce Carpenter.Danielle Carson brings the house down with the 'Valentine Girls' in ""I Can't Give You Anything But Love"", which replaced ""All I Do Is Dream Of You"". Ms Carson also gives a lovely treatment of ""Would You?"".Tommy Steele proves his showmanship with ""You Are My Lucky Star"", ""Singin' In The Rain"", and ""Fascinating Rhythm"". Roy Castle is great in the comical ""Make 'Em Laugh"", while Sarah Payne is given time to shine in ""Temptation"".Overall a fine recording."
3,"Leave it to the Yanks, please....","I've heard two London recordings of the classic Singin' in the Rain, and I have to say that they just don't translate well. In my opinion Gene Kelley made the recording and the movie. It's a musical about the Golden age of Hollywood, it just doesn't have anything outstandingly British about it. The actors give terrible American accents, and Make Em Laugh made me weep. It just isn't worth the money, kids. Stick to the OBCR."
2,August P Derlethcraft,"Actually, this volume consists of HPL pastiches by August Derleth, presented as posthumus completions of unfinished stories or based on notes made by Lovecraft while he was alive. In reality, Derleth would often take as little as a single isolated sentance from Lovecraft's notebooks and spin a tale around it. Derleth handles the Mythos shoddily, making the tales far more repetitive, predictable and inanely cross-referential than Lovecraft would have, and without the fine (if often overblown) melodramatic flourishes that marked Lovecraft's style.Derleth is only ever half good when describing scenery - at which he excels Lovecraft. Otherwise, it's a lukewarm volume of Lovecraft Lite, and only one for the confirmed fan - newcomers should look to the Penguin editions, edited by ST Joshi for a more authentic entry to Lovecraft's work."
3,Not what I expected,"These are just a couple of flat backed magnets, not dinosaur figures. Maybe I misread the information, but I was disappointed. This is the first and last item I have purchased without an available picture to shot the product."
1,Definitely unusable,"I have to agree with Laura. I purchased several books in preparation to the Colorado San Juans and this was far and away the worst field guide I have ever bought. The few genera and species that are pictured and described are OK, but how do you do justice to the entire mustard family by including only 3 genera? The key is a joke for us casual enthusiasts.Peterson field guides can be excellent - I love my Southwestern and Texas Wildflower Guide, although it too needs updating of botanical names."
4,A botanical travelling companion,The photography is excellent. The line drawings are even more detailed. The descriptions are very useful. The interesting facts are often fascinating. I expect to field test this guide in July when I visit Alaska and British Columbia this summer. That will be the real test.
5,Dating Book for Real People,"This book was excellent. It doesn't talk down to singles, and it provides suggestions that are easy to use and extremely practical. Most dating books tell you to do things that are extremely silly, stuff you would never do for fear of seeming stupid. But this book is great in that it makes you look cool while you're trying to ask someone on a date or when you're on a date. Good advice for real people."
1,Prooganda,This book advertised itself as having important scientific information about a subject I was interested in. It was actually a kind of biographical journey that was trying to to use information that would convert me to a Christian Creationist view point. It was readable and friendly - kind of like the Simpson's born again neighbor. There was something -one fact- that may be significant but it could have been shared in a short paper. This book was a waste of money.
1,"All Pseudo, no Science...",Wow. What a load. Read it as a novel or Alternative History speculation.Save your money.Ugh...
1,Caveat Emptor,"If you are prepared to believe that God created the earth only a few thousand years ago; that the story of Noah and the flood is not a biblical folk tale but verifiable history; that Homo neanderthalensis is not a separate species but was invented by ""evolutionist"" scientists as part of a world-wide, century-old, anti-Christian conspiracy; that opponents of creationism have stalked the author around Europe with nefarious intent - then this is the book for you.If you're looking for a sober, scientific treatise on Neanderthals, look elsewhere. This is neither scientific nor very sober.But it's an amazing book, in the way that von Daniken's books are: amazing that an educated man can believe and write such garbage.This good doctor makes an unwitting case for the theory of the development of modular intelligences and against evolution: His common sense module clearly failed to evolve. This is sad and rather scary stuff."
1,Do not waste your time,"Badly written, badly editted, completely devoid of logic. The author never manages to state outright his position but spends a lot of words on spiteful ""digs"" at scientists who follow the classic evolutionary path, whilst attempting to include a ""folksy"" attitude. He does not provide any factual rebuttals of evolutionary theory; only hints and ""my opinions"". Very disappointing as he has done a disservice to alternative therories regarding Neandertal man, and also I feel, to the study of Biblical Interpretation.It is not easy to read; it does not appear to have any structure to his premise.Altogether, highly UNRecomended."
1,Conspiracy theory meets Creationism,"This book is filled with logical fallacies, unsupported assertions and some typical rehashed Creationist falsehoods. The innovative theme of the book is that there is now an international cadre of Evil Evolutionists out to get those who do not believe in the Sacred Dogma of Darwin.Spurious and laughable, this book should be consigned to the depths of Creationist literature. The author never explains how he knows that Neanderthals are the equivalent of 600 year old humans. Where did he find a 600 year old human to compare it with, I wonder?"
1,Please do,"Buried alive, and rightly so. If you want to know about neanderthal man, don't look here. Anything discovered or known about neanderthal man has been twisted and replaced with nonsense to fit Cuozzo's agenda, and create controversy. There is a strong paranoia of evolution. Nothing is said that can be supported by a reasonable mind."
1,This book appears to be the grand scientific forgery.,I did not find any single real scientific evidence supporting the writer's point. If the author's speculations were correct he would be recognized and supported by open mind public and by the majority of experts. It can never happen.
5,Buried Alive---The True Story of Neaderthal Man,"It doesn't matter which side of the fence you're on. EVERYONE needs to read this book, and with an open mind. I was shocked when I read Dr. Cuozzo's eyewitness account of a scientist (?) altering a skull so it's appearance would seem to support evolutionary theory. His diagrams and discourse are both educational and interesting. He does get technical at times, by necessity, but staying with him yields it's own rewards. If you have any interest in the evolution/creation controversy, especially if you're an educator at any level, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK ! If you believe in the theory of evolution I DARE YOU to read this book with an open mind and then see if you can ever look at the theory of evolution the same way again."
3,Not Exactly,"I am a man that has problems with my hands or fingers that are dry and they crackopen and hurt.I thought this would help my problem but it's not quite what I expected.Even though this product does help some,so does plan ole Vasoline thatkeeps my skin on my hands soft and much cheeper,So try a little vasoline on yourfingers and rub it in a few minutes,Works for meGood Luck--Jim"
2,I hope it works....,"I bought this cream because of the rave reviews and because I suffer from dry, cracked fingertips every winter. I hoped this would be the solution. So, I was shocked that this cream smells HORRIBLE with a strong medicinal, menthol smell, I found totally strong and offensive. I will use it if I need too, but people should know it smells HORRIBLE!!"
5,My doctore recommended it,"And, she was right! The only product I have found that helps heal split fingers. And, keeps them from hurting as well.We live in the Northeast and we heat with wood, all a recipe for split fingers.Great stuff."
3,Not what I was expecting,"After reading the comments I thought this would be the answer to my dry hands. But to be honest, it isn't any better than Jergens or Nivea. Plus, I don't care for the smell of this cream."
4,good translation choices,"I am no expert, but I do appreciate how difficult it is to translate Spanish literature from this period for a modern English-speaking audience, and I thought this edition was good. The notes complement the tranlation to give you a real flavor, and it is easy to see why these plays are classics."
2,Poor Edition,"This is a very bland modern translation that strips all poetry and musicality out of de Vega's language. I found it difficult to get much pleasure out of the versions of the plays in this collection. And the book has a surprising number of typos - 'chose' for 'choose,' 'its' for 'it's,' etc. I've been unimpressed with the quality of paper and especially the cover material of recent Oxford paperbacks, but usually it seems like the content is at least better prepared and edited."
1,Broken Jar!!!,We recieved a broken jar of olives and the varieties were not the ones that came in the variety pack!
1,Highly disappointing.....,"I have got to be one of the biggest Bossa Nova lovers that I know of. I live, sleep and dream about Bossa Nova. Heck, I even have named my Xbox live user name ""Bossa Nova"". However, this CD struck me as a huge disappointment. First of all, when I bought this I didn't realize that this was J-Pop mixed with Bossa Nova sounds. I thought it was straight Brazilian music. I like some J-Pop, which really stands for Japanese Pop. I LOVE Pizicatto Five! However the mix, doesn't mix well at all. It sounds extremely weird and I doubt I'll ever listen to this again. I'd rather listen to Bebel Gilberto on her excellent ""Tanto Tempo"" than listen to her singing this experimental junk!"
5,Need help.....,I own this and my daughter loves her booster car seat. I am trying to find a replacement cover for it and cannot find the manufacturers website. The website on my car seat says www.compassbaby.com but it keeps redirecting me to The Learning Curve website. Does anyone know if replacement covers are available?Thanks for the help
5,Great product!,"My daughter loves her new booster seat. She is 5 years old. I wanted her to be safe and comfortable especiallyfor those 3 hour drives to Grandma's house. Now her little 4 year old brother wants one (in blue). They can rest their heads against the side if they fall asleep, and yet still have a good view of things. Previously we had a Britax Wizard carseat and the kids didn't complain about it but I noticed their friends didn't seem to like the headrest part of it."
4,Grows with Her,"We love the Compass seat. First we got it for our son at 5 and every time he wasn't in the car, my 4-year old wanted to sit in it. We had her in the Marathon. But as she continues to grow, it was a great time to transition them both to the booster seat.We love the cup holders, arm rest, and fun colors for their preference. I like that it supports their back and neck more than some of the little square blocks we have seen.We are happy with it and I also like how it folds in half for easy carrying when needed."
5,Love It,"This is the best car seat! It's slight tilt helps my daughters head not fall forward when she falls asleep in the car, and the side head rest are big enough for her to rest. It's adjustable to grow with her. AND most improtantly i feel that she is safe in it. The pattern and colors are great."
5,COMPASS FOLDING CAR SEAT,"This is an excellent product. We bought an earlier version for my son last year and were very happy with it. My daughter (aged 3) wanted a pink car seat, so it was great to find the same car seat in the right color. The features on this model are improved: there is more wing protection; the seat has more padding and the fabric is much softer. The kids love the two cup holders. We love the fact that the seats fold in half, so fit in our hall closet, and they are light and easy to carry. The adjustable head rest means the kids will be riding in these seats for years to come. They are also the easiest car seats to fit; no fiddly straps, you just put the seat in the car and put the car seat belt around the child."
1,Good Art Flimsy Plot,"Being a long-time reader of Japanese, Korean, and sometimes even Chinese manga (manwa), I was incredibly disappointed in this piece. In truth one of the worst yaoi I have ever read. While the art is well done and evokative the plot is barely that: a plot. Character development is minimal and no true relationship is developed or expounded upon, and the characters seem ready to jump each other without much reason. The attempts at creating an interesting fantasy fall short, and there are rather weak attempts at giving meaning to the entire work. The end result is a work that smacks of common, raunchy American short erotica (which often seems little more than porn) coupled with manga-inspired art.For those who like smut and care for little else, you may definately like it (though the nudity is more subdued than some other yaoi), but for those of you who come to this expecting romance or entertainment apart from the smut, I recommend avid avoidance."
1,really bad !!,"I was really disappointed with this title. This book does not even come close to Japanese yaoi titles. The art is child like, and the story is weak. You don't like the characters, and you cannot get into the story. The sex is there, but it holds no meaning since you don't care about the characters.I wanted to like this book, but I couldn't. This book was a waste of my money, and I doubt I will buy from this publisher again.Jet"
2,very disappointed,If your looking for someing interesting AND explict keep on looking. the main story wasn't as intrigueing as i had hoped at all. And i felt nothing for the characters in the story.
3,"not bad, but seen better","had a nice story, and the art work wasnt as bad as some that this publisher has produced. will retain in my collection but I do warn other yaoi seekers to maybe look elsewhere."
4,easy & interesting,"I really enjoyed this book. A little too much about the author at first (I guess relevant to explanation). Very easy to follow, not a lot of mumbo, jumbo. To sum it up...helpful in understanding karma."
1,I am not worthy (apparently.),"If I want something for myself and materialize, shall we say.... mmmmm... oh, $100.00, I have taken that away from someone else. No, I don't think so.The author has spirit guides because she is one of the few delightful folks who are worthy. No. I don't think so.Upon closer examination, I have determined that I am not worthy of keeping this book in my collection. Furthermore, I will not trade it off to a used book shop, because I don't want this to fall into the hands of another unsuspecting reader.I wouldn't want that negative act to shape my future or anyone else's."
1,DONT BUY IN Baby Ultimate Children's Boutique,"IGot this sailor out fit for my baby and I was very disappointed on the quality I guess they import from Hong Kong because it's very very cheap materialTherefore, I decided to returnI call because I was concern in the amount was not the same one I paid and this rude woman called the manager star abusive verbal my answer machine she was rude mean and no class .She said she was the manager and she said she was the boss and she was so unprofessional I cannot believe they stay in businessIn addition, she brags she did so great and more lies."
2,Pretty plates - but poor design limits fuctionality,"Beautiful colors, great quality, but the raised edge of the dinner plate is quite wide and somewhat deep... leaving little room for food and rendering the the actual usuable size to be that of a salad plate. I personally would've purchased another brand, paying for usuable dinner plates rather than pretty plates for my plate rack. But I do love the other pieces, and use them all the time."
2,"inexpensive, but several problems","at $5 per place setting, this is a bargain, but these are the problems i have: first, the daisy yellow is much darker than the images at the website...it is more the color of dried out yellow mustard...not an attractive color...there is more brown tint in the yellow than illustrated. next, the dinner plate is not standard...it is nearly a shallow bowl...trying to cut a steak on it, you must center the steak in the middle to avoid the inclined sides...the effective size of the dinner plate is almost as small as a bread plate...unless serving a stew. so, i do think it is a good deal for $5...but they are not actually attractive in color and the dinner plate is an odd design which effects its usefulness. be well!"
4,pretty,"This dinnerware is very pretty but it seems like it is easy to break or chip, I just carefully set it down on the table or dishwasher. Every piece is big but I like it. For the price I got it I cannot complain."
5,2nd only to Anne of Green Gables,History with a therapeutic flare. More real than all of modern fiction. Her majesty held respect in the empire and showed postal profits.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS,"I loved this show, all seasons! It was so awesome! Loved the characters. Please get more of these British period pieces!"
3,Sort of like Little House on tthe Prairie genre,"I so looked forward to receiving these in the mail after watching the Elizabeth Gaskell BBC videos, but these are not near as compelling. I have watched 3 episodes and find them much like the Little House on the Prairie series. Self contained hour long short stories w/ the same characters. Perhaps this is due to the authors material, which I can not say, having not read them. But, they are merely a diversion, not a ""I could watch that one again"" or ""I want to share this one with my friends"" type show. Too bad as I recognise so many of the same fine actors from the Gaskell series..."
4,Lark Rise to Candleford: excellence,"This production succeeds in creating a lost world by its setting, adaptation of a classic memoir, and superb acting. I look forward to the next season."
4,Very entertaining,It has a good storyline and is easy to watch.The characters are very interesting.It is an excellent period piece.
5,Great Show!!!,"PBS needs to snap up this gem of a show - it's utterly delightful. I cannot wait for BBC to release a US format version.If you have been dreaming of a weekly costume drama, it's here! It exists! Based (Well, perhaps loosely) on the actual diary of the ""main"" character, Laura, Lark Rise to Candleford is a gentle series about rural vs. town life in the late 1800's.Laura is from the little hamlet, Lark Rise, and gets a position at the post office in town (Candleford) working for her mother's cousin, Dorcas the postmistress. Through her we're introduced to all the characters in the town & village and we follow them through their little adventures.If Lark Rise to Candleford was a food it would be banana pudding and vanilla wafers."
5,Can't stop watching!,"This periood piece is extremely well done, and full of heart warming stories. Beautiful cinematography. Already watching season 2. I am addicted!"
4,Enjoyable and Engrossing,"Lark Rise to Candleford is an entertaining period piece with a balance of subtle humor, deft characterizations, and personal drama. The characters sell the stories, which typically involve the small details of life in the small farming community of Lark Rise and the larger town of Candleford. The cast is excellent, the sets are lush (if unrealistic), and overall it is a fun glimpse of changing times. Well worth viewing."
5,Bravo!,"I love everything about this show from the actors, characters, story plot, scenery, and even some props. I find the stories interesting and educational. I look forward to the next season!"
4,enjoy,got this for my mother. she is enjoying it. it takes her a long time to watch a movie she is always getting up to do chores at home.
5,great viewing,"Good story...no violence or expliced sexI love...great family viewing, with life lessons... all the English series and movies are good family viewing..."
3,Lark Rise to ......Snooze,"The first season of this series is delightful. It's nice to see Julia Swahala in a role so different to Saffy in ""Ab Fab"", and Dawn French is fabulous, as always. But things start to drag midway thru the second season, and by the third the plots seem contrived, and the characters stagnant (bordering on annoying). Found the Prime streaming quite good."
4,What a gem.,"Why didn't I hear of this great show before? I started watching this on my new Kindle Fire and have enjoyed season 1 so far. It's going to be very hard to pace myself for the other seasons. There's humor, drama, wisdom and a few tearjerker moments. It's a very good series."
4,Lark Rise,Anyone who buys the Lark Rise to Candleford Series needs to know if you buy it in the download form it is missing scenes. I have watched both the download for and DVD form and found out there are many scenes missing. They are still good but not as good as buying the DVDS themselves.
5,Larkrise to Candleford,"Fantastic, great cast, well written, great character development, excellent cinematography, great costumes, funny, dramatic, everything you can want. And no violence, imagine!"
3,Lake Rise to Candleford,"We were happy that the series was available first. We enjoy it and was looking forward to seeing the first season. About half way in the first segment, the DVD stopped playing and skipped to another part. Them it did it again. Finally we had to go to the menu and select a later segment to play but we didn't get to see all of the first part. Other wise we were happy."
1,did not get my money back,This dvd was programmed for a different region - I sent it back - registered mail - and did not get my money back.
2,lark rise to candleford,"I was very disapointed in this BBC production. Although it is well done, it bears very little relationship to the books which together form one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. I guess the producers didn't think the books were dramatic enough and felt obligated to add plot lines not in the books. More respect for the source material would have produced a better product. If you love Lark Rise to Candleford, do not buy this. -Marge McCracken"
1,huge disappointment,"Gossip,evesdropping, breaking the law, etc seems to be the favorite pastime of these characters.Dorcas Lane is a spinster that is supposed to be of high moral character and enjoys all of the pastimes listed above, can't stay out of others business and enjoys a relationship with a married man.if I had to put up with neighbors like this I would move asap.I stupidly paid to watch"
5,Great program!,"Loved the characters and the stories. Great actors, loved the humor. Watched all the episodes and totally enjoyed them. Once you start you'll want to just keep going!!"
5,Review for Lark Rise,"I am absolutely delighted with this wonderful series and would highly recommend it for the viewing pleasure of anyone interested in great cinematography, authenticity, depth of charecters, richness of life learning and lessons, the possibility of true love within humankind expressed through television. The best-next to Anne Of Green Gables- I have had the pleasure of watching! Thank you's go out to all involved in the making of this series."
5,What a lovely series,"and as soon as I began watching it I discovered it had been cancelled. Now, that makes sense, several lovey stories that could have continued on for quite a while, a supremely successful BBC series and they cancelled it because it had been on a while? Seriously? Devoted followers are usually courted as long as they can possibly be, until all the flavor is gone. How many series do I own that are 10 seasons long? That I watched devotedly and then bought on DVD?This is one of them. BBC, you screwed up on this one."
5,A terrific series to get hooked on!,"I love this series! Simple stories, but very well written.,A great series to look forward to watching after a stressful day!"
5,Addicted!,"I love British dramas and this is one of the best. I wasn't entirely hooked the first few episodes, except for the beautiful cinematography. But by the fourth episode I was gone... Can't wait to continue discovering the citizens of Lark Rise and Candleford!"
5,Lark Rise to Candleford: The First Season,I loved this collection. The acting is superb. The story line is so interesting that I can hardly wait for my second season DVD to arrive. It truly give you a look into the past. I liked this as well as Cranford and Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle) my favorites of all time.
3,Sex with the ex bad or good?,"This book by Tyne O'Connell is about a woman, named Lola who's convinced that she should get back together with her ex husband Richard after seeing him with a 'leggy blonde' one night. So she decides to pursue him and get him back, against the wishes of her friends and boss, Charlie.Without going into to much detail about this book, I have to say I wanted to slap Lola for being such an idiot for wanting Richard back. From what we find about about Richard, he seems like a royal coke-head jerk %$#@!%. I dont see why she wanted to be with him, but as they say 'love is blind'."
2,Not the same quality as other Master Soldering Tools,"The heat output is not as high I expected for the rated wattage. The best I can say is that it barely does the job and I have had not needed repairs. However, I would encourage others to look at the UT-50 for electronics work (although it does not have a self-ignitor) or the UT-100Ski for general work. I have those older models, plus the UT-200. They are simply in a different class than this model."
2,Smooth Jazz Attempt Founders,"I have listened to Patti Austin's work, and when I heard she was doing a CD of some of Ella's greatest songs, I became nervous. The album was not musical slander (Kenny G over Louis Armstrong), but it most certainly did not do Ella justice. Austin's interpretations on such tunes as ""Too Close for Comfort"" were far from the innovation and style of Ella. Ella Fitzgerald was possibly the best jazz vocalist ever, and we can all learn from her legacy. For Austin to title her album ""For Ella"" seems a bit presumptuous, as this R&B ""Diva"" falls far short of the First Lady of Jazz. I would never discourage anyone from singing Ella, but though Austin is a respected figure in the smooth jazz community, she must realize that one must tread lightly over sacred ground."
3,fairly good.,"the glass bottles hold up really well, and the glue works well also. the suncatcher is not vey durable at all, and the box is somewhere in the middle. it was a fun hour or so i spent with this kit, and i still have one of the bottles. i wouldn't recommend this to neat freaks (the little pieces go EVERYWHERE) but for anyone else it's pretty fun."
4,Works well,Works pretty well for us. Not really much side effects as I can tell. Maybe headaches if miss a week of doses.
3,Okay,Notice no difference.. Wouldn't buy again. There was no significant difference in appetite or weight loss while taking these pills.
2,Relora vitamins,"This item is as described, and I used it for 3 months, but didn't really see any results. It may work for someone else, just not for me."
3,Not the best of the genre but a few good gems.,"Hot from Frankfurt, West Germany, this CD contains locally produced SpeedGarage rather than the usual British and American players. Track 5: TURN IT UP by the Hustlers Convention has got it! The female vocal grabs you ""Just turn it up!"" A true party anthem! Matthew's Blunt Force Dub of POST MODERN SLEAZE (Sneaker Pimps) will also grab your attention. For dark, moody SpeedGaragers there's Suburban Soul's BURNIN' UP, (track 13). Overall, not a terrible disc, but not the first one I'd grab off the shelf either!"
2,Not all ferrets are created equal in size,"I got this box for my little ferret girl when I saw she didn't like trying to squeeze all four feet into her short box when she used it. I will admit the box is longer, but it is narrower as well. I later got a second ferret and tried this box on him. But seeing he's a hefty 2.8 lbs, compared to my little 1.8 lb girl, he filled the whole box when he stepped into it. I dunno about you, but no one wants to us the toilet when they are cramped (hence why you are shopping for this product).If you are looking for more room for your fuzzy, I would suggest going to your local market and picking up a $3 storage box that is about 1.5 ft x 1 ft (find one with a smooth bottom for easy scooping) and cutting a dip out of the long side of it that is low enough for your fuzzy to come and go. I also use around the house a $2 small cat litter box from wally world that i cut a dip in as well."
2,Not for a BUNNY!,"I have a Bunny, and the second I put it in her cage she started to bite on it. Next Morning half thing was chewed up. NOT GOOD FOR BUNNIES!!! But she did go potty in there, that was the plus side. Make it so that BUNNIES dont chew on it! Please!!!"
1,Very small,This litter pan is very small. I doubt even a dwarf rabbit could use it. It also doesn't stay put and my bunny would flip it all of the time.
4,Should be a TV Show!,"Monkey Business is filled with complex characters all going through a major life transformation, navigating the tumultuous world of business school. Anyone who has ever been involved in the group dynamics that evolve with an educational institute as a backdrop can understand and appreciate the obstacles that students (and people) face. There is competition, friendship, loyalty, trust, romance, fear and turmoil. Mlynowski explores each one of these facets with her wonderful novel MONKEY BUSINESS. A story about a group of friends whose lives are so captivating that it makes the reader wish their stories could continue...perhaps on television?!"
5,Wonderful,I couldnt put this book down. I loved how each chapter was looking at things from each character's prospective!
5,Sarah Mlynowski is the ruler of chick lit!,"I looooove this author and I looooove this book. It has a tight interwoven plot line that is at times laugh out-loud funny and at other times even a little touching (okay, okay I cried). I really, really admire the way Mlynowski writes. Her stories are BY FAR the best chick lit books that I've read, and I read a lot of chick lit. I liked the way the plot had so much going on, and by the end I felt satisfied that everything was resolved/addressed so that it felt like a complete and realistic book. Oh and did I mention how FUNNY she is? I also highly recommend MILKRUN and FISHBOWL. Great book!!!!!"
4,enjoyable with some small flaws,Changeling: the Dreaming has many virtues and a few flaws.White Wolf has done it again. Their latest effort has many virtues. The background is wonderful and full of suprises. The blend of old stories with modern settings has many opportunities for fun and exciting role-playing. The character types are very interesting and varied. The artwork throughout the book is excellent and all of the pages are in full color. There are a couple of flaws. The first is many aspects of the game are very ambigious. A great deal of interpretation is needed in many places. The system for glamour (magic) given uses cards and is very cumbersome. The rest of the system is standard White Wolf fare. I would reccomend buying this game because it is a lot of fun to play. The player's guide (sold seperately) help clear up many aspects of the game and is almost a neccessity.
3,RPG,"A game in that whole White Wolf family. This one is a little lighter in tone, being set in and amonster the world and peoples of faerie and the fey. A lot of sneaking around and fooling the mortals, and hopefully not being disappeared by mages, eaten by werewolves or tormented by vampires."
5,A break-through in learning to read and write!,"This series teaches you how to teach your child- fresh, practical, memorable! Does not require much time to 'study ahead' before lessons.This incredible series taught my SLD child to read and write fluently! Fresh ideas, winsome, memorable, practical! Consumable workbooks also available from Amazon and original publisher at reasonable cost, and the series grows with your student in subsequent volumes."
5,Love it!!,"My friend recommended it and I love this product. I was using plastic containers for my son's lunch in daycare, but with all the warnings about plastic and microwave and heat... this is the best alternative. The food stays HOT for 8 hours, no need to reheat, can take along on day trips and much much more."
5,Thermos Foogo Food Jar,"This jar is great. Exactly what it's supposed to do, it does. I took some hot food for my 15 month old son to the pool. I was thinking it'll be cooled enough for him to eat it when we get there, but it was still hot! Haven't tried with cold food, but I'm sure it won't disappoint. Very happy with the purchase."
2,does not keep food warm,"I put hot porridge in here and within an hour the porridge turned cold, not cool, but cold. 2 stars for not leaking."
4,very good,great only a little heavy & harder for my youngest (kinder) to open and close tightly - keeps food hot a long time
5,Wonderful Thermos,"I bought two of these thermos for my boys to take to school. Yesterday was the first day we used them, I warmed up the soup for them at 745 in the morning and by 12:00 my son actual burnt his tongue. IT WAS AMAZING that they still were that hot. THANK YOU"
1,I can not even keep warm,"Read reviews and numerous rumors and bought lunch insulation.After receiving attends outings when you're putting baby formula. Longer warm to hot water bottles to keep the pre-warm. Within just two to three hours outside of the food did not have the warmth. He then went on to use your neighbor, the mother's warmth pugoneun well that I have been different from what was to be hot.Quite a bit of time seems to be defective or onboard, but all my stuff.You can not buy a new pugoreul again. You want me to be compensated."
5,I like it!!,It can keep food hot for several hours which was very ideal for our case. I love it!! Recommend it to people who want give your child warm food when out.
3,ok but could keep food warmer,it's ok but not as expected does not keep food hot for more than 1 hour wish it did because i purchased these so kids could take hot soup to school. despite what other reviews say it does not keep food hot or warm for more than 1 hour.
5,Best,"We have used this product for our daughter for 2 weeks. It works great and provides our daughter warm lunch every day. Before this product, we have purchased other 2 brands, none of them really can keep the food warm after 3-4 hours. We really like this food jar and would recommend it to other parents who are thinking of giving their little ones warm lunch at daycare or pre-school every day."
5,Foogo Food Jar gets 5 stars!!! :),"Foogo food jar performs as promised - my sons lunch is warm 4 hours into the day (finally!) :) I will, however, add that the foogo thermos CUP keeps temperature wonderfully but does leak. The food jar is a 5 star - cup 4 stars. Hope this helps!"
2,Doesn't work as promised,"This thermos does not keep food hot for 5 hours- maybe 2 if you are lucky. My daughter takes spaghetti o's for lunch at preschhol. I make them at 8am and by 11:30am when they eat lunch, she tells me they are cold."
3,"It's small, but does the job.","A good thermo for a very small meal or a few fruits. Quality is top, but I wish it would be roomier, if the top would be a bit flatter, it could fit a yogurt cup. Too bad it doesn't!"
3,Not leak proof,"This product's description says it is ""leak-proof"". This is entirely false with the product I received. It not only leaks, it leaks a lot."
4,Great for Kids,"We moved to colder climates last year so sandwich and chips just wasn't enough for our kids on cold days.We wanted to get a thermos that looked nice, encourages the kids to bring it back home, and was functional at the same time. So we picked these up because we could get different colors for each of the kids.Now my husband will make them some hot soup at about 7:30 in the morning and by lunch time at 12:30 the kids have said everything is still hot. The other nice thing is they say all there friends comment them on their thermos."
5,THIS IS VERY GOOD,THE KIDS SAID THEIR LUNCH IS SUPER HOT EVERYDAYIT IS VERY EASY TO KEEP LUNCHES HOT IN IT THANKS
4,hope can keep food hot longer!,So glad to received it.The color is beaurtiful.I bought it for my little son. I think he will like itIt will be perfect If can keep food hot longer time
3,ok,"Product had verysepsific smell, I washed it several times - but steel smelly. My sun fefused to use it beacuse of that. otherwise I think smell goes away, and it seems quite ok.........."
3,Handy but Lid hard for kids,"I have sent my 2 kids (11 and 8) to school with this at least once a week for the past year. It has held up very nicely and keeps the food fairly warm for 5-ish hours. I have sent spaghetti, mac and cheese, and soups. My only complaint is that it is pretty difficult for my kids to re-screw the lid on perfectly themselves. Therefore, if there is any leftover soup, it will leak out all over their lunchbox or backpack. Not so great. It took a bit of practice for even ME to be able to screw it on perfectly! LOL! Anyhow, overall its been a very handy thing to have and the kids like taking this to school."
2,Keeps my soup from leaking..... and that's about it.,"My husband bought this for me to take soups and pasta to work and keep it warm. I have not been able to have the food stay even luke warm by lunch time. Its a very nice jar, but it doesn't do much more than hold my food. I've tried putting boiling water in the thermos beforehand and having it set. I've tried letting very hot (burning my hands hot) water run into it for a while. I've had the food piping hot and steaming and no matter what I do, it is cold in about an hour or so. It is a shame because its a nice design, looks great, light, washes nice in the dishwasher or by hand and doesn't leak; but I really just wanted to have at least warm soup for lunch. Really disappointing for my first Thermos product."
2,Too Small,"This thermos is too small. It won't even hold an entire can of soup. Might be good for a toddler who only eats a partial can of soup, but for older children, go one size larger."
3,This jar is same as the ones that are avialable at 1/2 price,"i ordered one of the so called Foogo and non-Foogo jars, they are identical but this is twice much in price."
4,3 hours later and still hot as if out of the microwave,"We use this to take our sons food on the go. After three hours, steam is still coming out. It's just great to have and not have to worry about finding a microwave when we're out. The only drawback is that it can get pretty dirty in the blue, bottom area where it meets the steel. It seems to not be fully sealed so if it gets mixed up in the sink with dirty dishes, it's impossible to clean inside the cracks - however this is very minor and the area I'm talking about is very unnoticable, perhaps only to me!"
5,Wow! This really works! I,"We had another name-brand product that just didn't keep food hot until lunch-time. When it fell apart, we decided to try this one. What a difference! My daughter's food isn't just warm at lunch time, it is really hot! I hope this Thermos will last a long time."
5,it is good,I try it with warm water and it is good for tempreture. I like it and my daughter also like it.
4,Keeps food warm,Nice product. Keeps kids lunch food warm until lunchtime. I wish it would retain a little more heat for my liking. Considering thought it's about a 4 hour wait until lunch from packing it works great.
4,"Good for keeping your lunch warm, a bit too small though.","After eating school lunch for 4 years, my 9-year old daughter finally grew tired it, she insisted on taking our dinner leftover to school for next day at school. But she didn't have access to a microwave at school, and I would never let her have a cold Chinese lunch. After much researching online, i.e. amazon.com, I finally came across this food jar and thought I would give it try. To my surprise, it worked. I would micromave her lunch in the morning and put it into the jar, by the time she had lunch at school, the food would be still lukewarm. The only complaint I have is its size, a little on the small side, so after some more research, I bought another one slightly larger.Thermos Stainless King SK3000MB4 Food Jar, Midnight Blue"
4,Works great!,"I bought one of these thermoses for my son's school lunch. He prefers hot food, and it said it would keep food hot for 5 hours. Plus, I thought it was nice design. Well, it works great and definitely keeps food hot for a long time. I bought a second one for my daughter's lunches. My only complaint so far is that the rubbery parts on the lid and base can discolor, especially with something like tomato sauce."
5,Very Pleased!,"My son has been taking his great new Thermos Foogo to school every day since it has arrived at our house and it works like a charm! He is on a very restricted diet (intolerant to most sugar, grain, dairy, and soy products) which eliminates sandwiches and many other things that he would prefer to bring to school for lunch than what I send him. Once this arrived, he has been taking hot meatballs & sauce, barbeque pork, soup, cut up turkey burgers w/pizza sauce, taco filling (w/o shell)and any leftovers that travel well. He loves it! Thanks Foogo!E. LeBlanc"
2,leak but not heat proof,"I put food in here for an HOUR and its FREEEZING!! I put it in the microwave for four minutes on high heat and it was warm when I left the house, but an hour later, I may as well have put it in a gladware. It doesn't leak but it doesn't function as a Thermos."
5,The perfect thermos for my kindergartner,This thermos is exactly what I was looking for. It fits perfectly in my 5 year olds lunch bag and keeps her food warm. I definitely recommend it.
2,Won't Keep Food Warm,"I use this to send my daughter's lunch to school. I heat the food as hot as I can in the morning, but she complains that the food is cold by lunchtime. Her class goes to lunch at 10:55 AM, which I think is a pretty early lunch. I am looking for something else that will actually keep her food warm."
4,storage jar,"The jar seems to be as advertised.I have only used it once. The lid fits well and it sit flat on the bottom, should fit well in a lunch bag or box."
5,Love,"My daughter doesn't like sandwiches, yogurt only once a week, cheese stick is for snack - that left us with very few lunch options. School lunch is not appealing to us. Foogo is the perfect answer. I make meals and keep them in the freezer (meatloaf, chix pot pie, spaghetti pie, rolled pizza). Choose one the night before, warm it in the microwave while we heat the foogo with hot water and her lunch is warm and delicious. A wonderful solution. The size is great. Fits in her LL Bean lunch bag comfortably with her snack each day. We're so happy to have found this gem and wouldn't give it back. This is one item you will be happy with purchasing."
2,Not too good,"Boiling stuff will be cold at the five hour mark. Not good for my work schedule. I ordered two, one for my self and one for my boyfriend. They are both about the same as far as how long they keep food warm for"
5,love it,It does what it says it will do. Holds hot food or cold. I didn't purchase this for a child but for myself and I'm a 59 year old female. The led is perfect and not difficult to open. I have lost some strength in my hands and yet I can open it without a problem. Who can ask for more!
1,DO NOT PUT BOILING WATER IN THIS,"Do not put boiling water in this.My daughter put boiling water in this, leaving a reasonable amount of space (i.e. not up to the top)and put the lid on securely.. walked from the kitchen a few paces, the metal sides sucked in and the top blew off. She has suffered a dreadful burn to the inside of her forearm, it has been dressed for 2 weeks now, had a tetanus injection (recommended by GP) and has been in absolute agony. Luckily she had just put her 12 month old to bed and wasn't carrying him at the time. She will be contacting Consumer Affairs & Thermos (in Australia) about this. This is a DANGEROUS product for boiling water. There is no warning accompanying this product advising not to put boiling water in it. Please be warned."
1,do not buy these,"I've had three of these since September 2011. At first I was delighted with them.This week, the lids failed on all three of them. They all contained soup at the time. Fun.Inexcusable.I (wish I could) give this item NEGATIVE stars."
2,Disappointed with thermos,I purchased this thermos for my son who likes a hot lunch. Have had it for 1 month and the first three weeks it worked great. I put boiling water into the thermos to heat the inside for a minute and cooked either soup or spaghettio's and added it to the thermos. The lunch was hot everyday for 3 weeks but the last 7-9 days the contents are cold when opened at school. Nothing different was done in the preparation for the food. Any advice?Disappointed mom and son
3,good quality,a nice thermos but too small for a lunch bag. It wasn't clear that it was meant to be for children food and not adult portions. It keeps things warm in any case and it is easy to clean.
1,Lid,"The lid doesn't screw on very well. It's poorly made. If they could just come up with a better lid, this would be a GREAT product. I have several other foogoo products and they are great."
3,sturdy but not warm,"i like the product, but my girl said that the food was not hot (hardly warm)at lunch time. It is a nice product unless you want the food to stay hot/warm.I'm not sure why it is not insulated better...???"
4,Works great for my son's preschool,"While I can't say how hot it keeps his food (I'm not the one opening it for him for lunch), his teachers haven't told me anything to imply that it's not keeping his food warm. My two gripes is that 1. Its large for a kid's lunch bag (especially a toddler), and 2. the lid has a gap where it screws onto the jar that can be hard to clean in the crevices. Otherwise this is the smallest food thermos I've seen available. It matches his Thermos Foogo straw cup, which is also a nice design."
2,Disappointed,I purchased two of these for my daughters. Both leaked in their lunch bags. My oldest daughter had lunch 5 hours after filling the thermos and on both occasions the food was cold. My youngest child had lunch 4 hours after filling the thermos and she complained the food was barely warm. Very disappointed with this product. Will only be using these for Mac n cheese or similar foods that taste okay at room temp.
3,small,"when I receive this item, it is too small that I did not imaged. Now I have not know whether it could keep warm well."
5,Ready for school,"I bought this for my daughter who is starting school this year. She doesn't eat a ""traditional"" sandwich type lunch and without a stove/microwave I was concerned about what she was going to eat. With this good sized thermos - she now can have her rice and beans (everyday) without it being cold with all her fruit snacks. We were able to put her name sticker on it and she can open it easily herself. Great insulation on the lid and base will help not burn her too."
5,Fantastic,"This is a wonderful product. I make my son his noodles in the morning, put them in the thermos and they are still hot at lunch!"
1,Doesn't perform as expected,"Thought it was maybe that I was just storing the container in my too cold trunk but this container didn't keep my food warm for even an hour when I had it in a pack up against my body. I did as they suggest and preheated the container but it still didn't perform. Oh, well! Keeps food sorta cold, I guess!"
1,HARD TO OPEN FOR CHILDREN,This product is hard for my daughter to open she has to have her teachers help. I wish I could write a good review but when your child can't open her own Thermos. there is something wrong.
5,Very good thermos,"I used this all year for my Kindergartener. It worked well. I put very hot tap water in it and placed the top on for a minute or so before filling it with food. Then, heated the food 'til it was very hot. That combination of steps resulted in warm food 3 1/2 hours later. I am not sure you have to go through all those steps but it worked for me. Food might have been hot without doing so - but I can't promise."
4,Pink is for girls.,"OK,there are two kinds of Jars: blue one for boy and pink one for girl. It is just strange why a girl will simply insist on pink color of everything: shoes, bags, and jars. OK, bought as a gift for such demanding girl as a gift. It serves the purpose of insulation, but its rubber bottom starts to get loose in about a year."
3,Okay,"This food jar is really cute and keeps the food contained, but after being in the thermos for just 3 hours the food is only luke-warm. I was expecting better."
2,these dont work,i bought 2 of these to keep my kids meals hot but even after following the instructions of putting hot water in it before they complain their food gets cold by lunchtime....dissappointed
5,Incredible Product,This solved a problem we had. What to send to school for lunch. Soup stays piping hot with no leaks and my 16 year old isn't ashamed by the sleek design of the product way to go. She takes it to school often .Others have asked her where to get one.at 16 they are all about looks and this product doesn't fall short on looks or performance.
4,thermos,kept my soup nice and warm until my lunchtime. Holds a large serving which may be enough for a complete lunch for many people.
3,"Good, but not as hot as I'd like","This thermos is much better than others I have used, but I think that because the plastic lid mus allow too much heat to escape. Food is sort of warm by lunch time, but not very warm like I would expect for a vacuum sealed thermos."
5,thermos/bowl,Really glad I purchased this thermos. My daughter can have a hot meal instead of a sandwich every day. Works great and has never leaked!!! Like it a lot!!!
5,A must have for kids/ lunch boxes,"I have 2 of these I bought from Amazon, and they're the only ones I'm using for my daughter's lunches. Being a health coach, I'm not too fond of a cold PBJ sandwich everyday, so I use these for hot lunches like vegetable balls, meat balls, organic pasta with cheese and more! (And for snacks or fresh fruits/veggie cuts I prefer Bento boxes!)This one we bought for my best friend's baby son. So she can give him the good home cooked meals when she's out, instead of the baby-food in jars"
5,Would recommend!,Keeps my baby's food warm or cold as necessary and seems that will last enough for him to start taking to school with him. Highly recommended!
2,"Ok Sound, but retractable part broke in 1 day","I bought these to use only on my laptop because my cat would keep chewing the regular headphones when I left them unattended. They sound OK, but the retractable mechanism broke in only one day... What a piece of S[h.it!!! The headphones won't retract anymore and my cat will eat them again...fml!Don't buy this crap, I'm so angry I'll eat them before my cat does!!!!"
1,Junk-,"Purchased two of these for wife and myself. Mine for use with iPhone4 and wife's for iPad. Niether will stay extended, they snap back to stored position. Way too short unless you were to carry iPhone / iPad in your shirt pocket. LOL Impossible to use when they snap back to stowed position, they sound fine if you want to manually keep them extended and chance losing an eye on snap back."
3,Handy but have a fundamental design flaw,"These earbuds have a fundamental design flaw: The repeated motion of tugging on the wires to deploy and retract the wires causes the little wires beneath the rubber coating to weaken and break. Think bending a twist tie back and forth over and over until the wire breaks and it becomes limp. After about 9 months of use one earbud would continually cut out unless I held the wire just so.That said, I really enjoyed them for those 9 months! A lot of people on here complain about the length, and that may be true if you mount your device on your belt, but if you keep it in a shirt pocket or top jacket pocket like me they're great for keeping wires out of the way.Sound quality is a little mediocre compared to, say, the Sony ones I replaced the with, but I would sacrifice that little bit of sound quality for the amount of convenience they afforded me by turning my iPod Nano into a compact little system."
1,"Good concept, terrible execution","The ear buds are huge and hurt my ears. The length is too short. And the cables get tangled.Great idea, though."
1,not recommended,the design is clever.. but really doesn't work well... you must extend both the headphones AND the audio jack at the SAME TIME or else the cords get tangled up(the instructions on the box state this).. but that's a pain.the metal aligator clip is in a terribly unuseful place - 2.5 inches from the audio jack.the worst thing about this product is that the length of the headphones is way too short. Fully extended it's only about 3 ft long. The sony headphones I currently have are almost 6 ft long.the extra length is absolutely necessary.this pair will be going back to Amazon.
3,Not what I expected,"The idea of making these headphones retractable seems like a good idea, but they have a tendency to get messed up if you don't retract them right. The worst part is, though, the chord is only 3 feet long. That sounds like enough, but its only long enough to reach to your pocket or something. And, considering they cost $15, it's just not worth is. Koss has a $5 pair that are just as good, just not retractable."
2,Would not purchase again,"The cord for these ear phones was too short, and they broke easily within 5 days. The product is cheaply made. I would not recommend this product."
3,Chilton book for Chrysler Cirrus,"It's like most Chilton books for the Shadetree mechanic. It helps to have but it doesn't have all the information you really need and if you're not already pretty good at working on cars, you'll still be lost. I'd still recommend it as if you don't have anything you're working completely blind. It helps, but so does google."
2,Too runny,The bleach solution was too runny. Dripped right off. Mixed the activator and the bleach solution like instructed but the bleach solution was a lot runnier than the last product I tried. Once mixed applied to face and it just dripped right off.
1,Waste of Money,"This product did not work for me at all, It didn't lighten any hairs and infact, it burn't all my little fine hairs off. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Now, I gotta find something that will work for me because now I have more hair to bleach or get rid of."
2,Activator spoils before you're halfway through it,"So that you have to keep repurchasing it every other time you want to bleach and are left with tons of spatulas and plates and bottles of bleach waiting in queue to be used left over. Over a very small span of time after purchasing it, the activator first turns into wet clumps and finally into a droopy mess. No idea what the chemical f#$% is going on there but I'd appreciate some insight.Aside from this, it does work for the most part initially, but quickly loses its power after the activator begins to fail. I pray to the heavens for another competent facial hair bleach to come my way."
1,It bleaches the skin!,"I don't care for the Sally Hansen line. I've used the creme hair bleach and the the creme hair remover over the years and now noticed that my skin on top of my mouth is bleached white. I noticed after working out at the gym that my face is red EXCEPT where I have used the product. Not good. I'm looking for other products to use, perhaps an organic line that doesn't contain what Sally Hansen's ingredients are. I wouldn't recommend this product from my experience using it almost 7 years. I'm sure there are better (albeit more pricey) lines out there that use gentler ingredients and don't bleach your skin. I hope the skin around my mouth regains its color if I stop using Sally Hansen."
1,Burned skin!,"This is the worst facial hair bleach cream out there. It burned my skin like crazy that I had to call the emergency and poison control center. The marks lasted well over several months. I reported the incident to Sally Hansen, but they never bothered to write back even though I provided all the lot and manufacturing info. DO NOT BUY SALLY HANSEN!"
4,Lightens hair and skin,"It turned my hair blond, but my skin seemed to be bleached noticeably as well. I didn't experience the burning/itching sensation."
5,Good for lightening brows,"Bought this stuff as the usual facial bleach I use wasn't available. I use it to lighten my brows, since I bleach my hair and have naturally dark blonde eyebrows. I left it on for about 4-5 minutes, and for the last minute or so, I used a clean eyebrow wand to comb the product through for a more natural look. I wouldn't recommend leaving it on for the full 8+ if your goal is to lighten and not bleach. My brows came out the perfect light blonde color I was aiming for. Follow all directions, and keep a close eye on the bleach while the color is lifting. I'm convinced the pre-conditioner is responsible for not leaving my skin irritated- usually after using bleach on my face, my skin tends to get a bit dry around the area. Well done, Sally Hansen."
2,"""Your Face""... and some other stuff...","""Your Face"" from 1987 is three minutes of inspired jittery scribbly animated brilliance: it's strange, funny, even somehow grotesquely lovely. But the rest of this stuff? His previous efforts range from mildly amusing to embarrassingly amateurish. After ""Your Face,"" Plympton increasingly coasts along on endless variations of the same two or three ideas. And in the meantime, unfortunately, he animated one of the worst music videos I've ever seen: Peter Himmelman's ""245 Days."" Plus, the ""bonus feature"" documentary profiles of Plympton are unwatchably bland and boring. Should have combined the best of this material with Plympton's feature-length film The Tune to create a much more appealing Plymptoons DVD."
1,Please don't advertise what you don't have,I ordered two items for my sister. After almost three weeks my money was returned with a notice that the items were not in stock. The items were a present for her. I will not order from this seller again.
1,Waste of money...,I should have listened to the other reviewers. Hardly made a difference. $28 gone. Get the KX4D LED Conversion Head instead. You will be happy you did. Don't waste your money on this.
3,Its OK...,"...Recently got both the P60 and the P61.....The P60 has a bigger circle with just a hint of yellow.....The P61 had a smaller circle but was only slightly brighter,no yellow......This was measured from about 10 feet against a white wall..........Next time just get the P60...its a better buy.......etc..."
2,Much less than expected,I purchased 2 Surefire flashlights with 80 lumens bulbs. I also purchased 2 P61 120 lumens bulbs as an upgrade. When we installed the P61 120 lumens bulb in one of the flashlights and then shined both on a dark wall there was little or no difference. Very disappointed after spending so much for the bulbs.
5,"Nice kitchen, but not for boys","This is such a great kitchen - it has all the bells and whistles and the stove and sink both have sounds and light up. However, it was VERY difficult to assemble (don't do it Christmas Eve) and many of the parts just do not fit properly. We never did get the phone to install correctly. In addition, the piece that goes inside the dishwasher and the stove is very flimsy, so much so that it is now bowed. This stove does come with quite a few cooking pieces so that's an added plus. It's a lot of fun for my little ""Emeril"" but find something more durable if you have a boy."
3,Good Product but missing something,"It is quite big and I felt worth the money. It would not break easy, quite durable, however it did not hold my daughter's attention for long she played with it about a week and then was not interested in it after that. You need to buy a cooking set to go with it, because it just does not have enough cooking gear to go with it."
4,My 19-month-old loves it!,"I bought this for my daughter at 18 months and although she didn't fully understand the concept of cooking yet (she doesn't see me use the oven or range much), once I showed her how to ""heat a ba-ba"" in the microwave, she couldn't stop doing this, and used the baby chair to feed it to all her stuffed animals. As I've bought more play food (Constructive Playthings is a good source for high-quality vinyl food) she loves it more and more. We had to use power tools to attach the cell phone holder, but no big deal. I wish the microwave buttons made sounds, as that's the cooking appliance she's most familiar with! Overall, we're very happy with the product."
4,"Fun, but not built to last","I used to think that something from Little Tykes would be found in good shape a thousand years hence--an artifact from our age. That's how durable the toys my 11-year old had from this company when he was a toddler. This kitchen doesn't meet the old Little Tykes standard. Although it was very difficult to assemble--that was something I could deal with. What disappoints me is the poor quality. We bought it for our 2 year old (yes, that is under the age range), for Christmas and within a week the sink faucet was broken off; in less than a month one of the stove knobs was broken. However, I have to admit it is a clever, engaging design and the kids aren't necessarily bothered by the things that have been taped and glued back on. Why can't their new designs be executed with their old quality? Get back on track, Little Tykes!!!"
2,I took it back!!! Phone would not stay on.,"I really love Little Tikes normally. In fact, we practically have one of everything. However, this particular kitchen is awful. The phone would not stay on the side of the kitchen, which was really a disappointment. My daughter would get so frustrated every time the base would come off. The top of it constantly came off as well. The other thing that was disappointing is the it does not have a dishwasher and fridge like the upgraded model has. The only great thing about it was that it could fit nicely into a corner. This was not enough to keep it though. We took this little tikes nightmare right back to the store after many attempts at making it work. My recommendation would be to spend the extra few dollars and get the nicer one. You can get the other one on sale for just dollars more then this one's regular price. It was definately the right move for us."
4,Hard to assemble,"This kitchen was a wonderful Christmas gift for my 2 yr. old son He loves It!! I, on the other hand, really worked up a sweat putting it together...you really need some muscles!! I never got the top piece totally on & even my husband tried & it wouldn't come back off. Also, we had to super glue the phone holder on. Other than that, my son is really enjoying it, & it seems pretty durable."
3,Not What I expected,"I would like to comment that this toy as shown on the picture did not match in color to what was delivered in the box. In addition the structure seems flimsy, some what cheap and lite weight. The colors are dull and washed out consiting of pink, light blue and dull white. For the cost, overall I am disapointed in this product."
3,The Microwave door broke off the first day.,"We bought this toy for my 2 and 3 year old boys. They are pretty ruff and broke the microwave door off in the first day. My three year old loves it but keeps knocking it over. Now I wish I would have bought something with more storage for his dishes,a refrigerator, and more room for both of my boys to play at the same time. The phone wont stay on either."
2,Poor design of cookin sounds kitchen,I purchased a cookin' sounds gourmet kitchen for my 2 year old daughter less than a year ago and the sounds have never worked for any length of time. The sink part of the kitchen is right next to the range part and if any drips of water get into the burner it will quit making sounds. Little tykes offered to send me replacement parts for an additional 15 or so dollars. I feel that I have invested enough money and they should fix the problem. Otherwise it's just another generic plastic kitchen.
5,Needs revision!,"I bought the Little Tykes Cookin' Sounds Gourmet Kitchen for my 2 year old last week. I was very excited because the box advertised that the kitchen had 11 sounds which is quite a lot, I thought. Not sure where they got 11, because including the stove/grill (3), phone (1), and faucet(1), I only count 5. And, as other reviews have noted, the phone holder DOES NOT stay in place, and constantly falls off the kitchen side. I'm guessing we'll have to attempt to super-glue it. Which sort of defeats the purpose of paying $70 for a durable, well-built toy, only to have to super-glue its parts to make them stay in place.Other than that, my daughter loves making ""dinners."" I had to buy an additional set of 'fake food' as the kitchen only comes with a hotdog. I think its a very fun toy, though! My daughter and I have already spent countless hours 'washing dishes' and 'cooking meals' in her little kitchen. It's a great pretend-play item."
3,Average kitchen,"I purchased this toy for my 2 year old daughter for Christmas, and so far it's been great. It wasn't the easiest toy to put together (I would have rather had written directions instead of arrows), and the phone stayed in placed perfectly BUT it was too close to the top of the microwave which makes it very difficult for my daughter to 'answer' it when it rings. But all in all she really enjoys the sounds and pots...but if she were older I may not have made this particular purchase."
4,Great value.,"We bought this for my 2 yr old son for his birthday (today). So far so good. Easy to put together, cute sounds, great size. Would like it better if the stove and microwave had 'real' buttons and not just stickers. Also oven door opens to the left intstead of down like a real oven door but he got the hang of it quick. Overall a good toy for the price."
5,Fun revisited day after day.,Our 19 month old girl loves this toy! She has played with it at least once a day since we purchased it over a month ago. Dad had no problem with the assembly or the mechanics of the doors as some of the other reviews have stated. The kitchen is sturdy and does not tip over and appears that it will wear well over time.
2,Doesn't stay together,I love this toy and grew up playing a toy just like it. However; this toy does not stay together. After every turn you have to manually put the poles back in the holes in order to play again. It is very annoying and it can also pop out during a turn destroying what you were trying to achieve. I wouldn't buy this toy again. I would try another brand that may be put together better.
3,Not quite the same,"I had Shoot the Moon for 30 years and sold it at a garage sale just before my 8yo grandson wanted the game. I looked everywhere for it in stores (he had seen it while on a faraway vacation); finally ordered it online but it's not the same as the original one I had -- or the one he'd played. This one is too easily won -- not sure why; if I find one that is more challenging, I will consider buying it -- but not online. Need to try it first."
4,Short but to the point.,"This is a very interesting book, its short but good, I just wish she would have really let loose and wrote alot more about the things she lived threw in her life.The things she did write about kind of blew me away, to think that this sort of thing goes on, , , ,no one should have to ever live like this."
1,crap!,"I love tits and street fighting as much as the next guy but this just fell short. It's just an hour of 20 second clips. The girls were hot but over all the movie just wasn't worth watching. Ninety percent of the movie doesn't even have sound, it's just rap music playing threw the whole damn movie. The worst part was that the director tried to get artsy with it by using fish eye lenses, black and white scenes, slow motion, and rewind. It's hard to mess up something so simple but the managed to do it. They actually made tits and fighting unwatchable."
3,Good Fight Tape,I was stationed in Iraq and I needed something funny to watch to past the time. There are some good fights and a really good girl fight in the end. The only problem is that there is too much of bong hit footage and that gets real boring fast.
4,battery tester,nice but wish it had a printer and hard to find a repair person for my old one but for now works good price was good too
2,Embarrassangly ignorant about music; fair-minded otherwise.,"By her own admission, Easton knows little about music. This does not prevent here from offering us a great deal of inofrmation about music, most of it mistaken. She shares with a lot of people in this position an embarrassing naivete about what it is to perform, and a corresponding lack of insight into the particular circumstances of du Pre's retirement from the stage. It is hard to understand why someone who knows nothing of music should want to write the story of one of the century's leading musicians. Given that she has done so, it is a reasonable job, as far as one can tell, in relation to the non-musical facts. She is particularly fairminded in dealing with the enigma of du Pre's final nurse, Ruth Ann."
5,satisfied customer,"Product arrived sooner and was of better quality than expected. Good show. But of course, I have never been disappointed with an article from Amazon"
3,"Good, but...","This is one of those books where a semi-interesting story rolls merrily along for most of the book and then everything happens in the penultimate chapter. Although a surprise, the conclusion was one of the most contrived and silly that I have read in a long time. I don't think I will be reading any more of Kendell O'Dell."
5,Better then the first,This was a really entertaining book. I didn't know how the story would end and I couldn't stop reading. The Devil's Cradle was exciting and mysterious. I would recommend it to anyone who likes an adventure/mystery book.
4,Couldn't put it down,The Devil's Cradle is an excellent book. I've read the first book and was looking forward to reading this one... and wasn't disappointed. I was kept on the edge of my seat almost the whole time.
4,Nancy Drew Lovers....Adult Version of her mysteries,This is my second book by this author. I could hardly put it down. Very realistic and not full of sex scenes. It is very wholesome.
3,"Romantic, gentle and soothing lyrics.","This is the first time I listen to David Cassidy's songs. The lyrics are romantic, gentle and soothing The sound quality of the DVD is so so because the volume is very low. The picture quality is average. He has some very lovely songs. I found most of the music are monotonous and sounds almost the same!"
1,Too Expensive for Paperback,"I agree with the other reviewer. The price for this paperback printing, new and used, is ridiculous."
1,Gift? Not so much!,"I suffer from depression and hoped this book would do for me what the other reviewers state, and the cover promised. Nothing could have been further from my experience. As someone who does fear what my depression may hold for me in the future, the first two stories, about someone who ultimately killed himself, and another who also feared the future, I was terribly depressed. The book simply killed any hope I had. I REFUSE to read any more, and I will not donate or share it, but destroy it."
1,embarrasing,"This is such a cheesey dvd I couldn't believe it. I was laughing. I couldn't even finish it because it was sooo bad. It is not yoga, it is not kickboxing. I sold it at the used book store. If you want a respectable fusion that is not Richard Simmonesque try Cameron Shayne's Budokon."
1,Tiny Bites is a Tiny Book,"I was looking forward to the arrival of Tiny Bites. Imagine my disappointment when a book not much larger than my children's Golden Books arrived ... and not written any better than said Golden Books as well.The first part of the book is mostly technical, explaining only two types of Gastric Bypass surgery. The rest of the book is a series of individuals stories. An effort was made to have a story about a number of different people ... each one with a different result post-operatively. However, they seemed contrived and I didn't feel as if I was learning anything factual.All in all I was VERY disappointed in the book. I found more information of value using the Google Search engine. My advice if you REALLY want to buy it ... buy it used and save some money."
1,First WLS Book purchase,"I was disappointed when I received my copy of this publication. For the cost, I expected more pages and content."
1,Dry/ Literal/ Without depth...Other than that....I LOVED it!,"This is the WORST translation of this esteemed and astonishingly accurate oracle that I have known - and I've seen some ticky-tacky versions...Why is it so bad, you may ask??? Well, it seems to take a literal and not a spiritual viewpoint of the text, as well as the fact that it has no ""juice"" for me... Oh, and did I mention the classic chauvanistic bent? There's that, too. Go pick up the classic Bollingen edition, by Wilhelm/Baynes, or ""The Everyday I Ching"", by Sarah Dening, or the one by Wu Wei, or another by Lauren David Peden, or the Joseph Murphy version, or the ""I Ching Workbook"" by R. L. Wing"", or the enjoyable and easily understood version by the Sorrells, called ""an idiot's guide to the i ching"".Almost... ANYTHING...but the Legge. VAV, Kentucky"
3,Contrived or honest?,"It seems like Paul is trying too hard to be genuine.If you like his previous solo stuff, you'll like this. But there aren't any major developments in his sound or themes here.Songs ending abruptly because the tape ran out? Feels contrived and weak. Too image conscious. In striving for a casual rocker's honesty, Paul forces the issue with ridiculous statements in the liner notes that sound like they were written by a angst-ridden teen.The Mono disc beats the Stereo disc hands down."
5,Late Replacements - Revisited,"Paul Westerberg, the genesis of The Replacements. He has come around, raw with the real feel of the later replacemetns shows. But...not to offend, Paul, more so. This collection of tunes has opened a door into the world of PW. His performance along with the rest is the best. Flat out I recommed this CD to anyone. If you don't know who the replacements are or who Paul Westerberg is but have always wondered what Kurt Kobain MIGHT sound like had he made it to 40...then give this a listen.The master PW srings in with a winner!!!"
4,"Not ""14 Songs"", but....","This is pure honest music. His solo debut ""14 Songs"" is, in my opinion, his best. ""Stereo"" is good old-fashioned sit about the fire, home-cooking. Completely honest in writing, mistakes, performance. If you're looking for slick production, listen to the radio. It doesn't get any more human than this."
2,what happened to this guy?,"i dont know if it was the booze that fueled the genius that was the replacements but this guy has done nothing but go downhill since they broke up a decade ago. his first cd ""14 songs"" was a little uneven but still had interesting melodies and lyrics. each album since then has disappointed me and his current one is no exception. all the songs on ""mono"" sound the same to me and formulaic at best. ""grandpaboy"" at least rocks a little bit but it too suffers from sounding forced and repetitive. i sincerely hope that the replacement reform and the anarchy and rawness that was their trademark returns. i cant stand another solo album from this guy. i expect too much from him."
3,All Shook Down Redux,"Another disappointing solo release from former Replacements front man, Paul Westerberg. Given the innovation and sheer genius of recordings like ""Hootenanny"" and ""Let It Be,"" one can barely believe the same songwriter and instrumentalist is at work here. The ""chances"" taken aren't smart chances. At it's worst, ""Stereo"" sounds like outtakes from ""Suicaine Gratifaction,"" his most tentative and awkward release. ""Grandpaboy"" bonus disc fares better, but repeated listenings reveal it to be the equal of an outtake disc from the 'Mats spotty ""All Shook Down."" Still, there are moments of gleeful, giddy up rock 'n' roll on Grandpaboy disc, from a man who once showed so much promise. Westerberg is still better than most. A sad reflection on the state of music in the States."
1,didnt like it-wish i could take it back,"i was expecting something better than what i got. i thought his guitar playing was mediocre and his vocals were hard to listen to. someone said his guitar playing was like ""a knife fight in a telephone booth""...it was more like a thumb wrestling match at the superdome. im sorry people, but this cd is terrible. i was a victim of great advertising. a bluesmaster he is not."
4,Still crazy after all these years.,"Few things in the world of popular music are real and true and good anymore, but listening to Stereo/Mono reminded me of what it's like to find something that is. Thanks Paul. It's nice to know you're still around."
4,Back to the basement's of Minneapolis,"The new release of Westerberg brings back the Westerberg of ""Sorry Ma"" and ""Let it Be"". Sure, the music may be a little more mature (maybe) but this album brings back the unpolished yet powerful music that drew many of us to clubs in the mid 80's. The Replacements, Westerberg, and most of the rest of rock (and society?) found producers as the 90's approached and soon production became as important as the music itself. The popularity of bands such as the Strokes and Weezer, however, as well as the resurgence in popularity of bands such as the Clash and Velvet Underground suggests that cravings for rock in its most raw forms do exist and people are looking for music to satisfy the urge. Westerberg, by returning to his own roots, supplies a small, but very satisfying, way to help the rest of us return to ours."
5,Rock and Roll blood and gore at its finest,"I dunno nothing about the Replacements, but this is one of the most desperate pieces of Rock and Roll I've ever heard-- grit and grime just pouring out of this guy, and he's powerless to stop it. Also, PW here demonstrates precisely why the good Lord created the electric guitar: for savage abuse in the service of creating rock and roll music. Both discs are absolutely out of control. Muchas gracias, amigo."
5,Genius,"The Replacements were the best rock band of the 80s. And I don't apologize for saying so.Paul Westerberg's solo work has been pretty spotty, but this double CD release really manages to capture some of that Replacements magic from the early 80s. Not an easy feat by any means."
4,The New Glory Days,"As a Replacements fan since the first time I saw them at the Rat in Boston, circa '83, I've gotta say this is the best Westerberg release since the last Replacements' record. I think the two albums must be taken as a whole. We get a snapshot into Westerberg's basement during the last two years. Standouts include the strangely Steve Earl-like ""Don't Want Never"", ""Boring Enormous"",""2 Days 'Til Tomorrow"" and ""AAA"" which, despite other reviews, offers the strangely comforting message for all us Replacements' fans""I Do't Have Anything, to say to Anyone,Anymore"". My only criticism is that the 4 weakest songs open the ""Stereo"" portion of Westerberg's ""Sandinista""."
4,Terrific,"This is a terrific album by legendary singer/songwriter Paul Westerberg. Stereo is very much like Suicaine, but the songs are much catchier which ultimately makes this a much more satisfying album. I hate to say it but I listened to Suicaine four or five times and it has sat on the shelf ever since. I haven't been able to stop spinning this one yet!Mono is very catchy, very fun, would be excellent if produced."
5,The Best and The Easiest!!!!,"I have followed so many diets - to many to even mention!!But, The Fat Attack Plan - is fantastic - almost a nobrainer!!I have been following it for some time and have managedto keep my weight off. It just makes so much sense and is easy to follow."
3,An Interesting read,A good view of cultures and the ensuing issues of people of other lands. An opportunity to learn about another's culture and one's candid view of it.
2,Fair playing but awful sound.,"It's hard to exaggerate how bad the sound is on this CD. Even though it's digital, this live concert sounds like it was recorded with a cheap tape player. Coupled with the fact that the playing is rough in some places, this CD is not recommended."
1,One star because zero stars was not an option,I made it to page 150 of Haunted and almost threw the book away. My wife decided she'd give it a shot and didn't make it as far as I did. This book truly stinks. If it gets scary at some point you'll likely never know it because the ridiculous romance will be so off putting that you too will feel foolish for having bought the book.No kidding. Go find an old Casper the Ghost comic before you buy this terrible thing. How did this get published?Wow!Oh! Heather? By the way. C14 dating doesn't apply to artifacts that are 100 years old. At least try to get the science straight.
2,"big on ""romantic"", low on ""thriller""","This is the first novel by Ms. Graham that I've read, and will be the last. Thinking it would be a horror thriller with some romance aspect I was disappointed to find it was much more a romance novel with the pretense of a haunted house thriller as a plot vehicle. I kept thinking it might improve along the way, but no, unfortunately it led to the predictable ending I anticipated. And if I read the phrase, so-and-so ""arched a brow at"" one more time I was going to scream aloud!Overall, an unimpressive book that I would not recommend to thriller or horror readers at all."
5,A Coherent and Intriguing Story Indeed,"Haunted is the first Heather Graham book I read and I was immediately thrilled to read the whole story after reading the first few pages. It was a perfect read: the haunted house mood is just what I wanted, and the characters are affectionate. The story is intriguing in that connections are drawn from past, present, to future, which is very difficult to write, but the writer managed it so well, making the story so coherent that a flaw is yet to be found. I would recommend this book to readers who are entertained by a constant suspenseful plot."
4,Loved it!!,"This is the fourth book by Heather Graham that I've read regarding her ""supernatural"" series and I have to say that I like this one the best. It follows a small-town sheriff named Matt Stone who hires a paranormal psychic investigator named Darcy to stay at his southern bed and breakfast when ""ghost"" activity scares a few maids and houseguests off. He doesn't believe in spirits and thinks Darcy is many things, including a fraud, despite her beauty and demeanor. They don't get a long and the tension between them builds until it hits a cresendo. There is a murder-mystery that is fun to read and try to guess whodunit and overall, the story is enjoyable."
2,Needs editing,"I received this book as a gift. It was okay, but nothing I would buy and I wouldn't read anything by this author again. There were multiple word errors throughout the book--things that spell check wouldn't catch because they were actual words, just not the right words. And some of the conversations between characters flat out didn't make sense because the writing was so flowery and garbled. I think it could have been about 100 pages shorter and been much better."
5,Love it!!!,Her books are the first that I have that isn't a children's book category at all. I love it and now I'm completing here Harrison Investigation series books.
5,Great haunted house story,"I really like Heather Graham's paranormal stories, especially the ones with characters from the fictional Harrison Investigations. While haunted house stories have been done over and over again, Heather Graham puts a different twist to it, which is one of the reasons why it's a great page-turner book. All in all, I highly recommend this book."
3,A FAN,"This book had a really good story line, the only problem was the way it was written. It didnt flow very well and it was hard to figure out who was speaking at a paticular time. I'm a fan of hers and like the haunted house idea. She does a good job describing characters and places. At the begining of the book, I almost stopped reading. However, it does get better by the middle."
3,Good read overall....but...,"Haunted actually gave me a few chills here and there. Great characters and story. Really good mystery. It won't bore you too much, until the extended sex dialog. There are atleast of couple pages of each sex scene. That may not sound bad, but that's two pages of, ""then he felt her here and there as she moaned..blah..blah..blah"". Not very interesting. I could see a little but pages?...c'mon. Anyways...awsome read, characters, and ending."
2,"weak story, underdeveloped characters",This book started out pretty good and then falls completely flat. The characters are so underdeveloped that I felt no emotion for them at all. The sex scenes felt completely out of place within the story. The ending wasn't exciting or worth waiting for.
2,Boring,"The characters just didn't have the substance to hold my attention. At first, the plot and characters had so much potentional that I hoped this book would grab me, but it just never made it. The story was very tedious, predictable, no sparks and the subcharacters were silly and flighty. I gave it two stars only because of the potentional. I love Heather Graham's books written as Shannon Drake. However, as Heather Graham, her writing is passive / boring. This is not my first, but will be my last book to read of Heather Graham."
2,The book keeps you at endge,I was disappointed to find that the next to last chapter explains the story. The story was good until you think it's one persons and not and then it goes all over the place. Not like the books I've read in the past. Blah
3,Entertaining enough .. but no real 'meat',"I really enjoyed reading this book and I did finish it in two days, but I couldn't help but think there was some real decent 'meat' missing here. And although we're used to the 2 main characters being flat-out model-types--here not only were the heroine and hero 'gorgeous' but it seems the whole damn ranch was oozing with unbelievably handsome men. (WHERE is this place?) In real life-you'd only see this gathering of models on a red carpet. Matt Stone was a bit of a pill, some places unnecessarily just plain MEAN! (I'd have been outta there if someone treated ME that way---why did she stay???) Anyway, I recommend it as an entertaining read at the beach or a stormy night. :-)"
2,Not the best-,"I tried to read this and get thru it, but the book lost my interest in about three quarters of the way in-This book is about a physic Darcy who has to go to a Civil War bed and breakfast, because a ghost is hauting the mansion. She meets the owner, and has a hate, then love relationship with him.The character Matt Stone, was alittle too brusk for me, and he just seemed like a jerk, and I was sort of aggrivated by theaffair that Darcy and Jack tried to have.sorry"
3,Reacher,"I ordered this for my husband to replace one that he received from the hoapital several years ago. I works fine except that there is no way to hook it onto his walker. There is a clip on the side but it is too narrow to easily clip on the walker. His other reacher had a hook at the top that was very convenient to use to hook it on the walker. He complains all the time that he left it ""in the other room"". I am still looking for one with that hook at the top."
1,An Antebellum Platation Household,"I was very disappointed in this book. I expected much more information regarding daily life . I was annoyed by the author's interruptions and her naive statements such as ""there were no antibiotics in l864. Well, of course not! The intelligent reader know when antibiotics were inroduced. This book read like a term paper, and that annoyed me."
4,Kids Love It!!!,I work with struggling readers and have difficulty finding books with very high interest and low reading level. This book worked like a charm for my students. They were devouring it and even asked if they could borrow one of my classroom set books to take home after we finished reading it. The recipe at the end is also a great lesson for following directions!!!
1,Not age appropriate,"This may be a well written book, but when my son brought it home from his Kindergarden library I am honestly astonished at what is being allowed to be read! The rating on this book states ages 4-8. My son is 5 and frankly I think he is still too young. It talks about different animals ""mating"" and the disgusting things that it explains about the animals is too much for little ears!!"
5,The perfect male summer reading escape,"With so many authors aiming for your wife's interests, it's great to finally have a novel written for a male's summer reading enjoyment. The book is an excellent summer escape -- it will take you back to long ago times that still seem so near and will keep you hopeful about the future. If you're a fan of Greene's columns or you just want to feel better about life, then you have to read this book!"
5,A Great Escape,"I stumbled upon Bob Greene's All Summer Long a couple of years ago when I read his ""Hang Time"" book about Michael Jordan. The subject matter of several friends putting everything aside for a Summer and roadtriping around the country has always been appealing to me and this story didn't disappoint. Although this is a fictional account, you really feel as if the author is recanting a journey that he actually took. I found myself really wanting to do something like this someday as well. I highly recommend this book."
3,Greene Covering Familiar Material,"As someone who loved ""Be True To Your School"" and liked ""You Know You Should Be Glad"", I was disappointed.This is a novel, which to me is fiction. But Greene covers the same material as he does in the two books mentioned above. Bristol is Bexley and his friends are the same as in the other two books. Either you take away the novel label or you disguise the characters a lot better. That thought stayed with me through the entire book.Bob is a few years older than me and his vanilla world and mid-life crisis struck me as navel-gazing after a while. Still, he is a good writer which made the book bearable."
4,Nice print but expensive to operate,"This uses 5 laser cartridges. When you run out of a color, it stops. You cannot get any more life out of a cartridge by shaking to redistribute the toner. You cannot opt to print anyway. Hence, if you need copies in a hurry for a meeting and you happen to be the one using the printer when it runs out, you have to stop and insert the new cartridge right then and there. These cartridges are expensive. The print is good, but then again, that is because you get so little life out of the cartridges."
2,not much about the logic of measurement,"There's a lot of history in this book, but little analysis. He doesn't even provide analyses of specialized forms of measurement, let alone put forth an attempt to analyze the concept. And, while he obviously knows the history, he doesn't do much to show how it relates to contemporary science."
1,I had to read it for a class,"This book was mostly boring with a few interesting items thrown in here and there. I suppose if I cared about all the millions of different measurements all over the world and how many of one equals how many of another, it might have been interesting. However, I have been trying to read all 700 pages for the last month and am not even half way through it."
1,Watch out!,"This winder looks like a great design - until you actually use it! It winds up fine, the problem is that when you let the kite out, if there is a strong gust of wind and you lose control of the winding knob, the line begins to spin out really fast. This makes the knobs rotate incredibly fast (they turn into a blur), and the only way to stop the line going out is to stick your hand into the Rotating Spindle of Death. It hurts, even for an adult, and it almost made my 12 year old cry - it hurt that much. So if you're a masochist, go for it, otherwise avoid this winder like the plague!"
1,The Worst Mortgage Product on the Market,"In the fewest words, spend your money elsewhere. His products are the biggest misleading ripoffs that I have ever purchased in my eight year mortgage history. When I challenged the gurantee, ""if you open the package it's yours to keep!"" Why offer a gurantee if you are not going to honor it? Misleading marketing? The contents of this material are so basic yet they call them advanced, not even close! Save your money spend it on some of the better gurus in our mortgage industry that have a proven record and their materials carry a genuine gurantee (remember good materials hardly ever get returned). See gurus like Dave Hershman, LoanToolBox.com, Brian Pert, ByReferralOnly, or Karen Deis."
1,A waste of time!,"Don't dare spend money on this crap. As a matter of fact, don't even watch it for free. It was a total disappointment. We had to turn it off after to trying to sit through several horrible comedians."
1,BEWARE,"I read on the internet the killers were going to put out a dvd this year and I bought this dvd thinking this was it, but it is not (or at least I hope it isn't). It isn't even authorized by them nor does it contain any orginal music by the killers. In fact it seems to be a repackaging of the Leaving Las Vegas dvd. The first five minutes has the same intro. I was so disappointed I didn't watch anymore than that. I love the killers and the rating no way reflects on them or their music. Don't waste your money, especially if you already have the Leaving Las Vegas dvd (read the reviews for it if you don't)."
2,Jewel is about the most beautiful woman in the world!,"First off, I love Jewel but this CD is really weird. Jewel was only 19 when this was recorded and maybe that part of the problem! It contains some songs from her first album but also contains rarities (oddities) like ""God's Gift to Women"", ""Race Car Driver"" and ""Flower"". The songs show some potential but you can see Jewel wasn't fully formed yet. Her work would get so much better. In fact, I've heard great live versions of ""Race Car Driver"" but this demo version is really out there. I assume she was trying to be funny. ""Flower"" would have fit nicely on ""Pieces of You"" but ""God's Gift to Women"" is not her style at all. Overall, not a good promo release to showcase the artist's potential."
5,Excellent CB Antenna,Great CB antenna. I combined it with the Midland 75-822 in my car and they work perfectly in combination. I did need to tune the antenna slightly by choking the rod up and down slightly to get the best setting on my SWR meter but it was so close that you could have used the antenna out of the box without damaging your receiver.
1,K-30 Antenna - N/G,"I purchased this antenna to replace a K-40 that failed. I cannot get a good SWR match, ended up cutting an inch or so off the antenna and still not a good match. It has low receive and minimal transmit capabilities. I have a Uniden radio with weather; I cannot receive most weather stations like I received with the K-40. DO NOT BUY THIS ANTENNA."
5,yep it works,Did a lil quick research before I bought this for use during a Jeep Jamboree Stayed right where I put it on my front bumper and never came loose even through mud ad brush.
2,Good for hand held but not for mobile units,This antenna was very difficult to use with anything over 4 Watts (the legal limit). The SWR reading on both of the K30's I bought was 2-3 which is not very good for an antenna. I would suggest getting the K40 magnet mount or a firestick instead. If you are using a hand held and looking for an antenna this would be the one to get. It works great with my Radio Shack and Midland hand held CB's. Just not very good for anything with power behind it.
5,Excellent performance.,"Didn't want the taller and more expensive K-40, opting instead for the cheaper and shorter K-30 for my Ford pickup. Reception is excellent and anyone I can hear can hear me. Low profile look that won't take away from your vehicle. Am very happy with the product and can recommend it."
5,Very Good Antenna,I am new to the CB world and bought this antenna based on reviews. It is a fine antenna. Build quality is very nice and so is the appearance. So far the farthest I have communicated with it was roughly 5 miles. I did have to trim the whip a bit to get the SWR where I needed it. The SWR on 1 and 40 is around 1.4 and on channel 19 my meter hits a perfect 1.
2,Good Book with a Glaring Omission,"There are excellent guidelines in this book. If you purchase it, you will be getting good information except for one very important area which appears to be completely overlooked. In today's grant market, you must know how to design good outcome measures. The concepts of goals and objectives come into play here (and are addressed in the book), but the buzz words are ""outcome measures"". I wish the authors had included a chapter or two on designing outcomes measures for both project oriented grants and for general operating grants (which are by far the harder to design).The information here is good. It is easy to understand and, from my experience as a full time grant writer, right on the mark. Just know you will have to attend a workshop or find another place to learn about outcome measures."
4,Worth the money,"I am an intermediate grantseeker who hoped to find a book that would assist me in further honing my writing. This book did just that. It is concise yet substantial and provided me with a fresh approach that will be useful for years to come. The language is intelligent (the authors steer clear of trite, 'inspirational' language), clear, and honest. I suggest this book for anyone interested in the grantseeking process."
5,The Best,I have a huge library of Grant Seeking and Managing books. I purchased this one recently and was amazed...it's the BEST! I have since bought all of Cheryl Carter New and Jame Aaron Quick's Grant books. I now use them for every grant I put together. When I discuss the Grant world with the Non-Profits and Governments I work with I use the material found in their books almost exclusively. If you are new to the Grant world these are the first books you should purchase.
3,well-written steps to follow,"In recently conducted grant workshops for teachers this guide was most helpful.For future workshops-- for educators applying for grants in their field, another title might be more appropriate and targeted to needs of educators. Educators usually have an RFP in hand and this book is helpful to find funding ....which isn't always the educator's focus at that moment."
1,Delsey,"Bought this suitcase to take to Europe where I spent 8 weeks this summer. Rollers seldom rolled straight. Felt like I was carrying a bale of hay with me all summer. One of the rollers finally stuck completely. On trip home another of the wheels completely snapped off. Could have blamed this on airline, but didn't notice until I arrived home (since it wouldn't roll anyway). Contacted Delsey who sent me to their local repair facility. Was accused in front of others by these insensible people of trying to defraud Delsey. Totally embarrassed so just gave up. Only paid $100.00 or so for it, but really didn't expect it to be pure junk."
1,Wheels are useless,"This is an attractive, elegant case but the wheel design is AWFUL. Unlike those on rival products, the spinner wheels simply do not work. It's impossible to pull this bag behind you. On hard and carpeted surfaces, the wheels often refuse to align with the direction of travel and, instead, skid along sideways. After dragging this thing 1/4 mile on pavement, I was exhausted and one of the wheel housings was worn away. If you try pushing it on all four wheels, the wheels catch every surface irregularity and the bag wanders. Like another reviewer said, this thing has a mind of its own ... a very sick mind. What a shame! The rest of the design is really nice but what use is a wheeled bag that doesn't wheel?"
2,Could Really Use Better Wheels,"Have used it on a few trips during the 3 years I have had it. Have liked its size and some of the features, but will never buy it again because of the poor wheel design. The wheels have never rolled properly. One got worn out because of sliding instead of rolling and had to be replaced about a year back. Now on the last trip, the material attaching the wheel to the rest of the suitcase started to come off."
5,A King's Review,"The king has struck again. He has created havoc in his kingdom by creating too many commissioners. He has commissioners for foul balls, rainy days,and counting to name a few. The time comes when he must count how many commissioners he has. He calls on his counting commissioners who begin the long task. His daughter the princess helps count as well. Each person counts a different way to please the King but he can only follow the logic of one. That person is....... buy the book! This book is a great read for many ages and can be used in and out of school."
5,Blackboard,the blackboard is an excellent tool and very much worth it. it adds some fun and the kids pay attention to the messages left better than using the white dry erase board.
3,Cornelio Reyna,"This album is ok. It contains some ""Banda"" selections I don't particularly care for but otherwise it is an ok cd."
3,Interesting but you still need to do alot more,"Don't think that by reading this book that you will close the last page go out there and start inspecting homes.YOu need alot more information and you will need to read alot more books and do some proper training. However the book is an interesting read and you will get a few ideas on what you should do. it advises to get some interpersonal skills if you do not already have them. So I went and bought a few books on that, and it cost me over 30. But Im pretty sure it will help.The book explains the different types of reports and abit about marketing, actually it flirts with all the aspects but does no get too deep.Overall, its worth a read but just don't bank on starting up when you put it down."
3,OK,"Helpful, but not very in-depth with the specific inspection procedures. Was lookinjg for more of a technical manual."
1,Deceit,This is in no way related to disney at all. Don't waste your $$$$... I was so looking forward to the real thing
1,Not the real thing,The price was too good to be true...I would recommend you do not bother buying...it is obviously not the real thing!
1,Not Disney,"Unfortunately, I didn't check the other reviews. This is not the Disney version. I would recommend that you not purchase this item."
2,Used to be 4 star--hardly squeaks now,"Not sure what JW Pet company has done with these toys, but there is very poor quality control on the functionality of the squeaker. They used to squeak easily and loudly. Now, you squeeze and there's no squeak. Let up on the squeeze and there's a faint little blip of a squeak. My pugs LOVE these, but they also love to hear the squeak. I don't like to buy these online now because I have to test them out before I buy. I went to three pet stores tonight, and of all of them only one of the 10 cuz balls had a decent squeak. This is for both the ""good"" and ""bad"" (one with the little devil horns) cuz balls."
3,Lasted only 2 days,My 9 months old wired fox terrier; Dasher loves this toy but it only last 2 days. Dasher has bitten off both legs. Got to watch out in case your pet swallowed the legs.. He loves the queaking sound it made.
2,"good idea, bad construction","I had a large one of these for one of my dogs and she loved it. I bought a small one from Pet Smart for my shih tzu and he also loved it. He went nuts when I squeaked it and loved chewing on the feet. Unfortunately he chewed out the squeaker after a couple of days. I luckily got the squeaker before he could eat it but let him continue to play with the ball. The next day I noticed the rubber was cracking or splitting in various spots. I realized that the one we had before (maybe a different brand?) had the squeaker on the under side of the ball, between the feet. I believe he wouldn't have been able to chew out the squeaker if it was covered by the feet. The only reason I gave this two stars is because my dog loves it so much. I had to take it away from him because I was afraid he would rip it to shreds and consume it when I wasn't around but I still catch him looking around for it."
2,Beware of the feet,"Our dog absolutely loved this toy -- it was her favorite toy. BUT it is potentially dangerous toy and in fact was dangerous to our dog. The ball and the feet are made of a very hard, durable rubber. Our dog chewed one of the feet off of the ball and swallowed it. The foot became lodged in her intestines and had to be surgically removed. The blockage or surgery could have killed her (and may still do so -- she had the surgery yesterday and is still not out of the woods). This is a really durable squeaky ball for any dog, but I recommend that you cut off the feet before you let your dog chew on it. I realize that this could happened with other products but in four years this is the only foreign object our dog has swallowed to our knowledge and it was a close call."
3,Cockerspaniel Killed it Within 30 min,"Sigh.. not good for medium dogs. I have a cockerspaniel and he killed the squeeker within 30min by pushing in the squeeker. I was able to pop it out, but by the 2nd week it was just dead...This is good for small dogs and puppies."
5,Great Product!,I have a black lab puppy that LOVES to chew on everything. Most toys are destroyed within a few days (the exception is her Kong). This toy is super sturdy and squeeks which she loves! She did chew off the feet but ball still works great!
2,Dog could care less,"I got this toy because I thought my dog would like it and it would be durable. The there doesn't seem to be a good size for my dog- it is either so small that I worry about her swallowing it, or pulling out the squeaker. The toy seems too heavy for her, and she is generally disinterested. I was surprised because my dog loves squeaky toys and balls. I would expect that there are plenty of dogs that would love to have this toy, but it's just not for my boston terrier.One thing I should warn about is the squeaker. It seems like it may brake easily with moderate chewing, so you need to be aware of it and make sure your dog doesn't eat it."
5,"Dog Loves it, Usually",This was at one point my dog's absolute favorite. He has recently begun to prefer tennis ball sized toys (I have the large) but then this comes in smaller sizes. It's also held up as well as anything else has - and I have quite a chewer.
2,dissapointingly short lived!,"Within an hour of receiving this toy, my jack russell had chewed the feet off... by the next day, it had a hole in it and the 'squeaky' was gone. I have thrown the toy away."
5,super tough,"Love JW toys. This guy is super tough and lasts FOREVER!! Takes a beating by TWO GSDs daily. The only thing is, the squeaker falls into the toy right away with such big dogs constantly squeaking it."
4,"Not as durable as advertised, but an ok toy","My lab/pitbull mix loves this toy... He had ripped the feet off in less than 2 minutes! So I cut the feet off, and it's a great toy as a ball. However, it makes the most irritating noise so it is only an outside toy now. Good for aggressive chewers, as long as you cut off the feet first. Really LOUD and annoying noise, but my pup loves it!"
2,My puppy chewed feet off in ten minutes,"I picked this up for my 6 month old Golden mix puppy. I bought the large size because it felt so much more heavy-duty than the medium size. However, once I got it home, my puppy had both feet chewed to bits in a matter of minutes. Not only that, but the parts came off in small pieces which made me worry that she could choke on it. I was surprised because in the store it felt strong and well-made. I would not recommend for a strong-chewer. I returned it the very next day and received a refund."
3,Bailey likes it,"This is a good toy especially for the price.The pro's:1) its inexpensive2) it bounces weird (makes for a fun fetch toy)3) it has a good squeaker4) plastic seems pretty durableCons:1) I would not get this for a large dog, it is pretty small, and could possibly be swallowedThat's the toy in a nutshell. I needed 3 more dollars to get free shipping, and this product was the perfect product at the price I needed. Would I spend more than $5.00 on it? Nope, just a regular squeaker toy, but it is pretty durable, and Bailey likes it just fine.UPDATE JANUARY 9th, 2012:squeaker broke this past week, so it lasted us all of 2 weeks :(Still at 3 dollar it is okay, but of all the Christmas toys (including treats) this has lasted the least amount of time.This toy is better than dollar tree squeakers (they will last us less than an hour) but of all her squeakers not bought at dollar tree this has given out the quickest. I don't regret that I bought it, but I will probably not buy it again."
3,I ordered the large ball because...,"I knew it would be hard for my dog (Lab/Pit Bull) to get his mouth completely around it. I read the other reviews about the feet being chewed off, and needing to watch your pet while they are playing with this ball. That is exactly what my dog did, chew the feet off! Fortunately he did not swallow the pieces, but he does not find this ball as exciting as I had hoped."
2,Great product except it doesn't squeek!,I had one of these already and my chihuahua loved it. I lost his original one and ordered this replacement but was bummed to find out the new one didn't squeek!It's hard to get my dogs attention and the fact that this toy didn't sqeek was a big dissapointment. Otherwise it would have been perfect.
2,"Good Cuz, not so good for us","My girl is a hard chewer, so I taught this toy would be tough enough for her. The first day she managed to chew of quite enough pieces from the legs. So, I cut of the legs from the Cuz and gave her the ball. The ball was not chewed, but unfortunately, she lost interest in it immediately."
2,Doesn't squeak.,These are my dog's favorite toy and the reason she likes them so much is bc the squeaker doesn't wear out.This one doesn't squeak at all...
1,Dead on Arrival,All five toys arrived in non-working condition. A manufacturing defect resulted in extra holes punched in the toy so that not one would squeak (you could only get them to squeak if you covered the extra hole with your finger and then squeezed the toy. The dogs were not inclined to do this and were not interested in a non-squeaking toy). It's not worth paying to pack these things up to send them back. Buyer beware; a defective product.
1,terrible quality,My 3 month old puppy (ie still tiny puppy teeth) ripped the feet off within 5 minutes. Awful quality of rubber and would not buy again.
1,Destructable - COMPLETELY!,"Our Australian Shepherd/Lab mix got this on Christmas morning and by 4pm that afternoon, Good Cuz's feet were gone! Yes, GONE! She rarely destroys anything and if she does, she's had it for many months, not just a few hours. BEWARE - this item doesn't last long at all! Now, can she still play with it..yes but it definitely has lost it's ""cute"" factor."
4,Our beagle/border collie mix loves this toy,"Everytime we've purchased a squeaker toy, it was destroyed immediately. This one has last the longest and its been a week. The squeaker is very loud, louder than most, but she loves it. She wears herself out just by playing with it. I love it and will purchase again. jc"
2,Not very good,We wanted to get this ball for our Shi Tzu as he loved the one we got from a pet store. Well the same day we got it and gave it to him it quit squeaking. The piece kept falling out if the hole in the back so it doesn't squeak and it had some kind of white powder in it and reeked bad. Don't go cheap but the one at the pet stores.
2,2 stars for 2 days,"my german shepherd loved the toy for 2 days, then the squeaker popped into the ball and he doesn't want to play with it anymore! he isn't much of a chewer either."
1,Poorly written and boring,"This is probably the worst book I have ever had the displeasure to read. Bought this before going to Philadelphia and had trouble getting through any chapter given the author's boring style. Half of the reviews were wrong in my opinion and the other half of the places rated as good were closed (looks like diners got to vote him wrong before I did). Save your money and avoid this book and any places in it, this guy has no clue"
1,Below One Star,"Ridiculed by the Philadelphia restaurant scene for his lack of understanding of food and social retard personality, Craig LaBan faces being chased out of Philadelphia like he was out of New Orleans by Emeril Lagasse. The changing ownership to Brian Tierney of the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper understands a book that does not sell, like this one, means a column that does not sell like Craig LaBan's weekly tripe. The book will be a good memory of what went wrong with Craig LaBan as he closes out his career in the Detroit ghetto he grew up in forming his dysfunctional tastes and elementary prose. His opinion means nothing, other than a good laugh. Make the cut quick Brian Tierney so you can make money finally with advertising and real readers. Skip this book, it's the worst seller and complete waste of money."
3,"Not a ""how-to"" guide for twirling","I have been unsuccessfully trying to find a book on how to twirl. When I saw this book I bought it, but the chapter on twirling is not ""how-to"" twirl, but rather a list of resources on twirling costumes, equipment, competitions and organizers, etc. If that's what you want, than great, but don't expect twirling lessons."
3,"Nice, but eventually disposable","I got these about two months ago. They's so cute, and they really do keep water from sloshing down your gloves. But now the cuffs have ripped off, and the gloves themselves have started to disentegrate. They are just rubber gloves, no matter how you decorate them."
5,Ellis-Elvis - I'll Remember You,"Great CD!! Jimmy Ellis' voice was a natural phenomenon. It is so pure, crisp, rasp (when he wanted) deep from the gut - just like Elvis. Actually he could sing certain songs better than E - and I'm an Elvis fan. He just had that once in a century talent like Sinatra, Engelbert, Tom Jones, and Elvis -- but he was never given the deserved recognition for it by radio who thought he was an impersonator - which he was NOT! For more, visit the official site at: www.orionjimmyellis.com"
2,Poor Quality DVD's,"I was so thrilled when I came across these DVD's and even more thrilled when I saw it had the movie I had been endlessly searching for ""Time of our Lives"". I had gotten it a few months ago as a Christmas presnet for my grandparents. Could not wait to give it to them. Well, X-mas passed, we went to watch the first disc and it had visible marks on the DVD as well as skips through out 3 of the movies so far. SO bummed... I obviously didn't open them up until after xmas... and it had been longer 2 months since purchased, so can't return or exchange now :( SOOO disappointed!! They are brand new, so I don't get how so much damage was done to the discs??? Just beware/cautious I guess... Best of luck tho!!!"
4,Time of their Lives,I got this DVD for the movie about the American Revolution. I saw it when I was a little kid on tv one night and thought it was great and a fun twist of ghosts and the American Revolution. I enjoyed it.
2,Abbott and Costello volume 2,"The first 6 titles are great, but missing the last two titles on back of disc 2. Just get no disc when I try to play it. Buck private come home and Wistful Widow of the WagonGap are the missing movies. Brought for Buck privates go home and Naughty nineties. One out of two not to bad, I guess. Please check your dvds when you recieve them. If you wait to long no warranty.The Best of Abbott & Costello, Vol. 2 (Hit the Ice / In Society / Here Come the Co-Eds / The Naughty Nineties / Little Giant / The Time of Their Lives / Buck Privates Come Home / The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap)"
3,DVD issues,"I don't understand how a DVD is made. If a film is transfered to a DVD why would the DVD freeze the image? Why would you be able to hear the voices and not be able to see the images? This DVD was not the best. I love the comedy of Abbot and Costello, but am very disappointed that there were so many issues with the DVD. I bought it for the Baseball Routine and couldn't even see it. Not happy with the product."
5,finally found it,"I have been searching for The time of thier lives for decades. Finally found it on this multi movie. such a great movie, couldnt figure out why so many people didnt know of it."
5,Best Comedy classics,"Abbott&Costello are one of the best comedy acts ever tied with The Three Stooges and The Marx Brothers. This collection some of their best and classic films, which are The Naughty Nineties, Time of Their Lives and Buck Privates Come Home. The first two didn't seem like their all films, due to them having more focus on other characters then Abbott&Costello. All movies are in Black&White and are in Full Screen formant. I was also impressed on how great quality the video was and all the movies played fine with no problem at all. This is a must have for any fan of Comedies or a fan of Abbott&Costello and I would defiantly recommend this to anyone."
2,The Best of Abbott & Costello,3 out of 4 videos worked great but the other video would not start. I contacted the seller with 2 emails but got no response. I would be wary on buying any more videos from Amazon
3,About the Abbot & Costello Collection; vol. 2 & 3,"The Abott & Costello movies were just as I had remembered them - great fun . I do wish however , that they would put the discs in better packaging - the cardboard and very thin plastic are very cheap and don'tprotect the discs well . I also wish we could get better collections - in""the good old days"" studios had actors under contracts - and put them inmany second-rate productions - known as ""B"" movies which were shown withthe film everyone came to see . This team made many movies like that - I just don't like to have to buy clinkers in order to get 2 or 3 I want."
4,abbott and costello,"I received the items in a timely fashion, actually quicker than I expected. The dvd's played fine. I really enjoy ordering from Amazon. I belong to columbia house, and I couldn't tell you the last time I ordered from them since ordering from Amazon. Also the great part was I didn't have to pay for shipping. Very well pleased."
2,Abbot & Costello,"A not-so-great collection of very low-budget films. Most of the release dates are of one year, that tells you something. A couple of the movies have the anticipated gags and skits these two legends are famous for, but sadly it is very few and far between. Can't recommend it."
5,The best comedy duo of all time,This is the best of the best. Almost every classic routine can be found in this collection and The Time of Their lives is considered by many to be the finest movie that Bud and Lou made.
5,Cannot beat it for the price!,"Putting all these movies together in one collection is a stroke of genius IMHO. I'm amazed at the picture quality of these vintage movies. I owned many of them on 8mm as a kid and now get to enjoy the full length editions (some of which I have never seen all the way through). ""Hit the Ice"" has always been a favorite of mine and starts off this series well. I still haven't seen all eight, but it's like unlocking a time machine for this A&C fan. No complaints here."
2,The DVDs Are Defective - Very Disappointing!,My daughter really loves Abbott and Costello and this set would be just wonderful if we could get it to play properly. We tried it on two different dvd players and the dvds malfunctioned each time. We returned the set to the store and exchanged twice and the same problem occured each time.
3,"Great movies, rubbish set","I love Abbott and Costello, but these ""Best of's"" released by Universal are so pathetic it isn't even funny. They are flipper discs, and they are so easily damaged and cheaply made that they aren't good for anybody. I loved the movies in these sets, but come on Universal, stop using these cheap discs and use single sided discs."
5,Great Movies,Some of Abbott and Costello's best movies. The family loves them all. They arrived exactly when they were suppose to.
5,A great follow-up to volume 1!!!,"You will not be disapointed with this DVD (altough I do not know the quality of the transfer, but the collection is great).A good compliment to the first DVD and should be the cornerstone to the true A&C; fan. This set will keep you up for hours. This set contains 2 DVDs:Disc 1 - Hit the Ice, In Society, Here Comes the Coeds and The Naughty Nineties.Disc 2 - Little Giant, The Time of Their Lives (my personal favorite), Buck Privates Come Home, The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap and A&C; Meet Jerry Seinfeld.Sit back, relax and enjoy the laughter..."
5,Good Christmas Present,"I bought this to give to one of my best friends for Christmas. I haven't seen the movies, but my friend told me he was really enjoying them."
3,A for Effort,"First, whoever thought of the idea of an INFLATABLE SOFA gets major kudos from me. Absolute genius.POSITIVES:+Versatile piece that works as as a sofa or mattress+Blows up quickly (and comes with pump!)+Blow-up furniture. Come on now, that's great!NEGATIVES:+Material makes a horrible squeaking sound when you sit/lay on it+Bottom piece of couch deflates rapidly when used for sitting (<1 day of use)+Couch ""caves in"" to middle when sitting+VERY tight for 2 people to sitOverall, better as a couch than mattress, but loses air pretty quickly and is obnoxiously loud unless covered in material. It's a blow-up couch... what did you expect?"
1,worst product i ever bought on amazon,"This deserves no star as this inflatable bed doesn't last. Not more than a week before bursting and leaking. The repair accessories don't work either. Please, listen to the voice of reason and don't waste your money buying this product. If I had seen this kind of review, I would not have bought it."
4,extra sleeping space,"I previously had a raised aero bed that I lost to Hurricane Ike. It was a queen size with stablizers on the sides. This is the closest I could find. My son said that is was comfortable, but not as comfortable as the other. Recieved timely and in excellent condition,"
4,Solved my problem!,"Although its black, my sister was comfortable sleeping in my home office. Tossed a cover on when she left and I have an office again. Ta Da!!"
2,Boring.,"I found the performance plain, uninvolved and at times insecure. For good performances of Brahms' gypsy songs look for Anne Sophie von Otter, Maureen Forrester and Jessye Norman. For Brahms generally you can add Bernarda Fink, Brigitte Fassbaender, Anja Harteros and the new Hyperion series. Madeleine Jalbert on Atma can be ignored. For Dvorak's gypsy songs, go no further than Dagmar Peckova on Supraphon. Her disc is a classic. If you are a serious lieder recital collector then it's a must. Cornelia Kallisch on MDG, with superbly engineered sound, is reasonably good and has the bonus of a decent Liszt recital. Her Brahms however was disappointing for me. Bernarda Fink has another Dvorak recital due to be released. Should be good.I bought this disc for the Bendl and Novak songs, not often recorded. If you haven't heard them then you are not missing much."
5,Wonderful Manzotti,"In this CD Angelo Manzotti shows his really uncommon vocal skills. It's an impressive and unusal singing: you love him or you hate him...... In any case I believe it's the closest we can get nowadays to the lost kind of castrato voice.The only thing I didn't really like is the accompanying orchestra..... if this recording would have been done with ensembles such as Europa Galante, Giardino Armonico or Akademie fur alte Musik Berlin, it would have been one of the most impressive CDs ever produced! Anyway, this early CD along with his latest ones such Handel's ""Evil Arias"" and Campra Motets is a must for anyone interested in XVIII century vocal music."
5,Good teaching tool,"My daughter used this book to review for a math test for entering nursing school. It provides many many problems, examples, and answers. At the end of the each chapter there is a quiz. I would recommend this book if you need to review/learn these type of problems. After failing the school entrance test the first time, she did significantly better after extensive practice using this book and passed the second time. I am also a secondary special education teacher and use this book to provide reenforcement of concepts taught in the classroom or for review."
3,Math essentials,"As an adult returning to college, I needed to brush up on some unused Math skills. I found the instructions easy to follow in this textbook and relearned some basic, valuable computations. Worth the money."
4,Great book--makes it simple,"Very logical, easy to understand. Plenty of practice. The only problem is that if you need algebra or geometry, you'll have to buy number power 3 and 4. Also, it could do with more word problems."
3,John Cuddy,"Early on in the series: writin is good not great, plots are thin, talking to the ex wife seems contrived"
1,"Quick shipping, runny glue.","The shipment came in a timely fashion, but the glue was runny and clear for the first 1/8th of the bottle. Really need to send out newer product. This package obviously was older. Be careful when ordering this product."
4,Excellent Read,This is a great inspiring book to read if you love Lacrosse and the background to the sport. It has had a huge impact on my lacrosse life and i take it alot more serious now. This book is a must read!!!
4,Could be more elegant,"I must say that I am a bit frustrated by my encounter with something as brilliant and relevant as this book. The reason is that the subject matter could be made useful to a much wider audience if only the writing weren't so dense. I wish more intellectuals placed a stronger value on elegant lucidity. The very fact that we are becoming a more integrated society in every way, including across disciplines, makes this book relevant to not just the academic community, but society at large. Making these concepts so complicated limits their applicability to a comparatively small number of people.While I realize the intended audience is, obviously, not society at large, I am giving it four stars for the very fact that it could have been written better. I know because Nicolescu's book ""Science, Meaning, and Evolution"" is much more accessible."
3,Good but short,"This vid is a nice little piece cut from one of those nostalgia PBS shows I guess. The performance is good, the sound is good, but the length is short-certainly for the price. But...if you like Peter, it's still worth it!"
2,Good but not great!,"There are Many, many More Songs Peter Noone Sings but only 10 on this song list, not enough, Herman Hermits Fans want to hear more!"
4,Everything comes together,"In Darker Than Black volume 6, all the story threads and hints from the entire series get neatly wrapped up with one or two exceptions. The animation in this series is gorgeous, and the music by Yoko Kanno really sets the mood. The ending is a little rushed, but this still is one of the year's better anime series."
4,"Final ""Darker Than Black"" Installment - Recommended","This is the 6th DVD in the ""Darker Than Black"" series. Since this DVD contains episodes 23 - 26, I recommend starting onDarker Than Black: Volume Oneas there is a lot of backstory not explained in these episodes.Unlike the previous volumes, the four episodes on this DVD are more standalone, with the first three concluding the main plot line that was building up since the first episode. Most of the outstanding questions about Hei (AKA: BK201, The Black Reaper) and his sister are finally answered. We also learn more about ""The Syndicate"" (the group Hei worked for) and the shadowy Pandora organization.This is an exciting and action packed volume that provides a satisfactory conclusion to the Darker Than black series (there may be a new `season' in production).Recommended!"
2,Not much to shout about,Google Yeast and learn more on web sites about this topic. This book may be outdated. Didnt really finish reading it.
4,Good,"I enjoyed this movie and enjoyed the soundtrack. I did not really like the covers as much as I thought, but overall the disc is nice, if you enjoy the movie!"
5,What fun!,I am really pleased overall by this bonus tracks. The marylin manson version of 'This is Halloween' just kicks [...] all over the place. Fiona Apple's 'Sally's Lament' is haunting. The only weak track is 'Kidnap Sandy Claws' by She wants Revenge. What were they thinking? I think fans of the movie will enjoy this.
4,A few mixed feelings...,This is a great soundtrack that would get a 5 start review from me. Unfortunately the additional material is uneven and knocks my enthusiasm for the entire package down a notch. Fiona Apple's cover of Sally's Song is my fav with the low point being She Wants Revenge's version of Kidnap the Sandy Claws.Need a new copy of The Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack? Skip this one and find a copy of the original.
5,Best cover work you will ever hear!,"This disc includes the origianl soundtrack which is fabulous but the bonus dsic is where the real gold is! The 5 covers songs are so worth it! My faveorite is Fall Out Boys version of ""What's This?"" Which then leads into a sweet ""Kidnap The Sandy Claws"" by She Wants Revenge which honestly I didn think I would like but I LOVE! Make this your first purchase on AMAZON.COM"
2,ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.,"The stars that I have granted this CD are for the FIRST DISC ONLY. The original soundtrack to this gem of a film is one of the most majestic and beautifully macabre group of songs ever put into cinema (in this humble reviewer's opinion). This just fuels the fact that three of the five covers on the second disc are affronts to Elfman fans everywhere. Hearing some of my childhood favorites butchered by bands like Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco makes me literally sick to my stomach. I love The Nightmare Before Christmas because it is DIFFERENT. It's strange, dark, and wholly original. It shouldn't be sampled by two of the most popular bands in America, who, despite what their fans might classify them as, are POP BANDS. These recordings are shameful, and should never be listened to by ANYBODY. Buy this for the spectacular first disc, and the privilege of SMASHING the second disc."
1,Missing parts,It was missing the metal ball and the screws to be able to put it together. it was very disappointing.
5,Sound Selling - an active learning approach that works,"""The Sound Selling Audiobook is right there with the leading 'active learning' trend in training - great training exactly when and where you need it"".-- Tim McMahonAuthor of ""Selling 2000"" and ""Dear God, I Never Wanted to Be a Salesman!"""
3,Not as good as it used to be,"I have been using Sally Hansen bleach for several years now. I used to like it but for some reason it no longer works as it used to.I don't know if they have changed the concentration of the ingredients or what. Even if I don't store the box in the bathroom, the powder becomes pasty and clumps. Then it gets difficult to pour the adequate amount to mix with the cream. Toward the end of the product it becomes unusable and I have to throw it away."
1,It works but beware,"I used sally hansen bleach to lighten my upper lip hair for more than 2 years. It always worked well until one day when I washed it off I was left with a dark pigmentation around my mouth. I thought it will go away after a good nights sleep but it didn't. It took several months to fade even slightly. So beware, looks like it isn't as harmless as it seems after all."
2,only good for cheap and very temporary quick fix,This product does work fast like it said and it does bleach the hair but do not use this product if you want long term results and in long term i mean more than 3 days. after about 3-5 days somehow the bleach wears away and the hair goes back to brown i even tried it a few times and everytime after a few days hair goes back to same color it was in the first place. only good for a cheap quick fix.
2,Red bumps,I followed instructions and tested it on my arm. No allergic reactions there. But after putting it on my forehead for about a minute I can feel my skin getting irritated and after seeing red bumps I had to wash it off. Just FYI I have no zits on my forehead.
4,good value for money,pro: like it. good value for money. really makes a visible difference.con: i have to bleach every two-three weeks
3,Product was open,"I was disappointed that product was shipped to me open when I received, besides that I am happy with the brand."
1,8 wks and still no product,"I ordered the product 8 weeks ago. It still hasn't arrived. After so many emails with the company, they would not send out a new one to replace it or give me a refund. They told me I have to download a refund form and POST IT IN TO THEM! I asked could I scan or fax and they said NO! Every update I got was only a generic email and they said for me to do all the follow up with USPS. I will not use this company again. The product I have used many times and it is great!"
5,Brother to Brother,Wonderful story...about a young African American male struggling to find himself in the world...as a gay person. The acting is good...I would recommend this movie highly!
5,excellent historical gay drama,"excellent drama dealing with the black harlem renaissance, with a gay perspective. the actors and directing is convincing.taking place during the harlem renaissance and the present the young black man in this film learns that the past and present are very much the same."
3,Brother to Brother on amazon,Brother to Brother is a look into black gay life when it was totally taboo when it was done behind closed doors and was not talked about in dark rooms and people who did not want to be found our what is moral and not tolerated in the times society is is comical when you think about it not the best film but enjoyable has some great moments
3,It is ok.,This movie is basically geared toward gay afro-american males. It shows the contributions of famous gay black men during the Harlem Renaissance. It throws in a piece about James Baldwin who had nothing to do with this time period other did he was gay too. It is not totally factual. Wallace Thruman did not die the way showed in the movie.It was just ok.
1,african-american experience,"not a good script kind of slow, a regular movie if You are into history In America, but If You dont live there, or got any interest in this particular plot, I wont recomended, is boring"
4,Touching story about growing up gay in the black community.,This touching drama lets you see how growing up gay has changed over two generations in the African American community in the United States. I believe that this movie was one of the most under exposed looked movies of the year.
3,somewhat skepital,"The problem I have with the ultra lite is they do not fit the face well. When you look down you see underneath the lens. When you walk and look down there is no lens protection. What you see is with the naked eye. They might fit a child well, but not for ex-football players."
3,Finally a fat reucing gel for men,Nice to finally find a product that is usually geared towards women. It smells masculine and does the job. I have trimmed down my waist by an inch so far and my stomach is starting to look more toned.
4,I like this product,I had heard about topical fat removing cream for women my sister uses something like that on herself. I have tried hers. I like Dermazide because it's packaged and geared towards men that need it for the same purpose as woman. I don't have cellulite just a thick layer of fat on my stomach that I've been working really hard to get rid of. I think Dermazide has made a difference.
3,"Fair results so far, on week 3 using this gel",I guess you can say this product works. You need to burn calories as well but I can tell that it is working.
4,THis has helped my college beer belly flatten out....,"Unbelievable, sit up's and crunches just weren't cutting it, this gel really helped me get my stomach flatter."
1,You need to list the polysaccharide content,"It is the derivative nonlinear polysaccharides (beta glucans) that have been the subject of nearly thirty years of Japanese clinical research.Without knowing the percentage of polysaccharides, it isn't possible to make a decision to buy this product unless it is simply being taken as a mushroom extract food flavoring."
5,I love this fragrance,"This is a wonderful fragrance, a hint of the tropics in a cold climate is just what the doctor ordered! The price is incredible too, like half what I would pay in a department store."
4,If you decide you don't need the more complete sets . . .,"If you don't need the more complete collections by either artist, of which there are several selections ranging from single disk to boxed sets, then this is more than decent. Honestly, I only selected it because I found it significantly marked down in a used bin. Otherwise, I would have preferred a more complete collection by both Patton and Jefferson.That said, the sound quality is about as good as possible with these old recordings and you get a pretty decent taste for each artist. The liner notes are very excellent and the CD makes for a good listen. Now that I have it, I'm not positive I really NEED more than this. That's not to criticize the artists; but merely to point out this taste of them goes a long way."
2,"Right battery, short life","This battery does fit and work in the camera, but it's life is very short. I found that I had to carry two or three extra batteries to get through one day in port during a recent cruise. The batteries are cheap in price, and honestly, you get what you pay for."
1,Where Is My Purchase,I have had several back-order messages for a product that was supposed to be a Christmas Gift. No one seems to know much about it.
4,Patience but end result was well worth it,"The printer came in and the first one that was sent had a motor issue, however the company Orion was really nice, had great tech support. Sent another printer out the next week. Don't expect your printer problems to be fixed immediatetly always have a backup."
4,An entertaining and enlightening look at a complex subject!,"This book gives a full account of one woman's experiences- the good and the bad. While it neither defends nor damns the sex industry or its workers, it gives the reader a concise, easy to read, entertaining insight."
2,"great idea, but finicky and poorly made","My 10yo daughter and I have had a set for a while, and we get it out from time to time, but its limitations hold us back. For one thing, the tabs on the ends of the tracks get broken off easily, so they won't stick together. The other thing is simply the limitation of the toy for building things quick. It's not a tinkertoy, it's more of a toy that requires thoughtful and careful construction to get it to do interesting things. It's fine for that, and as an adult I have the patience for it, but not so for my kid. Hope that helps!"
5,"Good Purchase, Great Toy","This toy was a success with our 6 year old who is now 8 and still plays with it. Kids can follow the instructions and make the tracks or easily create their own. Some he has done climb down the stairs and over chairs etc. Good toy, not total junk."
2,Rail keeps coming apart,"Looked like it would be fun, but is really flimsy. The rail falls apart when the marble runs over it in multiple sections."
4,Great building & learning toy,"This is a fantastic toy for kids who like to build. There is a book with designs that you can use as a guide, or as you become more proficient you can design your own. My kids have created many designs from their own imagination with lots of loops, curves, and roller coaster action. It does take some patience for re-adjusting and getting things just right, but that is part of the learning process (think early physics concepts). The negatives are: 1) we did not get any glow-in-the-dark tracks with this set, 2) the rail connections are flimsy and break too easily, 3) the bases for the columns are not weighted so you have to use books or something to stabilize. Overall, absolutely worth $30. If only Quercetti would send replacement rails...."
3,A bit disappointing,"I bought this expecting after the reviews to have to buy a 2nd set. Yes the track is flimsy, but I know it has to be that way to be flexible to do the loops. But we left it in a multiple loop pattern (the one in the book) the first night we had it and that was a mistake. Now we can't get the straight pieces to be straight again! We also seem to have trouble with the curves. No matter which weight marble we use they don't seem to stay on when we put together option 6 in the book. I would think that since it's in the book the engineers have tested it and it should work. My son is getting discouraged. He's almost 7 and usually very in to these types of things, but this is disappointing for us. I'm thinking of trying to return it since we've only had it a few days and he's not liking it much any more."
4,Great toy that is fun to playwith.,Me and my nephews can play with this for hours and there are so many different ways to put it together. The item is a good quality and is easy to put together and take apart.
3,"Fun toy, but a little cheaply made.","My 7 year old got this for his birthday and while we had a lot of fun with it, it was kind of a pain to put together. The black connector pieces are very hard to remove when placed incorrectly, the towers are not weighted very well and are knocked over very easily, and the instructions were awful! It showed how to make tracks for sets we didn't have and just showed a picture of the finished track for the set we did have. We figured it out and once done it is fun to play with, just a few tweaks would make it a lot more user friendly for kids."
1,unhappy,"I thought this would be a great project for my classroom enrichment. The early-finishers were so excited to construct this. It was a good connection to what they were learning in science. Unfortunately there were many missing pieces, and there were extras of others. There was no way to even start. Needless to say the 3 students were VERY disappointed today."
1,Re-think purchase,"I purchased this product based on the reviews I read and I wanted to give my input for the future buyer. I wish I had know this ahead of time.This was a Christmas present for my son and it did NOT entertain him for hours like some of the other reviews state. It's HUGE! So much for the extra space in his room.The marbles keep flying off the track (no matter how many times we ""adjust""). This just frustrates him and he goes on to play with something else. The cables are complicated for a child to understand and I am sure my husband would like me to let you know it takes a VERY long time to set up!My son would have had more fun with a BAG of marbles and he would have had more room in his room.Please consider this before you buy. Seriously, pass on this useless toy."
2,"Nice try, but not as good as it appears","I am a mechanical engineer and very well versed in physics. This toy was created based on a fun idea of creating a coaster in which different size/weight marbles can ride on. However, if the velocity of the marble is too high going around one of the turns, it will fall off. If you slow the marble down enough for it to handle the turns, then it is no longer fun. My 6 and 9 year old were both dissapointed. The fun of a toy like this is to be able see the marbles move quickly. I wish the track was designed such that the marble can sit deeper inside and possible handle turns at higher velocities."
2,"Poorly designed, needs a lot of fussing","We purchased this big kid marble run last Christmas. Our children never touched it after the first day. It does not work as designed. My husband had to add bean bags to all of the bases to keep them from falling over. The marbles included with the set could not complete the loop. We did have success with lighter weight marbles that we had around the house. Curves had to be adjusted multiple times to keep the marbles on the track. I guess there was some educational value for the kids to try to figure out how to make this poorly designed product work. They needed significant coaching from their engineer father. By the time they got it to work, they had lost interest. It was a waste of money."
3,"plenty of fun, light on the durability","there's no getting around the fact that this is a pretty fun toy. however, it's not what i'd call durable. the connectors tend to loosen over time and the track correspondingly starts to sag. good fun, just be careful with it. additionally, it's probably best to use this on a hard surface."
4,"Good, but....","We have had this toy for at least 3 years, and the only real problem, besides it just being plastic, is that we had to make rock weights for the bottom of the supports to keep the posts steady while in motion. But it does incourage creativity. This year we bought the Magnetix iCoaster. Now that is an outstanding coaster and durable."
3,"Fun, Fascinating, and Outdated","Not an ideal book for this generation. In such a fast-moving industry, a book like this is useless within six to eight years. Just look at the year the book was made.From a scholarly perspective, however, it's interesting to read about the changes in attitudes about gaming from one generation to the next."
3,used for research,"I bought this book as research for a class, but it was not as informative as the description led me to believe."
5,Excellent genealogy history,...What a tremendous work of research and you brought it right down to the present...It's a beautiful book. I'm keeping it for my son's Christmas. Something one can give the man who has everything...
3,No Pares - El Simbolo,"Songs have mostly the same rythm. Needs more variety. The song 1,2,3 is pretty good! That's the kind of music El Simbolo should stick to."
5,"1,2,3 is still going strong in Mexico","I just came back from vacation in Cancun and they play 1,2,3 all the time, it's a very popular song down there! It, along with El Simbolo's other songs, is very fun to listen and dance to.. it evokes pleasant memories of the fun I've had in Mexico."
5,The album is excellent!,"I have heard all the songs on this album, and if you like latin music, this C.D. is the best. It has great songs to dance to, and just to listen to. Every song has a great beat!"
5,Great songs to Dance to,I really enjoyed this CD it is full of life and great to dance to. If you enjoy latin music and enjoy dancing then this CD is perfect for you
5,Desde Mexico!,"El disco es exelente, y los 15 temas son muy buenos! El 1,2,3 y Levantando las manos estan bien chidos!"
4,Another solid Blue Note Release,"Trompeta Toccata is another good collaboration from the early 1960s between trumpeter Kenny Dorham and saxophonist Joe Henderson. If you like Dorham's ""Una Mas"" and Henderson's ""Page One"", ""Our Thing"", and ""In n Out"", you will like this session."
3,Rip Rig & Panic,"I actually haven't heard this, but I'm quite familiar with the Slits and the Pop Group. With regards to Neneh Cherry, she was also in Rip Rig & Panic (a group started by Pop Group members after the band broke up). Eventually, she left and had that one mainstream hit. Other Pop Group members founded Pig Bag and Mark Stewart went solo. At one point, the Pop Group drummer was also playing drums for the Slits."
3,Mouse Trap Gets Stuck...,While playing Mouse Trap the computer player landed on a space where they were to take two pieces of cheese from the player with the most cheese. I received a message on the bottom saying that the computer player was selecting and then it stuck like that. I ended up having to go back to the main menu and quit the game.
3,Nintendo ds games,"i dont really like this game so much. i bought it for my angel, and she is not too fond of it. so if she is not too fond of it and its her game, then something must be wrong. i played it and found it could be better"
2,Not what I expected!!,"The games are fun but I was disappointed because while you can play with up to 4 players, each player must have the same game card. If I had known this I would have purchased another game. I thought both of my children would be able to enjoy this at the SAME time. I don't think the games are as fun without family or friends to play against. So I am not happy with this at all."
4,It's the pits to get old,The game arrived in a very timely order. And my friend is enjoying to try to remember how to play the games. We are both senior citizens and had played all these games as either kids or with our kids. Thanks for a professional experience.
3,Clue,"Product is great, however took seller a while to ship product. Not sure what the hold up was but it was almost a week after I ordered before product was shipped"
2,It had promise...,"I was excited at the prospect of having four great classic games all in one -- what could be better? Sadly, when I started to play these games, I became quickly disappointed. I would say the best of the four is Perfection, as it actually requires a modicum of skill and can be played in under 20 minutes. Aggravation lives up to its name, mainly because even the quick play round seems to take hours and all you do is watch pieces move around the board. Mouse Trap, however, is the worst offender, as the joy that comes from the actual game board doesn't translate at all to an electronic platform. You merely watch your game piece move around the screen and if you get lucky, you get to tap your stylus once in awhile. While I've had exceptionally good luck with DS games in the past and tend to be fairly selective with my purchases, I can't help but slide this into the 'best laid plans' category."
1,This sucks!!,"This game is not what I thought. I wanted to buy a game to play with people or by myself, but this is a multi-player that requires multiple cards. The way it sounded, I could play with people, well I can if everybody else has this same game. Where's the fun in that? I sent tihs back because of that."
2,"Not fun, not touch intuitive","I had this game and played it for about an hour before I went to the game store and traded it in towards something else. Clue was probably the best game in the pack. I thought the touch controls were tedious. For example, Perfection seemed like it would be the perfect game for the touch screen - but all you do is touch the piece and then touch where you want it to go on the board, and the game puts the piece in place at its own pace. Mouse Trap and Aggravation were both mediocre - graphics are not good. This game probably holds the most entertainment value for those under 12."
3,"Okay, if you don't feel like making notecards","This book is essentially no more than a flipbook of notecards. On one side of a page is the word, on the opposite side is the definition and a sample sentence. On the corner of each page is a gray triangle that you're supposed to fold to mark that you have learned the word. This is a good idea, especially if you're too lazy to make your own notecards. However, I question some of the words they put on the book that seem like they never will be on the SAT. Also, the words in the book are bascially the same as the word lists found in the back of their SAT verbal book."
1,Not happy...,I bought this toy for my nephew and it got put away right after he opened it. The drum sticks are so long! he kept putting them into his mouth and really gagging himself with them. Not for a small child.
2,Isaak's mom,My son doesnt play with this drum until another child shows interest. The drum sticks are attached with very short cords and it's hard for him to get the sticks on the drum. they need to be a little bit longer.
5,A quiet drum!,"This is the best drum ever! Why - because it's fairly quiet and won't burst your eardrums. A major plus for any household. This drum is durable - ours has been stood on, sat on, thrown, pulled along behind my toddler etc etc and it's barely been scratched! The drumsticks are attached by strings (and not too long that your toddler is going to choke themselves) and can be snaped into a little holder on the side of the drum for storage. The only problem I have is it is that my daughter insists on chewing on the drumsticks (when not banging) and shoving them halfway down her throat so supervision is necessary for younger children if they like to chew on things."
3,a good drum,"very durable, ok sound. If I had to do it again, I would wait until the kid is older and get them something that sounds better. For a 2 or 3 year old, it's a good toy to own!"
2,Boring,"I bought this in a set that came with 2 maracas and 1 toy piano. My daughter loved the maracas and kinda liked the piano but had NO interest in the drum. The cords are too short to really ""bang"" on the drum anyway and then it doesn't make much of a sound when you do manage to ""bang"" it. She's had it since Christmas and still has no interest in it..."
5,Perfect wedding keepsake,"This was the first purchase my fiance and I made together in preparation for our wedding later this year. The minute we saw the book, we knew we had to get it for our wedding. We liked the colorful illustrations that accompanied each page and particularly enjoyed reading the quotations Ms. Branch shares. This book is a must-have and the price is a steal! We're planning on passing the book around at our rehearsal dinner for friends and family members to sign in before displaying it at our wedding. For anyone who likes personalized wedding keepsakes, this book is definitely for you."
5,A great preview of Cash's early days at Sun Records.,"The Sun Records sessions were probably the greatest chance to experience the birth of country/rhythm and blues, and that is why I chose this album. Elvis and Johnny were probably THE most successful graduates of Sam Phillips' vast list of singers. I like both singers and this is THE place to start with the birth of a legend. Elvis has a similar CD collection from Sun Records. Listening to these collections is like opening up a very old, fine wine. Although there are only a small handful of recognizable selections, each song is a treasure for me."
2,Boring,"As a fan of the manga and anime, I was very disappointed in this movie I couldn't finish it. Storyline was not develop and boring. Subtitle did not match what they were saying. Did not make much sense."
3,Enjoyable Enough Movie But Also Pretty Bland Too,"The few things about the movie that make it very enjoyable to watch was the scenery, acting, and the overall storyline for the movie but it also feels a little dragging as well as you seem to wait for something to happen. The one negative I have about the movie and probably the biggest is that it just felt like we were watching a live action on the anime series to much, I would have preferred that the writers and director had given us a little different story arc for the movie instead of it feeling like we were watching a two hour shortened version of the series itself. The actors and actresses did very well in the movie and it was nice also getting to hear the dubbed voice cast from the anime series but in all if you have the anime series that's all you pretty much need though for what the price this dvd is going for it's probably still a nice add on for your collection...."
4,it could've been great,"This movie could've been great. The story line is actually interesting, but the Mushi were not displayed as well as they could've been. The dubbing is just fine in English, well done in fact I would say. It just drags a little. It isn't the actors, it's just missing some finesse that would've made it a great movie and I would say that's on the producers & the director. I will say it isn't at all what you would expect and it does have some terrific moments.I just wish they had stepped it up a notch so it would've been fantastic to watch.Why not make it fantastic when it was in reach, imo. Don't expect a ton of action. Instead, expect a mystery and you should enjoy it."
4,The talking coffins of Cryo-City,"I haven't read this book since middle school, but still think back on it to this day, at 36 years old. A very good read for the tween age."
5,First book I ever read in one night,"Even though it has been about 8 years since I first and last read this book (I was in 7th grade and I am now 21) I still find this book to be a very good pre-teen book.I find the way that it desrcibes the events that lead up to the climax very intresting and how the author describes in detailed what happens a very good book to pre-teens.I am a very hard person to keep my attention on anything. So to hold my attention so I would finish it in 1 night, it has to be a good book.I recoment this book to those pre-teens who are into science fiction."
3,An unusual mixture of topics,"This is a strange and unique book--very seldom does one encounter a book that discusses quantum theory and tarot cards with (apparently) equal seriousness! I mainly bought it for the material on quantum theory , and here the author does a fine job by presenting many analogies, most that I hadn't seen before, which were quite helpful. But perhaps due to what the author would classify as my Western, linear thinking, the plethora of material on non-Western and/or non-scientific approaches to ""Theories of the Universe"", left me generally cold. Though interesting at times, there was ultimately too much of this material for my taste. Readers with a different world view from mine will no doubt react differently. I will be keeping the book for its excellent material on quantum theory."
2,"Look pretty good, but uncomfortable","I liked the look of these shoes, but they're very hard and quite uncomfortable. Smell like any other pair from Payless Shoes (this peculiar smell of Chinese shoes), but that's my personal preference - I like Italian leather shoes that just don't smell like crap. I seriously doubt this pair will last longer than a season given hard leather and glued hard plastic sole."
1,Kindle Edition Sucks,"My critique refers only to the Kindle edition:This was poorly converted to electronic form, full of errors which would normally be spelling problems or typos, but are actually due to bad conversion. Quite often makes it difficult to figure out the meaning of a sentence. It is not worth the price. Better to buy the actual book or get it from your library (probably through interlibrary loan)."
5,AMAZING STORY,"The first time I was interesting in, was when I read an article about Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb in a magazine. The story captive me. I found this book with a lot of details. I learned a lot of new things about this case. The author is a good one. I strongly recommend to buy this book if you're interesting in this story. It's AMAZING."
5,thephotojournalist,"After reading some of the reviews from this book, I almost passed on reading it myself. What a mistake that would have been! This book does tend to read like a term paper - but when there is this much drama in a real life story - I don't need the author to spruce it up! From a legal perspective - we have come a long way in protecting the rights of criminals (i.e. 5th & 6th amendment). A great legal history read. And a nail-bitting story! Couldn't put it down."
4,Highly strange incident,"This book is in many ways confusing and bewildering. The writing is not as clear as could be, and coupled with the extreme strangeness of the subject matter, it is hard to follow. I recommend this book highly to knowledgeable students of the UFO enigma, but it should not be your first book on UFOs.I have rated this book very highly, because as documentation of a UFO incident, it is a primary resource. John Vasquez is a simple, honest person who got caught up in a series very strange events. He has presented documentation of his military records, and other correspondence concerning his attempt to find out what really happened to him and other members of his battalion."
4,cute story about adoption,"Flying across the world to become part of a new family can be scary but wonderful at the same time, as told by a little boy in this story. I liked that it does star a boy rather than a boy, like many adoption stories do. The story is written in simple understandable language and the illustrations are soft but filled with detail to interest young readers. The little expresses some of his feelings about adoption and I am sure many young adopted readers will find themselves relating with his thoughts. This is a good one."
3,OK shoes,"These clogs are okay, but just okay. Not great for walking as the staples inside rub on the foot and are uncomfortable. Not the quality I expected from a Birkenstock product. I would not buy Betula shoes again."
3,Patience !!!,"The product Nubuck clog is satisfactory for the money. The problem was with receiving the correct size, 2 times the ""wrong shoe size"" was in the ""correct shoe size box"". The first time was disappointing, and I understand ""mistakes happen"", imagine my surprise when the 2nd time the same mistake happened. I do have to commend ""Midwest Sports"" for paying for shipping each time & for responding in a timely manner. Mostly it was just an inconvenience for me on 2 occasions."
2,"confusing, but an interesting concept","when I first saw this book I found it sounded like it would be interesting, but once I started I found it hard to understand confusing, jumping to one plot after another, I just cannot recommend this book."
4,really good book,"This book is really well made,cute and well organised, alas, it is in english ! How many books like this should be translated in french..."
1,Sound Problems. Do Not Buy MP3!,"These are wonderful works beautifully played. However, there is horrible crackling throughout the sinfonias. Consider trying the CD, but be aware that the iTunes tracks have the same problem, so perhaps the source is defective. Seek these works on other albums."
2,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"i bought this and within two weeks i had dropped calls and tons of static, i was coming from a nokia 3595 and that phone was better then this one. i went back to tmobile and they just gave me the same one all over again, geuss what, same thing all over again, ive had it with this phone!"
1,IT CALLS THE POLICE ONCE A DAY BY ITS SELF,This phone calls the police all the time....one entry says once a month; more like 3 times a week. The local police department has threatend to press charges. I am currently working with samsung to get a phone upgrade....I went strait to Samsung and they told me to get bent and that it was a requested feature by T-mobile who told me to contact Samsung......
1,Piece of Junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This phone is a piece of junk!!!!!!!! The battery life is short, the reception is terrible, and the phone freezes. On top of that, T-Mobile has the worst customer service. Never buy this phone or any phone with T-Mobile! They rip you off!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Two stars for effort.,The setting and the premise are interesting but the story never develops. People and events are never connected. This book reads more like a rough draft than a finished story.
2,Beware the Reviews,"There was a lot of hype in the NYTimes about this book along with a great review. Now that I've read it, it seems to me it's the good-old-boys network supporting one of their own. It realy is nothing more than a potboiler. So much of the story is disjointed - you are jarred going from one scene to another - where is the transition or even the rationale? No character is real - they merely behave how you would think they should. There is no real development and no poetry in the writing. It really seems like a non-fiction writer said ""now I must write that novel."" Too bad really good books by completely unknown writers don't get the big write-up from the Times. My book club prefers to read books they have ""heard about"" rather than try a new author who really has talent. So much for promoting new good writers rather than ensuring that the inner circle keeps earning their money so they can stick around and support their buddies. Corrupt that this book gets the big splash."
2,Stick to nonfiction!,"Our book club recently read ""The Worst Hard Times"" by Timothy Egan and we loved it! However, the authors first foray into nonfiction falls terribly flat. Since it was another selection for our book club, I trudged through it, gagging on the stilted dialogue, underdeveloped characters, and lack of emotional depth. On the bright side, the authors sense of place aptly depicts the Northwest, but then almost too much so. He gets lost in overdone descriptions...of everything except for his characters. I give him credit for trying to write fiction, but for the time being I will stick to his nonfiction books, which really shine."
4,Catchy plot,"Good read, draws you into very interesting topics. Timothy Egan is good on details but you never feel overwhelmed. His romance story line needs work, he hasn't had to use that with his other works."
3,The Winemaker's Daughter,The book was not in as good of shape as advertised. It was delivered quickly.
5,the best hand cream,I have used this product for years. It is odorless and not greasy. It has a waxy consistency and dries rapidly. I have never found a product that comes closer to being the perfect hand cream.
5,I love that stuff.,"I use Lotil all the time, especially during the winter. It is not greasy and it keeps the skin moist."
3,just ok,I prefer cetaphil cream both for how well it works and the smell. I wake up with much improved skin with cetaphil over the lotil.
3,Hand Cream for Dry Skin,"The packaging is great to carry with you or in the car. However, I don't find this cream to be any better than those I have tried in the past at a fraction of the cost of the Lotil Cream. I'm going to stick with the Neutrogena Norwegian Formula along with AHAVA CREAM... worth the money. Also, Triple Lanolin ALoe Vera that the professional manicurists use is also preferred."
5,My husband calls it a miracle cream,My husband has always had problems with his finger tips in the winter. They have reached a point where the skin is just splitting. He has tried about everything on the market. He ran across this cream in a catalog and had me order it. He noticed a difference after two days. Now after using is for two weeks his hands are no problem at all. It leaves no greasy feeling when he uses it. He had me order two jars so he will be sure to keep it handy.
4,Utterly charming,"There's nothing to dislike about this CD. It won't change your life, but it will entertain and amuse you for an hour. J-Pop is the music of magpie minds (with a hefty nod towards the concept of 'swinging'), so it's sole function is entertainment rather than enlightenment. One quibble: the Cornelius track is a remix by Sean O' Hagan and says more about High Llamas than Cornelius. Two other points: 1) Cornelius must be seen live to be fully believed. 2) The Fantastic Plastic Machine track is so good I use it as the theme on the soccer radio show I do in the UK. Yes, that good."
2,JUST OK,"Doesn't shave well, not easy to plug into adapter and then put on shaver - sometimes doesn't connect correctly and doesn't charge. Very dissappointed in product."
1,Disappointed,"The Braun LS-5550 Silk&Soft BodyShave Rechargeable Cord/Cordless Women's Shaver is absolutely useless, not fit for purpose."
3,I Miss My Lady Remington--,"After 10 years my old razor quit working.This is now the 2nd new electric razor I purchased. Why can't these companies make a good shaver anymore? Get rid of the gimmicks and just make a good electric shaver!The Braun is much better than the remington I just ret'd but.....Pros: Great battery chargeAn ok shave but not as close as I wantGreat for underarmsCons: You must use their attachment or you will get razor burn, found outthe burned way. Read their instruction booklet.Does not give a once over shave, takes a few times and I now need topay more attention or hairs are missed. So aggravating!"
1,Does not cut,I'm glad to see someone else had problems. I recv'd this as a gift and am very disappointed. Multiple passes over thick coarse hair and stubble everywhere. I thought maybe it needed a better charge so I recharged it. That didn't help. So then I went and bought some nice shaving gel (don't ask me why I thought that would make a difference but I really wanted this to work). Still no good. Don't waste your money.
1,not very good,This item didn't work very well. It wasn't a close shave at all. I used it twice before my dog chewed it up. It left a fine stubble on my legs and kind of hurt my armpits both times i used it.
5,Centurion Silver computer case (tool-less),"This is a great case to use for a build.There is plenty of room inside and more than enough slots for future up-grades. There were no sharp edges to get cut on and this case is very sturdy and well built. The cooling fans run super quiet as promised and the included 390 watt psu unit was super quiet as well. This was my first computer build and I have to say that this case made it easy enough. Mine didn't come with the side window like Amazon advertized it would but it was no big deal because they gave me a nice discount on it. I like the tool-less design too because there were no screws to use on the drives. Just slide them in, lock them in place, and you are done. Would recommend it to anyone to use."
4,"An excellent debut, I must say!","This CD is great for people at all ranges. The CD has lyrics based on the on-going tales of love, and how it affects the average human. In many ways, Ashanti points out little details that I have not noticed about 'love' in the past. She has proven that she is a very talented Composer and Artist for that matter.The long-awaited debut of Ashanti Douglas is worth the money! The genre she uses is a new creation, or at least not heard to the average ear. It has a big range of different genres that are combined into one. Some have fast tempo like ""Happy,"" and ""Baby"" obviously telling a positive story of love. Where as ""Over"" and ""Scared"" show some of the negative points of love.This is definetly a must for most R&B and Hip-Hop Lovers!"
5,FABLOUS*****,"May 18,2003I have Got this album already but to all people SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!! its so great with R&B; soul and some hip hop its a GREAT MIXTURE the most thing i like with this album it has all kinds of Catorgeory of music in here!so you should buy this album Ashanti does a great job on doing her First Debut with her album so i give it ***** five stars!"
1,shes a hater,"Don't buy anything from ashanti on mtv she was hating on aaliyah shesaid ""I miss aaliyah and everthing but i'm better than her she ain't got nothing on me"". So usally when people say stuff like they don't sell nothing. I was a ashanti fan but i'm a bigger aaliyah fan..."
3,Next Time I will Listen to a CD before Purchasing,"When I purchase the cd I thought Ashanti would have a different sound from other artists, but it all sounds repetitious. However I did like a few of her tracks."
3,MAIN DESCRIPTION MISLEADING,"The description for this was a bit misleading. The descriptions of the product said ""DVD"" everywhere except in ""Editorial Reviews"", where it says ""DVD-ROM"". I thought it was a regular DVD you could watch on a DVD player, but you have to watch it on the computer. It should have said ""DVD ROM"" right from the start of the ad. Besides that, it is good."
2,Save your money,"This things eats through batteries & the distance is not all that great. I set in the middle of my seats & if the battery is not brand new, it does not tune in very well unless I have it in the windshield."
4,Entertaining classical pieces for music lovers,"Classical music can be most entertaining outside big concert halls. I've once enjoyed a very intimate live performance of this Terzetto concertante for a small audience, and finally found it on cd. Those who are already familiar with Paganini's works for guitar and violin will certainly love this music, those who only know Paganini's concertos or capriccios should learn this musical side of his. Here is much more than the acrobatic Paganini, here will be found the creative process of his composing, pleasant elegancy and melodic singing quality."
1,Product materially different than described on website,"Rubbermaid recently updated its FastTrack products with a new design.The old 47.5"" upright ""with gripper"" as pictured and described on Amazon came with two separate pieces: a gripper, and an upright that connects to it.The newer product (not pictured or described) that Amazon actually ships is a 47.5"" upright without a gripper that is moulded to snap onto the FastTrack rail.If you are ordering this product to match with older shelving uprights or because you would like to attach the gripper to a shorter upright you should NOT purchase this product as it is not what you will receive."
3,Image is different than the product received,"Rubbermaid has changed the Uprights, they no longer have the bracket at the top that snaps over the FastTrack Rail, it is now just a upright with a cutout that hangs over the FastTrack Rail. The Upright is also deeper than the previous ones and the screws the provide are not long enough, they are 2"" screws but when you take into account that the rail is now 1"" deep, your drywall is at least 1/2 to 5/8 inches thick, it doesn't leave much screw to anchor into the studs. I went to and purchase 2 1/2 inch screws for the hardware store. It seems someone at Rubbermaid is not paying attention.I also purchased the 25"" extensions to add onto some of my existing FastTrack Uprights only to find out the extensions are now thicker - 1"" vs the older version of only 3/4"". So I am returning those."
5,GORGEOUS bowls!,"I bought the full set of these bowls as a gift, and ended up ordering myself a set, as well. They were just so beautiful!I use each of them in my kitchen, like the 4oz as my salt bowl, 8oz for sugar packets,...they just add so much color and fun in my kitchen!The quality is wonderful, and the colors are so vivid. And I agree with previous reviewer - it is 2/3 cup. It's going to be a small bowl.I'm sure I will be giving these as a gift again very soon!"
3,Cute little bowl,When I ordered this I didn't realize it was so small. It is cute and has an interesting story about each color but not sure it is worth the price. I use it for paper clips.Nor Pro 2/3 cup Rainbow Colored Wooden Bowl
5,Here are movies listed on picture in this set,"Here are the movies listed in this box setCarrie's WarGoodbye Mr Chipspolly annarailway childrenall excellent movieschfancier""fancier of fine movies"""
2,"UM, WHAT CAN I SAY?","Got this one because I like westerns and I like horror. So when I saw this movie was both, I jumped at it. The reviews weren't good, but I took a chance. I wish I had not! The special effects were laughable, the acting was horrible. The sound quality was bad. The story was kinda stupid. Overall, not a good movie. The DVD cover was misleading."
1,Like a low budget porno...without the porn.,"I watched this movie with my wife. We both enjoy zombie movies and I enjoy westerns as well as cult classics such as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Return of the Living Dead"" so tongue-in-cheek comedic horror is not unwelcome in our DVD collection.Unfortunately this movie failed to deliver. Kane Hodder plays his part well but the rest of the acting is substandard in our book as the characters' interaction is reminiscent of a bad porno movie...without the porn.The soundtrack is awesome as well as the poker game in hell scenes, but if you're seeking a zombie western that in our opinion is worthy of the genre try ""Undead or Alive"" from DarkLot Entertainment.Our favorite zombie horror/comedy movie to date is ""Dawn of the Dead"" from Universal studios."
4,"nice ""monkey"" ring","The monkey ring I received was a disappointment in the fact that the reason I ordered what I thought was a ""set of 3 according to the picture"" was to get the duck ring. It is very well made and the plastic seems strong. Just take care of where it is stored and it should last several years as the ones I have had in the past have. Just buyer beware, you will only get one swim ring, not 3 as the picture shows...and you can't pick which one you get."
2,Deceptive advertising,"The literature for this item is deceptive. We thought we were buying a package with three items in it, but in fact it is ONE package with ONE item in it."
2,Misleading Photo,Buyer Beware...... picture shows set of 3 swim rings and that is what we thought we were going to get. Order came with only the duck ring! Picture is decieving and you do not have a choice on which ring you get! Again buyer beware!
2,Take note this is a SPLIT ring,"I must not have been paying attention when I ordered this as I missed the fact that it is a split ring - ie, not a complete circle but rather the two ends on the ""tail"" end of the animal barely touch. This made it useless for our purpose - we have a 3 year old who is not yet a proficient swimmer, but loves to swim with a full ring float. The split ring was too easy for her to slip out of so she wasn't able to use it. With a kid who is a fully competent swimmer, this might be fine."
1,Be warned..............,Do not pay $60.. 0r $149.00 dollars these are rip off prices...this dvd comes in the mario bava box set that has other 6 titles for a way cheaper price. this dvd is not out of print is is not collectible unless in its box set. Please note that the dvd theses creeps are selling is a slime 99 cent looking case.....buy the original........
2,AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO'S DISAPPOINTED?,This DVD was really disappointing. The concert footage was a near waste due to the horrible audio and poor coverage. Nothing on this DVD was sophisticated. The bad quality really took away from the force behind anti- flag and what a great live band they are. Anti-flag is a good band that deserves a better DVD.
1,Great Band Horrible DVD,"I received this DVD for Christmas and was very excited when I put it in the DVD player. Man was I disappointed to find that the horrific quality made it unlistenable. It isn't that the band doesnt play well, they do, but really it sounds as if some kid had recorded it through his cell phone. The chessy packaging doesnt help. In fact if I didn't know better than I'd swear it was a crappy bootleg because it really feels like it was made by some kid in his basement. This would have been one of the best band DVDs availible, but the lousy quality just ruines it. All Anti-Flag fans should stay away from this."
3,Great Band crappy quality,"This DVD is the first DVD, and I was stoked to have it however the quality sucked. It was like someone recored it on a cam-corder, to me it was ok, I wouldnt have bought knowing this, don't bother getting this."
4,Awesome band....bad audio though,"Awesome dvd from an awesome band...the special features and propaganda on this dvd is great...the video for death of a nation is crazy, i love it, and also for post war breakout...i recommend this dvd to all anti-flag fans...it shows the guys at their best and having fun...brings back flashbacks to their shows...the only reason i gave this dvd 4 stars was becuz the audio wasn't very good, you can't really hear justin or #2 singing very well...but still a good dvd"
4,Must have for professional acupuncturists,"If you are a licensed acupuncturist and treat children at all, this book should be in your collection. The advice and format is not intended for anyone not skilled in TCM."
4,Nice sounding and nice looking product,"I purchased this unit over the Thanksgiving weekend and really like it. It has a very nice, clean sound and is very easy to operate using the SkyFi3 since all functions work through the SkyFi3's remote. My only minor complaint is that when you dock the receiver the volume comes on at a predetermined level, but it's not a big deal. The system looks very nice and has a great sound -- I would highly recommend it. With respect to a previous review, if you want BIG sound for a party or to resonate throughout your house, you'd probably just want the home kit for your receiver and feed it though your home stereo. But for a nice roomfull (or even a couple of roomfulls) of sound, this does a great job."
4,Great product,Lets just say that I was extremely impressed with the audio from this thing. I mean its small but the bass hits hard on the chest and the audio doesnt crack when you turn it up. XM sounds great on it but sound quality depends on your location so some people get better quality than others. Great product if your having a back yard party or something small in the house. Got a lot of compliments for its sound and looks.
4,Good enough for a room full of good sound,"I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Uses it with the XpressRC.It won't rattle the windows but has good quality sound for one room.Buy it while it's on sale, I paid $145.00"
3,Sound quality isn't great....,"This unit is a good table-top unit for an XM receiver. Unfortunately, at higher volume levels, the sound gets tinny and there is no graphic equalizer to fix it other than the bass boost button, which itself is inadequate."
3,A Foolish CD,"I'm not really sure what all the hype is about when it comes to Ashanti. I think she's a good singer, but I expected this CD to be better. I loved all the songs that she was featured in, but whe she came out with this CD, she didn't sound as good as the other ones. I guess I'm wrong since so many people love this CD and she's won many awards. But then again, this is just my opinion. I'm not hatin' on her or anything. I just thought it'd be better, but I still love her."
1,Terrible,"If I could rate this cd less than one star I definitely would.. I burned this cd off of someone.. so thankfully I didn't waste my money but this cd was certifably garbage! Ashanti just can't sing... The only reason she will be able to make it in the industry is because Aaliyah has unfortunately gone on, and there aren't any real teen stars out here right now.. Hopefully Monica's new cd will knock her off! This cd was full of elementary lyrics and songs. Most of them lacked substance and her immaturity shone through on all of these tracks.. Ashanti fooled us with Foolish.. because I will admit that song was hot, so that led people to believe her cd would be nice.. but it wasn't! The only good songs are foolish, unfoolish, over and leaving.. The rest is horrible.. I would save my money and pick up a good cd like Tweet, Aaliyah, or Alicia Keyes!"
5,Best songs and good beats,"Ashanti's album ""ASHANTI"" is a good cd. IT about relationship in our life. This cd is about men and women sex appeal. I love 9 of her songs from album. ""FOOLISH"",""HAPPY"",""LEAVING""(ALWAYS ON TIME PT II),""CALL"",""RESCUE"",""BABY"",""OVER"",""UNFOOLISH"",""DREAMS"" Those songs are very good and tight beats.Plus I also like ""BABY""(REMIX)/FEATURE CROOKED I,""BABY""(REMIX)/FEATURE SCARFACE AND ""HAPPY""(REMIX)/FEATURE CHARLI BALITMORE"
3,ASHANTI PRINCESS?MAYBE,"I LIKE SOME OF HER SONGS SPEACILLY ""HAPPY"" SHE HAS TALENT AND SHE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGERS BUT I WOULDN'T CALL HER THE NEW PRINCESS OF HIP HOP AND R&B THE CD IS KIND OF GOOD IT WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED BUT IT WASN'T BAD"
3,It's ok!,"I remember at one point there was a lot of hype surrounding Ashanti...but after listen to the album....I was like....this isn't even worth all that recognition.Yes this CD has a couple of good songs but that's it. Amerie has better songs on her CD than this. I guess people got the CD because of Ashanti is on the cover...and I don't understand that because shes not looking so good with the ""Nappy Side Burns""!!!...it is good enough for a listen..."
4,Pretty Good,"This CD was exceptionally well done especially for a first album. I don't understand why alot of the fans dislike Ashanti's music, since her album is really well done, although her singing ability did not shine through as expected. The songs are catchy, have good beats, and have interesting and original lyrics. The album is overall very entertaining and the songs ranged from casual to intense."
3,Radio-friendly mix.......,"I seen and heard it before, OVEREXPOSURE. Ashanti first burst on the scene with a sample on Big Pun's final album.Since then she hasn't ceased to deliver top 5 singles, whether singing on them or writing them(J. LO's Ain't It Funny Remix). ""Always on Time"" hit #1, What's Luv is currently #2, and ""Foolish"" is currently #1. With those kind of numbers she was sure to be an overnight success. Her album just debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, with 500,000 + sold the same week her single ""Foolish"" hit #1 on the 100. She is a contender for best new artist.However, you get your everyday R&Bsongs; with nice flavor.No new ground is broken and her topic throughout the album remains leaving, staying, waiting, and taking no BS.Expect to hear extensions of ""Foolish"" on the album. The best songs are:1.Foolish2.Leaving3.Happy4.Unfoolish5.Baby6.Scared"
1,movies,"I only like the song movies and come to think of it, she's doing movies now and is so much likeable in that field instead of music. She should stick to making movies and maybe writing songs but as far as singing and performing, hell to the no!"
1,Overrated!!,"First of all nobody is saying the girl does not have a voice. The problem is that there are a lot more artists out here that can't get noticed because the wonderful record companies will take someone and exploit them to the fullest. Secondly she won the Aretha Franklin award in her first year when she did not deserve it. There were other artists that should have won that that had paid their dues. You can't just listen to ""Radio Artists"". There are other artists out that don't get airplay that are 10 times better than her. I hate those videos that exploit women and men like they do. Just booty shakers and cheaters and drug dealers. That is why I hate a bunch of these videos for that."
3,Well.... way better than chapter II!,This is a good CD. Not the best but a good CD. Some cool beats some time check this album out.
3,NOT QUITE ON AALIYAH'S LEVEL YET.......,"it seems to me that Ashanti is here to replace AALIYAH, which can never happen cuz AALIAYH IS 'ONE IN A MILL' AND 'MORE THAN A WOMAN'....While Ashanti is 'FOOLISH', 'HAPPY' AND 'AVERAGE'....her vocie can be great on certai tracks, but not always.....the cd sounds the same and the production isnt that great either.the best tracks on this disc include...'FOOLISH', HAPPY, LEAVING* (IT'S GREAT, ALWAYS ON TIME,PART 2), SCARED, MOVIES AND RESCUE...after those songs stand out, everything else is blended togeter..one thing i hate about Murder Inc. and Ashanti's cd, dispite the good music include TOO MANNY SKITSSSSSS!!!!!!!THAT'S Y THE CDS ARENOT LONG...ESP. ASHANTI......she does have a promising career, so let's wait for the sophmore cd....until then ASAHNTI'S 'FOOLISH', 'SCARED', HAPPY self can 'LEAV(ING)'..."
2,a couple hit singles......thats about it.....,"Ashanti is a perfect example of how far people in the industry will go just to make money, whether you have talent or not! Sure she's good for singing hooks, just hooks!!! No more albums please! She has this soft voice thats anything but powerful, but yet she's the princess of hip hop and r&b??? I don't think so!!! She's like the Britney Spears of hip hop-no singing talent whatsoever, but too much media attention! Give the credit and attention to the real divas with voices and talent like Christina Aguilera and Beyonce!!!"
2,This isn't music; this is hype.,"There's been a lot of hype behind Ashanti, but not much in the way of talent. Her debut release proves that, when armed with the right marketing campaign, you can sell anything to the masses. It's not that these songs are necessarily bad, but they could easily be sung by Brandy, Monica, Pink, TLC, 702, and the rest of the seemingly interchangable female r&b acts out there. Lots of beats and rhythm, but no personality. Ashanti should thank her lucky stars that she dropped her material at the right time, because under any other circumstance, this CD couldn't have been successful as it is. To the uninitiated: save your cash and grab Angie Stone, India.Arie, or the Queen of Hip Hop Soul herself, Mary J. Blige. These women perform music far more substantial than this."
3,Great! But could be better!,"This is a GREAT CD! But theres some parts were they could be better. I felt like almost all the songs were slow and had no uptempo. But all the songs have GREAT lyrics and her voice is so great! She has like all her songs are from the hreat. They all mean something personal. Not to everyone or every song but they are the best songs! And thats why they call her the ""Princess of Hip-Hop and R&B""! This is a great CD to listen to at home while chillin. I would suggest getting this CD! It might be the best CD or the wrote and I think its one of the best for me."
2,Not all it is claimed to be,"Ashanti's debut cd is not all that great. The songs are very simple and are just plain for a so-called r&b princess that is on top of the charts. Foolish is what made me buy it. I thought it was going to be so good since it was on top of the charts. When I bought it, I skipped most of the songs on the cd. The only songs i favor are baby, thank you, dreams, and movies. All I have to say is listen to the cd first before you buy it."
4,The same old topics with a little Murder Inc. twist.,"Okay, if you heard the first single ""Foolish"", then that's probably the reason you bought this album. the other tracks that stand out are ""Leaving (always on time pt.2)"" with Ja, Scared feat. Irv Gotti and Over. Those are my favorites. This album basically talks about the same thing we always hear, relationships gone bad, but I do respect the fact that she wrote all her own songs on her first album. I also actually like ""Unfoolish"" which is just an answer to the first single. It's over all a pretty good album and I would recommend it. It has that Foolish feel through out the entire thing so if you liked that then you'll probably like some of the other cuts."
2,Ashanti,"Don't get me wrong; I think she has a future ahead of her. She seems as though she's going to be here to stay...and I hope she is. I feel as though Ashanti has a lot of potential. However, the reason why I gave this cd 2 stars is because I honestly believe that these songs were not created for the more ""mature"" music fans. This cd will(is) popular with the 15-24 set. I am 24 years old....so I guess that maybe that's pushing it. Everything on this cd has been sampled before...one way or the other. I guess Irv Gotti forgot that this is supposed to be a R&B cd; not Rap. To me, Ashanti penned lyrics to songs that she may have heard on the radio. There is NOTHING original about this cd. I like substance with my music; this apparently is NOT the cd for me. Honestly, I prefer Tweet over Ashanti. This is not to take away from Ashanti....I think she can go far. But I honestly believe that she needs to improve her songwriting skills....a lot of songs sound ""bubblegum""."
2,Yuck:P,"I am gonna have to say this CD [stinks]! I mean I cannot even listen past ""foolish"" the rest is off kilter beats and really not the greatest singing. Oh well I have different taste. But honestly if you like AAliyah, don't even bother with this CD. There is NO comparisons. I only gave it two stars because I like ""foolish"""
2,Princess of Hip-Hop R&B? Hardly.,"Ms. Ashanti is a mediocre singer with mediocre lyrics with mediocre production with a lot of hype. Don't let the hype fool you! The only songs that stand out are ""Dream"" and ""Movies"". There is no way in the world she can be put in the same category as [other singer], the comparisons are laughable. [other singer]isn't the best singer or lyricist, but she more than make ups for her deficiencies with energy and spirit. The same can not be said for Ashanti. In fact, she is very bland. She is not giving the listener her all, but what she thinks is enough to get by [which in this business is reduced to a cute face, sexy body, and the right (read popular) people around you]. If I'm going to spend my hard earned dollars, I expect more."
5,Ashanti,i have bought at least three copies of this album since it came out and this is one of my favorite cds the sad thing is that cds sales are just going down for her and i don't understand why when she has talent i love this whole album and it's worth your time and money if you don't already have my favorite songs on this album is: 1.foolish 2.leaving 3.rescue 4.movies 5.unfoolish
2,excuse me...but this isn't music.,"how can i put it politely...forget it. i cant be polite after having the misfortune of buying this load of garbage that Ashanti and the Inc folks beset on me. Out of everything on the cd the only two songs that i remotely liked ""Foolish"" and ""Unfoolish"" one using BIG's song for a sample and the other was just alright. Out of 17 songs (including a few lame as heck skits) that were better left on the cutting room floor. Having to listen Irv Gotti his way through a song as a featured artist is torturous enough. If i ever wonder why i didnt like Ashanti all i need to do is look at the cd cover and all those horrible songs will come back to me...unfortunately.This isn't purchase worthy or download worthy either except for the two aforementioned songs. Sorry Ashanti...strike 1 please try again at a later time."
5,The Beautiful Ashanti,"So far I'm surprised about this album,also I'm surprised about her too.The first thing I noticed about her was that her name used to be a name of one of Aferica's old countrys before they changed it.Second I notice that she adds a lot of emotions in her songs and she has found her real voice.Plus she looks very young.And I bet you don't know what know.Ashanti almost threw this album away because she didn't want a big hit.But she stuck with it and us people have some good music to jam too.Also I noticed that she is featured in a lot of other albums Like Fat Joe ""What's Love"" and Ja Rule ""always on time"".I like Ashanti and you should too."
3,ashanti album,"To be honest i only bought this cd because of the singles, ""Fooloish"" and ""Unfoolish"" I will say that i was not surprised from what i heard. When i first purchased this cd I hated it, but after listening to it for a while it grows on you. To be honest the only good songs are ""over"", ""scared"", ""leaving"", and ""rescue""( plus the singles(except ""happy"")). I personally think calling her the ""princess of R&B"" is overrated ... I use to say she had an alright voice but after bet awards I had to think twice, ...that was horrible, and to be honest if you think about it she can't dance either all she does is sway from side to side and plays with her hair(what the hell is that!) she need to take some dance lessons from Janet Jackson, Mya, and Aaliyah. After the summer that cd will be OLD news, and after a while she will be too. I'm just waiting on MYA to come back the REAL ""Princess of R&B and Hip-Hop"""
3,ASHANTI YOU CANT COMPETE WITH TWEET,"I THINK THIS CD IS GOOD,BUT SOME OF THE SONGS WERE WACK AS HELL. I THINK I LIKE ""HAPPY"",""FOOLISH"" AND SOME OF THE OTHER SONGS TOO. I THINK IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE A SONG TITLED ""FOOLISH AND ONE TITLED ""UNFOOLISH"". I LIKE TWEETS ALBUM BETTER ,BUT ASHANTI IS PUTTING HOT TRACKS DOWN TOO."
3,BE ORIGINAL,"Songs like Baby, Rescue Me, and Dreams shows off Ashanti's vocal ability and are jams that you won't be able to get out of your head. Most tracks on the album are just taken from the styles of Aaliyah, Alicia Keys and many others. If you do buy this album just keep your receipt handy at all times."
2,Not the greatest,"Yea i liked the song ""Foolish"" and the remix ""Unfoolish"" but the album aint worth your money. Only one or two of the songs are ok but the others seem like the same song and aint that good. Yea shes pretty and all but hell the cd aint worth it at all."
1,TOO MUCH HYPE,I never liked the song foolish but people were making a bunch of hype over Ashanti's CD. I thought maybe there would be one or two songs I could listen to but basically she is dry. So what she used the track for Biggie's 'one more chance.' The truth is if she never used that track people wouldn't be playing the song so much. I'd much rather listen to the original any day. The other songs are somewhat [tired] and her writing skills can use a little work. It takes more than singing hooks on real artist like Ja Rule for me to be impressed.
2,Foolish?...You Bet,"Ashanti is a very talented singer with a pretty voice. Unfortunately this album does not deliver. I borrowed it from a friend and I only enjoyed 2 songs ""Foolish"" and ""Leaving"". She needs to get better producers that can write better songs that reflect her vocal skills. She also very good at singing hooks on other artists songs maybe she should stick to singing hooks until she gets better songs to sing. Just buy the singles, but if you are ""Foolish"" then by all means buy this album."
3,Can't Believe,"This CD is ""sick""...meaning good. I couldn't believe how surprised i was when i heard this cd. ""Foolish"" is not even the best of the cd. Irv Gotti and the whole murder inc., really did well for this album. I love the beats, the music, and the topics she sings about. Ashanti, is the ""new"" young female artists that all young females can relate to ages 18-24. She sings about what all of us go through as young women in search of happiness with a relationship at that age.Although this cd is good and entertaining, but that's all entertainment. Ashanti does have an aight voice, but she's no singer. The cd is a whole package, you can't just single out her voice.I give this cd 3 stars, cause it's just entertainment, and I love the beats. My favs are: ""Leaving.."", ""Rescue"", ""Call"", ""Over"", ""Baby"", and ""Foolish"".(6 out of 13 songs, not half bad Ashanti)"
5,Ashanti's words came right out of my life.,"You know how there are certain times in your life when you pop in a cd and all of a sudden the song that comes on is exactly what's going on in your life at that exact moment? I ordered this cd a week ago or so and it got here Friday night, I am going through stuff with my man and i put this cd on, WOW! Ashanti is the bomb, The song ""Over"" has feelings so intense, ""I can't believe that it's over baby, every bruise on my heart you gave me, see we tried, and we fight, and we cried, now it's over Baby, it's over baby"" When I first heard the ""Foolish"" song I thought yeah that's pretty tyte, even though I don't really care for remakes (de barge part), but this girl can really sing and write. She is my #1 right now, she knows what I'm feeling and I'm glad to have her cd. Ladies, if you got a man that aint treating you like he should, you best buy this cd and listen to what o' girl has to say. EXCELLENT CD!!!WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!"
2,IF YOU'RE UNDER 15 YEARS OF AGE THEN THIS ALBUM IS FOR YOU,"I was very hesitant about purchasing Ashanti's album, and I must say I wish I never did make the final decisions to purchase it. My [money]could've went to some 'real' musicians and artists around in this industry.This album is strictly for the younger generation of teenagers, because I was definitely not feeling it. The track ""Foolish"" is now played out and her track ""Baby"" is a bitin' background instrumentation from Scarface's, ""Mary"" and she just replaced his chorus with her elementary ABC lyrics. I suggest you all purchase Tweet's album instead if not her's, Jaguar Wrights...it's waaaayyyy more worth the [money]. Peace."
2,Uninspired...Infantile...Immature,"As I swiftly handed over the hard earned money that I occasionally seem to waste (see above), I had not a high, or even medium, expectation regarding quality of music, but I did expect at least a few redeeming qualities. No folks, there are none to be had.I will hand it to Ashanti for penning many of her own tracks (co-writer credits aside), but honestly, what middle school graduate couldn't write such lyrically immature tracks as ""Happy"" or ""Foolish"" (not to exclude the rest of the album)?I gave this album 2 stars, not that it deserves such high marks, but because the cover is sort of cute, in a pre-pubescent sort of way.To conclude this tirade on the cute, but all around immature, Murder Inc. puppet, if you're a fan of pseudo-R&B;/pop fodder, you will find yourself at home with ""Ashanti."""
4,"A little overrated, but overall, a good album","This was a good album, but I disliked the fact that she relied on many male rappers to produce the songs. And her voice gets a little tiresome after a while. But I like her voice in small doses, and at least she writes her own songs and can sing. All in all, a good album but don't pay a lot for this."
2,Wasnt all that good,"To me Ashanti album isnt all that good. There's like maybe 3 songs out of 17 that i like, and that is ""Foolish"", ""Scared"", and ""Movies"". The whole album is basically fillers. I think ""Foolish"" mislead alot of people thinking its going be an hot album. So i wouldnt recommand anyone to get this album."
2,NOWHERE NEAR PERFECT BUT ITS ALRIGHT,"IF i had to sum this album up in one word it would be OVERATED...this album should not have sold three million nowher enear..Personally Ashanti could have done way better..She can sing but she has no Monica,Beyonce or Kelly voice but she can hold a note well....This album is way too simple and bland...songs they just sound simple...""CALL""..RESCUE....HAPPY..FOOLISh..come on step up ya game mami......she stepped it up on her secodn album but only half the songs were good......"
1,SHE NEEDS ALOT OF WORK.,This album is just horrid and poorly made.She is simply a pretty face with mediocre at best vocals.The music on ths album is just okay but gets annoying after a while.She is in dire need of better song writing ability and more singing lessons because she is just not cutting it.AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!
2,Not A Hater.. but this is not worth money,"First off let me say... that Ashanti really cannot sing that well, her voice is not up to standard. The first track Foolish was my fav song, but as soon as I heard the cd i was like no. The songs have no meaning, no depth to them. She couldn't think of anything better to say. Like on the track Baby (You're like a lighter to my cigrarette, watch me smoke) what the heck is that. and she just doesn't stand good with this album. She should not be called the princess when their are so many better artist out there... she is going to have to do better."
3,IT IS OK,ADVICE: from a fan..Ashanti is a coo singer..she should get some coaching so she can play wiht her vocal range...o n her secnd album she sounds the sam as this one...this album is full of ELEMENATARY lyrics and songs....i think you should practice singing and some writing skills....Explore open up ur mind and dont limit the skillz..GIRL PEOPLE BUYIN YA ALBUM..now GIVE US SOMETHING ACTUALLY WORTH LISTENING TOtired of the comaprions to AALIYAH....nowhere near..u wanna be compared to her...let playa tim and missy writ ur songs..at leat they wrote her some REAL REAL SONGS>>>>that showed her as a mature woman not a little girl
1,aint a hater,nothing special she thinks shes all that and better than everyone (including aaliyah) i aint got notin else 2 say besides shes a biach
3,It's not that bad...really it isn't,"Truth be told, I'm much more of an Aaliyah fan than Ashanti. As a matter of fact, I didn't buy this cd, my sister did; however, it's really not bad. Ashanti's cd is what a few artists previously have attempted...(Think Mya, Lil Mo). Only thing is where they've failed, Ashanti has scored. The beats are strictly street, but tunes like ""Scared"", ""Rescue"", and ""Movies"" have got a romantic touch with its selected instrumentation.""Happy"" has great music, and ""Baby"" is very catchy as well as the ""Foolish"" and ""Unfoolish"" songs, but ""Leaving"" should've been left in the studio... yes it's that bad. Most girls under 24 and more infatuated with boys than they've ever been will appriciate this."
3,"""ASHANTI""- FROM A 12-YEAR-OLD'S POINT OF VIEW","Ok, first of all, I'm 12 years old and I have the explicit version so umm yeah...well I think it's pretty good if you like slow music. There's no real hip-hop on here, just R&B. And if you're getting the explicit version it basically talks about sex and cusses."
3,It's okay,"Let me just start off by saying that I respect that this girl has written her whole album. I've overheard people say that her lyrics aren't that great, but I say she's 21, she has time to grow! Her voice on the other hand is weak and as the cd go's on get's a little monotonous. The tracks that are worth giving a listen to are in my opinion are Foolish, Leaving, Scared, Rescue, and Unfoolish. Thank You is awful. She needs vocal training."
3,addition to the collection,"I like this C.D. alright. With any c.d i like some songs better than others. Although she is one of my top ten female artist I felt that she was trying to prove she could sing with Thank you(I love the song though). This is a nice album to have in the collection or give to a teenager for a gift. Also to get over your cheating, and lying boyfriend"
4,Stop fronting She's fly,"I think Ashanti is pretty and talented some people say she can't sing but I think otherwise. I am a female too and people are always hatin so overall Ashanti is fly. The fact that she's on Murda Ink makes it even more fly.They are one of the best record labels out there right now because they show that they stick together like a family which is what we need in the industry right now. I am a huge Nas fan and word on the street is he might sign with Murda Ink(because he dosent want to renew his contract with Columbia) Him, Ja, Irv, Charli, Vita and Ashanti all have different styles and right now diversity is needed. HOLLA"
3,"Ashanti ? the princess of hip-hop and r&b, i don't think so.","Ashanti 's album was nice. But I feel that she think she is Aaliyah, the true princess of hip-hop and r&b and that the music industry is blowing her up like she was the first female artist since Mary J. Blige to sing under hip-hop syncabated beats and actually it was Aaliyah not Ashanti and also she can not sing in real life. The only reason the music industry is blowing her up is for the simple fact that Aaliyah is gone, but if she was still alive wouldn't nobody be thinking about Ashanti. She can sing better than J-Lo, but she doesn't have a singing voice. When it comes to writing songs she is excellent. Singing, no way."
4,Ashanti - The HATERS will make u stronger!,"Y'all haters make me laugh. Y'all have been hatin since her album dropped and she already sold 3 million in the U.S. and 6 million worldwide. Y'all are pointless. The album is still hot to date and her albums to come will be even hotter, so sit back and enjoy!"
3,totally average,"Ok,Ashanti isn't that bad,folks.She's not amazing either.There isn't much dimension to her as a singer, she sings about the same issues,(love,ralationships,love gonne bad,playas,), and her music is pretty simple.The everyday hip hop/r n'b beats,same radio friendly hooks, and melodies.Her voice is pleasant, but is again nothing special.With better material, Ashanti could become a more credible aritist.A lot of the songs are filler, and seem to be just thrown together.Also, there isn't much variety, a lot of the songs sound the same.So, all in all, this isn't a bad cd, but there is no reason to get stuck on Ashanti, there are many young artists out there who show a lot more depth and individuality."
2,the best track so far,"i thinks is the best tract so far,it shows alot of inspirational feelings.if only the record can sale in the world for more buyers.i will pick up a million out of it."
4,like ashanti best.,"this album of ashanti has been the most beautiful album i never dreamt of hearing.With songs written with ja rule,fat joe, and also j'lo.She has ben the second to have 3 songs in the music chart the same week....."
2,Disappointment,"I am really sorry for writing this review. I honestly do not like bashing artists because i truly respect what they do. and i do respect Ashanti but the album is WEAK.For the exceptions of ""foolish/unfoolish"", ""scared"", ""happy"" and ""always on time part II""..there is nothing on this album. It gets so boring at times...you can't even hear what she's singing about. I used to like ""baby"", i love the beat and lyrics but that chorus is just too annoying.I feel so bad for waisting my money on this album. I'm usually lucky when i buy full length albums cuz i usually like almost all the songs but my luck run out on this one.Sorry to say but this young lady has been getting way too much recongition and praise for this album. Yeah, ""foolish"" might have been off the hook but the rest of the album truly kills everything."
4,My ratings on her album..,"She isnt the best singer,but she did an o-k job on this album,some of her songs is nice..Heres what I rate dem....1.Intro-2,Foolish-4 stars3.Happy-4 stars4.Leaving(Always on time)-4 1/2 stars5.Narrative Call(skit)-6.Call-3 stars7.Scared- 3 stars8.Rescue-4 1/2 stars9.Baby-5 stars10.Voodoo-4 stars11.Movies-3 stars12.Fight(over skit)-13.Over-5 stars14.Unfoolish- 4 1/2 stars15.Shi Shi(skit)16.Dreams- 5 stars17.Thank you- 4 1/2 stars"
2,MORE ORIGINALITY!!,"When i bought Ashanti i had to keep an open mind, after all, we lost sum great voices in the past months. ashanti has a beautiful voice, and though soft, she has potential, but it would of been nice if she used sum ORIGINAL BEATS and not borrow from sum dead rappers we know. but all in all, it was the voice that got me to listen without prejudice, but ashanti? Little sister, get sum original beats, you can do well without a familiar beat....."
4,"Although Overexposed, It's A Good Debut","Like every female artist that breaks out in the music world, Ashanti is a pretty face and there is no denying that. But with her debut album, she proves that she's more than that. Take one listen and you will discover immediately that the blueprint for this album is nothing new to the blueprint of several hip-hop/soul albums of the early '90s. It's basically just singing over recycled hip-hop beats. Been there, done that. And while I feel that the marketing scheme is over the top(as well as my ""serious-as-a-heart attack"" disagreement of her label, Murder Inc. crowning her the ""Princess Of Hip-Hop/R&B""), her album is good if you love to sing along to it."
2,If there's nothing else...,"I would not recommend anything by Ashanti to a person seeking well written songs and/or a talented performer. Nothing associated with her is much more than OK. ""Foolish"" was just way too overplayed- every woman in town was singing it with false emotions like the song was real. ""Happy"" and the song after it are just horrible. It was bad enough hearing her voice on those interludes, but that guy was even worse! I could have enjoyed the sound of ""Call"" and ""Rescue Me"" without the background noises of sirens and trains, respectively. Something about the production of these songs made her sound even worse. ""Baby"" had a nice beat for an R&B slow jam but there is no real high point of it all. It was worth borrowing or burning a copy."
2,skip this cd...,"When I heard Foolish and Unfoolish on the radio, I thought this CD was going to be a great one. However, when I bought it, I was very disappointed. Ashanti's voice is no reason to be calling her ""the Princess of Hip-Hop and R&B"" (by the way, have you heard this girl sing live?... it is NOT pretty at all!!!) There are some songs that are worth listening to (Foolish, Unfoolish, Scared, and Baby)... but three of those songs already receive major airplay and the other is actually nothing to go crazy over. Also, the sequel to Always on Time (Leaving, which features Ja Rule) is a pretty good track. All-in-all, this is not a CD I would recommend if you have about $... you want to put to good use."
3,cute but boring,"Ashanti's new album has some cool tracks on it, but she seems to be talking about the same thing in almost every song, it gets boring after awhile, I mean for the young(teens)this album will probably be a classic, but for those of us that are 25 and older, you might find yourself digging for another cd to pop in before your head busts open. Personally, she has a sweet voice and she is the one that made the ""What's luv"" single jam, but she surely wont be taking anybody's place(Aaliyah) by self-proclaiming herslf the princess of hiphop and r&b.. we all know only one female will hold that title in our hearts forever"
3,Ashanti is not the princess of hip hop/r&b,"When Ashanti first came out with Ja Rule on his smash ""Always On Time"",I really felt Ashanti.I also felt her no.1 ""Foolish"",but then Ashanti got played out.Now I can't stand Ashanti!I hated ""Happy"" and I also hated ""Baby"".Even when I know everyone calls her ""the princess of hip hop/r&b"", I know Aaliyah is really the true princess.Aaliyah left a legacy that will be forever remembered,if Ashanti died tomorrow,I wouldn't like it,but i'd still say Aaliyah is the true princess of hip hop/r&b."
3,Average,"I didn't expect much from this debut album and I didn't get much so I guess I can't be disappointed...right? She definitely has a nice talent and a nice voice. Once her voice matures a bit and she gets better material to sing, I think she'll do well and we can look forward to better things. But as for this album, superstar guest appearances from Ja and Big, and samples are just what she needed. The 25 and under will love this CD."
1,THEY GIVE RECORD DEALS AWAY NOW,"OMG. this cd is sooo bad.JUST WHY DID IT DO SO WELL?? - HYPE&A FEW HIT SINGLES.SHE CANNOT SING PEOPLE.IM SORRY TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE.SHE IS NO WHITNEY OR ARETHA OR MARY J.BLIGE.ITS JUST EMBARRASING TO R&B.AT THE 2002 BET AWARDS,I THOUGHT SHED CHOKE.(at least she didnt lipsing.)DO NOT PURCHASE BY ALL MEANS!! ASHANTI,GO HAVE SEX WITH THAT LOSER JA RULE AND LEAVE THE RECORD INDUSTRY IMMEDIATLEY!"
2,Princess of what????,"Ashanti has been given a title she can not live up to. Her album is okay but, it's not the greatest out right now. Some of the songs have a nice flow to them but I think she's far from a princess."
4,Thats my girl,"She may not be Aaliyah, or Alicia Keys,but she close enough.That girl got a voice on her,and she seem like a down to earth person.I know she love working with the murder inc family.I wish I was her cause I would enjoy every moment.I love her songs,especially Foolish.I felt where she was coming from because I was in relationship like the one she was in and its really hard for you to let someone go after you have loved someone for a long time.She is great I would recommend everyone to get her cd"
2,"It was aiight, but not much more!","Foolish like Ashanti's other albums are mostly the production. Ashanti is considered to be the Britany Spears of R&B, b/c both had heavy promotion in their records to make them stars. Well Ashanti isn't much of a singer, but she a looker, but this album did little to touch me with people like...Christina Aguilera, Whitney Houston, Mariah carey, Alica Keys, India arie, and some others. Ashanti is there but she is just not up to par."
1,yep...music is on its death bed especially with ashanti.....,"ashanti is just terrible... she is a beat taking, think she can sing, oscar the grouch looking thing that cannot sing if god told her too...there is only one song that was desent on this album (I HATE TO SAY).... 'leaving' was okay... but the whole album SUCKS!!!!!why is chubacca making us buy her music...PEOPLE DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE THAT IS WHY THE MUSIC BUSINESS IS GOING DOWNHILL.. we must prevent crap like this....-unfinity stars out of 5 stars.... their is no number on this earth to give this review..."
3,somebody lied to her,"this is the princess of rap/r&b? ugh please!! somebody ... to her big time. although she did write all of the songs by herself, that don't let her off the hook. she samples endlessly and it seems like she uses the same vocal arrangements for every song. there are a few exceptions, though. ""movies"", ""happy"", and ""baby"" are alright songs. if you are looking for some real soul singing, look elsewhere. for example: [...]"
5,"Ashanti, do yo thang!","This girl has it goin' on! She is blowin' up for real. I am definitely feelin' the CD. I listen to 2,3,6, and 14, but the whole thing is off the hook. I just wanna give Shanti her props and good luck..."
3,ho-hum,"Is it just me, or does everybody sound like someone else? Doesn't Ashanti sound like Monifah (especially on ""Foolish"") Maybe I'm being too hard but this isn't nothing new. I love originality and uniqueness but I just can't seem to find it these days. Yes, she has songs that are nice, some are even really good, but nothing that warrants five stars from me. She's cool and she will go a long way because this type of music is the norm for now."
2,Not impressed,The case was cracked and I really don't think it's new. And the wrapping look rewrapped. I will not buy again
4,Ashanti - Ashanti,"I'm writing this from an ""I told you so"" perspective. Way back in 2002, when Ashanti first came out, I told friends and family THIS would be her best album. I just saw all of the creative juices coming together just ONE time. Lo and behold, some nine years later, this is STILL Ashanti's best album. Grant you, she never did achieve the kind of success I thought she would. A lot of things factored into that (limited range, fly-by-night label, poor marketing), but this is Ashanti her the best (whatever that means).There were a lot of hits on the album. The insanely catchy ""Foolish"", the poppy ""Happy"", the ridiculously infectious ""Baby"", and ""Dreams"". I didn't care for the album tracks much on this record, but I will say Ashanti did redeem herself with album track quality the next time out.Overall, Ashanti did well her first time out. Actually, this WAS her best effort. It went downhill from there."
3,Her Best CD!!,"I'm a big fan of Ashanti and I think that her first album is her best!! Everybody likes to diss on Ashanti but personally I think she's better than all the female r&b; singers out there besides keyshia cole, mariah carey, and mary j blige!!Here's my top 5 favorite songs from this album:1) Leaving (always on time pt II) *best song on the album*2) Over3) Baby4) Unfoolish5) Foolish"
2,"Ashanti is infact one of those singers that can only do good on stage, but in the studio, no, no","For a debut album I can say not that bad but still not good. The only song on their that I like is Happy, and that's not even all that great. I think she was blown way out of proportion than how her talent really is."
2,she aint really all that,"foolish is a remake of biggie's one more chance, but the video is nice. Baby is a feel good song but only for a minute and sounds like a j lo reject song. Movies is a nice jam, I love the music for it, that's about it with ashanti. Her lyric writing skills are alright but her voice is weak."
2,Save your money,The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of Happy everything else [stinks]. She is a studio singer with a weak voice. You could have put most people in the studio and came out with the same results her voice is weak.
3,Ashanti,Ashanti is a very talented singer who shows alot of emotion and feelings into her songs. Especially on the song foolish. She has a very beautiful voice. Unlike Brandy she's only had 1 hit song in about 2-3 yrs.
2,Oy vay...Here we go again!!,"Argh...here we go again with another TALENTLESS girl trying to make her mark in the Pop/R&B world. I mean, really! Her voice is only somewhat decent. I know tons of people that sing much better then her, but they don't go start doing solo acts! It's all about her looks. I mean, come on..tell me you don't like ""Foolish"" mainly because of the music? I certainly did. She sounds like Aaliyah on a *really* bad day. It's time all these Mya clones vanished out of the scene. I tell ya'll she won't be up for any grammy's this upcoming year. Sorry peeps but Ashanti's claim to fame is only due to her connections with Murda Inc (which is composed mainly of no talent rappers *coughs* ja rule). Seriously, you're better off buying from newcomer Tweet, or India Ariae. At leased they have some promise and are a breath of fresh air in this depressing world of manufactured cookie cutter R&B."
1,Established herself here as one of the leading poster children for artistic irrelevance,"One of the least talented singers ever to be majorly successful, I still shake my head in disbelief when I think of how Ashanti became a household name with this album. Two fundamental errors that should have killed both the album and her career are as follows: She sounds too much like many singers that have come both before and after her, and the majority of her recorded output is built upon samples (with little or no effort made to keep this from being overly apparent). Reportedly, Ashanti is a very skilled cook; if she wants well-deserved fame perhaps a cooking show would be more her type of thing."
1,She sucks...,"...and not just because she's affiliated with Ja Rule. She sucks even MORE, in my book. This girl couldn't sing to save her life. On almost every single song - but most noticable on ""Foolish"", ""Call"", ""Rescue"", ""Baby"", ""Movies"" and ""Over"" - she can't even hold out a note. If she tries to, she'll make her voice go very soft, as if to keep it from squeaking. It just sounds terrible. Also, you can hear her big, long deep breaths in between every few words. And that's not a good thing, because professional singers are supposed to know how to breathe when they sing. Their breaths should be silent (Christina Aguilera's singing style, for example).And that's why she's a garbage singer. She doesn't know how to sing professionally and her lyrics have no depth at all. Thank you for your time."
2,"Well, here's why it got 2 stars from me.","I just bought ""Concrete Rose"" and loved it. I went online and saw this one and saw the ""Explicit lyrics"" label and stopped instantly, saying to myself, 'Ashanti? Why, girl? You are NOT an explicit artist! It's not your style!' Then I just decided, hey, why don't I at least see how it sounds, and so I went and got it. I'm not impressed just like I thought I wouldn't be. Sorry, fans. This isn't her strongest work yet.- Brian Rodrego Morrison"
1,New Princess of Hip Hop?,"I heard her hype before I heard her CD. She sounded good enough with Ja Rule (then again how hard is it to stay on pitch singing a hook)so I rushed to buy it. Production was cool, but when I heard her sing, I was reminded of a talent show. Dental work is less painful than her voice."
3,GOOD ALBUM....NOTHING SPECTACULAR,"Murder Inc.'s Ashanti's album consists of many average songs.The lead single,""Foolish"" is a single Mary J.Blige would be proud of-too much drama! She livens things up on ""Happy"",where she sings about being happily in love.After that things go downhill.Most of the songs are pleasant to listen to,but they are'nt outstanding.She makes an effort with ""Movies"",which is a nice slow jam.Granted,she has a great voice,but the practice of sampling other people's tracks makes her album lack originality and her skits are unnecessary."
1,GARBAGE,"Yuk! It's a shame how people try to make money off of other people's tracks. And if you're gonna do it, do it right. This entire album is what the weak debut title track says. ""Foolish""And how dare them give her an ""Aretha Franklyn Lady of Soul Award"" for this CD. What disrespect. Not one track on this CD lives up to any of Aretha's hundreds of songs. A total waste of CD rapping. ""Let's start over Ashanti."" You have the look, but definitely not the voice. Focus more on acting,dancing, a cloths line, something. Even you're own cook show. Not singing."
3,Bored....,"What can i say? I loved ashanti, everything she was doing and singing, and then i got the cd. She can sing done get me worng but the cd left me feeling bored. Maybe i excepted more up tempo type songs which i didnt get. All the singles she has released are great and the only thing worth bying, i hope that the next cd is better and shows off her true talent."
2,very over-rated,"Ashanti's debut album was very succesful.... I don't know why because I heard it and heard it and heard it and I still have to realize how can anyone think it's a good album. There is ONE good song and that's ""OVER"". All the songs sound the same, talk about the same damn things (""oh baby i love you, ""baby why did you break my heart"", blah blah blah).... Ashanti is beautiful but she can't sing and her lyrics are very childish. But I give her 2 stars and not 1 because even though it's a bad album, I think she can do better."
3,It's not what it claims to be,"I like Ashanti don't get me wrong but I love Tweet's album better. This album is more for the ""teenager"" crowd."
3,Not much of a princess.....,"Her voice is scratchy when left without all the hip hop beats pumping from the background to cover her lack of a voice. She tries to hard too be ""smooth"", but falls short and ends up scretching through the whole ""Thank You"" song. My advice: Get some voice lessons. The songs lyrics are catchy, but repetitive. They are those perfect songs for you and your girlfriends to sing along to as you paint each other nails. I'm in love with the song ""Movies."" So, excuse my rating cause I'm bias. :)P.S. I agree. Aaliyah was the true R&B princess. She just wasn't overly promoted as Ashanti."
4,Ur Foolish If U Don't By This!!,"This Is Probably One Of The Best CD's I own!~Intro- really cool~Foolish- 1st single, good song~Happy- my 2nd favorite song!, really cool beat~Leaving (Always On Time Part II)- my FAVORITE song!!- nice rythym~Narrative Call (Skit)-ok~Call- neat song!~Scared- nice song- good beat and lyrics~Rescue- lovely song! goes on forever tho! (over 7mins)!!~Baby- nice beat cool song~VooDoo- cool song- nice beat~Movies- awesome!~Fight (over skit)- nice~Over- sad song~Unfoolish- the best song in the whole world (besided whats love!), nice tone- a lot like foolish w/ a twist!~Shi Shi (skit)- funny!!~Dreams- good message and song!~Thank You- i didn't know how someone could thank so many people so beautifly!"
3,Average- Big Let Down,"Songs are nothing like Foolish. Pretty boring cd. About 5 good songs. She has the voice definitely but needed better songs to sing. I loved both foolishes, Dreams, Thank You. She's pretty cute though. Not bad. Just average."
1,Waste of money and time,"I purchased this a few months ago. Within using it about 3-4 times, all 3 warming trays got holes which made the product useless. I contacted the manufacture and it took weeks and weeks of emails and voicemails before someone finally replied to my complaints of a defective product and sent me 3 replacement warming trays. All 3 replacement trays now have holes after 3 uses. Dont buy this product unless you want to only use it a few times and then wait weeks and weeks to get new trays. Waste of money. They should recall the item and offer full refunds."
4,BCS997,"The Helman Group BCS-997 Stainless-Steel 3-Station Buffet Server with Separate Heat Controls and Glass LidsMy Buffet station BCS997 also came with a loose part and a handle that was not attached properly. I purchased the $64 option and was not surprised that this station was, in all likelihood, a ""second"".After having the station repaired I was pleased that the individual heating controls work so well. I'm wondering if the problems the other buyers had were because of the low price option."
2,You get what you pay for,"I was very excited to get this buffet for Thanksgiving, but when I opened it up I was immediately disappointed when I saw that the middle heat control's was not poking out of the hole so that I could attach the knob. It was stuck behind the metal and I have not been able to pry it out.I have not been able to utilize the middle station.I guess I will just splurge a little next time and get a well made buffet that will last me for years."
1,Read the reviews first.,"I bought two units. One seems to be fine. However, the second unit had a broken handle, a broken temperature knob, and a burned out light. The one thing common be between the two units, paper thin aluminum containers. I sent one unit back, but I should have sent them both back."
2,Another desperate effort to prevent christian converts,"Western literature is littered with emotionally charged denunciation of Muslims in general and Islam and its Prophet in specific. There is no comparable broadbased movement against Chritianity amongst the Muslims. The Muslims are constrained by their belief system not to be disrespectful of Jesus, while the Christians and their Clergy seem to take great pleasure in trying to outdo each other in the amount of venom they can spew out against Muhammed(PBUH) and Islam. The subconciuos hatred of the Muslims seems to be a Thread that links all Christians, the religious as well as the secular. The battle for converts is surely to be won by the Muslims."
1,why the hate crusade?,"I understand that it's difficult for the Christian community to face the fact that hundreds of thousands of them convert to Islam... but please understand that there is a reason for it. Anyone who researches Islam and learns about the true religion will see the light. This is what such book hope to deter... they hope to keep christians from learning about Islam and to encourage hate. Muslims and Christians are both people of the book, both children of Abraham, both believers in One God. Why do Muslims face such a crusade of hate from Christians as appears in this book?"
2,"Pretty voice, not much else","Inessa Galante has a lovely voice. Unfortunately, her delivery leaves much to be desired. In other words, while most of these songs are nice, and Galante sounds okay singing them, you can find always find better versions. Particularly the Jewel Song, Caro nome, and Sempre libera are entirely unsuited to Galante's heavy voice."
4,Endorsed by my son,"I purchased this book and left it on the kitchen table. My son, who is still working on learning to read, came home and noticed the book and opened it up. I watched him out of the corner of my eye, to see what he would do. After reading the first page, he sat down and started reading. I watched him off and on as he intently sat and read the book all the way through. I saw him smile to himself a few times. Eventually he finished the whole book and got up with a sense of self-satisfaction (finishing a book provides a sense of satisfaction no matter your age). I asked him if he liked it, and he said he did and we talked about it for a while. He's read it a few times since then.So, for a young reader to pick up a book and read it all the way through on his own...and come back to it again, can there be a better endorsement of a book?"
3,Mr. Gum Man,"My husband has the title of Mr. Gum Man with the kids in the neighborhood and the grandkids. Recently, we needed to replace his Double Bubble bubble gum machine. This one was not nearly as nice. The globe quality was much lighter weight. The mechanics were about the same, but all in all, I wasn't as impressed with the replacement, as I was with the original."
5,Popularity At Last!,"Now I'm the most popular desk in the office! Wish more people would come talk to you? Get a gumball machine! It's better if you actually want people to come see you, otherwise you'll be irritated to no end. Great for a fun thing to put in the kitchen too! This listing is actually for the refills. I found these ones delicious and would recommend them. It's not bubblegum so don't expect to get huge bubbles but I was able to blow some bubbles with this."
1,Extremely cheaply made and highly over priced!,This item did not last long. Cheaply made and over priced. It wasa Christmas present and broke within days.
1,NO ES ORIGINAL!!!,"Como ustedes sabran, salieron muchos grupos que decian ser los Pasteles Verdes. Este CD tiene muchas de las canciones que fueron exitos de la agrupacion, pero desgraciadamente son unos copiones. NO SON LOS ORIGINALES PASTELES VERDES. No se escuchan nada como ellos, ni la voz, ni la musica. Si a ti te gustan las canciones romanticas de esa gran agrupacion no te recomiendo que compres este CD . . . la verdad te vas a arrepentir. El Vendedor fue bueno, me llego el producto en el tiempo indicado y supongo que no es culpa de el/ella que el CD no sea bueno, pero esos $10 que pague fueron un desperdicio . . . el CD ya esta en la basura."
4,As the title states... it isn't for Yankee Fans!!!,I wonder how many more reviews will appear here from Yankee fans condemning this book. It may not be the best book in the world but Yankee fans take their team a little too seriously. You all need to develop a sense of humor when it come to you precious Bronx Bombers.
1,Not Worth The Paper Its Printed On,"When I first received this book for review I was looking for something clever and witty that would have some comedic value. Well I couldn't say anything good about it. It is a boring attempt by a jealous fans to put down the Yankees in a way that is used by the kids in the playground. It is as immature as chanting Yankees Suck at a ballgame.If you like Beavis and Butthead this may be the book for you. No matter what fan you are wait, it will end up on the used list dirt cheap. It is not worth the paper it is printed on."
4,"Easily put together, did need a little glue though","Gave this for a 10th birthday gift, the kids first model of this kind, I didn't want him to do a full glue together kit first off. It all snapped together really easily and didn't need any assistace from an adult other thatn the nose cone and exhaust needet to be glued in place as they wouldn't stay put. All in all a great starter kit."
5,"20"" Widescreen Protection","I'm a college student and always on the move. The geargrip harness is definitely an investment that puts my mind at ease. This is definitely stronger and more secure than my old method of wrapping the screen in towels! Plus, the handle is convenient for lugging around."
5,"Perfect for my needs, only one concern","This works great for sales presentations out in the field. I carry a 24.5"" monitor in this case. No longer have to rely on a bulky projector or have to ask for a conference room to do the sales presentations. Also great for trade shows. Only drawback is that you must be sure to have the straps buckled up VERY tight as it screen will slide out the side if loose. The other tip I have is (in order to save setup time later) to go ahead and connect the power cord and the VGA cord in the monitor and bundle them up in the handy pockets on the back of the case."
1,No visible light on any surface or lighting condition.,"I received this item this afternoon, and filled it with four brand new Duracell Copper top Alkaline AA batteries, and then switched it on. I couldn't discern any light at all. So I went into a fully dark closet, shut the door and tried again.The bulb emitted a dull glow, but didn't produce any light that could be seen further away than about 1/2"" of an inch from the bulb. Thinking that it might have to ""warm"" up, because it has a fluorescent tube, I left it turned on for around 6-7 minutes, and still no visible light was emitted. The glow that you see in the picture image is just about it, with no light produced at all.I've returned it to Amazon for a refund."
3,Thank you!!,"Even though this product ended up being not what we needed, it was received quickly. Thank you for the great turn-a-round!!"
2,Look Elsewhere,"The only advantages to this phone is that it is cute and quad-band. It cuts out all the time, even when you have full service. It cuts out for no reason. Ive had this phone for 6 months and as each month goes by the ear speaker is getting worse and worse. I can hardly hear anything now. I am forced to use an earpiece or the speaker. I love motorola phones but the v551 is sadly a disappointment. definitely look elsewhere!"
1,Ear piece goes bad,The ear piece on this phone goes bad. I had a V400 and the ear piece went bad. They replaced it 4 times then cingular gave me the V551 and i had to get that replace once and then the warranty ended and the ear piece failed again. I absolutely do not recommend this phone or other motorola's.
1,HEL* in phone form,"This phone is a p.o.s. It crashes randomly leaving you with a white screen and a static sound that will deafen you if youre having a conversation. the camera phone quality is horrid the video isnt great either ive had one of these for about a year now and i have had nothing but trouble since day one ive had 3 replacement phones so i know it wasnt just a faulty one and just today my v551 has apparently lost all power to the screen so open or closed i cant see anything so no txt messages no phonebook no games no pictures no nothing if you have this phone already i feel your pain, if you havent gotten it and are considering it STOP IT!"
1,Don't buy it,"I've had this phone for more than a year now and finally broke down and replaced it. I am writing from my own experiences and that of my friends who also own it. On average, I was able to get less than 24 hours standy-by time (that's right, without talking at all). The bluetooth is flaky and cuts out often. The charger connection is fairly delicate and sometimes falls out. Really, the only redeeming value of the phone is it's terrific display. I got the phone for $50 and still felt that I got ripped off by this phone. Just don't buy it."
1,Worst phone ever,"Has a short battery life. If not being used, two days, otherwise shorter.The menu navigation is difficult and non-intuitive.The phone camera picture quality is poor and you need additional network services to move pictures off the phone. More money.The phone has buttons on the outside that can change the ring style. So while it sits in your pocket it can change to silent mode or vise versa. Very annoying.By the time I realized how poor this phone was I was well over my 30 day trial. Now I'm stuck with this lemon for two years. :("
1,Disappointing on all fronts,"Battery life is limited, one day maximum (and that's without the camera use or any other non-phone item.) Talk time will cut into that as well, so forget about the projected 7 hours/7 days talking/standby time. Motorola has already replaced the battery to no avail. Next route is a distance Motorola service center. One of the helpful sales persons told me that there had been problems with this phone, along these lines, but you can probably do better with an entirely different phone. I appreciated the generally helpful service lines, but if the phone doesn't work right in the first place, what's the use? Seriously consider another phone from Motorola and/or an entirely different brand unless you are a glutton for punishment."
2,Marriage counselor wanted,"Others covered most of my pros and cons.Big Problem. The phone can't be used while charging. It's a big deal, because charges are frequent and looooooooonnnnnnnggggggggg. Lots of downtime with this phone.Pro. I get long periods of quiet-time when the phone isn't working.Second Problem. Browsing and text messaging will happen frequently and accidentally unless you are very, very careful.Pro. I am no longer internet illiterate, and have really enjoyed the strange people I've been text messaging.Third Problem. I bought this phone for my wife, too, and she won't let me forget it.Pro. She can't call me to complain about it.p.s. If someone can figure out how to use this phone while it's charging.. I'll post a correction to this review, and, maybe my wife will start talking to me again."
1,Dropped calls and poor volume,"Like most new cell phones, this one has hundreds of features, all of which are useless if you can't talk with someone. I don't care about games, screens, ring tones or whatever, I just want a cell phone where I can reliably communicate with someone... this phone isn't it. And after reading the other reviews, I'm glad I'm not alone. Granted, for the first several months, I'm sure I was satisfied. But the low volume and continual dropped calls have made this impractical to live with. Lesson learned- make sure you read the reviews from people who have lived with this phone for at least half a year. And I see on the Cingular webpage that other customers have the same complainnts for the V551. I'm surprised Motorola or Cingular hasn't acknowledged this."
4,Good reliable phone,"I've had this phone for about 3 months now and have not had any problems such as dropped calls or any operational prolbems. The only thing I have had any problem with is understanding the manual. There is not enough detail about how to make certain things work, but eventually I was able to figure out everything that I wanted to do. Over all I think it's a great phone and I really like the speaker phone part especially when listening to messages and being able to write down numbers without having to hold the phone on my shoulder."
4,"Phone is fine, rebate offer is not.","The phone has performed well. No dropped calls, good reception and sound quality. I'm charging it every other day.As of now, March 2005, you will not get the rebate if you are porting your existing phone number to Cingular. Amazon seems to be unable to say that while you are ordering the phone with a Cingular plan but they will make it perfectly clear when the phone is delivered. If you can't get the rebate you may be able to get a better deal at the mall and have the phone working that day. See if you can port your number and get the rebate at: www.amazon.com/keep-your-number."
3,Motorola V551,This is not a bad phone overall. I tried 3 other phones before settling on this one. If the contacts are not working then try another cord. I had the same problem and got a new cord and have n problem now. Once fully charged I can go all day without needing a charge. It is a little hard to hear on the handset but the earpiece is of excellent volume. The phone is not hard to operate. The battery is like other slim phones you just have to have patience to assemble it. You can customize the wallpaper and screensaver of your choice. You can rearrange icons also of the order you like. I am satisfied with this phone but arent we all always looking for something better?
2,Not this one either...,"As indicated in a review for the V600, I received the V551 as a replacement for the V600, after that phone had already been replaced several times.Initially, I liked the V551 better, even though it is a less expensive phone. It seemed much less ""buggy"" than the V600. However, I have had more dropped calls, and more failed calls (which I initiate), and worse reception than with any phone I've ever owned.And just like on the V600, the stupid mechanism on the left side of the phone changes the ringer capriciously. Expecting a call? Don't hold your breath. The ringer is now on ""silent""."
1,AVOID THIS PHONE!!!!!,"I have a family plan with these phones, I have had to send SIX of these phones back for repair now.If you're doing the math, then you will realize I have had to send back the replacement phones.Every failure was the same, the speaker eventually starts to go out. At first it it's random, and eventually it completely dies.Motorola should get sued over this lemon of a phone."
4,Simply superb,I like Motoroals V551 is bcoz of it has got speaker phone and it speaker can be on while dialing it self. Which has got very screen resolution.
4,Richards review,"Great phone easy to use,have this phone about 3 months now.Had the v400 nice phone,but the v551 better phone great camara,video phone.Bluetooth awesome.Highly reconmend this phone V551 for the money.RPotter"
1,Cingular lowering the bar...and Motorola is not good,"I have had Cingular for two years and found the service to be very unreliable. I have had tons of missed calls, people try to call and it goes directly to voicemail even though my phone is on, and I won't get voicemails for hours after people call.Also Motorola makes the worst phones. The V551 is better than the last Motorola phone I had (V120 I think). I went throught four in a year and I did nothing to the phones except try to use it.Overall I can't wait for my contract to be over and don't bet a Motorola phone."
1,Poor battery life w/ Bluetooth!,Battery life was okay until the phone was about 4 month old. Had to get a new one and see the same issue. Note that running this phone w/ a Bluetooth headset (also by Motorola) may drain the battery in the course of a single day! Recommend - Don't buy!
3,"Feature Rich, But Troublesome","I won the phone so I'm not as critical as I would be if I had paid for it.With that said, be aware that the first software release had a problem that caused the screen to lock up--it would be white. The quick fix was to close and reopen the flip. The better fix is to return the phone for a new one or to have the phone flashed with the newer software.I've also noticed that I drop more calls when using the V551 versus a Blackberry 7280.Motorola should have done a bit more laboratory testing before releasing the phone."
2,"bad phone, bad service","I switched to Cingular from Sprint because of the increased national coverage. I don't like the phone and I don't like the service! The phone first; I can't see the screen outdoors! Non intuitive menus. Sometimes it charges; sometimes it doesn't! I too, have also hit the Cingular button and been connected to the internet..and billed for it! You can only press the number buttons so fast. Try punching in a number with the speaker on! A few more onboard ringtones would have been nice too. As for the service; The phone doesn't work in my apartment. I live 10 mins from downtown Philadelphia. It doesn't work in my girlfriend's apartment in Cranford NJ. Tons of dropped calls. Very unreliable service. And why do they make it so hard to get a rebate?? My advice is to try somebody else."
1,Paperweight...,"Bought this phone earlier this year and I really regret it.I bought a Motorola v551 phone and realized that it doesn't hold charge beyond a day and I talk at most 1 hour a day. I then realized that more than half the time I charge, the phone doesn't charge at all! Infact the phone displays a message ""Unable to Charge"". I realized I can only use my phone 3 or 4 days out of the week when I'm lucky enough to get it to charge. Frustrated with this poor performance I replaced the brand new battery with yet another brand new battery. No luck. I called support and had the phone replaced but same problem still persists. I read through several message boards and noticed many other people frustrated with the same problem.To make matters worse, this phone locks all ringtones and games you purchased for the phone. You can NOT take it out of your phone using bluetooth so if you need to replace your phone be prepared to repurchase all the games and ringtones!!"
1,NO battery life. This phone is terrible!! DONT BUY IT!,"I bought this phone two weeks ago and the battery life listed in standby mode says ""170 to 240 hours"". Thats directly from motorola in their documentation. The truth is this phone lasts about 4 to 5 hours, EVEN IN STANDBY before the battery is dead. Use it at all and it will last you about 2 hours. Use bluetooth in the car? It will last about 30 minutes.Check google with a search for ""v551 battery problem"" and witness the truth. This phone is trash and nobody should make the error of purchasing one and wasting your money like I did. Motorola has no plan to fix this problem, so dont buy this phone."
2,A BAD dEAL,"I bought a MOTOROLA V551 one year back. It is very difficult to charge this phone. If you insert the plug of charging cable, it keeps saying unable to charge . You have to give it side pushes and try all stupid gimmicks before it starts to charge. There have been days when it took me20 MINUTESto start the charging of this phone. The colors blue and silver are not flattering either. Why does nt motorola give some good colors, may be just metallic ones will do.I NEVER got the rebate on this phone . Either cingular or amazon is to be blamed.Overall this phone will get 2 stars from me."
2,me hate this phone,terrible respnse time the battery life is less then 5 hours topsflimsy as hek and terrible reciption. My dads girlfreind had this phone and she had it 4 about 7 weeks and then she closed it from talking and then it just shut down and never worked again.dont get it worst phone you will ever getbut it does have a good color screen but the front of the phone is week and flimsy and scratches really easliy and plus if your a kid and you go to school and you have the phone on you best have it off because like most phones it makes an annoying beebing sound when you have a new voice mail or missed call and it doesnt have silent mode so when you are in school or in a meeting you have to have it off if you dont want it to make any noise.by kevin nolan
2,Poor reception,"GThat's about it poor reception. Phone feature are good, pictures are poor quality and so is reception"
1,"Bad battery life, period.","I would rate this phone with 5 stars if it weren't for the wretched battery life. I'm getting only 24-36 hours on a recharge. (And yes, I've turned off Bluetooth; and yes, put it through several recharges; and no, I'm not using a rapid recharger). Cingular graciously replaced the battery, but the replacement seems to be doing even worse. The worst problem is that the battery meter goes from two bars to none in a matter of minutes. This is in stark contrast to my older Motorola v60, which seemed to go forever. I would avoid this phone."
2,Would be 5 stars if not for the battery,"The phone is packed full of great features, however, the battery life is horrendous. A full charge only lasts about 1 day with moderate use. It also seems to take a long time to charge; about 2+ hours from dead to charge complete."
3,Does anyone know how to reset the alarm clock feature?,"I just purchased this phone recently and for the amount of features and options that come with phone the manual is pretty much useless. They might as well not even give you one. There are certain features that I have no clue what they do, whether or not it would be better for me to change them of turn them off etc. Battery definetily could last longer. Does anybody know how to clear out the alarm clock so I can start entering new times. After you enter 5 times you can't enter anymore and I am not sure how to erase them so I can start entering new times again."
4,Good but not great,"I've had this phone for a couple of months now and I am quite satisfied with it so far. the picture/camera quality is far better than my old SE T610 and I love the real mp3 tones that it supports. I make my own little mp3 ring tones on my computer and transfer it to the phone via bluetooth.... that is really cool. Reception is ok, i suppose but definitely better than my old phone. Battery life is average. Also love the speaker phone but the speaker is located on the back of the phone, which does not make much sense. Overall, it's not a bad phone."
2,Poor quality phone,"I'm an old AT&T customer. I was going overseas and wanted a Quad phone, so I paid $249.99 for this at the Cingular store, plus $25 to unlock it so I didn't have to upgrade my phone plan from the existing converted AT&T to a new Cingular plan. I am returning it tomorrow. The sound quality is poor, the menus are confusing, and I get no reception at my house or in any of the small towns nearby. The only places I can make or receive calls are the major highways. I'm keeping my Sony Errickson T616, even though it doesn't work in Asia/India/Africa. The quality is far superior."
1,Horrible...Don't Waste Your $$$$,"I own a v551, my wife owns a v551, 2 co-workers of mine own v551's.....I think I have enough experience with the v551 to know that its a piece of junk. Everyone I know, myself included, who owns one of these sorry phones has problems with it. Problems include repeated dropped calls, the phone turing off for no reason, dropping the blue tooth connection by itself, the screen going white for no reason, poor reception, lousy battery life, pathetic ring tone selection, terrible sound. I could go on if I had the time. In short, please take my advice and look elsewhere. I have had such a terrible experience with this phone, that I have vowed to never buy from Motorolla again."
3,"Nice phone, but BIG cons","I will say that this phone has been through a lot of minor drops over its year and 4 months, seemingly unscathed. I like the display and the overall form of the phone. However, there are two HUGE cons which are forcing me to shop for another one:1. The volume is terrible - as of the past few weeks the volume has dropped and I can barely hear anyone, even though the volume meter reads ""7"". This really is awful.2. As with almost everyone else in these comments, I have had major issues with the charger. The interface is needlessly complex with way too many pins to align - it has taken 10 minutes to get the thing to connect right."
1,No volume...also,What a downer. I bought the V551 phone because I wanted to support Motorola. I paid $150 through Cingular. I can't hear anyone anymore - the volume is just not there! What good is everything else about the phone if it doesn't work with it's main purpose. I'm going through the process of getting a replacement through Cingular. We'll see how it goes.
2,phone not reliable,"I have used nokia phones for years and assumed that since their contact/address layout was similar to MS Outlook, all cell phones would likewise be similar...how wrong I was. If you intend to use this phone to manage business and personal contacts, get a Palm or Nokia. Also, the speaker is known to burn out on these phones. Motorola knows this and continues to sell a sub-par product. I can only use my phone with a bluetooth wireless. The speaker has been replaced 3 times!!!! Thanks a lot Cingular and Motorola, what a team."
2,"No Voice Dialing without additional ""voice connect"" service.","Overall this phone works very well. I am very pleased with the voice quality, signal strength, display, keypad and battery life. When used with Cingular, it does not support voice dialing unless you subscribe to the $4.99 Cincular ""voice connect"" service.The phone is capable of voice dialing but it appears that Cingular has asked Motorola to disable the ability to enter Voice Names in the phone's address book. To get around this I use a Motorola V60 to add new phone book entries with a voice name. This requires swapping the phone' SIM card between the V60 and V551 every time a new entry is added.This phone would receive a 5 star rating instead of a 2 star rating if it did not disable entering voice dialing names."
2,Lousy phone,"I had this phone for a year. During that time it continuously dropped my calls and told others my number was not working. Sometimes when I placed a call it said the number I called wasn't a working number, even when I was just on the phone with the person at that number and got dropped. Then my screen failed, all the color drained out of it (fade to black). I tried to use it anyhow but it wouldn't allow me to place calls. Next it stopped accepting calls, and finally it won't even turn on. So, now I am without a phone."
2,Unreliable,"This phone seems to get fairly poor reception and drops my calls to the point of uselessness. The bluetooth connectivity is unreliable and, more than half the time, requires a reset before it can be used with another device. The user interface is not as usable and responsive (there is a slight delay in every button press)."
2,"Eh, could have been worse.","If it had caught on fire when it rang.Not so great.It tends to lose connection if I put pressure on the screen area, or cause massive static.Seemed cool looking when I got it, but it's pretty awkward, actually. Even with ""maximum bars"", it'd often drop, it had a very hard time connecting with online capacity even after several attempts at official maintenance. Sound would crackle oddly, and the hinge often felt on the verge of overextension."
1,A little something from everybody,"My experience has mirrored that of the majority of V551 users. In general, satisfaction for a couple of months, then frustration, finally downright disgust. Camera functions are okay ( good for screensavers & wallpaper), my battery life is good, (my wife's is bad), etc. The worst experiences are dropped calls and many episodes of volume so low I have to activate the speakerphone (irritating in public). My wife's small company purchased a Cingular plan and offered these phones to employees on the same plan, with about 6 or 7 takers. All but one have experienced similar frustrations. I get amused when I read a review stating that that person has had wonderful experiences with the V551 and has ""...no idea why some have rated this phone subpar"" because it has worked well for him. The reason for reading several reviews is to get a general idea of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a product. No one product is going to give everyone ALL bad or ALL good experience."
1,Don't get this phone,"It hurts to say I was wrong but in this case I'll bite the bullet and admit. I made the wrong choice.I usually don't post comments but I was mucho motivated to save everyone else the same grief I and my friends went through. You're probably reading this page because you think this is a great phone but trust me this phone is aweful.Battery life lasts 1 day max, talk time is 2 hours max, and the phone won't charge properly. Heck, the guy at the Cingular corporate store even admits they've been hearing lots of complaints about this phone's battery life.I've bought new batteries, twice actually but that didn't solve the problem. The Cingular guy told me that the phone is at fault not the battery.. Well what can I say, I'm using an old Sony Ericsson T616 now.. I know its old but it's 10times better... My friend who was using v551 went back to using a black & white screen nokia phone and he's happier with it..I dare you to buy this phone.. Just don't say I didn't warn you..."
1,Sell your Motorola & Cingular stock,"First of all, sell your Motorola stock. No one who buys this phone will ever buy anything made by Motorola again. Your phone will break. I am on my third, and you can hear only on the speaker phone. I would return it for another refurbished one, but why bother? I would only be getting a refurbished unit that one of the other reviewers of this phone returned. And do not expect eager cooperation from Cingular in dealing with this problem unit. So sell your Cingular stock, too. As soon as my contract is up, I am: leaving Cingular for good; getting an unlocked phone model from a different manufacturer; and buying time on T-Mobile as I need it. You have been warned. Caveat emptor."
1,I've gone through 4 so far- you tell me.,"This phone is solid when it works. WHEN IT WORKS. I'm on my 4th, only because im putting up with this madness until my contract runs out. I have no problem with cingular's service but this phone is a nightmare. It just dies and cannot be restarted. Apparently this IS A COMMON PROBLEM. Why Motorola and cingular would continue to to put a defective product is beyond me. I will not buy another motorola phone and if cingular doesnt cut me a great deal when my contract is up I will no longer use their services either.Poor poor job on cingular and motorola's part.Stay away."
5,"solid phone, recommended","Purchased V551 a month ago after being a satisfied T721 owner. This phone takes everything good about T721 and makes it better.1) brighter display2) Bluetooth functionality (use this frequently with HS820)3) Speakerphone4) CameraThe minor negatives are:1) Reduced battery life with Bluetooth active2) Cingular software: wish i could remove shopping applications, AIM, and other cluttering software installed on phone."
1,Horrible.,"Awful, wretched, miserable P.O.S. Do NOT buy this phone (Motorola V551). Nothing but trouble with the power supply, battery, battery life, charging time, lack of ability to recieve or make calls while charging, missed calls, etc. Today the battery charger died - now I can't charge this chunk of crap at all and Cingular will not make warranty replacements at ANY of the so-called 'Cingular' stores in my area (Manhattan). I either have to wait for those clowns to send me a new charger or go buy a new one at MY expense after owning this hateful object for less than 70 days. I hate this phone and I hate Cingular."
2,NOT a BAD Phone,This is phone has aboslutely crushed all my expectations..Bad ReceptionLow Battery Life.. If you miss to charge it at night.. you are gone for the next dayBacklight doesn't stay more than 10-15 seconds...Need to particularly assign ringtones for all the numbers in the phone book else you won't get the ring.. the default is NONE.The side button changes the.. Ringer profiles.. from loud to silent... and it happens all the times ..Now coming to pros..Really Good Camera..Captures good videos too..Bluetooth...(never used it though)I'm getting a Nokia 3120.. can't afford to buy another phone..Finally.. Get this phone.. only.. if you boast of having very good reception.. and you don't miss to charge every night..Hope this helps..
1,I hate this phone,"I have had many motorola and nokia phones, and this one is BY FAR the worst. NO reception...simple as that. I can not use the phone at my own home ever. I am changing /upgrading today. I have had it for 6 months, and kept calling cingular and hoping for the best, for nothing. They said it's because I have 'trees' by my house. Ok, so don't buy this is you live near trees (?) !!"
1,"Awful, awful phone","Motorola should have been pulled up on some sort of Trades Description Act because the battery life on this phone is absolutely dreadful.As many have already noted, if you forget to charge this phone each night, the battery is dead the next morning after a couple of hours.I can't wait for my wireless contract renewal to come up so I can get back to a Nokia."
2,pretty but useless,This is the third motorola that I've owned and it sucks. It takes 8 hours to charge and the charge only holds 10-12 hours. I got a new battery but no improvement. Also it only holds a call for 3-4 minutes then drops it no matter where you are or where you're calling.The camera is nice and it is a pretty phone to look at.Get a different model.
2,have some annoying issues,"The nice thing about it is that it plays MP3s so you don't have to pay for ringtones.It has the following issues though:1) very poor battery life, one day and it's gone, and for some reason it takes so long to charge!!2)The ear bud has a very annoying noise that gets worse if the earbud wire comes closer to the antenna. Don't understand why Mot will put the ear bud plug right next to the antenna3) Drops calls like crazy, and it starts by you not hearing the other side while they do hear you, and then the call ends.4)The voice command feature is of no use:a)First, it allocates very short time duration for the command.b)if you have multiple numbers for each person, you have to record each one with a unique voice command. My T610 used to record the name of the person, and then it lets you record if it is a cell or office, etc..c) not matter how I record the name using my bluetooth headset, or any other method, it just seems to be having hard time recognizing the speech."
2,cuts out all the time,"My husband and I each bought these phones not to long after they came out. I had always heard good things about Motorola, but I really don't recommend this phone. I wish I would have saved the $100 a piece I paid for them.I like some things about the phone... the camera is alright, it has a lot of features, and it is pretty easy to use.My major problem is that both phones CONSTANTLY cut out and hang up on people. Plus, you never know how long you have been talking to yourself.The phones have speaker phone, which is a really good thing because that is usually what I have to use just to be able to hear the person I'm talking to.It is the worst when I am talking to my husband on his phone, I guess since they are the same phone.I really do not recommend this phone. I really don't think it is worth it, even if you can get it for free now."
2,broken,"After 8 months of ownership, suddenly the reception went south. No reception in or near my house, or inside anywhere. Reception could be good outside (out of town.) The connection to the charger is finicky, so sometimes it isn't charging when you think it is.I got the run-a-round from cingular trying to get a replacement. After two long phone conversations. I was told to go to the local dealer. The dealer gave me another phone number to call. The operator at that number told me that the dealer should have at least swapped out the SIM card to see if it was the problem. Anyhow, eventually I got a new phone amd so far it works.I always connect my phone to the charger when driving (9 hrs per week) so my phone is always charged. I won't complain about the need for frequent charging; it's better than my digitial camera battery!"
1,"A Mediocre Phone, Perfect For People Looking To Frustrate Themselves!!!!!!","I rate this phone a 1 only because the bar cannot be lowered any more.This phone is unreliable at best. Some of the features include:-Low volume levels that get worse with age-Terrible reception! Go from full signal strength to none without even moving-Drop calls like mad especially with Cingular's ServiceSo, if you are a person who generally likes to frustrate themselves, purchase this phone. I know about 4 other people who have the same phone and the same problems. Beware!!!!!!!!!"
1,Can I give the V551 no stars?,"I don't know if it's Cingular (we call it ""Stinkular"" as an ongoing joke) or the phone, but we are experiencing all of the same things that are being said here.-At least 5 dropped calls per day. I'm tired of saying ""Hello? You there?"" only to look at the phone and realize I've been talking to myself for the last minute.-The charging on this phone is plagued by poor design. The plug can be easily moved in such a way as to not charge the phone when you think it's being charged.-Sound is the worst. You can barely hear anyone with the volume turned all the way up.-Reception is also the worst. Don't know if it's cingular or the phone, but from what I hear here, must be both.-Phone is packed with features, but it is the slowest phone I have ever used. There is such a delay when dialing, accessing menus, everything.-Freezes up like it was made to do so. Have had the phone exchanged and it still doing the same thing.-Have had to pull the battery to get it to unfreeze"
2,"except basic phone functions, others are ok","Pros:1. good camera2. nice color display3. better contact list than older models like V66, but still not idealCons:1. bad reception -- worse than my V662. drop calls very often -- a service guy told me I have to reboot it once a while!3. the key tone is slower than the speed you type.4. bulky"
1,"This phone is cool, but it really does suck...","Pros: Nice screen, real sound ringtones, video & camera, games, etc.Cons: Charging problems, headset died four months into use and forced me to use bluetooth. Battery began steep decline in power about two months into use.Luckily I won a Nokia QD in a contest and have been able to use it, otherwise I'd have be more angry as I would have had to shell out the big bucks for a new phone by now."
2,Yep. Some models do eat batteries.,"I purchased a brand new V551, wishing to take advantage of its EDGE internet capabilities. However, right out of the box it sucked the life right out of both the included battery and the one that I used on my V400. In fact, it looks as if both batteries are now unusable. There is no doubt that some of these units are defective."
2,4th Try is not the charm,"This is the 4th phone from Cingular. The first 3 V600's were dropping calls every 18-21 minutes. Defect in the phones. They were nice to replace it with a V551. It too is dropping calls. The non-ability to use voice dial is a crime. The videos aren't worth anything..just a novelty. When the phone hangs on to calls, the voice quality is good, the features are fine, and the bluetooth is priceless. While the dropped calls may be a motorola thing, I've never experienced so many dropped calls (in a major metro area) on the other carriers I've had. They have good customer service. My suggestion is to get a Sony-Ericsson or to use another carrier altogether."
4,World Phone,"V551 is a great phone to have with its bright color screen, easy navigation, speakerphone, and sleek design. The phone is a Quad band GSM phone which means you can use it on any GSM network in the world, pretty useful if you are a globe trotter. It has an integrated camera with zoom and exposure control.You can send pictures you took and music in your messages with its MMS capabilities. With 5 MB memory, there is a lot of stuff you can store on this cellphone. Navigation is easy and additional options are available in most screens with the 'menu button' which has a context-sensitive menu. The phone has bluetooth, so when you are driving, you can take calls with a bluetooth handsfree, even if you cannot reach the phone within the car! Speakerphone is very clear!"
5,Excellent Phone,"The best phone I've owned by far. I've owned many of the recent top of the line stuff from Panasonic, NEC, Nokia and Motorola. I'm a phone nut and this phone is the best of them all. I'm not into the cameras, etc. What I like is the extremely solid feel, outstanding reception and clarity of my calls, especially when compared to other high priced phones that Cingular offers. Also, the speakerphone is surprisingly clear and useable and the display is beautiful, with easy to navigate menus. An excellent phone all around. My only negative? No USB port. The phone has bluetooth, but how many of us have bluetooth on our pcs?"
1,Tons of problems,"This phone came highly recommended by tons of people. So I bought it this past summer in June. Well, a couple months after having it, I have noticed a bunch of problems:1) I can't hear anything on the phone, even with full volume. Most of the time I have to change to speaker phone to hear anything.2) Charging is a NIGHTMARE!!! I have to plug it in, move the charger around for about 10 minutes, and then place in very softly on the table. It's like I'm trying to find a signal.3) I have had very long delays (5-10 seconds) of the phone registering that I hit a button. Sometimes I can dial an entire 10 digit number before it recognizes the first.4) When I have a strong signal, it won't place calls for no reason. Sometimes it will read signal busy, but most of the time it just returns with ""Call Failed"".I don't recommend this phone to anyone."
4,good phone,"I've had this phone for months now. It seems to work good for me. I sometimes get dropped calls, I don't know if its cingular or the phone. It takes excellent pictures. All the features it describes works perfectly. I like it better than most other phones I've seen ppl using. You can't beat the deal on amazon anywhere."
1,Don't get this phone!,"I was with T-Mobile for about 6 years, had an ancient Nokia 5100, and figured it was time to upgrade my phone, so both my boyfriend and I switched to Cingular and got Motorola V551's. We both are signed up for two years with this crappy phone and service. Our phones drop calls all the time, we have to stand by a window in our home to get service, sometimes the phone just freezes up so I have to turn it off and wait two minutes while it ""loads"" back up. What if I needed to make an emergency call??? I've complained to Cingular many times already, and nothing. I long for my ancient Nokia 5100."
4,"Mechanically, it's a good phone -- but poor user interface.","My only gripe with this phone is that Motorola's user-interface just doesn't have an apparent logic to it, and as a result you have to dig out the user manual time and again.Also, if you use reading glasses, you will probably need them with this phone b/c there is no option to make the tiny letters in the display any larger, as is the option with some other phone brands."
3,MoTo V551,This phone is pretty neat....Keep in mind that the chrome outer layer DOES BREAK EASILY! and the blue outside screen is worthless bc u cant see self-portrait photos on it....it does NOT have a flash which plays a BIG part in what i buy....the good side is that it DOES capture video and it does look nice...better ringtones wouldve been nice though....its okay if ur not too picky about features
1,Worst Phone I Have Ever Had,"This is by far the worst phone that I have ever had. I have had three different copies of this phone (Not by my choice. Under Cingular's Warranty program, you can't even discuss getting a different model untill your third replacement). For my first verision, the phone stopped holding a charge. For my second copy, the only way I could hear people on the other end was through speakerphone. For my most recent version (which I had for only FIVE DAYS), the microphone did not work, so people on the other line could only hear static. Luckily, I am finally going to get a different model. Do not buy this phone under any circumstances. You will be aggrevated and dissapointed."
3,Good and bad,"If I could charge the phone, it would be fine. My biggest frustration, as with many other reviews that I've seen, is that the charger doesn't connect and so you have to wriggle it to make it recognize the connection.I drop this phone all the time and it's held up nicely. It's a bit bulky and I'm ready to get into a smaller phone, but voice quality is fine, and I don't have as many dropped calls as I've had with other Motorola and Nokia phones.A tip: Radio Shack sells car charger that's really cool and fits the phone perfectly. It has adaptable attachments on it that can fit any cell phone so when and if you get rid of your current cell phone, you only have to spend $10 to get a new tip for the charger instead of $30 or $40 for a whole new set-up."
4,Motorola V551,"The Motorola V551 is a prety dependable phone. It has really withstood a lot of damage. I have dropped it on numerous occasions on many different surfaces. I have even dropped it in the toilet and it still works. Overall, the only problem I really have with it is the battery life. It's probably about standard, but I was hoping for a little bit more when I purchased the phone. The features and design are great. The call quality is pretty good especially for the Northwest Arkansas landscape."
2,Speaker Goes Bad,This is the second phone I have had and the speaker in the ear goes bad. Volume will cut out in the middle of the conversation and I have to tap it on something to bring it back.
2,Not that good,"I thought this phone would be better then my LG, I had. I love that it has a camera and video, but that is really the only good things about it. My phones freezes, drops calls, changes the audio on it's own, and now, it won't hang up when it's closed so my battery dies if I don't turn it off, so I have to turn it off when I am not using it, which means I miss calls. I am definitely looking into another phone right now."
2,Worst Ever phone I owned,"I have owned this phone for one year. After six months calls started droping, bad signal catching and it goes on.I would never suggest this phone to any one."
2,Great phone if you don't mind dropped calls,"This phone is great. The speakerphone, camera, video recorder, etc. The big problem is the fact that it drops calls every 7 minutes or so. Sometimes more or less frequently. I just spoke to a customer service representative, and they said that it is a defect in the phone, and it needs to reconnect to the network every three days or so. This means I must turn my phone off for 10 minutes or so every 3 days. This is just a big pain and unless you want to deal with this problem, please do not buy this phone!"
4,Sleek little phone!,"After years of having a non-flip phone, I still wasn't sold on the idea of having to open the phone every time I needed to answer or place a call. This phone comes Blue-Tooth enabled, so I also purchased the Blue-Tooth headset and when that feature is in use, you don't have to flip the phone open to place/answer calls. The clarity is excellent, although I'm still not answering the phone quite correctly with the headset. A detail I'll get worked out. Didn't want a camera, but the phone came with it. The menus are easy to use and fairly intuitive and it's easy to personalize and program. I think I'm going to be very happy with this purchase."
1,Disapointed in Chicago,I was am very disapointed with this phone. I am in in the process of sending it back in exchange of the Nokia 6230. I knew that I should of stayed with Nokia but I wanted to try something different. The reception is terrible and week. I can only use this phone when I'm inside my house by the windows. When I'm in certain areas in my state there is a lot of static. I didn't have all of those problems with my Nokia 3560. I just can't deal with it anymore. I've had the phone for 2 weeks and I'm ready to send it back. If you want a phone with good reception don't buy Motorola. A lot of my friends had bad experiences with Motorola as well.The Cingular customer service is just as bad. They keep transferring me around. Nobody seems to know where to send me. Since I ordered online they say that I need to exchange it online. Well I can't find the option anywhere. So now I'm back on the phone.
1,What a piece of junk ...,"This is by far the worst cell phone I have ever owned. Stand-by time is less then 24 hours. Talk time is less then 1-hr. The claims Motorola makes in regards to this phones performance, are simply a flat out lie. Once the charge bar starts to fall, you better get to a charger. You will need a charger in your car, home and office. The performance is awful. I know of 3 other people that fell for the trap. We all HATE THIS PHONE. The reception sucks. Too many useless features. Granted, my Cingular wireless service is possibly the biggest piece of crap wireless service out there. Combined with this phone, I am ready to jump off a bridge. Calls are constantly dumped. The LCD screen cracked after 2 weeks. Stay away from this phone at all costs. Stick with a Nokia. I would love to have my old Nokia."
2,"disappointed, was it carrier or phone?","I thought the V551 was a pretty good phone, then had problems with reception that I was unable to resolve. I am not sure if it was Cingular or the phone, as they told me that I had burned out a SIM card (phone?) and that all the subsequent problems were due to the phone. I will give Motorola the benefit of the doubt, although I admit I exchanged it for a treo 650..."
1,Beware of LOUSY Cingular system,"I got this phone from Cingular one week ago, and it NEVER worked. I had to call them and waitting for more than 30 mins to talk to the representative AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN during mt thanksgiving holiday. They still CAN NOT fix the problem so far. Their excuse is the merge of Cingular and AT&T. I guess they already have enough customers now and do not need any more. I am going to return my phone and swith back to T-mobile. At least I can see the logo on my phone. KEEP AWAY from this LOUSY company!!!!!"
2,bad,wen i got dis fone i wuz impressed i tought i wusnt gonna like it but its very stylish no dought about dat overall the fone does have good reception n it has wonderful the bestes speaker..but den the fone iz xtremely fat its very heavey n wen it vibrates its very annoyin u hear the vibration more den the ring video records r like 10 seconds the keppads r 2 wide so i returned it for the samsung p207 which iz an awsome fone
3,Negative reviews ruined this for me,"Having read Ms. Owen's HeartMates series and enjoyed it deeply, I decided to check out her other work. I made the mistake of reading the negative reviews before reading this story, however. Many of the negative reviews are startlingly accurate, but I believe that I would have enjoyed the story a lot more if I hadn't read the criticism first. Many of the criticisms were things that I would not have noticed if I had approached the story in my usual non-critical suspension of disbelief.That said, this story is very enjoyable, but it does hold together more like young adult fiction than adult fiction, despite the sex scenes. This is definitely fiction fluff. If you're coming from the HeartMates series, I would recommend sticking with it; if you like this book, I would recommend graduating toHeart Mate (Celta's HeartMates, Book 1)."
4,Excellent moisturizer,I've been using this face cream for awhile now. It has a rich consistency without being greasy. My skin feels softer and it minimizes fine lines and wrinkles on my face.
4,Sticky feeling,"Getting older means getting wrinkles and no cream, or lotion will stop it but this actually helped. Though it leaves your skin feeling slightly sticky."
1,"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift, Anti-wrinkle",There were many positive comments about this product. I have been using it two times a day for several weeks and did not get the results that was expected.It did not work for me. I am going to try another product because it has a good rating.This is the first time that I gave a poor rating on any product. I buy a lot from Amazon and have been very happy with the products that I order.
1,I swear this GAVE me wrinkles,I had very few wrinkles around my eyes so I decided to try this to get rid of them. Within a few weeks I had a LOT of wrinkles around my eyes and especially under my eyes! I have no idea what in the world happened. My mother hardly has any wrinkles and my sister (who is 13 years older than me) doesn't either. I don't get what happened at all but I'm very upset about the results.
5,its a winner,i am over 60 with a few fine lines. i have used this for 3 weeks every day and i can honestly say i really see a difference. this jar will not last for more then 5 weeks but this price is fantastic and if it works who cares. i use elizabeth ardens cleanser also and it is fantastic. i would highly recommend that you buy this.
3,OK as moisturizer,OK as a moisturizer but doesn't do what it claims. Not worth the money I payed for it. To bad.
5,Seems to work...,Living at the beach year round my face sometimes takes a beating between the sun in the summer and the wind in the winter. This product seems to have eased the wrinkles. Been using it for about 2 weeks and I think I can see a difference...or at least it seems that way.
1,Burning after one use,"I tried this for the first time last night before bed. Within minutes of applying, my face started to feel very irritated and there was an awful burning sensation. I washed it off right away but this morning I had some peeling in my t-zone area. My face has never been sensitive but it is on the dry side so I thought this product would help. I realize everyone is different and this may work great for some but I definitely had a bad reaction to it."
3,Okay...,Feels like there are granules in it... I hope it is not old... Hope it works! Looking forward to using it!
5,Great Product!,"This product is wonderful. Great for middle age skin. Light and not greasy, absorbs quickly into your skin. L'Oreal products are not expensive and are good quality!"
3,well?,"Last time I used a L'Oreal was about 5 years ago - with younger skin so no complain, I guess. After that I have been pretty much with Kiehl's and RoC. Back to L'oreal this one, somehow I feel it comes with small particles. and a few times it peels off like srcub masks. Not sure if it's me - using wrong lotion underneath or... just the way this product is."
1,If you love animals please realize Loreal tests on animals,"According to ChaCha.com:""Loreal Paris ended all testing on finished products on animals in 1989, however new chemical ingredients must be tested on animals.""Nope- will not be buying any of their products..."
4,Reasonable overview.,"I was looking for something a little more in depth, but it is a good overview for upper extremities."
5,Love the Two together!,"I love the Baum series, and I was so thrilled to get the first two together in one book! It was well preserved in excellent condition, and is a good beginning to my collection; actually, it is a replacement to my almost-40 year old pocketbooks of the entire series that I have read and re-read and re-read, ad infinitum . . . Thanks for having it!"
3,OK,"The ring is just OK. Nothing amazing and nothing bad about it. If you are buying it for a toddler just know that the inner dimension of the circle is pretty large, I wish they made it a little smaller, so it would be safer for a small kid."
2,misleading product description,"The product description is misleading!I thought I was ordering three (3) swimming rings as shown in the image.However, only one (1) ring showed up. I did not have any choice of which ring I am getting. So you might end up with a design that you might now like. Product is ok, nothing fancy. The usual swimming ring."
5,float,I ordered this for my youngest daughter to use in the pool. She really loved the bright colors of the float. She has played pretty roughly with it as well and it has held up to her. Great purchase!
4,Swim Rings,My grandkids loved these and they are small enough for younger children to use in a pool and really enjoy them.
3,Average Cookbook,"Has some decent recipes but overall quite average. However, I'm a very picky eater so others might enjoy the book more."
2,More than one pot,Technically you don't just use one pot. The recipes are not that easy or common. This is not a book for beginners.
1,disappointed,"I went on line for ""slow cooker cookbook"" & this was listed under the heading - NOT TRUE. This is NOT as slow cooker cookerbook."
1,Not enough detail,"I returned this book as it did not give enough detail regarding time, nor did it give enough simple recipes. I am a new ""slow cooker"" & needed more help. There are much better books on the market."
4,good collection,"this is our first set of barbie movies, bought them for my 3-year old who is into everything princess. she loves the music and dances to it too. the only thing - ""the Diamond Castle"" movie made her cry at least 4 times, so i am going to put it away for now. the other two are fine."
2,oponion of CD Celtic Dreams,It was not as soothing as I thought it would be.I am a difficult sleeper and need soothing melodic music to put me to sleep and this CD did not exactly help me.
1,not good,"very bad , don't last break easy gets stuck in pen, cost to much.you just don't get your bang for the buck."
4,Decent product...,"As previously stated, the lead does break fairly easily. The product is a little overpriced be it that you are paying almost 5.00 USD for 12 pieces of lead. With that being said you are paying almost $0.42 for each piece of lead. Other than the price, I think this product is decent."
3,Cute Comedy Mystery Caper,"Farrah Fawcett's first big screen performance after leaving Charlies Angels was critically panned and flopped badly on its release in 1978. Much criticism was aimed at Farrah by a public who were not ready to see her in anything other than Charlies Angels. But to be fair this was more of a Jeff Bridges movie than a Farrah movie and on reflection its not as bad as people make out, its a cute, engaging little mystery and Bridges and Fawcett work well together. Nicely filmed in NYC with some moments of comedy thrown in amongst the mystery.Should be on DVD."
1,Don't waste your money,Bought this item with high hopes of using to safely solder copper fitting without damaging fitting near by. It may work I will never know. Never could actually get it to spry on the joint I brushed some on to try it and both sides of the joint were hot enough to melt solder. It will not spray out of the spray bottle. It is just not worth the time or the Money
5,Brilliant Brain!,"This CD from EMI features Dennis Brain, in my opinion the greatest horn player who ever lived. In his tragically brief life Brain recorded the definitive versions of numerous works, and although his Mozart horn concertos are my favorites, his treatment of Strauss is a close runner up.Despite these recordings being from the mid-1950s, the musicianship of Brain still makes these the best available. While I like Strauss, I find Hindemith a bit derivative and monotonous, although with Brain's treatment still a delight.These recordings are crisp and sonically well defined, despite the Strauss concertos having been recorded in mono. I am grateful to EMI for releasing these recordings on a single disc at a reasonable price. Horn lovers everywhere will relish in these recordings. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Richard Strauss Horn Concertos,"The music was just what I wanted for a late Christmas present, delivered safely and promptly. Have not heard the supporting music, but it will make a splendid contrast."
5,A very lucid treatment of Linux Kernel development,"Simply put this book is well written. The author makes difficult concepts accessible to even newbies. I own both editions, and the second one is even better than the first. This book would also be good as a supplement to the required text for a college-level course on operating systems where Linux is one of the OSes discussed (as is the case these days)."
5,Excellent book and easy to read,"Linux Kernel Development (2nd Edition) is a great book. It is written in as easy a style as possible for a topic as technical as the internal details of the Linux kernel. If you are someone with some programming experience who wants to learn how the Linux kernel works, this is a great place to start.The book goes into good detail for pretty much all of the main tasks the kernel performs. It includes simple code examples, with easy to understand explanations. If you need a book that goes line by line through the kernel... this is not for you. But, if you need a book that explains the basics thoroughly, but doesn't bore you to death with detail after detail, then buy this book already.Note: This book covers up to 2.6.10, which is starting to get a bit old. 2.6.26 is current as of this review, so some of this info is out of date, but still is helpful."
3,Off the Map,Joan Allen leads an outstanding ensemble cast that inlcudes Sam Elliott and Amy Brenneman. This is a whimsical delight that includes some great cinematography of the southwest. I recommend this movie as an enjoyable evening that harkens back toearlier time(1970s). The film deals with a loving family dealing with the severe and persistent depression of the father/husband.
5,living the simple life,The story is really good and the actors go well. Great direction. The movie gets you involved from minute one and keeps your interest to the very end. The movie makes you think about what we need or not in our lifes to be happy and at peace. I strongly recommend!
4,"You either get it, or you don't.","This film literally unfolds before you, breathing and living at its own pace. A beautiful re-telling of a young girl's unconventional (by modern standards) childhood in the New Mexico desert, Bo's story becomes a gentle catalyst of change for everyone around her. Each character's movements impact the other's with precision and depth."
2,Pass the popcorn...and the prozac.,"I wish Campbell Scott had realized how off-putting the ""precocious"" child actress in this film was. Every glance, every spoken word of her dialogue just made me cringe. I can't believe her forced performance didn't bother others more.The plusses? Joan Allen is TERRIFIC. The photography is fantastic.But the ""BO"" character? Man, if I lived around a precocious-every-word-of-dialogue-is-just-so-pert-and-perky-from-my-12-year-old-lips...I'd be catatonic and depressed like Sam Elliott, too. Pass the popcorn and the prozac! Skip this film."
2,I was looking forward to seeing this...,"After reading all of these good reviews, I really thought I was going to see a good movie. The only thing that kept me watching this movie, was the young girl. I couldn't understand what the hell this movie was about, it was ridiculous! I wish I could've gotten Charlie a gun, so he could shoot himself, and I wouldn't have to hear about his depression anymore. How anyone could give this movie a good review, is baffling to me! I gave one extra star for the young girls acting, otherwise I would have given it the minimum!"
1,Horrible Movie ! ! !,"Stay away from this post-feminist tripe. It casts a precocious 12-year-old girl along with three weak, ineffectual, dysfunctional, middle-aged men. Couldn't she have been given a childhood (for god's sake!) with friends, her own age, perhaps? And that sailboat? Very lame."
5,Holy Bible: New Living Translation - New & Old Testament,Great sound effects and narration. Great for Kids and Adults. Easy to use and get around to different books of the Bible. Great for computer or TV.
2,The Dramatization is really bad,"In the same way that the NKJV was done, the NLT decides to do the same thing. It's like listening to a Jay Ward cartoon. There were times during sad parts that because of the hammed up voice I was LOL&ROTF. It would have been better if Johnson would have just read it straight without other actors, or sound effects."
5,Bible on DVD,"An excellent narration of the Bible. A very good resource for bible study, enabling students to easily access any book, chapter or verse in the Bible."
1,I would even give these cd's one star but I had to check something,These bible cd's have so much music in them you can't even understand what is being said.
3,Fast reading,"Indeed, Amazon delivers! At first I was afraid my DVD would never arrive. The estimated delivery date was October 5, but the Brazilian Mail only sent my package on November 28. So, if you intent to bring this item to Brazil through standard mail be prepared to wait and pay a 60% import tax (I recently bought Ilumina Premium using DHL and the delivery was much faster).Although the narrator's voice is very pleasant, it is fast-paced. This shortcoming was already mentioned in another review and I endorse it. Since the video presentation is rather static, showing the text as an open book, I close my eyes and enjoy the audio (which is fast paced, you don't even notice the narrator's breathing). So, it was an interesting experience, the NLT is very good, and I hope future releases adress the audio speed more carefully."
5,Bible on DVD,I was thrilled! This is a high quality product I bought as a gift for my husband. He loves it!
5,Love It,This link has been added to my charm link bracelet to remind me of the birth & love of my children. Each piece added can have personal meaning to your life.
2,"Overwrought, melodramatic prose","As a collector of golden age SF, I hoped to like this, but I couldn't take it seriously.These stories were written in the 1930's for the pulps. The prose is way over the top as suited the venue at the time. The target audience was poorly educated, young and unsophisticated. They wanted cheap thrills and they got it with the pulps.I wish Haffner Press good fortune with their efforts. The series is attractively bound on quality paper and will be a find for collectors. I did notice a few word substitutions few readers are apt to notice. Given the size of the task, the prose is quite clean.If you enjoy being told rather than shown and enjoy colorful adjectives and radio play quality melodrama, you'll find this a treasure trove. But if you want to be entertained while reading well crafted prose, look instead to: Campbell, Van Vogt, Vance, Asimov, Pohl, Silverberg, Tiptree, Leiber, Kornbluth, Russell or Bester."
3,interesting early science fiction,"There were some good stories in this collection of early science fiction by Jack Williamson, but there were so many typos that it became quite annoying after awhile. The stories themselves were good, and you probably know what to expect from this era of science fiction, but whoever proof-read this did a terrible job."
2,Don't buy this book for the SharePoint information,"My review pertains only to the SharePoint section of this book, since that's what I was interested in. The information on implementing SharePoint is very high level and covers the same information contained in the user's manuals that are available from Microsoft's website.I was expecting this book to get into greater detail about a real-world implementation plan, including ideas on how to programmatically migrate an existing set of documents into a new SharePoint Portal, but no such luck. Instead, it breezes through each of the features, devoting little more than a paragraph per feature to explain how things work.It appears that the SharePoint information was thrown in at the last minute so that it could be one of the first books claiming to cover SharePoint. Save your money and wait for one of the other books that are scheduled to be release over the next few months."
1,Look elsewhere,"If you want to know what topics to consider for an E2k deployment, they're probably all mentioned here. If you want to know any details about those topics, there wasn't room. I had high hopes after listening to Mr. Morimoto's Microsoft webcast, but no more information is to be found here than the brief mentions he made. An example is found on p. 59, where five considerations for sizing and installation are listed. ""These areas are detailed in the 'Best Practice Recommendations' section,"" it says; the details amount to only nine lines, simply re-listing the topics. Disappointing."
1,guide to Berlin,"This book is so trite, mundane and uninteresting that it is hard to believe it is still in print. A complete waste of money"
5,Excellent Book!,"This book is loaded with pertinent details, and the information is presented in a readable, interesting style. The book is well organized so that you can use it to reference particular subjects, like dining, public transportation, the government, etc., or you can read it like a book, chapter by chapter. Very well done. Inside Germany would have been a great title too! I discovered many new things that should have been apparent to someone who has lived in Germany as long as I have."
2,"Shallow and brief, but better than nothing","I suppose that someone who knew absolutely NOTHING about German culture would find this book interesting and useful. But, if you already know a little bit and want to learn more (like me) you will likely be disappointed. Others have pointed out that each topic is covered briefly, and in my opinion, that's usually EXTREMELY briefly. I find the alphabetical organization of topics unhelpful, and would prefer to have similar subjects located together. I often had to guess several times to see which word the author would use to alphabetize a given topic. If you're looking for more than a quick-and-dirty introduction to German culture, skip this book and read ""Culture Shock! Germany"" instead."
4,A Quick Read,"This slim volume presents dozens of aspects of German culture. For example, why do Germans value privacy? Why do they always close windows when they feel a draft? I definitely learned a lot from this book. My only complaints is that it could have gone a little more in depth about the causes of German behavior. Also, this book is a little out of date. It was published in the 90's, so there is a lot of talk about Marks rather than Euros, and you read a lot about the reunification of Germany, which is not as hot a topic as it was in the 90's. Even with these weak points, I think you'll be able to learn a lot. I wish that the author would release a more up-to-date version, though."
4,"Very, very good","Great book. Very insightful. Great ""ice-breaker"" for conversations with Germans. If you visit Germany, compare what you learn in the book with what you experience for yourself while there.I hope the author updates the info and keeps this reference current (otherwise this would be a five star).Great book, really added to my trip to Germany."
3,Standard Fantasy Stuff,"The three stars are for the quality of writing from this new author. The story itself left me pretty cold. Generic medieval city setting. Generic orphan character who turns out to be something special. It's competently written... It's just a story I've read dozens and dozens of times before. On top of that, the first half was very slow, and I probably wouldn't have finished the book if I hadn't been on a plane. The chapters of Varis wandering around the slums reminded me of all those computer games where your first levels are stuck killing pansy baddies outside the city walls until you have enough EXP to go do something cool. Fortunately, those levels go by more quickly than the first half of this book did.That said, I thought the author had a confident voice with a lot of potential. Let's hope for something more original for his next book."
3,Enjoyable (though a bit long),"""The Skewed Throne"" follows an orphaned girl (V--) in a fantasy city. Surviving by stealing food, V-- meets a cop and starts earning food (no money, just food) as a spy, locating criminals. V-- has a fascinating magical power, that enlivens this novel. Expect the poor part of town, dagger fights, and great character motivation.The ending is forecast way too strongly, the length a bit long, and the fights entirely rediculous. Reminiscent of old Westerns, the least wound kills instantly, but V-- can receive any wound without consequence. V--'s motivations are well presented and consistent, and I liked that she stays desperately poor for most of the book. Overall, an entertaining and fun read, worth the purchase.This book will appeal to readers who enjoyedDevlin's Luck (Sword of Change, Book 1)orForged Without Fire: A Champion for CatloverorCast in Shadow (The Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)."
4,Great Stroller,"Quality construction, good Italian design. My one complaint would be the fact that because of its 12-wheel set up, its not the easiest stroller to maneuver. Overall, an excellent product."
5,His Best for Pure Guitar Talent,"Unlike most Montrose Fans, this is the first album of his I ever heard. To date it's still my favorite of his as it shows his true talents both as a composer and guitarist. I've never been a fan of most of his songs w/ lyrics but these straight instrumental tracks really hit the sweet spot for those wanting to hear the ""music"". He is truly amazing when he doesn't get held back by trying to add lyrics. His orchestration is much better fleshed out. Kinda along the lines of Joe Satriani and Eric Johnson - both at their best in their instrumentals.This one is arguably not as ""hard rock"" as most his other works but still rocks. If you like harder rock but still instrumentals, look at ""Mutatis Mutandis"" (a great album) and ""Speed of Sounds"". If you want words as well, his best IMHO is Gamma 3 - much better thought out lyrics and harmonies than much of his more famous works."
4,Ronnie Montrose-Open Fire CD,This hard to find lp is on CD and contains the instrumental version of Town Without Pity.I make this difficult to get cd available on CD-R FREE with a bonus 7 minute version of Town Without Pity LIVE for collectors in need of this classic.Contact me at smoothbluz11 @ yahoo.com and I'll get you a FREE COPY(I DO NOT SELL CD-R'S)for your collection.
1,No power,"Cute, just what my daughter wanted, but could not pick up a crumb or small dot from a hole punch"
2,Cute but.....,Got for my wife because she collects pigs. It is cute for that but the suction on the one we got did not vacuum up the crumbs on counters very well - so found it not a useful tool. Just something to display.
3,excellent service,I've ordered this product before and always got prompt service. The product itself works very well and is fun to use. That's why I've given them to friends.
4,cute,i was drawn into the cuteness of this item and was pleasently surprised when i used it. it is really just a crumb vac because it doesnt have a lot of power to it; dont get me wrong though because it works for what it is made for. thumbs up!
5,Desk Vacuumns,They make a great gift and they really work!!! My craft friends really love them and they are so cute!!!
2,"Cute, but.....","It takes batteries, which, well you know how that goes....when the batteries aren't fully charged. There is not a lot of suction. It's a cute item, but doesn't do much in the vacuuming area. I would buy it as a prank gift, or novelty item, but not to really clean with. Which also means, don't pay too much for it."
2,Pig vacuum,I recieved my vaccum pig and it wasnt at all a strong vaccum. It didnt pick up anything small or light. It was more like air was blowing out.
5,Excellent product...excellent service.,I ordered this for my daughter (who loves pigs) for a Christmas present and she loved it! It came in time - and works great! It's quite a conversation piece on her table. Good product...good seller.
1,One Of The Worst Tributes To Monk I've Heard Yet,"Ben Riley is a monster drummer. His work with Monk in the 60s was stellar. Riley has participated in many of these tribute albums, but the only one that really caught my attention was the one he did with Charlie Rouse called ""Four In One,"" which was comprised of Kenny Barron on piano, Rouse on saxophone, Riley on drums, and Buster Williams on bass. This was an excellent tribute to pick up instead of this one.My problem with with album isn't the fact that it's a pianoless quartet, but rather a mundane take on some of Monk's originals. Much of the music is way too busy to be appreciated because of the over abundance of horns that sound very unnatural. This recordiing just didn't flow like Monk's music. It just seemed way too forced."
5,"Warm and Witty, Highly Recommended","Warm and witty, this eclectic collection of stories, poems, and essays immerse the reader in the life of an emergency physician in rural South Carolina. Although there is plenty here to cause medical personnel to chuckle, there's moments of laughter and pensiveness that many will be able to identify with: watching over sleeping children, coping with fears, driving down country roads. Highly recommended."
3,short stories,I bought this for my son-in-law. It is a book of short stories by a Christian ER doctor. Some were very interesting; some were not so much.
3,a little disapointed,"This puzzle is very interesting but, unfortunately, because of the shape of pieces, it is very difficult to keep the pieces together, except the part with the ocean and Canada. We wanted to stick the pieces with scotch tape, but, in this case, where is the fun?Think twise before you order this item."
2,Bought for my work truck,"I like the looks of this chest, like the fact that its made out of plastic so corrosion is not a factor.Now for the bad, its not anywhere near water tight, proof, resistant. If it rains expect to have water inside the chest. If anything rubs up against the bar for the latch system do not expect to be able to lock it untill you move said item. Also if you really pack it and it distorts you will have a hard time closing it / latching it untill you reorganize and remove items that are pushing it out of shape."
2,wouldn't recommend this for all those hard core anime fans,I ordered this thinking it would be really good because it got an average of five stars and I'm always looking for a good new anime to add to my collection. The fist four episode is one completed story line. But the episodes after it were practically the same. The five main characters all take turns being murdered one way another. Then the next set starts and the character(s) who had just died in the last episode is alive again. Its like a reset button was hit and they are giving you all different ways they can die. It also raised more questions then it answered. All in all I wouldn't recommend this for all those hard core anime fans
5,When they Cry,"This is what i've been waiting for, a complete release of one of my favorite series ever. The packaging is pretty top notch too, with a (menacingly) stylish outside cover to house your three thin packs. The story is anout a boy named Keiichi Maebara and his life in the village he just moved to, Hinamizawa. There he meets his friends Mion, Rena, Satoko, and Rika. There are many morals in the story you can spot if you look hard enough, like the impotance of trust and friendship. Now don't get me wrong if you think this is another sappy, ""moe"", slice of life, etc. You will be caught off guard by the spilling of blood, heartless murder and bone-chilling laughter. If gore and violence is a turn off, then this isn't the best choice to make. But if you're willing to make the sacrifice of not being able to sleep for a few days, then ""When they Cry"" is right for you!"
4,good but too short,"I like this WBCC record too but not as much as Horror. I got this after getting Horror only because I was so impressed with that record. I knew this was a different vocalist but liked the samples I heard and so, I picked it up. I am not disappointed in the music or the sound although the production screams ""independant"". Pretty good stuff here and it does sound consistant, style wise with Horror, the songs are just on the short side and the hooks of Horror are fewer and further between. I'm happy with the disc but would have liked to have another 20 minutes or so of music for my $. Nice debut, pick it up and then go get Horror if you want more and better."
5,A book that's as good as its cover,"As an interested academic in a completely unrelated field (chemistry) Palmer's book was only the second cognitive psychology text that I had ever read. It was an ""eye opener."" There should be awards given to authors who commit themselves and succeed at the task of what Palmer has done here. The book was comprehensive and didn't pull any punches, but was still very readable. The quality of the writing and organization leads me to assume that the man is a gifted teacher as well. The layout, glossary, index, and organization of the text were clearly constructed with the reader in mind. Five star reviews at Amazon.com should be reserved for books of this quality."
1,just love it,just like old movies and this is great is kept on my shelf and watches every now and then wonderful
3,Not as good as I thought,"I am kind of disappointed after I get the book. Mr. Harmann try to make a great book, but it is simply too difficult to get enough information about Fw 187 to make one."
2,Dark moon,I didn't finish this book. I found it too wordy and it just dragged. I will probably go back and finish it sometime.
3,Fun,"This one was a little predictable, but still a fun read. It was worth the cost and I would recommend it."
2,So So read,This book is not nearly as interesting as I had hoped. I do not recommend it. It just isn't fresh or new. I feel like I have already read the plot.
5,Can't put it down!,"Just finished ""Dark Moon Crossing"", my third novel by Sylvia Nobel in the Kendall O'Dell Mystery series. It is difficult to say which one of these three novels I have liked the best, but they seem to just get better and better. I did not want to put the books down, they really keep you on the edge of your seat! Makes me think of Mary Higgins Clark style of writing, but much more suspenseful! Love these books!!"
4,Good read,"I enjoyed the mystery and was surprised by the solution. That's what a good mystery is all about. A few things were questionable such as the amount of rattlesnakes that were rounded up. I lived in the Sonoran desert for ten years and I only saw five or six rattle snakes the whole time. The coolers used for snake transport didn't make sense to me so I picked up on that clue. Kendall seemed to be a real klutz but also very intelligent--I liked the character although she seemed to be unstable at times. In several chapters there was a little too much ""telling"" and not enough showing. The unexpected heinous crime at the end as well as a likeable protagonist are what made this book a good read."
3,Dark Moon Crossing,"Dark Moon Crossing did not care for the female character, story not that well written. I would not recomend to any one .Crossing"
2,New author for me,"I have been trying to get through this book, but it just doesn't hold my interest. Don't think I would by another book from this author."
3,Ho -Hum,"I am another one who almost did not finish this book. The Story starts out slow, and the author's verbosity also made it slighty boring (How many ways can you refer to the moon in one chapter?). I did not read the other two Kendall O'Dell mysteries, and after this I do not think I am willing to give them a try. The story line about border crossings in Arizona is a good one, however that author is static in her writng as to different events that take place. The flow of the story line was just not my cup of tea, I would have liked this much better with a different presentation. I can understand how those who gave this book a better rating did so, however this book was not written the way I prefer to have mysteries presented."
3,Dark moon crossing Kendall Odell mystery s,Good reading fast paced hard to put down keeps you on the edge of your seat mystery readers well like it
5,Page turner,Heroine is one who opens the basement door often. Very entertaining with a lot of the author's thoughts on immigration and the border problems.
3,Not what I expected....,"I'm not suprised that George McCorkles ""American Street"" didn't thrill me. It was an impulse purchase, to expand my MTB collection. having said that, it's no wonder George was never the featured vocalist in MTB. Here his vocals are passable. What stands out are the song strucures. I would recommend this CD to the southernrock/MTB enthuisiat only."
3,wrong item but received refund,"Received item in timely fashion but was wrong item. The seller did not have the item in their inventory. They told me to keep the item and issued a full refund, which was nice."
1,probably incompatible with Mac OS10.4,"Although my scanner is a 5900, which will not work with my new Mac (G4, running Tiger 10.4.2), this one uses the same ""ScanWizard 5"" software package so the odds are pretty good that the 6100 won't work on current Macs either. This failure is after numerous contacts with their tech support and repeated downloads of drivers, but for some reason it will not load the ""scanner finder"" - obviously a critical component. I have given up and will upgrade, probably to a Canon, but what a waste of what SHOULD be a still-functional item."
5,Wilson's Disease for the Patient and Family,This is a very easy to understand guide for those who have a concern about the rare condition of Wilson's. A must have for anyone with a family history. It will either educate you or put your mind at ease.
5,informative,For any family or person needing info on this illness all questions are covered easy to read and understand
3,Dodge Viper GT2 - Maisto,This is a cool diecast but when I set it next to my BigTime diecast I see that I should have bought a BigTime diecast. The doors are the only thing that open and the detail is not what I have on my BigTime diecast.This is one of two of my first diecast to order and see that is there is a difference in manufactures.
5,amazing,"This show just keeps getting better and better, i just cant get enough of it. If your into anime you'll love this item."
5,action packed with lots of comedy,a very enterprising product if you love high seas adventures and a motley crew of friends searching for their dreams.
1,No Return Junk,"Since this item is not returnable and is not the correct item to fit in the Leadsinger Karaoke system that I also purchased from amazon, it's useless and I doubt that I will be returning to amazon.com ever again!"
1,not satisfied,I bought this product a month ago. They shipped it to me right away but the problem is the first 57 song don't want to play..It doesn't even show the titles when I pressed the song numbers. Choose other chip. this one is not good. I don't recommend it.
3,Good Not Great!!!,This Game Is Good Not Great Because It Is Real Time Strategy But The Actual Variety Of Units Is Awful!!! And Thats All That Really Holds It Back From Being A Huge Success. The Max # Units (The Number Of Units You Can Put Out At One Time) Is Not Defined. And Your Resources Near Your Starting Point Are So Limited. Plus Sometimes It's Nearly Impossible To Select Certain People Because They Get Too Close To Walls So The Cursor Can't Get Them. I Had Fun Setting Up Home Bases So You Should Too!
2,"SuperInvisible, Crappy VHS transfer...","I love the movie, but the transfer sucks donkey balls. The disc even stops playing at a certain point and has to be restarted. Good thing it was cheap! The only reason I bought this is it was the only one I could find anywhere."
1,Very poor copy,"This is a terrible copy. Looks like its from video tape and the video tape is from a very poor, grainy, dirty master."
5,Insight to youth thinking,"When one follows their body's (mind) calling (F to M or M to F) there is a price to pay. Mentally,friends, jobs, and money. This film gives insight to the problems youth face to change their body to the correct gender. I wanted to do it in 1963 but did not know what was bothering me. After the internet at the age of 73 I completed my change to a transwoman. I hope this film helps our youth to search for help if they are questioning their self.Billie"
4,worth every penny,"A very entertaining and useful documentary to my collection. You get drawn into the lives and struggles of the 4 students as they go thur their school year. Very useful to non TG who are trying to understand by showing them a ""human"" face to TG's struggles without it being dry like a normal documentary or fictionalize as in a movie."
3,"Good film, but where is the sex in trans-sexualism?","I viewed this film after reading a favorable review in the magazine Transformation: A Magazine for Men Who Enjoy Being Women. There were stills from the film, including pictures of the main characters. The magazine itself is chock full of pictures of nude transsexuals, in various states of transition--most often, with voluptuous breasts and a penis--and lots of ""how to"" information.I liked the film but wanted to hear more about sex--in particular, the sexual motivations of Gabbie and Raci. I wanted to know why, from a sexual standpoint, they wanted to have sex reassignment surgery and become women. The magazine gave me some clues, but I wanted to hear it from them."
5,Italian Charm,I wasn't sure how my favorite painting would look on this tiny charm. I was amazed when I received it. It is beautiful and is a great addition to my bracelet. So glad I bought it.
5,Has Jerry Reed ever done anything BAD?,"The first cut on the CD about Jerry Springer is funny, but doesn't sound like Jerry Reed, and is somewhat dated humor. But the rest of the album is first-class, typical Jerry Reed material. He is under-recognized for his ability as a guitar-picker, and his vocals are still good for his age. I'm glad Jerry is still spending studio time; he is an asset to the music business. I also wish he'd do more movies. Remember how he stole the show in Smokey and the Bandit? Recommended!"
2,Lady bug rip off,If you are buying this product to use only once you will be glad. It is very flimsy and looks like it is made by a first grader. Not worth the money if you plan on using it more than once
4,"For $6, can't complain!","Yes, it's true. This is pretty flimsy. But, my 2-year-old daughter loved wearing this for halloween, and after wearing it twice, it's still in pretty good shape and she still loves wearing it. For 6 bucks, I'm pretty pleased, and even a month after halloween the wings still get good use, and I think they will for at least a few more months."
1,Broke within five minutes of opening the box,"I didn't expect much for the cost, but I was still disappointed. One of the antennae fell off the headband within five minutes of me opening the box. My daughter put them on her head and didn't touch them... and they still fell apart. She had the wings on for about 15 minutes when one of the two straps snapped. She wasn't playing rough or pulling on them, it simply snapped while she was wearing it.I don't think I've ever purchased anything so shoddily made. It's now six hours since I opened the box, and it's packaged up and ready for UPS to pick up tomorrow. Thank you Amazon for the easy return process."
5,love the wings,My granddaughter has so much fun flitting around the garden in her ladybug wings. It gives her an outfit for her creative side.
4,A good book,"I give this book four stars because it is a very good book ,but not the best. This book is about an history class experiment that way out of control and goes clear through the school, nobody knows that it is that bad. There are two students that warn the teacher to stop it before it gets more out of control."
4,Feel The Wave,The Wave by Morton Rhue is one of the best books I've ever read! The book tells you the story about the history teacher Ben Ross who loves do to experiements with his students. One of this Experiements is The Wave. Ben tries to give his students a taste of how people lived in Nazi-Germany and why most of the german people doesn't stand up against Hitler. But then he lost controll and the experiement goes out of hand.When you read the book you will feel that you even as a reader becomes more and more a member of the Wave. So the book is a good prof for the fact that racism is in all of us and that you have to fight against it.
4,nice book,"i've read the book, and i think it's pretty nice, the book had suspence, action, a good theme and plot, and didn't leave me bored at any point, so i didn't have to skip a few pages, the book isn't a kiddy book, so we had nice situations, and some cuss words to make sure that it's *not* a kiddy book, so my epinion is: good book, good title, good plot, you should get it"
3,It's not so good.,"I think that the book is for teenagers but I don't it's so good. In the beginning of the book you,ve get to learn about world war 2 and you see how the students react, thats quite good. But seriously I would not recommend to buy this book maybe rent it but don't buy it. I think the book became boring. I don't think that you get in to the book at least i didn't, if you don't like this kind of books."
5,The Wave was the BEST book I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!,I read The Wave in my honors reading class. I really enjoyed this book because I liked learning about the Holocaust. Throughout the book I learned how the Jews must have felt and the actions that took place against them. I thought that the book was a good way to teach students about the Holocaust.
5,A great book - I enjoyed it!,"In my opinion, The Wave is a great book because it shows how Germans went along with Hitler and the Nazis. It showed how the students went along with The Wave and they really didn't see what was going on. This book is insperational and you won't be able to put it down. My suggestion would be that everyone read this book. I don't read alot of books, but I would read this one again and again!"
2,poorly written,It's fairly difficult to believe that high school seniors could be so stupid. Recommend this book at the 6th grade level.
3,Not That Bad,I watched the movie in school while studying dictatorship and it seemed to short. it was hard to belive this guy took his power to such and extream! People got hurt because of the wave and they were turning into brainwashed minions. Im sure i would like the book better. It is very good so buy it ALSO BUY TANGIRINE AND THE CRUSADER BY MY FAVORITE ATHOUR EDWARD BLOOR
3,My Opinion About The Wave!,"I liked the book called The Wave. It was done by a man named Todd Strasser. I think he is a good author, and he wrote this book for a good reason. It teaches not only us but the students in The Wave a disipline leason. I learned that you should make your own desicions instead of somebody else doing it for you. Thats why I rate this book a stared book. But it is stupid in some ways. Someways it is stupid is like when, well it was really the whole book. I didn't like The Wave when Mr. Ross showed the class; The Wave. The students really liked The Wave and did whatever Mr. Ross told them to. I think that was the most stupides part in the book. But other than that, I liked THE WAVE!!!!"
2,the book is very superficial but adequate to teenagers.,"In this book the characters' psychology is too superfical,even though the book could be very pleasant if you're interested in short novels to spend an evening with. A positive aspect of the novel is the fact that you get immerged in it very easily thanks to realistic aspect of the book and the easy writing ."
4,A great book,"This book is a fantastic story base on a true story. It tells you about how the Nazi Party could have stard and evolve so fast just like a wave in Germany. But to know how did one single person stop the fanatic mouvement, well you will have to read to book for yourself....."
4,Endings,I have to say over all it was a great book. but even more i liked the fact of how they ended the wave movement. To have something like that happen and you lead could become so intoxicating that it would really be hard to stop it. i just have to say i bet that he will not be doing that next year.
4,The Wave,"The wave is a class gone out of control. Students are telling other students to join or they will be beaten. The wave is a reenactment of Hitler's campaign to destroy all Jews. Some students realize what is happening to their friends and school. These students are out to stop the wave. One student looses everything she has to stop this. She looses her boyfriend, friends, and her favorite teacher. Since the wave is like Hitler the wave acts exactly like him. One student refuses to join the wave, the members beat him to the ground because of it. After the beating they find out the student was Jewish. The wave is out of control now. They must do something ....."
4,My opinion about The Wave,"I think that the story was strange. Because how could the students join the movement so fast, only a couple of days and they took over school. The book was a litle slow sometimes and very interesting the next moment. Another strange thing is that, how could Ben Ross end the experiment so fast. The book showed an example of how a few people could scare so many. The meaning with the book is to get people to questioning and criticize."
3,The Wave,"The book ""The Wave"" was based on a true incident that took place in Palo Alto, California in 1969.Ben Ross's class studied how the German people could have followed Hitler and the Nazis. Mr. Ross creates an experiment that went a little too far! When the experiment began in a classroom it spreads really quickly to the whole school and through out the city. The classes motto was "" Strength Through Dicipline, Strength Through Community, and Strength Through Action"" that motto governed the entire school.But the thing is Laurie Saunder and Davis Collins (two of the main characters) recognize The Wave for what it really is.Can they stop it before it is too late?Read the book ""The Wave"" to see what happens. I personally did not think it was a great book, but you personally would have to make that decision and I would give this book a 3 out of 5 stars!"
3,"A well written book, but everything seems too eazy . . .","I had to read this book for my English class, and I didn`t find it too bad. It is a well writen book, wich makes it accessible even to beginers. The theme of this book, fascism, is a good idea, and the effects are well shown, though it is too much superficial. The whole process seems going too easily, I am not that sure that students would follow so blindly, so fast. Then again, I can be wrong. . . I recommend this book to every teachers whom`s interest is in racism"
1,The Wave!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I think this book was abominable!!!!! I will never read a book like this again!!! It was so boring!!! I fell asleep reading it was so boring!!!
1,BORING,"This book was very disappointing. It had many Grammar errors. This book was about history but VERY, VERY boring history."
3,"Pretty good plot, but slow as well","THIS BOOK WAS ONE OF THE FEW BOOKS I HAVE READ RECENTLY THAT CONTAINED A WELL WRITTEN PLOT. IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE HOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE IN AN ACTUAL SCHOOL. ALTHOUGH THE BOOK WAS INTREGUEING, IT WAS OFTEN SLOW AT TIMES. OVERALL, I GIVE THE BOOK A THREE. I WOULD GLADLY RECOMEND IT TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN HOW PEOPLE CAN BE INFLUENCED BY SOMEONE AND FOLLOW THEM BLINDLY."
2,My own oppinion about the Wave,"I think the wave was very good, because it was about the nazism. And the reader learns that the nazism is no good. The book was also very good because the story real happen in the reality. The student in the book really became nazism after a while. The student dint learn that the nazism really was badly. David diden't either like so much his girl friend because he had become a bad guy. But after everything become better, because the teacher explain to the student about nazism. And they realise that is was real bad to become a nazism. The book was really good."
4,"Teen Son Saw Movie, Still Enjoyed","Had picked this up for my 14y.o. son, who has add & needs encouragement to read. He usually enjoys novels dealing w/teen peer pressure & related ethical questions. Turns out he had seen a movie version of this in Social Studies class last yr in 7th grade, but decided to read it anyway. He found it a good read."
2,"poorly written, but interesting concept","It's a quick and easy read but it is hard to believe that it is based on facts. After a bit of research on the internet it appears that there was indeed a class experiment like this, but it did not happen the way it is portrayed in the book. Reality is more complicated."
4,This was a good book!,"= This was a good book!Reviewer: Quinones from Peekskill, NYThis book took place in Palo Alto, California in Gordon High School. It started when Mr.Ross(the teacher) showed the class amovie about the Holocaust. ""Experiment of the wave"", strengh through disciplne and strengh through community. ""The Wave"" isthe group that joined the experiment which took over a large number of students. The administrators of the school start toobserve the class with the experiment.Two students opposed ""The Wave"" and one was threatened and the other one got beat up. Lauri also opposed ""The Wave""and wrote an article about it in the school newspaper ""The Grapevine"".At the end of the book, ""The Wave"" was dissolved although it taught a great lesson, I think it did more bad than good.This book was 3rd Person (Someone else is telling the story)Lauri Saunders- Student, editor of school newspaperMr. Ross- History TeacherDavid Collins- Lauri's boyfriendREAD THIS BOOK!!!"
2,The Wave: A terrible book!!!,"I don't understand that the pupils agreed to be a part of what Mr Ross started; The Wave. The pupils should have realized, that the experiment was something that went out of hand. They must have read or at least heard about the war and all the terriable things hat happened. I would never submit to be a part of such a group ike that. I think this book was kind of interesting because it was a true story and that people really have reacted like this. But it wasn't at all what i've expected. I wouldn't read it again...."
2,"decent book for a 10 year old, not suitable for adults","I was under the impression that this was a book written for adult readers. It was pretty clear after reading the first few pages that I was dead wrong. The dialogue is sappy and unrealistic; no real teenagers talk like this, and I doubt they ever did. The plot is pretty shallow. And the writing style is way dumbed down. This is below the reading level of most teenagers, even, so I think it must be targeted at 10 to 12 year olds. And for them, this is probably a good and educational novel. But as an adult reader, I was disappointed with the book."
2,The ending was stupid and the book was boring.,"I read ""The Wave"" for my 8th Grade Honors Reading Class. I did not enjoy this book because of the way it was written. I thoughjt it was utmost boring and the ending was really stupid. I expected a lot more and was really disappointed with what I read."
1,An awfull book !!!!,I don't understand that the pupils agreed to be a part of what Mr Ross started; The Wave. The pupils should have realised that the experiment was something that went out of hand. They must have read or at least heard about the war and all the terrible things hat happened. I would never submit to be a part of such a group like that. I think this book was kind of interesting because it was a true story and that people really have reacted like this. But it wasn't at all what I've expected. I wouldn't read it again....
1,Ain't good enough,"I don't like it at all! It was boring, heavy boring. I don't like it because it was'nt funny or exciting. I don't like that kind of books Well, I don't like books at all. The only thing that is weird is that the pupils agree to be a part of Mr Ross expirement, The Wave. It's stupid. That's all!Bye!"
3,"A direct book for those who wish to learn more about Nazi,GE","This book is a great book if you enjoy short novels that give you all the information directly without you having to read between the lines. I didn't like it so much, because I am a sort of Laurie who saw it all coming. It is a must-read for those who aren't aware of the small things"
3,it is good,"This book is a good book but it is kind of like a goosebumps , it is too easy to read and sometimes descriptions are very boring , you can even guess what is going to happen since the 50th pageIn the positive way , it is a good book fun to read , and interesting ,"
4,Very Nice Book,"I think 'The Wave' was very interesting and exciting. 'The Wave' was a good book. First of all was written clearly,so it was easy to understand. The next reason that I enjoyed this book was because it was a true story"
4,A thought-provoking account...relevant to today's issues.,"For the past 10 years, I have included The Wave in my curriculum for junior high gifted students before their class trip to Washington, DC. The story helps them understand the feelings of empowerment that come from belonging to a group. Though 30 years old, the story is relevant to the social issues and events of today. The Wave is an ideal adolescent text to use as a springboard for discussions about individual thought, gang activity, and the psychology of propaganda."
5,JUDGE THIS BOOK BY ITS COVER,"You can judge this book by its cover...but let me tell you...its cover ROCKS.I read this book out of boredom. I was waiting for a few friends, saw it, picked it up, BAM, forget the friends because I was having fun reading about this wacky experiment. Based on a true story....well..lets just say some tricky stuff happens.A lot of people are complaining because this book does not have a good character description piece like, say, harry potter, but I like that type of writing. I want to see the characters the way I want to see them. After all, even though the author wrote it, the images are different for everyone who read the book.Wicked awesome book. It could be read my an elementary school student, but definitely can be enjoyed by someone in college.5/5"
1,Like headaches?,"Used melatonin in the past without the extra ingredients. Knock-out does not make me sleepy, I wake up in the night - never happened before. Every morning I wake with a headache. After realizing ( 6 nights ) this was causing the problem - stopped taking - sleep better and refreshed in morning."
2,Style over substance,"The glossy photos in this pricey book can help spark your imagination to come up with interesting-looking starters. I found several of the actual recipes, however, bland and uninteresting. Also beware that many of the photos are printed backwards or upside down so captions don't match. While sometimes pretty and pleasant, the look of the food is frequently rococo and overdone--the book doesn't follow its own advice to keep the presentation simple and the decorations in harmony with the setting. ..."
1,Not impressed,Definitely not a cutting edge book of appetizers. I was hoping to use some of the recipes for catering but the book is pretty much worthless. Definitely glad I only paid $3 something for it.
5,"Great for freezing/double boiler, very multi use","This was a gift item. A gift item I really like and use a lot.I have never used this for frothing. I don't drink fancy coffee drinks/espresso.I place this in the freezer when I want a container really cold to whip cream, milk or eggs. Works best with immersion blenders. Handheld mixer beaters are not long enough to reach bottom. Keeps very cold in fridge after freezing. Best for making low fat whipped milk. I have also been known to drink iced tea out of it. I have also used it to make simple ice cream.I also used this as a double boiler along with a small rack in the bottom of a large pot. Scrambled eggs are best in a double boiler. Great for fudge pudding. Will go from double boiler to fridge without having to change containers. Allow to cool down first or it will sweat and water will get on pudding.I have never noticed a metallic taste when items were left in container for a few days. Item is also quite sturdy without being overly heavy."
5,Used this in my soapmaking,"I didn't use this for the purpose they intended but found it to be an excellent product, great price and was very pleased with my purchase."
5,Time Saver - short and to the point summaries.,This book is a great little source of info on Vitamines. Can be used as a quick guide to vitamines for the everyday person. Most sections are only a page long. The format is like a Vitamine FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions. Great price.
5,the book explains all you need to know about vitamins,"dr, weil is honest and down to earth he explains both the pro's and con's.he tells you how much of a vitamin or mineral a person should take.in this day and age of uncaring doctors at least there is one doctor who gives you both sides of the medicine and vitamin world"
1,A Total Waste of Money-A Big Disappointment,This LITTLE Booklet does not provide comprehensive information about vitamins and minerals. Short questions and answers do not give enough information to be of any help. You will be very disappointed with this booklet if you are searching for in depth guidance. The title is very misleading.
1,This book does not worth 4 dollars,Information in this very small book is not up to date. This book does not worth $4. Don't buy this book. Go online to search for updated information is cheaper.
4,A wiccan da vinci code!,"I loved the suspense - and the way the author draws you into the lives of these women and their amazing journey. It is the power of the women who make this novel work - not trickery or supernatural forces. We like them and care about what happens to them. I stayed up all night to finish this book.(hmmmmm .. .will there be a sequel?)Not only is it a great read, but anyone who reads this book with an open mind is sure to be enlightened about wiccan culture. I know I was! I am not wicca - though I am intrigued by the power of faith. This author writes with passion and intelligence on a subject that is vastly misunderstood."
2,Nice pictures but way too flimsy.,"The other reviewers are right on the money when they say this product is flimsy. After I finally managed to tie the thin threads (which you have to cut yourself), I bent the rods when trying to secure them in the tiny little holes in the plastic hubs. Finally got those rods straightened only to have them fall out when the most gentle touch was applied. I gave up at this point and put this tangled mess away for a time when I have some more patience. Only buy this if you have the time and presence of mind to muddle with the unforgiving materials. There has to be a better way!"
1,Dissatisfied Customer,I purchased this product to be included in a Solar System themed child's room. The product was very flimsy and difficult to put together. It does not hang like it's advertised. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone; it's a total waste of money.
5,good educational resource,I decorated my classroom today. The theme is about the space and I loved the product. It looks pretty cool! I didnt assemble anything. I just hang the planets in order and they look super nice !!
2,Downgraded Mobile,"The solar system mobile is a classic. The beautiful photographic renditions of the planets have become a staple in children's education. However, this edition of the NASA mobile has been substantially downgraded: the planets and sun have been shrunk and are much smaller than in older mobile editions. There is a dark ""shadow"" rim around all planets and the sun, meant to give it a more 3 D appearance but only makes the colours appear less bright and adding a somber touch. The paper is thin. The construction overall flimsy. But the biggest minus: The mobile, just a slab of cardboard paper, comes in a shipping box worthy of a lighting fixture shipping. A huge box and loads of paper packing material. This is awful! I was incensed. I do not want to leave the ecological foot print of a mammoth when I just order a 6 ounce paper sheet! Overall: Much too expensive for what it is."
4,Nice mobile,This mobile is pretty good sized and the planets are fairly sturdy. I recommend it for anyone interested in the solar system... would also be nice in a classroom setting.
3,Don't put this up where it will move!,"The thin threads that you hang the planets with started breaking the day after Christmas(we hung it on Christmas day). My grandson wanted the mobile in his room where there is an overhead fan, and he was very excited that the planets ""moved around the sun"" when we got it put up! Because of the constant motion, the threads broke quickly. I wish it had been a bit more sturdy. Perhaps the thread could be replaced with nylon thread? The rods *do* bend, but my grandchildren didn't seem to mind! All in all, it was a hit.......but very short lived."
2,Lame,I can't believe how difficult it is to find a darn solar system mobile. Cardboard cutouts?? I could've made one and it would look better.Don't bother with this.
1,|Wrong format,"Being sent from the USA the DVD was the wrong format for my DVD player so I could not watch the content. We should be advised of this before ordering.Yours, thoroughly disatisfied, Michael Thomas"
4,Amazing survival story,"I anxiously awaited the release of this English translation after I saw the movie. In comparison, there are a few differences in the plot, but the story in both is moving. My primary reason for wanting to read the book was to understand the characteres better, to hear that inner voice that does not translate well on film. The book certainly provided this, though some times I found myself frustrated with the lengthy descriptions of secondary characters, such as the Professor and Diane. Still, the chapters that do delve more closely into the hearts and minds of Regina, Walter, Jettel and Owuor do not disappoint. Overall, though the writing at times wavers between meandering and powerfully direct, the story is heartbreaking and inspiring. I look forward to the sequel."
2,Bad writing or bad translating?,"I must confess that I read only two-thirds of this novel, and then went to the movie, which is much better written. I lost my patience with the long similes in the novel that slowed down the story. In one paragraph I counted three long similes in four sentences. The story does not ""flow"" and I got tired of counting the pages until the end of the chapter."
4,Psychological history,"Saul's therapized perspective of cultural dynamics in the nation-state is really entertaining and a bit perverse. Canada needs a good cognative therapist, it seems, and Saul is just the guy."
2,Disappointing,"Saul is now straining desperately to be different and provocative. This comfortable, central Canadian establishment voice seems to me largely to miss both the nature of Canada and the genuinely stupid developments occurring with respect to Federal power and the senseless and dangerous ethnically based politics of Native policies."
1,Jane Doe,"I have not seen this particular ""Jane Doe"" movie. I purchased another ""Jane Doe"" movie with Rob Lowe and Teri Hatcher in it."
1,Shame on EMI,"The quality of the sound on this reissue is absolutely awful. So bad that the superb qualities of the performance can hardly be determined by listening to this horror.The sound goes far beyond just the limitations of mono sound. I have many excellent sounding mono recordings. But this one is just plain bad. Beecham's lush orchestral support is buried in metallic, distorted sound. Bjorling's wonderfully silky voice sounds thin here.Contrary to what others have reported, this recording was originally made in both stereo and mono. How do I know this? EMI issued the stereo version on LP in Europe, and I have a copy. The sound on my copy is full, warm, rich, highly detailed, and without any noticeable distortion. What magnificence!What needs to be done to get EMI to reissue the stereo version in the US? Their treatment of this superb performance is shameful."
2,"Not great, but the holes match what was there originally","I bought these to replace some sash locks that were missing, and the holes in these lined up with the old screw holes in the window sash. They fit. They work. They're cheap steel stamped parts. I would have preferred locks of better quality, if I could have found some with the proper hole spacing."
5,Dark and Majestic,"David Julyan's score for THE PRESTIGE was one of the key elements in sustaining the film's foreboding atmosphere, the sense that every victory will be undermined by tragedy. The soundtrack is very dark, but in a beautiful and thrilling way. The ethereal orchestration invites comparison to Brian Eno's darkest ambient endeavors, such as ON LAND, Fripp & Eno's NO PUSSYFOOTING, and ""An Index of Metals"" from EVENING STAR. As in Eno's ambient music, timbre, harmony, and texture figure more prominently melody and harmony. Perhaps this radical approach is what put some of the other reviewer's off. Julyan's THE PRESTIGE soundtrack is more likely to appeal to connoisseurs of composers such as Gyorgy Ligetti and Krzysztof Penderecki than to listeners accustomed to the heroic fanfares of Jonathan Williams."
4,A prestigious soundtrack,"Contrary to some reviews, this score offers a lot more variety than one might expect - though there's a definite sense of mystery and foreboding to every track. It's unlike any other soundtrack in that it puts the emphasis on atmosphere rather than melody, and if you like the mood of the film, you will certainly enjoy this album.Highlights are 'A New Trick', featuring a more positive, almost optimistic feel; 'Man's Reach Exceeds His Imagination', with the most bold statement of the main theme, and 'Sacrifice', in which the music reaches an almost terrifying climax.So if you're in for something different, and you enjoyed the movie - then don't hesitate to buy this mystifying and captivating soundtrack."
4,Interesting flow..,"This movie was absolutely amazing, the soundtrack was good as well, yet some may find it quite boring without having seeing the movie. Even then , it is basically just long notes and chords and harmonic things later on. But yeah, its good ! :)"
3,"A very subtle soundtrack, but good.","This soundtrack is very good. It fits the tone of the movie. It has some ""Momento"" vibes to it. If you found the music in the movie enjoyable you will like this CD."
1,Unbelievably dull,"If you want to fall asleep in a hurry, stick the CD on.If you want to hear any proper music, listen to something else."
3,WRONG PICTURE,THE PICTURE SHOWS A 8 POCKET BUT IF YOU ORDER IT YOU GET A DINKY 1 POCKET ITEM. AMAZON WAS GOOD ABOUT TAKING IT BACK AND THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE HOLDER FINALLY ADMITTED THEY HAVE A MISLEADING AD AND THEN LET ME EXCHANGE IT FOT THE ONE PICTURED AT THE SAME PRICE. HOPEFULLY THEY FIXED THE PICTURE TO THE CORRECT ONE.
4,Another FF Scare!,"For another Found Footage movie, this is one of the better ones.It is a shaky cam flick, make no mistake. If you are not a true :Found Footage"" fan, I probably would not recommend that you see it.On the other hand, if you are a watcher of this genre, you must add it to your list of movies.I gave it 4 STARS because I really enjoyed this movie."
2,a swing and a miss,"I gave it two stars because I was feeling generous. It teetered on the edge of being a really great found footage movie. It blew right by the interesting parts, and instead focused on the terrible acting. Not worth it. The ending was a letdown."
5,I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! - FANTASTIC!!!,"This is the best Chic-Lit book that I've read in a long time!I became glued to the characters. Stella and Emily had the kind of friendship that girls WISH that they had with their friends, but hardly ever do. As she did in Losing It, Lindsay Rech, finds vunerable spots in her characters, that you can't help but identify with. I LOVED THIS BOOK!"
5,A Exceptional Ride,"Good story, good characters, good fun and good read. Would recommend this book for a summer beach book or one to sit with in front of the fireplace."
2,"Tall on stories, Short on techniques",I had purchased this book because I was looking for basic techniques on telling short stories. The majority of the book is stories with tips on telling those specific stories. I returned this book within 10 minutes of receiving it in the mail!
4,very cute,"Nice jam jar, very tiny and cute. Smaller than I expected, but it does say it is only about 4 1/2 inches high, including the top. Arrived as promised on time, packing fine, in the lovely damask rose gift box as promised by the vendor, Bears and Other Wonderful Things. This is a lovely size for using with tea for two, or single breakfast trays. Bone China, in case you were wondering. Very happy with this purchase."
1,Steer clear of this bootleg version.,"Showtime will release the fourth season of ""Queer as Folk"" on DVD sometime in February 2005. There is no guarantee as to the quality of this bootleg version. It was probably copied from the Showtime broadcasts. Be patient and wait for the real thing,"
1,illegal copy,Its interesting to note Amazon have removed all the reviews that slammed them for selling this poor quality copy. The real thing will be out soon this just isn't worth the money and really we shouldn't be supporting this sort of thing. Anyway its downloadable free on the web and has been for months.
4,Modern windows with historical connotations,This is The book both for the historian (contains numerous period picture presentations) AND anyone needing inspiration for perfectly stunning window treatments. Nothing for a sleak purse though. This is curtains fit for a king.Could be a little heavier on how-to but gorgeous pictures. This book is a home decoraters daydream. It certainly got me dreaming!
2,Of limited use,"I did not find this book to be very inspirational. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead 1 is because this book would be beneficial to some people. If you like traditional style, like the other reviewers of this book obviously do, this book is probably for you. Everyone else can find other books that give the same level of technical instructions with more range of styles and better photos. The book has a lot of sketches instead of actual photos."
2,For Lovers of Classic Style,"Those who love classic style in design, luxury and LOTS of fabric will find this book truly inspirational. Unfortunately, I am not one of these people. Nevertheless, there is one thing I did like: a very interesting section on the history of curtains.So if you are interested in the history of design, the book is quite informative.On the whole - not bad."
1,Turns hair to straw,"The worst hair coloring product I have ever used. I spent months super conditioning my hair after one use of this product, before I could color my hair again (with a different product). I would not recommend this."
4,Interesting Book,"This book came on time and I always appreciate that. The book itself is intriguing for the students. It's not the straight multiplication, so I use it as a supplement, but not a main learning tool. The students enjoyed the coloring to find the design. It uses multiples as the answer, which can be confusing for those just learning multiplication. I like it and would recommend it if your students know what multiples even are."
2,Only for Huge Fans,"This collection is basically pointless as far as content is concerned. There's only about 15 minutes of worthwhile entertainment on the whole DVD, so I wouldn't say it's worth the money.However, if you are an avid Fullmetal Alchemist fan and this is the only thing your collection is missing, then I would get it just for the sake of having it. I bought it knowing good and well that I was only buying it just to say I have it, but I'm an impulsive buyer and a completionist so it didn't bother me very much.I've watched it maybe twice and it will probably not leave the shelf for a while."
3,"Fun, but lacking...","I'll give it to you straight. There's an ""interactive"" video series that tells you a bunch of stuff about the FMA universe that you already know (that is, if you've seen the show). Then there's a fake wrap party for the movie that is best appreciated by those who've actually seen it. And the last one is a live action segment that's actually kinda lame. It's worth a look, but it's not nearly as good as the show."
3,FMA FAN,"I own the whole FMA series and the movie. I wanted this to complet my set. its not bad, however it did not add anything new to my collection. Its a good time killer for the price. If your a FMA fan get this, if not just watch the movie. It will be time better spent."
1,Perfect Decision in a Perfect Mars,"The whole book attempts to quantify decision making.It failed miserably in the real world. Not only it continued to give out formula after formula, it basically translated subjective opinions into subjective numbers.And the explanation was confusing and had a tendency to say the obvious such as""If your opinions do not agree with the facts, then the facts usually ultimately win out"" (P. 136)The approaches in the book simply add layers of pseudo-scientific sophistication on top of a subjective matter. This book simply illustrates why we should be careful about quantification of a behavioral matter.Avoid at all cost."
2,Funny Smut,"I bought Three Rivers for 5 cents at a garage sale when I was 13. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I still have this book, but only because it's too great to throw out. It's literary porn and darn entertaining at that.When I say great I don't mean Pulitzer Prize winning, I mean humorous, smutty, sex-atleast-once-every-three-pages, over the top ridiculous. If you find this book, good. If you don't, don't sweat it."
5,**REMEMBERANCE**,"The book was very explicit and sensual. A definate Woman's book. I read the book about 15 yrs. ago and never forgot it. Looked for it in numerous book stores but never found it. A very good escape from the daily grind of our lives, to just relax in the bath and go on a delightful journey. Roberta is a very interesting and detailed writer, wish there was more similar books out by her. I plan to re-read it again in Jamaica on my vacation. Thanks Roberta, your book added some fun and enjoyment to my life."
4,Excellent & Unusual,I FINALLY found this book!! It was very difficult to do but was worth my effort. It was very interesting from page 1 to finish!!
3,Rice nothing special,"I bought this rice on the recommendation of the recipe author, but I didn't think it tasted much different from any other type of rice."
3,it more than just a game anime,this show seems like it was as much about if not more about the mental aspects of the game and not watching a group of teens play ball. I actually liked all the psycological aspects they talked about that are inthe game. But the pithcher on the time is so wimpy and shy that it took away alot the fun of the show. Also alot of the charecters looked very simular from one team to the next. To me it was a good one time veiwing show.
3,Not worth the money,"I have yet to find that dog toy that keeps my busy dog busy as it says...my aussie pup took about a minute to remove the treat and another 30 minutes to eat it. I always joke that instead of troubling myself with buying an expensive chew toy or bone, I will just save the gas and give them my $10 bill to eat. It takes about as long to devour these ""lasting"" dog treats!"
1,Just another over priced low performing chew toy,"Was really excited to find the Large Everlasting Treat Ball in a local pet store. We have a labrador puppy and an adult labrador. We purchased two of these products ($50 total). They were awesome for about 90 minutes until the puppy started to eat pieces off the sides of the ""virtually indestructible"" toy. I would never buy this toy again and would not recommend it to anyone. Save your money and buy a pack of tennis balls for under $10. They will last just as long!"
1,Not everlasting--not even close,"Within 15 minutes, Maggie Mousse, my one-year-old labradoodle, consumed the treat and pulled off chunks of the treat ball. Perhaps she was too young for this toy? The blue material though does not seem strong enough to withstand even rather gentle gnawing. I've wasted my money yet again on an ""indestructible"" toy for Miss Mousse."
1,"NOT ""Virtually Indestructible""","We gave these to our labs on Christmas morning. Within half an hour, one of the balls was falling apart - the dogs were able to bite chunks of the blue material off. While the treat discs lasted a little while, the ball was not worth the money... definitely not ""everlasting"" nor ""virtually indestructible"". Very dissapointed."
3,My Lab beat this doggie Rubik's cube !,My 7 month old Lab was able to bite the edges off this ball so the biscuit would come free ...not sure if it's the balls fault ...my Lab is a spaz.
1,Awful smell!,"My dog loved the treats themselves, but wouldn't touch the rubber ball part because of the awful chemical smell it puts out! I finally had to throw the thing away because the smell was making me sick as well.. expensive mistake!"
1,Do Not Buy,"I have a 33 pound 8 month old puppy who loves to chew (50% Pomeranian, 50% Australian Shepard). I sure caught the name ""everlasting"" in this product. I got her one and gave it to her the other day. She ripped it open and ate the treat (which is big) in 12 min, and then started to rip the rubber/plastic. This thing is garbage, any dog will rip right through it. Not only is it not ""everlasting"", it was about the worst lasting chew she has ever had. My advice is do not buy this product, your dog will eat right through it and end up ingesting plastic."
3,Not HOURS of fun,"I have an Old English Bulldogge puppy, and he was able to stay entertained for about an hour. He did pop it out fairly quick cause of the drool factor. It easily popped back in and entertained him for an hour so that made me happy. No treat/toy has lasted this long yet."
4,Good,"I timed my dog with this treat. It took him half an hour to devour the treat. Which stinks. I won't be buying more everlasting treats. I was also a bit upset that it only came with one everlasting treat even though the description says it'll come with two. When I'm paying that much money for a toy I expect to get everything in the description. The only reason I'm giving this four stars is because the actual toy part (the blue thing) has become one of my dog's favorite toys. He has not destroyed it at all even though he does chew on it quite a bit. I stick other toys through the opening and he LOVES trying to get them out. Sticking food inside the ball isn't the best idea because it just falls through the other opening. Overall, I don't regret buying this, but if given the chance I probably wouldn't buy it again."
2,Meh,Only lasted about 45 minutes before chunks of rubber were being ripped off. It has an awful smell as well.
1,failed in the first day.,"our dog was able to take the treat out in less than 2 seconds. and then she tore up the toy in less than a few minutes. in contrast, we have had two kongs that have lasted for the 3 months that we've had our dog and we can put a wide variety of treats in the kong."
2,Not for aggressive chewers,This treat is so very far from everlasting. My 9 month old pup finished it off in fewer than 10 minutes. I will not be buying refils.
2,Not for aggressive chewers,"I bought the medium size ball for my 20 pound beagle, and she had the treat popped out and completely eaten in about an hour. Won't be giving this to her again but I may try to put smaller treats INSIDE the ball..."
3,Duration of treat depends on your dog...,"We have a chow mix who's never occupied for long. I read the reviews on this one and had hoped to keep her busy for an hour or two.She's too smart! Within 10 min she figured out how to wedge the treat out of the ball and crunched it away. Total elapsed time the first time we gave it to her - 15 minutes. Each subsequent time - 5 min.Our other dog can spend up to 30 min on it (if the chow doesn't steal it for herself).We gave some as christmas gifts, and the other dogs took a bit longer (and a chihuahua now loves playing fetch with the empty plastic holder).It's a good product, just realize that the time it will occupy your dog is based on how determined they are to ""kill"" it and get the treat."
3,Great concept - wish it was more durable,"My two Papillons went crazy over these treat balls. The Everlasting Treats that pop into the ball are extremely long lasting; unfortunately the ball itself wasn't as durable as I had hoped it would be. It took only three times of playing with the ball for about a half hour each time for one of my dogs to chew a few chunks off of the ball. Remember, this is a six pound dog; I don't know how long these balls would last with a larger breed. I think the concept is great and the treat portion of the toy is terrific, but I wish that the ball would be made of a more durable material."
4,Can highly recommend,"The ball arrives with an Everlasting Treat covering one end (side) of the treat ball and the other side open. My puppy was not able to get the treats out until I removed the end piece (which is a treat in itself) and now I can throw it to him and he'll play with it for hours! He isn't crazy about the little flavor treats that are made to go inside the ball, and I found that they crumble and get all over everything or get wet and stick inside, so I started filling the ball with cream cheese or little pieces of bologna or chicken and he'll work forever to get them out. His little teeth are needle sharp, but this ball has amazingly withstood the abuse of his constant chewing! Now that he has figured out how to get the treats out, I am going to replace one of the treat ends to present a new challenge. My only complaint is that the ball is hard to clean because there is a groove inside that makes it difficult to clean thoroughly. Regardless, it's well worth that minor problem!"
1,Destroyed,"My dogs destroyed this ball in less than 20 minutes. They chewed on the little flaps, removed the treat, and made the ball useless (it didn't hold the treat anymore). Not that everlasting for strong chewers!"
1,Serious waste of money for aggressive chewers,If you have an aggressive chewer DO NOT BUY THIS. My 18 month old pit mix was able to pop the end out within minutes. I put it back in and gave it to him. within 5 minutes the rug had bits of blue plastic as the holder is very easily chewed.Such a waste of money as that toy is a bit pricey.
3,"Great product, but not for smart dogs!","We bought the large ball for our power-chewing 30lb cattle dog mix, and this product was AWESOME for the first two weeks. She just chewed and chewed and was happy as can be, it kept her occupied for at least an hour each treat... but then she figured out how to pop the treats out (no joke, she wedges her tooth under the edge and just eases them out), now the treats barely last 15 minutes because she just chews a bit and swallows them. They're just too expensive to give her anymore. Luckily you can still shove small bits of dog food into the center, and she still plays with the ball but that game doesn't last very long either. Great product and really durable, as long as your dog doesn't outsmart it!"
4,Everlasting Treats: most flavors not for corn-allergic dogs,"People whose dogs have corn allergies should limit their purchases to the Vanilla Mint and the Wheatfree Veggie-Chicken flavors, which don't contain corn gluten. Without the corn gluten, I'd have given the Everlasting Treat 5 stars."
