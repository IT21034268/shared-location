1,Not worth it,"A little diet and exercise should probably do it. Or, for a lot less money you could get one of those work out videos but this book seems a little expensive for one of those fad diet books.I will not be buying it. I get all the exercise I need sailing my Hobie Cat in the shipping channels around Tampa Bay."
2,Do Not Read While on a Cruise,I decided to read this book while on a cruise. As you can probably guess...It did not end well. On the bright side I am a much better swimmer now.
2,Out of Date,"The so-called huge ships that this book refers to are but babes in the water compared with the HUMONGOUS ones that now ply the seas. So I'm not sure the advice is current, or particularly useful, especially if you are being pursued by one the latest cruise ships or destroyers. (sometimes I can't tell which is which). The usual advice that sometimes works with bears - be very, very still, and maybe they won't see you - only works in ports of call where they are aren't selling overpriced jewelry, which means not at all.I recommend this book for its antiquarian value."
2,is not waterproof,"i was reading this book next to a huge ship and not only did my boat snap in half, but the book got submerged in the ocean. what a useless piece of junk. now ive lost another boat and my book."
3,"Staying Afloat, the words of a trusted mariner.","Trimmer's book brings up many fine points during its unusually colorful descriptions of what I regard as, ""ballast-makers"", those close-calls with...huge ships. He includes the standard wave-your-flag boys attention getting techniques, but goes deeper to include a section on ramming speed."
3,"Disappointed, But Safe","I've been waiting for my ship to come in for years, but now I'll be sure to step aside when the ship hits the fan. Thanks."
2,Slow Going for Teenagers,"I bought this book hoping to keep my teenaged daughter occupied during a long car trip. At first I thought I'd made an astute choice as a glance in the rear view mirror revealed what I thought was the face of a girl totally absorbed in her reading material. A second glance later showed me something more akin to catatonia. After administering a light slap to bring her around, questioning revealed she hadn't gotten further than attempting a 180 degree page turn from page 1 to page 2. It had taken a full 15 minutes and about 20 miles of travel before the page had even started to respond; a full 45 minutes and over 50 miles in distance to fully complete the page maneuver!I'm sure the Captain's book has wonderful lessons in it, but couldn't he make a video (with music) for teenagers?"
2,"Be careful--""Huge"" is subjective","I constantly have to avoid huge ships in my line of work, and haven't always been successful. When I first found this book, I thought it was an absolute life saver. The very week I read it, I managed to avoid both a Chinese container ship AND an aircraft carrier for the first time!! I even managed to avoid a supertanker (barely).My joy at this new guide was sadly cut short, however, when I ran smack into a local cruise ship. I had been following John Trimmer's advice to the letter, so needless to say that I was a bit put out. I tried to find where I went wrong, and found in the appendix that this book only applies to ships of 50,000 tons or larger, while the cruise ship I hit was only 45,000 tons.Buyer beware! Unless he fixes this in the Third Edition, I'm afraid I'm going to have to track down the much less well-written ""How To Avoid Fairly Large Ships"" so all my bases are covered."
4,I'll need to obtain another copy...,"Unfortunately I never got to read more than a couple of pages of this. Had purchased it as something to read on a recent trip. Sadly, once the Engines burned up and there was no electricity, reading would only be available by day...and since the toilets had stopped working, and there was no way to cook food, I'm afraid I used the book for Toilet Paper and Kindling. Now that I'm FINALLY home, I'm thinking that I should have read this before going on my Carnival Cruise."
5,Rocks my life!,"Last year I scored tickets to the playoffs and was having a blast when this HUGE SHIP sat down behind us. It was so foul, it had total potty mouth, and it made inappropriate comments to my bestie, and then it spilled its beer on us. So gross. During the lockout I read this book. Then I scored tickets to opening day, and was not in my seat 5 minutes when a HUGE SHIP went and sat down next to me. But since I had read this book I was totally clued in and I was able to avoid the situation. Score! I would so buy this book again."
5,Excellent companion to round out your collection,"This book was extremely useful, almost as useful as the book, ""how to avoid huge space ships"". a colleague of mine, a Dr. Shaw, read it and it was invaluable to her and her exploits. She found that running away from a rolling ring shaped alien spacecraft in to a direction that the ship was not currently rolling in was an excellent strategy for her with great results. Her employer must not have had the book as she ran in the same direction that the massive alien craft was roll and she unfortunately perished.Worth every penny!"
3,"It's OK if you're just trying to avoid huge ships at sea, but...","The other day, I saw a huge ship fall off a trailer and land on the hood of some poor guy's sedan. Imagine the terror of having a huge ship almost land on you! It really should cover how to avoid huge ships on land, as well. Fortunately, the guy only messed himself; he was otherwise OK, although his sedan was totaled."
1,Saddened by subject matter.,"I was excessively saddened when I picked up this book to find it was only one page long and merely stated ""don't go in the water"" in big bold letters scrawled across the page. I feel as if the book understated the importance of also avoiding large space craft, such as a Klingon Bird of Prey with a cloaking device. Harry Connick Jr. may not have died in Independence Day had he known how to avoid a hostile invading alien species with ships containing a defensive forcefield and laser powered weaponry. The book should really be titled ""How to Avoid Huge Human-built Watercraft""."
2,Needs less useless details and more helpful ones,"I hardly think that the ship's movement is as important as it's lack there of. An entire chapter on wind direction? Are you kidding me? What if there is no wind? What if it is just sitting there like ...an island? The author is obviously just trying to set us up to buy another , if possible, more expensive follow up on How to Avoid Islands . That ship won't sail, I assure you!Also get a kindle version , I had to pay well over the price listed here because your distribution is nonexistent ."
2,Cover is not clear enough,"I really wish the cover had been more explicit about the contents of this book. I thought it was a business book, extolling the virtues of ""just-on-time"" delivery and push-pull manufacturing and distribution. E.g., how to avoid oversize shipments and warehouse overhead. But it was a about boats. Large boats. Not what I expected. But I had to give it at least two stars, because the section on Great Lakes pig iron freighters was captivating."
1,Why no kindle edition?,"Why, oh why isn't this available on Kindle? Who buys books on (shudder) paper anymore? Please Mr. (or Ms.) publisher, release this valuable tome on Kindle ASAP!"
5,PAN PAN - PAN PAN - PAN PAN,Hello all stationsThis is the huge ship bearing down on your location. State your intentions and make all necessary course corrections as needed. This is the huge ship OUT! ;)
1,Too similar to another book,"I bought this treatis and began reading it, much to the delight of my children who have feared huge ships for years and were often too scared to venture out of the house. But, having made it to page 4, I realized that this book, which CLAIMS to be about avoiding huge ships, is actually a carbon copy of a book I read several years ago. It was 1987 and the book was called ""How to Avoid Huge Sharks"".Stay out of the water."
2,Too little too late,"I once got hit by a huge ship in the middle of Puget Sound. No one ever once mentioned shipping lanes. Damn. I sure wish I'd known about this book back then. But even then, it doesn't really explain the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the huge ship capital of the Northwest. So please I beg you! Stay away from the Strait!"
4,It worked for me,"Look, with this book being out of print and going for hundreds of dollars from Amazon sellers, it's out of my price range. But the power of the IDEAS in this book are so strong that merely by reading the reviews and comments about the book here on Amazon, I have been able to avoid huge ships. In fact, I'm no longer even afraid of medium-sized ships. I must admit, however, I still fear being stung by venomous jellyfish, so I hope the author will turn his attention to that oceanic hazard next."
1,Do NOT BUY.,"I have actually been hit MORE since reading and employing the rather complex and ill-conceived strategies related in this book. I have no idea why the author considers himself an expert but, from my personal experience, this book is ABSOLUTELY WRONG on almost every level.A few examples; Do not ""Turn toward the huge ship."" when one is sighted. Do not try to ""save on gas by getting as close as possible to the huge ship and let yourself be carried by it's wake."" Do not ""feel free to stop in the middle of busy shipping lanes, you will be spotted in plenty of time.""For a much better read on the topic I suggest Proust's ""In Search of Lost Time."" It contains no information about avoiding ships, which is better than the information contained in the above catastrophe. Do not buy."
4,PROTECT YOUR CATS NOW!,"this is a must for all cat owners.i have lost over 1,500 cats due to naval accidents.the carnage must stop!learn the step-by-step PROVEN procedures that promote both feline safety and nautical bliss. this book can not only save lives - but also can give you a tax-free residual income for life.you won't be able to put the book down (due to the binding glue overspray on the cover) and you will NOT regret purchasing this.my family, friends and cats thank you for reading this."
2,Huge dissappointment,"I was really excited to read this book. I'm a horror fan and I was recommended this book because I read the Sentinel and many said that this book had the same sort of urban horror feel to it, but that it was better. I really disagree. It starts strong and there are some chilling moments, but the ending was a big let-down and it was hard to make it that far. I mainly just finished the book out of obligation, Contrary to what many may say, I'd recommend something like The Sentinel for a similar feel but much better book, not that The Sentinel is a masterpiece either."
5,Excellent!,"Love these...they're easy to load, easy to shoot and this system of tacking down sheathing or tar paper is a huge time saver."
4,Pictish Guide,"A great little book jam packed with information, excellent for the back pocket and indepensible as a field gude. Would like to see more pictures/photos in the book, though it is a guide and for that purpose it certainly is good!"
2,An axe to grind and adulloe at that,Some interesting historical facts amid refusing to accept some others.Many of the men invoked have no significant link between science and God.hard ot understnd why the author *wants* to believe as he does.
2,Darwin would be Proud,"This book, written by Henry Morris and Chuckie Darwin, gives new perspective of creationism. The science of intelligent design shows the blueprint used by an ""intelligent designer"" to create the universe. Periodically, the creatures designed, both evolved and changed. Monkey may or may not have evolved into man. But various creatures have changed as God planned they would. God can make these plans, because ... well, ... He is God!"
2,blaa blaa blaa,Book with an agenda! While the facts are generally correct the book has an obvious anti scientific agenda. The general message is these men succeeded because they believed in the bible not because they were great scientists. It ignors the facts of the period. To do reasearch you were either independantly weathy or relied on the church (or good christian men) to finance your studies. As such you professed to believe all the church taught. OK lower level readers if enlightend discussion follows.
3,Chitty on Pleading,"Haven't bought it yet, noticed it as being used by Abraham Lincoln in his legal practice."
2,"If you are looking for cheap, buy these!","I work on heavy industrial machinery and the main problem I had with these Allen wrenches is the material is softer than the bolts that I use. The ends of the wrenches, especially the smaller sizes, frequently get rounded off when tightening bolts so I would have to grind off the ends to get a square surface. If you need a heavy duty T-handle, I recommend Eklind products."
4,"Good, but get Ghost Recon instead","This is a very well done game. You are part of an elite HRT (Hostage Rescue Team) and you fight your way through 11 very fun levels. But this game played just like Ghost Recon only this game took me 3 days to beat. On the bright side, the missions are pretty fun and someimes moderetly challenging. One part of this game that really sucks though is that your tam is a bunch of morons. They just wander near you as you are fired on and you cant see anyone but your team can and they just yell ""Taking Fire!"" and dont do anything about it I think the only good thing about your team is that if you die, you become one of them to keep fighting. Good, but I reccomend Ghost Recon for those who want a real challenge."
2,Had lots of potential,"The Sum of All Fears has you leading a group of anti-terrorist experts on a wild goose chase to nail the guy who's supplying all the baddies with arms.This game simply didn't do Tom Clancy's book or the movie justice. There are only 11 simple missions. There isn't even a multiplayer mode!! AuuGGhH!!!The one thing I liked was the true-to-life weapons. Frag grenades, M16s, M4s, and so on.Seriously, though, don't waste time or money on this game. It will only prove to be a bore."
1,Damage of money!,Complete misunderstanding! Movie 12 minutes for 10$ screened one camera amateur it is tightening of client. Level of presentation mister Ackermana is weak!. Damage of money!Piotr Para
2,not heavy duty,"This product is advertised as being a heavy duty paper cutter. It isn't heavy duty, the feet and legs are plastic, the Green Board is actually partical board, the blade on the handle flexes, and the rotating shaft that the blade is attached to is incased in plastic for the bearing surface. This is not a HEAVY DUTY unit.I am very pleased that Amazon refunded the price of the item and the shipping charges without question. They even provided free return shipping."
5,A jewel of a book!,This is one of the most perfect children's book I have ever seen and I have been collecting for 27 years. (day care provider)It is beautifully illustrated with rich diversity. The words are poetic and should be read by every new parent grandparent and caregiver.I think this book should be included in every hospital kit distributed to new parents and use by every literacy program. It should definitely be in your family library.
3,"Interesting, but it didn't communicate with the horse's side",I wish it was a little more understanding about the horses themselves. It didn't tell why they expressed certain behaviors.
1,crayold trace draw projector,"What a total waste of money. I bought this for my 2 1/2 and 5 year old and they never played with it. They tried once, but the picture is so blurry and every time you try and draw, it moves."
1,Not so great.,This toy is flimsy. You really need to have a specially sized piece of paper to use this toy properly and the image does not appear directly on the paper as you would hope. I am sorry I purchased it.
2,Cheap Projector,"My son received this toy six months ago and has used it about 5 times. The pictures are blurry and the paper is not held in place well. I have had to take it apart thinking that it needed new batteries or a lightbulb because of it not working. But, after putting the items back in, it would work again. The toy seems to be a bit sensitive and probably should be improved before selling to children."
2,Huge disapointment!,"We bought this for my daughter in hopes of improving her fine motor skills and we could not have been more disappointed. It falls apart constantly, the pictures are blurry, the light is dim at best and the overall quality is cheap."
5,Really Fun Toy!!!,"My neighbor used to have this toy, and might still have it, and I liked to use as much as possible, as long as she offered it to me!!!! The toy only broke once, and that was because it was used so much, I call it well-loved. The picture came out clear, and you can adjust the size. It has a storage case, where you can put the ""film"", so you never loose it. It's a great toy!!!!"
5,Great Knife,This is a really great knife. My husband and 2 sons love their knives. They are really sharp and are easy to open and close. They also have a great safety feature on them so that they don't close on you when you are using them
1,Poor sound quality,The sound quality on this video is the poorest of any professional video tape that I have experienced. In addition the script is not well written. For such an exciting subject the video provides minimal acion.
2,Not what I expected.,"I was really looking forward to receiving this book, but I was very disappointed when I got it. I am getting married this June and my fiance and I have children from previous marriages. I was looking for a book that would give me different suggestions on a family ceremony that we could include the children in. What I got was a book that has only 7 different ceremony examples and only ONE of them being for a couple with children. And reading that one ceremony does not give you different suggestions. It TELLS you what to have the pastor say, what his prayer should be, what music to play and what passage from the bible should be read. If you're looking for a book that will give you a variety of suggestions to get you started, then this book isn't for you."
4,The Man Who Could Cheat Death / The Skull (Blu-ray),"Both of these Blu-ray films are extremely entertaining, with good scripts, fine cast, and decent production--particularly The Skull. The widescreen pictures are clean and pleasant, which are enhanced for 16:9 TVs."
1,Don't waste your time with this one.,"Non-stick coating failed after only a couple uses. After 8 weeks the spot weld in one of the corners broke. Straight into the recycle bin after that.Consider the Weber stainless steel grill basket instead. No cheap coating to fail, and no spot welds to break either."
4,The Stick Up by ANTHO,"This boy got some lyrics fa ya madd rappin skillz my favoritesHandcuffin Get some money, Do or Die Society.He could have had some better beats but he still wrecks with what he's got."
2,Ghost of Texas Coast,"A Good collection of stories, but a bit boring, I've read 100's of paranormal/ghst/haunting books, and this one just couldnt keep my attention"
3,Warranty is so so,"Product is ok. As a county library we buy them for under $25. Save your receipt, no warranty without it; you will need the warranty to get a new blade. They wear out a lot faster than you might think. Does not self-sharpen, in my opinion."
4,Not enough emphasis on the Jewish role,"This is a good book but there is not enough emphasis on the Jewish role in the rise and spread of multiculturalism.Gottfreid does give a reference of the work of Professor Kevin MacDonald on page 42. This is contrary to the accusation in the review above ""Not for the Literate, January 10, 2003."" The reference is to ""Culture of Critique"" 1998 by MacDonald. The entire chapter on the Jewish role in immigration policy is posted is posted on MacDonald's website which can be found using a search engine.Another discussion of the Jewish role can be found in a review of Gottfreid's book by Sam Francis in The Occidental Quarterly summer 2003 ."
4,Very good basic product,"Nothing special -- this product performs like it should; it is sudsy, it washes well and fits well in your hand and you can easily use both sides of it before dunking it again in the water. Washes out easily."
5,CLEAN AUTO,"WORKS GREAT FOR A GUY LIKE ME LETS GET IT DONE BUT ALSO DOES A GREAT JOB.LIKE : YES DISLIKE: NOYES I RECOMMEND THIS WASH MIT,IT COVERS A LOT OF SPACE AND ALSO WANT SCRATCH YOUR CAR WITH THIS CLEAR COATPAINT YOU NEED A MIT LIKE THIS ONE."
4,"does what it's supposed to do, but ripped","Love this thing. It is so much better then a sponge. Only problem is after first use the wash part started coming detached from the glove part. I thought maybe it was never attached so it could flex, but I washed it and it came off even more and there was a long thread coming off of it. Going to have to hot glue it down some how."
2,Great Microfiber mitt but came RIPPED!,"This is a great, high-quality mitt but it came ripped on the right side!! I am returning it immediately, and I am very disappointed. I used it once and it holds suds and everything. I must have gotten a rare mistake."
2,"Not ""plush"" enough","This is a relatively cheap wash mitt. There is a lot of foam padding, however the actual microfiber content is minimal and not thick or plush. There are many better, higher end microfiber towels available from dedicated detailing stores."
2,Eh,The mitt is okay but too thin.It feels like a thin towel when you use it to wash your car.And the mitt is too big. My hand was moving all over inside of it.Mitt was okay but material wayyyy tooo thin. Needs to be much thicker if it wants to do the job right.Better off getting a microfiber towel or sponge than this.
5,Great wash mitt,"Used this to wash my car and it was a heck of a lot easier than the sponge I had previously been using. I was able to put more of the wash liquid on the car itself and spread it out easily. It was soft enough that it did not leave any marks and easily brought out the best shine. The size was great as well, allowing me to get larger areas in an easier amount of time so that I could wash my car quicker than I have in the past."
4,Quality cleaning mit,"very cost effective, soft mit for your car. It is easy to use and soft on your finish. I use a rougher one on the wheels and rims, but this one is perfect for the finish of your car. Use zymol car wash with it and you'll get a terrific shine."
5,One my Second One,Soft doesn't create or leave scratches. I machine wash mine after a couple uses and it held up for a couple years. The only reason i replaced it is because i got some sort of gummy stuff tangled in the mitt and it wouldn't wash out. Not a fault of the mitt itself. I was two cars usually twice a month if not more in the summertime. I always use this it wrings out fine. Not sure what else to say. I never wear it as a mitt so i can't speak to the fit. It pulls and holds dirt. Solid buy for the price. Way better than a sponge.
5,The wash mitt you've been waiting for,I got sick of using my old wash mitt so I got this new one.All the other reviews are correct - this is a great mitt for the money. It does the trick and now my car is sparkly clean.
5,HIGH QUALITY!,"I purchased this item as a gift, so it hasnt been used yet. However, you can tell that it is an excellent wash mitt. It is very soft & thick. I will definitely purchase this brand again!"
5,Car Wash Mitt,This was the first car wash mitt I have used and it performed very well along with the Mr. Clean Autodry Wash System I also purchased. I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the mitt washed to car instead of using traditional sponges. I am very happy with this purchase and recommend this to others.
5,Soak in lots of soap and feel very soft. GET THEM!,"I have 3 sets of wash mitts right now, a couple I bought from Target, and the Meguiar's Microfiber Wash Mitt.I can tell a significant difference in the mitts. The Meguiar's is much softer and more absorbant... it just feels like more mitt, which is great because I can cover more cleaning area before resoaking it.Cant speak highly enough of these!"
5,Great mitt...,The mitt holds your cleaning mixture very well and just generally does an excellent job. I have begun washing my vehicles using both hands. Why did I not think of this years ago? Order two mitts and you will not be disappointed...
5,this is what you want,This is the mitt you want to use. Personally I use 2 buckets one to rinse the old soap and dirt out of the mitt then dunk it into the clean soapy bucket. Then I use my micro fiber towels to dry. Hint: I ring up my towels ( and mitt) after the washer machine and hang them on a close rack (indoors)to dry. Drying in dryer I don't think is best. Give them a shake when they are dry and you area ready to go.
2,Not so hot...big slobby mitt,"The idea of carressing my beautiful car with a soapy mitt...ahhh. But maybe it should be a glove instead of a big square mit. The thing is heavy and flops around, and the soapy solution runs out fast...needs lotsa dunks. It's OK...but not great. But that's just my opinion."
3,"Almost ""Home""","""Welcome Home or Someplace Like It"" is enjoyable. While not quite a coming of age story, it does expose the young lead to new feelings, new friends, a new town and a new way of life. She is still innocent and perhaps a bit naive, but very sweet and well-meaning. All in all, a cute summer read.I felt as if the end was a little unfinished - as if there was more to the story, more to tell about the interesting town and the tangled family tree. Perhaps there will be a second novel in which we find out more about the father, the cousins, and yes, even the chickens."
3,"Neither rivetting nor compelling, but...","City of Dreams makes such a strong beginning. Accurate history, lively descriptions, winning characters. Unfortunately, the author is unable to sustain this early quality much beyond the first 2 of 8 segments. The center of the narrative degenerates rapidly to the level of soap opera, with plotting and characters that exceed credibility. It also contains numerous errors (e.g., referring to a fireplace crane as a spit). The final chapter, with its focus on the early days of the Revolution, regains some strength. Wish this book contained more information on NYC's growth than on the senseless machinations and silly names of so many of its central figures. It could also have done with less gory medical description - most people already know that amputations and other surgeries were performed without benefit of anaesthetic. Despite these problems, there was enough of interest in the story to make it worth finishing."
5,"Very Entertaining and Colorful, as Well as Educational",I very highly recommend the 1st 3 New York books and when I read the last one I will comment. The books all have many interesting characters and complex relationships. The plots are all absorbing. She is an excellent writer and her books deserve to be classics to be read for centuries.
4,Strong women and a scathingly brutal historical fiction.,I happened upon City of Dreams via book club selection and was riveted from page one having lived in NYC for 13 years. This is a book that I couldn't put down from page one. I loved the savviness of the Turner women and the progress they made for themselves and their families. I was appalled by the medical procedures addressed in the book but came to see how they were a necessary evil in the progress of medicine. I was reminded (and saddened) how much power and greed contributed to the beginnings of this country. The authors passion for the project is evident in her words and in her efforts in making this book a reality.
5,loved it !!!!,"wow this author is so good! i could not put this book down. the perfect book. has love, lust, anger, betrayal and it makes you feel as if you were in the actual story!"
5,Wonderful book about early NYC,"I had just read New York: The Novel by Rutherfurd - I had worked in the city for years inthe downtown area and that book was just wonderful historical/fiction about the early years ofNYC. Then I searched for similar books and found Swerling's trio: City of Dreams, City of Glory,City of God about a family of ""butchers""/surgeons/doctors thru the 17th, 18th and 19th centuriesof NYC. Wonderful experience. I'm going to read Shadowland next. Could not put any of them down.They took over my life for months!"
3,Generations of Dreams,"This book should have been divided into at least three books. Each generation should have its due. There were just too many characters to keep straight. Doctors do see a lot of blood and gore, however I prefer that it be down played in my reading. The slavery in the south and also in the north was terrible. People did mistreat their slaves and you hear or read about these stories. However there were more that had slaves, which was wrong, that treated them well, and even some like family. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
3,Good but not great,"This book is certainly a long read and has a complex mix of characters that and is certainly not aimed at the casual reader.Being a long book is certainly make take some time to get through, although you would be well advised not be reading other novels at the same time, because with so many characters whose lives are intertwined makes it important to pay attention!I thought it well written historical novel, but felt that it does not need to be as long as it is, as the character development and plot slowed near the end."
2,Another one in the minority here,"I am sorry, as much as I love historical fiction, and as much as I LOVEDShadowbrook: A Novel of Love, War, and the Birth of America, I could not get into this book. While I appreciate the amount of research the author did into medical history of this time and treatment of slaves, the gore factor is WAY OVER THE TOP. Page after page after page, compounded with unappealing characters who even if one started to care, disappeared into another generation.I gave up after 200 pages. I give the author kudos for the well done research and keeping with known facts, but as stated before, the gore factor is way over what I can stomach for 600 pages. If you are not sure if this is for you, I suggest you check it our from your local library. Then, if you absolutely love it, buy it. JMHO."
1,Threw in the towel...couldn't stand it!,"Coming from a medical background, I found the description of the graphic operations/procedures uncomfortable but bearable to read. What I couldn't stand were the vulgar descriptions of the character's sexual encounters and the nasty personalities of the characters. I really enjoy historical fiction, but this book just seemed to make every attempt to make the reader wince with disgust or displeasure. I can't remember a time that I ever threw a book away...this book may have been the first...but into the trash can it went. I believe that several reviewers said that it got better as it went on...I don't know...I guess I never got to that point. I couldn't stand to read any further. To each his own, I guess."
5,best read of the year,"I cannot rate this book too highly, I was so gripped by it I took most of a weekend off to read it, even taking it with me to read in the kitchen when I went to make a cup of tea or a meal. It combines fascinating insight into both early New York and early medical practise with a wonderfully 'big' dynastic story. There is plenty of intrigue, passion and action from family murders to pirates to terrifying operations without anaesthetic. It is the perfect book to curl up with and shut out the winter blues, or summer ones come to that."
3,Mythus,"The game has an interesting idea behind it, and I love the setting, but the system itself is a bit pretentious.Still, it beats the hell out of the dumbed-down role-playing games which have been released lately."
5,who wouldn't want a girl like veronica,this girl is gorgeous. who wouldn't want a guitar playing sweetheart that you could nurture and get out of a bad relationship with Philip. damn him to hell for eating her finger and causing her to only have 9 fingers instead of 10.
5,An essential tool,"Great book. The bible in the publishing industry for typesetting style, rules, and layout. I refer to it often and it's never let me down!"
2,Ehh,"I understand the importance of this book, but seriously, we have the internet now. There is nothing in the Chicago Manual of Style that I can't find out on the internet. Mainly people use it for sourcing things that are different from a book or article etc. All of this information can be found elsewhere, namely a book that is smaller than this hunker! Good luck carrying this bad boy around. Good for lifting weights I suppose, will probably save you money on a 10 lb dumbell."
4,Great for first time authors,"This was a great manual for beginning authors. I found it very helpful when I wanted to double check punctuation, spelling, and other topics in general that would help me ""polish up"" the book I was writing. It is well organized and each chapter details what you will find at the beginning. I highly recommend this book for first time authors."
5,One of the best grammar reference books,"This book is a must for all technical writers and editors. Supplement it with a copy of the Microsoft Manual of Style and the latest Webster's Collegiate dictionary, and you'll be ready to go."
4,Religion,The book was an excellent guide to helping me learn to write better papers for college courses.
1,unreliable,"This is a work manufactured by a committee, a committee willing to capitulate to political pressure at the expense of language and logic. If you want to a reference you can rely on, skip this."
4,Complicated,"What can you say about the Chicago Manual of Style? It's supposedly beyond reproach, although I find it incredibly frustrating. I often have a very particular punctuation or grammar question, and I spend hours looking through references and cross-references without ever finding exactly the information I want. I think I'd recommend taking a Chicago Manual of Style course before using the Chicago Manual of Style. I'm thinking of getting the Oxford Guide to Style. I hear it's much more straightforward. Besides, who wants to know that much about book-binding?The Oxford Style Manual"
5,Invaluable compendium for Authors & Editors,"Having completed my first book, my editor kept hasseling me until this purchase was made. I can see now and appreciate his persistence.The usefulness of two specific areas that demanded my attention were met with thoroughness and clarity in this reference: copyright permissions and endnotes. Every single scenario was covered minutely, and provided the style assistance I needed.My only comment to you authors/editors is not wait as long as I did to purchase. Get the hardbound, you'll likely wear the softcover out quickly. This is complete deal for style."
3,"Condensed version of ""The Lost Teachings of Yoga""","This 2 disc set is a condensed version of ""The Lost Teachings of Yoga"", also by Georg Feuerstein. I felt it is worth a 3 rating because it is not as detailed or extensive as compared to ""The Lost Teachings of Yoga"", a 6 disc set. However, it may be perfect for the beginning student of yoga, or for someone pressed for time and looking for an ""executive summary"". Georg Feuerstein presents his wealth of knowledge and thought provoking material in this convenient format, but ""Yoga Wisdom"" is a bit too abbreviated for my preferences."
3,For the price,These are the lowest form of bagpipe you can get. They take quite a bit work to get them fully functioning. (unless that was just mine). They are from Pakistan as well.They're good for beginners as you will learn how to upgrade and fix your own pipes right off the bat. Do a lot of research before you commit to a buy as some pipes require more maintenance than others.
2,only fair,the bagpipes are not of very good quality and it seems as if the set up is backwards because no matter how you hold the bagpipes or on which side you hold them there is always some part of the system that is in the wrong place. there we no instructions to go with the set except for a youtube link for you to go to that is in 2 parts and not very clear visually nor in content. not my best Amazon purchase but as i am deployed right now the mail rules are you open it you own it so sending it back really isnt an option or i would.
2,Chute family,"This book is a dissapointment. There are no page numbers. There is a statement that ""certain even numbered pages are omitted to allow for later expansion."" Which ones are anyone's guess. There are two indexes which are worthless since there are no page numbers. In all fairness, this is a reprint, but it is not done very well."
4,Hard to find item... found it here,I shoot video for our Church. We had a tri-pod but someone had lostthe shoe for the camera.Again hard to find ( I live close to Houston Texas should be able to findanything there) so I looked here. and here it was ...ThanksJohn HenryDayton Texas
2,Pain,I bought this when I was pregnant thinking I really needed this. It turned out to be a bigger pain to have it. Don't bother. Buy more wipes or diapers with the money you save from buying this.
3,Not the best one out there...,We purchased this for our daughter and have been disappointed in it. The wipes are not warm - they are lukewarm at best. In addition the pads need to be replaced too frequently and they dry out quickly. I would not recommend.
1,Try something else.......,"It worked ok. You can't use the pop up slot for the wipes, they get stuck. And I am going to look for a bigger one next time. Our biggest gripe is that it kept shorting out after six months, and now it is kaput!Nothing but cold wipes.I recomend getting one that you can see through. I have been right in the middle of changing a poopy diaper only to realize there are no more wipes left in the box!"
2,Not Sturdy,"This warmer worked really well for a while. It really warmed up the wipes without drying it up. However, they are not sturdy and does not last long. I bought one for my sister - in-law, and hers broke within 6 months - the light did not work, but it did still warm the wipes. Mine died after about 10 months. Not only did the light not work, but it did not warm anymore either."
1,Wipe Warmer,"I registered and received this as a gift. At first I thought it would be a great idea, that was before I used it. The wipes barely get warm, as soon as you take them out they are cold. Another down fall is that the spongelike piece that goes on the bottom of the warmer dries up really fast and in my case it began to burn. The wipes warmer is a complete waste of money and is unsafe."
5,Good for baby,"I didn't think that I needed this item so I didn't bother putting it on my registry but I ended up getting one for my shower. I am glad that I did. My son does not get ""startled"" anymore by cold wipes. It does a good job of keeping the wipes moist. It doesn't brown the wipes unless you are like me and forget to soak the white pad at the bottom of the warmer. The manufacturer recommends checking on the pad frequently in order to avoid browning. I like that fact that you can throw the pad into the wash and it comes out white and clean again. The manufacturer also recommends doing this about every 2 weeks. I also like that you can use two different types of wipes: 1) pop-up 2) standard wipes. I recommend this product especially if you have a baby who hates cold wipes."
2,didn't last very long,"I purchased this wipe warmer after my first one died. The wipes didn't turn brown as they had in my old warmer, but i couldn't get the wipes out after refilling it so I had to open the whole thing for the first few days every time i would refill it. It didn't last a year as my first warmer did. After going through two warmers before my son was 2 I am not too happy with the product but it does make it easier to clean them when they are sensitive to tempurature."
3,It's okay.. Lid won't stay closed..Not impressed,"The wipes warmer is a staple in our house. It's very nice to use a warm wipe - as opposed to a cold, wet one.I'm not thrilled with this ho-hum warmer; but we're still using it. Certain wipes don't work (we use huggies pop-up and they work) and the pop-up lid won't always stay closed. We have to hit it several times to get it to close. It's so frustrating!!And if the wipes fall inside the pop-up window (they can't be out far b/c the lid won't close), then the water spills out when I open the actual lid.And, I have had some brown wipes - if I haven't filled the container (down to about 5 wipes)."
5,A nice (warm) touch,"I received this as a gift and really thought it was absurd. Now, I've gotten spoiled. Having had a winter baby, it was nice to pull a warm wipe out to wash baby's bottom. I almost took it with me when we went on vacation! Like other reviewers mentioned, most wipes don't work with the pop-up feature. But if you were pulling them out of the wipes container you would have to open that too."
5,A must have!,"This is a must for those nights when you need to change your little one and don't want to wake them up with a cold wipe! I keep a bottle of water next to the warmer to remind myself to put some water in it every once in a while. Although I do get more than one wipe out at a time with one hand, I have the same problem with the packages of wipes with the peel back seal! I couldn't live without it!"
2,Save your money,Invest in better quality wipes rather than this wipe warmer. Wipes cool off before you can get them out and put into use. Sponge drys out too quickly and can pose a hazard. We ended up having to rewet ours almost every day. Not worth the hassle. Baby will adjust to wipes from the box in no time.
5,Get this to make baby love being changed,Our son hated the cold wipes they had us use in the hospital so much that I feared that he would always scream when being changed. This all changed when we started using this wipes-warmer at home. He now LOVES being changed! A definate must for all babies! They should get them for the hospital!
3,Not sure how worth it it is...,"So I bought this for my sister for her son because she's been dying for one and he's highly sensitive to the cold wipes. Well, I followed the instructions and plugged it in. Not only did it take FOREVER just to warm up the darn wipes, but it didn't even really warm them and half were still cold. Definitely not sure if it was worth it to buy it."
1,Threw mine away!,"I bought this one as an additional warmer to use with cloth wipes. First of all, you have to tape down the top portion to use for cloth wipes... very classy! I also used it with disposable wipes and had trouble getting them through the top - had to use 2 hands. The fact that you have to keep buying ""pillows"" for this is ridiculous! If you use it without the pillow, your wipes burn and permanently stain (for cloth wipes) on the bottom! I would overlook these things if it performed as I expected, but it doesn't. Get the Munchkin warmer instead - it is the best! None of this hassle!"
1,Do NOT buy will only last for couple of months,"I bought this for my new born 4 months ago after 2 months it has a hard time latching the cover to lock. Now at 4 months it just does not close and lock anymore so it causes the wipes to dry. I really wish I did not throw away the box I would return it in a heartbeat. I tried to contact seller but it does not seem to have any option here. So learn from my mistake, spend that little extra dollar for an item that work and last longer than 4 months."
4,Very Good Warmer,This wipe warmer is definately very good. I noticed that the last 1 or 2 wipes do turn brown but that's no big deal. The only other complaint is that only the pampers wipes work with this and even with them when it gets down to the middle of the pack they stop popping up. Otherwise it definately serves it's purpose.
4,Works Well,This warmer worked well. It did what it was supposed to do. The wipes did not get dried out and turn brown. We live in a desert climate and I was suprised out how well this warmer worked.
3,5 (sorry not 3) stars for something I never thought I'd end up buying,"I never thought I'd end up buying one of these, well I have to say after being peed on many times as soon as the cold wipe hit the bottom, and having my little guy scream in disdain with middle of the night diaper changes I send my hubby out to buy one as a matter of urgency. Well the warm wipes are absolute bliss! I think that they have improved upon the mat that lies on the bottom as we have yet to have a wipe dry out (we use huggies pop ups) and overall using this product has proved an absolute joy for everyone in our household! Even if you just buy one to use on your diaper table and leave cold wipes for out the house and other times, you will really see the improvement in changing a diaper QUICKLY and painlessly. This is a must especially in winter. This item is under warranty as well."
5,Great buy! - A necessity for our baby!!!,We bought this when our son was 6 weeks old and only regret is that we didn't buy it sooner!!! Our son used to cry at diaper changes until we started using the warm wipes.......now he smiles and laughs while on the changing table.
2,Not too excited about his one!,"I purchased this item thinking it would be perfect for those late night diaper changes. I still think wipes warmers are a good idea, just not this one! This warmer heats from the bottom. I quickly noticed the wipes at the bottom were warmer than the ones at the top. I also noticed that the wipes at the top were a bit dried out and soapy feeling. I returned the warmer and found the PERFECT warmer at a TARGET store. The target warmer heats from the top to the bottom, which keeps the top wipes moist and warm, just as they should be. It was a little cheaper in price and it has a lid lock that the other didn't have. All around it is a better purchase!"
3,Works well for non-pop up wipes,"I typically use Huggies wipes because they are thicker and it is fine for that. My daughter likes warm wipes, but doesn't mind cool ones either. But in any case, the wipes stay warm in the warmer and they stay moist. Just remember to soke the liner every week.If you use pop up wipes though, the wipe on top doesn't stay that warm unless you restuff that top wipe back into the main warmer unit.I got this item as a gift and honestly, knowing that my daughter doesn't care all that much whether or not her wipes are warm, I wouldn't buy it for myself."
1,Not really a warmer,"I am so disappointed with this product. First off, it doesn't really warm the wipes. Sure it's not as cold as regular wipes but its like room temperature and not a warm room either. My baby still protest when I use the so call warm wipes but not when I dunk the wipes in warm water and then wipe her. I assume that's how it's suppose to be or how it's suppose to work. Too bad I threw away the box and packaging or this would be going back to amazon for a refund. Save yourself the money and just use a bowl of warm water to warm your wipes."
3,Lid Pops Up,"I got this warmer as a gift. Overall I really like it. The annoying thing about though it is that the lid pops up all of the time. I have resorted to using a small piece of tape on the cover so it will stop popping up. Other than the annoying lid problem, the warmer works well. I use cloth wipes in the warmer."
2,Spend the extra $....,"I bought this thinking that it was a good deal even after reading the reviews. Well...the reviews are right, the flip open lid broke after a month and the wipes aren't really warm. The warmer just takes the edge off. I returned this one and bought the Premium warmer and what a difference!!!! That one actually warms the wipes. Spend the extra $10 and get yourself a wipes warmer that works. Your baby will thank you!"
2,Top Won't Stay Shut,"I love this diaper wipe warmer and it has helped me a lot as a new mom, but one month after I bought it the top quit latching most of the time and pops back up. It drives me crazy! I love everything else about the wipe warmer and how much it has helped me, but the latch just doesn't keep."
3,okay.. but dries wipes out,"keeps wipes warm, but about halfway through a package of wipes,the bottom half gets dried up from the heat and i end up throwing out 1/2 the pack.. going to get the munchkin warmer with water reservoir"
1,Only keeps warm for a second or two,"I bought this because the winter I had my first born the wipes were always so cold and he would have a fit every time I wiped him. I thought these would be great but they are not for me. When I assembled everything and put the wipes in them they were nice and toasty warm I thought ""perfect"" but then I took one out and it took 2 seconds and it was cold, colder than room temperature cold!! I did a test to get one out and put it on my leg and it was like the rapid movement made it colder. I was so disappointed and returned it"
2,Doesn't get wipes as warm as other warmers,"My mom bought this warmer to have at her house when I visit with my son. I thought the warmer got the wipes just barely warmer than room temperature. At home I have the Munchkin warm glow warmer and I think it does a much better job at warming the wipes. I fill it up completely with wipes (I usually use Huggies) and they get really warm and I've never had a problem with them drying out or mildew or any of the problems other reviewers have mentioned. If you have a choice, I'd definitely recommend the Munchkin brand warmer. Oh, and my son doesn't seem to care whether the wipes are warm or not (and he was born in January in Colorado), but I sure do prefer to use the warm wipes!"
4,A wonderful invention!!!!!,"I liked the idea of warm wipes from the moment I'd heard of it. I just couldn't imagine putting a cold wet cloth on my baby's tushy in the dead of winter. Second to an electric bottle warmer, this is much needed and I know she appreciates me using it :-). One downside to this is if you don't keep the sponge fairly moistened with water, it will brown and harden. But overall, this is a really great invention."
3,Good but refill hard to find,"I think this is really great especially in the winter! But trying to find a refill of the sponge that you must assure weekly is moist and replace every 3 months, but I can't find it. I still have time before I gave to change just hope I find it."
2,not so great,I received this item as a gift and truthfully I dont think its worth it. The wipes are cold by the time they hit the babys bottom. Its just another thing to have hanging around the nursery to be plugged in. The latch on the warmer doesnt pop open when pressed and it doesnt close properly. Not worth it!!
2,Unnnecessary and hard to use,"Although the Prince Lionheart Wipes Warmer did get the wipes warm, my newborn who was born mid-winter, didn't seem to notice whether I used warmed or room temp wipes. The pop-top never worked for me meaning that I couldn't pull the wipes through the hole and had to open the top and detach the perforated wipes one by one for each change, which is not easy to do one handed. I tried using the reach-in wipes instead but it didn't help any. Plus, when baby became more active, I didn't feel comfortable using the changing table where the warmer was plugged because she liked to propel herself backwards (beginning at 10 weeks old). Once I couldn't use the changing table anymore, the wipes were never nearby anyway so I put this product away before my daughter was 3 months old. Bottom line - save your money for something worthwhile."
1,RUINS FURNITURE,"The warmer works fine & my son appreciates the warm wipes I'm sure. BUT it ruined my cherry wood changing table!! Be careful what you put it on, the heat from underneath is apparently very damaging(it burned the finish completely off!) & only after I re-read the instructions, way down at the end Prince Lionheart Inc. makes no warranty, blah blah blah that surface discoloration or damage may occur.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
1,Product needs MUCH improvement!,"I would not recommend this product for several reasons:1. The wipes do not pull apart, so you need 2 hands: one to pull the wipe out, the other to break it apart from the wipe underneath.2. The top of mine does not close easily. You have to slam it shut. Sometimes it pops open on its own which dries out the top few wipes.3. It does not keep the wipes warm, it simply takes the chill away so that they aren't freezing cold."
1,Waste of money,It warms the wipes allright...as long as they stay in the container. As soon as you take them out their cold again. Don't spend your money.
2,don't buy this.,"I'll give it 2 stars because it doesn't brown the wipes, exactly as advertised... but, maybe that's because the wipes don't get very warm, at all.Obviously, you don't want them too warm, but they literally are cold by the time the wipe gets to my son's bottom. He still jumps from the cold wipes.I really don't understand why so many ppl gave this thing good reviews. It was a waste of our money."
4,wipes warmer a must!,"I love it. The wipes are just the right temp. My one and only complaint is the ever fresh pad you have to keep buying for it. It says 1 pad lasts 3 months.....not for me they don't. I keep buying more because it just doesn't seem to work as well after a month. Also, they dry up a lot and get yellow quick so you have to stay on top of rinsing it out and re-wetting it. But overall, it isn't that bad. It's quick and not at all time consuming or anything. Also, the new pads come two to a pack and aren't real expensive so no big deal! I recommend the warmer for at least the first few months of baby's life! I still plan on using mine for a little while longer and my baby is 5 months! I will keep for 2nd baby as well!!!!"
1,doesn't really warm the wipes,This wipe warmer is really just a fancy wipe holder. It doesn't really warm the wipes!
1,Pain in the lukewarm (...),This warmer was great for the first 2 weeks. The 3rd week the lid stopped latching. At 4am you don't want to stand there pushing down the lid repeatidly. The 4th week the wipes dried out and turned brown. Wipes are expensive and this thing just wasted a whole pack. It turns out you have to replace the pillow in the bottom (...) I don't want to pay (...) to keep a wipes warmer up to par.
4,I like this warmer,"I've been using this wipe warmer for 4 months and have had no problem. When the wipes are emptied, I rinse out the little pad and leave it very damp and it works fine. I've never had a brown wipe yet. I find that if you keep the wipes as far down into the opening as possible, it keeps them warm for the next use. I use the Berkley and Jensen brand pop up's and they work great mostly because I think they are thinner than the huggies or pampers brand. I do have to keep a hand towel folded underneath just no moisture can get into the wood of the changing station."
4,Extra comfort for baby!,"I like this warmer! True, many wipes won't work with the pop-up feature but I just open the lid and get one ready before removing my little one's diaper. No water spills out. You do have to wet the sponge inside quite often but it's worth it to avoid those cold wipes."
1,No need for warmers,"When I initially confided to my friend about wanting one of these things, she nixed the idea and told me it hadn't worked for her sister when she used it for her baby. Of course I didn't listen to her and bought one. The wipes did turn brown and also dried out towards the end. You don't really need one of these because your baby is more resilient than you think. You're probably better off spending your cash with hooded towels, baby toys and/or baby bottles. Now, our wipes warmer is just sitting in our baby's closet."
4,Great Product,"I have not had any major problems with this wipes warmer. The pop-up top stays shut, there is no major condensation issue, I use Huggies Natural Care pop-up wipes which work great in it, etc. My only complaint is that I wish the wipes would stay warmer longer, as the wipe starts to get cold maybe 5 seconds after pulling it out. It's possible that a wipe that retains its heat longer would initially be too hot on baby's skin -- I don't know. However, a lukewarm or wipe that is a bit cold is better than an extremely cold wipe, especially if you are fast and can use the wipe before it starts to get cold. I think this is a great idea for a product -- you get warmed wipes while the unit runs constantly without bacterial growth (provided you regularly wash and change the pads -- we get them at Target and Wal-Mart)."
1,I hate this warmer,My previous warmer wore out over time and it was replaced with this thing. It doesn't keep all the wipes warm. I can only put a small stack in at a time because if I fill it full the top ones are cold and the bottom ones are warm.
4,Love it!!!,"I had one of these for my 1st. child and I absolutely loved it, so of course I had to have it for my next one. It's just really convenient, especially having two winter babies (one in Nov. and one in Jan.). There's no more feeling bad that you poor lil one has to suffer through his/her diaper change. My daughter loves diaper changes! I feel like it's just one of our many bonding experiences and should not be dreaded. I just wish that I could remember to check that little foamy thing, before the wipes dry out (he he he) : )"
3,wipes not so warm,"The prince lionheart wipe warmer is average. The wipes are no longer cold, but they aren't that warm either. The wipes cool as soon as one is pulled out. It is easy to set up and has a simple open and close feature."
1,Door won't stay closed,The warmer worked okay but the flip top stopped working. I am now back to buying another one on Amazon.
1,not worth a dime,the cover stops working. i had to tape it and pull wipes directly out of the warmer. it did not take long either before it went bad. onl after one month's use
1,LID IS A PAIN,"I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT THE LID POPS MUCH TOO EASILY. NOW I JUST USE WIPES THAT ARE NOT LINKED AND LIFT THE LID. ALSO, THE WIPES ARE COLD ALMOST INSTANTLY SO YOU HAVE TO MOVE VERY FAST TO GET THE EFFECT OF A ""WARM"" WIPE."
2,Not what I expected,The item is of good quality and is definitley an improved version of previous models; however this particular model keeps the wipes so wet that they can be wrung out. This does not work for my newborn as her skin is extremely sensitive and it is recommended by most pediatricians (at least mine) that the wipes should be dryer than wet so that their skin doesn't rash.
5,NO PROBLEM HERE. I LOVE IT!,"I have no problems with the Ultimate Wipes Warmer. There is no browning, no smell, and all the parts work. My baby likes the warmer wipes especially during those middle of the night diaper changes. It also fits perfectly on to the Diaper Depot. I highly recommend this one.Just a 411. You must moisten the sponge at least once a week to prevent drying and browning. Just like anything else on this earth, without proper maintenance, it can break down.Try this one. I'm sure you'll like it too."
1,SAFETY HAZARD Very Disappointing!,"I thought this would be a nice item to keep next to the changing table...however:1. I was told as I was returning this item that the ""foam piece on the bottom turned brown because I was not using the correct wipes""...correct wipes?! These were CHAR marks on this from TOO MUCH HEAT...PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! *This always has to remain plugged in and I did not want this object in my home!2. The warmth of the wipes last about 5 seconds, if that, cold before you even get to use it properly."
1,HAS TO CHANGE PARTS EVERY 3 MONTHS!!! :-(,"I am a Ultra PICKY 1st time mom and after my intensive research, I thought I got what I want... BUT NO. I have to return it.After I got this, I found out I have to replace the bottom linen (comes with it) every 3 months via the manufacturer! I don't like the $$$ to replace AND to keep track of the time (it warns you if you don't do it, it will have germs at the bottom!)Scary!I rather got another one WITHOUT that pad thing which need to be replaced every 90 days. >("
2,Waste of $$$$$$$$$,"I can't wait to return this. Having to use 2 hand to pull out a wipe is not my idea of fun at 2am or anytime as a matter of fact.Will search for another brand.The only plus side is that the wipes due get nice and warm, not to hot...."
3,Not so great,"Not crazy about how the top of the lid keeps popping open, and being so hard to keep shut. Also seems to dry out pretty quickly."
5,Hey What Could be better!!!!,"This was a purchase for the new little man in my life,He is the 1st.for my grandson and his wife.."
1,the lid stopped closing after 5 short months,"The wipe warmer case failed to close after 5 months of normal use. We have to use a paper weight to keep it down. I truly wish that this product is more durable.And on a related topic - the warmer pad:I would like to let you know that it's the second time I noticed mold growth on the pillow. I've owned the warmer for the past 9 months. It's being used as instructed. The current one is not due for replacement till January 4th while I found the mold on December 14th. The pad also turns yellow, slimy and slippery and have a smell after a month. It's very disappointing to have a mold problem with the warmer as it's a product for little babies. Babies could possibly get very sick from this."
3,Warmer is great but with a few problems,"We have both the wipes warmer and the diaper caddy and have noticed that the condensation leaks from the warmer onto the diapers below.The moisture pad must be re-soaked every 2 days or the wipes will dry out. Like the other review states, only Pampers wipes work with the pop up feature. On the plus side, we really like the tempature of the wipes and our baby seems to like it too!"
2,Not a neccesity,"I bought this product because my son was born 10 weeks early. He had a rough begining to his life being hooked up to monitors, fed through a tube, having IV's attached to him, and spending 6 weeks in the hospital. I wanted to spoil him in any way I could. After using the wipe warmer for a few weeks, I ended up returning it. The lid never stayed closed. I had to set something heavy on it to keep it closed. Many times it just wouldn't stay closed and the wipes dried out. I could have exchanged it for another wipe warmer, but decided not to because my son didn't seem to care whether or not the wipes were warm or cold. He didn't fuss with the cold wipes. I did find that that it was much easier to use with the Pampers wipes that pop up instead of the Huggies wipes."
1,Waste of Money,"We purchased this for our son because he would start every time we put a cold wipe on his bottom. Yes, now he has warm wipes, but the negatives far outweigh that one positive:1) The sponge is a pain to saturate. I have to use a whole bottle of water to make sure that it's fully saturated (purified water is expensive enough, but worth it for drinking. Not for warming wipes).2) The lid is a pain to close. I have to pull back that little tab about 4 times before the lid finally snaps shut. Of course, by that time, the wipe isn't warm anymore, so it rather negates the purpose in having the thing.3) The wipes come out 3-4 at a time, and then I have to stuff them back in. What a hassle.4) The wipes are really wet, and slide around on my son's bottom more than they actually wipe. The condensed water makes them too slippery.I'll revert to warming the wipes in my hand first - that's what we do when we're away from home anyway."
2,Unnecessary Item...,"We were really excited about such a cool gadget, but it turned out to be a useless item for a number of reasons. Although the wipe warmer works well and just as described, the few seconds it takes to get the warm and cozy wipe from the warmer to the baby's bottom, the wipe turns cold, which defeats the purpose of having a wipe warmer. The other not so obvious reason we don't have much use for the wipe warmer is because throughout the day I change my son's diapers wherever we may be at the moment, i.e. on the living room couch, in baby room, on the bed in our bedroom, etc; but the wipe warmer must be plugged in to keep the wipes warm and therefore is not really a portable item and can not be where I need it at all times. I give it 2 stars only because it actually works as promised."
2,NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE!,"I recently purchased this wipe warmer to keep my two month old from waking up completely during changes at night. At first it was a life saver,before I bought it I was warming up wipes in my hands, now I realize it was not worth the investment.The lid constantly pops open on it's own so that the wipes keep cooling back off, after you try to shut it several times. The sponge constantly dries out drying out most of my wipes with it, I end up having to wet it on a daily basis. Overall if you don't have a whole bunch of patience and a heavy sleeper(the noise each time you try to close the lid) stick to warming your wipes in your hands before wiping."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Being a new mom I wanted to be prepared and bought just about every item available, out of everything I purchased this turned out to be the biggest waste of money. First you need to have an outlet nearby your changing table to keep it plugged in, second you have to be careful where you place it because of wetness. It now sits in the box in the closet. WASTE OF MONEY!!"
1,Simple changes could make this less awful,"How anyone could give this a positive review I do not know. It doesn't fit a full pack of wipes so the lid won't close all the way when refilled (door ajar). Then the individual wipes door will not stay shut, popping open time and again. This is very frustrating with a squirming kid on the table and a time constraint...The doors pop open, then the wipes dry out, wasting even more money. It's junk. It is nice when it works perfectly, then I like it quite well, warm wipes soothing baby and all, but that's 5% of the time, maybe. I'm so happy I got through this review without using the adult language that remains on the tip of my tongue to describe the Prince Lionheart Model 0231"
2,Probably not for healthy bottoms,"Received this as a gift from a relative at the birth of our son. Truth be told, it works well as a warmer: we used with the washcloths provided and moistened Quickables. The sponge at the bottom keeps everything moist and warm.But our son developed a persistent diaper rash within a week, and after weeks of trying to get it cleared up (thanks, Zinc Oxide and Lotrimin), we decided to stop using the warmer for wipes since it was just a incubator for yeast and bacteria. Going back to (cold) wet wipes, he is now perfectly happy and not a blemish on his bum."
2,Not So Warm,I was not impressed with this wipe warmer. The wipes are really more like room temperature at best. I can not find replacements in stores for the pad in the bottom of the warmer. The pad dries out in less than a week and I end up wasting about an inch of the wipes because they dry out. I wish I would have saved my money.
4,Great Product!!,"This is one of the first things that my husband and I bought for our little one. It makes changing diapers that much easier in the middle of cold nights. I love it and would recommend everyone to get one for their baby as well. The one problem that I have found is it's hard to find the 'pillows' for the warmer. Sometimes you can find them at Toy's R Us, but not always."
3,"It works, but could be better","The first thing I noticed was that it wasn't quite big enough to put all the wipes in at once. It would only hold about 3/4 of the box of Huggies Ultra Gentle wipes and on top of that, wouldn't always pull the next one out or pull out several at one time. You have to pay attention to what you're doing. The other thing that I thought was not designed well is the lid to refill. There is no closing or latching system, so at times when pulling the top lid open to access a wipe, the bottom section pops open with it.However...as a first time baby owner, I thought this was one of those over the top items, but I would recommend a wipes warmer to anyone after using it."
1,Need a lid lock,We have two wiper warmers. Two different makers. Both work fine. One has a lid that locks after you put in the wipes. This one from Prince Lionheart didn't come with one. The lid would open up everytime we tried to pull the wipe out of the warmer which gets very annoying after few tries. We have since taken this one out of service. The other brand is still working for us. Get one with a lid that locks.
3,Just OK - but still using it,We received this as a gift and have found that the smaller feed opening at the top does not stay closed. We actually had to tape it shut and then just use the larger top fill opening. This means that we're always fishing around for a wipe and having to seperate them ourselves.The wipes warmer doesn't really get the wipes hot enough either. By the time it hits the air- 10 seconds later it's cold again since it wasn't hot enough to begin with. Since it was a gift I don't have the receipt to return it but if there was a better alternative on the market I'd skip this one and buy something else.
2,The least useful item!,"We were told that we must buy this item prior to the birth of our first daughter...wish that we had not listened. This product takes up a lot of useful space. The wipes dried out very quickly and you had to replace the ""activator"" pad at the bottom too frequently. I don't know about other parents, but we didn't really have the time or the energy to keep the wipes warmer functioning properly. It takes quite a bit of time and effort. I agree with the other reviews that say that by the time you actually pull the wipes out of the warmer and get ready to use them, the wipes have cooled down to room temperature. Our baby didn't really notice a huge difference. I am sure that this product has been helpful to some, but we felt that it took a lot of work for this product to be effective. Who has any extra time with a newborn? This is a product that our family could certainly live without!"
1,Ridiculous waste of money,"The wipes dry out quickly or are too soggy, there was no in between. Furthermore, this thing is really a gimmick ""you must have this for your child to be a good mother!"" piece of junk. YOur baby won't die of hypothermia if you don't have a wipe warmer. If the thing is that cold, hold it in your hand for a few minutes. Sold mine on ebay. Don't waste your time or money. Put the twenty bucks in your kid's college fund instead. It's a much better investment"
2,silly,"This item is not worth the money. It dries out your wipes very quickly and you have to replace the ""activator"" in the bottom frequently. The wipes don't get that warm and as soon as they reach the air they are cooled to room temp. Just hold the wipes in your hand a few seconds and it does the same thing. It's a waste of space and money. If you are a mom that doesn't change your baby in the same spot every time it is useless. I carry my wipes all over the house. Don't waste your money or the plug space."
1,I hate it.,"If you wet the pad inside even just a little too much, the wipes are dripping wet. Also, the wipes don't stay warm by the time you pull them out and get them on the baby's bottom. It's a waste."
5,Great wipes warmer!,"It warms the wipes well (just remember to keep the pillow moist), and I can do a diaper change without fully waking up my baby (worth every penny!).I use huggies natural care wipes and have never had a problem with them not popping up. I placed it directly on the painted wood surface of my changing table, and have not had any problems with heat discoloration or water damage. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
5,Great warmer!,"This warmer works wonderfully for me, and I haven't seemed to run into any of the problems I read about prior to purchasing it. I've used both huggies and pampers wipes with no problems, and I've had no dry wipes, even when I forget to close the lid, which happens often. Also, if you use the wipes within a reasonable amount of time they do not get cold, you have to use these on your baby so you can't expect them to be hot enough to be able to sit out and stay warm. By the time it gets from the bottom of the changing table to my baby's bottom it's still plenty warm to keep her comfy. I'd definitely suggest this warmer."
1,Does NOT warm wipes,"Not only is this item expensive, it does not warm wipes effectively either. I owned this product and then switched to the ""Munchkin"" wipes warmer. The reason it is expensive is because you cannot use it on it's own; you have to buy Lionheart replacement pillows which are unnecessary. You can pay as much as $12.00 for a pair, which have to be replaced every 3 months. However, the reason why the Lionheart warmer cannot warm properly is because it does not have a seal. Therefore, it does not lock any of the heat and moisture created. On the other hand for example, the Munchkin warmer which I own now, has two locks on each side which seals warm air/moisture. Also, it just requires 1/2 cup of water with each set of wipe addition.Even if the Lionheart warmer was locked, it would still be an OK product since you would still have to purchase the replacement pillows..."
1,Not Quite Right,"This is a great idea, but they didn't design it right. They need to make it work for the Huggies wipes, because the Pampers wipes are thin. The Huggies wipes stay warm until you wipe baby's bottom, but this thing is designed for thinner pop-up wipes. Also, I had a problem with the latch on the top lid. Sometimes all I had to do was gently bump the changing table while restocking with supplies and the lid popped up. More than once we've come home to dried out wipes because for no apparent reason the lid was open. We switched to the DEX wipe warmer. Still designed for the pop-ups, but it has a handy light for night time changes."
1,Love it - but it's not safe.,"I really do love this product. However, after a while of wondering ""where the heck is this water coming from"" I realized what was happening (and that was the last day I used it).What happens is that moisture builds up on the inside of the lid. When you open the lid (the whole thing, not the little pop top) all of that collected moisture streams down the back of the lid and slips out the back and onto the electrical connection. Everyone knows that water and electricity just doesn't mix!You would think they would have put some sort of rubber gasket or something around the edges to stop that from happening.But please, for safety's sake...DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT."
2,it does not warm the wipes,"I tried everything - putting more water, less wipes and the ""warmer"" continues to leave my pampers wipes cold and very wet. Sometimes it will warm the wipes (when I have only two inside). hate the product,"
1,I wanted to love this...,"But it is truly terrible. I didn't even get to use it because the lid does not stay on! It keeps opening and the wipes start to dry out. Pointless, really. Just buy a different one."
1,Do not waste your money,"I have 2 wipe warmers one prince lionheart and one munchkin. The munchkin wins hands down. The LH pop up lid will not stay down, not until I get angry and slam it down. It also burns the bottom wipes since it heats from the bottom, not to meantion taking all the moisture from the wipes causing them to dry up. I wish I would of saved my sanity and took it back from the start."
2,Very Disappointed,"We got this for my almost-two year old who suddenly refused to have his diaper changed with cool wipes. The first day we used it, the top that pops open broke. Very poor design. That said, it does warm the wipes. But it's so annoying to use now that I can't just push the button to have the top pop open. We just have the top resting on it, and it takes two hands. It's ok with our toddler, but I think with a newborn, when you want to have one hand on the baby, this would not be very convenient to use."
3,replacement pillows are not worth the cost overall,"This warmer works well, but requires replacement pillows to keep the wipes moist without drying out. They state to re-wet periodically (which I do almost weekly) and replace every 3 months, but they get old about every 6 weeks and the wipes(especially generic brand wipes) start to dry out. This warmer is one of the higher priced ones and the refill pillows are an added expense. I recommend buying a wipe warmer that heats from the top (these are the only wipes that need to be warm anyhow!) The white and teal munchkin one heats from the top and I have heard it works great."
4,not perfect,"My only complaint (significant) is that the bottom layers of wipes go brown....despite adding water at intervals, I have had to throw away many wipes. The Pampers wipes work best with the dispenser, generic and huggies brand do not."
2,poor customer service,"Although this product keeps wipes warm, it is a pain and almost impossible to get replacement everfresh pillows that go in the bottom of the warmer to keep the wipes from browning. I have been trying in vain for two months to get the replacements from the company. I sent them a check and they have been unable to get the package to my house. When I call they have blamed the post office and their customer service has been unhelpful. Order at your own risk!"
4,Not bad!,"We are a baby wipe using family...they are great for a ton of uses other than baby...and we knew just how cold they can be sometimes. That in mind we decided that a wipe warmer was the least we could do for our little girl. I had been looking around and doing some research when my mom bought us this one. I have to admit that she did really well for it to be an impulse buy. The pop up feature is great and thus far has worked without fail when filled with various brands. The wipes stay moist and we have yet to find any brown edges. We love it and hope that our little girl will too! Also, in response to people not being able to find the replacement pads, our Babies R' US store just started stocking them. The manager said that it was a new store item carried national, which means that most stores should carry them soon."
4,Love it!!!,My 1 month old received this as a Christmas gift from her grandma because she felt so bad changing her with the cold wipes. I love this warmer so much. I have been using it for several weeks and have had no complaints (only wish I could take it with me when I am on the go :) ). So far I have used the huggies wipes and even though you have to lift the lid which is made very well because all the condensation runs right back in the base which keeps the wipes nice and moist. Just be careful because if your out for the day and come home and open the warmer the water does build up and if you open to fast you may get water on your changing table. I am so glad I received this warmer as a gift.
4,wipe warmer,I bought this warmer for my son and I really like the fact that it keeps the wipes from browning and has the antimicrobial feature. The problem is it takes a long time to warm up a new stack of wipes (about 4-6 hrs) and it does require a lot of maintenance (washing and changing the inside pad). The biggest complaint I have is no one carries the replacement pads for the warmer including babies r us. If anyone knows where I can get them please let me know! lwhite2003@optonline.net
4,Warm wipes make a huge difference!,"This warmer is better than most wipe warmers because of the special pad it has in the bottom. Yes, you need to re-wet the pad every so often (about once every 10 days or so), but it keeps the wipes moist and doesn't let all the ones at the bottom dry out like other wipe warmers. My son has no complaints at diaper time when the warm wipes are used."
3,Needs improvement!,"We registered for and received this wipe warmer as a gift with our first child. We liked the product and found that the baby didn't fuss as much with warm wipes as with cold ones while being changed. After a few months, however, the lid refused to stay shut. It got to the point where I would have to put something on top of the lid to keep it closed, otherwise the wipes near the top would dry out. I am now expecting my second child, and while we still use this product, we will have to explore other brands (if there are any who make something similar) or replace the one we have."
3,"Good product, but not great","I will admit I loved this warmer for about the first 6 months we had our son. After that, it just became cumbersome. The pad needs to be moistened every day, and the wipes turn brown by the time you get to the bottom of them. My son is now 1 year old and I can no longer put him on his changing table because his is too big and too mobile, so I change him on the floor. The changing table is where I keep the wipes warmer, so by the time I grab some wipes and change him, they are already cold. This defeats the whole purpose of the warmer, so I simply use it as a ""holder"" now instead of a ""warmer"". My advice would be to just stick with the regular plastic tub style wipes holder. It is much easier in the long run, and will save you some money."
4,The Best One Yet,"We've tried three different wipes warmers and this is the best one yet. We haven't had any brown wipes, they are always moist. Pampers wipes do work better than Huggies wipes because of the way they are packaged- the pampers wipes are folded into each other so when you pull one out it pulls another out. The Huggies don't do this and then you have to open up the compartment each time which is aggravating. Also, you really do have to keep on top of the ""pillow""- it dries out and gets brown and hard pretty quickly, about every 4-5 days I've found so you have to remember to keep rewetting it. The refill pillows are $7 a pack so I try to make them last as long as possible- it's worth it though because there haven't been any brown wipes unlike the other brands I tried. However, I've been diligent about keeping my pillows wet and I haven't had to open a new pack yet- we've been using the same one for three and a half months.Overall, a great product- the best one I've found so far!"
3,Good idea but not all it's cracked up to be,"I loved the idea of this wipes warmer, and in fact, I considered it the one ""luxery item"" on my registry. My son seems to love the warm wipes and will flinch when I use the wipes straight from the container, so yes, warm wipes are better.However, the problem is with the warmer's design. There is a top flap that will not stay closed and the sponge inside dries out, browns (although the sponge's package calls it a non-browning sponge) and cracks!! I even tried to keep the top lid shut with electrical tape and it still pops open!! My son is only 4 weeks old and I have had to replace the sponge which is supposed to last at least 3 months. In addition, the sponge needs to be re-wetted at least twice a week. Very disappointing design, but I will continue to use as long as I can keep re-taping the lid.A word of advice- look at the warmer after each use. If lid is not shut completely, the sponge will dry out very quickly."
3,Nothing Special,"Well, I wasn't impressed w/ this machine. Yeah, it keeps them 'warm' but as soon as you pull out a wipe, within seconds it's back to being cool/room temp. again. By just rubbing a normal wipe briskly between my hands for two seconds, I got the same result. Once I forgot to dampen the cloth for an extra couple days, and it turned brown. I don't like the maintenence that comes with it, I just think it was a waiste of time."
2,Don't Bother,"This item seems like a really great idea....you wouldn't want a cold wipe on your bottom, so why would baby. Unfortunately this product is not worth it, I found that I was constanly re-wetting the warming pad, or replacing it. The pop-top would not stay secured, and the flip top allowed the wiped to dry out, even with the warming pad fresh and wet. My son didn't even notice when I switched to cold wipes out of frustration with the product."
2,maybe we got a bad one,"we bought this warmer based on the good reviews posted here.i have to agree with a previous post that claimed that the wipes dont stay warm very long after being removed from the warmer. if we did not keep the warmer full, the wipes would dry out and we also did notice browning on the bottom few of the stack. again, maybe we got a bad one? if this was suppose to be the best out there, i would hate to see how the worst would compare. we no longer are using this product as our baby doesnt seem to mind wipes right out of the pouch."
1,Poor Design,"Does not warm the upper part of the wipes and the lower part is almost ""Hot"". Can not hold the entire pack of wipe I bought.Stupid pop up never works.My $5 wipe warmer works far better than this one."
5,great for boys,"We love the wipe warmer. It is fantastic when it comes to diaper changes because when little boys get cold you get a shower! The wipes stay warm, not too damp, and not to dry until you get to the bottom layer. Yes we do have to deal with the brown dry wipes at the bottom but we keep the wipes in the plastic bag they come in and we keep that bag in a ziplock bag all placed in the wipe warmer. That keeps them moist, warm, and fewer get browned. This product was worth every penny, and ours is four years old and still working GREAT (it was handed down from sister). The best reason to have this is because it is great for babies. Every time I have to use wipes on the go (without the warmer) my son gives this sad startled face because they are cold on his little tooshie. I know I would hate having to use cold toilet paper."
3,"Great warmer, however, beware of 2 flaws!","This is in general a great warmer as it has an anti-microbial aspect that other wipe warmers do not have. However, this warmer does not work well with Huggies wipes (as other consumers have pointed out) and the latch to close the cover is ALWAYS loose (the manufacturer knows this as well and have indicated this problem in their instruction manual!) The warmer works well with the Costco wipes which we liked better than the Huggies brand anyways :)"
3,Mostly use warm water instead,"After reading reviews for this product that mentioned some people found what seemed to be mold or mildew inside the bottom of the warmer next to the wipes, I decided not to purchase it. I'm glad I didn't. In the winter when it's cold, I would just fill a bowl with warm water and use Kendall Curity Cleaners (purchased from DHP Home Delivery 888-744-7347). This is what they used in the hospital and we liked it. The only trick is you have to get the warm water before you put the baby on the changing table. When it's warmer outside we often use baby wipes right out of the container."
1,"Not as great as the ""old"" version","Between caring for my newborn and a two year old, I have forgotten to add water to the unit on more than one occasion. The pad in the bottom has become hard and burned and I am so afraid about this that I have taken the unit out of the nursery and I am no longer using it. Do any of us need one more thing to remember or one more chore to attend to? I much prefer the older version of this product which was a top down warmer. They are much safer than warmers with the heating element in the bottom. The only down side to a top down warmer is you dont have a pop up system to dispense wipes and they sometimes stick together when you try to remove them from the unit. Still I wish they never changed the design."
4,Love it but.....,I absolutely love this thing. My son is 20 months old and we use it consistantly. We lived in the desert when he was born and they still got cold but with the warmer he would sometimes sleep right through the changes. Now that we live in the mountains where it really gets cold I wouldn't do without it and have to say now that we are expecting again I am glad we have it. The only thing I would have a complaint with is the popup feature. We only use huggies products because of allergy problems and we have to lift the second lid to get to the wipes which isn't a big deal except the first lid always pops up and we have to close it twice. Kinda of irritating but really the slight inconveniece for the use of a pretty good product otherwise. I would recommend it to anyone and have for almost two years.
3,"Not so warm, not so moist","I found that the wipes really are not that warm, especially when the warmer is full and they cool off really quickly so there really is no difference between wipes straight from the package and those from the warmer. I also found that the pop up feature only works with certain brands - the Costco wipes (Kirkland) are great and they will pop-up."
4,Good Wipe Warmer,Its a pretty good wipe warmer. Keeps wipes pretty moist. Also fits on the Prince Lionheart diaper depot. The only real drawbacks are that it doesn't have any way to secure it to the changing table without the diaper depot... and it is a bit bulky.
2,more trouble than it's worth,"I bought this warmer for the obvious reason. Pampers wipees are the only wipes I could get to use also and the moisture pad that is kept in the bottom of the warmer needs constent water. You have to keep a very close eye or it dries up and so do half of your wipes. The pop up lid on mine stopped staying shut about 6 months after using the product, so I have to open the entire lid and when I do so water from condensation does spill out. My son is 10 mo now and I finally unpugged it because I was tired of the water mess and dry moisture pad. We're expecting another baby and I plan on buying a different product."
3,I wish it made the wipes more warmer,"I really needed a wipes warmer .Every diaper change was becoming issue , whenever the wet wipe would touch my baby he would cry , just the coldness of the wipe would irritate , so i went ahead and bought , i have been using it for a couple of weeks now .Its ok , my little one isn't crying as much , but i wish they made the wipes little more warmer . Right out of the warmer , the wet wipe is luke warm , but by the time i take it to the baby , in two seconds , it gets back to being a little cool. Is there another warmer , that is better than this ? would love to know . Thanks"
3,top doesn't stay shut & pillow browns quickly,This is after a 2 year product use (purchased in January 2011). The Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer top doesn't stay shut and the warming pillow browns quickly if you don't keep enough wipes in reserve within the container. Recommend using plastic glue to shut the quick release top and just manually open the whole top when retrieving wipes.
3,"Works, but.....","The product works well, however, after a year the latch has completely stopped closing and the wipes dry out now. We thought it would last longer. Shame it wasn't made to last until we got to the 'potty training phase'."
1,"Worked for a bit, then stopped working! -sending back!","This thing worked for about a month, then it stopped working completely! Shame, I thought I'd finally found a wipes warmer that worked! I've tried the munchkin and had to send that one back to! I recommend just staying away from wipe warmers at all, and warm your babies wipes with warm sink water, none of the wipes warmers I've given a chance have delivered! Buy at own risk!"
2,Prince Lionheart Warmies warmer works better,"We purchased the ""Warmies"" warmer first and loved it. We just weren't a fan of having to pull the wipes apart ourselves. We moved that one into our dining room for warm face wipes after eating and purchased this one for diaper changes.It's awful.The amount of wipe that get's pulled out of the top, is not warmed for the next use. This warmer also doesn't get as warm as the Prince Lionheart Warmies one. We're returning this one and purchasing another warmies"
1,disappionted,"We bought this warmer because we were told how great they were, especially to prevent boys from spraying from the coldness of regular wipes. However, we have been extremely disappointed ever since we plugged it in.First, there is no ""on - off"" switch, so if it's plugged in, it's always on. Second, the wipes are really not kept very warm - if you don't use them in less than a second, they're cold again - eliminating the reason why we bought this in the first place. Third, the wipes aren't dispensing through the top, so we have to lift the entire lid each time - a big inconvenience when you have a squirming baby. Finally, the unit is pretty large, so if you don't have lots of extra space on your changing table, it becomes very cumbersome.In summary, we wish that we hadn't thrown the box away so we could return it."
4,Almost perfect!,"I can't live without this wipes warmer, and it is almost perfect, except for one thing: The pop-up top never stays shut. I had to tape it shut, which means I can no longer use it. I have to lift the lid to get the wipes out. I would still buy it again.....my daughter doesn't need the shock of a cold wipe on her bottom at 3 a.m.!!!"
3,Meh,Warming - warms wipes but they are nearly back to room temp by the time you pull it from dispenser and get it onto baby. We received this as a gift when baby was 2 months old. He was totally used to room temp wipes and had never really fussed about being changed from the beginning.Moisture - fine as long as you rewet pad in bottom every other time you refill dispenserWipe dispensing - not so great: about every 3rd to 4th time a wad of three or four wipes pulls out together rather than individually which never happened when using the cheap dispenser that comes with the wipesI'd suggest not registering for this or spending your own money. Much better things you can use that $20 to buy for baby. We regret not returning it and just buying wipes/diapers/something more useful.
2,Buy a better one,"The lid NEVER stays closed. What's the point in a wipe warmer if the constantly open lid lets all of the heat out? I'm giving it two stars instead of one, though, because it's priced so much lower than others. Since I'll only use it for another couple of months, I suppose I got what I paid for."
4,Gift For friend,"I can't say anything as far as the functionality of the product, since it's for a friend and they're not due for another month, but this item looks really nice! They're really excited about it, it was on their baby registry and their friends who use it say it's great!"
2,no good...... pulls the moisture out of the wipes,I am pretty disappointed in this warmer. I have found that it pulls all the moisture out of the wipes and makes them dry and rough. The moisture from the wipes can be found in the form of water droplets all inside the warmer. So everytime you open the warmer you get water dripping out. The water dripping is a small issue and didn't really bother me. What bothers me the most is that I've only used it about 3 weeks and the wipes are dried out and the bottom ones are brown. yuck. I'll be going back to cold wipes I guess.
1,Wipes don't stay warm,"I would not recommened this warmer. Save your $20.00 and spend it on something else. By the time you take the wipe out and use it on your child (about 10 seconds), it is cold (just as cold as if you didn't have a warmer. Pop-up lid always pops open. Just not worth the money!!!"
4,worth the cost,You don't know how valuable warm wipes are until you don't have any! Our little man really puts up a fuss with the cold wipes right out of the box. I compared this to similar items and am happy I chose this one. It was only a few dollars more but seems to work as well as the other reviews reported. My friend had purchased a different brand and the bottom wipes notoriously get brown and dried out. I would recommend this product.
1,Pop up lid stops working after 3/4 weeks,"Ofcouse this products warms up the wipes but pop ups lid doesn't close after 3/4 weeks. I exchanged one after the lid go bad, second one same problem. I'm using a duck tape to keep it close. If the lid doesn't stay close wipes will dry out."
3,Okay product.,"While my son loves the fact that the wipes are warm when I use them, the stupid lid to the warmer won't stay shut. It is constantly drying out the wipes that are in there and I have to constantly go back and shut the lid. I've even tried putting something on top of the warmer, but that just makes it more difficult for me when I go to change a diaper. I would recommend this warmer if you have plenty of extra time throughout your day to make sure the dang lid stays shut! Also, if you have a money tree you can go pick money off of to replace all the dried up wipes then this is the product for you. Yes, I have been replacing the replacement pillow so it isn't that. Just frustrates me to spend so much money on something that doesn't work properly."
3,It's okay,"Everyone raved about this and said it was a must have. But I could have done without and feel functionally it could be better. FYI- you need to make sure the pad stays wet and dispose of the wipes touching the pad as they tend to smell rank. Also, the wipes aren't that warm, but they aren't room temperature."
4,Functions wonderfully!,"This wipes warmer serves its purpose. It does take a while to warm up, but once the wipes are warm, it stays that way and makes diaper change a lot more comfortable for my baby. I definitely recommend this product! It is a worthwhile investment!"
2,You have to be on your toes or else it will be burnt & dry,"If you are a 1st time mom with a crying baby and you are doing this by yourself and you cant have 10 eyes, this is a waste of money and I am sure glad I did not spend my own money on this but I felt bad for the person who gave it to me as a gift. You really have to be on your toes about it and who has the time, nevertheless; the ENERGY!"
2,Don't Waste your money!,"We used this for a little while, now its a glorified wipe dispenser. It dried out the wipes and we ended up throwing a bunch out. Our son didn't show any sort of preference of warm vs cold wipes. Sure with a baby boy the cold wipes give a greater chance of ""spraying"", but it still happened with the warm wipes. Not to mention now that he is 14 months old he stands up on the changing table and opens the top and pulls all the wipes out of it. I am now just going to start using the plastic container, at least that is harder to get open."
2,Never work for me,"I've read many good reviews about this warmer and decided to buy it. I followed all the instructions, but let me tell you the truth: wipes stay warm in the warmer, as soon as you take a wipe out, it turns cold! Sure, babies like warm wipes, just think that you're out of the house, you have to use cold wipes anyway. It may work for you, but for me, it's a WASTE OF $$$!"
2,Another Wall Wart?,"I returned this wipe warmer to the store when I realized that it uses a wall wart rather than a standard electrical plug. I will probably buy the Especially for Baby warmer, which does not use a wall wart. Do you ever wonder why manufacturers use wall warts? Because it's cheaper to get UL certification for a wall wart than to get certification for the whole device."
1,DO NOT BUY,This product is pointless. New parents will not know any better but it is unnecessary...You will not bring this with you when you travel etc. Your child will be perfectly fine with out.
1,A complete waste!,"This seems so ridiculous to me! Don't you think if your child has to sit in a warm, wet diaper, that a nice cool wipee would feel good on their little bottoms? My daughter never had a problem w/ the cold wipees, in fact they almost seemed to sooth her! This is invention is way too over the top for me to even consider. It is the one gift (along with the diaper genie) that I refuse to buy my friends for their baby gifts!"
1,Terrible,Never get a wipes warmer. They dry out... Just ball it up in your hand for 3 seconds. Most babies don't care if they're cold anyway.
2,"Just not a really ""necessary"" nursery item","OK, I got this at my shower, and I thought it was pretty neat. But I am basically using it as just a glorified wipe box, because it's too much of a pain to do the warming part. There is this cloth that you put in the bottom that you have to make sure is always moist, and you have to keep it moist with bottled or distilled water. So I just throw a package of refills in it and use it just like that, with no warming. It looks really nice in my nursery, nicer than just a refillable box of Pampers wipes or something, but not worth the money to use just like this. I wouldn't have bought it myself, so it was nice to receive it as a shower gift.Plus, I like having my baby used to room temp wipes, because when I go out with her and do diaper changes with room temp wipes, she is used to it and doesn't throw a fit. She didn't like room temp wipes at first, but now she expects them at room temp and doesn't mind diaper changes at all!"
3,Nice to have but not necessary,"I bought this for my little one who had a winter birthday while we were living in a cold climate. I thought that perhaps diaper changes would be a little less traumatic if the wipes weren't so cold. I discovered that it didn't really make a difference and he cried just the same. It did a good job of keeping the wipes warm, but by the time you get to the bottom of the wipes, they were mostly dried out (and ""reconstituting"" dry wipes just isn't the same.) There is a sponge inside the warmer that you need to ensure stays moist all the time that is supposed to help I presume... it just seemed like it wasn't worth the money overall."
3,"Indulgent, yes... worthless, no.","Okay, if you move REALLY FAST, the wipes you pull out of this warmer will still be warm by the time they hit your baby's butt. But usually they're just lukewarm. My baby didn't seem to care, but it did make me feel better that I was doing my best for my new baby. Unless you have a sensitive baby or live in a cold area, this product is all about making parents feel better."
3,Product mom,"Yes, babies loves warm wipes & this warmer does warm the wipes and does not brown. You have to act quickly though or the wipes will cool once it hits babies bottom. Also, the pop-up feature does not work for most wipes. You do have to open up the lid. We found that Costco's Kirkland brand does work for this. Make sure you don't tear the whole package because it won't all fit into the warmer."
1,Don't recommend - Prince Lionhart,"I used this for a few weeks but it doesn't work properly with anything other than Pamper's wipes. The lid opens with the wipe and you wind up having to use two hands - not safe or efficient with a baby on the changing table (A Pain!!). I took it back and got the Wipe Warmer with changing light by DEX and am very happy with it. It has locks on the lid so you can use it with any type of wipe, a night light, a window to see how many wipes remain inside AND there's NO NEED TO BUY SPECIAL FOAM INSERTS EVERY FEW WEEKS. You just add water directly (see instructions.) I wish I bought this the first time!"
4,"Great in many ways, but lid stopped latching","My dad scoffed at the idea of having a wipe warmer, but even he had to agree it made changing our baby a lot nicer. This product was great for just under a year, but now the lid won't latch so we have to set something on top of it to keep it closed. Since the top is curved, we have to balance that thing (currently the hand sanitizer with a burp cloth underneath) very carefully. I plan to write the manufacturer to see if they will help in any way.The only other problem I encounter is that I don't remember often enough to add water to the unit. But that's my issue.UPDATE: I contacted the manufacturer and they are happily sending me a replacement lid."
2,Dried out!,"I was excited about the wipe warmer, until I actually used it. The wipes were barely even warm and the wetting pad that is placed in the bottom dried out very quickly. The box claimed each wet pad would last up to 3 months. Not true. I have been home from the hospital for 3 weeks and have already used 2 wetting pads. When you get to the last 20 wipes or so, they are completely dried out. For a product that had received such high reviews- I am very confused b/c to me this product is defective and unnecessary."

3,Not warm enough,wipes did not seem to be warm enough.room temp at best.maybe thats is what the temp is suposed to be but i think it could be a little warmer and there is not a temp adjustment control
4,Warm Wipes in the Winter are a must!,"This seemed to be just another baby gear gimick at first but turned out to be great for both of our babies. We originally received this in 2005 for our first daughter. She was a small baby and got cold very easily, especially since she was born in the winter. Number two child was a winter baby too. We used this for both and it made changing diapers easier since the wipes were already warm. We used Kirkland brand wipes from Costco. The Costco pack is a little large for the warmer but you can store in the excess in a leftover pampers or huggies wipes plastic container until you need them."
1,Returned it,Purchased this but it was not worth the money. Returned it and did without a warmer. By the time you remove the warm wipe it's cold again when it hits your baby's bottom. Good idea but it cannot be too hot it would burn them so it's sort of a waste.
3,Okay when you have a newborn,"I have a mixed review. I used this product when my son was a newborn for a couple of months. I thought thought that it would be nice not to have to shock his little system with cold wipes in the middle of the night, especially since he was born during the winter. But, keep in mind that warm wipes make lots of little ones (especially boys) pee right away. I ended up having way too many incidents to use them all the time. Also, the pad that's used in the warmer (to keep the wipes warm without drying out) has to be moistened with bottled water every couple of days. I was good about remembering at first, but eventually I would forget and the wipes would dry out. I guess you have to know yourself and if this is the kind of thing you can remember all the time."
3,Wipe Luke-warmer,"Being in a situation where this warmer is not to be used for wipes to be used on a baby, I can say that it doesn't keep the wipes warm enough. They're actually only lukewarm to the touch. Also, when using the dispenser in the top, that wipe is not warm, you have to go past that to get warm ones."
2,Don't waste your money,"What a waste, our newborn hated being changed, so we thought if he had heated wipes he would tolerate it better. However the wipe cooled off within seconds defeating the whole purpose. The pad had to be remiostened too often, and it just cluttered up our changing table."
1,Received broken can't return as it was a gift over 30 days old,"go to target or walmart and buy one instead for about the same price so you can return it if a problem. I bought this as a gift, the new mother found it broken and I can't return it as it has been over 30 days. Live and learn!"
2,Not warm enough to justify buying,This warmer is highly overrated. The wipes don't get any warmer than room temp and they dry out quickly and turn brown. The stay fresh pad turned brown in the first few weeks and needs to be resoaked in water almost every day or it dries out too. Too much work for moms on the go.
1,Waste of Money,"Don't bother, this is the biggest waste of money. I wish now that I did not registered for it."
2,Havent been able to use,I bought this baby wipe warmer in hopes that it was compatible with german housing. Well it wasnt. I should have read more into it. It basically just serves as a very expensive wipes holder. I dont really know how well it warmes up as I haven't been able to use it.
1,Waste of $$$$,I bought this thinking it would be good to have a warm wipe for the baby. What a waste of money! I got rid of it the first week. It's such a hassle. Don't bother. . trust me.
5,Great wipes warmer,This is a great wipes warmer and the wipes do not brown. We have no problem with water spilling when we open the warmer. Our daughter loves having the warm wipes. Just be sure to keep water in the machine as the directions indicate.
3,changing table gets too warm,"I liked this wipes warmer in the beginning. I noticed a little bit of dripping water but my pop-up works fine. The only reason for my negative view is that when I moved the wipes warmer to clean off the changing table, the table was pretty warm in the spot where the warmer had been sitting for the last month. And to add to that the laminate peeled off the changing table from all the heat. I tried putting a towel underneath but it still gets hot and I don't want to ruin my table more. So now every night I unplug it but when my daughters get up in the morning I have to use cold wipes for the first changing."
1,Not Worth the Wipe,"I am sorry to say that this product doesn't do anything but provide extremely wet wipes. The many I faults I found were the following:1) The only wipes that work in the popup dispenser are Pampers.2) The pillow has to be saturated once a week for proper use. If you forget, the pillow and a stack of the bottom wipes dry out and become brown. (It claims the pillow doesn't have to be changed for 3 months...my daughter is going on 4 months and I've gone through 3 pillows only forgetting to saturate twice.)3) The extreme moisture from the wipes requires a washcloth or towel on hand to wipe your baby's bottom after the intial wipe, and4) The wipe is cold by the time it gets to baby's bottom.I wouldn't recommend this product. I gave it one star because it wouldn't let me give it zero."
1,Ruined by Changing Table,"This product ruined by new son's changing table, which would have been converted to his bureau when older. Following the caution I placed it on a mat and was horrified to find that even with the recommended protection layer it still ruined the finish and cracked the wood.The warmer is a great idea and I have enjoyed the comfort it provides. If you purchase this product be sure to by the plastic station caddy that sets it high off the surface. As ugly as it is, it will save your changing table. Frankly, I do not think this product should be sold without it."
3,"Great idea, problem with lid","We received this as a gift for our daughter. We used it nonstop until she was about 8 months old. She did seem to prefer warmed wipes over cold ones. And we never had a problem with brown wipes since we kept the ""pillow"" wet. However, the lid on our unit would constantly pop open by itself. You'd have to spend 2-5 minutes slamming, easing, and reasoning with the darn thing before it would stay shut. Eventually, we kept something on top of the unit to keep it closed.Overall, I would definitely recommend a product like this. But we'll look for a different brand for when our son arrives this February."
3,Nice product,"This is a nice product in that it is really nice to have warm wipes and they do not dry out or turn brown. The negatives with this product are that the pop-up wipes on top can only be used with Pampers and not Huggies wipes. Huggies wipes are assembled differently so you have to lift the lid to get them out which does result in water dripping, at least onto your hand. The other negative is with the pop up wipes, the part of the wipe which is poking through the hole is cold. Sometimes this is half of the wipe. I find that I have to position the wipe so that the warm part actually touches her skin. Not a big deal, but still..."
4,Would recommend,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the huggies wipes will not pop thru. However, this is a wonderful thing for a baby. My son clearly knows the difference in a warm wipey and a cold one. Its something I never really thought about but now that I have one would totally recommend to anyone with a baby especially a new born."
4,Warm and Cozy,"I love this warmer! In the middle of winter, as we are now, this warmer is a God send. It prevents those ""little jerks"" for my poor newborn son when cold air hits his little bottom. I've had this for three weeks and have never had a wipe dry out or turn brown. The previous person was disappointed at ""water loss""? when she has to raise the lid to place the wipe thru the top. I'm not sure where water is coming from, unless she's adding too much to her non-browning pad, but I've never experienced it. I'm hoping this will last for years yet."
2,works but there is waste,I returned it because it dried out the wipes on the top and SOAKED the ones on the bottom - there was too much waste. I now use a travel size one that works GREAT!
2,Extremely... O.K.,"The wipes warmer is a great idea. In theory.But I washed that pad in the washing machine, soaked it with distilled water every time, rotated the wipes, etc. etc. Seems like we all did everything we were supposed to do. And the pad still gets brown and the wipes are dry.The top lid doesn't latch, and that seems to be why the wipes dry out (not because of warming).This product is great for the first few days. You're much better off with the plastic pop-top container you can buy wipes in. Then just warm the wipes in your hands."
4,Find indispensible to have for changing stations,"We thought a wipes warmer was optional, so didn't buy. After our first baby was born, we used cold wipes, and he flinched and cried. Went out and got a wipes warmer by Prince Lionheart, and the flinching and crying stopped at dipaer changes. We use only until this day Pampers Sensative wipes (bought some Huggies - thick, hard, crumbly, and chill down in an instant). Pampers wipes are made differently, and are soft and comfortable for baby. Buy about a half dozen of the wipes warmer pads (Babies R Us carriess), and use one pad at a time at bottom of warmer (should last about 2-3 months). Always add a full cup of water to every batch of wipes you put in warmer, so no brown wipes at bottom. They advertise no brown wipes, but all wipes warmers will brown wipes once the moisture in warmer is at a certain level. Both of our wipes warmers have been going strong for 3 years now."
2,Dries out wipes,"We live in a very cold weather area, and theres nothing worse then having to rub a cold wipe on poor baby in the middle of the night. The wipe warmer made perfect sense...HOWEVER...it dries the wipes out so much that it hardly does the job its intended for--cleaning baby bottoms. We don't use it at all anymore, just deal with cold wipes that clean our daughter. Great idea, needs work."
5,Excellent! Should've purchased a long time ago!,"Wow, we should've purchased this in the beginning, but I had no idea these existed in this quality. We recently decided to switch frome expensive, disposable diaper wipes to cloth with a homemade, organic wipe solution, and this is the perfect container for the little washcloths. The warmer is excellent; just use your wipe within thirty seconds, or it will cool down significantly. I am impressed with the pad that you keep on the bottom of the warmer; it retains the moisture from my homemade solution as well as keeps the pads nice and moist and toasty. Our daughter is really enjoying this; before this we were microwaving several disposables at a time to keep from freezing her little hiney. Would recommend for anyone; disposable or cloth users. Nice for the cloth option, though, because the tub is deep enough and the pad is wonderful."
2,Not very warm....,"I had the Munchkin wipe warmer with my son, but decided to try something different with my second baby. The reviews for the Prince Lioheart warmer seemed great, so I thought I would give it a try. My husband and I did not like it at all. I mean we loved the style of the warmer, but what we didn't like about it was that there is no top warmer as the warmer is strictly on the bottom, therefore the wipes aren't that warm. The Munchkin warmer has a top and bottom warmer, so all your wipes are nice and warm for your baby. Like I said, this is a very nice warmer, but it is just missing a top warmer in my opinion."
4,Far better product than the Dex wipes warmer,"I returned my Dex wipes warmer and have been very happy with this Prince Lionheart model. It takes a bit more maintenance, with the moist pad at the bottom, but in the long run the maintenance pays off. The Dex model is terrible, and severely dries the wipes out while you're pulling out 50 wipes at a time.This model has a more rigid opening so you are only pulling one wipe out at a time. It is intended for pop up style packaged wipes (Pampers). Adding water with each refill will keep the wipes moist and warm. Leaving the lid open accidentally will dry out the wipes.I gave it 4 stars because I would hope for a slightly better drainage design for the condensation in the next model."
2,So-So Wipe Warmer,"I ordered this warmer after using a DEX warmer for the last 2 years. This warmer is so-so. It does not hold as many wipes as my original DEX; it varies with keeping the wipes very moist or sometimes dry by the bottom of the pile and it doesn't seem to lock closed to allow me to pull out the wipes. With these frustrations, it forced me to have my DH open up our DEX and fix the loose wire. We are now back to using the DEX - which we couldn't find anywhere to repurchase."
1,Ditched it after 2 weeks,I found that in order to keep the wipes warm you had to severly saturate the sponge on the bottom. Which in turn would leave your wipes so wet you might as well use a wet towel. The concept works but the design is worthless.
2,Not a necessity!,"As a first time Mom, I thought I definately needed this product, but I was wrong! If you don't keep enough water in the bottom, your wipes will get dried out and turn brown - and who has time to keep it watered! Even if that did work, by the time you get the warm wipe out of the container and to the baby's bottom, it's already cold by the time it gets there. Save your money on this one!"
3,"IT'S A GOOD IDEA, BUT NOT EXACTLY WHAT IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE","We received the wipes warmer as a gift. I was very excited, since I remember the days when we heated wipes in the microwave to warm them! The wipes warmer didn't seem to warm the wipes quite enough, since by the time you wipe the baby, they are already cold! Also, the pad on the bottom MUST stay wet at all times, or else it turns an ugly brown color, which won't wash out in the laundry as indicated in the directions for use. One major problem we had was that when the lid of the warmer is opened, water often trickled down the lid and onto the oak dresser that we used as a changing station. We had to put a cloth diaper under the unit to prevent it from damaging the dresser. It could be better designed. We have continued to use it however, since it is just too inconvenient to use the microwave, and a slightly warm wipe is better than a cold one."
4,Love Prince Lionheart,I gave it a 4 star because I bought the one up from this one about 4 months ago and all of a sudden it stopped working. I bought it in Babies R us in Canada and declined the warranty. (at an additional cost) Low and behold it stopped working. go figure. I came on Amazon and bought the cheaper one and here we have it. Actually it is working much better than the first.
5,One of the few silly items that really is useful,Seems frivilous but really is nice to have. Lasts about a year. Light is very bright on the front so can either double as a night light in the room or can just be annoying while sleeping. My husband covered ours with electrical tape.
4,Works well,It's been 3 weeks now and it's been working well. Not that warm I should say but fits the job....
3,Hard to open for cloth wipes,"We bought this warmer to use with cloth wipes, so I knew we wouldn't be able to use the top pop-up lid. Unfortunately, the main compartment lid snaps shut so tightly that it requires two hands to open, which isn't really practical when trying to change a very squirmy baby. Since I know that alone will drive us crazy very quickly, we're returning it before even turning it on."
4,Wipes come out warm... does the job!,"I only started using the baby wipes warmer during the winter. My baby didn't seem to mind the cold or warm wipes. I think it's more of a peace of mind for me knowing I won't shock my baby with cold wipes in the middle of the night when I'm changing her diaper. Overall, the quality of the product seems to be good and sturdy. The wipes come out warm and seems to do the job. I gave it a 4 star only because it made no big difference to my baby but more for her protective mommy!"
5,great for a newborn,"I used this for both of my kids (16 months apart) and the wipes never dried out. This is great during the newborn phase when it is the middle of the night, they are drowsy and almost asleep but soiled their diaper during feeding and need a diaper change. Nothing wakes up a newborn like a cold wipe and the shriek screams that are amplified in a quiet home once they have awoken. I used this until they started to sleep through the night."
1,I worry about the safety of the warmer,"I received this item off of my registery. After only using it for a week and following the manufacturers directions, I went to rewet the pad. Imagine my surprise to find that the bottom of the pad had been scorched by the heat from this product. I quickly took this product back to Babiesrus and they refunded our money, and asked that I contact the manufacturer and inform them of the problem I had with this item."
2,Not that great...,"Did not keep the wipes warm at all. I didn't think they were any warmer than the temperature of her nursery. You're better off just using a baby wash cloth with warm water or holding the wipe in your hand until it warms a bit. It doesn't turn them brown however and they did stay really moist, so I'll give it 2 stars for that only. Save your $$."
3,It's excellent for the price,"Well, you get what you pay for. I received this item for my baby shower and thought it would be awesome. I ended up wanting to return it, but my baby actually loves how the wipes feel. Needless to say, it's warming feature is useful, but not much else. I haven't had a brown wipe yet, and I do love how you can leave it plugged in 24/7."
1,Big waste of money,"Don't bother with this wipes warmer, it barely warms the wipes and by the time you reach the baby with your barely-warmed wipe, it has cooled off to room temperature anyways. It's a waste of space and cash, don't buy it!"
1,dissatisfied customer,"I am reading these reviews and people are talking about some cloth at the bottom of the warmer. We never had one of them come in ours. We got ours as a shower gift for our daughter. At first I thought this was pretty cool since it would keep everything warm, but once we got 2/3 of the way down all the wipes were dry and turning brown. I wasted more wipes then used them with this warmer. Personally, I would tell you to pass on this product. Use your money for something more useful instead."
2,Wish I hadn't bought it,"At first, our daughter hated cold wipes. She would cry at diaper changes. So my husband and I spent the money for this wipe warmer and thought it would be worth it if it warmed the wipes as advertised. We were very disappointed.The wipes are barely even room temperature, but worse than that, they're wet! Water drips from the warmer when you open the lid. They also smell funny. We never used wipes from the warmer. I figured a cool, fresh wipe from the plastic wipe tub was better than a cool, wet, stinky one from an overpriced wipe warmer. And after a few days, our daughter Riley got used to cool wipes and she no longer complains.My advice: save your money."
1,Useless,"I hate this product. Not only do you have the maintenance of always having to keep the pad wet (trust me, you don't think about that until it has already dried your wipes out), but when it is wet and working, it makes the wipes TOO moist! It's just supposed to warm them, but moisture builds up in it and makes the top wipes way too moist. Now that I have it and it's opened, I'm just using it to hold my wipes, I'm done with plugging it in."
4,Great item....as long as you read direction on maintenance,"I have a 3mth old son...and I love this wipe warmer! Definetly not a ""necessity"" but very nice item to get if you want to pamper your baby. If you read the directions correctly, it says to put at least enough water to cover the cushion pad that it comes with. You have to check it every weekend or so, at least thats when I do it,,,to prevent the wipes from getting dry.Overall....very good item, not a hassle at all..and most of all I love to see my baby happy and not crying when I change him!!"
1,Lid won't stay closed!!!!!,"I would not recommend this product. I also had the problem others have mentioned where the pop up lid doesn't stay shut. I have had to resort to leaving somrthing heavy on top of the warmer so that it doesn't pop up, which looks ridiculous. I also was disapointed that you can't use the pop up feature with Huggies wipes. I received a case of them for a shower gift and have to open the top each time to use. I also don't think the wipes stay that warm. I wouldn't waste my money!!!"
3,"Concept is Good, But Broke Right Out of Box","I debated on getting this gadget as I didn't use one with my daughter as they didn't have them, but thought it might be a nice to have for this baby. I finally broke down and bought one after reading the reviews thinking maybe I'll have a more positive experience. Unfortunately, I didn't have it out of the box for more than a minute when the top pop-up lid wouldn't remain latched. I tried adjusting, but nothing worked. It went back in the box and will be taken back at my next visit. I think I will just warm the wipes the old fashion way - in my hands!"
4,#1 fan!,"I love the wipes warmer! What a life saver for those midnight diaper changes. The warm wipe doesn't waken our newborn like a cold wipe would. I love how it is meant to be ""left on"" all the time. It makes it convenient for frequent use. The only thing I don't like is you have to frequently saturate the pad w/ water. The pad dries out fast."
5,"Funny, Heartwarming Memoir about France","French By Heart is all that a travel memoir should be. Not only does it transport you to France, but it's funny, charming, and reads like a good novel. You won't be able to put it down!This book follows the true story of the Ramsey family, who move from the deep South to the heart of France when the husband is transferred there for work. They even bring their piano and their aging cat!And as you watch them acclimate, you fall in love with the Ramsey family, their quixotic French neighbors, and life in la belle France.If you love travel memoirs or books about France, this is next up on your reading list. It's the best travel memoir I've read in a very long time."
4,a fond favorite,"i owned this book when i was a wee one, and i've since given it away to be enjoyed by other young children. it was always a childhood favorite of mine, one that was simple enough to read to myself, but also with some challenging words (like the uncouth pig from duluth). the pictures are also great, but of course that is to be expected from lobel.i was surprised to see the rather negative reviews this book has received so far, and i do not feel that they are merited. the book may not be as wonderfully whimsical as lobel's frog and toad series, but it does have great charm and humor. the repetitiveness of the short poems is very appealing to young children. this is not a children's book to be enjoyed by all ages; it's a children's book to be enjoyed by children."
3,Personal,"Very good case ,good clip ,well made, good fit ,very secure and easy access. Great orice , well worth it."
4,going golfing,Compehensive unbiased very helpful guide.MAJOR drawback is next to useless listing by state rather than by city or metropolitan area. Who cares about courses in San Francisco if you're vacationing in Palm Springs!
5,Great security item,"I have had this timer for about three years. It has never failed. I really like the random function, where it turns on/off randomly within 15 minutes of the time you set it. It never turns on/off at same time. I am out of town a lot, and installed this for the front door outside light. It turns on and off each night, giving appearance of me being home. The light is on when I get home in the evening, and shuts off after I go to bed. I don't have to worry about forgetting to turn the thing off, and have it running for days."
1,Didn't work for me,I didn't have any dial tone using this cord. I tried with two phones with the same result. The connections weren't loose and no damage to the cord. Both phones work fine with a different shorter cord..
3,A Little Disappointed,"I absolutely love musicals from the 1930s and 1940s so I bought this DVD on faith that there would be something on it that I either hadn't seen before or something that was a clip of a film that wasn't available on VHS or DVD. This is basically a collection of clips from films that have fallen in to public domain and a variety of public domain trailers. It is billed as ""A Musical History"" so you would think that there would be a documentary style structure when, in fact, it is a hodge-podge of clips we (who like this type of film) have seen before. At one point I was considering buying the other volumes but now I doubt it. This would be an okay addition to a public library collection as reference but, if you are a devotee to musicals of this era, I would skip it."
2,A musical history of the 1940s? Oh really?,"How is it even possible to make a musical history from The 1940s without mentioning one of the leading film- and radiostars of that time, Miss Dorothy Lamour???"
5,Not just another Christmas story.,"My friend asked me to read this book, but I was reluctant, because I'm not into horses. I was pleasantly surprised by how I was drawn into the story and how it kept my interest. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the Trilogy with great anticipation!"
2,Erratic Reset,"I purchased this device in April. Now, it is September. The first problem that appeared was its inability to keep accurate time. The clock advances too fast. I first noticed this maybe two months ago. The first couple times there was a difference I would reset/adjust the clock. It kept happening, so I decided to leave it alone for a month and the clock was over 20 minutes off by then. Then the past week, new problems. Now, it resets randomly and enters setup mode. Not sure why, but its in setup mode and the settings/clock is reset in the morning when I ride to work and the evening on the way home. Finally, now the light does not turn off. Arrggh! There is no indication on the device of a weak battery. Seems that device is problematic. I will attempt to get this replaced as it should still be under warranty. I did like the device for all its features in the beginning. Hopefully, it's just my device. Anyway, buyer beware."
3,How about some new songs!?,"BFS is a very talented band. They write catchy, undeniable pop-punk songs that instantly stick in your head. I've seen them live and their shows are among the most entertaining I've ever seen. I've met the guys and they are gracious, fun, and genuinely appreciative of their fan's support. However, I was upset at the unoriginal selection of songs on ""Let's Do it for Johnny"". 5 of the first seven songs have been on one of their two previous albums, and Belgium now appears on all three! Maybe the people at Jive told them what to put on the album, but their songs are so much fun to listen to that I wish there were more new ones. I hope they don't get lost in the shuffle with the tons of other pop punk bands out there that all sound the same. (Blink 182, SR71, Riddlin' Kids, Green Day, etc.) They deserve recognition on a national scale."
3,Good songs lousy sound quality,"I have a lot of these songs on MP3 128kb and liked them enough to purchase the entire CDI enjoy their quarky humor and fun lyrics with driving guitar, bass, drums and rhythm.BFS is a true pop punk band and the songs are a must own for BFS fansThe problem with the CD is the sound quality and production is very disappointingI bought the CD because I thought the MP3 128kb sampling rate was the reason for the poor sound quality but to my dismay it is the original recording"
3,an okay CD,"This CD is a great CD. Well, it was when it came out in 2000. I purchased this CD after buying the Drunk Enough To Dance CD (2002) and the songs just aren't as cool as the music we have nowadays. But if you're caught in the 90's then you need this CD. I really love this CD but after hearing Drunk Enough To Dance, it's not as good."
5,The best doggy bag!,"I love these bags. They are sturdy, easy to use and can even be reopened and reused (without a mess!) in the event that your dog decides to do his business twice on a walk. I have tried others and always go back to these. Now I'm done trying others!"
5,Pick up with less mess,"Best bag I have used by far. Easy to turn inside out and tie a knot without making a mess of it, and the plastic is thick enough that you don't really feel the poo texture through it. You don't feel like you have to immediately wash your hands after using. Does a better job at containing odor than cheaper bags. Large enough that I can pick up a couple messes from my 60 lb. dog with one bag. Highly recommended.PS Never use grocery bags, they always have holes. At least use a produce bag, bread bag, or a Subway bag."
5,I love mutt mitts.,"I like the double layer of plastic between your hands and the poo. Very helpful. Also, you can use these as portable drinking bowls on trips, etc. Handy."
5,Ideal product,"Not only are they well-constructed, they are biodegradable. Your (and your dog's) chance to feel self-righteous and be green :)"
5,easy to use,"it is very easy to use, and the double layering on the bottom makes it extra easy for those who are apprehensive of picking up dog poop. biodegradable too."
4,Support The Up and Coming!!,"A great new book by one of my favorite authors. This girl is going to be famous one day.Her first published collection, Marie's Book of Spells, wasn't really to my taste but this is exactly the sort of thing I like to see. A peek into the mind of an American youth through poems and journal entires. Always honest and vastly entertaining. I'm eagerly waiting to see what she comes out with next."
2,High School Sophomoric,"Got this book because back in the mid-1960s my high school homeroom class at Baltimore City College High School selected Fillmore as the nation's most forgettable president. Found it mildly amusing at first, but then it wore out its slight welcome. Didn't merit being added to my library, so I passed it on to a former classmate."
1,Don't waste your money,"As noted by others, this is not a work of biography. Despite what others have said, I don't believe that it is a work of humor either.Unless you find it in the 99 cent remainder bin, save your money"
2,Presidential Biographies,"I am trying to read biographies/autobiographies of the presidents in order. This book was a waste of time. Although the author has some fact, it was difficult to distinguish tounge in cheek from fact. I would encourage the author to become gainfully employed."
1,Oh well....,"Based on the cover, it appears that the book will be a comic but historically accurate biography of the Dan Quayle of the 19th Century. I expected to learn and be entertained with humor. Unfortunately, one is never certain whether the author is presenting information about Fillmore or just joking about him. It all leads to confusion. The reader can't take any of it seriously, as one doesn't know if he's joking or educating. Also somewhat disturbing is the ""humor"" really isn't particularly funny. This may be again because the reader can't always tell when information is being fabricated. I wanted to like this one but just couldn't."
1,A sophomoric insult to real biographers and historians,"This book is neither fish nor fowl: neither a real biography (it should be catalogued, shelved and marketed as ""Humor"" and not as Biography) nor particularly funny satire. It's really more of a sophomoric mocking of biographers and historians who conduct actual research and write compelling stories of people's lives. It's just not funny, but rather silly in a way-too-full-of-himself way. Do not waste your money."
1,"Hard to tell where the ""joke"" is","As we learned with the author's poorly researched last book, he is not above making things up when it suits his theory or whim. Here, he makes the whole book up in a misguided effort to be amusing in an effete drawing room style. The truth is that the entire book would amount to a three minute Saturday Night Live sketch or maybe two pages in MAD magazine. I really don't know why you would bother with this book."
5,hilarious,"This book is hilarious! The first page or two I was thinking this is going back up for sale on Amazon. Not now. I'll be re-reading this book. It is hilarious. It is hard to describe in just a small space, but from Fillmore's survival at the Alamo, duel with Andrew Jackson, thwarting an assassination attempt on Jackson, friendship with Edgar Allen Poe, his search for the source of the Nile. It is one amazingly funny episode after the next, all written in a straightforward style, not tongue in cheek. Even the index is funny."
1,"It one of, if not thee, stupidest books that I have ever read.","About one-half to three-quarters of the way through the book, my doubts were confirmed. That is, the author was blending B.S. with some reality. I have been chronologically reading a biography of each president; I wanted serious truth. I am wondering if the author, George Pendle, was trying to mimic a Forrest Gump type of character in hopes that a movie producer might pick it up, and produce a movie on it?Unless a person likes to read stupid books, my advice is to stay far removed from this p.o.s.Sincerely,Scarback"
5,Nice Folksy Sound,"Nice sounding, easy playing tremolo harp. Took about an hour to get used to the wide hole spacing, compared to a standard 10 hole. Worth the effort. I'm just a hobbyist, who plays for fun. I wanted to try something different, and feel that this was money well spent. Any of the folk/gospel tunes sound nice and rich. You can play any harmonica tabs on the web, you just use the number system stamped on the cover plates. Instead of 1 to 10, you have 2 to 9, so any tabs that contain the range between those numbers works fine. BTW the harmonica is tuned ok , as I check against a digital tuner. For the price of a cd, you can make your own music and have fun."
4,good harp,"I'll agree w the review before that this is probably better for kids. I bought it for a 3yo.the center is plastic which was disappointing, but reflects the cheap price tag. this is also wider then a standard harmonica."
4,More CD Johnson,"If you like Carolyn Dan Johnson, you'll like this CD. It wasn't, IMO, quite as good as Dress Rehearsal, but it is good."
5,Your Madness Not Mine,"A fun read. Having been to Cameroon and searching for fiction to bring on a return trip, I found this book entertaining and quite an appropriate representation of Cameroonians' life experiences."
4,Good product for removing crosote,Use this product as directed and the creosote turns to flakes that will be easily removed.
4,"Easy to follow, well-planned","An excellent introduction to balance ball workouts, and the book provides good instruction on proper techniques. Neither Jennifer Pohlman nor Rodney Searle are ""show-offs"" with regard to their range of motion or ability level (for a comparative example, see ""The Method Pilates - Target Specifics"" starring Jennifer Kries.)All in all, a well-rounded (no pun intended) program."
2,size malfunction,the size of these boots are way off... i wear a seven and my calves are fairly normal but these boots felt two sizes too small amd i couldnt even zip them
5,Great Boot for wide feet,"I love these boots! I already owned them in red, so I decided to get them in black as well. I wear a men's 13, so I got the boot in size 16 (cause they do run about a size smaller) and fit comfortably!!! I was able to wear them out for one whole night without any problems or pain. The one con is that they can get scuffed at the pointed toe very easily and if you're legs/calves aren't big enough they can slouch/fall down off your leg. Other than that, a good boot!!! I'm going to get them in more colors..."
2,Still to small,"not true to size, need to order 1 size larger. the color of the boot was ok and the quality was ok"
4,Nice looking boot,"Sexy and, according to my wife, surprisingly comfortable. It does run 1 to 1-1/2 sizes small, as others have mentioned."
1,Overpriced,Great show and would be well worth the price if it wasn't less than 1/4 this price on other sites. Try looking at Funimation's online store and you will see.
3,"For those looking for combat detail, forget it.",While I enjoyed the book I cannot totally endorse it. If you are looking for a book that focuses on what the Japanese High Command on Okinawa was thinking and doing this is the book. What this book is not is a detailed description of the fighting from the Japanese infantry soldier's perspective.
3,A View from the Japanese Side,"While not a full account of the battle, it gives some insight from the Japanese perspective. Drawn primarily from interrogation reports, the author helps Yahara explain to his countrymen and the world how and why he survived a battle that most of his troops did not. Troops who while digging cave fortifications felt in one soldier's words ""as if we were digging our own graves"". It helps fill in some of the gaps in the historical account of THE largest, the most savage, most forgotten and most protracted battle in the Pacific war. One whose 54,000 American, 100,000 Japanese and 200,000 Okinawan casualties makes all other better known Pacific battles pale in comparison."
3,Safe for protecting your filters,This filter wallet protects my filters in a full camera bag. It folds flat and is easy to fold up but keeps my expensive filters protected but close when needed.
3,Needs updating,"Filters are expensive.I haven't dropped one out of this wallet...but its been close.A backcheck flap to sewn on the underside of each pocket would keep the filters under control when trying to pull one loose without losing the rest. I would like a Label or window for one on the outside. Or a color differentiator so that its easy to tell which ""Black"" wallet contains what without opening them to find out and exposing the filters inside to dust.The vast majority of photography gear is Black as are the bag and interior liners of said bags...things that go in those black bags need to be a different color so you can find what your looking for even in bad light."
4,Works Alright,This is not the best filter wallet in the world but it does the job. It is fairly large for how many filters it holds and it does not fold well when it is full of filters. Other than that it will defanately fit all your filters for a low price.
5,Fan/limit control_Honeywell 4064B2236,"After a bit of browsing the web I found that this was the replacement for my obsoleted fan/limit switch. It turns out the only difference was the addition of a manual fan control. Other than that, it was completely identical. Installation and adjustment was pretty easy. I got a great deal at Amazon. My local supply house wanted about twice what I paid (around $60). Just a word of caution, if you have a low voltage control be sure to remove the link (see instructions)!"
5,High quality controller,"Easy to install- and got my 1967 furnace back on line in no time. Comes with wiring pig tails and good instructions from any furnace, past or current tech."
3,"Clean, no problems.","No problems with the part. A little opaque with the early shipping details, but good overall."
4,Achva Pistachio Halva,"Great flavor and texture of the vanilla Halva itself, but the Pistachios do not permeate well enough to enhance the flavor throughout. It's only when you bite into one that you get the blending, so maybe adding more of the nuts would help, or some natural flavorings."
5,"Fresh, cheap and deliciuos!","A really great deal and it holds up real well in the freezer, with a taste that can't be beat!"
3,poor quality pastchio nuts mixed in the halva from Israel,"The pastachio mixed in the halva are either rotten, old, or burnt. Last week I notified the company in Israel via e-mail and told them same. No answer yet. As you will note from my account we bought two cases, but dissappointed with poor quality nuts used. We love halva and unless things improve we will stop ordering same. I always believe ""Good quality products always brings good profits"". The converse of which leads to business demise!."
1,Getting Out: when the time comes,This was not worth the money I spent on it. It turned out to be only a couple of pages of very general information that was not specific to the topic. Very disappointing!
1,Poor Quality Forks,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT. POOR QUALITY AND NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT! I PUCHASED THIS PRODUCT AND WITHIN ONE HOUR OF USE THE FORKS BROKE. I SHIPPED THEM BACK TO COMPANY AND HAVE NO LUCK GETTING REFUND. CAUTION STAY AWAY!
2,Nice bag but doesn't work nicely,"This product has a design flaw. The strap of the bag is at the lower part of the bag, when wearing it, the bag is tilted outwardly (away from your body), making it very uncomfortable to wear for longer than 2 mins! I would definitley not recommend this bag to anyone. I would love to keep it, it is nicely made, but am returning it today...will pay more for a more comfortable one."
5,Well made,Great size waist pack with 2 plastic bottles. It has a spot for your phone/mp3 player that you can listen to music through earbud. Very well made!
5,A Book for Any Thinking Feminist,It's about time someone dealt with this subject. Feminists interested in the experience of teenage girls will find Tanenbaum's book essential. Highly recommended.
4,A subject that needs discussing,I found the book to be very interesting and she backed up the narratives with studies. The saddest thing is such a double standard exists.I especailly though the refences in the index were very helpful and would empower and assist other girls that are tormented by false rumors and violence.
2,not what i thought,"i didnt think i was going to be learning things about sluts, i bought the book because i thought it was going to be a story of a girl who was promiscuous and how she delt with it. not a bunch of stories from different times."
1,How People That Are Not Sluts They SomeTimes Act That Way,I can not see how some people act that way knowing people is going to think they are and then tell them. Then they get mad i dont know why they act that way.Then they would be ready to fight the person and when they fight she say the person started it and tha is not right at all.
3,ANOTHER compilation,"Lois Bujold is an AMAZING writer! Set me down with one of her stories and I'll ignore most all of my responsibilities to continue reading until it ends! So far I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every book or story she has written. So... when I saw the new book, Miles, Mystery and Mayhem, I immediately pre-ordered it from Amazon, thinking, ""Great! The next installment in the Miles Vorkosigan series!""Well, it arrived last Friday so I dropped everything (there go those responsibilities!) and opened my new book. Cetaganda? Ethan of Athos? This isn't new! It's another compilation book!I was depressed all day Saturday.Anyway, for those of you who missed some of Ms. Bujold's earlier works in the Vorkosigan universe, get this book! For the rest of us, well, we're still waiting......"
2,Compilation of not-terribly-thrilling older works,"This book is a republication of Bujold's Cetaganda, Ethan of Athos, and the short story ""Labyrinth."" Unfortunately, Cetaganda and Ethan of Athos aren't her best works, lacking the brilliant humor found in most of her other novels. Labyrinth is a good short story, but is also available in Borders of Infinity, an exiting short story collection."
1,"Yet another ""omnibus"" rip-off","I am a voracious fan of fantasy and science fiction, so when a new title by an author as good as Ms. Bujold shows up, I snap it off of the shelf like a shark, only to find out: It ISN'T a new title! What is the deal with the new trend of re-publishing books under a new title? What was wrong with the old one? This book is a blatant attempt by the publisher to squeeze more money from what is otherwise an excellent series of books! Buy the original books!"
3,I like his new stuff better,"I stumbled onto Robin Horlock when I heard his song ""Sink"" you can see the video on youtube. So I did some research and found this cd. The cd is good but average. Not much really stands out. The hot track ""Missing You"""
4,Sales Slump Doctor,"In contrast to the many ""Dare to be Great"" books written for people in sales, Dr. Greenfield's book provides a practical handbook for assessing one's sales performance and how to make changes to improve your performance. I intend to make this book mandatory reading for my entire sales staff. I think that the techniques outlined in the book would be benefitial to everyone not just sales people frustrated by that slump. Thanks Dr. Greenfield, good job."
4,Andis Clippers,I was able to do an adequate overall clipping of my Shih Tzu with this product. I feel that the product is of better than average quality.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I GOT A BETTER SET OF CLIPPER, THE DIFFERENCE WAS ASTONISHING AND WISHED I HAD SPENT A LITTLE MORE!"
5,The best...,Luden's cough drops - the Original - are no longer sold in my neck of the woods. These are the best cough drops in the world. Sorry world! Thanks to Ludens and thanks Amazon!
1,bait and switch,"Dear Amazon,this purchase was a bait and switch item. the Ludens Original Menthol Cough drops were switched to Ludens Cool Menthol. different ingredients, different taste. They sent me a return label. I returned the product.They never credited my Amex acct. I am very disappointed as I reported this to amazon and no action was taken by amazon. Terry Fink"
5,Perfect for the iPad [Edited],"I was able to connect this to theApple iPad Camera Connection Kit - iPad accessory kit - Apple iPadand transfer photos onto the iPad directly from the memory stick. I simply love the fact that I was able to do that!Edit: Ignore this review. This used to be possible on the original iPad with iOS 3.x, but Apple has since disabled this feature via their operating system updates as well by hardware updates on the iPad 2."
5,Excellent step-by-step guide on how to do anything outdoors.,"It's springtime and time to fix-up the house. One of my projects is to repair some brick and mortar that joins my flower beds with my driveway. I'm clueless on how to work with this stuff but I'm at the Home Depot looking for supplies and information which is where I find this book. It's set up in twelve sections: Fences and Gates, Landscaping Walls, Decks, Patios, Sheds, Walks and Steps, Trellises and Arbors, Garden Beds and Edging, Furniture, Electrical, Plumbing and Drainage, and Concrete. It's complete with a skill scale (so you can figure out if you even want to try to tackle this project), safety alerts, estimated time (based on experience), tells you all the tools required and all the stuff you'll need. It's absolutely complete and extremely well laid out with pictures galore. A ""must have"" book for the weekend warrior."
4,nice book!!,"This book truly gives you the most ""bang for your buck"". If you are interested in learning how to do a wide variety of things and are somewhat mechanically inclined.....THIS is the book for you! I have my own contracting business and refer to this book many times for that ""extra"" insight I need on a project. The diagrams and pictures are very helpful and I truly would recommend this book to anyone!"
4,Writing in book,"Bought this book for my husband; didn't say it had writing on the inner cover, that couldn't be removed. Husband liked the content, but seller didn't state that it had writing in it. Good price for a used book, but not suitable for a gift."
4,love this book,this book is great my husband wanted it and now he loves it he uses it all the time and it give us both ideas on things we can do and then shows us how.
5,"Warner Video will release the ""For Those About to Rock: Monsters in Moscow"" on DVD!","Warner Video will release the ""For Those About to Rock: Monsters in Moscow"" on DVD for the first time on June, 5 in the UK.

4,G8030 Router,"I attempted to purchase from Grizzly direct and got a delivery date of 3 months out here on the east coast; no stock. Purchased via Amazon and it shipped from West coast and got it within 10 days! Exactly what I expected for the dollars paid out. Obvious,but worth stating, most important to fully understand manual prior to running, operating pneumatic head, raising and lowering of head must be done with spindle turning, router running, or belt will not slide on spindle and interfere with housing! 3 HP motor is low HP but sufficient for our use..like most high end Taiwanese tools fundamentals are there but....once again, you get what you pay for...Guard design is actually good..lifting the unit onto the stand needs to be planned..."
2,Uncle Miltons 3-D Journey under the Sea,"I already had the 3-D machine with the solar system slide show/CD in it and loved it. While some of the images were not totally wonderful, the idea was really cool and the CD tour was really educational for my students. However, the 3-D under the sea tour was very disappointing. The tour is not nearly as engaging and none of the pictures appeared to be 3-dimensional. I probably will use the CD and find my own pictures to project to go along with it."
5,"Very nice, good story line, multiple studios","I really enjoyed this DVD. Many of the clips came from trailers, but there was a good developmental story line. The images were clean; the sound solid. There were a number of acters and others from the time period providing brief interviews. There was material from a number of studios. Many of the film clips I had never seen before. I wish many things -- longer film clips, longer interviews, etc, but all in all this was a reasonable effort."
3,Norton is good but a memory hog,"Systemworks Premiere 2007 does what it always has done well - but, it's bigger than ever and uses up a ton of memory and processing power. The trade-off for me is that I have always used Norton products and I think its Windows system tools are among the best."
1,Annoying to use,"Systemworks continues to grow, taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer, and I'm likely to buy an alternative next time I update. Note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer - a new hard drive, motherboard, or processor and Symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy. I like the basic functions, but there's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore."
1,D.O.A.,"No wonder I couldn't find the '07 VISTA version at Sam's Club... or Walmart... or Best Buy! This appears to be bogus. Too bad, I have had Norton as my primary protection for 15 years. Guess they were bought by a company from China that substituted lead for silicone in their workstations."
1,USELESS WITH VISTA,"NSW 2007 (or 2006) premiere is useless when it comes to VISTA...and considering it comes pre-packaged with EVERY PC known to man (desktop or laptop) this is unforgiveable.Norton AV has an update but that is a far cry from the ~$100 price of SystemWorks that MUST be uninstalled according to MS VISTA.MAYBE with the 2008 versionTruth be known, System works has saved my aZZ a number of time since the 2003 version but now it is useless!"
4,"great book, especially the cases...","great little book this one. provides a definitive overview of the consulting industry. it is not biased in any way - so it highlights the pitfalls of the profession, as well as its perks. i think the best part is probably the case frameworks and the 100 sample cases. it has the 10 different types of cases you could expect, and then provides a worked answer in dialogue format - which makes it particularly helpful if you want to practice cases with a friend. all in all, a great guide - thoroughly recommended."
2,If only we could put the tree back in the forest...,"This book is dedicated to general job seeking and interviewing techniques applicable to any employment situation. The chapter on consulting models and case questions is decent, but the remaining 200+ pages are irrelevant drivel that sheds little light on the inside machinations of a consulting firm, consulting positions, duties, expectations, and daily life. After spending a couple of hours reading this book, I feel no more prepared to approach leading firms for interviews than before I picked this title up."
3,Average; better books out there,"As a graduating MBA student, I found this book to be only average. There are more useful guides out there on careers in management consulting including: The Vault Reports Management Consulting Guide,"" ""Dangerous Company,"" and the Vault Reports Guide to Case Interviews."
3,useful,"This is a useful guide, though can be a bit simplistic at times. Still, it is worth reading, particularly if you are very new to the industry. Also recommended for consulting careers are the Vault Guide to the Case Interview and the Vault Guide to the Top 50 Consulting Firms."
2,Boring and generic,"I just spent several hours in the local bookstore looking at consulting books and this one was a real yawner. The case interviews might be fine, but the generic statements about a consultants life covered all of 3 pages. There is lots more from my experience with a high tech management firm."
2,Not very good; there are better guides available,"In my opinion, this book was not worth my time to read it or my money to buy it. There was very little in depth information on the consulting industry. As superior guides to consulting, I would recommend the Vault Guide to the Top 50 Consulting Firms and the Vault Guide to the Case Interview. (The latter two can apparently be downloaded directly from vault.com if needed immediately)"
5,Excellent Preparation for Consulting Interviews,"I've read them all - Wet Feet, Vault, HBS, Naficy - and this book is the one that helped me the most. Naficy is anecdotal and dated at this point; HBS is written for Harvard students and contains recruiter info that pertains only to them; Wet Feet is just superficial; and although Vault has some useful content, Management Consulting has all of the same info plus much much more. Don't bother with the others - just get this book."
4,"Very Informative, Good Summary","I thought that this book provided a very good summary of the management consulting industry, and what kinds of things I needed to look for and questions that I needed to ask to make sure that I was targetting the right kind of firms for me. It also provided a pretty good summary of a number of different frameworks - great if you need a bit of a refresher. There were even some frameworks that I had not learned that the book taught me about. It does not go into an in depth description of the frameworks, but the summaries are pretty good, even if you have not learned about the frameworks before.The book provides a number of different examples of cases, but only provides possible solutions for a few. That is my only disappointment with the book - I wish it provided a few more possible solutions to some of the problems. Other than that I found it very informative.I would say that it is more targetted towards someone coming out of school or looking for a career change."
3,Disappointing,"I was excited to get this DVD since I saw the movie. May be that is the problem. After the movie, this ""biography was disapponting the best."
4,Almost No Tribble At All,"My first model kit of this type. For $9.99 I have to say its definitely worth it and very accurate to the Constitution-class vessel. The bridge section is a teardrop shape, not the round shape like the AMT Constellation. A lot of people have problems with the warp nacelles. A good solution is this: the nacelle pylons are two-piece; build this piece first and then assemble the warp nacelles. I think it rather unusual to show a picture of the assembled model with these crooked nacelles in the instructions but who knows why its a minor error at best. Also, the registry for the Exeter in this kit (without cutting and arranging) is NCC-1672 not following the registry given in Franz Joseph's technical manual."
2,Not good,"The product came out a little too small. When the product arrived at my house, I never got the English instructions."
1,Defective starboard nacelle design,"I recently bought two Polar Lights Star Trek Enterprise model kits, from two separate sellers, and both have the same flaw, the starboard nacelle will not attach properly!If it had happened to just one model I would think it was just a fluke, but when I had the exact same problem with a second model, then I knew it was an overall defect with that model design.This is the newer, Round2, version of the Polar Lights Star Trek Enterprise model. I have no idea if the original Polar Lights model had the same defect, or not.As it is, I cannot recommend this Polar Lights model to anyone. I will stick with the larger AMT version of the Star Trek U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 model, with glue required. The glue-together models are more fun anyway.MACJR"
1,Not worth the tree that was killed to print this book.,"I was so disappointed. Richard usually writes thrillers, but this one wasn't. It was just bad. If he had condensed it into a short story at dinner, and paid, I might have enjoyed it. Maybe super-environmentalist-hippie-types will love it, but not me. I tried to read it on vacation. Boring. I left it at the hotel. (Marriott, Grand Cayman if you want to go get it.)"
1,How to make a fascinating subject unreadable,"My book club read this book based upon a suggestion from someone who had heard about it but not read it. While the subject was fascinating, and the book began somewhat promisingly, by the time I reached the halfway mark I knew that I couldn't finish it. This so-called narrative non-fiction was nearly impossible to follow as Preston jumped from one unappealing person to the next without tying together an apparent story line. But, worst of all, the writing wasn't very good. Interestingly enough, the book club critique was unilaterally poor, and most members, like me, chose not to finish it. When one member mentioned that her 7th grader had read the book as part of the school curriculum, it made sense, because the writing style made the book more appropriate for Middle School readers than adults."
2,Needs a Ruthless Edit,"This book could easily have been edited in half, so much of it was irrelevant fluff. Yes there was a story to be told, but it was padded out with the prosaic details of it's subjects personal lives. Why would we want to know their golf handicaps, or what they have for breakfast? These people are interesting for the exceptional things they do, and where some context in their wider experiences would have added power and meaning to the story, Preston simply over does this, and actually weakens the story.The writing style is painfully uneconomical. Condensing the narrative, and increasing the complexity of its sentence structure would intensify the reading experience.I believe the science described in this book. I think it's important and it interests me, but there just wasn't enough of it."
4,"Yes, there really is passion and daring","In case the title sounds like hyperbole, in the parlance of the tall-tree botanists who are the protagonists of this book, a ""wild tree"" is one whose canopy has never been explored.That said, this was a masterpiece of nonfiction, a genuine page turner for those who appreciate scientific research and preservation of nature's wonders.I took off one star because it's a tome that begs for more illustrations and diagrams than are included, but that's the only fault I could find with ""The Wild Trees.""By the way, if you think that this book might tell you how to view these marvels, give up hope. Their locations are very closely-guarded secrets except for the few that have previously been marked in the national-park guidebooks, and that's exactly as it should be. As it turns out, even if you had the coordinates for your GPS device, getting to them would be extremely arduous and definitely not for the average nature lover."
5,Redwoods On High,"Mr. Preston has made a career from writing thrillers about killer diseases (The Hot Zone -- 1994; The Demon in the Freezer -- 2002; The Cobra Event -- 1997). In ""The Wild Trees"", the author shifts direction and writes about the the Redwoods trees of California (hence the title). While not the thriller like his earlier books, it is interesting about a little known topic. The heart of the book is about the lives of the eccentric scientists who climb the Redwoods for exploration. It is a good read on a cool spring night."
5,"A quick read, vividly told","The first tale of Steve Sillett and Marwood Harriss freeclimbing a redwood to the top made my tummy clench in a vicarious fear of heights. Preston is particularly good at making the experience of climbing immediate and real. He also pulls together the various people who have interacted with these trees and tells their stories. But central to the book is the place of these millennium-old trees. He notes that the ecology of the canopy is one of great biodiversity, but one that becomes more diverse as the whole grove ages, and thus a tree of only 500 years hasn't had a chance to accumulate the full complement of lichens, and ferns, and even epiphytic bushes and trees that a true old-growth forest accumulates. This is a window on time as much as the volume of previously unexplored habitat. But the stories of leaping from tree to tree are still scary. Do you see the two climbers pictured on the cover? I didn't for weeks."
4,trees & more,A book truly about finding one's passion and calling. Who said that there was nothing left to explore for our generation? Highly recommended.
2,Skip this one,"Unless you really really really love botany and tree climbing, I'd skip this one. Instead I recommend 'The Golden Spruce: A True Story of Myth, Madness, and Greed' by John Vaillant."
4,Secrets of the Redwood canopies,"This book was a complete surprise to me--I had always enjoyed the Sequoia stands in the national and state parks of California but I was always at the bottom looking up but not able to see very far up into the tree. If you are interested in nature, trees, wildlife, camping, hiking or discovery in general, you will love this book. I learned so much from the methods by which the professionals climb these trees, swing from one tree to another, sleep in the trees, and best of all, all the growing miracles that thrive in the redwood canopies.I cannot recommend it enough--I was fascinated."
3,Redundant,"The subject was fascinating, but I found almost identical lines repeated throughout the book. More time on the editor's desk needed."
4,The Wild Trees,"The author provides an intriguing view into the subjects of botany and wilderness, and the eccentric people who study them. He does an excellent job of supplying the reader with just enough scientific information, to make this a didactic text instead of a just another biography of adventures; leaving me a little more knowledgeable, as opposed to feeling like an armchair adventurer. Not only does the author literally follow Steve Stillet, Michael Taylor, and Marie Antoine on their adventures into the Giant Redwoods on the west coast, but we also get a glimpse into botanical academia. Preston's active role in the research of his subjects offers a unique look into an undiscovered world. He leaves little to the imagination with his ability to describe complicated tree climbing maneuvers, and explain intricate biological subjects and terminology."
5,You think you know trees?,"Interesting book and written in a way that makes it hard to put down. Character, history, tree info - all entertwined to make a fascinating book. I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed spending time with this book and even discovering a new 'world' in the trees."
4,Good Book,"I am not a reader, but this book did it for me. Once I started I could not wait to read further."
4,Exploring a New World From Your Easy Chair,"Reading this book was an enjoyment because I got to go on a vacation without leaving my chair. It has stimulated me to explore interests far away from my known expertise, and discover interesting things I never knew about myself."
2,Editing is Lacking an otherwise impressive story idea,Loved the content but found the style of writing to be better suited to essays. This booked seems like it was rushed to print before Preston had come up with a suitable way to tell this story. When it gets to the part where he is involved directly with the characters it is more coherent but the chapters that tell the story of each character is better as a stand alone essay. It just seems like a book that is half baked....not crazy...just not ready. Where was the editor?
3,More trees needed,"This book focused too much on the tree climbers and not enough on the trees. I have mostly enjoyed some of the personal touches Preston has put into his other books. I have read Demon in the Freezer and The Hot Zone and those at times had a little too much back story but The Wild Trees needed more meat relating to the trees or just less about the explorers he details. The information about the trees was interesting but it came with too much wading through personal drama. I would give it a 2.5 but will opt for three as it was not a bad read, but overall I would not recommend it."
5,An unexpected gift,"This was included when my dear friend Sarah sent me a copy of The Splendor of a Thousand Suns, my having loved The Kite Runner. Hah! I hated Splendor and wept with joy over The Wild Trees. About to buy it for a friend, I saw there were only two reviews. I LOVE - absolutely, LOVE -- this book. I'll never give it away.It's dear, funny, exhaulting, scary, sad, educational... and having been in Muir Woods, well... the idea that Sequoia and Redwood have been so destroyed is more than I care to talk about and when I do, I begin to cry. Then there are the Douglas firs in Australia and that's a whole other ballgame.Buy this book!"
1,itty bitty bag of peppercorns for $10,I definitely don't recommend buying these for the price. You can order them through the manufacturer for $4.00 or get a much larger container for a few dollars more with free shipping. I didn't realize 2oz was such a small quantity. What a shame.
2,Straight from the sop,"Man, does this guy love himself or what... Practically runs a national airline to the ground and alienates thousands of employees by trying to convert his company into a flying Wal-Mart, and still manages to write a self-masturbatory book that pathetically tries to make himself look like a misunderstood genius, an angel struggling against the forces of darkness in the airline industry. What's next, Mr Milton, a statue of yourself in downtown Toronto? Sheesh! The only point in buying this ""book"" (and I use the term loosely) is maybe to prop up that wobbly kitchen table of yours."
1,no nudity....,"There's no nudity in this film. One short appearance by one girl that I saw. I admit I looked away frerquently so if anyone else saw nudity, please advise...."
3,Warcraft III Expansion review,"I decided to get the expansion. Once again, it had a great story mode just like the first one (Warcraft 3). The gameplay of the Campaign can get very repetetive, however. But it's an RTS. The Multiplayer/Battle.net community is nill on patience and kindness, depending on what game you join of course. It's all about winning and being pro for some people. Really annoying. Still fun to be had though if you look around and still a good purchase."
5,THIS GAME RULES!,"Warcraft III:The Frozen Throne, is the best game Blizzard has come out with yet...from the new heroes, to the little changes that makes this game great, everyone who knows the Warcraft line should buy it!"
3,Bought it to play DotA.,I loved the original warcraft and dislike change. The new races and changes didn't interest me. Bought this to play the custom game called Defense of the Ancients with friends.
1,"Terrible Vendor, Great Game","NO CD IN THE CASE. NO CD KEY FOUND. NO RESPONSE ON REFUND FOR 2 MONTHS, HAD TO FILE CREDIT CARD REPORT THEN THEY FINALLY REFUNDED.How am I supposed to make out of unbroken seal on the box with NO CD INSIDE?! I don't know, I don't trust this vendor. I bought this off from another place to play the game. And the game is excellent. I'm not so sure how to rate this game here because ... I want to give five stars for how fun it is and how much I like it, but I don't want to give five stars to the vendor."
1,"Bad expansion, bad! Sit down!",A crummy storyline with practically nothing new makes for a worthless expansion pack.
4,the beast at this game beassssssssst,Warcraft is my favorite computer game. It has a lot of fun especially when you kill your allies. I'm level 100 because I play every minute of my life except for now and when I'm at school. When I play nobody messes with me. I'm the best person you could find on the game except for my brother. You should definitely buy this game.
3,Best Game Just Got Better!!!,WARCRAFT 3 is the best stratagy game ever!!!! W3 FROZEN THRONE is ever better with NEW UNITS NEW BUILT SHOPS NEW ITEMS AND NEW MAPS!!! The reason i gave this game 3 stars is because IT missed some stuff it SHOULD OF made in the expansionBLIZZARD SHOULD MAKE THE 2 NEW RACES NAGA (SEA CREATURES) AND DRENEI (OLD SLUG LOOKING MEN WITH BLADES) in skirmish maps and also the Grapgics did not change another problem is that you cant use battleships or warboats in Skirmish maps you can only use transpot ships.DOWNLOAD NEW MAPS AND UNITS BY GOING TO WWW.BLIZZARD.COM
5,The Frozen Throne,"This game is a sweet game. If you like magic and roleplaying this is a must buy for you. Going on BNET and playing custom game is so much fun, my favorite game right now would be StayOffTheGrass. If you dont wanna play custom games go and do a BNET game and try to level up. If you like to talk to your friends a lotand you have a lot of friends on WC3 you can make a clan, clan are for people who like to Arranged Team a lot. So if you don't have this game I would recommend it. This game is for everyone, and if you by this before Reign Of Chaos your gonna need to get Reign Of Chaos before you can start playing because The Frozen Throne is an expansion set."
5,Warcraft III: Frozen Throne Review,"Warcraft III isnt like any other PC game that you would find on the streets. It is a game that includes a lot of fantasy, myth and Legend. It is a fighting game where you have to build an a rmy with one race to destroy another race that you are against. There are quite a few campaign levels. This game is good because its graffic's level is very high. Along with its 3 Dimensional effects it produces extra effects such as realistic mist and dust. If you are looking for a fantasy fighting game, I would recommend Warcraft III the frozen throne or Warcraft III reign of chaos. because frozen throne is an expansion pack you will need reign of chaos to run it."
5,OMG this game rocks,I'm a beta tester for the new expansion and i think this game rocks! All the new characters and each having one new hero per race is pretty cool.U will have to throw away ur old strats because in the new version they are useless.
5,Warcraft III:Frozen Throne,WoW! What a game. This game is worth every penny you spend on the game. Play Warcraft 3 and you will have to buy the Expanison Pack.
5,Best Game Ever,"To put it lightly, most gamers could live off this game. It is the most amazing game ever to appear on the computer! The grapics are amazing, online play is supereb, and overall, i rate this game 15 out of 10!"
5,SuperIncrediblyGreat!!!,Blizzard has outdone themselves again. Actually its not realy an expansion its almost a whole new game the grafics are beutiful I personally i think Naga are the best. this game includes:.9 new heros one new for each race and five neutral..32 new story/campaine modeand even more but i dont want to spoil the fun.If you liked diablo and starcraft youl like this game.long story short its frigg'n awsom
5,Wonderful.,"Warcraft III was amazing, and TFT only improves it. As written elsewhere in these reviews, the gameplay is improved dramatically (both in single and multiplayer terms), the new heroes (especially the Ranger with Fan of Knives and Charm) are a lot of fun, and the storyline leaves you begging for more. And, as always, Blizzard keeps its wonderful sense of humor. (""And this one time, at Bandit Camp..."") Hee hee."
4,"Although it is great, it requires more improvement.","At the first time, I do not hope with any Blizzard too much, as I faced from Starcraft-Broodwar expansion pack.Although the story is good, I have many comments of this expansion :-- The story is too short compared to the original version.- Very bad improvement in Custom game, I can not choose new races to play, even I can in the scenario game. ??- The additional map is too few.- There are NO additional rpg maps. (Although it had in the original version). All I had to do is find out in the web, and downloaded manually.Blizzard, please consider my comments. I hope your next expansion will be better."
5,Loved the movie - and loved having the soundtrack!,You don't have to know a stitch about golf to find this music hauntingly beautiful!!
2,"Old, but not really classic","These are NOT cartoons you want to buy your kids becaue they'll undoubtably hate them as they were made from 1928-'33 nor are you likely to if, like me, you love classic cartoons. These aren't classic so much as just old. You'll probably only enjoy them if you study or plan to study animation. The shorts on this disc are:Happy PoloSummertimeThe Iron ManThe Haunted Ship (Waffles & Don)Noah Knew His ArkA Romeo RobinHot TamaleGypped In Eqypt (Waffles & Don)Makin' `Em MoveThe Family ShoeToy TimeFly FrolicThe Cat's CanaryFarmeretteChinese JinksSilvery Moon"
2,Catchy idea for the mass market,"This book is inherently ridiculous. One goal of any serious eastern meditation practice is to eliminate the false dualities so often present in human perception - including the duality of male/female. It is also a selfleess means to the cessation of suffering as exemplified by desires and attachments. It is not a means to enjoy yourself shamelessly or indulge the senses in pleasure-seeking, for these too are delusions. This is apparently a niche marketing book aimed at women who want to find a way to relax. As such, it has some value for dabblers, but anyone who is actually interested in meditation should look elsewhere."
2,Disappointing,"Maybe it was just the mood I was in, but I couldn't get excited about any of the characters. I didn't even finish it. Gave it to the local library. I'm a quilter myself, and enjoy reading Underground Railroad stories, so you'd think this would have been right up my alley, but it just wasn't. Not that there was anything wrong with it exactly...it just wasn't my cup of tea."
2,The Sugar Camp Quilt,"A nice book for young readers. Writing style is simple. No surprises at the end, actually ""corny."" I would recommend it for a teenager."
5,My favorite in the series,This was my favorite book in the Elm Creek series. I had a hard time putting down because I wanted to see what was going to happen next. I enjoyed learning the history of the Elm Creek homestead and the neighbors. This book left me wanting to read on and on and I was sad when the last page was turned.
1,"Disappointed, but willing to try again","The title of the book interested me. I love quilting and I love history. I was also reassured by the quote on the cover that the books in the series could ""stand alone"", as I was unfamiliar with the author and all previous books. I had a very difficult time becoming interested in any of the characters, their lives and their problems. The seemed weak and lifeless to me. The language felt very stilted as well. I also noted very early in the book that scenes appeared that were, in some cases, almost word for word a copy of those found in Pride and Prejudice, both the book and the BBC mini series. It became almost laughable at points to compare the two. I would not recommend this particular book to anyone. I have been bolstered by the other fantastic reviews to give the other books in the series a try, but I'll visit the library to obtain them first."
2,Disappointing,"I,too,was disappointed. Though I missed the Elm Creek quilters from the previous books, I hoped that the plot would make up for it. It didn't. I knew what was going to happen within the first chapter or two. My overall impression was that it was a bit boring. I have friends waiting to get their hands on this book anticipating the next chapter in the lives of the Elm Creek quilters. I'm going to tell them to skip this one and see what next year brings."
5,The Sugar Camp quilt,"This was an excellent period book that takes you through the risks and dangers of being a ""stationmaster"" on the Underground railroad back in the civil war era. It mixes both romance, history, and quilting all in one very interesting read!"
4,Very enjoyable book!,"We listened to the CD version of the book on a trip recently and thoroughly enjoyed it!! I had never read any of the Elm Creek Quilt series books and because of this enjoyable book we will definitely look for others in the series. The characters are well defined, the story line well done, and overall very enjoyable."
3,"Good backdrop and historical detail, but rehash #232 of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice","Reviewer Joanne McPherson caught it exactly - Ms Chiaverini has definitely forgotten to credit Jane Austen and Andrew Davies as well for having borrowed plot lines, characterizations and dialog from their respective creations ( the 19th century novel Pride and Prejudice and the script for the 1995 BBC series based on the novel.)The setting of the story in the pre-Civil war period, the Underground Railroad, sugar maple farming and of course,quilting give the novel merit. I only wish that the author had worked these into a different plotline. Better luck in the next novel of the series!"
3,An old fashioned family,The Sugar Camp Quilt really does not go with the other books in the series. It should have been one of the first novels to come out-because of the time of the setting. If I hadn't read the rest of the series it would have been better. It really had nothing to do with quilting in a group or a quilting circle.
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to reading this new book in the Elm Creek series. I was disappointed. The other Elm Creek books have been hard to put down once I started reading. I didn't have that problem reading The Sugar Camp Quilt. You knew what was going to happen between Dorthea and Thomas when they first met. I love historical novels but this one was boring. I hope Ms. Chiaverini's next book is more like her other books, The Quilter's Legacy and The Runaway Quilt."
2,Not as nice as they used to be...,"I bought a 4 pack of these chairs over the summer. I had been looking because my sister has some that are a few years old that are awesome chairs! THESE ARE NOT THE SAME CHAIRS! I gave 2 to my brother and kept two for myself. Of mine, I use one exclusively and haven't even upwrapped the other one. With very gentle use, mostly in the back yard, mine has already torn... Right where the webbing wraps around the frame on the seat, along the side. For the price of these chairs I felt sure they'd last forever... I'm a little disappointed that I have one that barely lasted a season. The ones my sister has are the same brand and presumably these are a replacement for that discontinued model. The older chairs were MUCH better constructed."
3,"Cute, but easily broken","I love my ear cuff and it fits very comfortably; however, after having the cuff for a week the feather link came off the cuff. I put it back on and squeezed the metal together, but it still falls off sometimes and I have to be careful not to lose it. I really like the jewelry piece, but I am disappointed the feather was not more securely attached."
3,Feather Cuff Review,"I found that this cuff was rather nice but too thick for my ear. The width wasn't flattering but I have given it to a friend of mine and it suits her perfectly! Very comfortable, many great comments."
1,SONY NPF770,"I have to say that i have ordered the wrong product from this supplier and i was outside the country in a vacation when i came back the return period was expired, the dealer refused to even entertain any discussion with me to accept replacing the battery or return at half of its price.I really dont recommend anyone to buy from this supplier or vendor.thanks"
3,"Funny Man, Terrible Audience.","I love Tracy Morgan. He's one of the best natural comedians working today. Is you get a chance to see him live, go.But this DVD performance is mostly a train wreck.Why, please tell me why, the producer or director would choose to film a show in San Francisco?The audience is mostly made up of white bread, bay area yuppies sipping red wine!These are not Tracy's regular fans, and it shows.The audience is reserved and often seems insulted by Mr. Morgan's raw comdey stylings.Next time, film a show in Philly or Detroit. Tracy would be 100% better working off of a lively audience."
1,Rediculous,"I thought Tracy Morgan was funnier than that and he is in other things, but this was horrible. I wanted to return it, but I already opened it."
4,Pretty funny.,"This movie is quite funny. If you have ever been in a sorority you might understand why. The plot is between a girl who wants to join a sorority until everything goes bad and they pretty much kick her out of the sorority. It then at that point becomes a war between good vs evil.Overall the movie is good for the pre-tween to teen market. Its can be cheesy at some points, but what do you expect for a sorority movie? Worth a rental at Netflix or Amazon on Demand."
4,good viewing for all....,"this was a enjoyable movie,first saw it on my local cable tv station...after viewing it my daughter asked to see if we could purchase it...so i jumped on amazon to purchase it..thanks..."
3,College Days,"This was a really predictable movie. The good girl finished first.. And yes, girls are so catty just like the movie portrayed."
1,Wast!,This movie suck. It could have been better. It was a wast of money. Like really nothing even really happens to the other chicks
1,"Well, folks...","There are maybe 1-2% truth, wrapped up in 98-99% lies...The problem with the author - he is just a small-time rat cheating on his previous masters, a convincing tale-teller, though...If you wish to be misinformed, then this book is just what you need."
4,This should be a movie,"Once again McLeod takes a group of people at a place (family, club, coworkers) and examines them one by one. As with all his characters, the ones in Hollywood East are funny. As usual, McLeod's narrator, Christian Gallagher, savages most of them and I feel guilty laughing. He does show compassion for one, who is a coworker whose hands and feet were burned by an abusive father. It's nice to see this side of Gallagher. I hope there's more of this side of the character in future books."
1,not as advertised,I am very disapointed in my recent order as these vent shades do not fit on my '06 Jeep Liberty as advertised on the web site. The front shades are short and rear shades are much too long. Received package also does not list my vehicle even though the numbers match.
4,YAY!,"I have seen the whole Bottle Fairy series, and they are SO cute. However, this dvd is over-priced in my opinion. It's a cute series, but this is the price I would be willing to pay for the WHOLE thing, not just half of it!Bottle Faries is about 4 little fairies trying to become human. They live with a 20-something male whom you never learn much about. The fairies want to do everything humans do, but they get comically mixed up, and there-in lies the cuteness. There is one episode for each month of the year, and the activities of the bottle faries in each episode has something to do with that particular month, (fireworks in July, Thanksgiving in November, etc.) The series doesn't have a great plot, it's all just random cuteness."
4,Bottle Fairy's Vol 1,"Now I haven't seen the DVD their selling (since it's not out yet) but I have seen the entire series (13)eps.I'm assuming that this is the first 6 eps. And I's so happy there subbing them! I loved the whole bunch! What's better than 4 cute fairy's that are 2 inches tall looking to learn more about earth? This is in an interesting format, each eps is a different month...IE: March, April...you get the point. Over all I loved the show that I saw...so I'm excited to see the legal version and how well they translate some of the funnier parts, which ushually have to do with the fairy's missunderstanding words, or thinking they mean somthing else...which is easy to do since lots of japanese words mean more than one thing in different context. On a side note, do not be looking for a huge plot here, it's funny and very bubbly, but there really isn't much of a plot...if you enjoy Digi Charat then you will like this!"
4,good deal,I had bought the clear version of these earrings and loved them. The blue ones weren't as blue and sparkly as I had expected but were still a great bargain.
3,"This book is a choose your own adventure story, not a novel","I just received my copy of Combat Command and was disappointed to find that it was a combination choose your own adventure and war game story. I was hoping for another Troopers style adventure perhaps expanding on the doctrines and technology of the Mobile Infantry described in Heinlein's original novel. Unfortunately that was not to be. I gave it three stars and I will probably read it over thoroughly, but I am disappointed none the less. If there are any others out there as engaged in thinking about what the specifics of the Mobile Infantry might be drop me a line I would be interested in a discussion."
3,what's in a name?,"I was disappointed to say the least, that this was a ""choose your own adventure"" format, and not a novella follow-on to what I consider Heinlein's masterpiece. I gave the book one go over and then promptly donated it to the post library at Ft Campbell."
1,not worth the money,we got this for our 6 year old snake lover and it was a big disapointment. It only really goes straight and does not slither back forth at all. Poorly made. [...]
3,Only snake option out there,"My 10-year-old daughter has always been a snake fan and since we won't get her a live one, she's been asking for a remote control one for a couple years. I've done a lot of research and honestly, this is the ONLY option out there, just available in different colors for different prices. If you want something that looks cool and goes in a straight line, then this is great. If you want it to do tricks, forget it. If you want it on carpet or uneven tile floors, nope. And it is noisy enough as it rolls that you'd only be able to use it to sneak up on someone in a noisy environment. But for the snake lover with a flat surface, it at least gives the illusion of a moving snake with the tail slightly swishing as it goes. The remote's wire is very easily bent so it's not for super little kids, but other than that, we haven't had problems with it."
5,Good Quality Grill Cover,I recently ordered this grill cover for my husband's birthday and we were pleased with the quality when it arrived.
5,"If you love King Crimson, you'll love this","Very thick, rich, production, in a King Crimson Style. The song ""Bark's Lung is Ass Whipped"" should really be called ""Lark's Tongue in Aspic part 3"". I like this version of ""I am the Walrus"" better than the Beatles. Raimondi's version of ""Wichita Lineman"" is the best I've ever heard. Way better than the original. I you like King Crimson, ""Red"" or ""Discipline"", you will love this."
4,great value,Bought a few for the local toy drive. Great value. lot of little things for the kids to play with.
2,Screen Patches,"The description for this item is a little misleading. They are NOT self stick or stick of any kind. The square patch has open ended wires which you have to put through the screen holes(squares) and then bend the patch wires around to hold in place. It's tedious, irritating and a royal pain to do. After fixing one tear, I realized the patch kit is very visible. I switched to a light grey colored duct tape that has striations in the tape and it does a much better job and is not noticeable at all."
3,Good but not great,"Gives information that most of us already know --- or should. But it also offers up tips which I feel are not so great. I enjoyed reading it. But I didn't find a good deal of value. Some readers, however, will find it useful and I do wish more people would take care in writing email. Most people would indeed benefit from reading this. I'm always appaulled when a prospective client or client emails me with a ""yea"" or ""Hey"". Makes them look really bad. I figure if they write me like that, they're turning off their own customers and nothing I do for them will be of much value!"
2,"Great topic, mediocre results","Email is important, and it's great to see someone thinking consciously about how best to use it. Unfortunately, this book doesn't think hard enough. The book provides some reasonable advice (some of it common sense), but very little is backed up by data. The book's examples of bad or incriminating emails are the most vivid and entertaining sections, and probably the most valuable. The closing section touches on some practical guides like Getting Things Done and Inbox Zero...but then dismiss them in favor of a sort of quasi-organized half-assery. The book is also sprinkled with strange name-dropping - I had to look up who Bob Geldorf and Larry Kramer are, and I still don't understand why I would care what they have to say about email."
3,"Easy read, some good points","There are some good tips in this book and it was a quick, easy read, but I think most of the tips could have easily been summed up in a blog article.What I really wanted was more focus and tips on email tone. The authors nail it that people can have drastically different interpretations of emails based on their inner feelings and fears. However, I don't think they fully addressed how to style emails, especially work emails.I also wish they would have given some suggestions or case studies of how to get one's organization to improve email courtesy and management."
1,A commonplace guide.,"Send is nothing but a commonplace guide on email that the marketing gurus had the audacity to compare to the ""Elements of Style.""Each chapter is filled with obvious information on email: for example, ""The Seven Big Reasons to Love Email"" and ""The Eight Reasons You May not Want to Email"" are basic, skillfully written blogs of what we already know. Another chapter dedicates 24 pages to the difference between ""To"" and ""CC"": again, more information that we know. The most mind boggling chapter is titled, ""How to Write [the Perfect] Email"": a title that is undeniably deceitful. This fruitless chapter uses the poor writing style of a preteen as an example. To add insult to injury, the quick overviews on why to incorporate grammar and punctuation, as well as avoid capital letters and odd fonts is so 90s.Reviewing this book any further is a waste of valuable time and effort.Congratulations Messrs. Shipley and Schwalbe for formatting a simple editorial into a $19.95 book."
1,Even Bowser the dog could read this!,"I could not believe how elementary, basic and useless this book is. The only people I can think of that could make any use of this book at all are folks who do not have any etiquette skills and barely know what an email is. This book makes such earth shattering suggestions as not to write threatening emails or emails about insider information. Wow, there's something I'm glad I read about. Also, A large section of the book is spent explaining what the difference between CC: and To: is. Long discussions ensue on explaining both CC: and To:. I bought this book expecting a wealth of material on emailing for the average person and have instead found not one paragraph of useful information. For the first time I am returning a book to Amazon. Dreadful, absolutely dreadful. Even sixth graders are too advanced for this book's contents. I sorely wish I could give less than one star- this book has my complete disdain."
3,"""Send"" me more information, please","Easily readable, but a little light on information beyond common sense. I would have appreciated more information on developing subject lines that would cut through the clutter in people's inboxes. I felt I only learned 2 or 3 items of information that I didn't already know.However, the blessing of a printed book in this day and age is that I can freely pass it on to several friends who want to read it, thus amortizing the cost over several readers."
4,Tips & Some Good Common Sense,"Simple, simple book done with wit providing useful tips with heaps of common sense interspersed with interesting real life experiences. A great beginners guide and useful for those who just don't get the ""how to's and why's of good communication ... email or not."
1,Email Hype,"Not worth the money! Unless your thirteen years-old and just learning to send email most of us have learned these basics through trial and error (mostly error). I say ""delete"" this book from your reading list -- Steve"
3,Not for busy people who already posess common sense,"This book is okay. There's nothing wrong with this book. However, there are so many wonderful books to read and for most of us, so little time to read them that I suggest avoiding books of this nature. This book makes perfect sense. However if you already possess a good degree of common sense I think you'll not really learn much if anything in these pages. I found myself basically thinking ""no duh"" as I read this.In my opinion, it's a waste of time for people with half a brain."
2,SEND,I found this book overly verbose; not good for a minimalist. Also they pay no attention to people who just use the email for fun and communication.
5,Read before you SEND,"Any person who uses e-mail in the workplace has to read ""SEND"". This book offers the best look at how we can be efficient, less offensive, and more wise in our e-mail use. The guide is not elementary or dull. On the contrary, it offers constructive and entertaining examples of the potential minefields that lay ahead when we send before we think. In addition to illustrating bad habits, the book provides straightforward suggestions as to how we can become better e-mailers and as a result, more productive communicators. I have already adopted some of the rules from ""SEND"" and am encouraging my employees to do the same. I am pleased to say that I now approach my e-mails differently and the results have been noticeably positive."
2,I should send it back,"Most of the useful advice in this book could have fit into a magazine article. They go on far too long about the pitfalls of flame wars, misused ""reply to all"" responses and similar horrors and hilarities of email."
5,"""Native speaker's"" grammar book of e-mail","If you are naturally good at writing good e-mails, how do you teach someone else to compose better e-mails? It's like being a native speaker and trying to teach someone your language without knowing anything about grammar. You would need a textbook and here it comes!I actually got this book because I receive bad e-mails way too often. Time after time I'm shocked by how many people do this -- customers, colleagues, you name it! So in order to understand these offenders better I bought this book -- just as the subtitle of the book suggests.How would they not know these obvious things, I ask myself? This book helps you to get back to basics. It lays out things that sound trivial in a way which is never boring or dull. And as much as you think you know all this stuff already, you will certainly find a couple of useful advices from it."
4,Good money-making book for kids,"Very easy for kids to understand, this is one of the better moneymaking books out there. I really enjoyed reading this book for many reasons: it was easy to read, had some really good ideas, and the auther really knows what she's talking about. I strongly reccomend this book. I also recommend spelling recommend and author correctly, as I did not."
4,Great Money Making Ideas For Kids,"After reading this book I myself thought it was full of great ways for children to make a few extra dollars to buy there own toys and other things. It is filled with great ideas that not even I could have thought of. It is great to have a book like this that will teach them to make money so they aren't begging for more money from me. I am glad to have read this book, if you are looking for a book that will teach your kids the value of money and how to use it and make it, this is the book for you."
2,Loud but difficult to use,"We bought this on a whim at our local Home Depot after some serious issues with our 10yo that led us to need to know if he left his room at night. Well, little does HE know, I can't get the darn thing to work. I currently have 4 screw holes in my door from trying to get it just right to work. He has never heard what it sounds like to set it or unset it so he thinks its working but the thruth is...ITS NOT!I just fought with the thing some more tonight and can't get it to set. I get the 30 beeps and then a few moments of silence and then the darn thing beeps and goes off.Its loud as can be and is a great concept, it just doesn't seem to work."
2,Unable to install?,"I had the opposite problem with this unit, I am unable to keep it from going off. You have to press '4' to arm it, after that you get an annoying chime for 30 seconds until it arms. However it is not possible for me to get the magnetic unit and base close enough to remain armed. There is no way to have them touch with our door molding, and even a little bit of space seems to cause it to go off again with no other movement. The siren is loud and the code is a great feature. A little more flexibility (a few inches) on this would make it usable. But unless your door/window allows you place the side unit literally right against the base, I do not suggest purchasing this."
2,Get what you pay for,"For the price, I guess you get what you pay for. The product is cheaply made and the directions are not very good. I may be returning this product either because I am not installing it properly, or it is defective. Not a great product."
3,A Typical Jack Higgins Yarn,"""Thunder Point"" contains the elements that have made Jack Higgins popular: fast-paced action, romantic locales, a likeable anti-hero and a connection with World War II and the infamous Third Reich. Sean Dillon, the Irish bad boy, is saved from rotting in a Serbian prison by an old British foe. The catch? He must help retreive a briefcase full of damaging secrets submerged in a WWII German submarine somewhere near the coast of St. John in the Virgin Islands. And simultaneously he is assigned to protect the daughter of the diver who discovered the sub but didn't reveal its location before his untimely demise. Intrigue abounds in this entertaining, if implausible, yarn."
4,Another Good Yarn from Higgins,The two-tape abridgment read by Roger Moore keeps the story moving. It's a good quickie for a small road trip. The fanciful plot involves secrets from World War II that could ruin a lot of people. The great thing about Higgins: He's never dull and never stupid. You'll like this.
3,Thunder Point - Adventure at Sea,"Thunder Point is a gripping adventure novel about a young mans' quest to right the wrongs of his past. The story set in Europe and the Caribbean bids the question, can a man skilled in the art of death use his talents to help others? Thunder Points tells the story of Sean Dillion and his quest to answer this question. This novel is enjoyable reading."
1,"Good overall plot, but really really wretched details","I must say Thunder Point is a good and entertaining read as long as you're content with pure reading only, and that you take in everything Jack tells you. But what he tells you are cliche. The evil man is an out-and-out evil. The good ones are good to the bone. There is no subtleties, and this is the biggest thing I dislike. When Jack wants someone, either good or bad, to die or get seriously hurt, then just at the time of his impending death, he will be stupid to the extent that I can't really take in and die. This is certainly not my type and I don't think I'll read another Higgins again, or at least not another Dillon series."
3,Cookie Cutter Higgins,"Higgins can produce a very good novel, as in the case ofA Prayer for the Dying, which I believe is his best. This novel is not in that league. It is a quick, formulaic read; like its predecessor,Eye of the Storm, which introduced us to Sean Dillon. It doesn't waste time with character development or setting scenes. It gives you only as much information as you need to be able to tell who's who and what's what. It moves along at a very swift clip.There is a mistake here, in the bit of the seaplane sabotage/crash, where we are told that the reason for its problem landing on the water was the fact that the floats had been hacked, allowing water to enter. Of course, these same floats presented no problem during takeoff, which makes zero sense.These Higgins novels are ones you find in airport bookstores, to be read on long flights. The ride is easy and enjoyable, but they don't stick with you afterwards. You won't find yourself going back over them in your mind or quoting them."
4,Sitting Down To Eat,This book is put to good use in my Kindergarten classroom. All of the characters are adorable and the children love to hear me read the story out loud. I have created a super lesson where I have the children act out the story wearing costumes that I created resembling each animal. What a wonderful way to learn about sequencing. This offers me a great way to kick off our learning about how to use ordinal numbers.
4,Noah Had It Easy!,"Reads a lot like ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" by John Archambault. This rythmic, rhyming, counting book involves various jungle animals, and a small boy sitting down to eat. The animals pressure the boy into inviting them into his house, one-by-one.The text definitely does have a nice rythmic flow to it, which will keep children listening, and anticipating as the house gets more and more crowded with animals. A very, good counting book."
1,No good,"Ask yourself, have you ever seen this many 5 star ratings that are completely glowing for a no name artist? Hmm, perhaps someone *cough* *cough* is trying to dilute honest opinions from REAL reviewers.Follow these steps:1. go to www.adambarta.com2. view the video for ""I Told Her""3. stop laughing4. seriously, stop laughing5. decide whether you would like to purchase the cdAs for me, I've decided NOT to purchase this album.As a word of advice for those giving fake 5 star reviews: At least TRY to make it somewhat believable. Say the kid shows potential and it's a good start and give him 3 stars. That's horribly distorted but it's better than the blatant disregard for all things holy giving him 5 stars along with a comment like ""puts real sizzle in the ""pop"""". Perhaps that's the sizzle from the steaming pile of poo this song really is."
2,"Not so good, but better than live performance","I saw Adam perform recently at Heaven--a rather suspicious place to be performing a song about heartbreak from a girl. Anyway, this recording sounds bad, but let me just say, it is 10 times better than hearing him live. I urge you to buy a copy of this song before you actually hear him live, because if you do hear him live, then you'll really not want to support this talentless hack."
2,$1.00 A Minute Seems A Bit Overpriced,"At the cost of about a dollar a minute (37 minutes @ $34.95) I didn't feel this DVD was value for money. There are two - count 'em - two exercises only; one-arm pushups and a variation of the one-leg squat called the ""Pistol"". Both of these exercises are definitely NOT for beginners or even intermediate weightlifters. Very little actual instruction and no theory behind what is being demonstrated. The subtitle of this video is: ""Master the Secrets of the Super-Strong -- Using Bodyweight Exercises Only"". There must be more than two exercises needed to do this. Like most publications from Pavel and from Dragon Door, you don't get much content. It's mostly personality, esp. in Pavel's case. All of what's here can be got off various exercise and bodybuilding websites for free. Just google and save money."
4,Worth it!,"Great product! My three girls age 7,5, and almost three love it. The other reviews that mentioned the sand getting wet is true, but not very wet though and the kids actually like it that way. It's easier for them to make sand castles. My only complaint is that it could be a little deeper. Two bags of sand were all we needed, but because it's not very deep, sand falls out on the ground pretty easy which means you may have to buy more sand before the summer is over. Definitely keeps them entertained for a while and worth the money."
4,happy with this purchase,"We got this sand table for our 3-year-old last month, and he loves it. I had wondered if it might be too low, but it seems to be just right for my son who's about 37"" tall. One 50 lb. bag of sand was plenty to fill it. After reading complaints that when it rains the cover leaks due to holes where the elastic ties are, I decided to plug the holes with a little silly putty. That has worked so far! Overall, we're really happy with this sand table."
5,Fun for 2 yr old,We bought this for our two year old because she loves playing in the sand and this allowed her to do so without having to sit in it. Also love that it has a cover.
4,great sand table,"I bought this sand table for my 2 year old based on previous reviews. It is easy to put together, comes with some toys and has a secure cover. I would recommend it."
5,Entertainment on porch,My 2 and 5 year old love playing with the sandbox. It has a lock so I can say no sand at times. They both will play in it for a long time. Very fun!
4,Sturdy and Fun,"Bought this for my 15 month old grandson. He loves to dig and feel the sand. It is a good height and should be fun for at least a few years. It is on my screened porch so can't attest to it's waterproof status, but the lid does attach securely and the cat can't get into it!"
4,Simple Sand Table,Small sand table and low to the ground. Perfect for toddlers and holds 50lb bag perfectly. Not very deep so the sand spills over easily with a full bag dumped in.Left it outside with cover on and only a little rain leaked in. Overall happy! Two year old and four year old like it. Easy to move around even when it is full of sand.
5,TONS OF TODDLER FUN!!,It a perfect size my toddler daycare kids. They could play with Naturally Playful Sand Table all day long. Much less mess than a sand box because kids don't sit in it. I did add more cups and small toys for added fun. I love the top makes it safe for strays cats to NOT use as their little box. The bands that close very tight. Strong wind didn't blow it off last night. For $42 you really can't beat that price. I also got Water Wheel Play Table these go great together. LOVE IT! A must for parents and caregivers of toddlers!
3,Step 2 Natually playful sand tables revew,"Step 2 Natually playful sand table It's easy to put together and holds 50lbs of sand, it's not alot to sweep up on a daily basis. It does let water in but just on one spot it has the wet and dry ends that way and the top is a little flimsy. All in All The two year old is enjoying it and it is the right height for her. Glad we got it!"
4,Satisfied,"After reading all reviews, I decided on this sandbox. I like that it's elevated, though I wish it were a bit taller. Today was the first day my 2 year old played with it and she loved it. She pitched a fit when I told her it was time to go inside. I am going to keep it on our covered front deck so hopefully no rainwater will get in under the lid, which was one of the complaints others had. I do think that these things are way overpriced for what they are. I purchased 3 small bags of play sand at Wal Mart because I wanted to be sure I had enough, and I only put in one bag. It seemed like enough. I thought if I put in another one the lid would not fit well. The bags did not state the weight, so I'm not sure how much I used. The cashier thought they were 25 lbs."
5,"Great play,",This is good for the price. Sturdy and easy to assemble. Just what we needed for an outdoor play area. Good toy and I think any small child would enjoy playing with the sand table.
4,"Ok, but not perfect",My toddler really enjoys this sandbox. The lid fits well and we haven't had any problems with water entering the box if the lid is on. The only issue is that the plastic inside the box has seemed a bit flimsy and bends easily when there is any weight in the box. I only put 25 lb's of sand in the box at a time- it works for our needs.
3,Very nice table with one big problem,"As another reviewer noted, the lid included with this sand table does not keep the rain out of the sand. In fact, it seems to channel all the water that falls on the lid inside the table. Before I bought the table, I thought I'd just open the lid and dry out the sand after the rain stopped, but after the first not terribly severe storm, there were three inches of water sloshing around in the table.So I moved the whole thing into my daughter's bedroom and filled it with beans/dried popcorn. As an indoor table, it's great. The height is perfect for little ones (2-5 years) and the table is sturdy, stable, and reasonably attractive for a plastic toy."
2,Not So Happy,"I was so happy with the product, but by the end of summer I was SO mad. It was great at first, but eventually the lid stopped fitting and for the last few months of warm weather the sand sat under 3 inches of slimmy water. No amount of air or sun would have ever dried it out. Its such a good idea, but the lid doesn't keep water out. No one I know with regular sand boxes has trouble with water getting in so I don't know why this one does. Little Tikes needs to re-engineer it!"
3,VERY SHORT TABLE!!!!,"I'm very disappointed because when I was reading about this product I realized the description does not say how high the table is, so I looked at the reviews and saw ""Angie's"" review that said the table is 36""tall. IT IS NOT!!!! So after reading that it's 36"" tall, I decided this would be a perfect height for my children to play in. I just received it today and I should have never read ""Angie's"" review, because this table is NOT 36"" tall, IT IS 15.5"" TALL. NOW I HAVE TO RETURN IT...THANKS ANGIE!!"
4,Lots of Fun,My 2 year old son loves this sand table. It is the perfect height for him. He loves to shovel the sand & run his trucks through it. My only concern is that the lid does not keep rain water out and the sand gets wet. That still would not stop me from recommending this product. He loves it!
4,Small But Functional,"This is a lot more shallow than I thought it would be but it is still a great little sand box. Perfect for decks, porches, small backyards. Or just when you want to have something up and off the ground. Also, the cover is perfect and the holes that caused the issues before (in previous reviews) have now been sealed up so it doesn't leak."
2,Typical,"A typical report by an archaeologist, very few details are given for the sites listed in this book. There are no maps either. Lots of good info, but unfortunately very useless without more details."
1,Cost as much to ship as the screen itself,Be careful they are trying to charge you as much to ship this screen as it costs.Highway robbery ...so to speak
2,Kind of a Road to Nowhere,"Maybe someday, someone will write a good book on memes, but I don't think this is it. There's just no ""there"" there, if you know what I mean. The book has a few interesting thoughts on classifying memes and how they reproduce, but after the first couple of chapters, nothing much seemed to occur, except a recitation of examples of things that might be classified as memes of one sort or another. Perhaps. If you ask me, no one has improved on the chapter that Dawkins wrote in Selfish Gene that introduced the meme concept."
5,Another Brilliant Work from a Great and Original Thinker,"I learned about this book by reading Lynch's excellent article ""Thought Contagions in the Stock Market"" in the Journal of Psychology and Financial Markets. The article only hints at how widely the new tools of thought contagion analysis apply beyond the financial markets. But when I bought the book, I was not disappointed at all. While the book is written on a level that everyone can understand, the scientific ideas it proposes will have lasting significance in social theory, philosophy, and policy making."
4,Effective Overview and Introduction,"Thought Contagion is perhaps lacking in some of the areas addressed by Amazon.com's readers, but most certainly not all. It is true that Aaron Lynch leaves little in the way of hard research within his book. However, Thought Contagion is not meant to be a weighty academic dissertation-it is meant for the layperson. And in this respect, the book fascinating.With not a word wasted, Mr. Lynch covers nearly all the bases in his primer to memetics. His observations and conclusions are often striking both in their logic and lucidity.The book is a worthwhile introduction to a fascinating new field."
1,Not worth reading,"Aaron Lynch commits errors of the worst of ""evolutionary"" writers. He finds a social phenomenon (women being domestic workers, couples owning homes, etc.) and comes up with an explanation for it off the top of his mind, couching this explanation in scientific sounding jargon. This is not science. Science demands some proof or evidence for a hypothesis. In addition, it's not very hard to think of explanations for many of the social phenomena that he describes -- most people could come up with a dozen or so ""memetic"" or ""evolutionary"" reasons why couples might buy houses. This book lacks both wisdom and scientific vigor."
1,thought contagion shmlagion,"Dear reader. This review was precipitated by my recent procuremnet of Susan Blackmore's Meme Machine. As I perused the first few chapters, I realized how vapid and apassionate Lynch's book was. How much more entertaining Blackmore's description is! Lynch is like a K-mart cowboy attepting self-indoctrination into a new landscape over which he is unable to traverse. As you read, you feel anguishingly bootstrapped to a neophytic writer whose prose is as unnavigable and fractured as the badlands of Bryce Canyon. I read 30 pages. It was the first book I've put down unfinished since I tried Thomas Pynchon when I was 6."
1,There's no such thing as a meme,"A sack of conjecture clothed as science.For example - optimistic people have more children leading to greater propagation of the 'optimistic personality meme' (p71). Interesting! In addition, one must hope that the development of a science of memetics can lead to the quantification of how much optimism 'reality warrants'. Thanks to the optimism meme we're all happier than we should be.It should not be forgotten that the 'meme' is merely a vaguely defined, hypothetical element of social transmission; let's not get carried away. I bet Richard Dawkins wishes he'd never bothered coining the term.Robert Aunger's 'The Electric Meme' demonstrates a more credible effort to grasp this rather strange notion.Apparently, if you hold a seashell to your ear it's memes you can hear - not the sea (Anon,2003)."
5,The best portrait filter you can buy...,"Most importantly...This is a specialized filter for portraits, and a great filter for interviews when you are shooting video with a DSLR. This is NOT the filter to choose when shooting outdoors in landscape settings, or when shooting clients against props like trees and cars.Trust me, this filter is incredible when used for what it was designed to be used for.With portraits this filter hides blemishes and gives a soft smoothing effect to a client's skin, while retaining sharpness and balance. With video, it enhances depth of field in addition to the above, and is a great tool when shooting with Interview style lighting.In the hands of a semi-professional or a professional, this is an invaluable tool to enhance your work. I love how they come in different grades from 1-5, so you can adjust the amount of effect. In addition, you can purchase them with a skin warming effect built in, and really enhance the look of your clients."
2,pricey & make no different,i purchase this becz it stated that it blurr pic and give it a soft image. I don't see any difference in the result. sorry to give it a poor rating.
4,pitty that nobody would hear it,"It is kind of a tragic destiny for artists coming from the ""outer world"", far away from showbiz mainstream. Rundek, who is Croatian, and his multinational band based in Paris, France, have a very little chance to be recognized anywhere than in his hometown Zagreb. Personaly I would like to hear them playing at the Stone NYC, or at the Tonic,or at the Knitting Factory. If heard by someone from the downtown music circle, they maybe would not make big money, but it would definitely result with some big music. And that is what it should be about."
5,Barbie NASCAR Jeff Gordon Barbie Doll,"She loves fast cars and the men who drive them! Jeff Gordon is one of the most successful and popular NASCAR drivers ever, and Barbie's his number-one fan! She comes dressed for a day at the track with a red leather-like DuPont #24 jacket and cool blue hip-huggers. Barbie's black leather-like belt and knee-high boots complete the outfit. Stands 11 1/2-inches tall."
4,Good Barbie,Nice doll...should have come with additional clothes/accessories though since the price was a bit high.
5,wonderful novel,"I am not normally a reader of frontier or western novels, but I picked this up because a good well read friend raved about it. She was right! It is beautifully written, so beautifully that the enormous amount of detail about military life on the frontier is neither tedious nor boring, but rather fascinating and engrossing. It is easy to sympathize with the main character, whose mental and spiritual deterioration is the axis of the plot. One really feels his pain, yet the pain is redeemed by the quality of the prose, which, in my case, at least, inspired me to eagerly read on to the novel's depressing but unsurprising conclusion. For all lovers of fine writing!"
2,Depressing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. Needless to say, I found it depressing. Not every book has a happy ending. This wasn't even close! I was hoping for so much more about her life with the ""People"". That was skimmed over at best."
1,Do not buy this camera (from a long time Canon customer),I have bought and used Canon products for years and own and SD450. Unfortunately I have encountered the now famous Canon-related E18 error (the lens gets stuck). I discovered that a lot of other owners have the same problem and have taken very good care of their cameras. Please don't purchase this camera and spend your $$$ on a more durable camera. Just want to spare others from experiencing my same fate.
5,Great pics & easy to use!,"I received the Canon Powershot Elph for my birthday last year and I love this thing. I'm not the most computer-savvy person in the world, but this camera was so easy to use. I felt like there was no way to screw it up. Takes excellent pictures, is very light-weight and even fits in my little purse with ease. Easy to load them onto the computer too. If you're looking for a good digital camera or your friends & family need good gift ideas for your next birthday or the holidays, this is the one to pick!"
1,Screen Damage from very little use,"Great camera, really great quality and all features. Until you have it in your pocket, bag or anything that allows a slight pressure on the LCD screen. Now the camera is essentially worthless and I'm out over $300. Took it to a retailer who said this is common due to how close the LCD is to the edges, which is of course where the damage is. The glass didn't break, only the internals. Cannon won't fix it."
2,Great Pictures - Very fragile,"At first I loved thes camera. It takes excellent photos, the auto settings work well and I like the manual flexibility. I thought my only complaint would be the clunky zoom controls.BUT, in less than a year, I've broken the screen on my SD 450 twice. I had never broken a camera, phone or any other piece of electronic gear before. The screen on this model is extremely fragile. The first time it broke (inside a waist pack), Canon repaired the camera under the warranty. The second time (inside the case Canon makes for this model, inside a briefcase) it's costing $113.44 to repair.I can't recommend this camera & I'm angered by Canon's refusal to recognize that they have a problem with the screen."
3,Great features - fragile screen!!!!,"Our unit at work purchased several of these cameras for documenting field work. Even though we have all taken great care with them, we have 2 broken LCD screens which means the camera is pretty much junk.Up until the screens cracked though, this is one of the better point and shoot cameras I have used. Fast reaction to button push, fast flash recovery, etc. Much better than my personal camera, but I only paid $130 for my personal camera which I abuse terribly and it still works after 2 years. This Canon is useless after 6 months."
1,the dreaded Canon E18 error got us!,"I bought this camera for my daughter. It's 4 months old. With careful use, it has 3 pin white dots on the screen and now sports an E18 error and the lens is stuck open. We were told that the lens was jarred so it's not covered under warranty. We now own a $300. paper weight! Before buying google ""Canon E18"", there's a class action suit in the works."
4,the pros of this camra,even though i only hve this camra for one day i know its the best camra almost my whole grade has it and they all love it the best thing about the camra is the zoom while videoing and its small take my advice we dont ned anything better its great!
2,Compact but picture quality not worth the money!,Cons:Flash is BAD. Really bad photos in a dark room or on a gloomy day. Photos in broad daylight are good.Video Capture is average but audio is BAD.Pros:Size - SD450 is compact and it will easily fit into your shirt pocket.Weight - LightResponse time - GoodEasy to handle
2,"a ""real horror story""",I ordered this camera and was told it would get to me in 5 days. The 5 days turned into 3 weeks and it still was not here. It finally wss reshipped to my secondary address and got to me. It was very frustrating to be waiting for a camera that you already have an extra battery. I really wasn't going to use amazon again. I relented and have not had any trouble since then.
3,LCD Screen!!!,"Had my SD450 for 6 months of pampered care and the LCD screen is all scratched up. I've had 4 previous digital cameras and never had a scratch on those. Seems to scratch all by itself. It's incredible. Thanks to Costco's 100% satisfaction guarantee I took it back today. No questions asked!! Can't beat Costco!!!! Other than that, the camera took nice pictures and was very quick."
4,A fantastic point-and-shoot camera!,"I bought this camera 3 months ago to replace my horrifically slow Samsung digital camera. The SD450 takes fantastic pictures, with a quick shutter speed. You don't need to be a genius to operate it, either. The videos taken are quite nice, too. I only wish the high speed video mode (60 fps) would last longer than one minute. A great, moderately priced compact digital camera."
5,Great digitable camera!!!!,This is a really great camera and takes really wonderful and professional looking photos! I have two babies and I am using my new camera daily! If you buy this camera you should also buy the upgraded memory card because the 16 MB is not enough. I also really love the software that comes with the camera as well. Its very easy to use. I highly recommend this camera!
1,a lot of E18 Error on this camera!,"My Camera SD450 Digital ELPH (5M) is just 15 months old.. Upon searchingfrom the web, a lot of Canon customers have this E18 error, which pertainsto the lens not extending/retracting properly.. I wasted my money on this.I thought Canon is a good brand for cameras, apparently not!"
4,"Tiny camera, big performance","I'm delighted with this camera. I've had it about 3 weeks, used it most days, have taken some beautiful pictures, and I'm still exploring all its features. This is a great camera for people who like to futz with manual settings. Of course you can do automatic point-and-shoot too. I love the tiny size (no bigger than my cell phone), big screen, and long battery life. I recommend buying the biggest, fastest memory card you can afford and a package of screen protectors. I didn't give the camera 5 stars because you need to take the battery out of the camera to use the charger that comes with it, and the little plastic cover for the USB port isn't as robust as I'd like. But those are minor issues with an otherwise wonderful camera."
3,Photos aren't sharp of by today's standards.,"The Canon SD450 is very small and light for travel but it's photo quality isn't quite up to 2010 standards. Colors are very good but it lacks image stabilization so I had a hard time getting sharp, in-focus photos. It only has 3x zoom. The zoom lever and mode switch were a bit hard for me to operate but maybe that's because the used camera was 5 yrs old when I bought it. There are newer small, compact camera models with IS and much more zoom. I prefer those."
5,Great little camera!,"I got this as an upgrade to our SD300, which is also very good. The main features I like are:-Large LCD: this is great for the kids as they like to watch themselves right after filming.-Movie mode: seems quite good, especially for such a small camera.-Form factor: very small and portable. Fits in any pocket. Well, maybe not that little pocket within a jeans pocket. Any normal pocket though.-Solid build: seems a little better than the SD300.-Picture quality: I take mostly snapshots at 5x7. Sometimes 8x10. For these sizes it does a nice job. Even the macros seem ok. If you want higher quality you probably have to get a bigger camera.-Included software is also very good."
5,What else do you really need?,"I was looking for a good quality, compact digital camera that I could carry around with me. This camera obviously has the same limitations of all compact digitals, but is easy to use, takes fantastic shots and slips easily into a shirt or pants pocket. If I wanted a digital camera to do more, I would by a more expensive SLR camera. For everyday use, this camera is great quality and great value.I would recommend this camera to anyone."
3,Great PhD camera but lacks 2 basic features,"This camera is also known as the IXUS 55 in some parts of the world. This is a good buy for a PhD (Press here Dummy) camera, and has interesting features for editing and picture stitching. For a compact camera that packs so much inside it, I find that it lacks 2 basic features - (1) the ability to manually adjust the shutter speed, and (2) the ability to set the aperture size. To add on, you can only set the camera to a maximum of ISO400.Though the auto mode was good, but I found that it could not take shots with movement as well as still picture. This camera does great with stills, and there are many presets for it, but it lacks a range of presets for moving shots. It took me awhile to find it in ""Kids and Pets"" settings, but the quality degrades if we choose to turn off the flash in taking moving shots."
3,Photos aren't clear,I bought a SD450 and took it back because it would not focus. The replacement focuses better but the shots just aren't clear. I have a 3.2 mp Olympus which doesn't flash properly anymore so I wanted to replace it and upgrade. That camera's picture are WAY clearer than the Canon's. Am I jinxed? Could I have received two defective cameras? Others who have this camera don't seem to have my problems.
2,I think I'm going to return it...,"Well, I bought this for the size and because it's recommended by Consumer Reports. HOWEVER, I have several major complaints:1) the pictures just are not that great (focus-wise)2) the flash completely overpowers pictures so that subjects look all white3) the red-eye reduction does not work at all... I was unable to get indoor shots of my children without glowing red eyes4) the zoom is not very strong... I would rather be able to zoom in more5) As others have noted, there is no battery indicator.Oh well, I guess this is going back. I guess I'll start researching cameras, again!!"
2,Camera with a little fault,"The camera is good, just as promised. The only fault I found with it is that the cover for USB connection is broken and falls off every time USB is used. This does not influence the quality of pics of course, but it's an incovenience because the part is small and could be easily misplaced. On the other hand, the camera was bought as used, sserves its primary function so I would say I got a good product for the price. Nevertheless, had I known about the faulty cover I would not have bought it."
4,Great Camera,"I love this camera. These days there seems to be smaller/slimmer cameras available and that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.Large viewing screen, several great options, easy to transfer to my computer and simple rechargable battery."
3,it is ok,This one is good for my trip home. The one reason I am not very happy is that the responding time is a little bit long for me. Maybe I am little picky. But it is okay for beginner.
4,Fast repair,"I asked for this camera for my birthday based on the favorable Amazon reviews. I received it in April and have been very happy with the photos it has taken. Unfortunately in August it stopped working. However, I sent it in with my receipt and they fixed it with no questions and I had it back in my hands in about two weeks or less. I think this is a great little camera for daily point-and-shoot and I would buy from Canon again based on their excellent customer service."
5,"Great product, nice pictures","This is a great and not expensive camera, it takes wonderful pictures, I am loving it, I recommend it."
5,Highly educational and fun for all ages!,My husband and I enjoy traveling and learning about where we go. He's been to 37 countries and still this game poses a challenge! It's fun and you can pick up a few new facts about the world.
1,THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE!!!!!,"This game is ridiculous. I am in the middle of playing my second game, and I want to throw this horrible Christmas gift in the trash. I can not tell you how bad this game is. The questions are either so easy a 5 year old could answer it, or so hard that a well read college professor and world traveler would be running to the nearest computer to google the answer. If you aren't going to be able to get ""around the world in 80 days"" your better off getting every question wrong and staying at the start line because your opponents will use up more days traveling to other continents. I actually won the first game using this strategy. Please use extreme caution when purchasing this game for it will only anger people who have not traveled to a large amount of countries or aren't extremely well read.This item is out of stock now. Hopefully they don't make anymore."
4,Wonderful Book for lovers of classy decorating,I love browsing the pages and pictures in this book. The details are astounding and give great ideas for little flourishes that can add a lot to any party. The pictures of homes and English decorating are captivating as well. I recommend this book for anyone looking for unique ideas for formal parties or holiday gatherings.
2,Horrible Smell,"The bag seems okay but it reeks of outgassing plastic/rubber. I put it out in the sun for a few days and when I'd go out on the deck, even at night, I could smell it. I'm not particularly sensitive to smells and I don't necessarily avoid plastic but this is ridiculous. Also, the way the lining works -not sealed at the bottom- may make sense somehow -but I don't see it."
5,Answer to Guestion,This book has opener a new way of looking at the Bible and its meaning.I had so many question tha i have the answers to Thank You N.Ervin
2,a religous look at marriage,"This book is way over priced! I learnt nothing from this book, however it could be of help to a very younge, religous couple, new to military life. I do believe that there are better books out there that could be more help and that are cheaper."
1,Crap in a box,"My Mother-in-law bought this for my daughter for Christmas. And it is definietly not as expected. Even though it is wood, it is so chincy and cheap looking. Paint has actually starting falling away and pieces of wood from the stool are as well. There is nothing holding the drawer in place so if your toddler gets ahold of it they can yank it out, which easily lands on feet or legs. OWIE! as my daughter would say. The mirror is fake, which is good...but so awful looking. I would NOT buy this if I saw it in person."
1,Buy this if your hubby needs a project to work on!,"My daughter was so excited to get this for Christmas. As I was putting it together, that quickly faded away. The piece for the drawer is too big. My husband will have to saw it. One leg for the stool won't screw in as the hole is not deep enough. My husband will have to fix that too. Also, there is nothing to attach the mirror to the table top. There are pre-drilled holes for screws but it has no threads. The instructions were not correct as the pieces in the package did not match the list on the instructions. My daughter really wanted a nice place to sit down and beautify herself and this just isn't that place! It's sitting in a corner not fully put together because it's too frustrating. Maybe the one I was sent was from the reject pile."
2,vanity,"I was very excited to buy this for my daughter, but ended up being very dissapointed with the work that went into putting it together. Not only did I have to 'fight' to screw the leg pieces in (eventually spraying the inside so they would work)but a part of the wood inside the drawer broke right in half with very little pressure ( I had to glue it and am not sure how long that will hold). For a toddler, it looks nice, but I dont think its worth the hassle!! I would not recommend purchasing this product."
3,serves its purpose,"my kids love it! we hate it! none of the legs fit right, we had to use wood glue, four of the screws were missing, but after taking a few hours to glue and buy more screws to put it together...it was perfect on christmas morning! except the chair legs, still wobbly."
1,I Dont Know,I would not recommend using this company. I order this item 2 weeks before Christmas and still have not received it. I have tried to call but keep getting sent to different people. Avoid wasting your money!!
4,Good for my Konica Minolta A200,"I lost the original lens cap of my Konica Minolta A200. The lens size is 49mm, so I bought it. Yes, it's good fit for that. It's not easy to attach if lens hood is attached, but it's OK."
3,Pentax lens cap not as pictured,It's not the one pictured in the photo. The cap I received is a different style Pentax cap. I like the style with the release tabs on the outside of the cap instead of on the inside. Makes it easier to remove. Otherwise it will do the job. If you are looking for an exact cap like the picture shows you might want to inquire before spending. Service was fine and the cap is OK just not as repersented in the photo.
4,"Not the best Kerouac, but worth the trip","This is only mediocre Kerouac, but that's still better than most writers' best stuff. Kerouac's alter-ego wanders around France looking for his roots, but finding only bars and sadness. It's fairly depressing, but extremely short, and contains enough literary gems and insight into the declining state of Kerouac's powers to make it a worthwhile read. But if you are new to Kerouac, read On the Road, Dharma Bums, Desolation Angels, Maggie Cassidy, etc. first."
5,Great story--nothing to do with Halloween,"This is a great story that can help people of all ages, even though geared to children, understand the message of the Gospel in a creative way. This doesn't have to be associated with the celebration of Halloween. I know that many people who profess to be Christians still like to celebrate Halloween and feel that this story helps to tie it to their faith. That shouldn't make this a bad book for those who don't think Halloween has a place in the lives of Christians. Putting a face on a pumpkin to do something fun during fall harvest is a spiritually neutral activity. It just doesn't have to be about Halloween. I am glad that people like Ms Higgs take the time to do something positive for this time of year--something that takes the focus OFF of Halloween."
1,Jack o'lantern belongs to the Pagans.,"This starts out sweet about how the farmer plants the seeds in July...harvests them come Oct. Then along with verses, takes the pumpkin and carves a ""jack o'lantern"" (smiley face). No matter how much you want to make it a ""Christian"" event...it is not. Halloween is Halloween. Not a Christian holiday. We are to be separate from the ""world"" people! Has anyone ever studied about Halloween and its origins? I do not believe God would want us to be a part of it. I believe Satan is enjoying ""Christians"" sharing with him his special day."
1,Halloween and Christ?,"I have to agree with the fact Christians are trying to make halloween something God wants. Halloween has been changed so it appears to be nothing but fun, however, it all started because some ""high priests"" long ago wanted to worship the lord of the dead! They taught that the souls of the wicked dead inhabited the bodies of living people. These people would then go scare people until they gave them food, shelter, and entertainment. They also carved faces in pumpkins to help scare the people. Do we really want to continue to support such a thing? In an attempt to get rid of Halloween, the Roman church moved All Saint Day to Nov.1st.... it didn't work."
2,A fun book with too many errors.,"I have enjoyed logic puzzles ever since I was first given one in math class in 8th grade, so when I recieved this book as a Christmas present this past Christmas, I was excited to dig in and rub my brain cells togeather.Unfortunately as two other reviewers have mentioned, I too have found that this book has a good deal of errors to it.While I admit that no author should be expected to be perfect, the point of a logic puzzle is to logically deduce withheld information to come up with the answer to the proposed problem, however this becomes impossible when not enough information is given to begin with and the reader has to jump to a conclusion, and merely hope that it is the same conclusion that the author made. I found an example of this in problem number P3-1a last night, which led me to write this review. Hopefully in the future the author will take more care in the puzzles he creates to make sure that they actually have a solution!"
1,Many logic errors,"I will keep this quick, I have found a number of logic errors like all the other reviews. but to the authors credit he was a management consultant wich using the authors power of deduction means he doesn't know anything to a point where he never could get a steady job!"
4,"Expensive, but if you need it...","Obviously, the price of this thing is a turnoff. But consider what it can do for you. I use it for macro and nature photography. There are remote options and competing products from other manufacturers, but Pentax's own accessory seems to be readily available, and you know it's going to work reliably with the camera. I admit that I hated departing with that much money to buy this product, but it delivers what I want and reliably so. I'm happy."
4,Does what It's supposed to do,I recommend this for anyone who uses a digital camera. The cord is a bit short if you need to move a way from camera. I bought an extension for my camera.Reason why only 4 stars. But for the price your not going to be disappointed with this handy little tool.
1,Does not work onPentax K2000,This device does not work on the K2000 Pentax as stated in another review. Use the cheaper wireless remote.
3,handy tool,"the Pentax cable release is a very handy tool, works all the desired functions including bulb mode and multi-exposures however for the price the cord could be longer, it's only 18"". 3' would of been nice."
4,Pentax CS 205 Cable Release,Received the CS 205 Shutter release cable for my Pentax K20D.I have only shot a half dozen photo's indoors with it thus far.Works fine. The K20d's Auto Focus focuses when the shutter button is pressed half way down.My only gripes are (1)that the cord could be longer.(2) The button could be designed with a large tang for better grip when trying to release the button from the locked position. I guess as the switch wears it will be easier to push back to release from the locked position.(3) The end that plgus into the camera could be a straight plug instead of being a 90 degree end. There is very little room to grip the plug end as the access door is right there and people with big fingers might have difficulty unplugging the cord.I've included several pictures up above.
2,mostly useless.,"Bought for taking night shots, which is basically useless. if you're aiming for night skies, just use film. Digital becomes very noisy, fast.Otherwise, 30 seconds is plenty long exposure for whatever you're going to use. Tripod/2 second timer does well to avoid shake. It's also very, very short.Basically, if you need some kind of remote, use a remote."
1,Inked,"The book had a blotch of purple ink on the bottom of nearly every page; I sent it back and asked for a book that wasn't damaged, but obviously that never happened."
3,False Advertising?,"Take note: this is not actually the first four books of poems, but the first four books of poetry BY LOUISE GLUCK. It's a finicky distinction, but an important one when you think about it."
4,Great for fans,I got this for my three year old who loves the Plastic Man that is on the Batman Brave and the Bold series. This one has some similarity but doesn't really hold his attention like the other one does.
3,Not complete but a great series,When i first got this in I was happy. It wasn't until I got home that I noticed that this is not complete. There are no Plastic Baby cartoons nor does it have the Live Action segments. I have found memories of watching the Live Action Plastic Man and was really upset when they didn't even put those in.Other than that the show is great and I like the fact that some of villains are from the Plactic Man comic book series.
3,"A ""not so"" complete collection","The first time I've heard this series was coming to DVD was back in 2009. Let's say it was a good thing I've waited for the price to drop. I don't like the episodes being on PAL format (meaning the pitch was high, and the quality of the picture varied). That's why I gave this review three stars, because of the quality.I give the series five stars. I enjoyed Plastic Man as a kid through reruns (The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show live action version via syndication) and later, Cartoon Network. All of the first season eps (excluding the preview episode from the '79 ABC Satam preview special) are present. Three second season eps (with ""The Plastic Man/Baby Plas Super Comedy Show"" titles, minus the supporting segments) are present. It's great to add these to my Hanna-Barbera collection (Yes, this series was produced by Ruby-Spears, NOT Hanna-Barbera).Either way, enjoy the DVD's."
1,Toddler would not give it a chance,"My son falls asleep lots in the carseat, this would work great if he would keep it on, he refused to use it, and since you need to slide it on while he is awake and out of the seat it did not work for us."
1,Completely worthless,"I was really disappointed in this item. It doesn't work! It pushes my son's head forward, it's uncomfortable and I can't imagine him every being able to nap with it.Torture device yes... Head Support, no."
5,Ultimate Lego Book,I have 3 boys who all clamor to look at this book. They all love legos and this book has great pictures and inspiration. It's a must for any avid lego fan.
2,ultimate lego book,"The book is certainly not what I expected given the title - The ULTIMATE Lego Book. It is a very thin book with few if any instructions to assist children. It cost me over $A180 and it is certainly not worth the cost (this figure of course included postage to Australia - but certainly not express airmail or any such thing). For this kind of money, I was expecting something very comprehensive and I feel I have been taken for a ride."
5,A must-have for any LEGO fan!,"Beginning with the LEGO timelined story from the early 20th century to today, then ending with the LEGO parks and master designers and builders, this book will entertain and delight any LEGO fan at all. Excellent layout as well as good pictures and good choices of subject material make this a book that is impossible to put down."
5,Ultimate book for Lego creators,"This book is not just a book a cool Lego creations, it's a book that describes the company that has forever changed the children of this generation. Parents with children who like to take things apart turn to Lego to turn their destructive nature into constructive fun. This book is a must-have for all Lego maniacs."
4,Creative and Interesting,This book is an ultimate hit. The history of the Lego is described and then creations that fit every category are shown. Some of the hints on how to build things are really helpful.This book IS for anyone who likes Lego's.
5,Ultimate Lego Book,Great book for kids who are LEGO maniacs. Gives them creative ideas on what they can do with these wonderful building blocks.
2,The Ultimate Lego Book,"The best thing about the book was the company I ordered it from... honest and reliable. What more can you ask for when buying on line, sight unseen? I would take a chance on ordering anything else from them."
2,Not what I expected,It would be a great bag if I were 13 but I'm 42. I thought it was more like this messenger bag I received when I bought some swiss army cologne from macy's. It's a large flap messenger bag with the swiss army cross and a cell phone pouch on the outside. The inside is one large bag. Very simple design. Guess I'll just keep looking.
4,Perfect for lounging in the pool; needs to be more durable.,"I have an earlier version of this product, and mine lasted about 3 years, with the fabric ripping when the feet rest, then somehow the inflatable itself busted and we could no longer fill it up. 3 years for this type of product is a pretty good value in my opinion. I am ordering another one because I loved it so much.This is perfect for reclining in the pool - not really lying out flat because that's difficult with the pillow being where it is, but sitting/slight reclining while talking with other people in the pool and having a cool beverage. You can put your legs up, or let them dangle. The construction of the wire material makes the float keep it's shape. Easy to get into a car or other place for storage since it's flexible. It always retains it shape when in use. The fabric cover needs to be a little sturdier for longer-lasting use."
3,RECLINER FLOAT,"I like the product however the stitched seams that connect the body float to the recliner float are giving way on both sides and are beginning to fray. I'm not sure if it can be restitched and it may end up looking like ""heck"". Nevertheless, the product is a very nice pool lounge but could stand to be a bit more durable."
4,Ooops. Please be careful,"I foolishly ordered this item believing it to be the collection of short stories by Kathryn Forbes. I did not discover my goof until delivery. The error was entirely mine, but the Amazon page for I REMEMBER MAMA does not prominently announce that this is the STAGE PLAY SCRIPT, not the original short story collection."
1,confused,This book was advertised as an actual book and I received a thin play about the book. I was very disappointed.
1,very disappointed,"We received no telescoping pole and the bulb did not heat up at all. They sent us another bulb, it still did not work.We are very disappointed"
1,Stick to the propane patio heaters,So disappointing! I set it up today for the first time. It is 61 degrees out and no wind...and nothing!
3,Looks great!,"It looks very nice and practical but I am waiting to do some improvements in my cabinets so I can install it and start using it. I had several of those in Europe, where they are very common, and they always worked perfectly."
3,Hard Cheese.,"I'd heard some Panacea and was impressed w/ the heaviness of the tunes, so I decided I'd check out this full length. I have to say, it gets old real quick. Like Aphrodite, Panacea seems to be unable to get out from under his tried and true formula. The songs on this cd just have no range. It's all big room house/club-style vocals over what would otherwise be punishingly heavy tunes. Repetitive, unfortunate, and not worth the time. His bio portraits in the liner are, however, worth a good laugh, though unintentionally."
4,Hales point,"Good reading, if you are in to Romantic Novels. Although more interested of French Revolution, Civil War etc, the writers structure kept me interested all the way to the final page"
5,BUY it,"When we disembarked from a cruise ship at Freeport, Bahamas, there was a live band playing reggae hymns. I searched online for a collection like the band..and this was it!!! Awesome."
3,Quiet terror,"I found this at a garage sale. There are 22 stories in this book. This is a nice mix of supernatural, and scary stories that make you uneasy. If you like stories with a subdued menace try to find this book, you'll enjoy it. You will have to take your time, the author slowly builds up the suspense in each tale."
5,Refreshing approach,"Tired of the same old ""wedge foot in door, give presentation then close"" mentality? This manual offers a refreshing view of a better method for client management. If you feel your time and resources are too valuable to waste them putting the hard sell tactics on uninterested parties, purchase this book."
2,Verbose to the extreme,Jeff Thull has mastered the art of stretching a few concepts into a book-length publication. Everything worthwhile could have been said in 10-to-15 pages.
4,It works.,"This was ordered to replace a defective unit. Apparently these ""magic switches"" do not last forever and are a constant problem. I wish manufacturers would not install them in their china and curio cabinets."
1,No luck,Writing this review for my sister who purchased three of these last week. I installed them in kitchen cabinets for cabinet lighting and the first one wouldn't keep the lights on. They turned off by themselves in about 10 seconds. The second one I installed worked great for a couple hours but then wouldn't turn the lights off. Tried various different things to make it work but no luck. Unplugged them until the next day and tried it again. They came on as soon as I plugged the unit in and wouldn't shut off. It was a great idea and I wish it would have worked.
1,Don't waist your time,First one I ordered did not work at all. I sent it back. The lights did come on with the second one but had to really mess with it to work. So i sent it back a was charged a restocking fee??? For a item that does not work. Not worth the stress. Keep looking.
5,3 Way Touch Dimmer Switch,"I searched all over for this replacement switch for my entertainment center and Amazon was only place that had it. The cost was very reasonable. Actually, shipping was more than switch but it was deifinitely worth it. It took a couple minutes to install it and it works fine. It also arrived in only 2 or 3 days with standard shipping.Thanks Amazon..."
2,out dated,I wish they would revise this book a bit so it can be more useful. its very much out dated and can not help as much i would like it to in my line of business. we are now in the technological era now this book was written in the late 90's.
3,Pagoda building kit,"The book effectively is a building kit for making a paper pagoda. I was hoping to get more general information on building a pagoda, other than the instructions on how the stick the paper bits together. However, the paper pagoda is nice and the drawings do give me the right dimensions."
4,"Great songs, terrific video","""Jesus"" is a great single, matched by a spare, but mesmerizing video of Moz in priest regalia walking towards the camera, his band behind him. He's content to just walk and sing now, with few flourishes, and he knows that's fine with us. It's amazing just to stare at that face, troubled and yet content. The two B-sides are subdued and coldly pretty, ""Slum Mums"" being the more evocative."
4,A great source of shaping up options!,"For someone who is not physically fit at all, I thought I'd be intimidated by any literature that may even elude to working out. This book, with its helpful illustrations & detailed instructions, is a wonderful starting point for anyone trying to get into shape. It will take you step by step & explain why the steps are there in that order. Very helpful & valuable!"
2,"Lots of specifics, not much background","Lots of specific workouts, and specific topics like advice for pregnant women, those with arthritis, etc. Very little background or general topics, like how many reps is best, etc. It felt constraining. Also, virtually nothing on weight machines - the workouts use free weights only."
4,Pretty good,"The taste is pretty good, original flavor seems a little reminiscent of buttermilk. Some people may not like the texture but I thought it was fine. It's pretty light but only mildly crispy. They do contain some vegetables, though not a lot. The ones I received had an expiration date that wasn't very far in the future. I don't know if that's typical or if I just got unlucky. They seem to be going pretty fast in any case though."
1,Not worth the money,"Actually I would give this book 0 stars, but there is no way to do so. I've received free rose catalogs that have had better photos and more information than this book has. This book misses such vital information as winnings by the roses listed, scent ratings, sizes, etc. We own many of the roses listed in Rosa Rugosa and find that the author is misguided in her critiques of them. I can't recommend this book to anyone who loves roses unless they have money to throw away on books or simply can't find anything else to buy. If you want a really good book on roses, including much info on rugosas, buy Lois Hole's Roses."
4,The baby likes it.,The only thing to go by is what does the child pick up first. This is one of them.
3,Too hard for an 18-month-old,"Everyone doesn't agree, but I found this much too hard at 18 months for my now 27-month-old daughter. My review is probably based on the fact that I don't like this toy myself. It's very hard to fit pieces together - especially the ones that are spinning as you try to do it. My daughter just recently began enjoying it, and she does enjoy it very much."
2,not original equipment,"Received the item and it appears to be an aftermarket version of the original filter. There are 2 filters in the package that appear to be the ones listed, and 3 that are not. Very sketchy.The filters appear to be the right size...but the picture of the original packaging made me feel that's what I was buying, instead you get some grey wrapper stuff from uline.comnot returning it, but won't buy from them again."
4,screening of salt tolerant and drought resistant plants,This research aimed to screening of salt and drought resistant plant in saudi arabia to evaluate the effect of water of differant salinities and drought (irrigation intervals)on plant growth and performance in a sandy soil
2,UNessential is more like it.,first of i am down with G-funk but this is a very big let downnate do got skillz but this collection of 16 traks ant his best by far
3,Needs better description to be appreciated,"Although only 18"", this bag is big and can hold a lot of stuff.The bag is heavy, but thats because of the construction and materials. There are 3 outside pockets secured by velcro on one side. The other side has 3 open pockets. On the short sides, there are 2 pockets each, for a total of 4. THe 4 pcokets are openfaced.The cargo area is actually two separate places. There are two zippers for two different areas. Although the bottom is secured by velcro and can be opened, there is still a divider throughout the upper portions.One area has a sleeve for a drill and small removable tool pouch. The other area is just open space. There are no integral interior pockets.I like the length of the bag, but I am not sure aboutt he width. When opened fully, it looks like a square because it is so wide.I would have liked to have seen more interior pockets and exterior pockets that close."
5,Loved it!,"As a 60-something woman who camps alone and has had several doxies, how could I not love this book? But even without the elements I could relate to, it was a fun book to read. What a great character Maxie is. I've just purchased the second in the series and will no doubt read them all. Get this book!"
2,Agonizing,"I'll keep this brief, because even thinking about this book starts a sharp pain in my left temple. The prose is cumbersome, dwelling on trivial details that bring the pace to a lurching crawl. The characters' actions and motivations make little or no sense. Though rarely humorous, there are occasional moments of unintentional hilarity in which the main character lightly shrugs off death threats and attempted murder. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,The Serpents Trail,"As an avid mystery reader, I'm always on the lookout for good reads. The Serpents Trail began strongly with a lot of description and intrigue. As the story progressed, I became more interested. However the revealment was very disappointing - two paragraphs! It also left questions about the motivation of some of the characters - why was Sarah so reluctant to tell Ed the truth? Why was Alan so angry? More description than plot hurt the book."
2,elderly detective,"Boring. I am 60 years old, but i do not want to read about a senior citizen detective.Although I do like her description of the country and roads.Sue Henry is a great writer and I really enjoy her other books and have read them all!"
4,Don't wait too long to read this one.,"Ramsey Campbell is brilliant yet again. It a pleasure to read such a strongly written novel. Great plot, richly detailed characters and that overpowering sense of evil that only the very best can emanate from the page. Don't wait too long to read this one."
2,A distasteful thriller.,"I grew up both reading and loving Ramsey Campbell's dark hearted horror stories, and still do (Nazareth Hill is one of the all time great haunted house stories), but this suspense novel proved too much for me. A serial killer of children buries his victims in the houses he renovates for customers. The sympathetic main characters, who are unfortunate enough to own and still live in a property Woolie (the aforementioned killer) used to hide his latest victim, are beseiged by the usual hypocrites, know-it-alls, and inhumanly cruel villans one finds populating Campbell's books. As usual Campbell he makes the reader empathize with their suffering completely. But, as I said earlier, the book proved far too disturbing and discomforting for me. I just had to close it, get some fresh air, and read something else. A dip into darkness too many for me."
5,"Jump blues, at it's rockinest!","Talk about rockin' jump blues, these sides feature Watson's hot guitar riffs, and hsi appealing rough vocals, that sound so hip and cool! Most of the tracks feature plenty solo space for Watson's unique and creative and even improvisational playing, all the tracks, or at least most have big band backing, or at least a few wailin' horns in the background. this is a rollicking set, and swing dancers will love the livlier tracks, and even the laid back ones rock! Exellent cd, buy thsi along with 2 Hours Past Midnight, and The Very best Of..."
3,Into A Time Machine,"A particularly hip friend in Manhattan urged me to experience The Waitresses and their amazing bassist (Tracy Wormworth,sadly on only a few tunes) but I never trudged Westward to see them. This DVD,though it's audio and video quality is only fair, showcases the quirky talents of Chris Butler and Patty Donohue. I never suspected the Tin Huey connection (""Hump Day"") !"
3,Great songs and a good live performance,"""Waitresses: Live at Hurrah"" has great songs and a good live performance. I love The Waitresses but never before saw them perform live. This performance is okay and closely matches their studio album ""Wasn't Tomorrow Wonderful"". They do not do anything special above and beyond playing their songs, so they have no special stage presence or showmanship. They do play a few songs that are not on their album ""Wasn't Tomorrow Wonderful"". They do not play ""Christmas Wrapping"". The sound quality is okay and the video quality is mediocre. Why didn't the blasted camera man clean off the lens? Were smudges in style back then? Song writer Christ Butler introduces a few of the songs in a voice-over. It's bittersweet seeing the late Patty Donahue, as she smokes on stage, slowly giving herself the lung cancer that would kill her. There are no extras on the DVD. Reviewed 2/13/2009 after watching the DVD."
2,"Different, good, but different.","This CD is much different than their first CD, A Passage in Time. When I first lisetned to it, I noticed a much more punk sound, which doesn't suit them, although they did do it well. The songs are good, fun to listen to, but about half the cd is just lacking in quality compared to their previous album. This CD makes me miss the old sound, so I always have to listen to the previous CD after this one. They had more or a spanish sound in A Passage of Time and that is lost in Andiamo.If you're a fan, go buy it. You'll enjoy it.If you're new to them, I'd reccomend A Passage in Time. Must higher quality music."
5,awesome follow up,"this cd is just totally awesome for painted windows to rattlin' bog. the production is so much better and the guys true talents really shine. My favorite tracks are Thousand Years of War and Mexican Radio, although the whole disc is worth picking up."
4,a surprise find..for me that is,"i had heard someone tell me this band sounds like sublime. well about a month later i was looking at cds and found this album and decided what the heck..ill get it. i put this cd in and pretty much expected the average punk band of today(aka NOFX war on errorism style music). well i was shocked at how amazing this cd is for the music of today. the first 3 songs are great...the rest are good as well, usually cds drop off at the end. and yeah i say get this if your into bad religion, pennywise, sublime, against me! etc etc"
5,A shining light of inspiration!,"I found Ms Hellerbergs book when I was searching for guidance on how to discern meaning in my current stage of life. Her book was such an inspiration and provided - in clear language - how to "" let go and let God"" reveal that direction for me. I recommend this book without reservation to anyone that has questions about their life purpose, how to deal with life's challenges and to tap into the unique path that is theirs alone in this life. Thank you Ms Hellerberg for sharing your talents in support of others!"
2,Scratch DVD,"When i received this dvd collection I was excited to watch all dvd's. The new movie opened in my cinema and i wanted to show the story to my girlfriend, but first i wanted to see the only movie i havent seen, tokio drift. I started watching the movie and at half of it it stops, tried rewining it but at the very same second it stops. I checked the dvd and the thing was scratched. I just took this thing out of the box and out of that plastic wrap, theres no way that it could got scratch in the process. Very sad"
4,Great Combo DVD Set,"Everyone in the house has their fav when it comes to F&F. The first is the best in my book, My son is all over #2, my wife loves Tokyo Drift, and oddly enough my daughter loves the big Hemi Dodge in the last one. Get this combo pack and enjoy. What's' your fav F&F?"
1,rip off,these are very good movies but the price here is a big ripoff. I bought all 4 blu-ray movies at walmart.com for $36.00
4,Fast & Furious 4-Movie,I love cars and I like all of these movies and is such a good deal to get them all together.
3,Confusion.,The movies are great but two of them were labeled wrong. The disk that said tokyo drift was not tokyo drift.
2,"Great movies, bad product","The movies are good, or else I wouldn't have bought them. The problem is the product itself. The DVD's come in cheaply made cases that are bent and do not properly hold the DVD and the disks end up tumbling around in the case. Also, the DVD's don't match the cover. Example: in the ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" case was a DVD labeled as such. But when I put it in, Tokyo Drift was the actual movie on the disk. The only one that wasn't mis labeled was Fast and Furious."
5,For Beginners and Beyond...But Not Really,"Karen is a goddess in the world of wine. This book brings to life the [other] elements of wine that are as crucial to experiencing it as drinking. Still, misty mornings in the Sonoma Valley with the crack of roosters and tractors, the cuisine of Sauterne and the religious effects of Spain's national drink are just a taste of the emotions Karen brings to you in this education of wine. I've read a lot about wine, since it is my business. There are some other great reads out there. Speaking purely for reference sake, this is the book I do not leave home without. It's written in such impressionable fashion, that I rarely forget a quote. Through her emotional ties in travel, tasting, and living Karen has shaped my vision of wine and its effect on culture the world over. I can't remember the last time I gave 5-stars [for anything], but for $13.47 - there is no better buy on the subject. Cheers!"
4,The Wine Bible,"This is a nice Wine Book, However, it cannot compare to the latest Windows on the World Wine Course. Never the less, this is nice to have, and it can be had at a reasonable price."
3,Nice thick book,"I liked how big the book is, but it doesn't include the Temecula, CA wineries and that is where my family goes all the time."
3,"""Bible"" is perhaps a bit strong","The author has obviously a vast knowledge on her subject - I have certainly learned many things I didn't know. However she has great difficulties with consistent spelling of the numerous foreign names that are unavoidable in the world of wine. She especially seems to shy away from accented words, and instead of recognizing their value in pronouncing words, she treats them as decorations that can be dropped or added almost as an afterthought.I hope that a revised edition will correct this shortcoming."
5,Great comprehensive wine guide,This is a comprehensive guide about wine and wine regions of the world. It's a good book to have around as a resource. I'm glad I bought it.
4,Nice.,This is a great book. Loved all of the information. The best part is it tells you where to go (in the world) to find a certain kind of wine at the point of origin. Cool.
5,If you only have one wine reference book...,"...then this should be that book. Easy to read, well-written, colorful and full of informative sidebars, this book is one of the best entry-level wine texts available. Karen MacNeil manages to make a 900+ page book fun and easy to read by writing in a breezy, well-informed manner. Her book design allows the reader to pickup and put down the book often, without feeling like you've lost your place. The well-structured chapters flow easily and are very informative. I love this book because I can read it in bursts, a few pages at a time, and still learn more every time I pick the book up."
5,new book!,"Reviews said this book would have been used a bit, but it was brand new! Such a comprehensive educational book. Shipping was great- only 4 business days. Thanks so much!"
5,Fun and informative,Great learning device for those interested in reading about every aspect of wine. Well-written and highly recommended.
1,a general book,"I am a wine lover and i though this book would enhance my knowledge, but it did not. It is a general wine description book. The market has a lot more to offer."
4,Great but dated reference,This is a great reference and full of excellent information. It's major flaw is it's ten years old. The only constant is change. The wine world has improved by leaps and pounds in the last decade. The quality of wine and the knowledge to make that happen is expanding and spreading all over the world. The number of wineries has seen huge growth in the past ten years. Still a great reference.
5,My favorite wine reference book,I have amassed quite a collection of books about wine and this one always seems to provide me with the perfect amount of detail when I refer back to it. I have some intro books (windows on the world) that never tell me quite enough and some that are really long and provide too much information. I really recommend this book for anyone interested in wine and wine regions.
5,Great Book,"This is an awesome book. If you are getting into wine, or even if you already know quite a bit, this book is a must. Lays out just about everything you would want to know about every major wine producing region in the world. It is a great reference guide too, I always wish I had it in my pocket whenever I am in a wine shop, but sadly it's 900 pages and doesn't fit.Alder Yarrow, the author of the most popular wine blog in the world lists this book as ""Required reading for wine lovers."""
4,Fantastic!,"This book is awesome! I've heard nothing but good things about it, so I finally decided to buy it. All you need to know about wine! A great for me, a poor college student, to learn about the wine I love1"
5,Wine & Wine Grape Dictionary,"I own several wine books purported to give you all of the information on wines, but this is without doubt the best available. Definitely superior to Jancis Robinson's book. I have been unable to find any wine or wine region that is not covered. Buy it and you won't regret it."
2,Needs to be updated badly!!!,"This was a great book...6 years ago. While that might not seem a long time, remember that insane changes have occured lately: the restructuring of many Italian DOCs, promotion of massive numbers of Spanish DOs, new AVAs in California and Oregon, Canada establishing itself as a wine powerhouse for more than dessert wines, not to mention the stylistic change of Bordeaux after the 2000 vintage.I have also found several errors based on outdated (1997-1999) information. Though this is of little concern to novices, experts and those in the wine industry cannot rely on this information. Also, this needs to come in a hardcover form (for this many pages).Pros: value, basic knowledge goodCons: poorly laid out, outdated info, not durable, lacks advanced infoI know Karen MacNiel can do better, she is one of the most knowledgeable wine experts I have ever met."
4,A four only because I don't know much about wine... yet,"If I was an expert, of course, I could better ""rate"" this book - as an ignorant novice, I give it four.It's a thorough and interesting read - expanding on the different wine descriptors, practices and interesting histories, as well as highlighting the regions and wines for which they are famous. The author also gives specific wines and recommendations for pairing them with foods.I would certainly recommend this book to a novice - and I'm certain someone with a bit more experience could glean information from it, too."
5,Everyone happy,I sent this as a gift to a friend in the US; he was very happy with it. It arrived promptly.
4,Great Deal,"At nearly half the price of other online sources, this is an extremely good deal for the Conventional Brunton Compass. To my surprise, a case was also included at no extra charge. I have rated this item as four stars simply because I have not used it long enough to warrant 5, and the arm is made out of plastic, would prefer metal, but not sure if they even make it that way anymore."
1,LOOK! It's PLASTIC SURGERY BARBIE!!!,"Oh-my-GOSH. This is the MOST RETARDED THING I have EVER seen! I mean, her head is almost 2x as big as her body.....AND HER FEET COME OFF!!! And it doesn't help that she dresses like a hooker! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! BRATZ ARE E-V-I-L! Your brain will be mush! It will! BEWARE!!!"
4,Stress - Free : Peaceful Affirmations audio cassette,"This is a great tape. It is easy to listen to - Louise has a very calm and clear voice. It does what it says - on one side of the tape Louise repeats simple but positive affirmations over the top of soothing music, and on the other side there is just music mixed with sounds of nature, but there are subliminal messages which target your subconcious. I always fall asleep listening to the second side!!!!"
5,Excellent,This CD provides you the opportunity to release anger and resentment stored in your mind and heart. You bring peace and joy to your life once you allow yourself to release old memories and hurts.
3,Not bad,"Half of this disk is Louise hay giving positive comments,the other half is music,eventually the phrases get stuck in your head lol after a month of listening(which is the recommended amount of time) which is helpful I suppose."
3,NOT SO IMPRESSED,I love Louise Hay and was excited to try this cd. I am very disappointed-I have been using it for over three weeks and feel just as stressed as I did before using it---bummed because I expected it to really work-
3,"Works, but not for really heavy items.","Ok. Probably my own fault trying to use this little things on a really heavy washer. It does not scar floors, which is great. What I really need is a genie in a box who comes out and moves things for me."
2,Should be all one color,"These products work to help push heavy furniture across the hardwood floors. However, these do not look good under the furniture. They should be all one color, so that the buyer can choose either light or dark. We put in darker hardwood floors, so the beige part is very obvious and looks tacky. We ended up tearing them all off and buying something else that's all one color. We ordered so many and feel like we wasted all that money. To give the product some credit, they would work fine if the underside of your furniture is completely flat. Then you could stick them on a ways back and under, so the pads do not show."
5,These thing are great!,"I recently moved into an apartment with wood floors, and I needed something to protect my floors from my coffee table. These worked great. Has stayed on the feet for the coffee table for a while now, and slides across the floor smooth and silent. Definitely a good purchase for me."
3,Wish they were larger,"I bought a pack of these and a pack of the really large sliders for carpeting. I wish there were larger sliders for wood/pergo. I put 4 of these under my armoire (with a lot of difficulty as it has no feet) and it still wont move a milimeter. I'm sure they'll be ok for some other smaller pieces, but I am desperate to be able to move this armoire. Any suggestions would be appreciated."
1,these are awful--,"even if you're moving furniture across a wood floor (my situation) buy the sliders with the plastic bottom, which you can use and reuse."
4,Good to have,"Really haven't used these yet, but I think you can't have too many on hand for the time we'll need them."
3,pretty good,"I have respected some of the things that Mint Condition has done over the years.I ain't feeling the past couple of albums too much&I feel they are just playing it safe.but Live they still pack a Mean Puch. Stokley Williams the Leader&Drummer of the Band is a talented cat,who just didn't have that right song to truly showcase all he could be. Mint Condition is One of those bands that should have been better than what they put out. this album shows there skills as Musicians. Hit&Miss Songwriting. but this is a cool Album."
5,An Underrated BAND at their best,"Mint Conditio is without a doubt one of the best R&B BANDS of their time. I remeber back when I was eleven and first heard Pretty Brown Eyes which is still a timeless slow jam. All of the classic slow jams are on the CD from You Don't Have To Hurt, Is This Pain or Pleasure, I'm Ready ,What Kind Of Man Would I Be and my personal favorite Whoaa which echos back to Earth, Wind & Fire's Reasons. If you want to hear some real R&B then check this CD out."
1,PC Paintbrush,"I how lost some of the functionality of this old program and have been looking to reinstall it. I was happy to see this item for sale, however it won't install on my Win 7."
5,Awesome speakers,"These speakers are great. They sound great, are compact, great design and looks, and the controls are well laid out. On the right speaker is located the on/off button, volume adjustment, and subwoofer on/off for the subwoofer. The on/off and bass adjustment are also lighted, so you can see when they're on. These speakers have superior design to the ""cylinder"" speakers from Hannspree (I bought those as well) since the volume and subwoofer control is on a speaker and not the subwoofer as those other speakers have it. I'm amazed at how full the sound is- it doesn't sound directional at all, which is unusual in computer speakers like this. It definitely would work with an iPod to be a full sounding music set up. You'll either love or hate the modern design of the speakers. Personally, I love it. My wife still isn't sure. Definitely a unique item.For the money, these are great speakers. Highly recommended."
4,Nice product,"It's a nice product. However, I challenge anyone to let the 500 ft of string out on a kite and reel it back in :) If you plan on flying your kite high and do it often, invest in something that's hand crank or automatic. If you're just looking to go out and fly a kite twice every year at the beach, then this is perfect. The stock string that came with my $35 kite was not impressive, so this is a good investment still to me."
5,Great product,We bought this to go with another kite we purchased here and it worked exactly as intended. I was also easy for a 4 year old to manipulate so definitely a good product
3,Beware of photograph,"Beware of photograph as it is very misleading. I purchased four different kites. The photo description you see, as well as in the product description, ""Spools come in assorted colors"", leads you to believe (it did me anyway) that you will receive four spools. You will receive only one. This may not be a fair review of the product itself, as I have yet to use it, but I have written Amazon and feel the photo needs to be removed and replaced with one showing only a SINGLE spool of kite string, and not the four currently depicted. It is misleading."
4,Kite String - replacement line,"I thought this was a great product to use for replacement line for flying our kites.Good quality, good price."
1,Mysticism,"Though it is well written and contains some interesting ideas, this book is based on mysticism. If you are looking for a practical book to learn lucid dreaming techniques I don't recommend this one. That is, unless you don't mind wading through religous/mystic jargon in order to find useful tidbits. I suggest you check out ""Lucid Dreams in 30 Days"" instead."
3,GOOD REFERENCE GUIDE,"I SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED THIS BOOK BEFORE BUYING MY GRILL. IF I HAD, I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED A DIFFERENT KIND OF INDOOR GRILL. HUGE MISTAKE. BUT THE BOOK GIVES MUCH VALUABLE INFORMATION."
1,Amazon should have a closer look at their suppliers,"Any close to expiry date product display should be avoided.I was misslead and bought a three months supply of berry green with a 2 weaks expiry date.I had to throw it away, wasted my time and money."
2,"Good product, tastes awful",I bought this to supplement my nutritional needs. Tried it and it tastes pretty bad. Hopefully I'll either get used to it or be able to choke it down.
3,"Good deal, but not best value","It is a good blade at the start. But after several board feet of book match cuts on 6"" soft maple, I can feel that it does not want to cut anymore. It is still good for 3/4"" cuts, but book matching -- not. I would go with carbide tipped and probably narrower than 3/4"" to get less friction and save the time and hassle to replace blades."
1,DON'T BUY!,"This product is just glorified modelling clay, but more plasticy(?). It is IMPOSSIBLE to knead, even for an adult, let alone a child. The molds don't work, and overall a VERY frustrating project. It took a Herculean amount of patience to keep from pitching it across the room!!!"
1,Doesn't do what it's suppose to,I agree with the other reviewer. We were very disappointed with this toy. It doesn't do what it is suppose to. You can't knead the substance and make it into anything. We tried several approaches and let it soak way longer than recommended in the directions and it was very hard and we couldn't even use it. The only part of it that was as advertised was that it changed colors but that certainly isn't worth the money.A complete waste of money.
3,decent replacement,"This is a nice, but not perfect replacement for a 1995 GMC Jimmy. The bolts are much narrower than the originals and don't come with the matching nuts. You also end up with a slightly larger gap between the mounting base and the door. I reused the rubber gasket from the old mirror because this mirror only comes with a flimsy piece of foam. All this being said, the mirror still looks good and works, so it's about right for the money."
2,Buy something else!,"I installed this mirror on a 2004 Buick LeSabre on the drivers side door. I had no installation problems at all, and it looked good. About two weeks ago I noticed that the mirror has two separate vertical cracks in it, and for no apparent reason other then it has to be made with junk. Now the glass is falling out! It doesn't show any signs that it was hit or anything, there are no dents or scuff marks of any kind on the painted area of the mirror. It's too bad because it did look, but now I have to buy another mirror, but it won't be from this company again!!"
5,I love Amazon!,"I almost bought this book in a book store on Balboa Island. Then my friend said to get it on Amazon - I didn't realize it could be brand new! Saved alot of money and the book is amazing. It arrived in the mail quickly, so I am now a devoted fan. If you love Palm Springs like we do, you'd love reading Palm Springs Weekend."
2,Fair or fowl?,"I am glad that you stated up front that it was hard for you to write the story until you took sides. It was obvious! When a Tewksbury was killed in your book it usually took less than a paragraph to tell. When a Graham was killed you wrote all the gory details. I for one would like to read a balanced, not bias account of this infamous account in Arizona's history."
3,Lee Hanchett's Graham-Tewksbury Feud Account,"This is the most complete account I have read. Was disturbed through much of the book by the assumptions he makes based on very little data.... his favoring the underdog, the Grahams, is obvious but he announces and tries to justify that fact up front. Irregardless he seems to have presented a more complete and accurate account of documented and meaningful facts than the other two accounts that I have read. The significant value of Lee's presentation in my opinion is the research he has done on the money trail...and the implications that result from his emphasis on the money influence The implication seems to be that both the Tewksburys and the Grahams became pawns of the Dags and their power influence; that both families played out their feelings and bitterness against each other, and in the case of the Tewksburys, those feelings and actions were fanned by the available money and political influence provided by the Dags."
3,Title should be revised,"This may be useful to students or someone who is a freelancer. The book really lacks detail. It provides information but right when you need more info, it stops. So I would suggest the book to be renamed ""Introduction to Interior Design Business"". That's more accurate."
3,"Fine, But!","Hello, I recieved this new reprinted version of this bookon very thin weight paper and a totally black cover withno lettering on the front. The title is only on the spine.If this was mentioned in the ad I did not see it.Thanks for asking,DJQuick"
5,Great Book!!!,I thought Aftermath was wonderful. I usually greatly dislike anything from the Iowa workshop people but Shawver is fantastic!
5,good,very interesting book. a bit hard to read if you don't understand the language but some very nice metaphors used.
5,Generating Passion for Typography,"My friends give me a hard time becuase they have found me on more than one occasion reading this book at weird times. I read it in the bathroom. I read it instead of working on papers for my elective classes. This book stimulates me to design and create. It ignited and continues to kindle the passion for design and typography that burns inside me. If you've read Strunk and White's Elements of Style (for grammar) and enjoyed it, and are a designer then this book is for you. One of the best references I have. The author's passion for typography is clear, and it has inspired my passion as well.The only down side is the serious and heavy attitude. You really have to know about what you are reading. This certainly is for the serious and knowledgable designer."
3,packed full of info- but a huge read,"This book has tons of great information, but is massive, and very tough to hunt through for specific information."
3,Not what I expected...,"After quickly scanning the reviews of this book, I was under quite a different assumption about what this book would explain and teach. I read that 'this should be required reading', but it's so boring I haven't gotten past a few pages. I'm going to try and pick it up again and get into it, but for a book on typography, it's not really what I expected. I'm dissappointed."
2,Type History not Examples,"This book makes it sound like it's going to tell you how to make unique typography. However, it just tells you the history of type and typographical styles. In my opinion unless you are taking a class on the history of type this book is not useful for any other purpose."
3,Say What?,"Typophiles will eat this book up; however beginning and even seasoned designers might have troubles with this book. For one, it's all text. Hardly any diagrams or visual examples to be had. Are you kidding me? One of my crazy design teachers once said ""If a book doesn't have pictures then don't read it!"". I'm beginning to believe her. It's like reading the directions for the VCR and just as dry. If you've read any of Ellen Lupton's DIY books, then ""The Elements of Typographic Style"" has to be the anti-thesis.But like most things that are good for you (spinach, brushing your teeth, exercising) it's hard to get through at first. After a couple reads I imagine this book to be more useful. For now I'll keep it in my ""to-finish"" pile. Check out the ""Elements"" website to see if this book is for you."
4,A thick Read,"A great reference book to have for any designer, although a little tedious at times a solid read with a great historical overview of the subject. I would definitely recommend to any enthusiastic designer with a thirst for knowledge on things Typographical.Since reading, I have become more critical of Typography in general and it works as a great guide when in doubt."
5,Dr Mary Edwards Walker,Dr Snyder did an excellent book on Mary and many articles written about her it is used as the basics. She is an American ICON.
2,TEDIOUS ROUTINE!!!!!!!!!!,"Freeman Wills Crofts is an author who belongs to the realist school of detective fiction. Alibis, time tables and physical evidence feature prominently in his novels. Following of usual detective routine is also a major future of realist school of detective fiction which is present in this novel. Nothing is striking about this novel the first part of the novel is quite interesting as French struggles to find the means of committing a crime in a locked room. From the first deductions about the method of the murder the story turns into a very boring routine detective work nothing brilliant or shining is done by detective French he even chooses the wrong suspect and arrives at the solution by being told not by deducing logically or guessing theoretically. This is a disappointment as there is nothing in the book which qualifies as good whodunit .The characterizations are lame as well. If you are looking for a good mystery you can do better than to pick this book up."
1,CREATIONIST DRIVEL!!!!!!,This book is pure garbage. Creationist drivel. It is amazing how men who claim to be Christians can misquote other people. Either they are dishonest or don't know how to read science writers. They enjoy trying to make evolutionist seem like they doubt their own theory. I have read many books on evolution and do not see any doubt. However I do read of disagreements about certain aspects of evolution. What these two evangelical hacks have done is lift quotes out of context to make their case sound stronger. I imagine if one had the time to devote themselves to a useless project he could lift quotes out of young earth creationists books and Intelligent Design writers and make them sound like they deny the faith. But that would be pointless. Evolution is not in doubt and the Bible Cosmology IS NOT science. It is Bronze Age myth!!!!
1,Balderdash,"This is diatribe taken to the lowest level. Not worth reading.No one with a wit of scientific education will be amused by thiscrude attempt to convert superstition and myth to the level ofscience. The sad thing is that Morris has a following, but sodid Jones."
2,Shortest book in the world,"This should be the shortest book ever published. The answer to ""What is creation science?"" is two words: ""Not science.""What does it tell you when there is a grammatical error in the blurb? Another example of the philosophy manufactured by monied elites in the U.S. to promote a narrow political view in order to keep those very elites in power."
2,Good product but does not hold up good,"I bought this product 6 months ago, I came home from work one day when no one else was home & I found the canopy collapsed inside the Pack n Play. It somehow on its own snapped & broke apart. I kept the product indoors in a cool environment. I do not understand how this could happen. It was great for the 6 months it lasted. But not the best buy for the money if it only lasts 6 months."
3,Its ok. Bad quality.,"I have had the canopy for 2 weeks...used it twice and already the plastic white bar that stablized the front arch has broken (in 4 places). I was going to order a replacement bar but decided to just buy a piece of PVC pipe and it works sooo much better!! Oh and did I mention it was about a buck... Anyways would recommend the canopy but just know when you get it be prepared to make some ""alterations""."
3,needed to be designed better,I purchased this item and was not as impressed as I hoped that I would be. It didn't fit my playyard as it said it would and it blows off a lot. The idea is great but you need to come up with ideas to secure the product better because the clips are a joke. More thought from the company is needed to make it more successful.
3,Keeps the sun out but broke after one use!,"This product does keep the sun out; however, the rod that holds it up broke after one use. Luckily my husband was able to buy materials and make a new one, but it was a big inconvenience."
1,Didn't fit right and wasn't worth it.,It wasn't meant for the rounded ends of my PnP but it fit in an ugly way anyway. We used it twice maybe. It just wasn't feasible.. not as much as I thought it would be.I would save the money and just keep the child out of the sun.
4,For Those With Long Arms,"This is a very nice robe, though a bit heavy for the summer months. However, it should serve nicely on cold winter nights. It has a very generous cut so unless you are very large in statue or quite abundant around the midsection, the medium/large should fit you quite nicely. My only complaint is that the sleeves are very long, covering my hands and then some. Having never owned one, perhaps this is how ""spa"" robes are supposed to be. Nevertheless, since my knuckles don't drag the ground, I had my wife shorten the sleeves more to my fit and liking. Otherwise, I'd have had to roll them up and expose a seem just to hold a knife and fork."
1,Not what I expected,"Because the name of the robe states it is a ""terry"" robe I presumed I would be able to use it as a bath robe after showering. However the material it is made out of has a very strange texure and does not appear to be absorbant at all. I returned the robe."
1,How do College's get away with this!?,"This is a book written by a professor at Ohio University, and it is a required course for Media studies students. He is the only professor who teaches it and of course you are required to use this book. What's even worse is even in it's fifth edition the book is FULL of typos and grammar errors.From the 4th to the 5th edition alone, these typos still have not been corrected, and actually the figures don't add up with the chapters. The book sells for over $100 and is nearly impossible to find used. Shame on Ohio University for allowing this to go on for over 20 years. Absolutely horrible book. Save you're money. Borrow a friends copy of check one out from the library.Btw he doesn't even explain the concepts in a legible way. I've talked to plenty of people in the electronics industry who say McDanniel's definitions and explanations aren't even close to being right, let alone learn-able."
3,Fourth Edition and still Typos. Unprofessional.,"I have the 4th edition of this book, it is usually a very expensive book. That is not a big deal to certain people.If the book is good and deemed worth the value I would understand.This book is full of typos, mis-spellings and wrong figure #s for the charts.In the fifth edition which some of my classmates have, this has not been corrected either. Some of them payed over 100 dollars for the book.To make matters worst, it is a cheaply made spiral bound book and the all pictures and text are black and white.It is unprofessional on the first edition, much less the fifth edition to have all of these flaws and still charge so much for this book.If you can buy it on the cheap, do so...don't waste your money on the newer edition, you are missing almost nothing until the last couple of chapters."
5,Love Love Love it!,"I ordered this ring for myself as an after tax season reward. I kept looking at the website and finally ordered it, and boy am I glad I did. The colors are fabulous and I haven't had a hard time adjusting it. My only problem - my 21 year old daughter also fell in love with it, so now I may have to order another. You will not be disappointed in the colors or the design of this gorgeous ring!"
2,not like photo,"I read all these great reviews about this ring and it looks good in the photo. When I received it, well, it looks kind of cheap -- like a toy almost. I was not really happy with it at all. It's ok but not like the photo"
5,Beautiful Ring,"I bought this ring as a birthday gift and it is so beautiful. It looked like it was going to be a bit bulky, but when put on, it really isn't. The person I bought it for just loves it and it looks much more expensive than it really it is. Great buy!"
5,great deal,"Great deal. I bought this for my wife, it was better than the picture. She loves it, wears it all the time."
1,displeased!,I rec the ring as a Christmas gift and fell in love with it. It is sterling silver and I keep it polished. It seemd everyday it is tarnished!
2,Pretty but fragle,At first I really enjoyed this ring but it only lasted a couple of day and then the stone chipped. It is not wearable now.
4,So pretty!,"Very nice ring. Stones are just as pretty as they look online. Bought it as a gift, and she loves it"
4,"Eyecatching, really",This ring is visually stunning. I haven't come to 100% terms with it yet because it so different than any piece of jewelry that I own. It is really very colorful and large but very intriguing at the same time. I have only had it two days but I think I am going to end up falling in love with it. The quality of the piece is excellent. Ian and Valeri's customer service is amazing. Fedex smartpost shipping is not the best option if you want your merchandise fast but the seller really stepped up to plate to make this order right for me!
4,Overall very pleased with ring,"As other reviewers have noted, the ring has a rather wide band. Almost like wearing a key ring. Knowing in advance that it was on the wide width side before I bought it, I wasn't suprised and didn't mind the width when it showed up. Arrived in a plain red jewlry box with black foam interior. Nice enough for giving as a gift. The ring itself is very pretty. I think the amber nuggets look a bit plastic but that is the nature of amber especially in small nuggets. Overall I am very satisfied with the ring and will be buying some of the additional pieces the seller who provides this ring also offers on Amazon."
3,The thick band ruins the look,I bought this ring a year ago. The design is pretty unique and attractive. You won't be wrong with size because the band adjusts easily. I'd love it if the band would be thinner. The thick round band ruins the impression from this ring and makes wearing it uncomfortable. I still wear it occasionally because the ring matches almost any clothes.
3,loved it but....,I really loved it when i got it....but the green stone fell out after just one nite out and i can not find a stone to replace it...to bad was pretty and bold......
5,very adjustable,"I ordered this as a thumb ring, and it's easy to (carefully)squeeze down and elongate to use as a forefinger ring. Band IS bulky, but ring is eye-catching.PS. Great customer service!"
5,positive feedback,"Excellent seller!! Fast transaction. Beautiful product! Exactly as described. Thank you so much, will buy again"
5,Amber,Certified Genuine Multicolor Amber and Sterling Silver Adjustable Designer RingThis ring is very well made. It is absolutely stunning and very unique. I've never seen anything like it!
5,Corporate Avenger--Freedom is a State of Mind,"This is the best band in the entire world!!!! They may look a bit scary, and sound angry, but they are such nice guys...if you're into heavy metal, or death metal or anything like that...and you arent religious, then you should definetly check these guys out!!!!!!! If you are a religious person, or homosexual or anything like that...then please...dont listen to this music because they might offend you. All in all...this is the best band in the world, and i love them!!!!!!!!"
5,Are you ready to question your past?,"Corporate Avenger tell it like it is. With songs such as ""Christians Murdered Indians"", ""Fault the Police(I Don't)"", and ""FBI file"", they delve into the dark history of this country and bring it to light. So if you're ready for a history lesson from the land of the Cherokee then buy this album now."
2,GOOD MUSIC BUT DESTRUCTIVE ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA,"The album's got really catchy tunes, but if this anti-American bs propaganda keeps growing within our own country, we're going to loose the freedoms we have. This bs of showing support for revolution by wearing Che Guevarra is the exact same bs these guys are preaching against. Che and the Cuban government are up there with the absolute most oppressive regimes in existence. Go ahead and research how ""freedom"" or freedom of speech is doing in Cuba these days. Oh yeah, ""real freedom by way of revolution"", that's the ticket.Be careful what you fight for, you just might get it.God Bless the US and the rights it affords us. You don't know what you got till it's gone.Peace,jv"
3,Why did they do this?,7 of the songs on this CD are already on The New Testament so I'm not shelling out another 14$ for it but they are a great band I just wish they would have put more new stuff on this.
4,honesty is the best policy,These guys are honest to say the least- if you're open minded and really need to push the limits of what society wants to hear-this is the cd for you!
4,Excellent devotional style read!,I am excited about 40 Days to Faith by Jack Coe. This book has been an excellent tool for daily and weekly devotions. I am learning a lot and am using each chapter in my weekly studies.Jack Coe gives a lot of inspiration and information.
2,Primarily a Survey,"I was disappointed. The author is a well known authority on the Civil War, but I found this to me primarily a chaapter by chapter chronolgical survey of the Civil War built around a description of the strategy. Turning movements, concentration in time and space, raids -- I didn't think this book added much to the discussion."
5,"An inspiring, helpful and refreshing read!","Jill and Cyndi have provided us with an easy-to-read and easy-to-follow guide that just about anyone can put to use! Anyone and probably EVERYONE can relate to this book, whether you a recent graduate, a CEO, unemployed, retired or just looking for something to read! With all of the formulas and tips they provide, there is inevitably something for everyone! It's Your Move makes you feel good about yourself and it makes you want to go out there and do something great with your life!!"
5,It makes you think,I thought this was a great book. It was full of wonderful ideas that really got me thinking. We know the best answer for ourselves as we make choices in life but we just have to see it all in a different light. This book forces you to look deeper into ourselves and have the confidence to take that move.I will never look at a problem or opportunity the same way again.
1,Not Decaf Hazelnut Cream,"I ordered two boxes of Decaf Hazelnut Cream and Amazon said it would come from Cups of Joy. Well what I got was plain old Decaf Hazelnut, not Hazelnut CREAM and I had already ordered Decaf Hazelnut from Amazon, so I ended up with 4 boxes of plain old Decaf Hazelnut. I complained but no one did a thing about it. If I had know that, I sure would of not ordered it. So I not happy with Amazon at all for false advertising."
2,Bostonian Men's Helios Slip-on Disappointment :-(,"I travel a lot, and was hoping to have a stylish shoe that I can wear travelling and attending meetings the convenience of Slip-ON to go through the air port security.These Helios are not the same as I saw in the local Macy's store, the heal is extremely loud when walking it makes a loud noise. Still breaking in the show, but expected to use it for everyday work, most likely not an everyday work shoe. It is not as comfortable as I thought for it to be."
1,Sent wrong product to me the first two times,"This is the second time I ordered this product and received the wrong one and had to return it. This has to do with the company, not the product."
2,So boring,"I'm a pretty big fan of AIR's music - this was terribly disappointing. Things never really take off or go anywhere. It's mellow - which is fine - but not when it's boring. The production is nice, though. I read somewhere that this music was left over from a soundtrack project they were working on. I hope so - it's be a shame to lose them to mediocrity."
4,SURE CURE FOR STRESS - A MUSICAL MOOD ELEVATOR,"Tough day at home with the kids or on the job? Air's latest CD ""Pocket Symphony"" will work better than a good stiff drink to take off that edge. Put your headphones on, close your eyes and just RELAX. Sedate but never a sedative, Air has managed to evolve into a New Age band for a New Century. The music is calming but always manages something instrumentally interesting to keep your mind involved whether it is the Latin percussion of ""Space Maker,"" the Japanese flavors of ""Once Upon A Time"" and ""Mer Du Japon,"" the sparseness of ""Lost Message"" or the cascading piano of ""Mayfair Song."" Air supplements it's lovely instrumentals with vocals that ehance the music, engage the ear while never becoming intrusive enough to spoil the mood.In fact Air has even included a song which describes the CD to a tee. It's called ""Somewhere Between Waking And Sleeping"" and it and the remainder of the songs are the tasty sonic equivalent of your cooldown at the gym."
4,The best chill cd around,"I started to listen to Air around Moon Safari and have always loved their electronic pop. This album however is different and not for everyone, even some Air fans. It is very mellow and relaxed, however if you are patient and just relax and enjoy this music it is great fill music. I listened to this all last summer and the summer before, I plan to do the same this summer. It is great to listen to with the wind blowing in your hair, or laying out in the sun, that put me to sleep. The truth is it is rather boring, but not everything is Coldplay or Spoon, not everything has to be catchy music. Music can produce many different feelings and atmospheres we do not need to limit to music that gets us dancing or singing. Air produced a very mature album and I hope they continue to create great albums."
4,I'm still getting used to it!!,"It is different indeed, if you start comparing it with MOON SAFARI or TALKIE WALKIE (a master piece by the way) you will find several differences. So far I can say that I've enjoyed it, but i definitively have to get used to it. Let me tell you that ONCE UPON A TIME has the sensibility that only AIR can transmit. It's amazing!"
4,Fine Ambient Pop - also try William Orbit,"This is as advertised, a ""pocket symphony"" - more instrumental and ambient than than the more upbeat pop of Talkie Walky which is wonderful -- though that last does get some eye-rolls from friends on ""Surfing on a Rocket""... this breezes by.If you like this, you will LOVE William Orbit ""Hello Waveforms"", which is my favourite album of the 2000s so far..."
4,Pleasant,Air have managed to produce quite a good collection of modern electronica here. While it is more on the athmosphreic side (as usual) there are some interesting tracks. The opener Spa Maker is a melodic numebr with guitars that would not seem out of place on Davis Sylvian's first album. Mer du Japon has the same pulsating bass and drum backing that YMO had and is probably a homage to them. Otherwise this is a quiet and beautifully produces album of acoustically sounding electronica (if that is possible). It is a nice even if very derivative effort.
5,absolute geniuses,"these guys are what they are... air.... if you like any thing they put out, youll love it. nice chillout"
5,Best of 2007: Grows on you,"I am happy with ""Pocket Symphony"". With their 2007 comeback album, the French duo has managed to combine their sound from ""Talkie Walkie"" with their earlier work, yielding an album that has a crisp electronic sound hovering lush ambient soundscapes in the best Air style ever.Now, I must admit the first listen to it didn't quite sink in, and there are still (after numerous listens) tracks that I don't enjoy too much (""One Hell of a Party"" and ""Napalm Love"" being the top two). But the rest of the album has so many GREAT moments that it is bound to offer listeners music for the ages. The opening and closing tracks are two such cases, which are among the best music to come out in 2007."
2,Didn't sink in,"I just never really got grabbed by this album. Other than Mer du Japon, the songs were way to atmospheric. Some of Air's songs really grab me, but many don't. Nothing ""catchy"", but I can tell from the other reviews, many are quite happy with this.:)"
4,Pocket Symphony; CD may be the wrong medium for you.,"I have owned Pocket Symphony on CD for about 2 months now, and I have given it many listens. The first track to make itself noticed was Napalm Love, having an exotic appeal. I could have lied to myself and said that it was their best album at the time, but I didn't truely believe it, but now I know. The beauty lies deeper, much deeper, in fact it is very hard for me to access the true substance of the album on CD. I urge all of you who are either about to buy the album, or have already purchased the CD to buy the vinyl. Pocket Symphony could easily be compressed and fit onto one record, but it isn't. Air split up the album into 4-sides (2 records) which allows for the most open, ambient sounds. The bass sound is very open clear, when heard on the right medium, you'll NEVER go back. The vinyl has COMPLETELY changed the way I listen to Pocket Symphony, which by the way is a masterpiece! I give the CD 4 stars, but the vinyl 5!!!!"
2,Drab,This album is very drab and downtempo. It would have been better if it rocked more like their previous albums. Air needs to rock more.
1,Record Label Ruins Product,"I bought this CD took it home and put it in my computer to dump it to my iPod and was surprised to find out my PC didn't even see the disk. I tried it on other computers in the house and it wouldn't see it at all. I immediately returned the disk and got a refund. The copy protections on this disk make it impossible to use the music the way I want to in my own home. I believe this is the record label messing with an artist's work. I love Air, but I hate this miserable attempt to control my access to the music."
1,One Good Track,"I overheard the cut ""Night Sight"" while in (not mentioning rival brick-and-mortar book store), and fell instantly in love. It's the sort of dreamy, trippy, ""ambient""-style of music that I can't get enough of. Purchased the disc and discovered the rest of the tracks were... let's use the word ""disappointing,"" as I'm sure some folks must have liked this stuff. This is before I started discovering the buy-a-single-track feature that many (most?) discs have available. My most sincere compliments to the artists, and please consider an album of more of this style of music -- you've clearly the talent for it, and we're losing a lot of great composers of ambient. Fill the gap!"
1,Oh dear,I was hoping for some more of the same fluent funky yet sultry smooth jazz but unfortunately got a bunch of pots and pans being banged together. I tried listening to it a dozen times but couldn't bear myself to listen any more. I have since disposed of the CD. What a shame.
4,No Problems,Product received as requested and on time. No problems at all. It's a Christmas gift so it hasn't been used yet but it looks pretty sturdy.
3,very pricey for what it does,"the 8"" silicone leaves rings on my blue stone counter top when hot or heavy pots are put on it."
4,Nice but small!,"Received in the mail today, it's smaller in circumference than what I expected, but still adequate in size for my small pots and platters, and the mat is definitely thick enough to protect my bench top and table against scorching and heat marks. The quality of the silicone is excellent."
2,"Once burned, twice angry","The hole on this potholder is positioned to ensure that I burn the tip of a finger every other time I use it. Unless I stare at the potholder instead of, say, the loaf pan I am removing from the oven, the act of moving the holder to get a better grip makes it likely that I will shift the hole and burn a finger."
5,LOVE IT!,I love these. There are so many uses for these things I never even thought of. They withstand high temperatures and match the Le Creuset kiwi products really well. I am planning on getting more for myself and maybe even some more more x-mas gifts!
2,"Very Good TV, when it works.","My unit, which I bought from Amazon, had a whole bunch of problems. Out of the box, it has two bad pixels. One is always orange, the other one is always greenish. They are quite noticeable. It sucks to pay 2k+ for a screen that is flawed. When channel surfing with this thing, it occasionally resets itself; turns itself off and then back on. The biggest problem with my tv is that once a while it can't be turn on. The power light and OPC light would flash on and off, pressing the power button on the remote and the set won't turn it on. I would have to unplugg the power cord and then plug it back in for this thing to work again. When it works, the picture quality and black levels are very good. I've contacted Sharp customer service. We have not reached a solution yet."
3,TV shuts off while watching then turns back on.,I have the same problem as the first reviewer. I didn't purchase the TV my dad did. So I don't know if I can get repaired. Picture looks great while it is on.
4,Problem with remote,"I agree with other reviewers that this set is excellent for viewing. In the last few months, though, we've started having problems with the remote. When the set is first turned on only the on/off feature will work for about five minutes from ten feet away. When we move to within a couple feet the remaining features start working, and after the short wait period. We've changed the batteries several times and made sure the send and receive ports are not blocked to no avail. We've had the set just over a year and no other problems. We've no children or pets that chew on these things. I just emailed Sharp customer service describing the problem and haven't heard anything back. One way to troubleshoot this would be to buy a universal remote and see if it works any different. So far the nuisance factor hasn't driven us to do anything else. I'm prompted to write this because several reviewers noted what seems to be a remote control problem."
2,not the real thing!,"I nay have liked this product better if I had not seen the real thing. I have seen many rasta'a and spent a considerable amount of time on the internet trying to find them. I have owned the ones that are hand made and I wish that I could find them again. The ladies on Maui make them, and they are gorgeous! The yarn is heavy, and the knitting is spectacular. They are large because most people that wear them, wear them over braids or afros. I would love to send you one so that you could see what they should look like. They would fit a toddler's head, (a bald-headed toddler)but nothing larger. I hope that I can return them, but what I would really like is to find where I can get the real deal. The colors are nice, but they are very cheaply made. Size, material, and workmanship get a thumbs dowm. My friends complemented mine, so I ordered 8 of them as surprise gifts. They were a surprise alright!"
2,"Good, but way too small","The beanie is good colors and nice, but it's way too small. And they advertise that it will insulate-there is no way it would ever do any good for warmth."
3,beanie is a tad on the small side,I purchased this item for my son for Christmas and tried it out when I received it. the quality of the net seems good but it is not by any means a 1 size fits all. I would think it would fit a smaller person and or small head size as it gave me a headache from the pressure of being too tight. I think the product would be better if some elastic were used in the threading. Other than that it seems like a good product. And if I need to buy something like this for a child I would buy again.
4,Rasta beanie,"Colorful and well constructed. Haven't had it out in the rain or snow yet so don't know whether it will shrink. It was a little on the small side,and I don't like a hat that fits tightly. Better suited for a young person rather than an adult with a full head of hair. It is very colorful."
3,Hand Crocheted Beanie (02)-Rasta,"Bought this as a gift for my daughter. She lost her old Rasta beanie and wanted a new one. This item is very nicely made, but it runs very small. She had a hard time getting it on her whole head, we are hoping it will stretch over time. If it does, I will update rating."
2,Xmas present,"I thought it was going to be able to fit an adult, but that was not the case. It was way to small and I had to give it to my little cousin instead!"
1,well i dont know what to say,"I got this in the mail...shipped in a timely manner no prob there, but when i got it...it was so small, so i gave it to my 6 year old. tiny, very small"
1,Never got it,"I never got it at all, so how am i suppose to review on something i haven't got i've been waiting for it since last month and i haven't gotten it at all"
2,kinda small,hat is good but only if you have an abnormally small head..its extrmemly tight and prolly shoulg be recommend for little kids
5,Thought Provoking.,"I have read the angelwalk series..and I can still remember the feeling of awe...as thoughts and ideas were sparked by Roger Elwoods words and his way of pointing out things in our Culture and in the world around us that I had never thought about before.He opened My eyes to emotions and led My mind to brainstorming and re-evaluating circumstances and ""political"" at times; issues that I had once thought I was solute on. He inspired the most sincere inner look at My own christian philosophy..and with such ease..I am a devout christian..and I assure You..that his words opened My eyes..I would recommend this series of books to anyone who wants to take an inner look at themselves."
5,WAKE UP CALL,"THIS BOOK IS TRULY A GREAT PIECE OF CHRISTIAN FICTION. IT ANSWERS THE QUESTION IF SATAN HAS ANY POWER ON THE EARTH.IT ALSO SHOWS THAT GOD IS A FAIR GOD AND TRUE TO GOD'S WORD,HE LEAVES IT UP TO THE PERSON TO DECIDE WHAT THEIR DECISON WILL BE.THERE HAVE BEEN ALOT OF BOOKS THAT TALK ABOUT WHAT THE ANGELS MAY BE THINKING.IN MY OPINION,ANGELWALK MAY BE ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS THAT ADRESSES THE SUJECT.IF YOU LIKED ANGELWALK THEN YOU WOULD LOVE THE BOOK CALLED THE GLIMMERING MASK. IF YOU READ THIS BOOK ,E-MAIL ME AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT."
1,This is Christian fiction???,"I was completely horified at some of the things I read in this book. There were such unbelievable stereotypes in this book that kept me reading just to find out if at some point Elwood would somehow appologize! I am extremely disappointed that this is labeled Christian fiction. Jesus love for people all over the world is not apparent anywhere in this book, rather it is filled with hatred for anyone different."
1,Eric Rudolph as Author,"The stench of brimstone is coming from these books, but the source is not the characters, it is the author. His intense, vitriolic hatred and contempt for people is astonishing. If you are looking for spiritually uplifting fiction, you'd be better off reading a slasher novel on the bestseller list. If you are looking for evidence that many evangelical Christians hate and reject the teachings of Jesus, look no farther. If Eric Rudolph, the Olympic Park bomber wrote novels, he would write novels like this...."
1,What a joke,"I am not convinced. Karl Popper did more with the lint in his pocketfor science then Christianity ever did. Yes this is a horrible review, but I am done waisting my time with this book."
2,perilous journey,"unfortunately, the awkward writing gets in the way of what is a remarkable story. Kris Stoever must be trying to convince herself that she is an author but she didn't convince me."
1,Spaced out details,"This is one of the most poorly written books I have read in quite some time. The way it hop, skips, jumps from one part of their lives to the next and back again is confusing. Not one of the children is introduced at their birth by their name and date of birth. In fact in one paragraph, Rene is said to be 4 months pregnant and two paragraphs later it states ""Rene and the baby arrived."" What baby? Boy or girl? It never says. Later you read that six-month old Timmy died in his sleep. First time you ever hear the kid's name and was he the new baby or the first born? Very confusing. Too bad they didn't have a good editor because I got so annoyed that I gave up. But then again, when growing up in the US in the 60's I had absolutely no interest in the space program (still don't) so maybe that was part of it."
3,Interesting history of NY,"If you're into history of NY this is an intersting book, politics and money wins all."
5,Excellent melodic black metal,"In my opinion, this is their best album, I also find with a lot of bands I like the first 1 or 2 albums most. These guys are really in a class of their own, and compete well with the likes of ebony tears, Dimmu borgir, and Cradle of Filth. The Norwegian lyrics really adds to the mood as well. Worth every cent. The actual recording quality is soft, and could be better."
2,Almost wonderful...,"This band really has what it takes to perform beautiful and gloomy music, but the machine-gun speed-metal drumming that they insist on inserting into every song ruins the whole thing."
5,great product,"I got these a little over 2-3 weeks ago for my 2003 Toyota Tundra,Access Cab, and so far i love them. I live in an area where the rain/snow can be pretty unpredictable and these are perfect to have on a hot day that might have rain showers in the forecast. The instal took me less than 5 minutes for each visor and made my truck look great. these are also great for people who like to keep their windows open as they drive, the wind doesn't blow in nearly as hard as it does without the visors. I have also noticed that even with the windows closed, after a good 4-6 hours of sitting in direct sunlight the interior actually feels slightly cooler. I have also found that since i added them i have actually had a slight increase in gas mileage (via a gas mileage tracking app). These visors are definitely worth it."
4,Window Ventshade,Items were good quality and value. One ventshade had a finger nail size chip out of it .
5,Maja Perfume,"Have been using this product for 40 years. Is very hard to find now. Wonderful fragrance. People will ask ""what are you wearing""? A little goes a long way."
3,Not as expected,"Smells good at first, but scent does not last very long and have not gotten any compliments as one does when a scent can be smelled, but not overpowering."
4,"Nice, but HUGE","This cooler is nice, and looks fancy but it is gigantic. I had to forcefully shove it up against my power supply bending the heat sink fins a bit. It runs quiet and does an excellent job of cooling. if it does not mention this: it does not have cpu control function."
4,Good CPU coller,"I love it, it is not designed for the motherboard I had but I made some modification to the GPU cooling unit and was able to fit it in. Works like a charm.Also if you are in the market for the CPU cooler make sure you do your research and based on personal experience I recommend screw based CPU coolers over push clasp. The concept behind a push clasp cooler is awesome however it can be a pain to fit on a motherboard."
3,May be a great cooler...,"....but not for most AM2 boards, as it's too close to the RAM slots.And the directions are cryptic on their best days."
5,Best Film/Documentary to Understand the Ethical Treatment of Animals,"Despite the fact that many people may say they ""love"" animals,the truth is that a person cannot truly say that and still eat or use animal products. ""Peaceable Kingdom"" is the one film that does a great job in revealing the shocking truth behind factory farming that is assumed as the norm for the majority of the world is still so ignorant of where their meat comes from. This film pushes compassionate people who care about animals yet are hesitant into vegetarianism/vegan into doing what is morally right. Although one does not necessarily have to change one's lifestyle after viewing ""Peaceable Kingdom"", one might see the world in a new perspective and understand animals are not so different from humans afterall."
3,Not as good as Seventh Generation,"While this TP is much softer then the Seventh Generation, there is much less per roll. Also, they use less post consumer recycled product then I have even seen in store brands. I believe it is around 30%."
4,Good choice,Earth Friendly Toilet paper is all around pretty great. It's very soft (though not as soft of course as traditional non-green t.p.). My only draw back is the low post-consumer content. At only 20% or so it's much lower than other brands...but I don't mind sacrificing that to have a bit more comfort than other types.
3,Good Quality BUT,"The quality of the paper is very good, but the rolls are very, very, very small. A roll lasts about two days around here. And the rolls came in a four-pack in plastic wrap. Kind of defeats the purpose of buying post-consumer, recycled paper when it's encased in plastic. I wrote to them to ask if the stuff was cellulose based and it's not. Nope, it's plastic al-righty.As much as I like the quality, I won't buy it again."
3,Fedex problems,"The product I received is fine however I felt the charge for shipping and handling to be somewhat excessive.This seems to be a common problem when ordering goods in Canada that are sent from the U.S.After paying $20 shipping and handling for a $30 item I was shocked when several weeks later I received a further invoice directly from Fedex for another $14, being $4 tax and $10 application fee.I have queried this with FiltersFast and have not has a satisfactory response.If I had known in advance of these additional charges I would certainly have not purchased the filter."
3,replacement is fine,"Cant taste the difference but went in like a charm, no spilling at all. wonder why the discontinued original , wonder if it would make a taste difference?"
1,Sent Wrong one,My son ordered this for his mom's gift. I told my son only order a real Maytag filter named UKF 7003AXX Puriclean.I received the filter today. They sent me a Pur filter. Why do they show a real Maytag filter picture and send wrong one? I called my son and asked him to send return label through an email. DO NOT BUY. NOT TRUST ONE.
1,IT doesn't work,The filter shown is not the one sent. I have taken the one out and put it back in at least a dozen times and my replacement light still stays on as though I need to replace the filter. I bought 2 of these filters - it has no directions or what it does or doesn't do like my original filter and like the one advertised.I'm very angry. So now I guess I'll have to call where I bought my ref. and get one from the company.
5,Maytag water filter,"Arrived in a timely fashion and immediately improved our water's taste. Our grandchildren were very specific in their comments on the ""better"" taste that our water from our refrigerator and ice had."
5,WATER FILTER,"RIGHT PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE. LOEWS, HOME DEPOT, WALMART OR ANY OTHER STORE THAT I COULD FIND CARRY THIS PRODUCT.THANKS FOR HAVING IT AVAILABLE.RT"
5,Maytag Water Filter,"This was the first time I had purchased the Maytag, PuriClean Water Filter from on line. I always went to our local Maytag store and got the new one there.The price at the store went up this year to $70.00 for one I found that to be excessive so I decided to go on line and try my hand.I found the exact same product on line for less than than half of what our local store was selling them for.This product came quickly and I installed it and it works perfectly. From now on I will be getting this item on line. No more going to the local store.KateSalt Lake City, Utah"
4,Item does what it is supposed to do.,"As the title says, it's a high quality filter and fits like the stock filter did. The filters received were replacement PUR filters due to the unavailability of the original filters. PUR equals or exceeds the quality of the Maytag filter, so I am satisfied with the substitution. The only disappointment in the substitution is that apparently the PUR comes in 2-packs, and one was split out of the celopack to make up for the 3-pack as advertised, and was not sealed in the cellophane."
4,Maytag refrig filter,The filter was $20 less than the one in the store and it works great. I suggest trying it.
2,Wrong product shipped,"I bought this item months ago as my water filter change light was flashing for a while. I ordered the UKF7003AXX product; however, I received the UKF7002AXX product instead. The latter product is less expensive and not as good as the former. Since I was needing to change the filter immediately I went ahead and installed the product they shipped me and settled for it. The UKF7002AXX product does work well, but I am a little upset they sent the wrong and cheaper item. Please note that I did not contact the company, so I am unsure as to how they may have handled the error."
2,Misleading,"You know, the picture shows a PuriClean filter. The title contains the words PuriClean filter. Well, I got the Maytag version of a PuriClean filter which lasts half as long. Six months instead of a year! Seems like very misleading advertising to me..."
5,taste very good,Now I'm only drinking the water from my Maytag refrigerator. This filter works so nice. I don't need order the Alhambra Water anymore.
2,Not sealed like older model,"Maytag is keeping coming out a newer model for its water filter. In 4 years time frame, I have purchased 3 different models of water filters for the same refrigerator. The previous two models had been sealed in tie plastic wrap. This model is store in a paper box which means you won't know if the water filter has been used or not. Maytag is cutting the 5 cent plastic seal to loose my confidence. I'm thinking just buying compatible filter next time."
5,filtersfast.com,i am very pleased wtih the filter i bought from filtersfast. the product was brand new in the package. the product arrived promptly and the cost was much savings. thank you from a homemaker in oklahoma for helping me save money. i would recommend filtersfast to all my friends and family.
2,Leaden musical with great dancing,I would not recommend this musical to anyone unless they just have to complete their collection of Gene Kelly movies.The story is a typical formula for this type of movie and time. Dreadful dialogue; worse plot. I couldn't wait till it ended.The dancing however is great and a cut version with just that would be worth the entire movie.
4,FORGOTTEN GEM OF WIDESCREEN MUSICALS,"Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen's ""It's Always Fair Weather"" broke new ground for its day, influencing the later widescreen ""West Side Story"" to a degree with its streetwise, horizontally mindful choreography. Andre Previn was barely out of diapers when he scored this epic; the story suffers from not being able to have cast Jules Munchin and Frank Sinatra to make ""IAFW"" the ""On the Town"" sequel it was initally intended to be. Between its obvious bitter satire of television and the palpable lamentation of the musical genre, self-parody is courted here but not quite, thankfully, embraced. Michael Kidd's dances are underrated bits of sheer athletic genius. Truly the last and best of Hollywood's original musicals. Eons ahead of its time."
2,Pan and Scan Disaster,"Everytime I see this VHS, I think back to an interview with Kelly where he said this film would never be released on VHS during his life because he would have to chop it in half. Kelly hated the pan and scan that came with a standard 1.33:1 TV screen and if you ever see this film letterboxed, you will understand why. (Luckily I have the Gene Kelly Collection on laserdisc which is letterboxed.)It is a gritty film, that at times moves a little slowly, but the tap dancing rollerskates is truly one of the most talented things I have ever seen Kelly do-it is amazing.Serious Gene Kelly fans should push for a re-issue of the above mentioned collection on DVD. Then you could see it as it should be seen."
4,The most under rated musical of all time,"I must admit to having seen most of the great musicals with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly the Americans are the tops when it comes to musicals. This musical has my most enjoyable tap dance routine of all with Gene kelly tap dancing on roller skates, now I now Fred & Ginger did a similar routine in 1937 however they did not have the sheer movement and skope that kelly had.If however you require a plot I am afraid this musical is a little short, however it does amble along and there is a few light hearted moments especailly watch out for the cinemascope on the new DVD where you can finally enjoy the complete scenes featuring Ted (Gene Kelly), Doug (Dan Dailey), and Angie (Michael Kidd) performing their dance routines."
5,Amazing exfoliator and acne prevention!,"I'm a 16 years old guy. My mom recommended this product to me a few months ago. At first I was a little skeptic about this product since I heard that if it burns, it means the person's skin is irritated by it, which happened to me after using it for the first time. I stopped for 1 week, then decided to use it again, but that time, it was continuously and I ignored the burn. I had severe acne back then, but 3 months later, all those severe acne are gone and it's all scars now, but no more bumps/whiteheads whatsoever! My acne scars went from red to dark and is now in the process peeling off which means it is now in the exfoliating mode. I have a before and after picture of my acne but I will not post it for now. Also, it smoothed my skin out and even out the tone. Though the bad thing is that it burns and gets your face dry, so I recommend applying a non-comedogenic moisturizer such as Aveeno. But overall, this product was AMAZING (:"
3,Good for Occasional Use,"Don't use this set if you are a professional sheet metal or body shop worker. It will not hold up under constant use, but it is a very good value for occasional use."
3,Mixed bag,"I recently purchased this chair direct from another vendor, ShadeUSA, and was very disappointed to see that the seat does not lock into any of the reclined positions. In other words, the chair does not stay reclined when you sit up, it pops up as you do. Even when sitting down the arms 'float' above the locking area. Perhaps this problem will resolve itself with some use, but this shouldn't even be an issue. I'm surprised that no one else noted this in their reviews, perhaps I just got a dud. It is not worth it financially to return the product, otherwise I would.Other than the above noted defect, it's a well designed sturdy comfortable chair that will make my trips to the beach more enjoyable."
3,Good chair for a good price.,"A good chair, but the back didn't come forward far enough. My wife couldn't sit in it, the back was to far reclined. I moved the runners under the arms to fix the problem. Shouldn't have to do this with new products, but at least it was fixable."
2,Does not ship well,"I ordered this chair after having used one at a bed and breakfast. Despite being a very comfortable and convenient chair, it arrived broken. Then the replacement arrived bent. It's too bad really because I think it's a great chair."
5,Love the chair...my friends all want one too!,"Very satisfied w/the product. Love to stuff the kids ""beach blanket"" in the backpack portion, and my 6 year old can carry it using the straps like a backpack. The only drawback is the weight of the chair due to the wooden arms, but the quality definitely makes it stand out compared to the inexpensive aluminum beach chairs. I think it will last a long time....Thank-you"
4,good chair but.....,"thought i had found the perfect chair but, although this chair seems to be very sturdy it, is quite heavy ... it is very comfortable as a backpack. it could use an outer pocket or two and the arms should be wider. Twice when using this chair I was getting up and must of pulled up on the arms or something ,whatever happened,my finger got jammed up between the arm and the leg ...hurt like hell, now I'm more careful."
3,Buyer Beware: Chair Material Not Sweat Friendly,"I used this as a beach chair through 2008. It's an excellent chair for transporting all my beach things: ipod, towel, wallet, hawaiian tropic. It folds easily and never found it heavy for me at all walking to the beach with it slung over one or two shoulders.But...i'm an old-school beach bum and the material they use for the chair is very sturdy and thick, but also would make me sweat a lot. I would get up from about an hour on the beach and the entire chair would be soaked with my sweat.I'm not a sweaty guy - i'm really not.I have been on other beach chairs in my life, and this one I need to lay a towel on it to soak up my sweat.I think its much better suited for camping over the beach...but I still think it's a ""OK"" beach chair, which is why i'd give it 3 stars.If the manufacturer could make something more suited for beach use (a lighter, thinnner more comfortable material) I think it would be an even bigger hit."
4,Comfortable/Functional Beach Chair,"Excellent beach chair for upright or recline comfort. It doesn't recline far enough to make laying on your stomach too comfortable though. It has a cupholder made of the same material. The cupholder is screwed into place on the arm of the chair. I expect that after some use it will probably detach. The backpack function is excellent. The straps fairly comfortably make carrying the chair easy while freeing up your hands. The storage pouch on the back of the chair is very roomy; you can carry quite a bit. It has a flap to keep out the sand. For comfort and convenience, it's an easy 4 stars. Overall, I give it 3 stars. I'm borderline 4 stars until I give it more usage to see how well it holds together. I've used it for two summers and it seems to be holding up well. It looks good enough though that I bought two more. Recommended."
2,unhappy,"I received the chair and was excited about getting it, until I picked it up and put it on my back. I'm only 5'1"" and found the chair to be heavy to carry even with nothing in it. I carried my towl and water separetely and yet when I got home the bag was ripped by the straps on the storage part of the chair. I returned the chair."
5,best chair for camping,"I have owned this chair for over 2 years now & I camp about 20 times per year. This chair is holding up just fine. Keeping people outta MY chair is a chore around the campfire, cuz it is pretty comfy - with the headrest pillow! The built in backpack is handy for storage of maps, air beds, blankets, books or hiking boots. I cannot wait to buy the newer version with thicker metal tubing. I would highly recommend this one - from Total Escape's founder DanaMite."
5,Ultimate Beach Accessory,"After years of going to the beach with an awkward armload of chair, towel, cooler, sunblock, book, walkman/mp3 player, etc., I have found nirvanna. It is called This Chair. It holds all of the above easily in its ample storage pouch, and is comfortable to hump out to the beach. The seat is comfortable and adjustable, and the pillow can be velcroed to the desired position, or thrown over the back if unwanted. The construction is sturdy but lightweight, and it folds into a neat an compact package that stores easily out of the way. I got compliments and inquiries on it the first time I used it, and think they need a franchise for these here in South Beach."
5,"Finally, the perfect Beach chair!","Easy to carry (on your back!), Room for extras (book, towel, snacks), and comfortable to boot! The headrest brings this chair over the top"
3,lightweight,"This chair is extremely light weight and easy to use (i.e. it's a folding chair). It's great actually, the only reason I give it 3 stars is because of the size. I'm a average sized girl and it works fine but when average sized men use it they have complained about feeling the bars on the sides because the fabric doesn't extend far enough. This is compared to the Tommy Bahama chairs which are pricier but sturdier and better for full bottomed people."
4,perfect do anything chairs..,"perfect chairs for a day at the park or the beach...my wife loves the built in backpack...light weight and easy to cary...a little pricey, but worth it.."
1,piece of junk,"This was the worst purchase I have made through Amazon. The seam on the seat began to rip the first time it was used. It resembles other beach chairs that I purchased previously, but the quality was missing. In fact, some one could have fallen right through the chair and had a nasty fall. With only thirty days to return it, I missed the deadline. So it goes in the garbage."
3,Wearever chairs,"The chairs came sooner than expected - and in-time for our blues-festival.However - we thought that the chairs were fairly uncomfortable .. and we had to constantly shift around, to try to get comfortable. Also ... you could not wear any ""larger"" type of hat ... as the top of the chair, kept knocking it off.We were surprised that they were so user UNfriendly.They're small in height - but other than that - I would not recommend them."
4,Small group jazz,"This is an excellent small jazz group cd. All the musicians are top rate, and the song choices are very good. The sound quality of the recording is very high also."
3,Mad Gab Review,"It's too easy! I am 20 my sister is 18 and my parents are in there 50's and we all had a fairly easy time completing all three cards in each round. It was disappointing. Maybe it's harder with a larger group or younger group, but it doesn't alter my overall disappointment with the game."
1,A Total WASTE!!!,"I bought this game a few months ago to play at my annual game night. After playing the usual-Taboo, Phase 10, and Scattergories-for a couple of hours, I broke out Mad Gab, which was a complete flop. Most of my guests were in their mid-20s to late 40s, and EVERYONE practically begged me to stop with this game after about five minutes. The phrases on the cards from both the easy and intermediate sides were easy to guess and just not worth the five minutes spent playing it. My guests even told me to return the game and get my money back! I was embarrassed for breaking up the fun time we were having playing other worthwhile games. I eventually put the game back into my closet, and it will stay there until I drop it off at a charitable organization. It is defnitely NOT worth the money or time. I saw other reviews that hinted that the game may be fun after a few drinks, which most of us had. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! It is a total waste of money!"
2,All the fun of a grocery store loudspeaker,"I played this at a friend's party, and it was a wretched party game. It basically consists of a person reading the puzzle in a monotone voice and allowing everyone else to attempt to figure it out. It is incredibly monotonous, and a throughly awful game to play at a party.I admire its cleverness. It took a lot of creativity and know-how to make up these challenging puzzles. But for the sake of all your guests, I emplore you: Hide this boring game. Hide it as well as possible.The painful thing is that out of a choice between Mad Gab and Lost: The Game my friend chose Mad Gab. It's sad, really."
5,Super Fun Game!,"This game is perfect for game nights. This game is great for family and friends. I'm not going to lie, it's pretty challenging at least for me. My teammates seemed to be pretty good at it, but I'm definitely not as skilled. It's tough sometimes and other times it's pretty easy. I totally recommend the buy if you want to get it to play with family or drinking game nights with friends."
4,good family fun,"Larger mixed age teams make for the most fun since some sayings, songs, people are not in every age groups knowledge base."
5,fun game,I learned this game from a friend and love it. It is so much fun trying to figure out what others are saying and translating it to another phrase. I am in the age range of 18-25 and would recommend it to any age player.
3,Mad Gab,"This game was just okay...after playing it for about 30 minutes, it became very boring, even playing with a teenager. We were both bored with it."
5,MadGab,Gave as a Christmas gift by request. Have not played the game but my family says it is a lot of fun.
4,Lots of laughter,"My daughter (21) requested this game; I hadn't played it before and it's very entertaining. We played with the whole family, age ranges from 11 through 50+ and everyone got into it. Some of the references were more difficult depending on your age, but there is enough variety that it all evens out. We laughed a lot, and that's always a good thing!"
2,The idea is sound but.....,It's a good idea but.....from a mommy perspective it's not very practical. I would always forget them or would be so hassled by the car seat and diaper bags or whatever. When I did use them by the time I found a cart and then dug out the covers and peeled the backings the kid would be howling. If you put the child in the cart first - it's already too late. After while you get to the point where it just doesn't matter that much to you anymore. I would save the money and just keep a travel pack of huggies wipes handy to wipe down the bars and little hands.
3,Not worth the 20 bucks,"This concealer does cover dark circles and redness, but it does crease underneath my eyes really fast. You def need to set it with a mineral powder; That did the trick! This should be priced at 10 bucks instead."
5,"Yes, it is Magic.","I don't know how but the shade is correct or provides the coverage needed but it does. Unfortunately, I now have the age spots and they get covered the way I want. Yeah for Paula Dorf."
3,not gonna learn bo from this book,"this book is just one of those ""cool to have"" books. People sometimes refer to it so it's good to know what they are talking about. By the way, there is a famous ""hand written"" densho written by a man named Takashi Ueno from Tenshin Koryu. Well I have news for those of you who covet this densho. If you compare the densho to this kuki book, you can see that Ueno didn't just copy the kuki book, but he TRACED over the pictures of this book."
4,Beautiful Mask!!,Mask came quickly. It was good quality and was absolutely gorgeous with my dress. I was extremely happy with it.
5,Delightful!,I bought this book for my 2 1/2 year old son. It is now our favorite book! We read it every day at nap and bedtime. It is the perfect length for before bed. Plus the message is wonderful! I highly recommend this book.
3,Love wins out,Easy book to read. If you follow the Royals this may have a lot you already know. This book addresses why Charles and Camilla ultimately ended up with each other. It also shows her in a good light. Their relationship mirrors the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Co-dependent.......
4,Camilla and Charles: The Love Story,Very good book. Received the book promptly and in good condition. Would recommend it. Good reading.
5,The Wind in the Chimes,"This is a lovely, loving tribute from an adult daughter to hernow-deceased father. Ms. Clark shares with us her experiences asa caregiver to her dad during the devasting progression of hisbattle against Parkinson's disease. And she also shares with usher quest to get to know him better before he passes on. She raisesuniversal questions about the quality of life and death, and howto bring grace to both. The book made me smile, laugh and cry."
2,Dim replacement for Gaslamp,"If you are trying to add accent lighting this is good.However, if you want any light dont buy it.Our HOA decided to replace all the gaslamps with this one to save money annually. Now all the yards have glowlamps that do not really light the yard. About 1/2 are out in the middle of the night. We live in Las Vegas so there is plenty of sunlight.Generally do not buy this with the intention of lighting the area around the lamp. Buy it only with the intention of have a glowlamp."
4,Malibu Solor-Powered Outdoor lamp,It isn't as bright as the powered lights. We like it anyway. It is bright enough for what we use it for. I would buy more solor powered lights to put around our yard. It was much bigger then we expected. That makes up for the dimmer light.
5,Very good volleyball,This ball was recommended by the person who organizes and runs the volleyball club my daughter participated in. It was used as the game ball. My daughter loves to play and needed a good practice ball for home. This is a great item.
1,product swap,thats right i ordered a med/lg belt. when it came the package had been opened and the med/lg belt had been taken out and a small put in the container.too late to do anything about it now. im stuck. however the company should be a little more careful . i have seen this type of action from the midwest to the west coast.disgusting. therefore i cannot give this a fair rating.i do however hope the individual who made the swap is happy.
4,Back Support Belt,"My husband has had spinal stenosis and arthritis in his back for quite a few years. As such, he's had to wear a support belt to relieve his pain. I had been paying at least $30 for his belts until I found this one for $18. This is a superior product to the others I had purchased for him in the past. The only thing I would suggest is that they be made in other colors, such as white and beige (these only come in black) so they could be used under light colored clothing."
4,story is too dry.,"book in fair condition, but not as description would lead me to imagine, still good service"
2,I guess it keeps the car seat warm??!!??,"This product is a piece of crap.. I wanted it because it said it was crash tested and cannot be kicked off.. I didn't get to see it in person before ordering it....it is so small and only covers the very bottom of the seat.. the ""blanket"" that comes with it ,is the size of a hanky.. and as thin as the material they give you when you buy a pair of eye glasses,to clean them .....ridiculous..ok it was only 10 $ but its still wasted money..pass on this one.. use a regular blanket or make sure your child is properly layered.. I usually like Graco products but this one is a dud! :("
1,Mildly entertaining,"We like MXC, Banzuke and Ninja Warrior -- if you like those, don't get this. It was shot in the mid '90s and more silly (and I don't mean fun-silly) than anything else."
1,Wrong product,"I received the wrong product. I ordered ""Endurance"" as pictured but received ""The Endurance"". Different movie that was pictured."
2,Terrible option for makeshift shelves,"Initially, these shelves seemed to work fine... and then we started actually using them. First, the plastic mounting guides are very flimsy. When weight is on the shelves, they routinely warp and, coupled with the movement of the door they're attached to, the shelves come out of the bottom mounting holes on a weekly basis. The worst part about these shelves though is the lack of a side bar. When mounted to a door which is their intent, the momentum of the swing pulls items outwards towards the side... but the side only has one bar at the maximum height so when it holds tall items that fall over due to the door swinging or items that are shorter than the shelf, they come flying out the side. Usually this is a can of cooking spray or a short can of diced tomatoes which are both heavy enough to leave an awesome bruise on mytoe after opening the door in a hurry while fixing breakfast... nothing like limping into work because you busted your toe on a can of Pam."
3,Braces not metal!,"The unit arrived on time, new in it's packaging. It seemed light to me and once open I realized the braces that hold the shelves were some kind of flexible plastic or nylon........not sure what it is. What I do know is they are not metal. This is not what I thought I was buying into. Once summer comes the temps will be higher here in AZ. Higher temps may soften the braces that could be a mess. If your looking for sturdy I'd say don't bother with this product. If your loading shelves with toilet paper it might work just fine for you."
2,Instructions,"The only thing that was in the bag was a receipt. Even though it seems easy enough. I am NOT good at putting things together, and besides anything that needs to be assembled big or small should come with paper of how to put it together"
3,24 inch rack is cheaply made,"All though I still get a lot of storage out of this rack, I limit it to only light items. As some of the other reviews have stated, the product is some what flimsy and cheaply made."
4,Adjustable Door Rack Pantry Organizer,"I bought this product to expand storage space in our old colonial home. It didn't quite fit on the back of my basement door as one complete unit. We had to separate the unit between the 5th and 6th shelves. However, it does serve the purpose. Since the shelves are not solid at the base I had to line some of them with cardboard so that I could store smaller things like spices. I have all types of jars and containers and the shelves are holding up very well. Overall I am satisfied with this item."
5,Fantastic Space Saver!,Since we just moved into a smaller place I needed something to put extra kitchen items on and this fit the bill. We actually mounted it to the side of the refrigerator and it works perfectly. The shelves are adjustable and hold way more than I had hoped for. Since the shelves are over 5 inches wide it was perfect for larger spice bottles and box items. I also lined the shelves with the grip type lining and it works great for holding things in place.24 Inch Wide Adjustable Door Rack Pantry Organizer
2,Cheap product,The item doesn't tell the buyer enough about the product. The rails are plastic and the baskets are made out of a light gage metal. I bought metal rails from menards and drilled them to fit. Installed a third rail down the middle and L shape angles under the basket to support heavier items. The cost increased 2 1/2 times from the original purchase but now it will hold what I want. It was either that or the garbage.
4,Great Extra Storage,"Installed behind door nearest to kitchen to add some pantry space. Works great - would have preferred metal support brackets as opposed to plastic ones supplied but they seem to be holding up to all the weight I have in the shelves. All in all, I am very satisfied with this product."
2,functional but not very sturdy,"I purchased this for extra storage space in my under the stairs pantry. It comes in several pieces, all plastic, to mount to the door. Installation is easy enough, but you need a level, a measuring tape and electric screw driver. You can stager the heights of the shelves for large cereal boxes, etc., but the shelves are not too deep. You cannot store any large cans, too heavy and too wide and the ends are open so stuff falls right through. If they made the end on the shelves closed, it would be more functional. Also, the bottom of the shelves allow smaller items to fall through. Not a bad by for the $$ but they need to correct these mistakes with the shelves for a truly great item. I like it well enough as it at least gives me extra storage space for boxes, so I will give it 2 stars"
1,"terrible quality, cheap","Terrible quality, cheap, beyond measure, plastic fastners. Cheaply made. would not pawn this off on another person.when I tried to return and get my money back, they said I could, but I would have to pay a re-stocking fee. Cost me more to send it back, than it is worth. Terrible workmanship. Not nice company, either."
3,Have purchased better organizer Racks,"The rack was very difficult to install. Must have a level. It is not very sturdy either. If you have a full rack of can goods it sags. It gets the job done, but I feel it won't last long because of the sagging."
1,Horrible Plastic Quality,"The quality of the rails on which these racks go is horrible - it's cheap plastic!!! How can you expect it to hold the weight of even the racks - forget the items you put on the rack! DO NOT BUY - not worth, even if it is cheaper price than what you find elsewhere."
3,Needs more center support.,"I bought two of these units and one had a single shelf already broken. I'm not overly upset, but it doesn't give me a good feeling of the quality. The edges slip into the plastic rails which are screwed directly into the door so they are very secure. The center sags is more than a slight bit of weight is added because the shelving is made of very thin metal. I may try and fabricate some sort of support for the center portion.I may be asking too much from this type of unit. I don't have another in which to compare the durability."
2,not what I expected,"I bought this for my sons college dorm and the pic looks like it fits over the door but it needs to be screwed into the door or wall, which we can't do. I need to return it"
4,Organized my pantry!,"This is not the best rack out there but sure worked for me. If u have a little knowledge of drill and measuring tape. It will be very easy for u to install. I am a very handy woman and it took me about 10 mins to install this whole rack on my pantry door. It is not very strudy though. Like it shows in the pic that it can hold so many cans(not true) it can hold all ur little cardboard boxed supplies like popcorns, cereals and stuff. It sure organize you space though. I liked this rack alot!"
4,Seems to work,"This was a gift so I can't say from first hand how easy it is to use. However, I've seen it in use and it seems fairly easy to work. It sounds real and seems to work.If you are a Dove hunter or know a Dove hunter you can't go wrong with this call."
5,Whatever you call it - it is still a dictatorship!,"This book is dictatorship and the struggle against it. The dictator is Charlemange, and the opposition is led by newly conquered Lombard nobles. It is not a book about ninth century Europe - it is a book about our own times. Dictatorships are all the same, even if they are known by different names. The struggle against them is also timeless; even an oppressed nobleman is still oppressed! The methods of dictatorships remain the same also: torture, disappearances, secret police, concentration camps, etc. The book could rank with 1984, George Orwell was also an apostate from communism.This book got Eyvind Johnson in trouble with the cultural elite in Sweden: they saw it as an attack on the Soviet Union. The author had been an ardent communist, but after visiting Stalinist Russia he denounced it as just another dictatorship, and that communism was a sham. The treatment he received form his former friends forced him to commit suicide."
3,Ehh...,"These tongs are nice and long, but the weight of the stainless is much less than what I had expected. It makes me feel like the quality is lacking. They'll do the job, but if I had it to do again, I would have chosen a different set of tongs."
4,Very good quality - meets my needs,love the locking action for drawer storagewish oxo would make one like thisgood qualitymeets our needswe would recommend
4,Decent Campfire Cookset,"This was a good product for cooking over a campfire. Only two problems, first, the handles on the lids come loose too easily, and second is that the nonstick lining on one of the pots scratched off on the lip (just from the lid). Aside from that, the aluminum heats evenly and quickly, and it makes a great set for two to three campers cooking over fire. I'm betting that it would be great on a little campstove, too. Would definitely recommend this product."
5,Hand-On training for pepole in a hurry,I am very happy that I invested my money in this book because my students have been using Microsoft Office 2000 and have learned so much because it helps you through the whole learning process step...by...step. It is ideal for classroom instructor led training and for at home self-pace study. Plus the new low price is great.
4,Another series for P.C. Doherty,"P.C. Doherty brings us another series and another hero, Roger Shallot, who is funny, witty and dishonest. Shallot along with his friend and master Ben are sent on a fact finding mission by Ben's uncle,High Cardinal Wolsey. Shallot and Ben are sent to help Queen Margaret be restored to her throne in Scotland. While doing this they find conspiracies, adultery and murder.Mr. Doherty continues to be the best writer of historical mysteries I have found"
4,"Hip, 60s, British Vet","This is a wonderful read (on tape). The narrator is a young, 60s, London veterinarian taking care of everything from racehorses to jealous female cobras. After you listen this long, it feels as if the characters are all neighbors and you miss them!It's an interesting sort of a relic; not a James Herriott by any means, but intriguing nevertheless."
2,Pyrethrin ?,I was looking for a spray containing Pyrethrin . the only active ingredient in this is listed as Neem Oil. Not sure what's up with that?I have Neem oil already & it is wonderful stuff. but I needed Pyrethrin - which is more of an pesticide made from chrysanthemums.
1,Over-priced bundles...,"Ok kids... let's do some math. You have a 4-season bundle-pack for $156, and individual seasons 1-4 for $33 each...Let's see... $33x4 = $132. So...$156 vs. $132. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't buying things bundled/en masse/in bulk supposed to be cheaper than buying individually? Come on, Amazon! I don't think anyone doesn't appreciate your generally low prices, however, I'd think it would be prudent to mark down bundles accordingly. This disparity is indicative of sloppy control measures/oversight in my book.I'd like to make clear my poor rating is directed towards Amazon and its quality control, not the product, which is a fine series."
2,Why is this more expensive???,"I'm ordering NCIS season episodes, but wonder why this 4-pack is $60 more than ordering the 4th season with the 3-pack? That's bizarre."
5,I love this series,I like all of the episodes of this TV show. I will miss the players they supposedly eliminated the last season.
1,Rudolph,"I was tricked, I thougt this was the original Rudolph. I did not even watch it. Would love a refund."
4,All the classics,Stroll down memory lane as each show plays. I had forgotten about many of these. My kids primarily wanted to see the Rudolph on which was shorter than I expected. We were hoping for the full story.
5,Wonderful look back into our history,I really enjoyed watching the Christmas cartoons of my fathers generation and the greatest time of this country's history. I applaud Amazon for not censoring these cartoons. It gave me wonderful opportunities to have meaningful discussions with my young daughter. Merry Christmas to all.
2,Not what I expected...,Didn't like the videos. They were older than I realized and didn't really want my son watching it...mainly because of the dress of some of the kids in video.
2,Thought this was the popular Rudolph! Very short basic story!,What a surprise! Don't know the year this was made but guessing 40's possibly earlier. It's really short. I think you'll like it if you are a cartoon buff or historian!
2,some classics should be forgetten,"Bad video quality and bad sound, sure the source material is old.Antiquated stereotypes of pretty much anyone who is not white and from the lower 48 states (there is some Hawaii slander in there too), sure that's the history of America.Something you want to share with your kids in 2012. NOPE!"
1,i'd skip it,"i gave this a a try today via free (Amazon Prime) streaming. It's terrible, and i barely got through the Rudolph story before i had to turn it off. A shame, because I'm sure the makers had the best of intentions, but the story was entirely lackluster and didn't contain even a hint of the classic stop-motion rudolph charm."
1,Video quality horrible!,"Quality of this video was terrible! It was not at all what we was expecting, I wish we had watched a different one. Do not waste your money."
2,Shockingly racist,"I started watching this with my daughter thinking it would be fun to see something hand-drawn from a different era. This collection of animations would never be accepted today. Black people and chimpanzees are nearly indistinguishable. One Chinese child is drawn with his eyes so squinted he cannot possibly see, and he is almost immediately put to work doing the laundry. A white baby falls into a pot of soot, becomes blackened, and crawls out to a mammy who cries ""oh mah baby!"" Just...shockingly bad. If it weren't for the overt racism, I would find these short animations very entertaining for their classic styling, the music, and the creativity."
1,Not that bad...if you are a RACIST!,"The video quality is poor, and I can forgive that since these are classic videos. But I couldn't get over the racism. Sure that is how people thought at that time, but that doesn't make it right in 2012. I surprised Amazon doesn't pull this since it is clearly so offensive. The black child was shining shoes and the Chinese child was doing laundry. For real!?!"
1,"Oh, it's bad, baaaaad, baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad","This is quite possibly the worst set of Christmas videos ever sold. They're very dated and, as another reviewer noted, racist. The kind of kids' programming that nobody's allowed to make any more. I think they would make a very fascinating dissertation topic, but not great for children's shows."
1,Horribly Racist Cartoon with Antiquated Images,"After the first, cheerful rudolph cartoon, there is a 2nd cartoon portraying children from around the world doing chores for santa ""Santa's Surprise"". This included some of the most horrendously racist portrayals of children of color. This video should not be made available - it was absolutely offensive and should be taken off the movies available to rent."
1,I turned it off because of my kid,"What every other one star said. Heavy racial stereotypes. My husband is a regionally well known, published historian, and he did not find anything redeeming from an historical perspective.They are pretty old animation sequences, but I don't have a problem with the ""quality"" per se of the animation as a general viewer. But there is no way my child is watching these for entertainment and we are calling it a teaching moment when my alternative is to turn it off and teach her that is the appropriate response. Its free on Netflix, BTW. I would have been pretty upset if we had paid to rent it.Remember uncle Remus? That kind of thing. Disney put that in the vault and won't let it out for a good reason. Romanticizing derogatory stereotypes or feeling nostalgic about entertainment with racist overtones is inappropriate. But if you must, please do not indelibly etch these images into your child's consciousness."
2,dissapointed,"I too have read great reviews for this movie and put down the 25 bucks with little hesitation. This movie ended up being a stinker. I was sick of the 'bad beats' after the first half hour. if you are a true poker enthusiast than i reccomend watching this doc. if you can find it in your local video rental store, but dont buy it like i did."
1,Mindnumbing,"I was quite excited this afternoon as I found this DVD in my mailbox and settled onto the couch to watch yet another film about one of my favorite topics. Within fifteen minutes, I'd decided that the two filmmakers/documentarians were so appallingly annoying I had to stop watching. I must have missed the best bits which were sure to follow. In the off-chance that they read this--beginning a poker film with cloying, kid-hugging moments is almost always a bad play."
1,No Limit on how bad a movie can be,"This was a real disappointment. I watched it as a Netflix rental and I'm very glad that I did not have to actually pay to see it.The first problem is that the title clearly implies that it is about no limit hold'em (probably to benefit from the popularity of that variation). The games played are all PLO and stud games. I cannot believe that this was not done intentionally to be misleading. As you get to know Susan, it certainly seems to be within her character. If you are not thoroughly annoyed with her by the end of the movie ... I don't know what to say. I also have to feel a little sorry for Tim (her partner) and have to wonder why he would put up with her.On the positive side, the moments/interviews with the pros are nice, but they get too little screen time. Also, this is a real slice of life film (and bad poker is part of the poker world).The current price of $25 is way too high for something you are ultimately not going to want in your collection."
3,Well... a poker journey,"It presents a girl going thru different omaha tourneys, but no good poker content... it shows that it's hard to become a pro, but i don't like the way that the girl relays on luck, but you can feel so many times like the main character on this movie... it will not help you to improve your game.. but will tell you that u cant win all the time"
5,The Essence of Poker,Great poker movie! Incredible interviews and insights on what ittakes to be a successful in poker and in life.
5,home run...or royal flush,This documentary far exceeded my expectations. The interviews of the poker greats are top notch and they alone are worth the purchase price. The lead woman is annoying...but in a way that keeps you watching the film to see what she will do next. I'm not a big poker player but really enjoyed this documentary. Its a home run.
5,the right tool,ground at a 0 degree making it stay in the slot without damage even under great pressure. I use these to restore antique carburetors and other non replaceable items. You should not be without these bits
4,Good Buy,Great for a backup or for people that don't too many pictures except for holidays and vactions. A good buy and great delivery. Works well with Olympus cameras.
1,The XD type doesn't work in all cameras,"The olympus card ""XD"" type is not readable in all olympus cameras, then why doesn't it say anything about it. My camera is an olympus D-390, fairly good and inexpensive camera, but I had to acquire another card cause of the memory card."
4,olympus xd,"Holds lots of pics. Doesn't do well on repeated viewings of shots taken, on read , lots of read error signals."
2,very slow,"when using this picture card it sticks after taking a picture and i have to wait much longer than with my other card. not a good back up. probably a second. live and learn,take your business some where else."
4,Better than OEM,This Card works better downloading to my computer than the Card that came with the Camera. It seems odd but is recognized faster.
5,picture card review,Olympus 128MB xD-Picture Card PNY Retail PackI was given an older camera and found out that it doesn't take a card larger than 128MB - I looked everywhere and found them here at Amazon. I received the card promptly and it works wonderfully. So to my relief I found a source for the smaller cards and am able to use the camera a friend was generous to gift me.
5,a good one,it is a good one...i can now take 200+ pictures of high resolution without any problems. it' worth!!! :-)
5,Picture Card,I have found the product to be of the highest quality and performs as expected. I chose this size card because it offers the most storage without compromizing the performance of the camera.
4,"An Adorable Mix of Love and Crazy, Surreal and Real","Dom and Fiona are strange, slightly insane people. And this is the story of how they fall in love, have a baby, run from the police, lose a dog, find a dog, steal things, escape a loony bin, lose each other, find each other, go to prison....it's a feel-good-if-you-are-kinda-insane-yourself escape into a world where things either are, or arent, or are AND aren't what they seem. Full of clever visual jokes, and bare-bones but pretty filming, as well as a slew of diversified, quirky characters, teh simplicity of the joy and love in this movie is what takes it form just being some wierd indy movie to something a little more special, even at the price of being dorky. It never really loses you, and the honesty in the performances is delightful. Overall, a whimsical and strange but wonderful movie."
1,Lame,I had read a favorable review on this film which prompted me to search and order. Don't believe everything you read(including this).
4,"Durden's ""Gifts of an Eagle"" too good to be out of print.","Kent Durden's ""Gifts of an Eagle"" was a rare find at the Public Library, and one of those books you want to own once you've read it. There is something about ""Lady"", the eagle that Kent and his father raised, that reveals a personality, a wild conciousness that was quite marvelous to witness ""firsthand"". Kent and his father got a liscense from the state of California to capture and raise this golden eagle, (something I doubt is even possible any more, which makes this a piece of history too.) For anyone who loves eagles, you will never get a more personal experience than this. Although out of print, this excellent book can still be found with a little digging."
5,Very interesting,"Bought this book as a gift for my husband who is very interested in eagles. He devoured it in no time, sharing so many of the stories that he read about this bird and the father and son she touched with her life"
5,Out of print book order,"I was very pleased with the book when I received it, and ordered another one, later. I was also glad for the ""bookkeeping"" info. that was included with the delivery."
5,Wonderfully Insightfull,This book is intended to inspire and insight you into action. It is remarkable to see the clearly outlined examples in the personal stories and begin to realize that I have the option to choose my destiny. Well done!
5,18-55mm Lens,"When I got my new camera...a Rebel...I got a macro zoom lens with it...rather than start out learing the camera with a lens like that, I wanted a basic lens to use for routine photos...and to use when learing how to use the camera...it's perfect...ciao"
3,NOT a USM,"I dont know what lens everyone else here got but look at the photo on this product page.. this is NOT a USM lens, it does not say USM anywhere on the lens which means it is NOT a USM lens, at least the one I have is not a USM."
2,Was good when first purchased...,"I have this lens, because it came with my Rebel XT. It was the first SLR camera I ever owned, and good deal that it came with it's own lens. Well, when I first had it... it worked pretty good. My pictures were pretty sharp and good quality.NOW, it looks like I take pictures with a child's toy digital camera. I use it on my 20D now, and it is HORRIBLE. My pictures are blurry and not sharp, you can see EVERY pixel. I mostly shoot models, and it's NOT cutting it anymore. I bout the 50mm lens, and the quality difference is incredible. I really would be baffled if anyone bought this to OWN. It's okay for a lens you get with a camera, but besides that, I think it's the worse lens out there for Canon cameras."
2,Slow and not wide enough,"This is a slightly upgraded version of the Canon Rebel / 30D kit lens - you are much better off just getting it as part of a kit (like I did) or buying someone's used kit lens on the cheap. Buying this as a separate lens boggles the mind, however.Pros: useful range for casual daily situations and one-piece solution for travelCons: not wide enough; way too slow (I am referring to aperture, not focusing)If you need to have this zoom range, there are other Canons or Sigma/Tamrons that are much better options, even if a little more expensive. I almost never keep this on my 30D."
4,make great memories,This lens is great and if you want to take some amazing pictures I would suggest it for its great versatility. This lens is the first that we have gotten and it does what we need so far. Great for beginning!!!
5,CANON EOS DIGITAL SLR 18-55MM LENS,"Great beginning slr lens takes great pictures, it could be coupled eventually with a telephoto and/or more powerful lens to bring out the best in the camera."
2,why get an amazing slr and a mediocre lens?,"This lens takes ok pictures, by ok I mean that if you want your $700 SLR to take pictures like a $300 point-and-shoot, then this lens is fine. But for anyone who has an SLR for any other reason than to look cool (say, you are serious about photography and want to learn more), there are much better lenses out there. I *highly* recommend canon's prime (non-zoom, fixed) lenses, which can be had at very low prices, and which will really help you take (tecnhically, at least) amazing images. I use the 50mm 1.8 and am desiring the 28mm 1.8, but there are many other options.If you are new to the world of DSLR's and want to learn more and grow as a photographer, forget this forgettable lens!"
3,Go for a higher end lens.,"This lens is a great walk around lens if you're just taking pictures of the family, some friends, or other casual events. Do not expect professional grade pictures with this lens.Yes, for the amount of money you're paying, you're getting a bargain. Just expect incredibly soft focus and poor color rendition. I thought I had a bum copy of the lens when I first got it, so I went up to a local photo shop and tested one of theirs. Same problems with all three lenses they had. Soft focus, poor colors, and so on.At 18mm, the lens is a decent wide angle, even on a 1.6 crop sensor. When used at 55mm, there is significant degradation of image quality.Save yourself money and frustration. Go with the 28 - 135 USM IS or something similar. You'll get better colors and sharper images all around."
3,Not bad for a kit lens,"Let there be no mistake: this is the lens that comes with the 20D kit. I don't know about the digital Rebel, but I have purchased the 20D, and this is the lens that came with it. I'm fairly satisfied with it thus far, but I would be more inclined to pick up one of the L-series lenses instead as the glass is of noteably higher quality. I do admit that I am not a professional still photographer, but like to think that as a trained and experienced videographer I have fairly good judgement regarding picture quality."
3,So So!!,"This lens comes in a kit, so you shouldn't expect much out of it. It feels light weight, and very cheap. If your looking for sharpness and beautiful image quality, I would go with an ""L"" series lens."
4,Better than the average kit lens,"Most kit lenses are useable as paper weights and not much else. The 18-55mm is a nice exception to that trend. I recently bought a 20D to go along with my film body and got this lens because the 1.6x crop on the 20D robbed me of my nice wideangle lenses (though I've got much better telephoto now). For the price, it does a nice job with the sharpness. The color isn't the best, but with digital we can always tweak that later on.If you can afford the 17-40mm f/4L or 17-85mm EF-S, certainly buy those instead. If your budget is tighter, this is the best way to get a wideangle lens on a 20D or Digital Rebel. The Bob Atkins website has a great technical review of this lens as well."
5,"Great lens, better than the kit 18-55","As mentioned before, it is important to realize that this lens is NOT the kit lens that Canon includes with its digital SLR cameras. It has an ultrasonic motor (USM), which is the reason I bought my Rebel XT's body without a lens and picked up this lens to go with it. The USM feature means the focus is very quick, accurate, and nearly silent compared to many other lenses. I have not noticed any significant amount of softness or any defects in the photos I have taken with this lens, and it works like a charm. I would definitely recommend it to the first-time SLR user who wants a lens that will serve as a good starter model but not become obsolete as their photography progresses."
2,hi,"I own 3 lens. This is the worst, Feels and looks like garbage. Focus is pretty bad but Ok, Have tryed the IS version, way better than this even without IS on, Note that the IS one has a bigger front element. Also zoom is awkward, Overall.Things to think about:1.-This lens has a P&S; quality.2.-Try to get the IS one.3.-If more money then get Sigma 18-50 2.8-4 OS4.-If much more money get the tammy 2.8"
1,Worthless,"If you are interested in the Peace Corps and/or Malawi, avoid this work. Filled with misspellings and completely lacking in content and depth, this book is a waste of time."
2,Really? Someone wanted to publish this?,"As a Peace Corps volunteer who will be serving in Malawi shortly, I was so excited to get this book for Christmas and I read it right away. Although it was very insightful, brutally honest (ie- I can't even count the number of bowel mentionings), and written in everyday language (this includes multiple grammatical errors), I just can't see why anyone would want to publish a journal such as hers.So yes, if you are interested in the Peace Corps, are in the application process, or already nominated for a certain region, particularly Africa, I would definitely not suggest this book, unless you are 100% sure you want to go and would like to read up on the culture of Malawi and what the PC happenings looks like. If you are looking for motivation or encouragement to go overseas and dive into another culture and way of life, pass on this book."
4,great for jazzy blues rhythm guitar,"Most intermediate players love the blues (everyone loves the blues, actually). If you listen to jazz and swing blues players play cool chord changes, you'll realize they have more going on harmonically than Eric Clapton or Robert Johnson. This book explains what they are up to and how they do it. Especially cool is the historical approach he takes, starting with Freddie Green and moving forward. Note that this book is specifically focussed on jazz/swing blues rhythm guitar. It is not a complete jazz or blues method."
1,Feeling Blue?,"Waste of money and time. I write this just in order to prevent someone else to repeat my mistake and to by this EXPENSIVE and useless book. If you did not know anything about jazz blues guitar, you will not end up any smarter by buying this book.In contrary!"
4,A useful and enjoyable tool,I have been using this and the Blues Soloing for Jazz Guitar at the reccommendation of my guitar teacher and have found both books to be informative and useful. I am relatively new to guitar playing and have learned some difficult techniques at a rapid pace. My compliments to the author.
5,I LOVE this album!,"I bought this album as a double-length cassette in Toulouse, France in 1988, and I played it until I was afraid that I would stretch it out and break it, so then I started copying it! How happy am I to have it on CD!!!The songs on the two disks are almost reflections of each other--similar themes, with the first disk having high production values/stuff going on and the second being pretty minimalist (sometimes just him and a guitar or piano). Similar themes doesn't mean that it's boring, though--there's lots of musical variety, beautiful lyrics...it's great!"
5,Worth reading even if you don't need a patent!,"Who knew patents and intellectual property could be so interesting to read about? The examples of patents in here, like the method for preserving the dead, are a blast - and really serve to teach you something. You'll love the case studies, too. For those seeking patents, trademarks, trade secrets, or copyrights, what you need to know is laid right out. Other books on these subjects put you to sleep, this one is cool!"
3,Magnifying glass not included,"This might be a good book, but its hard to tell since the print is microscopic. The code examples are even tinier. Since there's no CD-ROM included, you have to type in the examples but that's difficult to do when one hand is holding the magnifying glass."
5,A tiny book packed full of good information,"This book really is a ""pocket guide."" It's the size of a little marketing book that you would expect to be free-- but people are paying $46 for this.This book explains the basics (such as ""what is PROFIBUS?"") and goes into detail about timing parameters, signal integrity, and pinouts. They crammed a lot of good information into a tiny book. There is no fluff whatsoever.Despite the high information density, which is really what you want from a book, it's hard to part with $46 for this tiny little book. Perhaps instead of having an engineer write it alone, they should have had a marketing person add some fluff so you feel like you're really getting something for your money.This book will save you from having to break out IEC61158 just to recall basic info."
2,An excellent example of marketing work,"This book give you very basic information about the profibus.An entire chapter is dedicated to how wiring the bus and how to connect the 2 bus wires into a DB9 connector.A very entry level book, hardly to read due to its phisical dimension.After take a look into it, I'm asking myself how it is possible to ask 49$ for this book."
2,Too much for a book that does not give you much,"The price of this book is way too much for the value it provides, I would not recommend this book to my worse enemies.It's hardly readable due to its small size and the paper quality would been better used as toilet paper.As for I.formation if you can read it, not much really useful for an engineer or technician that works in the field of automation.Better off reading the manual in German that comes with Turck excom profiles than this.Due your self a favore, and find a better source of information than this.Unless you make $500 an hour this book is really expensive for its purpose"
3,Ventshades,"Never had ventshades that mount on the rubber strip. Only time will tell if they hold up. I've had these on every truck I have ever owned, so hopefully they are as good as my past experiences."
3,Prep is Everything,"I have used the tape on kind before with not much problem. The small piece of scotch brite provided is not adequate nor the alchol wipes. The scoth brite needs to be at least 2 pieces and the alchol wipes need to be thicker. In any application where you have prep before installation, the prep is the most important part. I installed these on a 2008 F250 If these stay on through the Texas Summer, I will up the review.If you are installing these on a new vehicle that has not had armor all etc on the rubber then maybe the pieces are adequate."
4,"Not bad, installation is hairy",Putting these on is a pain due to the super strong tape. If you don't get it right the first time it's difficult to pull off and fix it. Otherwise they look good and function well once they are on.
1,Save your money,"This Lund Auto Ventshade Ventvisor is easy to install. It tapes to the inside felt seam of the window in the channel. I purchased the 4 piece smoke set for a 2008 Ford F250 Crew Cab. The front visors do not fit well in the front corners. Some of the tape is still exposed, which looks terrible. The back visors fit very well, but they make a clicking noise at highway speeds and on rough pavement. It's almost as though they tap against the window, but you can't see it while riding in the back. These are junk. Save your money. Try a different brand."
1,Made in China,"Made in China - says on back of package - (paraphrasing here) ""listed by the State of California to be made of materials containing known carcinogens"". Why would anyone buy or sell this?"
2,Disappointed,"After listening to this artist on You Tube for a year, I bought this CD and immediately knew it was a mistake...12 tracks are crammed into the CD with 1 or 2 seconds between tracks and there is no flowing for such music...the solo instrument on many of the tracks hurt my ears...I am donating it to my local thrift store and do not plan to purchase anymore Markoe CDs."
5,loved it,I bit the bullet and got one of these little guys and it was amazing. super small and bright. batteries are expensive though and battery life is short because of how bright it is so it's not really an every day flashlight.
3,A good Value,"These cones are considerable less price than others but I didn't think anything could possibly be different. Well there is, these cones are slightly thicker than a trash bag, but it really does not matter much. They are far to thin to crack like other brands and as off 3 practices the teams has not ripped them so all in all the work."
4,Great Reference,"This is a great reference book for us un-medical people. Great illustrations, simple explanations that didn't bog me down in medical terminalogy and med-speak."
3,I have kindle edition,I am very disappointed because the pictures are in black and white. It is difficult to distinguish between a muscle and another.
5,Good show!,If you like modern firearms this is a show for you! These experienced group of shooters break down the most popular modern firearms that are being used overseas. I watched it and passed it on to my shooting buddy.
5,Eclectic Late Night Dance/Groove,"A very fine first CD, comparable in overall style and excellence of composition and production to Ari Gold. Extremely listenable, and no doubt will be extensively played in dance clubs all over the world. It's a good example of the new translational style popularized in mixes by DJs such as Miguel Miggs, Ben Watt, et al. This is great stuff for playing in your car real loud, tooling down the road with all the windows open. Summer music par excellence."
1,Don't buy this!,"I was completely dumbfounded when I downloaded this item - there was no ""article"" at all! The ""citation"" in the sales copy was almost half of the entire 1-page download, which consisted of four quotations. In fact, I didn't even get any of the illustrations that were apparently in the original publication.Save your money. I truly wished that I had!"
1,machete,this was pathetic probably the worst movie i have ever seen. i bought it thinking it was a different movie with the same title. this particular machete has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. the subtitles are even misspelled
1,Garbage!,"Yet another junk supplement for the trash. States it may take a few weeks to kick in, here we are.. NADA!"
3,not sure,"I've used it for 3 weeks but not sure yet if it's the ""miracle"" I've been looking for but since you're asking to share now, that's where I'm @. :)"
4,Good,"Does work,not sure if its consistant if used everyday,or works as well if used everyday compared to Cycling it but does work,I believe if you use certain Herbs and root extracts to raise testosterone or increase Libido it is good to use it three day's on two days off.I really seem to feel the Effects from Tongkat Ali when I take it that way.I only take one Tablet a day when i take it, It is strong."
4,It might be working.,"Without any controlled observation, it's hard to tell what kind of benefit I'm getting from this supplement, because it's not the only one I'm using. But something is working. The problem is to asses the contribution of this supplement. Maybe the only way is to quit one supplement at a time for a while and see what happens. I can say one thing for sure that I don't have any side effects I feel."
1,Did nothing for me...,"I'm actually shocked that it did nothing. I had read plenty, took the right dosage, even doubled it at one point. Not a thing. Went to the doc, tested my testosterone levels, they were unchanged. If you have low testosterone, go see your doctor. That stuff works."
5,"Excellent, Could read over and over","After reading this book for a couple of PAGES I couldn't put it down. This book is so funny and full of reality. It showes real everyday life situations. But before you read this book, you should read her first book, which this is a sequel too, called """"Curtis Piperfields Biggest Fan"""
5,I love this book,"well when i read curtis piperfield's biggest fan it was automatically my favorite book, but after i read lucky me it became my favorite! i love both of these books they are awesome and i hope that lisa fiedler writes more books!"
3,product ok; Bad inside box packaging,"Tried to order a case lot (10 smaller boxes of 5000 staples each) but got 2 or 3 separate shipments. Inner boxes have no seal and because of their weight shift in the boxes. Invariably, this jostles the lid open and staples get loose in the shipping box and the strips are broken. The last order (last year), I just salvaged what I could. This time, I called and explained my frustration. In spite of a partial replacement order, it just came packed the same way and loose staple strips were found inside AGAIN. Rated it a 3 because it is somewhat the manufacturers (Bostitch) responsibility to at least put some tape on the ends of the inside small boxes. Price was okay, about a 20% savings for me. Tried to give feedback to Amazon about the need to better secure product that is that heavy without much success..."
4,Staples,The only issue I have with this item was the package it came in. The box had opened and the staples were all over the place. But the price & service were excellent.
2,Very Poor Packing - why not a full case as ordered?,"Hard to mess up staples but this order was shipped in 3 separate boxes eventhough the factory has them packed 10 to the case which was my order. One box had 10,000 staples (two boxes) broken open and loose and in another box, we were able to play 5,000 pick-up. (1 case broken)"
4,Happy with upgrade,I upgraded from 8970XL. I have used Norelco razors for over 30 years and have always been happy. It continues with this model. I especially happy with the self cleaner.
4,Good Shaver...Poor Cleaner,"I happen to like rotary shavers as opposed to foil so I happen to love this one. It's quiet, shaves fast and keeps a charge for a long time. I replaced a Braun foil which was a good shaver, but it was too loud and I didn't like how hot it became after shaving for only a few seconds. I also seemed to replace the foil more than necessary because it would break apart. One thing Braun has perfected though is the cleaning system. I don't know if Norelco decided to rush some sort of cleaner into production to compete with Braun or if it's just not as easy to design a cleaner for a rorary shaver, but the Jet Clean system is a joke and can only be understood fully by users of the Braun system. I do like the shaver though and got it for a good price on Amazon so I just put the Jet Cleaner in storage (maybe it should go in the trash :)) and I rinse the shaver under water to clean it which works very well."
2,Not impressed,Got this for xmas for my husband. He's not really all that happy with it. It ended up breaking 3 months after he got it..and it was out of warranty. I would not recommend.
2,Norelco - quiet but weak,"I have personally tried this along side the Braun and Panasonic.PROS: quiet, self cleaning, can rinse the open head to remove hairsCONS:(1) weak shaver - feels like it had a hard time cutting my beard (not all that thick) so that I had to go over areas several times(2) power switch easy to turn off during shaving(3) particles of hair stick to rubberize parts"
4,Norelco Razor,"I purchased this razor and have been very happy with the way it works. It has a long battery life and the Jet Cleaning works extremely well. It has exceeded my expectatioins.The only negatives are:1) The charging base is a little large and bulky, and the power cord makes it even more awkward.2) It is expensive but it is a top of the line product."
3,Overkill,"Did not realize when purchasing what was coming,(should have been more thorough when reading product description), huge box with multi apparatus for keeping shaver clean and sharpened. I personaly have no space or time to fuss with such an item.The Norelco 9170XLCC Razor itself is extremely good, but as mentioned above, I was punished for not reading the print about what comes with it.Overkill for an electric razor that is too expensive for what the product is, and shame on me for impulsive buying the best that is not."
3,NOT SATISFIED,"I PURCHASED THIS NORELCO CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST SHAVE I'VE EVER HAD. WRONG. IT TENDS TO PULL THE HAIR QUIT OFTEN, THEN CUT IT. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.DOUGLAS PREZZANO"
1,Nothing great,I got this as a gift for a friend. He says it dosen't shave much better than his old norelco that he bought for 60 dollars!Save your money and get a cheaper one.
3,Norelco 9170XLCC SmartTouch-XL Jet Clean Men's Shaving System,The razor is the best yet.I`ve used them for almost 50 years.The cleaning system is something else;It didn`t work and i had to send the whole set back.It`s been about two weeks and no razor.Can`t wait to get it back.
3,Almost but not quite,"I bought the 9170XLCC and I found that the shave was very superior to my old Norelco from 5 years ago.However the cleaning system seems to be buggy. I had to return the first one I got because after 2 minutes it would just blink forever.I just got my replacement and while the shaver is still great, I am having the same problem. This time I let the lights blink and eventually after about 45 minutes it said it was done. This is far more than 2 minutes."
3,The razor is good but overpriced,The razor is good but not any better than the cheaper models. See the Norelco website for the full product line and prices.
1,Pop-up trimmer pops unctrollably,"Great product if it didn't have a pop-up trimmer. I've been using Norelco's with great satisfaction for 15+ years. The floating head on this unit would be great, but the minute you float it to your face, the popup trimmer pops undesireably. Impossible to just get a shave without that darn thing popping up on you. They just designed it very poorly in that the popup trimmer is attached to the floating head, while the retaining clip to hold the trimmer in place doesn't float. Obvious design flaw. I'm sending the product back."
2,disapointed,I HAVE HAD OTHER LESS EXPENSIVE MODELS OF NOTELCO RAZORS FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN COSTS IS WORTH THE HIGH PRICE.
2,New maintenance system is unnecessary and costly...,The new continual shaver cleaning system seems to be an excuse to justify the continuing need to purchase and resupply Norelco name-brand cleaning fluid when water as used in the past will do....The new angle of shaver presentation to my face is less effective and convenient than the old....The new blade cutting system is FAR MORE EFFECTIVE AND QUICKER.
2,Norelco 9170XLCC,"The razor shaves pretty well, however, the cleaning unit did not function. When I called Norelco they told me that the likely cause was a chip in the razor unit that was not ""communicating"" with the cleaning unit -- suggesting that it's a problem that is not uncommon and that the company knows about. The replacement procedures would take up to four weeks to get a replacement razor in my hands -- leaving me without the razor in the interem -- not a good way to keep you customers satisfied.In addition, the razor uses three rubber shock absorbers that function well, but which I can see will wear down over time (and certainly well before any of the plastic components of the razor would wear out). This is poor design in my opinion.These problems have led me to return the razor for a refund. I've used Norelco razors for 30 years, but this is my last one."
2,Wasn't What I Expected,I was expecting to gain more understanding about Gnosis but instead I put the book down with less of an understanding.
1,Don't waste your money.,Poor sound quality. Can't understand the child and interviewees. Poor narration. Not enough description of what's happening.
2,Love it but can't keep it working.,I agree with D. parker of Halifax. This is my first Bluetooth mouse. I love everthing about it except that it doesn't work. I installed it and worked great for about a week then it quit. Shipped back for exchange. Second mouse I received would not pair up to my laptop when I prompted according to the instructions. My patience is running a little thin but I am going to give Iogear one more attempt. I can't be so unlucky that my third try would fail...er can I?I gave it two stars for now but I will report later on the third unit trial.
3,Tiny and fragile,"Mouse is really small and feels cheap. Buttons don't have good tactile feedback, the clicks are too soft. My fingers also overwhelm it (I don't have huge hands) and it is hard to move and then click the button without letting go of it. On the good side, it works on any surface, is easy to charge and is small to carry around,"
5,Perfect mouse for my laptop...,"I love this mouse. I use it with my iBook. I have never had any trouble with it at all. I know that some other reviews complain about how small it is...why would they buy a ""mini mouse"" if they didn't want something small?? Yes, it's small...but not too small. It's just right. Also, it works on all surfaces...I often sit in my recliner to do work and use this mouse on the arm of the chair. Buy this!"
1,Not worth it. Spend the money and get something better,"I bought this mouse for my new Dell Inspirion 9200. I loved the small size and got used to it quikly. It conencted just fine and worked great for the first few days. I made sure to charge it when the light told me to. But after the third day, I would use it and all os a sudden it would lose its connection. I would have to reconnect and then after a few minutes or half hour, it would die again. I thought it was the batteries, but it wasn't. I returned it and bought A logitech MX900. WORKS WONDERFULLY!"
2,Nice until it broke,"Used it for 2 weeks and then the on/off switch no longer turned the mouse on. I had registered it with iogear and contacted them to complain. They asked me to return it and then sent me a refurbished on that didn't work at all. Seemed like a good mouse and the price was right, but 0 for 2 has made me give the Kensington version a try."
1,still works but i hate it,my mouse hasnt broken yet but it's unresponsive when the bluetooth thingy is plugged into my computer and i hafta shake the mouse around until it starts working. battery life is horrible so i always have to recharge it. the only pro i can see is that it's small and has an on/off switch (not that it even matters).
2,Don't get this,It would drop my Imac and I would constantly have to pair it up. The battery die so quickly if you forget to turn it off when you walk away from the computer. It's TINY. And I have small hands. It's very narrow. I'm 5ft5inches. Not a big person. So you can imagine your big hands around this thing. Not a good buy.
1,Best to steer clear of this mouse.,"I bought this mouse quite a while back, and while I did like its design, feel, and utility, I did NOT like the fact that one of its internal components went bad within about 2 months. It rapidly became hard to keep linked to my computer, and soon quit working completely, to no avail. I tried alkaline batteries in lieu of its rechargables, and that did nothing helpful either. Don't buy this mouse."
3,Maddening mouse,"When this mouse works, it works well. However, unlike my other bluetooth devises this one constantly loses its pairing with the computer.I like the USB connection recharge, but I would change the supplied AAA with some energizer 950 MAHA Ni-HD's ASAP. The 600's only last a short time before requiring a recharge.Also, the label print on the bottom of the mouse wears off quickly. Less than a week of use and you cannot tell which is on and which is off.Unfortunately I gave this little headache to my mother-in-law. She now calls every night to have the mouse reconnected."
1,Do not buy -- terrible mouse!,"I'd really like my money back for this mouse -- it works, but is jumpy as heck with my Powerbook, feeling like a ball mouse with dirty contacts. I move my mouse in a straight line, but the cursor jumps, almost as if it's drunk. There are better mice out there (I like the ones I've owned by Bluetake)."
1,Hello in there!!,I had the mouse for about two months and it broke. I sent it back to iogrear and after a couple of weeks I received a mouse back but I think it was a refurb. That one worked for awhile and now the scroll wheel doesn't work. In my opinion it is a waste of money.
1,3 mice later I have a catalogue of issues.,1st mouse I had for two weeks and really loved it. Battery life seemed fine even when I left it on all day. Then when the battery died I charged it up but it never worked again. The light would come on but then go off. I tried new batteries but nothing. Returned it to the store and swapped it for a new one.2nd mouse wouldn't connect regardless of what I did. Right mouse button was also very unresponsive and felt like the spring was missing. Took it to the store and swapped it again (the same day!)3rd mouse connected no problem but the buttons had almost no response at all. Looks like they were both missing parts. I'm taking it back and honestly can't say I'm going to get another one.Real shame. It's just all quality control and build quality .
2,Decent buy takes some getting used to and a new pair of batteries,I would recommend when you don't want to carry a bulky mouse along with your laptop.I use this on a daily basis not just on trips.I've grown used to the small mouse size (its like holding an elongated walnut)BlueTooth setup was straight forward on Windows XP.You really need to keep it charging and that's difficult to do if you turn off your machine. I suggest using a powered USB HUB or USB Charger.
5,Love the L Word!!!!!,"I bought these seasons of the L Word only by reading reviews. I am so glad that I did. It is a very addictive and seductive show. I love everything about it. I can't wait until they make more seasons. I will continue to purchase these, and I recieved them very fast in the mail and they were in excellent shape. I TOTALLY recommend buying them!!!One hot and steamy show that makes you want to be part of it."
5,Beware!,"This album is great musically, and the lyrics are outstanding.It is also like most of Ginsburgs stuff fairly profane.So if you listen to this album much after you buy it, and you will, you have to be careful cause the tunes are so darn catchy you will find yourself singing them without thinking in public places, which may get you arrested!"
4,Does what you need cheap,These do exactly what you need. The only reason i did not give these pliers a 5 star was that the pins for each end piece are just a bit too big for some of the smaller snap rings. I had to file them down to get them into the 8mm and smaller snap rings. But for what we pay for them this is a small issue.
3,Caveat emptor...,"The music here is excellent. However, there is a problem with the 3rd track on amazon.com. Although it should be 14:25 as listed on this website, the mp3 is fragmentary and only 1:11 long. Until/unless this is fixed... just view this as a three-track album. If you want to buy it for tracks 1, 2, & 4, do so; it's still worth getting for those tracks. Just don't expect to get track 3."
5,A very good introduction to (instrumental) Indian classical music,"Kedar is a great evening raga and these players are really good. Its wonderful how the sound of the sitar and the violin flow into each other. The violin player is probably the best violinist in Hindustani classical music (I feel she even exceeds her aunt N. Rajam) and the sitar player is quite good as well. If you like Indian classical music, or if you want to give it a try, you can't go wrong with this one. There is more to Indian classical music than Ravishankar and its about time people realized that!"
2,Good for the price....,"I needed this system just to make people think they are observed.... a neighbor daughter that use to fool around at the main entrance with her boyfriend... yeap. I don't wanted to be their little secret dark place. The camera works perfect... it has to be a little low because the sensor is not so sensible to movement. The other alarms are for the corners and work great too. Since that system installed, the two little lovers just looked for another place for their encounters."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Piece of junk from China! Amazon should be embarrassed to even show it on their web site. Sensor won't detect motion more than 6"" if at all. All screws strip out to access battery box then you can't keep it together. Not water proof for outdoor use. Shipping costs more than product. Very misleading ad with lack of honest information. I was one of the suckers born every minute on this item. If I could rate it a ZERO I would. Anything that even looks like this one is junk! I learned my lesson. Avoid these like the plague."
3,"It is not big deal, but for the price...","It does the job, but some experts will notice it is a fake. Common people did not notice it. Common but intuitive people notices one of the flaws of the device: When detects motions, camera pans from one side to the other and sometimes stops randomly in a direction where there is nothing interesting to see and people wonder: ""why is watching that way ? There is nothing to see in that direction.""So moving the camera randomly just for detecting motion is not maybe a good idea if the camera stops moving when is pointing to a null direction."
2,Not appropriate for an Office,"I bought 6 of these cameras for our various offices and they are very noisy. They move alot, but due to the noise they make one would not be able to use them in an office environment. When they move back and forth they don't really focus at the person who activated the motion sensor, so that appeared to be very unrealistic. Their appearance from a distance might fool some, but they look very much like a toy."
1,Junk! Don't waste your money!,"As posted by the other person, this is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money. It's supposed to have a motion detector, but it's like a light sensor or something that only flashes the LED when something moves 3 inches in front of it. USELESS!. I ordered 3 of them and NONE of them worked. The sensor is supposed to make the camera swivel around like it was a real one. Nope... didn't work. Buy if you just want a fake camera to sit there but don't expect the electronics to work."
1,Pitiful,"Theres a reason they don't give you the dimensions on this product. It's 5"" long, including the ""lense"", 3.5"" tall, 3.5"" wide, with a 3.5"" stand. Looks like what you paid for. A super cheap, plastic security camera. It will be a gag white elephant gift. It's the product in the first picture shown. The other pictures are of the camera I was actually trying to purchase. I don't know the brand that makes those and I've seen them in person, they actually look like metal. Not this one"
3,Bargain but limited use,"I tried to use these cameras outside and they are not suitable for that. You have to be very close to the sensor (5') before the camera starts moving and at that distance anyone familiar with surveillance cameras will probably spot these as fakes. The sensors quit working within a matter of months, but once again I had them outside."
2,DON'T DO IT,Works sometimes. Very difficult to get the battery compartment open to change batterys. I had to take it down to remove the cover.
3,Real fake,"We know it is fake but this is terrible. Its a toy and anybody can see its a toy. You cannot prank anybody with it. If you re looking to use it for real don't buy, but if u need a toy, then go ahead"
3,looks real,Came in short order in good condition. kinda cheap looking but looks real when up. Made out of plastic. Has a red blinkinglight when its senses movement. I would not expose it to the weather. Best placed under a covered roof or soffit.
2,Motion sensor is NOT a plus,"Motion sensor makes camera house more from side to side, literally moving the camera away from any intruder that triggered the motion sensor.When the camera stops moving it will be pointing in some random direction away from entry way you want to protect.So use the decoy REMOVE batteries.Camera looks like cheap plastic not many people will believe this is a real camera."
4,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"the item arrived very quickly, it looks very realistic and oporates perfectly, picks up movements then starts panning back and forth for about 30 seconds or so, stops then starts panning again if there is more movement!"
1,Looks like a Toy,"We purchased this because it seemed to like a cheap deterent to burglars. We ordered two and, after installing batteries, neither camera works. I think it would at least be a little more convincing if the red light would be on to show the camera was on. Again out of two cameras we bought, both were defective- they don't do anything. We mounted them on our walls around our house in hopes that the fake, toy-like camera would convince at least the bad guys. It was cheap, so not worth the work to send back, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Fake camera fools adolescent thief,"I bought three of these fake surveillance cameras because we believed a twelve-year-old girl had been stealing my daughter's jewelry, make-up, and cell phone. Upon seeing these cameras she was heard to remark to her sister that she never wanted to come back to our home because she couldn't steal anymore. We used to catch her sneaking in and out of rooms, but that has stopped since the cameras were installed. Her behavior has improved to the point that she even admitted to what she took and returned what items she had not already gotten rid of.I chose to not use the batteries because the motion of the camera from side-to-side was more like a toy than a real camera.Recently, a security system salesman came into our home to attempt to sell us a system, but upon seeing the cameras he gave up and left."
1,Not too happy,I know its fake...but it looks realllly fake...I'm afraid that mounting it anywhere would only encourage thieves to pillage with reckless abandon.
1,Awful...Just Awful,I ordered 5 of these cameras. Two stopped working after less than 1 hour (about 3 people). They didn't even fool my 13 year old son.
4,"Cheap, in every aspect.","I am giving this product 4 stars(good). Anything below would be ridiculous. this item is not even a Dollar. Thats less than a piece of candy. It is not all together a great product and actually quite small (box: 2in by 4in) but it has a motion sensor light and movement and, again, super inexpensive! if you want something that looks and feels real, DONT BE CHEAP! I did not purchase this item for security reason but for art reasons instead. however if this were up somewhere i was creeping around I would believe it.Pros: CHEAP!, shipped quick, motion sensored, realistic from a distance, cheapcons: cheap plastic, not hyper real up close. pans fairly quick. also camera could pan and stop and be facing in a direction that would make it face away from desired location.All in all you get what you pay for."
5,Bang for your buck!,"I have a Keystone travel trailer that uses the euro-style overhead lights. It uses these 921 series automotive bulbs. Obviously any auto parts store will have what you need should one of these burn out, however when the cost is about $6 a pair you know you can do better. Even with shipping costs, these bulbs are MUCH cheaper than those found in stores. Now I bought these before I had a need for them so I haven't any clue of light output compared to what I have now nor life span. So I will update as these things ""come to light""."
5,For fathers and sons,"I'm sure that mothers and daughters will enjoy the book as well, but fathers and sons will get the most from it. I first read a borrowed copy of this book at age 10 back in the 1970s, and I loved it. Its praise of living leisurely, making your own fun, spending time with friends rather than parents, even doing nothing at all, seemed to validate my own boyhood lifestyle. I never forgot the book and finally bought it for myself from Amazon 30 years later.The book is now more than 50 years old, yet it seems strikingly contemporary because the trends that Smith spotted in the 1950s (structuring children's playtime, always trying to teach and ""improve"" our kids, being a ""pal"" to our kids) have only accelerated since. Smith treats everything with nostalgia and humor, making every page a joy, if a tiny bit sad.I now have a baby boy of my own, and I'm going to save my copy for him to read, years from now. I strongly recommend this book to young fathers, and fathers-to-be."
2,OK Unit,Product cleaned probably 80% of dirt w/ a 2400psi pressure washer off the driveway. Not bad but not good enough for me. you could see a big difference if you went over it again w/ the wand and nozzle.
2,"OK, I Guess","I have a 10x30 wood deck so buying the T-350 should have been a no-brainer.Well it cleaned my deck... the muddy foot prints were gone as were the bird droppings. But I bought my pressure washer to do a deep cleaning and get rid of many years of weathering in addition to the mud and do-do.I got much better results when I switched out the T-350 for a white tip. Switching to a green tip, I got the best results yet... the deck looks almost brand new.While the T-350 did do my deck in a fraction of the time, it didn't do it well enough... it was a waste of time."
4,Didn't use it,"I cannot honestly rate this product, because I didn't actually need it, I later found out that a friend had another kind that I could borrow, therefore this one was returned."
1,This is not a surface cleaner only an attachment,This was advertised as a surface cleaner - a power washer. When I finally bought a power washer and used it realize that I did not need this attachment. A WASTE OF MONEY and too late to return it.
3,Wide area surface cleaner,"I bought this produce after nine hours of cleaning my sidewalks, driveway and patio.I have not used it yet."
4,Karcher Surface Cleaner,Arrived quickly and did a great job on my driveway and sidewalks. It would be nice if it came with a water valve cut off. I would recommend to a friend.
4,Does a decent job,"Fours stars because it doesn't get the drive as clean as the pressure washer wand itself, but at the fraction of time it takes to have a nice looking clean drive. A perfectionist would not be pleased as it doesn't clean it completely but I am very pleased with how my drive looks in three hours compared to a day and a half of pressure washing every square inch with the wand. Also save several gallons of fuel."
2,Surface cleaner,"Wasted my time leaves steaks if you don't go real slow and you have to back wash when you're done, no time saver there"
