5,Information,"I want to have the information in my mail adress, when this bokk will be aviable to buy it."
2,Ick.,"I enjoy a good piece of military alt-hist, which this, unfortunately, is not. It's an interesting premise, where Hitler dies in the July 20 assasination attempt, but one that's been done too many times over. It's not even done that well. The book reads like an Arnold movie, with the hero saving the day, and the noble bad guy switches sides, and the good guys win in the end. This second part is no different. It's pretty much just the same story as the first novel, wrapped up in a different package. I give it an extra star for creativity, but this is really just absurd dreaming about what it would have been like to have Rommel on the ""good guys'"" team."
1,tiny,"The picture may not tell you that since, in the picture, there is no other object to compare the dictionary with. But be warned: this is a tiny dictionary for people with exceptionally good eyesight."
2,So so...,"This is more European Portuguese, so keep that in mind. Super small and good for travel, but I didn't get much use out of it. Just being honest."
5,The only English<->Portuguese dictionary worth owning,"Collins makes great pocket dictionaries. They have a handheld version of their Spanish Pocket Gem that sets the bar for handheld dictionaries, so buying the Portuguese Pocket Gem (paperback) was a no-brainer.It lists colloquialism, slang, pejoratives, sets important words off from others with bolding, has verb tables in the back, has a pronounciation guide for both Continental and Brazilian Portuguese as well as English (so Portuguese speakers can find the book useful as well), and so much more.The translations and definitions are very accurate and extremely helpful, and the pronounciation of each word is essential to students of either language.An exemplary representative of the Gem dictionary series."
5,"Lots of words and definitions, great price!","I was quite impressed by this tiny dictionary. I am currently in 4th semester Portuguese at a university, and so far this dictionary has been all I needed. Unlike some dictionaries that privide only one definition for the word, this one gives the commonly used synonyms as well (in both English and Portuguese). You can't go wrong for the price!"
4,Not Bad,"Not bad for pocket dictionary.Notice the absence of some words due to its compact size.Never understood how people are able to figure out how to pronounce words using a dictionary, thus don't be surprise if your pronunciation doesn't make you pass for a Brazilian.As a Portuguese speaker myself, I judge this little book can be some help for those that don't have the disposition to carry an encyclopedia collection in their backpack.good for a quick reference but not carry any deep conversation. [....]"
1,No support,"Nisus has nice software, but they will not support you. Avoid this stuff !! I wrote them about 10 times after my Nisus crashed, and they just blow you off with short e-mails. Terrible support. Avoid at all costs !!"
3,"A valiant attempt, but...","The British Invasion of 1964 gave popular music the shot in the arm it needed at the time.It introduced us to a fresh, new sound that took the country by storm. I was there to live this phenomenon, and it still amazes me how we had overlooked these groups for so long before they made their way to America.Every track is a winner here. The big problem is in the attempt to take these songs and create surround sound where it didn't exist. ""Telstar"", for example, was never released in stereo. Whether or not a true, multitrack master existed is a moot point, since this track sounds like mono out of all speakers. Some of the later tracks, where there were probably multitrack masters, sound better. But it all sounds too contrived. The high resolution stereo tracks on the DVD side sound better."
3,warning . . . embarrassment,"I sent four of these as gifts and am so embarrassed. It's not the seller's fault. It's mine. But I have always sent amaryllis as Christmas gifts and they have always come with pots and soil for forcing indoors. These DO NOT! My recipients received this bare bulb in the mail. No note from me (which I did ask to be included). Nothing but a bare bulb. As I said, this is not the seller's fault. I was doing it in a hurry and didn't read the information carefully enough. But I do think that given the fact that these are so often mailed WITH pots and soil as gifts, it would be nice of the seller to say up front: BULB ONLY. NO POT, NO SOIL. Now I have to go to Walmart and buy four of the potted ones, take out the bulbs (I'll plant them in my own garden) and mail the pots and soil to my recipients with an explanation/apology. What a pain."
2,Tangled Wires,I purchased this tool to use with a roll of 12.5 gauge high tensile smooth wire used for securing H brace fence posts together. The handles that hold the wire in place tend to turn inward as you pull the wire causing the wire to come free and then uncoiled and it quickly becomes a tangled mess. Once the wire is tangled up this tool becomes more of a hindrance than useful.
2,Not Quite What Expected,Because there was no picture to go with this CD I was unsure as to the artists being used for the CD. WHen I received the CD in the mail I saw on the back the names of the artists but when I opened the CD I found it was not the original singers (doesn't sound like it to me). I wish I would have known prior to buying the CD that it was not the original artists but who couldve known without seeing the CD. I will keep it anyway but I probably wont listen to it as often as I would have liked to.
5,Social Justice,"Discusses the health effects of lower income, poverty, capitalism, injustices, and so on. Well written. Irreplaceable text on the subject matter."
1,Nearly Useless Guide!,"SPSS offers another, highly disappointing manual. Not only have they not provide the reader with examples from templates, no explanations of the technique, and a cursory explanation of running this $300 software package. If you like to put your data into excel and then import it into SPSS, they don't even explain how, or if it can be done."
1,Terrible waste of money,"This is a useless manual that explains nothing about the conjoint algorithm, lacks any research references, and serves a less useful purpose than my Google search on conjoint can produce...even before I've had my morning coffee. Save your money. There are some nice treatments of this approach in the Sage paperback series and in some older papers in Journal of Marketing."
1,A Little Bit of Nothing,"The book is poorly written. It explains certain features of the software but not practical applications. Further, it does not explain how to interpret the findings. Overall, I feel that the book is worthless!"
3,Just the facts,"I had previously read this book in my senior high school year and it greatly increased my intrest in physics and helped my bring my grade up to a C+ by the end of the year. I'm not a physist but the corilations made in this book will make you think about the way the univers is actually put together and how it is perceived. Kenneth likes to fill the pages with numbers, but if you like to crunch them it can be fun. This is a book for the more serious reader and be perpared you will not find more books by this aurthor and its real hard to find books that don't use the word quantum."
3,bad disk?,"As a collector of Arabic study materials, I have no objection with the method used in the video to teach simple phrases with lots of repetition. The problem i had viewing it was that the DVD kept hanging up and stopping. Maybe it needs a good cleaning, I'll try that before watching it again, but that shouldn't be needed with a new product. I am thinking the manufacture is shoddy, it is just a bad disk that stops a lot. My player plays all other disks fine, not this one. Buyer beware! I hope it plays clean next time."
1,My Best Advice....,"SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS for a box of badges. After a couple years these cheap plastic badges were so shriveled and lumpy that they were an embarrassment to hand out to our guests! Even with the card placed in, they would not uncurl! They looked like I stored them in water! I was so disgusted I wrote to Avery and they ignored my concerns. I guess I'd have to pay hundreds to expect quality. Obsurd! If you buy them, use them up right away, or better yet, stay away from them! It's a huge rip off!"
5,Great Jazz/New Age Fusion!,"I must admit I'm new to the artists, but certainly not to the genre. For years I've been watching a program on EWTN called ""The Journey Home"", and they use the track ""River of Grass"" as their intro/outro theme. I've always felt that track had a smooth, almost Pat Metheny vibe to it, especially with the vocals layered on top of the melody.I downloaded the whole CD and gave it a thorough listen, and have enjoyed the other tracks as well. Standouts are ""Amigos"", which has an unmistakable Cuban/Latin flavor, and ""Long Key Schooner"", which has such a seafaring character that you can almost imagine the salty sea spray and wind at your face! They do an excellent job at evoking those hot, lazy days in the Keys and Everglades! Love it enough where I might have to start collecting their other works as well. Great standout effort, and well worth adding to your collection!"
1,Like The Title--Distatseful,"A small work of distasteful stories that exploits the underbelly of human experience. This is a book for the dispirited and those without hope. It is no more than a breadcrumb trail of dispair masquerading as nourishment--it substitutes irony for redemption, craft for insight. If you want to be depressed and pretend you are thinking, better get a mediocre bottle of scotch and smack it a against your head instead of spending time with this little book."
5,Old-fashioned stories of high quality,"Epstein's work is old-fashioned in the best sense of the term. There is no ""writers' school"" trendiness here. Each story packs in a lifetime of detail about one or more characters, with plots that dwell on similar themes: Jews growing up in Chicago, illness and death, family tensions, the debt to high culture. On the surface this may seem repetitious, but it never is. Indeed, the literary cohesion of the stories is one of the charms of this collection -- it is not all over the place. Curiously, it reminds me in some ways of the stories of Louis Auchincloss; even though their two ethnic milieus are far apart, both writers share a profound sense of the moral dimension of life. This moving work is sensitive, humorous, gripping. In 340 pages we get the stuff of twenty novels, all propelled by a power of description that is continuously engrossing."
5,FABULOUS!,"An absolute jewel of a book.Each story brings to life a unique and wonderful character. Men I must have known or met, men I lived with and/or next door to. My father, my uncle or yours. Each recognized and loved with all their flaws.I have a plan to purchase six FABULOUS SMALL JEWS, send each to a good friend and invite them to one book meeting to talk about and share the experience of this very special book."
5,A companion to Philip Roth,"These small stories are small gems that transcend religion and locale (Chicago) to touch the heart and mind of serious lovers of literature, and of the examined life!A book club favorite!"
4,Great resource (though dated.) Some files on CD's may not load,"This was a great book in its time, and still provides solid understanding of CSound fundamentals. Much has changed in the last decade, and you're better off working with a more recent software version. Even so, some of the strangenesses in current versions make more sense when you see how the system evolved.As great a resource as this is, it's difficult to convey so much technical material while making sure to explain everything before using it. With a bit of patience, technical readers can put the pieces together. I subtract a rating star only due to technical obsolescence, as of 2009.Though the CD's in my (used) copy looked good, many files on them did not load under Windows. I suspect this may be due to insufficient testing across multiple OS'es. Once you see what is supposed to be there, you can probably find reasonable replacement material (also more up to date) on the listed web sites.Happy composing!"
2,Csound(necessary software),"Book came on time, no problem. Book came in great condition, also no problem. Book comes without cd software which is explicitly stated in the product review. I am teaching myself Csound, I am not taking the class thus, the learning curve becomes that much more unnecessarily difficult. The software is paramount to my education of this computer language. I returned the product twice, second time I asked for a refund. Why be mislead by faulty descriptions through a third intermediary? I'll just pay the additional cash(15 dollars) and have it shipped directly from MIT press."
2,could be better,"this is a date from late 1971. The recording isn't that great, the lead guitar of Jerry Garcia seems kind of low in the mix. His tone is kind of weak, he's playing a stratocaster. Phil sounds good, but again, the overall sound isn't of the highest quality. The vinyl version doesn't seem to add anything. I'd pick another date, another concert."
4,Swifter Vaccuum,I ordered this product and am very pleased and I would do it again. The only drawback is how long the vacuum stays charged. It will do 2 to 3 rooms thenthe battery has to be plugged in again for several hours. But over all forthe price and it's so light weight I would get it again.
2,Doesnt live up to the hype,"""Open Water"" floats to the bottom like a piece of chud. What seems like a suspenseful movie, in the end yurns into to a movie with no plot and even less of a script. Is is freaky? yes. But that doesnt make it good and ""Open Water"" can hardly stay afloat for its 80 plus minutes."
3,Decent Film,This is the type of film you have to go into with an open mind. Not bad if you can turn your brain off for an hour and a half.
1,Great idea...,"...executed very poorly. And not because of the low-budget. A lot of low budget films work beautifully if the director knows what he's doing, but in this case he's clueless. What's with all the gratuitous close-ups? There are so many of them at the top of the film that, later on, the close-ups that should matter...don't. And I'm sorry, if I'd been bobbing up and down in the water for four hours, I wouldn't be playing word games; the dialogue, for the most part, is ridiculously unbelievable. There are some chilling moments, but that's due to the situation in which these people find themselves, not anything that the filmaker is doing. This is a renter, folks, don't waste your money. (The actors, by the way, do admirably under the circumstances. But poor Blanchard Ryan...was it really necessary to shoot her nude?)"
1,Open Water,"I thought this movie was based on true events, but it turns out the only true part we know for sure is that two American's went out with a group of people for some scuba diving and were left behind and never seen again, that's it! I felt misled, I wished I would have read what other people that saw the movie or had already bought it had to say, I would have saved my money."
2,Open Wide and Say Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"...or A Day in the Life of a Couple Stranded in the Ocean. Realistically, what can happen in such circumstances? Though the direction and cinematography succeed in creating the dizzying surge of the sea, there is so little plot that it emerges as nothing more than a psychological study of a man and woman in the throes of increasing despair. The characters are flat, the dialogue dull, and the out-of-the-ocean action as monotonous as the expanse of the sea itself."
1,don't bother,"Whenever the commerial for the dvd comes on i have to laugh, they actually say in the commercial that this movie is as scary as Jaws. They must be kidding, Jaws is top notch and the mechanical shark in it was more scary than the real deals in this boring, terribly acted movie known as open water.I rented it out of curiosity and basically fast forwarded through most of it to look for the ""good parts"" except i found none. Please don't waste your time on this movie unless you have absolutely nothing to do. Give me Chief Brody anyday!"
2,I'm underwhelmed,"I am seriously disappointed based on all the build-up of this movie, but I guess I shouldn't have believed the hype. It is closer to ""Blair Witch"" than to ""Jaws."" No, it's not even as good as ""Blair Witch.""Sure, there are some creepy and suspenseful moments, but in the end this feels more like a filmed adaptation of a Reader's Digest ""Drama in Real Life."" There was a palpable emotional distance throughout that kept me wanting something engaging to take place. Maybe the fact that it is all digital, and thereby ""virtual,"" makes it feel cold, small, the characters less human, and the story less compelling.If the filmmakers had provided just a morsel of the real story, even if that meant they had to reveal how ""loosely based"" this rendering actually is compared to the facts, I might have found it more profound, and yes, more frightening. Else it is just conjecture with a digital camera.**"
2,Blair Fish Project,"This film came with almost as much hype as Blair witch and was almost as awful. Most of the film is fluff and filler with alot of nice cinematography over and under the water. The two leads are as bland as sand. To bottem line....""Jaws"" was probably 20 times more expensive, and 30 times more entertaining. Proves that money sometimes can buy happiness."
2,Don't be late for the boat in open water.,"Released in 2003. Running time: 79 minutes.Daniel (Daniel Travis) and Susan (Blanchard Ryan) are a couple on a vacation. They go deep sea scuba diving with a group of 20. A boat worker miscounts how many deep sea divers have returned on board and they leave. Our couple does not make it to the surface until 40 minutes later. The boat is gone. The cold water is filled with sharks.Followed by:Open Water 2 - Adrift (Widescreen Edition)(2006).May I recommendJaws (30th Anniversary Edition)(1975),Jaws 2(1978),Jaws 3(1983),Jaws - The Revenge(1987).Audio in English 6.1 DTS ES, English 5.1 Dolby Digital EX, English 2.0 Dolby Surround.Option of subtitles in English, Spanish.Special Features: Theatrical Trailer, deleted scenes, 3 featuretes."
3,In the company of sharks,"Filmed on digital video, Open Water is designed to be like a documentary except we are living the actual fear with the two leads. A married couple set forth on a much needed holiday and end up being left behind on a day out snorkelling trip. I had heard mixed reviews of this film, but am happy to report that I enjoyed it very much. Okay, it's not perfect but the tension was there and I found myself feeling truly sorry for them. Based on true events, Open Water in an interesting take on the shark theme .... well worth at least one viewing. Probably not worth purchasing on DVD though."
4,Effectively chilling,"If you liked Blair Witch Project and My Dinner with Andre, you'll probably like Open Water. Not that you will 'enjoy' this movie; it's not supposed to be a pleasant experience for the audience. But it's definitely chilling. I personally think that low budget (i.e., amateur) films achieve this sort of thing better than slick, big budget movies, which typically aren't intimate enough. Open Water isn't Jaws, but so what? Do all movies have to be grand in scale and scope?"
3,Short Entertaining Film,"For a low budget flick, this movie is decent and does the job of entertaining the viewer for a little over an hour. The majority of the film takes place in the ""Open Water"" with a minimal cast so its short time length is a major plus. It is not a movie made for big effects with scary gruesome torture scenes. It is more along the lines of a psychological thriller and if you have ever been in the ocean or are afraid of sharks, you will be scared. The thought of being left by a diving boat in the middle of the Ocean is (mentally) scary enough and is the true event that inspired this movie."
3,"Not the greatest, but commendable","Overall not the best film I've seen, and the ending was a bit unfulfilling, though I won't ruin it by telling you why. This is certainly not an award winning picture in my book, but there have been worse.What I find commendable is the fact that Chris Kentis (writer, director and editor) and his wife filmed this movie over the course of two years, during vacation trips. He had to continue working his full-time job to bring in money to cover production costs.Aside from some unecessary nudity and not-so-good acting (I could tell from the beginning that this was a semi-amateur film) the movie was okay, and did have some great scenery and creative shots, and at least the leading lady was cute. The sharks were cool too, and there were tons of them, though not enough underwater shots for a shark lover like me to enjoy.In all not the best film you'll ever see, but not the worst. It has its moments."
4,The second-best shark movie of all time,"Although it lacks the flair and power of Spielberg's masterpiece, Open Water stands up well against the classic Jaws. Like the older movie, Open Water's tension comes more from the little moments and the all-too-human reactions to a terrifying situation.But if it doesn't have Spielberg's masterful touch, Open Water does have far more plausibility to it than Jaws ever did. (I've been left behind, briefly, by a dive boat myself, although they never got out of sight.) The terror of realizing how alone, how exposed and how vulnerable they are is where the icy horror of this movie comes from. It's not a thriller in the traditional sense, and is more disturbing than actually scary.Definitely worth viewing for fans of Jaws, divers and those afraid to dive ..."
3,Creepshow 2 was better!!!!!,Creepshow 2 have a small story wicth is pretty much like this movie! Is fiction but is even MORE SCARIER AND CREEPY than this movie.Adios.
3,Midioca Film,This film is quite good apart from the wide range of bordem that posses the film through certain bits. It is a very good for a low budget film.Bexhill high school is crap don't go there.
1,Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,"First off the one star I gave is being overly generous. This movie was the most boring, unscary, uninteresting waste of time. I saw it on FX right now and I was excited to see it at first because the trailer always made it seem interesting. I thought it was going to be a mix of Blair Witch project and Jaws. To compare those two amazing movies to this flaming piece of trash would be an injustice. I dont mind low budget movies as long as they are interesting but this thing was awful. There are zero scares and zero laughs. The whole movie I kept waiting for something good to happen and before I knew it, the movie was over and I had lost 2 hours I will never get back. Worst of all whoever does the star ratings for movies shown by Time Warner should be fired for giving this movie 3 stars. Please listen to me when I say don't even waste your time watching this movie on TV. I hope the guy that made this movie never worked in Hollywood again after this garbage."
4,"a thriller that delivers, but it is sad","Bleak, tense, gruesome and sad. This is well-shot with a combination of guerrilla camera work and more thoughtful and expensive cinematography. The story follows the fate of two married divers left behind after a mistaken head count for the day-trippers.There is an objectionable theme of futility and abandoning hope, yet this tragedy is compelling although depressing. The characters are well-drawn and their humanity and ordinariness contributes to the tension...these aren't heroes facing imaginary monsters, these are ordinary people facing an all-too-possible challenge."
3,This movie disappointed me,"Ithink something else should have been added to this movie, I don't know exactly what, but the ending surprised me! I was mad!I'm glad I didn't go to the theater. This movie was not that scary to me but it was a little tense."
3,It was alright,"I know the film makers were going for a certain look in this film but the ultra cheap camera work really took me out of the movie. It wasn't so bad once the couple got in the water but all the camera work on land was horrible. The editing and sound looked like it was a student film. And if you watch the making of the film you'll see how much money was spent on it. Where did all that money go? I hope it wasn't spent on those horrible actors. And I gotta say, the couple in the water were very calm for a long period of time even though they were stranded in the middle of nowhere. I would have been panicked from the moment I noticed I was left behind. And even though this is based on a true story, the only true part about it is a couple was left behind once. Everything else is completely made up. They could have washed up on a deserted island for all anybody knows and they're still living there right now. That would have been a better ending for this movie I think."
3,ORIGINAL & TENSE BUT..........BLEAK AND DEPRESSING!,"Watching this film, I will admit it kept my interest and it was quite gut wrenching to think something like this could happen. Let's get this out of the way right now.......this is not a shark attack movie and it is not in any way similar to 'Jaws'! This is a movie about being stuck in a situation with only a snow ball's chance in H E L L of surviving! It's a very depressing film and you will feel it long after the credits role......is it entertaining?......not in my book. I do own this DVD just so, I can depress some of my friends whenever I get the notion!:-D !"
2,Open Water.......,"Although I enjoyed this movie, I gave it a 2 star rating only because I've seen much better movies that I've given 3 star ratings. I know this was a cheaply made and filmed movie and can get boring at times, however I can't say that this was a waste of time. I love shark movies and NO, you can not even begin to compare this movie to Jaws... but I enjoyed the fact that this movie keeps you guessing as to what will happen to this couple who get left behind in shark infested waters by a tour boat while they were going scuba diving. I found the ending quite sad.....with him dying and she ended up giving in and taking her own life rather than be eaten by sharks. Although not a non stop suspense film, it was worth renting."
2,"BASICALLY, 2 DIVERS LEFT AT SEA","I'm sure this is every diver's fear, to be taken out to sea and left behind. This is an indie film effort that is short on story, short on plot, and not all that scary. There are some tense moments with the sharks, but there is nothing else going on. The view is dumped in the water with the divers and that's all that happens. There is anger, denial, and acceptance. And ought to tell you all you need to know about the ending of this movie.Look for something with greater length and plot if you're looking for scares. You can get the same sense of discomfort from Discovery Channel.The extras were pretty dull and ho hum. They should have cut a lot more out and added a story. Not recommended, even for hardcore horror fans."
2,it was nothing compare to deep blue sea,the movie sucks because thre is no aventure in the movie it all stays the same.in real life the shark would already kill the couple in the first couple of hours.the ending of the movie sucks too.if you want to buy a good shark movie go buy deep blue sea it will never bored you like open water.I gave the movie 2 stars because some parts of the movie are well done and some parts really look like a real thriller.
1,thank goodness for fast-forward!,"When this film was first released theatrically, most of the reviews raved about ""suspense"". I personally found it dull and absurd. I wasn't expecting ""Jaws"" but I wasn't expecting this dreck (and beleive you me, I have sat through some real stinkers!). I fast forwarded through much of the movie and was glad that it was a free rental (Blockbuster Rewards). I would give this movie ZERO stars, but will graciously give it one because of the nude scene!"
1,total waste of time and money,"I would not even waste your money on a rental. Total waste of time. I would have been more entertained pulling weeds in my lawn. If anyone wants my copy, I will send it to you for free. You pay the postage and you can have it!"
5,Movie Making as an Art,"""Open Water"" is one of the best movies ever made, period. Nothing blows up and there is no overacting."
1,Uhm . . . no!,"A husband and wife team are left behind after deep sea diving in shark infested waters.The film offers a couple thrills, but that's about it. Lots of floating around. Either fast forward one hour or pass on this one--seriously."
2,drowning in boredom,"Nope - this movie didn't work for me. Clearly a cheapie indie flick, there is a cast of two and most of the shown set is in the water. The director tries to build the suspence by raising the volume of the soundtrack at key moments but it comes across as contrived.Truly, wasn't frightened at all and in fact drowing in boredom. If you want a suspence flick, you can surely do better elsewehere."
2,Deep Blue Sea was much better,"potentiol...this movie had probably the most out of any movie this year...but it failed, in my eyes, miserably! this is supposed to be a shark movie but we are only encountered by a couple of scenes with a couple of sharks...disappointed. I was so eager to see this movie and i get it home and i get into it and my hopes are high by the time the couple are left in the sea...but im so angry that there are so few shark scenes in this movie! and the ending just killed it for me! I understand it but..i dont like it. It could have been developed more and stretched out and this movie could have been great! I do, however, give massive credit to the scenes shot at night in the thunder storm. You see lightening flashing and you hear voice overs of the characters panting and saying something rubbed up against their leg and its just a great scene and i loved it. thats the only reason this gets 2 stars from me...otherwise...this is a 1 star, easily forgettable, cheap movie"
1,one of the worst moview ever made,"Poor acting, writing, editing and especally directing make for one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The director had no idea what he wanted to do with what could have been a good movie. Very low budget and looked rushed. Something a college student might have made. Think Blair Whitch meets Jaws III and you have a good idea what to expect."
2,really really REALLY bad,"i find myself asking why this movie was even a thought in someone's head. i understand that it was low-budget, but it was also low-fun. i've seen better movies made from even lower-budgests.the basic idea was good, but it lacked, um....everything. it's about a couple who take a rushed vacation and end up scubba diving. there is a miscount on the boat that they are on, and they are stranded at sea. the rest of the movie is about how the couple float around in the ocean with sharks circling them. will they live or die?the movie lacks events. you only see a shark face once and a few shots of it's fins. the movie would be a lot better if something other than floating would happen."
1,shark movie?,What the movie had verry litle to do with sharks only a few scences had some sharks but they only lasted 2 minutes the rest was people in the water talking about how they made a mistake coming on this boat from the comercials i was thinking how could they make a movie about people stranded in the sea it sounded like a short films you know the ones that last like thirty minutes i was wondering it dosnt sound verry action packed but i still got it and it was terrible.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Thinking back on it now, I can't even begin to fathom why I sat through this horrible excuse for a movie. The plot sucks, the characters are laughable (not to mention extremely annoying) and, well it's just plain......boring. So here it is, in a nutshell:1. Overworked couple decides to go to a tropical vacation spot.2. Overworked couple arrive at said tropical vaction spot and decide to go scuba diving.3. Overworked couple go diving, are miscounted by the diving guide and spend the next hour floating in the middle of the ocean, bickering and getting picked at by various sea creatures.4. After getting picked at for a while, the overworked couple dies. He gets eaten and she drowns herself.So there you have it folks, one of the worst films ever, reduced down to four (yes four) easy to follow steps. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this."
1,"Boring, boring, boring!","This film is basically just 2 people having a domestic in the middle of the ocean. There is absolutely no suspense as it's pretty obvious what's going to happen - I just wish the sharks had finished them off a lot sooner.Also from a scuba diver's perspective, I found there were a lot of niggly mistakes that soon became very irritating.A poorly made film - don't waste your time on it."
4,Brief But Honest Review,"I really liked this movie. The angle of the camera, sound effects were perfect in open waters. The panic experienced by the divers in shark infested water made the movie believable...similar to JAWS. The movie startles the imagination and will leave one asking, ""What would I do in this situation...give up or start praying!"
1,This movie sucks!,"The first twenty minutes of this film reminded me of a poorly made ""B"" movie, and then it's all downhill from there. There is nothing good that I can say about this movie except that it does finally end, after sharks eat both the stars of the movie. I'm just glad that I didn't spend $10.00 to see it while it was in theatre release, that would have pissed me off."
2,Lots of potential here,"Unfortunately,not much of it is tapped. I don't want to say the film is terrible; it does have its moments. But as a whole, I'm afraid a number of others are right; it DOES get boring and/or disjointed in spots, and after a while, you begin to stop caring. That any charter could be THAT incompetent is implausible. Still, despite its flaws, you do find yourself wanting to find out how things end up. The ending is definitely a bit of a twist. BUt it's not the kind of film you'd ever watch again, simply because it's not that good. Bottom line: the acting is horrible, and that what ultimately kills this. The little tantrums, the calm resolution, the ""maybe maybe not"" scene. all were extremely amateurish and sometimes almost laughable. If you want to see this, rent it."
1,This movie was...I have no idea,"When I first saw this movie I was in shock of it and how things like this could happen. I really hate this movie and everything about it. I know many people who love it and I didnt even buy this movie for me, I bought it for my sister because she loves it. I cant stand it."
2,This was very disappointing given the reviews,"All of the great reviews this movie received raised my expectations. However, I have to tell you that it really never lived up to anything the critics said. Oh, there was some quirky photography, and there were sharks. And I am willing to go along with the progression of the couple in the water as they struggled for survival, but it never ever got to the level of fear the reviews led me to believe was there.Worse yet, the end of the movie is just a botch. I will not spoil anything, but I would be surprised if you like it. The movie is less than 90 minutes and it still loses its way in the middle, but right before the end it seemed to be gearing up for a big finish. Instead, it just gives up. Awful.There is a lot of talent that went into this low budget film and I respect that, but this was a huge disappointment for me.Not recommended."
4,A little slow..................... but good.,I have to say this wasn't the best shark movie ever..... It was very slow....... Besides that...... It was good! It wasn't as good as Shark Zone or JAWS or any of those Shark movies......
1,Not for the average movie watcher,"My wife & I expected a lot more - perhaps ""entertainment"". After 80 minutes it didn't deliver, poor music, shots to make you dizzy (I had to look away often), and just a real let down of an ending. Afterwards a movie should make you feel like you enjoyed something, this made me feel like I wasted my time. All the rave reviews on the box! I don't feel the movie lived up to them."
1,Its The Blair Witch Project....in the water.,Two scuba divers get left in the ocean and float along hoping that sharks don't eat them. Wow...thrilling. Nothing happens in this move...the plot is paper thin and the acting is even worse. Not to mention the sea sick feeling you get from the $100 camera that they strapped to a raft to film this piece of garbage. Don't waste your time...
2,Boy was I scared...of how bad it was,"First off, the screenplay is weak, if not downright nonexistent. The cinematography and camera work of the pseudo-home camera variety was annoying at best, insufferably nauseating at worst. Was it scary? If you consider two marginal actors with no depth and no screenplay to work with floating around in the middle of the ocean being chased by sharks to be scary, then yes. If you have half a brain, then no.Perhaps the only saving grace is that Blanchard Ryan is a hot number and makes viewing this drivel for the wasted 81 minutes somewhat tolerable."
3,When on water good....when on land bad.,"First off let me start by saying that my number one fear is being stranded in the ocean with sharks so this movie already had a place in my heart. The movie is no masterpiece by any means, but it did indeed invoke a fear in me while I watched it that I haven't felt in a long time. However there are several genius scenes that are effective ie: thunderstorm and schools of sharks"". There were many times I jumped throughout, usually from a shark popping up. The acting isn't oscar caliber but I felt it was passable enough. To me this should have just been a 30-45 minute film that only took place in the water like a documentary. Anyways I like it, but again only because that is one of my fears, I can understand how others would think it was terrible. So basically to put it straight out: If you are afraid of sharks and the ocean this movie will probably effect you like it did me, just don't expect too much when you view it so your expectations won't be too high."
3,It's just a drag,"This was an okay movie but nothing really happened....You never saw what was happening on the island or on shore....All it was, was a bunch of talking and screaming and the ending just plain sucked...."
3,"Water, water everywhere...","Slow-moving by the standards of attention-deficit mainstream action movies, this microbudget, primarily two-character drama gets under your skin and into your psyche. Its nightmarish premise--a vacationing couple are accidentally left behind while scuba-diving and must fend for themselves in the middle of the ocean--is played more as a psychological study than as a horror/suspense thriller. Yes, there are menacing sea creatures, but don't expect ""Jaws 5"" (even though rabid ""Jaws"" fans will pick up on an allusion to that now-30-year-old blockbuster, as I did). Do expect something comparable to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" which similarly depicted the toll that fear and isolation can take."
3,Very low budget flop.,This is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It looks more like a reality movie and also bad acting. It was scary to see two people right in the middle of a big huge ocean. What was dissapointing at the end when the man lost too many blood from getting bitten by sharks and that jelly fish he died then the woman just gave up and drag herself down in the water.
1,Slow and boring,"Feels like a low budget film. Not much imagination or creativity in making it. I can see this really happening, but it's not something I would make a movie about. Maybe a documentary. Feels very much like Blair Witch Project, except a lot slower and more boring. I guess I've seen worse, but not too many."
2,This was supposed to be scary???,"I watched this on Showtime over the weekend expecting all of the hype it received during the Summer of 2004 would somehow pay off. It didn't.This movie (a-la-BLAIR WITCH PROJECT-style-film making) offers no real fear or scares in the water (with the small exception of the lightning storm in the middle of the night). Between the couple's constant bickering and the beautiful sunny day all around them, it leaves very little to the imagination in creating the idea of what to be afraid of in the open water.One little piece of JAWS-related homage I will offer that I have not seen mentioned by other reviewers; in the scene where the boat master pulls out the couple's identity cards from the their pack, the fulls names on the cards are Susan WATKINS and Daniel KITNER. Watkins and Kitner are the last names of the first two characters attacked and killed in JAWS, both book and movie.Am I the only one who noticed that?"
1,ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz..........................,"WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE SOME KIND OF 5TH RATE JAWS 3D?!?!?!?!?HOW LAME CAN A MOVIE GET?!?!?!?!?!?OF ALL OF THE DULLARDS THAT WAS EVEN REMOTELY SCARED IM SURE 99.99999999999999% WERE WOMEN(WOMEN SQUEAL AT A BUGS SHADOW SO THAT EXPLAINS IT)sorry for the cap's but i cant get past the FACT that no one got hurt in SHARK INFESTED WATERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!so whats so scary about this movie?!?!?!?!?!?!?why are critics falling over themselves is a rush to be the 1st to praise this garbage?!?!?!?!?!?!?!and why is this rated R?!?!?!?!?!?OH,THATS RIGHT.BECAUSE OF FOUL LANGUAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!if the roughest part of a''horror''movie is its language........then women should never leave the house.why are women so damned fragile and easy to scare?!?!?!?!?!?they probably hid under their seats if they went to see shrek..........LMMFAO@easily scared women."
2,Two IDIOTS floating in the ocean...,For the love of God. After 1 hour you have to realize that the boat is not coming back. Pick a freaking direction and SWIM. I'm sure the dive watches have a compass on them. What does it accomplish just FLOATING there!??!!?Extremely irritating.
1,FALSE AD FOR SURE!! NOT BASED ON TRUE EVENT AT ALL!!!!!!,"WHAT MADE ME THE MOST MAD BESIDES THE WORST ENDING IN THE WORLD IS THAT I WAS LEAD TO BELIEVE THAT THESE SO CALLED ""EVENTS"" GOING ON FOR 22 HOURS REALLY HAPPENED TO THESE PEOPLE, BUT REALLY THEY COULDN'T HAVE POSSIBLY KNOWN ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO THEM. SO AS SOMEONE ELSE COMMENTED, YOU HUNG ON TO THEM FOR NOTHIN' CAUSE THEY JUST ARE KILLED, THEY PROBABLY GOT ATE BEFORE THE BOAT EVEN TOOK OFF. HOW LAME TO SAY ""BASED ON TRUE EVENTS"" COME ON! I WANTED, NO NEEDED TO SEE THAT SCUBA COMPANY GO DOWN A FEW MILLION OR SO AND CLOSE DOWN AT LEAST!!!"
1,Boring beyond all belief.,"I have seen very few movies in my life that did not have at least some value, probably less than you can count on one hand. I am not hard to please in that respect. This movie might top them all for no value.About 95% of the movie involves a husband and wife left several miles offshore from a diving expedition. The other 5% is them loading their car for their vacation and the trip out for the dive. There is no scenery except, as the movie title shows, open water. During their few hours in the water, they go through all the emotions from fear, anger, regret, joy, etc. They blame each other for their predicament and fight and then they remember that they love each other. Then it ends. If a one-and-a-half hour soap opera with only two characters, no scenery and a bad ending appeals to you, get this movie. If not, don't waste your time."
4,A nasty piece of work,"Not a great movie, but a very very good movie, that does exactly what it needs to do with the minimum amount of resources. As a two-hander, both leads are fine actors; the set up is brief and concise, and the premise is astonishlngly terrifying, considering how simple it is. I found myself longing for any shot of dry land just to relieve the terror of the watery isolation; their arc exactly matched that of the human condition; lighthearted, followed by bravery, followed by fear, followed by despair, fololowed ultimately by stoic acceptance. Daniel has all the male strengths, and weaknesses, and Susan has all the female strengths and weaknesses, and their stories describe the human gender arc. The film is a microcosm of hope, fear, life, death and the savage world, and if you're afraid of deep water, you're in for the ride of your life."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I didn't know a thing about this film when I sat down to watch it - just assumed it had something to do with water. At the opening scene, like most of the other reviewers, I too thought ""Low budget. Great."" However it didn't take me long to realize that ""Hey. These people are saying the same things and acting the same way my husband and I would in this situation."" Although the movie was low budget, its dialogue and acting were more realistic than most recent films I've viewed.I didn't mind the slow action or the lack of suspense. I didn't even mind the ending because I realize that death does not have to have a readily apparent meaning. Although this film was not action-packed or leave me with a sense of satisfaction, I would recommend it to anyone willing to watch something just a little bit different than the norm."
3,War of the world,"Like a reality show, but the drama is to close to a real tragedy here. Two typical white Americans are left alone in the middle of the ocean, and a lot of sharks threaten them. Maybe is a response to the fear of Americans to the foreign. The foreign here is an animal force, a force of nature, which you can't argue with. An earlier scene shows how our heroes kill a little bug on their hotel room, at night. Are ""the bugs"" getting back at them?"
1,"Very disappointing movie - rent it maybe, don't buy it","Here was a film that hyped enough to get initial sales but no word of mouth follow-up ... I thought I would love this movie and I was VERY disappointed. The movie is clever and fairly well made for the independent genre, but the ending SUCKED!spoiler alert:If you're a Stephen King-type fan that likes to see all the stars die in a movie, you'll like this film. But the stupid idiots GIVE UP ... gee, good film about the ability of people to FAIL under extreme pressure. If I wanted to see that on my TV screen, I'd forget the movie and just watch the local and national news. It is what I'd show my kids NOT to do in life.One nude scene that little to nothing to do with anything, other than a draw for the teenage male ... it's about ""coitus interruptus"" and the plot makes you feel the same way ...The only people who like this film may use it as a style of learning how to shoot digital movies ... as far as substance goes, waste of time."
3,one that i almost didnt watch,ONE I ALMOST DIDNT WATCH BUT GLAD I DID.THE SUSPENSE WAS GREAT. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS VERY GOOD FOR A LOW BUDJET FILM.
3,Hmmmmm,"Somewhat suspenseful but falls short of expectation.The scariest part was also the shortest. Alone in the ocean in complete darkness with only the lightning in the sky to provide visibility is terrifying. Too bad it only lasted about 3 minutes.There were plenty of boats around, yet they chose not to swim towards them. Wouldn't they eventually headed towards shore and thus provided a direction for the forgotten swimmers?"
4,Just When You Thought The Water Was Safe...,"Afternoon swim, anyone? Not after this movie thank you very much. Based on a true story of a couple who are left behind on a scuba dive to fend for themselves in the ocean. A very intense movie. I was on the edge of my seat watching this film. It actually feels like a documentary because it seems so real. No fancy sets, costumes, or a lot of actors for that matter. Just the two of them in the water, waiting, hoping... then they realize that they are NOT alone. SOMETHING is in the water with them and it's getting hungry. A great character study AND a voyage into fear. Beautifully filmed and brilliantly acted."
1,Don't waste your time,"A couple is stranded in the ocean by an inept scuba tour and find themselves harassed by sharks and jellyfish. This goes on for about 90 minutes, and there is very little in the form of a storyline, and even less substantive dialogue. I mean, there isn't much your characters can discuss when they're bobbing in the open water for 12 hours. But the intensity picks up when one of them discovers some hard candy in her dive vest. Hopefully, you won't be in at the snack bar during this monumental moment.My advice is to skip this one and rent Jaws instead, even if you've seen it a dozen times. Your 13th viewing of Jaws will still be better than this movie. But if you do decide to see this one, then bring along something for seasickness, because the camera is constantly bobbing up and down with the actors. Aside from nausea, there was nothing that I got from this movie."
2,BLAIR WITCH Shell Game,"Going into this movie, I thought it was going to be about two self-involved yuppies who are taught by Nature what's really important in Life after they're accidentally left out to sea.But it wasn't. Unfortunately, it wasn't anything really that good either. This couple goes through the stages of disbelief, dismay, turning on each other, desperately holding onto to each other, struggling to survive--all that stuff, but with no major or interesting revelations.The film had a cheap camcorder look to it, so I was thinking (because of its critical praise) I would something special through the writing or acting. But no. Another BLAIR WITCH shell game.The ending made me feel like I had just wasted however many minutes I'd put into this movie.The wife looked great naked though."
1,YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!,"Okay, people, I have a quick story to tell...My significant other came in with this movie, we popped some popcorn and poured ourselves a few drinks to go along with it. My daughters came upstairs and we thought, what the heck, let's make it a family movie night. Within the first thirty minutes of watching this, I seriously thought it was a joke. We all burst into laughter and waited for something that was going to make us, ""jump out of our skin."" As the credits rolled up at the end, I was stunned. More so, in disbelief. This was the worst movie I had seen throughout my entire thirty-seven years of living. The one star is for effort, which there was very little. The reviews and cover is designed to hype you up and make you think this movie is the bomb. Trust me, it's not. Save your money, and save the popcorn and drinks for a movie that's worth it. Maybe next time, huh?"
4,Just imagine being in that situation!,"People who write reviews here sometimes i dont understand what they are thinking. Yes we would argue out of fear! No we wouldnt think to attract a light off the knife we have. WOULD WE BE ABLE TO THINK LOGICALLY WITH SUCH FEAR IN US??? come on people. watch this movie with an open mind and just think what u would do if u REALLY WERE stuck in this situation. NONE OF US KNOW, and lets be thankful for that! as far as it being short well would we want to see 2 people floatin around in an ocean for 2 hours NO! then we would say its boring. and the end makes total sence. i wont kill it by sayin the ending."
1,horrible,This is the worst movie ever 2 and hours or whatever length the movie is of 2 people floating in water. Just horrible!!!
1,absolutly terrible,"this movie was by far the WORST movie i have ever seen.BY FAR!!!the filming was terrible....it looked like it was filmed on a really cheap video camerathe acting was so bad, you were just hoping that they got eaten by the sharksyou were honestly WISHHINGG that the movie would end. After about 30 min of the movie i was just hoping that it would end soonthe whole movie all they do is bob up and down in the water, without an attemt to savethemselvesand HTE ENDING!!! IT WAS THE WORST PART!!! you just kinda felt like ""wwwhhhaaaaa???""overall, this movie doesn't even deserve one star"
1,Wow you suck,This movie sucked Big balls. I wanted to shoot my self 2 seconds into the movie. I cant beleave that these people would ever get money to make another movie after this one
1,One star is too much for this movie,"If you want to watch two people float in the water and complain and complain and complain and complain, while sharks and jelly fish make occasional cameos, then I don't know what I could say to change your mind. This is movie is the worst movie of the year, if not of all time. I haven't been tricked into watching a movie this bad since I was convinced that Blair Witch was going to be a good movie. The only good thing I can say about this movie was that it had good cinematography. Save yourself the money and time and don't watch this movie. Even if it is free don't watch this movie."
1,Could possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen!!!,"My fiance and I wanted to see this movie in the theater, and never made it... I'm glad about that now!! We rented it and were completely disappointed. The actors were awful, there was too much ""silent"" time and there was not one entertaining moment through the entire movie. Not to mention the ending was horrible... Don't bother with this movie!!"
1,be afraid...very afraid,of anyone who actually recommends this piece of drivel .Do not on any account arange to spend a nice evng at home with this DVD unless you have backup..like another DVD - almost any other movie would do .Let me make it even clearer - if you are the type of person who likes looking at webcams of an empty ocean for 2 hrs then go ahead & buy 6 copies - you'll love it .Otherwise suck on a lemon - you'll enjoy it more.
1,Excruciating,"Possibly the slowest, most undramatic, most excruciating movie I've ever seen. Based on a true story which took place in my own country, to our shame. One of the hypothetically dramatic moments in any such tragedy would be when the dive crew, back at port, discover they've left people out on the open ocean. This film takes that moment and turns it into blah. In short: fine if you like shots of water & sky bobbing up and down, and meaningful looks. Otherwise, give it a miss - I wish I had."
1,I wouldn't watch it again if someone paid me!,"I have watched some really stupid movies but this one takes the cake. I was so excited when I saw the preview for this movie. I couldn't wait to see it. There really isn't much dialogue between the two characters until they're forgotten in the ocean. Other than a couple of brief shark scenes there wasn't any suspense. An hour into the movie my husband said ""Can you believe there is still a half an hour left."" I just kept saying ""It has to get better."" It didn't. The ending was a big disappointment. We returned the movie to the store the day after watching it for a better movie."
2,Cut to the chase!,"A young couple go to Bahamas on vacation and go with a boat on a diving expedition. Unfortuantely, the expedition leaves without the couple, and they are left alone in the open sea.Boats pass, far far away. The couple drift with the current. Different fish appear. Sharks even. Will they be found? Before they get too cold, or thirst to death, or get eaten by sharks, or...?Lots of dialogue. Not much action. Beautiful sea pictures, both over and under water. Some of this is of course good, but there is not enough here for an entire movie."
3,Fish food,"I love the widescreen edition of this movie because Blanchard Ryan's boob is stretched extra wide across the screen. This is the unnecessary highlight of the movie because after this I was drowning in bordom. That ruined my day more the getting eaten by a shark. Speaking of which, being eaten by a shark is far less painful than watching this movie.It is not as though people who see this movie do not know what happens. The moral is that since they did not have sex before going diving, they were eaten by sharks. The lesson is have sex with your partner as many times as you can in your life before you are eaten by sharks or another book is released in the Left Behind series. Speaking of which, I want the happy couple eaten by sharks to say hi to Jimmy Hoffa and Elvis for me."
1,Such a Disappointment....,"After hearing so many woderful reviews of this movie, I was truly excited to see it. I am a diver myself and the story intrigued me. The truth of the matter is that beyond the opening statement ""based on true events,"" the movie is pure fiction. All we know for sure is that these two were left behind and SOMETHING happened to them.The pure stupidity of the primary characters throughout the movie actually angered me. Why did they not try to swim toward one of the other boats (if in fact there were other boats), and why after hours in the water did they not swim toward the buoy (if in fact there was one). Do you see the problem with the movie?I had free passes to see Open Water, and I still felt like asking for a refund!"
1,I Hate you!,"For those of you that gave this movie a high rating please give me your address. I am going to sue you for pain and suffering. I can not believe you rated this so high, causing me to waste my time.I came back here to see what other people said. I have never laughed so hard in my life. This movie should be rated five stars for the funniest reviews ever.I tried to leave the rating blank but it wouldn't let me. I think if Amazon knew how crappy a movie could get, they should let you give it zero stars"
2,The sharks are the best actors,"The nighttime thunderstorm scene was suspenseful, and the ending emotionally gripping. I'll give this movie that much. A small plus for the realism, too -- no stunt doubles, and real sharks. I didn't even mind the minimalism. It's about two people stranded in the ocean and trying to survive. I didn't expect glamorous cinematography and flashy special effects.But you have to be able to generate some kind of empathy for the characters to care about their plight. And it's impossible to do that. Good actors will make you forget that they're acting. In this movie, the fact that they're acting is painfully obvious. The performances are wooden, and the dialogue is absolutely dreadful. What in the world was Lions Gate thinking when it bought this flick?"
1,Ugh.,"This movie is just bad. We turned it off half way through about the time the couple started bickering at each other while floating in the water. I'll check out ""Open Water II"" starring Bob and Eileen when it comes out."
1,What the heck is this??,We rented this video becuase I thought it was about sharks and suposse to be like Jaws well I agree with the other guy root for the sharks because this film will drag on and the end is BAD. I cant beleive they came out with this as a horor movie and it was more like Cast Away and it was based on a real life event but they have no proof that it came down like that. I would save your money and see a real show somewhere else. I cant beleive that this made it the movies. What a let down and what a JOKE!! I am totally truthful that this is one of the slowest and dryest movies ever and the end will kick you in the butt and leave you so mad that you want to kick the TV. Please dont waist your money and your time on this film.
2,slow,"Another indy film that got lots of attention, Open Water features the tale of 2 young divers who get left behind while on a diving excursion. Not much else to it; they bob in the water, argue, make-up, curse their bad luck etc etc. Sharks linger in the area but never really take center stage until the end. I admire the stripped-down style of film-making but this project is just too long without much happening. Worth watching but not nearly as good as media made out."
2,Wasnt Very Good,I really didnt like this movie because i didnt really care for seeing to people floating around in the ocean for an hour. I loved the low budget look of the movie but the story just didnt do it for me.
1,This movie sucks,"Bad movie, bad acting, bad screenplay, no suspens, no thriller, nothing, boring movie from begining to end, just to follow a sleep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.1 star just for the title.Do not waste your money :("
1,aburrida,"Aunque la premisa de encontrarse varado en el mar frente al peligro inminente de tiburones sea prometedora, lo cierto es que la pelicula decepciona a tal punto que luego de los primeros 15 minutos que uno trata de no aburrirse te das cuenta que hay mas aburrimiento por venir. Se dice que es una pelicula de terror, al nuevo estilo psicologico de peliculas como El Aro o Aguas Oscuras; sin embargo, el realizador no logra introducirnos ni contagiarnos del terror que sufren los personajes. Estamos viendo a una pareja en medio del oceano como si vieramos a una pareja perdida en la calle, discutiendo si llegaron a tiempo para tomar el último autobus. Francamente más terror psicologico he sentido al ver documentales médicos sobre cancer; y por favor dejen de compararla con Tiburon porque no hay ni una pizca para ello."
1,"What i have to give this trash one start to rate it,./sigh.","I though the movies was awfull and i wouldn't recomend it to a single friend to waste there time watching this i would say, here story goes two people got stranded in the ocean, don't go deep see diveing. See there end of story."
1,What a horrible film!,This movie is a piece of crap and not even scary at all. It's only 79 minutes long. I fell asleep during the movie it was like watching Jaws and when they were screaming I felt like I was watching another Blair Witch movie. Don't listen to the other reviewers on amazon. This movie is really awful. I can't believe I spent good money on a stupid film. It didn't even seem like a true story most of the movie was like watching a remake of Jaws or whatever. I just didn't like it much but if I were you do not see it.
2,borrow it from a friend,"I must say, they did a better job than I could have done, but for the money, I would try to borrow it from someone who has a copy, than buy it. the begining is anything but lame, trying to spruce it up with a nude scene doesnt help. there is anticipation involved in the time after being ""left behind"" but the ending leaves you with a ""that's it?"" feeling. The Shark footage is cool, but watching shark week was much more interesting. I knew it was bad when I thought I would share it with my son and daughter and there friends and all they did was mock the whole thing, and were gone after 40 minutes of the film."
4,YOU GO SCUBA DIVING & GET LEFT BEHIND ?,"First of all I wasn't excepting some Jaws flick , but over all i would love EVERYONE that didn't rate this movie to be "" DECENT and Realistic"".LET me SEE how you would be left behind and out at sea with nothing but SHARKS !!!!All around you and get back to me and let me know about this experience, I WOULD just LOVE to know really.......... OF course YOU probably wouldn't be able to cuz you all would be DEATH "" EATEN ALIVE"" !!!! SHARK BAIT!!!!"
1,Character development? What's that?,"I've subjected myself to some pretty lame movies over the years, but this one ranks in the top5 worst that I've seen. Don't waste your time!"
3,A VERY Flexible Food Chain on Display,"What would it be like to trapped in the great outdoors? This movie provides one idea. Left in the ocean due to human error, a married couple must now deal with the consequences.What the makers really did well was capturing the sense of isolation for the couple. A lot of scenes really went out of their way to show the vast expanse of the ocean, which created an effect of the couple being small and insignificant. It serves as a reminder that we might be at the top of the food chain, but that position is not fixed; all it takes is one botched headcount and you are at Mother Nature's mercy.While I classify this as a thriller, this is not a standard one; the conflict is mostly psychological, as the couple tries to keep their hopes up in face of these overwhelming set of circumstances. Filmgoers looking for something big, scary and gory should look elsewhere."
1,"Over-hyped, Poorly made attempt at a Thriller","There is a tense ten minute thriller here. Unfortunately, it is buried in a 79 minute boring piece of cheaply produced cinema. The actors are bad, the direction is far from subtle and we're forced to sit through a lot of absolutely irrelevant and useless exposition for a couple of short thrilling moments. Really over-hyped and not even worth a rental. Save your money."
3,real sharks = some real thrills,This is an interesting movie. It doesn't completely work but it's worth watching. It was shot on a very low budget with actors in the water with real sharks. The footage of real sharks and with no background music accompaniment provides a few thrills as you never know when or whether they will attack. I agree with other reviewers that there needed to be more sharks to make this movie truly great. With such a limited plot they needed to use them more. The ending was a surprise to me and I thought very well done.
4,Open Water makes you fear sharks again,"Open Water is a great movie with a great cast of two people and a bunch of sharks. Haven't these people ever seen Jaws? Don't they know not to go into the ocean? Do they not know the famous line from Quint: ""You go in the water. Shark in the water."" It is amazing how good this movie is. I wasn't in a rush to see it because I didn't think it sounded that great, but man was I wrong. You jump several times, it has a great ending that didn't wuss out Hollywood style. I highly recommend this movie. Even the special features are great and the fact that the actors did all that with real sharks is amazing and crazy. I don't know how scary it would be if we were not already preconditioned to fear sharks thanks to Jaws, but Open Water blows any recent shark movie, Deep Blue Sea for instance, out of the water."
4,You could make your own but why?,"Its cheap enough and its better. It has has a mesh filter thing on it too. If you have the can, I'd buy the spout to go with it. Everything is pressure clamped together and its a nice product. Use a 1/2"" socket wrench without a socket to remove the plug from the gas cans cap."
3,fun but wont last,"Ok so my daughter was 2 3/4 and not 3 (toy rated for age 3), but she loves Elmo and loves playing with this toy. It is somewhat loud an there is no volume control. Also after 4 months of use the pen stopped working, rendering the toy worthless. Also the binding is weak and my daughter has torn the sheets with normal use. So fun toy while it lasts."
5,Bombardiers memoir,"Myers writes his story of flying bombing missions over some of the toughest targets in German occupied Europe during 1944. When they weren't getting shot at over their targets they were chasing, and catching, the Italian signourinas. Each page demands that you continue reading to see what these young flyers do next. Odd ball characters, like Earl Ruhlin the co-pilot, keep jumping out of the story as he goes from one adventure to the next. You will laugh when you read how the navigator ends up sleeping with a 90 year old crone by mistake. Terrifying and hilarious. Dont miss ""Shot at and Missed""."
1,Sucks!,What I got was not what was pictured I'm pissed and its not worth mailing back THEY NEED TO EDIT STUFF BEEFOURE IT GHOES HOUT FER SAIL
4,Great 2nd to a Super Series,"This is the 2nd book in the ""Hank Thompson Series"", the first being ""Caught Stealing"" which I think was a 5 star review. I would recommend reading that book first before ""Six Bad Things"" in order to get the feel of the background of Hank and his problems! I will not go into the story-line, many other reviews have already done this so I will just rate the book on its elements (0 to 5 being highest):Protagonist Development: 4 (knowing things from the first book a 5)Antagonist Development: 4Minor Character Development: 4Storyline: 4Setting: 4Theme: 5Writing Style: 5Overall Rating: 4+"
4,"If It Wasn't for Bad Luck, I'd Have No Luck At All","Six Bad Thingsis a worthy sequel to the phenomenalCaught Stealing. It was another hard core ride into non stop running, hiding, terror, and the worst of luck.The antihero, Henry Thompson, has been living safely in Mexico for several years when he is discovered by the nephew of the Russian mob. What happens next? More of the same as happens inCaught Stealing, only with a whole new cast of characters.Charlie Huston has continued his wonderful trademark noir, cast with grit, dirt, swearing, and non-stop, grip you by the throat action. While not as good asCaught Stealing, it is certainly a worthy followup and a great transition into the final volume of this trilogy,A Dangerous Man.This book is a must read for Noir fans and Charlie Huston readers. While the first book could be a stand alone book, this one catapults it into a must read set of three books. You should not miss this one, if you have already.J.Stoner"
3,Lost interest half-way through,"I had to force myself to finish the first book in this series (Caught Stealing) and thought I'd give this one a try. I really enjoyed the first 100 pages, but then it just got boring, which was pretty much how I felt about the previous book. The overall tone is more serious and not as witty as the previous book, which doesn't help."
3,Yawn,I have to say- this author is prolific but I rather see effort put into quality instead of quantity.
3,Violence and F-bombs,Very well paced narrative and story telling. The violence however was over the top as well as F-bombs and drug use...for my taste. Just not my kind of thing...if it were I can see giving it 5-stars.
2,Itchy and Scratchy Violence,The second half of the book is a neverending parade of cartoon violence. The cast begins to blur and fade together as our hero suffers one beating/shooting/injury after another but keeps on going with the help of an occasional percocet instead of three weeks in the hospital. By the end I had lost track of who was doing what to whom and for what reason. Improbable coincidences pile up and let the hero's pursuers track him down against all odds. I think I read and enjoyed the author's first book but this one was like finishing a dull assignment. It was a chore to read at the end.
3,Please use real punctuation...,"I really enjoyed the author's book about the vampires. It was cool. However, this book I found the use of dashes instead of real punctuation to be distracting.I often could not figure out if the person was having a conversation or if the main character was just thinking it in his head. I found myself skimming near the end because I was bored with the main character.I enjoyed the frist book so much that I feel disloyal even writing this review - sorry Charlie."
4,Just when you think things can't get any worse...,This is a great romp. Can't wait for the next one.
5,Works better than expected,If you have stains of any kind in your dishwasher this will clean them. It is well worth the money even though you only get two uses out of a tube. Trust me you won't regret buying it.
4,IT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA DANCED TO IN THE 60'S!!,"THE MARKETTS TURNED THE VERY FAMOUS 60'S TV THEME SONG OF ""THE OUTER LIMITS"" INTO A POPULAR DANCE HIT! THE MARKETTS HAD A DISTINCTIVE SOUND THAT DISTINGUISHED THEM FROM OTHER CALIFORNIA SO-CALLED ""GARAGE BANDS"".THIS C.D. IS JUST ONE OF THE ALBUMS THAT WERE POPULAR BY THEM IN THOSE DAYS.THEY CREATED THE FAMOUS ""SURFER'S STOMP"" DANCE CRAZE.ANOTHER GREAT SONG ,NOT IN THIS C.D., IS ""BALBOA BLUE"" A BIG #1 HIT FOR THIS BAND, HERE IN CALIFORNIA.THIS C.D. IS FOR THE COMPLETE COLLECTOR. IF NOT, GO FOR THEIR GREATEST HITS!BUY IT!!RETURN TO THE DAYS OF SUN AND SURF IN CALIFORNIA.NO DRUGS JUST PURE MUSIC HIGH!"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED - NO CLOSED CAPTIONING or SUBTITLES,VERY DISAPPOINTED. The visual portion of the presentation is acceptable but the VHS Tapes do NOT PROVIDE CLOSED CAPTIONING OR SUBTITLES. If you are hearing impaired or deaf do not purchase this item.
1,"A beginners book, and not a very good one.","I bought this book because I am looking for ideas on how to put people at ease. But I was disappointed. The book starts with a once-over-lightly discussion of how to take good snapshots of friends and family members. It starts with the basics--types of cameras, film, lighting, and how to take a photo. All standard stuff that can be found in any introductory book. It then gives you lots of ideas for where and when you can take photos (At parties! weddings! when people are having fun!). Again, pretty standard stuff, and directed towards folks who only take pix of the relatives sitting on a couch. But the advice on taking a good phot was incomplete. How do you get a good shot of a person? Take the photo at the right moment. But there was no suggestion on how you do that.Here's a suggestion: People and Portrait Photograhy, Sean Hargrave, Amphoto. ... Color photos. Beautiful layout. Good sidebars. Lots of ideas."
5,Super Reference For Shy Photographers,"When you feel uneasy to take pictures of people, either family or friends, this book will give you the knowledge and attitude to do it with style and success."
2,Very Basic Portuguese Vocabulary,"A friend recommended these CDs since her class was using them. Alone, I felt that they were disappointing. They're just basic audio vocabulary: english word followed by its Portuguese equivalent. That's it. No sentences. No context. Just Words. I wanted something to help me prepare for a vacation to Brazil and should have skipped these CDs. They weren't helpful."
2,"too much raunchy sex, not enough of anything else","This was my first Judith Gould book, and I won't try her again if this is her style.The problem: The book did not deal NEAR enough with the main characters, Val and Wyn - and had way too much dirty, drug-induced sub-plot sex going on between all the other characters. Who cares?!! I do not want to read the detailed sex lives of all the villians in the book! I want to hear about the main characters. I was half-way through the book before the 'hero' and 'heroine' even kissed! But I had read at least 4 sex scenes by then. I felt like I was reading porn at some points.What I read of Val and Wyn - I liked - but there needed to be way more about them, way more love, more plot, etc. Just cut the first 150 or so pages and start where Val and Wyn first meet - then add 200 pages or so in the middle developing their characters and their love story. Then you'd have a good book.I wish I would have checked it out at the library instead of buying it . . ."
1,"Lost this book, found it recently, wish it had stayed lost","I picked this book up a while back, but lost it in a pile of boxes when I moved last year. I found it recently while I was taking a sick day from work; I wish it had stayed lost.I know that these romance thrillers tend to have rather unrealistic plots, but this novel has a plot that defies even the most flexible of minds. There is no thrill in this thriller - I just plodded through the book, hoping that something would rescue it from mediocrity, but no such luck.I was also hoping that I would care about what would happen to the characters in the story. The characters , however, have no depth whatsoever, so I did not want to cheer on any of them. A bad plot can sometimes be rescued by characters that the reader feels some connection with; in this case, bad plot and bad characters make the reading tedious.This book is better used as a doorstop."
1,don't waste your time,"I have a problem, I start a book and have to finish it. I was hoping this book would get better but it didn't. I have never read a book from this author and based on this book I wont read another written by her. Don't waste your time. I should have read the reviews before checking it out at the library like I always do but I didn't have the time, oh well."
1,Reeky Trash,"I read this book expecting an enjoyable romance between a man who feels rejected by the world and a loving veterinarian who can see beyond the surface. Instead I ended up with an endless number of idiotic plot twists, a rejected fiancee with mental issues who poisons animals for fun, random people having tons of boring sex all over the place, and maybe 40 pages of actual interactions between the hero and heroine. The secondary characters were caricatures from a bad soap opera, the dialogue was reminiscent of the cheesy Harlequin novels from the sixties, the romance between the heroine and hero would register as tepid, and I quit reading it about forty pages before it ended because it was so predictable and stupid. This was a rotten book and I question how it ever got published."
5,Sunspot Rocks,"These guys (and gal) rock! I remember back in 2000 checking out their CD release party in Madison and being blown away. Ben (guitar), Mike (bass) and Wendy (drums) are all very talented on their respective instruments, and their harmony is reminiscient of The Mama's and the Papa's (with more edge of course). If you are into indie rock then this is defintely a band for you..."
5,Peter Abeles's life story we all should read,"One of the books you find difficult to put down until you finished the entire book. A story of a small boy looking out of a window at a world of the holocaust with all its horror and who is able to escape, survive and prosper in this land despite a difficult family relationship except for his love for his brother. The story of how he became a successful business man and a loving, caring family man despite his relationship with his parents should be reading material for all young people."
4,Good printer,"It's a good printer for the price, I think. I like the design (smooth and sleek and doesn't take up too much space on my desk). It prints easily and well, and the paper hasn't jammed at all. My one complaint is how small the ink cartridges are. They run out incredibly quickly. Other than that, I'd have given it 5 stars."
2,They at Capitol did the wrong thing!,"I was happy, finding this CD in a shop in Singapoore. An I was happy, when I opened it and found the Rainbow- Label Capitol used in the late fifties and early sixties. The shock came, when I played it: instead of the full Stereo- Sound I heard a meagre Mono- CD. My English Regal LP or the American abriged reissue on a bad Vinyl pressing sounded much better. Didn't they know, that they have a Stereo Master, or were they unable to find it. The CD is now out of print and I hope, in the meantime they had enough time to find the Stereo Master for the next reissue, and I hope, it will be soon, or Mr.Ray Purslow from the Recordcenter in Birmingham UK should do it!"
3,too bad,"this book is somewhat a disappointment. the original car pictures are awesome. the cars featured are the best. the text is clear and entertaining. the problem is the publisher, for whatever reason, decided to make every car picture a 2 page display. almost every car pictured in this book is cut in half. this includes smaller pictures that could have been fit on one page. this is expected for SOME of the pictures but not every one. after browsing only a few pages it becomes really annoying. the publisher could have made the book wider, or made some of the pictures smaller, or both. this could have been one of the most beautiful car books ever. even with this problem i rate this book 4 stars and i would still recommend it to others if bought at a discount."
2,kind of flimsy,I bought this for a gift for my dad who is in the process of building a train lay out. I bought this because it looked like it had a lot of detail and when it arrived I was disappointed. It's not too sturdy and the detail on it is terrible. It looks like a square piece of plastic without any detail whatsoever. My dad is pretty clever so I'm hoping that he can add his own touches to make it look more realistic (and some glue to keep it together)!
5,Excellent book,"I have only worked through the first chapter, but find this much easier to follow than some color lectures in class. The exercises are very useful, as I am exploring areas I would not have without the book."
5,Now I know . .,"Now I understand why my paintings weren't satisfying . . I didn't have the right colors for the sky, or the trees,or the ground. This book helped me learn the myriad of blues in blue, reds in red, etc. I highly recommend thisfor any artist working with color."
3,Underwhelming,I'm very disappointed in this documentary. I was exceedingly underwhelmed by the less than stellar production quality and the film maker's reliance in only two or three interviewees. The hype surrounding this film is either manufactured or from those who have never been exposed to this type of information before.
3,Good enough,"Good deal of historical info mixed with History Channel type drama. If you're bored and want to remember some history from the place and time, watch it. Otherwise, it can be boring and misleading."
1,worst documentary ever,"I rented this movie because its title was catchy since I love history,archeology and religious prophecies, but I was so disappointed for different reasons:1-It didn't provide scientific evidence to back up any of the information it provided2-It was so narrow minded, and didn't tell the story from all perspectives.3-They had a way of lying by ommiting important information.4-The first 50+ minutes was about the story of Israel and not about the prophecies that are evident in the present times.In conclusion, this movie has nothing to do with prophecies, and should be given another title. And I'm really surprised by the number of people who wrote a good review on what I see as the worst documentary I ever watched."
5,The best explanation of Prophecies ever !,"I have read and listened to many videos on Prophecies and the latter days , This movie was so well explained and was keep to the facts through the intire thing ..No blame was put on any one or any nation in particular. Just a facual account of every ave taken up to today ... If you want to understand what is really going on and hear the facts,without fear mongering or name blaming , this is the movie to wake you up and realize whats going on in the world and how it affects you and your loved ones. The time is too short to keep our heads in the sand and think it is going to get better . This is a must see movie .. If I could give 10 stars I would.."
1,What a waste of my time!,"Anyone who considers this full of half truths video as foretelling has obviously never read the Bible in its entirety.The oldest written records pertain to the Sumerians. And in the Epic of Gilgamesh we can find the beginning of a belief in end of the world scenarios. The antichrist fulfillment happened in ancient times. Many prophecies have been written after the fact. Research the amount of contradictions contained in the Bible. Go and read The Holy Virus, written by document expert Lional Parkinson, son of one of the men who helped translate the Dead Sea Scrolls.One sided views will never decode the truth. I have seen better documentaries on tv."
1,Horrible Quality and Content,"This was a horrible documentary, shrouded in not being religious and then turning to be very in your face bible reading with out any facts. Documentaries should have facts and people who we value their theories, this had NONE. Titles of the people they interviewed were very odd and there was no one well educated in history it seemed in this movie. Do not buy this awful mess. Production quality is awful, sound is muffled in places, terrible."
1,Misleading,"Fundamentalist Christian myths wrapped in pseudo science, pseudo archaeology, pseudo history and passed off as fact. I began to detect the agenda about 10 minutes in and got no further than 15 minutes before I had to turn it off. Please!"
1,"horrible , do not watch",I only watched this movie because my uncle really wanted to watch it during the holidays and since I had amazon prime and my laptop I thought why not. Its message that cross cultural tolerance and understanding is bad and that along with basically equating the United Nations and the European Union with the coming of antichrist made me irate with indignation.
1,Religious Propaganda - A Dangerous Tool,"This movie reeks of religious propaganda. It is only a fanatical representation of a one-sided view which grossly distorts factual events. It glorifies war and greed. It blasphemies the Bible and God. It's only purpose is to make the Jewish people some sort of elitist group of people because of some ancient language and book. It disrespects other religions. I have nothing against the Jewish religion; I have a problem with intolerance of other religions. This documentary belittles peace and unity... it actually refers to peace and unity as a dangerous thing. This is a really messed up documentary with some really messed up people. None of it is truth or prophecy, all of it is ignorant - pure ignorance. Shame on the people who made this movie, shame on them! If anything will destroy the human race, the mindset and opinions in this movie surely will!"
1,for those who want to believe,"One hour and twenty minutes of religious self affirmation, pure and simple. An ""expert"" panel of true believers, skeptics need not apply."
1,"Some interesting history, but far from objective","If you are a believer in biblical prophecy, you will delight in the apparent scientific affirmation of your beliefs. If you are a skeptic with an understanding of science and logical thought, you will remain skeptical. So I'm not sure this film actually accomplishes anything. It affirms belief; it does not change belief."
1,FRONT RUNNER FOR WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR,Absolute worst movie on 2012 I could imagine. It deserved zero stars. Waste your time and money somewhere else....anything would be better than this.
1,Bad propogada,"Promoted as exploring several different end of world type prophecies. In fact, it is a promotional video for Israel, Christianity, and against globalization of any type. One example they use to validate Biblical prophecies is Mark 13: 1-2 where Christ says the temple will be destroyed and no stone will be left on another. The temple was in fact totally destroyed in 70 AD about forty years after the death of Christ. Mark the evangelist is the suspected writer of the book of Mark and it is assumed he wrote the the book of Mark around 70 AD shortly after the destruction of the Temple. You may call me skeptical but writing about a prophecy after it has occurred is not enough conformation for me."
1,Blatant Religious Dogma!,"I should have known better! This program presented absolutely nothing new and was just a rehash of what has been preached from the bible time and time again. I should have rented a ""B"" rated Sci-Fi flick, it would have been more entertaining and believeable. Just another ""end of the world"" second rate program. Mayans and Aztecs went to war with Isreal??? Really??? Really?? Lots of claims of evidence, but no substantiation."
1,Opinion portrayed as fact,"This movie was portrayed as something that it was not. This was propoganda from start to finish. The ""experts"" were nothing more than evangelicals attempting to prove that the bible is true by quoting the bible. Not one bit of critical thinking involved in this production at all."
1,Thumbs Down!! Id rather have watched an episode of Ancient Aliens!,"What a waste of time. This is my first ever movie review. This was a really bad ""documentary"". Who reviews these things? ""award winning"" whatever. I'd rather watch an episode of Ancient Aliens, better cinematograhy at least."
2,Boring,"Fell asleep watching it!Was nothing new in the film.All passages from the bible.Offered nothing new, and no real insight into the future!"
3,interesting,this was an interesting documentary with a different perspective on past and present events and how they may tie together. It was a little boring and slow at times and I wish it had more action for more visual stimulation. I fell asleep the first time I wached it.
1,Skip This One,"This movie is propaganda. Watch if you want, but this movie is suspiciously light on ""facts"". Crap, complete crap. Very dissappointed that I did't spot the signs. hehe"
3,Kind of slanted information,"This video could be interesting for somebody that has no prior information on what is predicted by some empaths or the bible, but it's basically a re-hash of information that is already generally available, in my opinion. It seems they missed an opportunity to find and divulge new and previously unavailable information. Also, step away from the fear, people. Tough times are directly ahead, true, but ultimately, our true freedom awaits us on the other side."
2,Propaganda at its finest,"Wow, this is some outstanding right-wing propaganda if I've ever seen any. I love the part where one commentator is actually critical of people who think it's OK to believe in a deity, so long as it doesn't hurt anyone. As if this is what's really harmful to humanity. And think of that word for a second, humanity; deriving from the word, humane. Hmmmmmmm, making any sense to you at all? It's men like him who help create these wars this documentary so wonderfully applauds, directly and indirectly. Like the applause of Israeli military action, but yet, no mention of their abuse of military power, foreign occupation, failed foreign policy, shall I keep going?"
5,The Final Prophecies,"This movie has made me appreciate what is in the bible even more now. I have made it a point to share this with relatives so they will to. I have heard zeitgiest plays down religion but the bible cant be explained away, this movie proves how accurate it has been in prophecies and how accurate the chosen people, the Jews, have kept it. No other dvd I have purchased has explained more about prophecies and end times than this one, it has reassured me in my belief of God and Jesus Christ."
3,"Good, but wish it had more",The video was very interesting but I was somewhat disappointed that it didn't take the time to identify the actual end of days prophecies written in the bible and relate them to the current events depicted in teh video.
1,Don't waste your time,"I saw this same stuff popularized by a man, Hal Lindsey, in the 1970's. Didn't happen then either. Biblical prophesy, just because its old doesn't mean its true."
1,Painful,"Firstly, the title is deceptive as others have mentioned. Secondly, there are too many claims made without specific references. Finally, the film does more preaching about the Bible than explaining any prophecies."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought there would be something new presented in this video.I've heard all the information covered in this video before, fromother sources."
2,"Thin on Prophecy, long on review.","The first hour of this piece comes and goes with barely any talk about prophecy at all. It's mostly a history lesson. It does talk about the prophecy concerning the return of the Jews to Israel a bit. But man, it's packed with really vague forward looking bits. The voice over sounds like a guy who is trying to sell car wax. Nice cover on the front, but not much under the hood."
1,Propoganda,"This is a very poor one dimensional documentary that starts as a puff piece on the State of Israel and then continues into Christian Zionist beliefs.At one point they claim the ancient city of Petra was built by a Jewish King as a refuge for Jewish people at the ""end of days"" - utter nonsense as anyone can verify! I have been there - it is a Nebutean City.Amazon - I would like my money back!"
1,"Boring, banal and speculative.","This was the most banal 'prophecy' film I've ever seen. Where are the prophecies? I can prophecy better myself! Most of the film goes over some common Jewish history that about anyone knows. The film incorrectly states that 'Jews' are the most ancient people. Wrong! 'Jews' didn't exist until after Judah begat his offspring. Sumerians existed thousands of years prior to the House of Judah and Israel. Abraham left Ur due to God telling him to get moving (due to the coming collapse of the ancient Sumerian/Akkadian civilization), etc. It mentions the book of Daniel but fails to point out even one alleged future prophecy and so on. They threw in a bit of the book of Revelation here and there and voila...boring junk that you could probably get for free off of any history channel or televangelist channel. You get the picture. Yawn!!! For the love of God, I hope the title is correct and this film is ""FINAL""...Please...for the love of God, do not make a sequel."
1,"If you want to hear a handful of men ratifying conservative Christian/Jewish perspectives such as the End of Days, this is for y","If you want to hear a handful of men ratifying the conservative Christian/Jewish perspectives on the End of Days, this is for you. Otherwise, skip this one."
2,Entertaining Drool for the Weak Minded,"It's easy to see why this so called documentary was put together by producers with a clear agenda and very little knowledge of history or archeology.As a second temple history buff and someone who loves to learn about ancient history it is clear that the participants and ""educators"" will take a mythical story and turn it into a ""miracle."" Anyone who brings a critical eye to history is called a ""rationalist"" and put in a category with the uneducated. While some parts of this film are historically correct in regards to Israel, there are huge assumptions made about the evils of international peace and interfaith tolerance. This movie wants you to believe that just because some of the old testament is true then everything in the entire cannon is fact as well. I would recommend these talking heads attend some university level courses in Bible History and Bible Archeology. Do not waste your time on poor research and weak logic."
5,Does the job well,I like the product. IT does the job well in making sure photo does not bend. Priority Mail envelope is rigid but not enough for CD or DVD. I use this to make sure it stays flat and hard to bend.
5,Great!,Envelopes came exactly as described and work great! FANTASTIC VALUE! I have not found envelopes of this quality for this price anywhere else.
5,Best Mailer For The Price,"I spent a good deal of time looking for a good mailer for sending out 8x10's. I needed them to minimize both the possibility of damage, and the cost of that protection. This mailer fit the bill nicely. It protects from the normal hazards of shipping. It does not protect from liquid hazards. If that is required I would suggest you still use this mailer but put the image (or document) being mailed in a plastic bag inside the mailer...I recently sent out about fifty photos from a shoot. None of the recipients notified me of a complaint so I would assume they all go there in good condition."
3,Better than a regular envelope,"I ordered these to send out certificates that I wanted to protect from bending in the mail. They are much better than a regular envelop, but you do get what you pay for. They aren't as protective as the more expensive brand name ones, but they are much, much cheaper. If I had an unlimited budget I would have popped for the more expensive stronger ones, but considering the $ I had to work with, these get the job done."
4,Page Turner -- Action Adventure,"This is a straight forward action adventure book. It really moves and keeps you reading from one difficulty to the next.The main character may not be someone you would identify with but is interesting enough to follow through the book.There are lots of minor characters that move in and out of the plot, you don't see them for very long but they are believably written."
3,Good replacement,"I ordered this stone after we accidentally dropped and broke our Pampered Chef stone. Honestly, I like the Pampered Chef one a bit better, but this is a good replacement. The metal handle that this comes with is more shallow than I like, so we tossed it and kept the old one. The pizza cutter is a bit flimsy. But the stone itself--no complaints!"
3,"Good, but not great..","I guess I was spoiled in having one of the original baking stones made in the midwest someplace and made in the 80's... the new one does not look nearly as well made, time will tell..."
5,Bach 2G bass trombone moughpiece,"I have been using a Rath B1 1/4W and like it very much but it produces a darker sound (very nice for symphony work) but I wanted something that would take a little less air but still produce a solid sound. The 2G has surprised me in that it definitely takes less air, but produces a nice cutting ""George Roberts"" sound. Now if I could just manage to master his technique................2olbones"
2,Do Gourmets Really Feeze their Meals?,"These aren't foods that the average ""gotta feed the kids quick"" person is going to be interested in. The recipes are complex and have many specific ingredients (such as ""Rind of 1 lemon, all white pith removed"" ) This might be appropriate for a gourmet who wants to cook fancy meals ahead, but for me, trying to feed my family of picky kids, it didn't offer anything."
4,Bounty paper towels,Bounty is always a favorite paper towel with our family although I wish that Amazon would list the select-a-size version as we find it helps minimize waste by allowing you to simply take less paper.
5,"The first book held my Interest totally, excellent.","This book is a total awakenig for me, because it explained so many things about mind power abilities. This book will allow you to live on Earth some what happy. I realy enjoy Uri's positive power as well as his insights into the psychic world. My work relations have been improved greatly due to my attitude after reading this terrific book."
1,BLAH,BLAH..............WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.FULL OF HOW TO CORRECT YOUR BAD HABITS BYBRAIN WASHING YOURSELF. DOUBLE BLAH !
1,My contacts at the CIA inform me that Uri 'works' there ....BUT,"Here is the sad sick truth on this 'man' - if you can even call him a man - he is known as the 'spoonman' (the Soundgarden song is about both him and the grays - who put scoop marks in every body's knees for genetic testing)This guy is one of the FALSE PROPHETS of the Book of Revelations - working 'signs and wonders' (pathetic as they are yes!)Just as bad is that he is a disgustingly perverse HOMOSEXUAL and a member of these 'elite' sex cult societies - the 'illuminati'.He and his gay lover Zaza (aka Dr. Lisle -also a CIA employee - both are Nephillim snake'men'). They reside at the Matterhorn.The story ""The Grinch who stole Xmas"" is about these two. Uri is the dog/deer; Zaza is the Grinch.God will soon destroy both of them - and good riddance to them both!"
5,Great Guide!,"While estate and yard / garage shopping , this is a quick guide to artists and their works! Easy to follow by alphabetical order."
4,A nice movie companion,"This book is full of great pictures, and that's the obvious reason to buy it. For the fan of the movie, this is a must-have. For a fan of Tolkien in general, this is a must-have. Our house has two whole shelves dedicate to books by, about, or inspired by, Tolkien.Purists will note that where the movie departs from the book, this visual guide follows the movie (ie the visual guide furthers the myth that Saruman creates the Uruk-hai, names Arwen's jewel the Evenstar instead of Arwen herself, etc). Purists will also note that there appears to be a great deal of dialogue here that was cut from the theatre release (including Boromir's Dream & Galadriel's presenting of the gifts)--one can only hope they will be reinserted for the Director's Cut version on a DVD!The book is divided into sections: History, The Free Peoples of Middle-Earth (Hobbits, Men, Elves, Dwarves) The Istari, and The Dark Powers. All in all, a wonderful visual companion for a visually stunning movie!"
4,A Good Coffee Table Book,"A good coffee table book with photos from the ""Fellowship of the Rings"" movie. It would make a great present of a Lord of the Rings fan. Along with the pictures, the book has back ground information on Middle Earth and the characters involved in this epic drama. I found the short summaries of the characters and places to be quite interesting. Having a set a pictures from the movie adds a new dimension to the book.Of course, a coffee table book with pictures is not a substitute for the real thing...it is a pleasant diversion with interesting pictures of hobbits, wizards and Middle Earth scenery (now that we know Middle Earth is located in New Zealand <g>)."
5,A great book to cuddle up with,"This book was literally my companion while I waited for the DVD to be available for purchase, allowing me to get my ""LOTR fix"" whenever I needed it. The pictures are wonderful, as are the descriptions of the characters.There were several references and pictures to scenes that weren't in the theatrical version (but were in the extended version). This may have been confusing or irritating to some, but I found it exciting as it gave a hint of what I had to look forward to in the extended version.I prefer it to the ""making of...."" books, because it portrays the characters instead of the actors. You can really become immersed in the story, and in Middle Earth, by cuddling up with this book."
2,don't buy it!,"Based on the rave reviews I purchased this book. I am minoring in Italian and wanted a grammar that went into more detail than the very good, but basic one I own (Essential Italian Grammar Olga Ragusa). I have to agree with the other reviewer here who stated that this is not an easily accessible book. Like the other reviewer I too am near fluent in two other languages and already have a background in Italian. The book is not well organized, and though loaded with examples, few were of the kind that proved helpful in shedding light on the language in a way that improved my understanding of the nuances of usage. It is so poorly put together that I too am planning to toss it in the Goodwill bag, and look for another grammar book."
2,Esoterica of Grammar,"This is not an ""advanced"" grammar--it goes several steps beyond. It is so esoteric that I shall never need to use it to learn to speak Italian. Sometimes I have to go to the dictionary to learn the English words they use."
1,Be Forewarned,This door does not lock to your existing sliding glass door and it does not have a slider to block small animals from getting in or for when you want your dog to be temporarily locked out. Also much cold air seeps through the single pane glass.
3,For a Strong Cat or Dog,"The door panel is easy to install in a standard size slider. On the Plus side: The panel is sturdy, the clear glass lets in light and a view, and it comes with a locking mechanism.On the cautionary side: The door flap is solid rather than clear which may make your pet hesitate to use it, and the flap magnet is quite strong, which may be good if you live in a windy area, but a cat or small dog has to ""hit it pretty hard"" to push through it, also potentially causing your pet to not want to use it willingly."
5,Stravinsky rocks!,"... and so does this arrangement for 2 guitars, bass and drums. This recording has more energy than many orchestral renditions of the piece, and is very well executed. The bonus disc with hip-hop rhytms and rap was actually fun in many places.Definitely well worth checking out for Rite buffs without preconceptions!"
2,what a disappointment,"how do you take one of the most intense and aggressive pieces of music written in the past 100 years and turn it into something this dull and boring - i guess it would take 2 years of preparation to suck the fire out of it - and disc 2, the electronic reworking? forget it - muzak has more movement and energy than this - lame - stravinsky laughs at you all"
2,good book,"The book is ok. But, rather than purchase it, you are better off going to a local public library and just looking at it there. The information within the book is informative, but along the lines of ""tourist book."" There is a good amount of information in the book, however, the history of milling in North Carolina is ""SKIMMED"" over and only talks about a handful of mills here and there. The area of milling in North Carolina has not been one with a large number of people concentrating their research interests, let alone efforts. Much more is given to historical preservation in North Carolina."
1,Labels that don't stay stuck.,"I was doing some shopping for labels, and I came across these. Impressed by the quantity/price ratio, I pulled the trigger. Labelled some boxes. Within 20 minutes the labels were peeling at the edges. Labelled some Rubbermaid totes. Labels didn't even stick. Then I stuck one on a piece of printer paper, figuring anything adhesive sticks to printer paper. Within an hour, the label was peeling up at the edges.Managed to set up a return/refund on the last day it was available, thankfully.Perhaps these stick to old school floppy disks just fine, but for around the house or shipping use, these are 100% fail."
1,Misadvertisement - Wrong version shipped,"The title here saids ""Thomas' Calculus Early Transcendentals (11th Edition) (Thomas Series)"" which is what I wanted but when I received, it is the 10th Edition NOT the 11th Edition."
1,Horrible Book,"I am new to Calculus and I find this book to be extremly difficult to understand. When given pratice problems, there is no material in the book that will at least provide you with an example of how to do the problems. There are examples shown how to solve a problem, however most of the pratice problems do not have an example. I find that learning from this book is a extremly difficult task."
3,Avoid This Book,"My title for this review is a bit harsh, but I make it because of how much I like the earlier texts by Thomas. If you are taking Calculus, go to the library and look up one of his texts from the 60s or 70s. These books will not treat you like you are the dumbest person on the planet and force feed you hundreds of pages of blah blah, rather they treat you to a feeling for how to think through Calculus. Although there are proofs in these books, they are not that hard to understand and they will help shed some light on the subject at hand."
3,Poorly Organized,"This book does a decent job with defining theories and concepts, which anyone can do; however, when trying to provide or explain examples and solutions to problems it leaves you very short of how it is done. The solutions manual is highly recommended for this book (ISBN 0-201-66211-6). Throughout the semester my professor used selected problems throughout the chapters to practice on but lectured and provided examples from his own problems. Without a lecture, this book is very hard to work with."
1,Horrible book not enough examples,"If you buy the book alone without the solutions manuals and you are taking calculus 1 2 or 3 you will have the hardest time in your life.Its ridicoulus how the examples in the book are general and when the problems arrive in the section they are mostly special cases where you have do to something absolutly different. For a student this book is a nightmare, maybe for somebody that has taken the class before or knowledgeble this book might be useful to practice hard problems. In my opinion, books like these should not be published for the purposes of teaching their content in universities."
3,70's Organ funk,"I had this cd on vinyl back when it came out in the 70's, along with ON THE AVENUE & TWO-HEADED FREAP. This was back when the Hammond organ was being receded more & more into the backgrond , being replaced more & more with Rhodes, wurlitzer & synths, until the mighty Hammond gained it's resurgence towards the end of the 90's & beyond. Does this cd hold up ? Well, probably not as well as the other 2 cd reissues i just mentioned. If you're expecting the heavy, over-driven grungy sound of the Hammond/Leslie sound here, you'll be disappointed ; Foster does play well , but the sound is rather sterile & very dated . the arrangements are middle of the road, the song selection is un-inspired, & the recording is very sterile , considering that is a decade before the Digital age came along. Foster has done way better work than this. I hope they re-release ON THE AVENUE, & maybe TWO-HEADED FREAP."
2,What a disappointment!,"I see by reading the other reviews that I appear to be the only person who did not enjoy this book. I thought it was a complete waste of time.I didn't care for the hero, Falcon, at all. In fact, at times, he acted like kind of jerk. All he cared about was money and land. He was willing to throw Mariah away and marry a woman he didn't like just for money. Not the kind of hero I'd want.The plot got better toward the end, and just when I thought this book may redeem itself, Ms. Mason just left the most important issue unresolved! Can Falcon NEVER claim his son as his own? It just seems like she got tired of writing and just decided to wrap it up early. Everything is a mess, then within a few pages - presto, a quick solution to end the book.Maybe it's just me - I'm a Karen Marie Moning fan and her heroes are larger than life and devoted to the heroines. I bought 3 Connie Mason books, and all 3 were disappointing, this one being the worst. Sorry CM fans!"
3,A Knight's Honor by Connie Mason,"I love stories full of romance and chivery, but I found this book somewhat lacking. It is a nice enough story, but the characters were not developed enought for me to care about their outcome. A lot of sex and too little development of the people in the story.It was a nice was to pass the time, but wil not live on my bookshelve."
2,"Not a very good plot, boring characters","I liked the first couple chapters in the books, but it went downhill from there. The hero and heroine didn't know each other very well, and didn't seem to even like each other very much when they were not in bed. Even then the love scenes were all the same, and not that interesting (the same words seemed to be used for each one). Many times in the book I wondered why the hero was even IN the book. The heroine saved herself more than once, and the people of her village and castle were more help than the hero - he was sort of useless, a bit dense, and not even very nice. Overall, this was not a bad book, but it was very far from good. I'm soooo glad I got it while it was free. I would have been very disappointed, had I paid for it."
2,A One Dimensional Read,"Thank heaven I didn't pay any money for this book as I would have been very disappointed in myself.The characters are very one dimensional, the history is merely there as window dressing with little regard for accuracy and the sex scenes are, quite frankly, dull. Find another way with a better book to pass the time."
1,Grr,I have been waiting for this book for 7 business days and 6 week days and it has not came in. I am very angry and I am never ordering from this stupid bookstore again
1,Think twice about replacement... done with APC,"This is the third strike for APC in my book. Their equipment has now failed me three times. Three different models over the years have worked fine until the batteries were expended, then I buy replacements and the unit is trashed. With the higher end XS900 I assumed it would be fine with the replacements, but the charging circuit is not working. Batteries have been test and they are fine so I'm assuming APC designs products that won't survive the death of the first set of batteries. So these two new batteries go in the pile of perfectly functional batteries that have nothing to go in.I've learned my lesson and will try another brand of UPS. This product (the battery) works fine for me, but I'm scoring low to warn folks to think twice about flushing money down the toilet if they aren't sure that the unit will work with new batteries. I'm off the cycle of replacing the hardware and strongly recommend you skip the replacements and go buy another brand."
1,Doesn't hold charge,"Did not work right, held charge for 2 days. Junk. I would have expected a little more from it. Would not recommend, would give no stars if I could."
1,Stopped holding charge after 3 months,"I ordered this to replace the battery in my APC Back-UPS ES 500. Unfortunately, this item stopped holding a charge after 3 months, even though the expected battery life is 3 to 5 years. Also, Amazon cannot accept returns on such ""hazardous"" items as these, so it looks like I am plumb out of luck."
5,Right on the money,"Fine vendor, service, delivery.Would have been just a bit better had they put in some basic recycling instructions for the old (no return service was purchased) but that is just pure opinion."
1,Not happy,"I ordered this battery believing it would be cheaper than buying a whole new UPS. If it had worked correctly it would have been but it is DOA out of the box. I replaced the old battery with this one, let it charge overnight and now when turning the UPS on, it still says replace battery. And I can't return it due to the return policy which is BS...you can ship the device but you can't take a return."
1,Misrepresenting Item Picture,"The picture shows an authentic APC battery. What was received was a BTI battery.Coincidently, the APC UPS failed 2 weeks after this battery was used.Note: I have used BTI batteries before, without this result. Otherwise, I would not have used this battery.I would like to see a picture of what will be received when choosing my seller.Note: Note: this is not my first feedback on this purchase or to the seller."
2,Only 6 months then kaput,"I've had a few of this replacement battery over the years with them lasting at least 2 years, but the most recent one I purchased thru Amazon in November no longer holds an adequate charge. APC rates the battery of having a life of 2-3 years, this one barely lasted 6 months. From my experience and other reviews on this model, APC may be having quality control issues."
1,"not a ""green"" option after all","I purchased this ""name brand"" battery rather than a generic equivalent because I was led to beleive that return postage was prepaid to recycle the old battery. When I received my battery, there was no prepaid sticker for the shipping box, but rather there was mention of a website for further instructions. The website had a message indicating that they no longer handle these types of batteries, but to return the battery to a local recycling center for automotive batteries. Before I spend another 5 bucks in gas to drive this battery somewhere, I think this bad boy will be hitting the trash can. I own several more APC UPS's, but the next time I need a battery replacement, I'll go with a much cheaper alternative than APC. (bait and switch??)"
1,Wrong battery,Can I return this order ?? Can I return this order? Can I return this order? Can I return this order?
4,"No problems so far, a tad pricey","This battery is a bit high priced compared to competitors, but I needed it shipped same day, so I bought from amazon. Working fine."
1,Reconditioned Battery,"Upon inspection of this battery out of the box, it was obvious that it is a reconditioned battery. There are many scuff marks on the sides and especially the bottom. The plastic feet on the bottom are worn. There is no date of manufacture. I set the old five-year-old battery from my UPS beside the one that I received from Amazon today and the casing of the old battery is in better condition than the ""new"" one. If Amazon sells a product, I assume that it is new unless stated otherwise. Considering the cost of returning this item, I am stuck with a less-than-acceptable product. If you decide to buy this item from Amazon, you should inspect it carefully when you first receive it. And let Amazon know that you are not happy if you receive a product that does not meet their standards."
4,No complaints,"I bought two of these to replace aging battery cartridges that were no longer holding a charge. Each original was over 3 years old. The nice thing about this unit is that it comes with a prepaid return label so that the old cartridge can be recycled at no cost to the buyer.However, if you'd like to save some money, you can consider generic units. I found that the ""Batteries Plus"" chain stores will also accept spent batteries (and entire UPS systems) for recycling at no charge."
3,Battery,"APC RBC2 Replacement Battery , I actually received a knockoff of this battery. That was not what I thought I was purchasing. This is not a company that I would do business with anytime again."
1,DOA in the Box,"The Seller sent me a dead battery. I tried it in several of my APC units and it just does nto workWhy does Amazon allow this Seller to continue to sell on AmazaonSure it looks like an APC battery but it is dead. Oh and before you ask, yes, I tried for weeks to charge this so called new battery."
3,Not APC branded,"The picture and description clearly say APC branded. What arrives is not APC branded. I'll have to see how long it lasts, but my experience with non-APC brands is not good."
4,works great!,"I got this battery to go into my 10-year-old CS500, aka BK500. The old battery, though it could light a test light, made the red ""replace battery"" light come on whenever I turned the unit on. This happened after an outage where I just ran the pack dry.This new one went right in, and no more light. I use this lower-wattage APC UPS for my DVR, as it can't supply my high-end gaming computer (I have an APC XS1500 for that)."
4,Works just as good as new,Works as well as you can expect a replacement battery to work. My UPS doesn't beep and chirp like it used to when I had the old battery in there. Last one was good for 4 years.
2,Must really need to be a local,"I work in the oil gas industry and saw this book advertised on a billboard in Lafayette, LA so I bought it. I am a regualar in Southern Louisiana and figured I would enjoy.Only read the first 25 pages and found at least three words on each page that I had to look up in the dictionary. I am a college educated person and an avid reader so I decided to put the book down."
4,Great Gift!,Bought this for a friend that is big Nebraksa fan. It went over great and it is a nice quality product.
1,Don't buy this book,This book was a gift to me by one of my colleagues. Doesn't really tell you much on retinal detachments. This is the type of book that was written just for the sake of writing a book. Complete waste of money if you'll buy it. The authors are not even experts in their field.
4,Interesting & Fun,A different kind of art object that draws attention. Every time you look at it you see something you didn't notice before.
3,Subdued Bias,"Bederman chronicles the lives and movements of four prominent figures in the 1880-1917 period: Theodore Roosevelt, G. Stanley Hall, Ida B. Wells, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman. However this work seems more of a history of feminism than a cultural history as Bederman focuses mainly on the achievements of women, the attempts women made for suffrage and better working conditions, all the while trying to explain away the positions of the male counterparts as lacking, unfairly oppressive, or some other pejorative term. Bederman's portrayals are quite thorough and academic yet they are not without bias, even though the bias may be subdued in some places."
1,And the cliches just keep on coming....,"I had to buy this book for a college course that I was taking. I suspect that the only people buying this book are those who must do so in order to pass a college course. This book is trite, cliche-ridden and not at all objective. Bederman is to the far left of the political spectrum and her politics are found all throughout this book. I've learned virtually nothing new from reading the cliches that Bederman merely repeats in this book. Bederman wouldn't know an original idea if one fell on her."
1,Sue the author and the school who hires her,"Bederman's book is anti-male hatemongering libel. If it is taught in a university then the professor/school requiring the text opens herself/itself up to the charge of creating a hostile environment for heterosexual male students, and thereby constitutes discrimination against heterosexual males based on gender. In short, the presence of her work in any school receiving federal funding constitutes hostile environment sexual harassment. As for her teaching at Notre Dame University, merely having her on the faculty would be grounds for filing a hostile environment sexual harassment complaint with the Office of Civil Rights of the Dept. of Education."
5,Wonderful tunes,"This was my introduction to Thornetta, I am still listen after having this and one other of her albums. I enjoy what I hear but need more time to really give you a great thought about review, It's a 5 no doubt"
4,great system for great price,"I first bought whatever they had at toysrus for $149.99 with 900mHz. The reception was terrible, whether from interference from other electronics or what I have no idea.I bought this one to try, and it's great. The picture is clear.My daughter is 13 months, and I wish I'd bought it 12 months ago. the only negatives are that the camera is top heavy and really needs to be screwed in - we manage by packing stuffed animals around it on a shelf. The ""night vision"" is not much - at night with lights out I can't see much, though to be truthful I never read the directions, so maybe I am missing something. Also the sound monitoring isn't as good as our fisher price sound monitor, so often we'll leave the sound monitor on, and just turn the video on intermittently to see what she is up to."
2,Really a cheap piece of junk,"I bought this for my 2 girls to use more or less as a toy so that they could playact with it. The product is really cheap and barely works with some effort. They used it for a little while, but quit using it because it was so ""finicky"" to use. You absolutely could not use this in a real situation. I would not recommend this product. FYI, I bought 2 of them, and they are both the same lack of quality."
2,Why?,"And the reason someone would pay $50+ for these, as opposed to $20-30 for the original All-Stars these blatantly try to rip off, would be?"
2,Not sure I trust Consumer Reports,"This was the top rated system by Consumer Reports. I returned it. The sound quality of the message I recorded as a greeting sounded awful as did the sound of the messages I received. Tried to record my greeting a number of ways, but they all sounded awful."
1,Don't dial fast or you dial over,"Everything is fine except if you dial by pushing the buttons too fast it doesn't take them at all, doesn't make the connection, and you have to hang up and start over. Don't buy this phone if you are ever in a hurry."
3,AT&T E2126 Cordless Phone,"This phone has one of the highest ratings from Consumer Reports for a single-phone with an answering system. Everything is as advertised. I have issues with three things: The screen on the handset isn't back-lit and it is difficult to read for Caller-ID and from the phone book; there is not a way to turn the ringer off completely; and adding listings to the phone book is difficult because instead of being able to move the cursor to the beginning of a phone number to add a ""1"" you must erase backwards and reenter the phone number. Sounds like I do have issues with the phone, but despite these things, it is a very reliable and easy-to-use phone."
1,AT&T E2126 Cordless,This phone was unable to complete half of its originated calls. The phone was returned for refund
2,Get a new book,Most of the parts in this book are now obsolete. Go to TIs website and get the new book.
4,Not just for laundry,Bounce Fabric Softener Sheets are great and they are not just for laundry. You can use them in your gym bag or dresser drawers. I place a few in the bottom of hampers and trash bins before I put the bag in. The smell isn't strong but it does last and the sheets are just convenient.I was finding that all the used sheets were getting in the way and I was feeling bad about just throwing them in the bin so I started to use them as little fire starters for the BBQ and fireplace.Amazon does a pretty good job of packing these things up but as soon as you open the box you may be a little overwhelmed with the smell but that dissipates pretty quick. I would recommend placing one of the boxes in an airtight bag or container. Its not like the smell is just going to go away but it will help things out a bit. Now I go a little crazy with the little sheets so 240 count you get maybe a bit much for you but trust me its well worth it.
4,I don't use 'em for fabric softening (usually)...,I use bounce sheets for static control. There's something about them that helps reduce static on all sorts of things. Particularly when you store powdered or finely ground stuff in plastic containers. Static makes particles cling to plastic. Very annoying. Rubbing the plastic with a bounce cloth helps a lot.I also tried using these on chairs made from abs plastic to see if dog hair would quit clinging to them. It doesn't seem to be working.
5,AMAZING,Bounce Dryer Sheets are the best dryer sheets. The smell alone makes our home smell amazing! I would definitely recommend these over any other dryer sheet!
4,Good,"This is first time I use a softener sheet. Comparing to not using softener, the clothes do feel a little softer after drying, but I could not tell much difference. I think I need to use it for enough times to tell its exact impact on clothes."
1,Complete rip-off,"These tools include two syringes, a set of measuring spoons, and a couple perforated spoons. I guess if you need syringes with Adria's name on them, it is worth it but otherwise, it is vastly vastly overpriced."
1,Disney Popcorn Popper,I bought this popcorn popper for my nephew. He really wanted it and couldn't wait to get it. What a disappointment! This takes a very long time to warm up and then when it does warm up it doesn't work so well. It took quite a bit of time to finish making the popcorn and then there were alot of kernels left un-popped! I would suggest that you don't waste your money on this!
2,Cute but doesn't last long,"I bought this 1 1/2 to 2 years ago as an impulse purchase. It is just too cute. A few months later it quit popping every kernel and now it only popped 20 kernels out of 1/3 cup. So I just went out and bought the Presto Microwave Popper which popped every kernel and fast.Something I didn't like from the start is that you have to tip it over but there are openings in the lid, so hot steam/water and oil drip out. So you can't really use the lid as a bowl for that reason.I am surprised the popper quit working this soon."
1,Blank doormat!,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. The doormat was blank! Had been anticipating the ""Go Away"" doormat, but received blank doormat. Will use it at the back door. Too bad!"
3,Too Small,"It is very thick which it nice...just check the size. its about 2/3 the with of a doorway.We tried to replace our current doormat, but it dwarfed this thing when it came in the mail. I couldn't live with such a small mat so I just put it on top of it. Looks ok I guess."
1,Doesn't last,Got this for the back door and the lettering wore away within months. Will never get this mat again. Get the other style which is still looking good.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"The mat is very nice but has it's flaws. The first thing is the words. Within days of using the mat on our front porch the words are practically worn off and you can barely read them. Secondly, it sheds a bit so there are long fibers strewn about the porch. Nothing that a broom can't handle tho. Other than that, it works as intended.... keeping feet clean for entry. All in all it is decent for the price.Two stars. -1 star for excessive shedding and -2 stars for words disappearing after a few days of use."
1,Blank mat received,"Apparently there's very little quality control for this product. Which you would think ""Look at mat: Make sure its not BLANK"" would be the easiest of quality checks for a product in existence. I too, received a blank mat.That said its a decent quality mat, but I didn't order an overpriced blank mat, I ordered one with words on it. Buyers beware on this product, just because it has the ""Go away"" tag on it, doesn't mean you're getting what you order."
5,Well Made and Sturdy!,"We have one of these mats in our home, given to us years ago. Several friends admire it when they visit. Now that these friends have purchased homes, they get them too!"
1,Go Away Door Mat 1601,"Thought I was getting a regular type of rug with this painted on from Kitchen Kapers. Instead I received some sort of shedding, messy hard material straw type kind of rug. Needless to say was very disappointed! Would not recommend buying!"
2,Go Away Faded Away,After about a year the lettering on the mat faded completely away and also started to shed terribly.It was exposed to the Sun only in the early morning and had minimal foot traffic.
4,Budding Chef Enjoys These,My little guy loves to cook with me and loves even more using his own tools. These are great for him.
3,Toys are great - Bag is a bust!,"This little set is so cute and my daughter loves it! The cooking utensils are well made and just the right size for little kids. However, the bag that holds them is a piece of junk. Both of the handles on ours ripped off fairly quickly so now it is just a bag with a zipper and no handles - it still works but it is too bad that the bag couldn't be as sturdy as the utensils. I still would recommend it for the toys but would find another container to put them in."
1,Very disappointed,The product was very cheaply made. I expected quality utensils reduced to a child size. I could have created what they did at the 99 cent store for about $8.00. So disappointed I did not give it to my great-grandson for Christmas. I am going to ask my daughter to return it for me when she come here again. II do not drive and can't get out to the postoffice.
2,Over priced,"I've found a number of 4 port minis that are just as good if not better for less. There isn't anything wrong with this one, it just that it costs more for less."
4,Holds up in the cold,"We've been using this for about 3 months so far. At the present time there is no storm door over the lock, so its not protected from the elements. It been exposed to at least -20F, snow and winds here in MN, and we've had no issues with its operation.The installation could have gone better. I think the instructions were more complicated than it had to be. The other issue I had was the precut holes in the door frame wouldn't accommodate the large bolt. There was nothing in the directions to even suggest how to overcome this.Also, as I've become more conscious of where stuff I buy comes from, I checked the box, this is made in Mexico."
4,Great lock - ease of installation needs improvement,"This is the 2nd Schlage BE365 keypad deadbolt I have purchased. The first was 3 years ago. I have had one problem in the 3 years of service - requiring that the lock be disassembled and reassembled. Problem went away. Never had to use the key backup. The installation instructions and process for these locks could be easier. Having multiple codes is beneficial as I use one code for me, one for the wife who wants here own code and one for another person who accesses the barn. This lock is for the house so I expect similar utility and service from this lock as the last one. Only reason I bought it was the performance of the first lock."
5,Can't live without this!,"A few years ago I installed one of these deadbolts at my lake house and loved it. Now I have one at my cabin and it looks great and has that rustic look. You cant find this color at any store either. It is so nice not to have to worry about keys and know that workmen can come in on their code, do their work then I can delete it and not worry about anyone who is dishonest making a duplicate key for later. I'll never get locked out again!"
5,Took longer to open the box than to install!,"I am all thumbs in the locksmith department. This thing was a breeze to install ONCE YOU GO ON THE WEBSITE and watch the video. The instructions are not that helpful. The video IS. But nowhere do they tell you how to get the darned thing out of the packaging. There is an internal screw that is holding it together AND a plastic pin contraption that must be defeated (not hard but GAH!) I had to hack the thing out of the styrofoam casing to discover how it was being held together. Time getting it out of the box? 20 minutes, make it half an hour what with calling the HELP line (closed on Sunday) and consulting the website (no help there). Installation? 15 minutes. Programming it is dead simple: the instructions ARE very helpful there. Great product. I will buy from Schlage exclusively based on my past experiences in changing doorknobbery and deadboltage. :)"
5,Works Great. Fast In And Even Faster Out,The lock will require a 4 digit code in order to be able to unlock the door. Otherwise the lock just spins free doing nothing from the outside. The inside works light any other door requiring you to just turn to the right to lock the door. The feature I really like is just pressing the top button when I leave and locking the door. No code required. And in a few seconds it disengages and your house is secure. Very Nice Lock and great solid built design.
2,Works great until you actually need it,"I installed 2 of these back in January 2012 and they worked flawlessly. Today the prego wife managed to lock herself out of the house. I told her to go around to the side of the house and she could get in with the keypad, only the code wouldn't take. I thought maybe there was something wrong with the unit on the side of the house. When she was finally able to get in, she tried the one in the garage. Nope that one failed too. So I am 0-2 now. I was also an early adopter of Schlage's Securkey locks. Those things are junk as well as I was continously re-keying locks throughout the house. It wasn't a nuisance when I was home, but I'm currently away for the next month. My first project when I return, will be to remove all Schlage products from my house. Absolute junk."
1,Dog Gone it Crap INFERIOR,"Installed for two weeks and getting ready for the big event and DEAD!!! NADA no lights nuthing, battery good. How can this be? with as simple of technology involved and lasts two weeks.....so, here I go, replacing exchanging and all that rig a moe role..."
2,not helpful when your trailermate yells his code out,"Greetings fellow amazonians I purchased this because trailer is being broken into almost on a daily basis and I needed it to stop. So I felt more secure with a keyless entry system that would keep my trailermate mongo from losing his keys. Installation and setup was a breeze, but when I gave him the code he started walking around telling everyone it! I get up in the morning and I can hear him outside ""6457 yep that's my code!"". So now all my neighbors know his code. I have even tried changing the code to no avail because the next day ""2583 yep that's my code!"". So im going back to a keyed set and I may just not give a new key to mongo!"
4,Works well but came scratched....,"The price is good on this product and it works but I have to say that when you spend this kind of money on anything - it should arrive in new condition. It was not in the original packaging, had a few minor scratches and it didn't have instructions. I easily found what I needed on the Internet and it installed and worked well.If you get a new one, this works just as advertised. If you get a semi-new one like I did, it still works as advertised but you might feel a little cheated."
5,"Super simple, easy to use and install","This product is definitely Good Enough if all you need is a simple keyless deadbolt. I was looking between this and other too-cute Samsung RF-id units, but you can't go wrong if all you need a simple combination deadbolt and still want to have a key in case the battery dies. Obviously, this unit isn't bump-proof for security, but for you what you get, it's solid!"
4,nice for forgetful old ladies,"I purchased this for my vacation house because. I was always walking out without my keys. it is a pretty place in the country and a walk before breakfast was special.....but a not if I forgot to pick up my keys. The Schlage works well and I like the idea of multiple codes for different people, then being able to change them. It was easy to install and easy to program. I feel that. I got a good price compared to what I saw ain the stores. this is a heavy, solid feeling lock and I hope it will continue for many years. Now I can give friends the code so they can use the condo and don't have to get the physical key."
5,Great Lock!,"I purchased this lock, because I own my home and have roommates. When a roommate moves or leaves, I simply change the code to the door. This has made entry into the home easy, and this has provided peace of mind. I would highly recommend this lock."
4,Schlage Camelot Keypad,"I bought this lock because I'm tired of changing the locks on my house due to a teenage son that is irresponsible with his key. It has been the perfect solution, now I just have to change his key code and it doesn't cost me a dime!The deadbolt was very easy to install, I did it myself, and programmed the new key codes all within 20 minutes.My only complaint is that it isn't the most attractive lock ever. The ""handle"" that you turn to open the deadbolt is rather unsightly, as is the turn knob on the inside of the door, but the ease of the lock overrides its looks.I would definitely recommend this lock."
5,Camelot Keypad Deadbolt,"Quick delivery. Simple to install with a Philips screwdriver if the door holes are the correct size - 2 1/8"" for the big hole"
3,Deadbolt,"Nice look, easy to install, but it sticks out too far off the face of the door and hits the storm door handle, would probably be great for other applications were the handles won't collide."
5,Love it!,"I bought this lock for my side door so that my kids could open the door without having to have a key, only because I knew that key would get lost. It's extremely easy to install if you take the time to read the instructions. It took me about 30 min's to install and setup and I'm not that handy. If you press the Schlage button the keypad lights up blue so that you can see the numbers. This is perfect if it is dark and the light isn't on outside. Also, I love the fact that this set doesn't show any wear on the number pad, which is important because if the numbers start to wear off, then people will know what your code is.We all have our own codes in the house so that if by chance my kids tell someone the code, I can just change theirs and be done. This is an awesome lock!"
4,great stuff and for great price,"please remember to keep the paperwork that comes with each lock. In it, there is a unique programming code that you must use to reprogram as you may need to over the years. Other than than, it's a great item that does what is designed to do."
3,No Auto-lock,"The only complaint I have about this lock is it doesn't have an ""auto-lock"" feature. When I purchased it, I assumed it would considering the price. The lock is very well made and feels secure. Installing and setting the codes was a breeze."
2,"Poorly manufactured deadbolt, Missing Instructions and Keycodes","The lock was a giant pain to install, requiring three separate installations to make it work. After the first install there was a burr in the deadbolt that prevented the bolt from coming out. I filed that down, and installed it a second time. Next, I went to program it, and the only place the programming codes existed were on THE BACK of the keypad, so I had to uninstall it all over again. Nowhere in the instructions does it mention to write down the codes first-- there was supposed to be a ""programming guide"", but that was not in the box anywhere."
3,"Ok, but not what I thought I was getting!","The lock was fairly easy to install. It just wasn't the more sophisticated version I thought it was. For the price paid, it was a good value though. So, we'll keep it until we can get the intended version at a deal."
2,broke after 18 months,"Had one of these installed by a professional locksmith on front door of office. Needed to change the code about 18 month after the initial install and was unable to. Called Schlage and was informed that the lock was malfunctioning (broken). Thus, had to replace lock."
5,Nice lock for the price,"This lock is exactly what I was hoping for. It was easy to install, it allows me into my home without a key (we never carry them), and it accepts individual codes for each member of the family and select others. Also, the codes are easy to add and subtract. The only negative that I see, and it may not be for some, is that the box is really large on the inside of the door. I wasn't expecting that, but you do get used to it. Great overall value and easy to use unit."
3,Schlage BE365,"The product was very easy to install. The major complaint is that it says ""keypad illuminates so you can see it at night"" when in actuality it is only the Schlage symbol that lights up. If I had known this prior to purchase I would have purchased a different lock. Should save tonnes of money from lost key replacement, however."
4,Quality Safety lock with keypad,Easy install once I got a locksmith to change key to match rest of house. Installation is easy. One minor problem issue was the unmatched screw used to hold interior cover. Just throw it away; the two matching screws to use are in the parts kit. Had to reach a supervisor to explain why I could not find matching screw; the single screw used to hold parts in box has no matching screw to find. She apologized and said she gets the same confused call many times a week...
3,Buyer beware. Weak link is the standard key and pin/tumbler setup,"I installed one of these for a client and it seems to be a good product as all the reviewers say. What no one has talked about however is the standard Shlage key that can also be used to open the lock. It seems to me that this would allow the possibility of using a ""bump key"" to open it. One of the benefits of digital locks is their immunity to bumping. If you want the keypad just for convenience, that is fine. Just remember that any lock that can be ""bumped"" provides zero security."
2,Very difficult to install.,If the holes drilled out for the deadbolt on your door are not perfectly level then you will not be able to install these and will acquire a great deal of frustration. The tolerances in how the screw lines up are maybe 1 mm. The return process wasn't the most stress free either. I have installed a lot of locks while re-keying foreclosure properties so I have an above average experience level with locks and the company treated me like I was a piss idiot. I only got one of two installed and when I did use it the lock was very sporadic in its operation and actually locked me out of house once.
5,Great lock,"Bought this to replace a standard deadbolt that was getting harder and harder to use as it was ""sticky"" and key woundn't turn easily. I am single mom and never replaced a deadbolt before. This deadbolt is very substantial. I took my time and read the directions...also Schlage has some YouTube videos available that helped alot. I was able to install this in about 15 minutes. I found the programming to be easy and the lock works wonderfully. I really appreciate being able to run back in the house after starting the car...and not having to remove keys from the ignition. Living in FL, that helps as I can keep the AC blowing in the car especially if my dogs are with me, which they almost always are. So happy I bought this. So far my family loves it."
5,Really easy to use,I had a similar Schlage model in my previous home and loved it so much I insisted on purchasing one for our new home. I really like that our family can access our home without distributing house keys.
4,Easy to Install and Operate,"The install was straightforword. I already had an existing deadbolt, so I didn't have to cut a new hole. I really liked that the inside panel installed with a screw top and bottom. Very easy. When the inside handle is engaded on the inside it has a solid feel unlike my previous deadbolt. The number pad is lighted on the outside...great for when the kids get off work late. Great lock. Looks good and operates nicely."
3,Good but not great,It got really cold (negative 10) and quit working. I could hear it click when I typed the code but it wouldn't catch either for locking or unlocking. The key wouldn't work for unlocking the door either. Luckily I could open the garage to get in. Once it warmed up a bit it started working again.
2,Shorted out,"We purchased one of these locks for our back door and an apartment that that we own. We did like the convenience, at least until it did not work. We have just gone through about five days of heavy rain which seemed to short out some of the buttons. Currently, none of the buttons are working which has left my wife stranded with our two kids. locked out of the house. As I am writing this review, I am on hold waiting to speak with Schlage customer service.....(8 minutes later). They have said that they would replace the lock, but it would take about 20 days to send us a new one........This may be the exception to a relatively good product but I'd rather not wait nearly a month to use our main entry."
5,Love it!,"This lock is wonderful. It holds multiple combinations, is easy to install, and easy to use. I love being able to go for a jog, walk the dog to the park, run to the gas station, etc and not have to bring my keys! Guys might not care that much, but ladies often have extremely small or nonexistent pockets, making bulky, noisy key rings an annoying requirement on these quick outings.My husband also went on a long spiel about how nice this lock is compared to other keyless deadbolts because of the way the locking mechanism works. It saves lots of battery power and doesn't have a small motor in it. Which means not only does the battery last longer, but there aren't any motors to degenerate over time. I won't say anything more to try to mitigate the risk of talking from the top of Mount Stupid.Bottom line: I really REALLY like this lock. I felt it was well worth the money."
1,do not buy,I could not program one of the locks I bought. The mfg. would not help as they stated they do not help with intertnet sales like e-bay cregs list or on line stores.
4,very convinient,"We love not having a key to losse in the garden or on our dog walks. Was not able to add a password even following the writen instructions, will have to call customer service to add new codes for neighbors to check on our pets."
5,"Wish I got one years ago, better price than elsewhere","We had one of these at our last house, and when we were selling it, it was fantastic, no keys for the realtor or workmen, etc. You can assign temporary codes and then erase them. No more worrying about lost keys or security lapses. Works great. This is the second one we have bought, and will probably add one to a vacation home. Even better to use there, since renters, etc. would not need to worry about a key. If the battery starts to die it gives you a red blink. You can hide an emergency key if it fails, but we have never had to use it. Get one! You will love it!"
5,Great auto deadbolt,We had a kwikset auto bolt previously and had many problems with it. This one seems to be constructed of much higher quality materials. I also love the feature: before the code is entered the outside lock just spins so there is no forcing it open. High quality. Easy to install and operate. Uses a nine volt instead of many AA's. We are very happy with this product!
5,Great Fun!,"SOULSEARCHERS COMPANY, written by the award-winning Peter David (and Richard Howell). The Soulsearchers are a screwball team ofpsychic investigators. The adventures usually have a satirical slant, but can be serious, too. Sometimes at the same time. I deliberately use the term ""screwball,"" because theinteraction between the male lead (a fire demon from an Arabic Hell) and the female lead (a former olympic athlete, with a magic vaulting pole . . . no, really) is reminiscent ofthe old screwball comedies: witty, barbed, and very funny dialogue. Any comics fan with a sense of history will recognize the artists: Dave Cockrum and Jim Mooney. Need Isay more?"
1,science or pseudoscience,this book was just too in depth for me. did not like it at all. one day soon i will go over it again. would never recommend it.
3,"So, So...","My husband loves to cook homemade pizzas so we ordered this baking stone with the intentions of cooking his pizzas. We cooked 5 or 6 pizzas on it before it started to infuse a weird taste into our pizza crust as they cooked. We were cleaning the stone just as the instructions said, so I know it wasn't anything that we had done. We used it a few more times for pizzas before we decided to get a different stone to use. We still use it periodically for warming bread or such in the oven but I wouldn't recommend it for pizzas."
2,Cracked the first time used,"Received this as a Christmas gift, as I had expressed an interest in making pizza from scratch. Today I decided to use it for the first time, to heat up a frozen pizza. Per the instructions, I put the frozen pizza on the room temperature stone before putting in the oven. The instructions had no specific information about how long to to let them sit so I waited about 2 minutes before putting into a preheated 425 degreee F oven. The stone cracked about 3-4 minutes after putting in oven.I guess if I had to do it again I'd let the pizza sit for 10 - 15 minutes before putting in the oven (even though the pizza instructions tell you not to thaw first), and I might also forego the preheating. Disappointing."
5,Love it!,"This product is great for the price, the only thing I wish it had is handles, but other than that its a wonderful baking stone so far!"
3,music for a very special type of listener,"when you listen to this record you will feel you're on a monastery or abbey in the middle ages! So, it requires a very special type of listener to enjoy it. If you are this type, however, you will find it very rewarding, it's certeinly music of the highest caliber in its way. Lucien Castier, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"
2,same old Jungian analysis with title more exciting than text,"When I ordered this book, I thought, WOW!, I've been looking for a good, well-researched book about the Devil's Grandmother, Wife, and Daughter. This book is not that. It reminds me much more of anti-feminist texts written by women on 'evil in fairy tales' and such that I read in the early 70s. The essays are poorly conceived. If you think this might be like a text by James Hillman, forget it, or a text by Jack Zipes, forget it. We still need a book with this title, but with a much improved text. If you're looking for this sort of thing, I'd suggest you read Clarissa Pinkola Estes instead."
3,"Good, but nothing new","At the Soundless dawn is a solid debut with an incredible line up of musicians, but really, this is just another post-rock album. Nothing new here is being brought to the table, though it is still a fine listen.Don't take this review as completely negative, I enjoy this album and suggest checking it out. It's just that most of these reviews are a bit hyped. Is this 5 star material? Absolutely not."
3,Filler Eps from an Otherwise Great Season!,"If you are picking and choosing which volumes to keep, you can safely give this one a miss without missing too much. The first episode is interesting though because the theme is very similar to the V'ger story from the first Star Trek movie. The tension and tight plot are redeeming factors to an otherwise average episode.The second and weaker episode shows an emotionally vulnerable Kirk who questions himself and his abilities when a number of his crew die on an Eden-like planet behaving as if he is a rookie captain who has only just lost members of his crew on dangerous assignments. The rest of the episode is very forgettable and ranks among the worst of all 3 seasons combined."
4,The Changling /The Apple,"""The Changling"" a great story with excellent SFX. ""The Apple"" considered one of the poorly written episodes of TOS. However, it does contain a few highlights...watch Yeoman Landon...she's got a real nice kick!"
4,Nice Small Shaver,This shaver is small enough so it's perfect for the road. But it shaves close enough so you can use it everyday.
3,It is OK...,"I gifted this piece to my husband for his Bday. He tried it and said its not that good. Since he use to shave for every 2 days,this one is not that effecient for 2 days hair. Maybe,its good for daily use or less hair. But,for my husband,whenevere he use this ,he has to use the normal razor again to have a clean shave. And its not working for his chin part and neck part.Overall I can say,its OK only.Not upto my expectation."
4,Cool Little Shaver,Works great. Little noisy and does NOT come with cleaning brush. Need to clean after every shave. Good value though.
5,great shaver!,"I bought this shaver for the road trip did not expecting much. My regular shaver is Panasonic Nano shaver that costs well above hundred dollars. I was shocked to see that this little shaver shaves better than the other one! I did get some slight skin burn, but other then that it did excellent work!"
3,I don't like it,"It requires two AA batteries, and it produces lots heat when using it.Don't really like it."
1,Unsatisfactory,"After using this about 10 times I'm ready to throw it away. Although it is small and cuts one day growth OK (I do not have a heavy beard), if you miss a hair or two (and who doesn't) and it grows to 1/8"" or longer, you may as well forget it. This razor WILL NOT cut it.If there was an extendable trimmer on the razor, I would have rated it a 4!"
2,not very useful,"this shaver couldn't cut a baby, it really doesn't get the job done even if u give your face the time to adjust, I can't say its worth the money"
3,"Decent little shaver, and I mean little!","Bought this a few weeks ago, and these are my impressions:1. It is very small. The actual shaving head is about 1/2 to 2/3rds as long as a typical shaver. This means it takes longer to shave.2. Shaves just great.3. Works just great in the shower. This is my first wet/dry shaver and I love shaving in the shower now!4. It is NOT rechargeable. I should have noticed that because it is clearly stated in the amazon page, but I have never heard of a battery powered NON-rechargeable razor before! Surprise!5. It burned through a set of two AA batteries in about a week or 10 days for me. I bought some NiMH rechargeables and they are working fine so far.Hope this helps!(...)"
4,Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve Compact Mens Shaver,"It's not quite as powerful as the full size shavers, but it does give a good wet shave. The one advantage I see it having over rechargeables is that you don't have to worry about the nicad battery losing its ability to hold a charge because it runs on 2 AA batteries. It's been my experience that the battery will give out before the actual mechanics of the shaver. So theoretically I should get more use out of this shaver."
4,Very compact,This is very good wet and dry shaver(battery operated one) I have come across. I liked it. It gives very nice and smooth shave. So far giving good battery life too.
1,"Eventually, unusable for me","I really wanted to like this shaver. I travel 2-3 nights per week on business and left my larger Panasonic shaver in a hotel so when I replaced it, I bought one of these too.I love the size and the shape. I love that I can use rechargable AA batteries and that it will hold a charge for WEEKS!!But the problem is it frequently cuts me. I'm not pushing hard but it just seems to suck up skin under my chin or along the bottom of my neck. I get a horrible rash as well as cuts. It's not worth using.I have stopped taking it with me and gone back to brining my full-sized Panasonic ES8152 with me. Now that is a nice shaver (when the blades are sharp) but it needs better batteries."
2,"It's OK in a pinch, but I'll take a full size razor because","This one pulls my neck hair and isn't really all that effective at a clean shave. Even in the shower it is very difficult to get a clean shave for my medium beard. I wish I wouldn't have left my rechargable panasonic in the hotel, it worked great.."
1,Too much noise,My husband had a shaver which he used for 10 years. It was very quiet until recently. I purchase this one as a replacement. It shocked and disppointed me that it made much bigger noise than the one of 10 years old. It is a waste of money no matter how cheap it is.
5,Sets you free to hike,"This bag helps me get back to the business of hiking. It keeps my binoculars comfortably and safely out of the way but also makes the binoculars instantly available. I've been using this bag to put the nose of my long-lens DSLR camera into to help ease the weight of carrying a heavy camera. This is a well-built product, balanced and designed to make it comfortable to carry binoculars plus other things into the areas you want to explore."
5,A pricey bag that's worth it,"It's nice when you can find something that does its advertised job and does it well. This little bag easily fits full sized binoculars, a field guide, and a few other little things, all easily accessible. I can also use it as a camera case when I have the binoculars around my neck. For a birder, this is a great bag."
1,A SHAMEFUL RANT,"That this sorry excuse for literature is even in print is explained by the fact that it is self-published. Indeed why would any self-respecting publisher endorse what amounts to self-righteous hate-mongering which, in this case, targets the gay community of San Francisco? The only people who could be ""inspired"" by the actions of ""author"" Pastor McIlhenny have a dangerously, sadly skewed view of Christianity which is, last time I looked, a religion rooted in forgiveness and love of one's fellow man. ""Wicked"" is about neither, and why it is linked to Amazon's gay section is unfathomable."
1,Homophobic bilge,"Yes, I have actually read this book. It is the usual Bible-thumpery with the inevitable Christian fixation on the sexual sins, especially every right-winger's favorite sin, homosexuality. Gee, I always thought that the Bible said that ALL have come short of the glory of God, ""Not one of you is perfect"", ""Let him who is without sin cast the first stone"", etc. Nowadays, there are even some major sins such as gluttony which don't get denounced at all. Gluttony was listed as one of the Seven Deadly Sins. When was the last time you heard a sermon against gluttony? When was the last time you heard of a church organist being fired for gluttony? And if San Francisco is so wicked, why hasn't God sent the fire and brimstone yet? Why complain about cities that are full of sinners, when ALL men are sinners, and therefore ALL cities are full of sinners? Are you one of the righteous who is smug about Joplin being destroyed by a tornado because of the sinfulness of the Joplinites?"
4,Great!; came with some paint and scratch defect,The product is no doubt the greatest thing for baking and make yor pie cooked evenly. But the one I got arrived with some defects: an uneven paint at the pink part and the bottom edge got a scratch. This pink-color option you partially donate to the cancer research.
2,nope,My pup had it for about 3 days.She is a small chikkpoo and it came off very easy.I would not buy again.Price is OK compared to others.Maybe would be better for a dog less active.
3,Does the job,"I got this as a cheaper alternative for my dog. It does the job, but I have a few complaints. 1) The smell of the collar is very strong and took about three weeks to go away. I am not sure if that's safe for the dog, myself, or my furniture, as it's clear it's the flea repellent that smells so strong. 2) The reflector material comes off almost immediately. 3) The buckle that is supposed to hold it in place is cheap and I have to resize it around his neck often.That said, the price is great, since these things can be very expensive. I am not sure I will buy again, though, since I do not want to have to go through that three-week limbo of now know if the smell means something harmful."
5,best cd i have ever bought,"i have been a fan of the trailers for three years since i saw them perform in a tiny bar in south texas. There live performances are uncomparable to anyone else i have ever seen, and this cd brings together all the passion of those performances. Stokes song writing is incredible, the best singer songwriter i have heard. Every song evokes strong emotions in those who listen to it. There sound is unique and cannot really be classified, and that is what makes it great. If you only buy one cd this year there is no better one than this."
3,Not bad but not good,"One reviewer said this was ""Bon Jovi goes to Nashville"". Well he's pretty close in that analogy. I've listened to this album several times and it just doesn't do much for me. It's pleasant and fairly well crafted and recorded but it's not memorable. How somebody could rate this their number 1 country rock album is beyond me. Gosh you could probably rate 1000 other country rock albums ahead of this. Every album by Firefall, Pure Prairie League, Poco, Loggins & Messina, Steve Earle, Pat Green, CSNY, Byrds, Blue Rodeo..........................."
4,Tamrac 697,I purchased this item mainly for its rolling capability. I find that it is a very good quality constructed item and it will fit most of my needs. I did find that it is a shorter depth bag .Tamrac 697 Big Wheels Rolling Backpack LP7 (Black)and I can not fit my Canon 580 flash standing up. It also has less room than my other Tamrac back pack. I am very satisfied with this product and I would recommend it.
4,Teens Will Love This,"Christy Miller is a fourteen year old girl who is staying with her aunt in California for the summer. While in Cali, she makes two new friends and her life isn't the same after.I have always heard and seen the Christy Miller series and I was excited when I got the chance to review them! Nothing about this book disappointed me, I love the plot along with all of the characters. The close attention to detail, sucked me in to her world full of ups and downs.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
5,A special place in my heart,This series of books has a special place in my heart and played a role in my greater understanding of God as a pre-teen and middle-school student. I am buying them now for my niece who is in 6th grade in hopes that she too will one day have a special place in her heart for Christie and her revelations.
2,"Confusing, with a dubious moral, but entertaining","The most startling thing about this book is Christy's wild mood swings. I got exhausted just reading about how she went from angry to hopeful to sad to despondent to cheerful to excited to happy to angry every few minutes. Of course, she IS a teenager, so this is largely excusable. I liked how the author didn't shy away from sex and drugs in the story, and she kept the story moving at a good pace. However, I found the moral rather dubious: Wear a lot of makeup and stylish clothing and become a Christian and other kids will accept you. At least that's what I made out the moral to be, since the kids were mean to Christy before she started dressing in style, and ambivalent towards her before she became a Christian. I was also very confused by Todd and Tracy's behavior, although it got a little less confusing at the end of the book. I may or may not read the rest of the series to find out what happens next."
2,summer promise,"Christy Miller is a regular fourteen your old girl, and during the summer decides to stay with her Aunt Marti, and Uncle Bob. in Escondido, California.While she`s there, she finds fitting in is soemthing that is very important to her. She is introduced to a group of people on the beach by her best friend Todd. Will Christy find that this group is best for her?"
1,does not WORK!,"i can not turn it on..., the one i received was broken.who ever sent this to me, please contact me asap.thanks"
1,Panasonic ES518N Ultra Thin Dry Travel Shaver,To put it so everybody will be able to understand: it's a piece of $h!t This is the worst shaver I have ever used.
5,great for travel not shave.,"nice design. feels solid in your hand. good for travel. but the smaller size compromises shave quality. after owning this for awhile, i find that i still take my bigger shaver on the road (and i'm a frequent traveler). so you may not really need it even if you think you do."
3,Solid with a thin physique,"This is a dense, solid, compact unit. Heavier than other models I've used but very thin and attractive. I have thick facial hair and the screen holes are a bit small, works best if used when stubble is fresh and short."
3,Elegant but not very useful,"Positive:- VERY elegant design!(personally, I would have preferred a ""silver"" case, instead of gold)- low battery consumptionNegative:- no trimmer- small shaving area, with that slow shave (a large part of the foil area does not even have holes)- tendency to catch a single hair, and then not cut it ""fast enough"".Result, as you ""move on"" the shaver pulls those hairs. That hurts.- unexpectedly heavy- NOT water resistant (no ""wet/ dry"" shaves).This makes cleaning of the tiny cutter block more difficult.- cleaning brush not ""clipped into"" the case (as with the Braun 370)I.e.. if you have to keep the brush separately, why not make it large?Summary:This shaver is mostly about ""style"".Should impress the hotel's staff, when you leave it on the dresser."
2,Drier than a Martini - Whats the Hype?,"I expected much more. Dry and tedious, Mr. Kershaw pacts each page with wave after wave of flat, colorless data. Nothing new, and certainly no personality - but then that woud require creativity and daring - something histroians dare not undertake with repect to the subject of NAZI Germany. Lots of boring, lifeless information.Would like to see David McCullough tackle his subject...a la his ""John Adams""."
1,Kershaw's Bunker,"This book, promising to be a novel account of the twilight of the Fuhrer's momentous struggle against the menace of judeo-bolshevism, is full of what Hitler himself would call talmudistic pettifoggery but says nothing new. Indeed, the only good parts seem lifted directly from the brilliant David Irving's pathbreaking, revisionist ""Hitler's War."" The rest is just plain uneventful. For example, there still is NO repeat NO evidence of a written order concerning the necessary internment camps, a fact that must horrify the hysterical Ms. Lipstadt no end. Save your time for the Fuhrer's own fascinating ""Mein Kampf"" and ""Table Talk."""
3,Stick with the Bradt guide,"I don't regret buying this because there aren't too many guides to Madagascar. But there is simply no personality to this book. If you are looking for some names/addresses, this would suffice. Otherwise, the Bradt guide blows this Lonely Planet guide away."
2,A bit outdated,"We used this guide, along with 2 other guides of Madagascar and we found this guide to be the least valuable of the 3 (a bit outdated, not into depth)"
2,You can do better.,"My husband and I bought this book a couple of years ago, as we were going to Madagascar with the Peace Corps. When we got to Madagascar, we realized that everyone else had bought the Bradt guide, which is far superior to this book. We ended up using an old copy of the Bradt guide whenever we were travelling around the country, because this Lonely Planet didn't get us very far. If you are planning to get off the main tourist routes, this book is all but useless.So, you might want to check out your other options before you buy this."
1,Warning: Editions out of whack,"This fakebook is published in C, Bb, and Eb versions. The C version is now on the 3rd edition. But the publisher has not yet sold out of the 2nd editions for the Eb and Bb books, and so have not gotten around to releasing 3rd editions for the other keys. The editions are badly out of sync, in terms of the songs they contain, and sometimes even the key of the song. You can't use these split editions in an ensemble setting, so if you're getting this to play with friends who already have the older edition, avoid this one like the plague.The low star rating, however, is for the song selection and generally hard-to-read (chords are too small, poor use of whitespace, and songs broken awkwardly across pages) typesetting that you find in most Hal Leonard fake books."
2,More a miss than a hit,"There are some gems in here for certain, however I agree with the other reviewer who stated that if you're 40+ you won't find a wealth of time tested standards. Also for guitar players the difficulty I would place at intermediate to advanced due to the keys and (perhaps needless)chord complexities (no mini-charts with the chords which would have helped with all of the obscure ones). I have two other fake books from Hal Leaonard ( Christmas guitar and Folksongs )and I can't imagine that this group was gathered by the same team since I really like the other titles. I had several other Hal Leonard fake books on my ""wish list"" but now that I find the compilations inconsistent in quality I won't buy any more sight unseen."
3,Best Ever?,"Not bad, but I have some of the other series like ""Ultimate"", etc., and find more useful tunes in some of them... I was looking for more of the real ""Oldies"" but this seems heavier into 60's & 70's... I did find ""Hard Hearted Hannah"" which is a good, fun piece..."
5,"fake book for ""C"" instruments.","Music is excellent, tho some is rather simplified. Paper is crappy but there is plenty of great music from Niel Diamond to the Beetles."
1,biggest waste of money don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I don't know where they picked their songs from but not a decent one in the book.please save your money and buy ANYTHING ELSE BUT THIS
5,Very enjoyable,"I started playing violin at a much later age. I am finally at the stage where I can play songs! The Best Fake book ever gave me the opportunity to play songs that I know. It is very exciting. I wind up practicing for over an hour, continuously choosing other songs to play. The book offers a break from scales, techniques and possible frustration. It's a great way to play and have fun."
1,Wildfire,"Dreadful film, the acting was terrible and there was nothing really to do with the horses in it. I am glad I didn't pay full price for it"
1,Total Junk! Avoid wasting your money on this camera!,"This camera stopped working only after 6 months. The optical zoom lense got stuck often. The display screen went blank, and now it is completely useless."
2,Poor Casio service (and product)!,"The push button (Casio Exilim Z850) to take shots fell off in 8 months. The service center needs 3 weeks just to get the part. Leaving for Asia in 19 days; called Casio directly for help and was told flat out ""if that's what they told you, it's what it is, okay"".I will go back to Canon the next time I am shopping for another camera!Jane, Saratoga/California"
2,It died!!!,"I'm so dissapointed. I really wanted to love this camera: it had gotten such great reviews. It is a very sharp looking camera, it has a great set of features, and every digital camera web site seems to love it. I took the day off from work and planned on testing it but after 8 shots, the thing went dead. The lens is stuck out, no lights are on, nothing. And I did follow the instructions and charged the battery for a full 3 hours before using. I did read of some other people having this problem so I think if you get a good one it's a great camera but you may have to deal with returns."
2,Great Features But ......,"Well i bought this camera in july before i went on a camping trip. Let me tell you it has great features and a beautiful large lcd for viewing the pictures. Unfortunatley, after reading all the positive reviews and dropping $400 in it, it has failed to impress me. Sure the photos all look great but as soon as you zoom in in any photo editor, they are all extremly blurry. I honestly got better pictures with a nikon 4mp camera i used the year before. Sure this camera will probably be ok for most who aren't picky about picture quality, but for those who like to edit and manipulate their photos this camera falls short in picture quality."
4,GENIAL,"Para los amigos de habla hispana, recomiendo esta camara como una muy buena opción, no es una camara profesional, pero como se le acerca, exelentes fotos, el video es algo muy bueno, y si la acompañas con una tarjeta de memoria de 2GB es lo mejor. La recomiendo con los ojos cerrados. Lo unico bajar la actualización de la pagina casio..."
4,"The more I use the camera, the better I like it!","This is a handy little camera. I bought it because I wanted a small camera to carry with me. It takes a while to become used to the manual features, but once you do, you can take some nifty close ups. The movies feature is incredible with accurate voice quality and picture. Overall the accuracy of color is excellent too. This camera has met all the expectations I had and more."
4,great little camera,"I've had this camera for about a year and a half and it has worked great. I love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery. Pictures are nice and clear and it's easy to use. My only ""problem"" is that it's so tiny--I prefer a camera that it is a bit bigger and easier to hold onto. My friend's son (just turned four)even took some pretty good pictures when playing with the camera."
4,Updated Video firmware,"At first, the poor video quality almost kept me from purchasing this camera. Nevertheless, I bought it based on its excellent quality still shots (i.e. photographs) as well as the extensive manual control options (perhaps more than any other compact camera). And the photographs are quite nice indeed.Then I found that CASIO has released two new firmwares for the Z850 which dramatically fixes the video quality. I am now quite pleased with this camera. Between the two firmwares available, I preferred to use the version ""1.1b"" instead of the ""1.10"" - to me the video quality was improved much more than the other."
1,Excellent for 2 years only.,"This ""camera"" outperforms many camcorders I've seen. Its picture quality could hardly be improved. Its ease of use and menu structure is intuitive and easy to remember. The long life battery lasts for several hours on video. The high speed SD card option makes it an all-in-one.HOWEVERAfter a couple years, it just stops working; lens out and power on. Just stops functioning. Send it off. ""Downloaded software"". Works great. 2 months later - exact same thing only nobody can tell you why it turnips on you. Repeat the cycle until your lens gets bumped because you can't retract it, then the warranty people say ""the lens isn't part of the camera, so it's time for you to buy another one.""So as long as you're not wanting a camera to last for 5 years like I am, this is great but if you want one that doens't leave you feel like you've been romanced by the prince and then consummated by his porcupine, I strongly recommend you stay away from this POJ. -rod"
1,great little camera..when it works,"I've had this camera for about two years. It has been wonderful. Easy to use, took great pictures, no complaints. A few months ago it started having problems turning off. I'd have to remove the battery when I was done taking pictures every once in awhile. This wasn't an all the time issue, so I dealt with it. Then last weekend at my son's wedding it just stopped. I was turning the camera off when it just froze up, lens still sticking out, and won't do a darn thing anymore. The battery is fully charged, I have never damaged the camera, and really can't justify spending the money to repair it when a new camera will set me back about the same amount. Just makes me sick."
2,EX-X850 Camera - The lens gets stuck frequently,"As the title suggests, this camera's lens system gets stuck. It suddenly resets after a few hours of being stuck. However, currently my camera has been in the stuck position for 3 days now. Now, I get to try Casio service...Will update this review if I get it repaired.However, on the bright side, I have taken just about a 1000 pictures with this camera. It does great with room lighting, sun light. Does not do well with low light. The pictures are superb for a layman's purpose.The videos are awesome quality (for lay people). Videos are good enough to watch on a TV screen!But, this camera does get stuck. BUYER BEWARE!Good luck with yours, if you do decide to buy."
1,Stinker,"I purchased the Casio EX Z850 in August. The second time I used it in November the lens cover began sticking closed and the lens would not retract. When I returned the camera for warranty repair they refused to fix the problems, claiming customer abuse. This camera was never dropped and was used in a most routine way. Casio has refused to honor the 1 year warranty they claim to provide. If you read the reviews of other Casio cameras this lens problem is very common. I would not recommend any Casio camera. Don't buy Casio Cameras, they are stinkers."
1,I hope you don't get a defective Camera Casio's Warranty Proccess is the worst I have seen,"I bought this camera because of the good ratings. I had tried it for a couple of weeks, and it kept taking blurry pictures. I called Casio support, and they had me reset everything and then try it for a couple of more weeks. Of course, by this time, it was too late to return it (I should have followed my instincts and returned it.) I called Casio after several months of blurry pictures (about 80%). First of all, Casio doesn't service the camera, a third part does. Second, you have to pay all expenses to ship the camera to the third party (about $15.00 UPS Ground.) Then the third party sends you a letter a couple of days later telling you they won't repair the camera until you send them $15.00 to mail the camera back to you. On top of this, the newly fixed camera (only 4 months old) only comes with a 90 day warranty. After that, you have to pay all of these fees again. I even buy $9.99 casio watch again."
2,Lens stuck on first day,"This is obviously some kind of known bug with this camera -- like several other people, the lens got stuck in the out position the first day I used the camera. Have to return it now which is a pain! Supposed to be a great camera but obviously has reliability/quality problems."
3,Quotationary review,"Quotes are thoroughly indexed and classified, but few cause a person to stop and change their perception. I was impressed with an average of 1 out of every 60 quotes, equal to 1 per every 3 pages. I liked the feature of them being cross listed by source. I could look up all the quotes by Clint Eastwood, for example."
1,Sub Par,"A - Sources of quotations are very limited in scope : too much bible and/or orthodox cookie cutter morality.B- Categories each have a very limited number of quotes.C - Categories overlap and require you to ""see also x,y,z"" all the damn timeD - Most of the quotes aren't even quotes.. Entire passages of books stand in as quotes, and aren't even very memorable or strongF - My grade for this poor poor book."
2,not for everyone,"You have to really appreciate loud, intense vocal growls to get into this album. It lacks vocal melodies for the most part, and contains unmemorable guitar riffs and solos that were influenced by old school metal bands such as Metallica. The music is just too obnoxious and annoying for me."
3,layo ra sa una nga album!,"una, d kaayo ko ganahan sa bag o nila nga vocalist. i mean, okay sya na vocalist pero d sya bagay sa KsE. kuwang sya sa attitude na naa ni JeSSe (former KsE vocalist). not good. musicwise, d na kaayo nindot ang ilang mix sa melody og brutality. murag pareho rag tono tanan kanta! kng sa AOJB madala ka sa music, diri....... dili! and that is a weak sign. pero naa man poy good points diri sa album. dili lang jd pareho og impact sa una nila nga album. layo ra jud! stay true KsE! ........ur one important band. HAiL! from the philippines!"
2,"More like ""En-Gay-ged""","At first I liked this CD because the 1st 4 song come off as being good. But after that, the songs take a pretty gay turn towards the weepiest, goofiest emo-metalcore that you have ever heard. How about the song ""End of Heartache"" -- simply unlistenable. ""... the end of my BRO...KEN...HEART!"" Yarghh. Their 1st two CDs with Jesse Leach or whatever his name is were a lot better, but now they sound like a heavier version of Staind. Back to the sell-back pile you go, KsE!"
1,We miss Jesse!!!!,"No matter how many times it happens bands will never learn!!! When lose your vox, everthing goes to hell!! Look at Sepultura, max was the only man for the job. This is a perfect example of a great band that lost what their first loyal fans loved. Sorry this was a pretty generic album. If there were negative stars this album would have gotten one."
2,2 1/2 stars,"It's not so much that this is a bad album if you like Killswitch but I just can't get into these guys. I've heard a few songs off of AOJB and I thought they definatly have the ability to rock and everyone and their mom seems to worship them, so I decided to try this album out.Most of their riffs got this kinda ""bubblegum heaviness"" to it...like it's heavy but it's really not....EVERY SINGLE SONG starts off like this and then about 1:30 into the song you'll hear a chorus that makes Creed look heavy. I just can't get into it. I like a little bit of melody in my metal just like the next guy but their chorusus just sound pus#y...but like I said it appears that most of their music follows the this same formula so if you like that ish...then this album rules!"
3,its good but...,let me say this i luv killswitch but buy the one enchanced album has muic vids on rose of shyran and the end of heartache the orginal one not the RESIDENT EVIL version the enchanced dis dersves 5/5
3,to soft for my taste,"after watchin the dvd i cant take this band seriously anymore, they are trying to go mainstream with howard jones who was better sounding with the blood has been shed band."
1,KSE used to be good now they suck,"this album ""the end of heartache"" blows, the new singer blows, i strongly discouage you from buying this. Buy ""alive or just breathing"" by KSE, there old singer is really good(excellent album)"
1,"Wow, this sucks.","For all of you people saying ""THIS IS THE MOST BRUTAL METAL ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD!"" YOU ARE RETARDED! This album is nothing more than emo glazed over with some heavy guitar. And I read one review that called Shadows Fall and NIN poser bands...wow, not even gonna get into that. If you dumb asses want real brutal metal pick up some Behemoth, Decapitated, Cryptopsy, Cannibal Corpse, Vital Remains...stop listening to this whiney emo crap."
1,Stop supporting this kinda of trash...,"I can't belive one of my favorite bands (slayer) chose to tour with these lames... Killswitch engages' "" the end of heartache"" is the ussual lame and boring melodic sound of the unoriginal metalcore crow...They are basically copying each other which makes this realy laughable and dumb. Support slayer because thats actual talent and original music unlike kse."
1,The most overrated band of all time,"Pure mindless drivel from the newest bandwagon in rock. A guy crying over top of cookie-cutter riffs. But hey, who's the real idiot? After all I bought it. It will never happen again."
4,solid,"I can't keep track of all the subgenres of metal...I tend to just separate them by singing style...you got your singers, grumblers, screamers, screachers and growlers. KE falls into my screamer catagory and the new guy is one of the best screamers I have personally heard. Added to his superb vocals is the decent songwriting. I don't really like bands like Hatebreed because the music sucks...just bang out the same chords over and over on your guitar and add some screaming..no good melodies to be found, but KE has managed to add some actual solid melody to go with the nice, angry screaming and mix in some solid singing occasionally to create a very enjoyable CD. I must also add that ""inhale"" is one of the coolest acustic melodies I have ever heard. They should leave the confines of their normal appraoch and make a full song out of it. Their fans would call it ""selling out"" i'm sure, but it could be one of the greatest songs ever. Oh well...I'll take what I can get."
5,"Heavy and Catchy, whats not to like???","I love this album plain and simple, and this is coming from a guy who lives for death metal like kalmah, amon amarth, mors principium est, insomnium, meshuggah and much more.this album is choc full of great riffs and awesome vocals, in fact, im starting to think this is the kind of vocalist in flames are trying to imitate. well there later stuff anyway.all in all this is a great album and in my opinion much better that as daylight dies. check it out!!"
1,Assault on the ears,"Wow. People will buy anything, even a herd of whatever these are screaming into microphones. Were they feeling ill during recording? Were they being tortured while in the studio? Surely no one makes sounds like this outside the bathroom on purpose."
1,Sounds every other nu-metal band...,"Nu-metal and metalcore are the worse genres in music...That i've ever heard.What's so difirent about the two?Nothing at all. Killswitch engage's ""end of heartache"" basically sounds exectly like all those emo bands and nu-metal bands, all thrown together. Might i add, how mediocre the music here, realy is?Its horrible,un-original,repetetive, emo like lirycs, and, weak production as well. I quess its trendy to sound like every one else. I mean, bleedingthrought is doing it,atreyu is doing it. How cool! If you have any self respect? Don't bother."
1,So mediocre it hurts...,"When i hear any song that the metalchannel plays, by either bands like atreyu, kse, as i lay dying... I've to say that im so happy i listing to goregrind & deathmetal which are much superior and has the technical sound that this pu*sy emo mall crap will never dream of having. Nu-metal , emo, metalcore, rap, pop, it's all the same bullsh*t. If you want good music do not buy killswitch engage's "" end of heartache"" because its poison to music. By the way , why emo & metalcore kids all have gay hair styles ? and wear pants that gets stuck insade their a*hole ? Go to hell all of you whiny fa*gots. Go pick up some technical deathmetal bands or goregrind albums and start hearing real music insted of this crap that every song sounds exectly the same. F*ck you all ! Good bands for example? Devourment, kretan, goratory,disgorge,decrepitbirth,gorgasm,cryptopsy,gutrot,christdenied,dehiscence,bound & gagged, and others. Peace the f*ck out !"
2,What a waste...,"Ok, when I first got this I was excited because I love KsE with a passion. I was excited because there were live tracks, and they're Roadrunner live tracks so we know they're good quality. That's the only bonus to the album. The two 'unreleased' tracks, Irreversal and My Life For Yours, have been on the internet since the original was released. If you don't own the original already, get this one definately. However, if you already own the original, there is no reason to buy this one unless you're like me and have to have it all..."
3,Not Quite Killer...,"I enjoyed this CD. I like the contrasting vocals but I would reverse the ratio - more clean, less scream. Too much screaming is like putting ""!"" after every sentence - it loses it's impact. I would not characterize this as that dreadful emo garbage, I'd put it up there with Shadows Fall (not quite up there but close). My biggest complaint is that lyrically this is quite weak. The lyrics are too vague, they don't really say anything. I know sometimes a singer will write a song that is easily open to interpretation, but it has to say SOMETHING to begin with and I thought many of these songs didn't really say anything, or atleast not enough. That being said, I still thought the singing was good and memorable, well the clean stuff anyway. I think this is a band that could grow and get a lot better. But this is still a good CD. The rhythm & lead guitars were interesting and there were enough tempo changes to stir up a tasty offering."
4,new version of kse,"this was my first kse album but i had heard songs from aojb. they were better. jesse vocal style was much better and fit the band so much better than howard's. howards vocals work better in some places and worse in others. the guitar work and everything else is pretty much the same. there are some pretty catchy riffs on here that get stuck in your head forever. overall i dont think its quiet as good as aojb, but it does come pretty close. you can tell kse is becoming more mainstream (rose of shayrn). so if you like metal and liked aojb, you probly want to check this out, but beware of the new vocal style."
4,Good to have this CD despite vocal shift,Good CD to have but it ain't great like the first one did. Best track that I love is Take This Oath. Big difference is there is two instrumentals instead of one this time around. Wait for Hope is... to sound like a cross Metallica and old school hardcore punk (Just listen to the chants! Ha ha.) Title cut is probably the best extension to come across since their last album. Practice what you preach is how I interpret this album generally overall. Relies on tight structure check out the track Declaration. Whoa.
3,Pretty cool,"Has some nice melodic songs like ""Rose of Sharyn"" and personal favorite ""Wasted Sacrifice"". This is probably the best band of the genre. But let's face it, metalcore/emocore is and will always suck. If this is the only genre you listen to you may hate me for saying this. It's just not progressive, and can be quite boring to tell the truth. Sure, this is lightyears ahead of crap like Hatebreed and Atreyu, but if you want the real deal, try Death, Nevermore or Dark Tranquillity. Want something melodic? Try Leaves' Eyes, In Flames, Tristania or old Soilwork. Just can't go wrong with them...6/10"
3,Not bad not to bad at all........,IF you believe by reading this i have written this band off as being a sell out or thier lastest work not very good your way off. I really do like The end of heartache it's a very different band what it seems from alive or just breathing which is undoubtably thier best album. This has a metal sound which is pretty good my problem with it is the songs aren't in my perspective piece together well enough to contain a good rythm.At all please don't get me wrong i really like this album.there are quite a few songs which stand out especially the end of heartache. Just does not compare to Alive or just breathing which i highly advise you to listen to.
3,Hit or miss,"The end of heartache is a puzzling cd, one minute you're listening to some awesome metal and the next minute you're hearing some horribly out of place clean vocals. Most of this cd is pretty average with the exception of two songs: the first song being Take this oath, it has clean vocals in it, however they fit in a lot better than with the other songs: the second song is Declaration, this is the heaviest and best song on the album. It has a very limited amount of clean vocals in it making the slower section in the song more tolerable.If you are into the whole screaming and then singing and ruining the whole song thing, by all means buy this cd, but if you like just straight forward metal steer far away from this cd.Maybe I'm being a little hard on Killswitch Engage, but I believe that if they just stuck to the heavy stuff they would be much better. When this band rocks they rock, but when they suck they suck really bad."
2,not good,"They have a few good songs... most aren't good. Don't like their new singer at all. The old one was much better, as with their old Cd... thats it"
2,"Not exactly Selling Out... Just ""Cashing In""","There comes a time when experienced seasoned musicians use there talents to cash in. I think this is one of those albums. Even though I feel the album is very much cheesy in a ""Billboard"" sort of way, I must respect them for the catchy hooks, and there ability alone. Good musicians, no doubt. Just a money making attempt at a more mainstream market. I'd use it more for a cup coaster than anything else. But I understand."
3,Not much of a heartache...,"I still miss the old Killswitch singer. With that said, the current vocalist shouts over similar chugging riffs and small lead lines; you know, just like all Killswitch Engage stuff, and similarly, like most hardcore music out there. The only thing is that when he sings, it sounds too much like the band RA. (Check them out, you'll know what I'm talking about.) Besides that, and the ill-fated live version of ""My Last Serenade,"" (he should leave that incredible song alone), it's an album to stay in your cd case, even if you only pull it out once every two months."
3,another one bites the dust!,"THE STORY OF A PHENOMINAL BAND: start with an opening cd which is ok but not as clean as it can be, but there is potential. next album is simply briliant. then the album that turns them to the dark side of music. this is where a number of good bands have gone or are going along with KsE. like In Flames, KsE is playing for popularity. to make money. i know it can be hard to make a living at music but if you are determined and you love what you do, the amount of money made isnt what should make you whole, its the fans who write to you and are waiting all night for the store to open to their fav metal store to pick up your new album. or travel across the country to see you play even thoughj they can barely afford the plane ticket. i dunno if you will make it guys. but i will remember your ""Alive and Just Breathing"" album."
4,Worst Album,"I don't mind Howard on vocals, even though it will never match up to Jesse. The sound is a little more mainstream, but the band is still doing their thing and won't sell out eventually. Singing is fair, not the best. Hopefully they won't sell out at this rate..."
5,ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS THIS YEAR!,I am not kidding i believe this album is one of the best albums to come out this year. i think from autumn to ashes is the bestest band out there right now though. but still I LOVE THIS FREAKIN ALBUM!!!!!!
3,"Good, but not as good as Alive or Just Breathing","The songs are good, the riffs are crushing however, I feel they are trying to reach a more mainstream audience. There is way to much singing. Not that singing is a bad thing, but when you make chorus' that are poppy I get a little angry. It's a shame because when they do get heavy, they get real heavy. The songs are good but not on par with Alive or just Breathing. I don't think the ""pop"" is Howards fault. I mean listen to Blood Has Been Shed. I think Adam D had a lot to do with it. Also, was this CD written for teenage girls? Seems like it. Overal, good CD, would have been better if it came out before Alive or Just Breathing and if it had less of a radio friendly sound."
1,"Blah, is this really better than nu metal?","I kinda see this new wave of American thrash metal/metalcore as just a goofy and trend driven as nu metal. I like metal, but do I really have to like those harmonized Swedish-influence lead guitars? They tread too close to silly 80's power metal for me. Pardon me for not being a Yngwie Malmsteem nut.The singer's vocals are pretty lame too, you can't help but scratch your head at the image of a tatted-up black man singing operatically over metalcore breakdowns. I saw these guys live and their stage presence was irritating, especially Adam D. the guitarist and producer of the band. He reminded me of Wes Borland and hopped around onstage with some BOOTY jean shorts. Definitely not cool.I guess I'll just stick to listening to Kyuss, this band will be declared uncool in a few years."
2,eh...,"2 1/2 stars only because I like KsEOk, to start off this is their worst cd, definitely poor. Howard stick to Blood Has Been Shed. The radio version of The End of Heartache just builds on my disappointment of this album. A few years ago I picked up Alive or Just Breathing and was blown away... I quickly bought their debut self-titled album and couldn't wait for a third. Unfortunately Jesse had to leave the band and in stepped Howard. The end of KsE as I knew it."
3,Its alright,"This Cd is just alright for me. Its no where near as good as Alive or Just Breathing and I wish they would go back to that style. I also like Jesse Leach better than Howard Jones, although he's pretty good too."
4,"Buy it, love it and headbang like a madman","Rose Of Sharyn is my favorite Killswitch Song. I loved Alive or Just Breathing and Element Of One is a close second. Darkness Falls has some awesome blast beats in the beggining and remains a killer track throughout. End Of heartache is an Awesome ehhh ballad is the closest thing to call it. All the osngs have their moments and even the band said they wrote most of this while on the road and sometime may feel a little rushed. But its not disappointing at all. Its a solid metal album.Theres alot to be happy about on this record. The inside cover mad for a cool tattoo across my back and when I saw them live got me a chance to hang with the band and get there set list and stuff. Good times.Also buy the new Unearth, Inflames, Cradle of Filth, Shadows Fall , 3 inches Of blood and The Haunted. Melodies run my life."
4,Back with a Vengeance! Sort of,"When I was buying this album, I wasn't to sure because I really thought they were a little to over-rated and mainstream, but I still bought it anyway and I love the band now. The only songs that are a little to whiny and mainstream are ""Rose of Sharyn"" and ""The End of Heartache"". The others were pretty well written and fast, and heavy. Track 6 has a Guitar solo, and is the only one. I don't know why they don't do more, they have great oppurtunities to put them in the songs, but they don't. My favorite song is probably ""When Darkness Falls"" its a nice heavy song to bang your head to. These guys are on Ozzfest 2005, check it out for yourselves at ozzfest.com. Well just get the cd if you like heavy, rockin' music. Its a good cd."
1,Zero stars for sell outs!!!!,"Ok, if you're thinking of buying this CD, don't. Please, do yourself a favor and check out their first release - self titled, and no, not the remixed version. If you're looking for metal, ""The End of Heartache"" doesn't even have a trace... it's straight-up emo... wannabe hardcore... and just plain boring, the entire time. I give it zero stars for a good band going horribly wrong, and selling themselves out. Good job, Killswitch..."
1,Stay away.,"I call this the generic side of not even metalcore but softcore at its best. I mean, from the first track to the last ? Its soft and has horrible melodis with unspering lirycs and cheesy mediocre riffs. Who ever loves trl,mtv,pop music and wants to be trendy? Get yourself a copy of all this bandsKillswitch engagebleeding throughtkittiekornlimp bizkitslipknotevergreenterriblechingygoodcharlotteatreyublink182and the list goes on and on. If you're true to metal and despise the mainstream? Stay away from Kse's "" end of heartache"" Just look at the album title? It doesn't get any more gay,emoish,faggy then that...What a disgrace!"
3,It's OK,"This album is definitely not anywhere near as good as the previous album with Jesse. I still think its pretty decent but not great. The best cuts on the album are Bid Farewell, When Darkness Falls, (the original version sounded cleaner adn better), Rose of Sharyn and Declaration.I liked Jesse's vocals better though. Howard's vocals just sound too overwhelming and Jesse just sounded perfect for the Killswitch sound. I must admit the guy who said Howard's vocals sound nu-metal obviously needs to get his ears cleaned."
5,Excellent follow-up to a master-piece!,"A lot of people compare this disc to AOJB. Keep in mind that this isn't the same band that recorded Alive or Just Breathing. While changing 40% of the line-up from that disc they have managed to stay true to the sound that made them one of the greatest metal bands around today. They have thrown in a little more melody on this one but, it's done very well. The 2 new members fit in very well, both performing masterfully throughout the whole disc. I was a little apprehensive at first listen. But, like any other great album, you can't fully grasp the concept of it with just a few listens. The more I listen to it, the more I appreciate the growth in musicianship and songwriting in this band. This is by far the album of the year to this point. If you're an old fan of KSE you already know what to expect, brutality, power, and a little melody thrown in for good measure. If your new to Killswitch, hold on for a wild ride!"
3,Good but not amazing,"I loved AOJB! It was so unique and came out ina time when metal was pretty saturated and wasteful. While this is a good record I think Adam d. has been spending too much time working with otehr bands and not enough with his own. the production is good, the ehavyness is tehre, Howard does a great job but the song writing and progression from the last lp is just satisfactory."
4,Brandon Wetzel is the biggest F**ktard....,"...He brings new definition to the term f**king retard. All he does is go around and review bands that aren't as heavy as he'd like them to be. Slipknot is understandable, since most ""true"" metalheads hate Slipknot. (I personally think they're quite talented) But he gives no reason as to why he hates them. All he says is ""Nu-metal and mallcore sucks...hahahahaha..."" Very articulate, Brandon. I'll bet you made it all the way to third grade, and then it got too f**king difficult for your numb skull. Well, you can shove it, you wasteless piece of rat s**t. Go listen to Cradle of Filth, while you beating off and slitting your wrists, you dumbf**k."
4,Very good.,"Second CD in pack only has 5 songs, so not a true double album and also has a repeat of End of Heartach song mixed differently. Overall great, just because it's Killswitch Engage."
5,CD in great shape! Lightning fast Delivery!!,Item came just as described and contained the heavy metal prescription that I needed for complete and total azz whipping!!! Great purchase!
3,No Quicktime video support,"I love using the old SONY Screenblast VideoFactory. When I saw the integrated DVD options in the SONY Vegas Movie Studio, I thought it would be a good time to upgrade to a newer version. First thing I did was try the trial download from SONY, and it is a good thing I did. SONY Vegas Movie Studio does not support Quicktime, *.mov, imports (the old VideoFactory does). This may not be important to some users, but my digital camera only records Quicktime video and I want to use it in my family productions. I recommend trying the 30 day fully operational free trial version from the SONY web site before you buy."
1,Why won't it burn?,"I had the same problem as another reviewer. I spent hours on a project only to learn that it will not burn your final project to DVD as it is advertised. I was gonna call sony for support, only to learn that if you want to talk to anyone, you must purchase an expensive ""support plan"" What a joke. Go with Pinnacle."
2,AMATURES BEWARE !,"Yes, despite the hype, this is strictly a professional program...that is unless you have HOURS to struggle with the non-intuitive controls or the ""tell you half the story then leave you hanging"" instructions. To avoid frustration, check out the other programs that are more amature friendly. Yes , you can - and I have- make wonders with this program but it isn't worth it."
3,"This is the older version 4.0, not the most recent 6.0 version","I bought this software assuming I would get the most recent version, 6.0. When I received it I was surprised to find out I bought the old version 4.0 for the about the same price as what I could buy the new 6.0 version for!"
1,Useless software,"After countless hours this software is not at all user friendly , overly complex, and mostly marketing hype. Buy a Mac and use iMovie to save the frustration from this awful product."
5,In Junk Lies Beauty,"What a wonderful treasure is this deceptively simple novel. I found myself reading it slowly, not wanting it to end. Richard and Theresa are not your usual protagonists. Richard is depressed, self-absorbed, and afraid of life. Theresa takes responsibility for the world and is impossible to get along with. Yet I found myself rooting for them, wanting these misplaced people to find their place in the world.And as a person who loves thrift shops and yard sales, I delighted in the author's obvious love of junk. Zadoorian waxes philosophical about the appeal of the secondhand, the thrill of the hunt. Little did I know how much meaning there was in junk! And of course, the fact that the action takes place in my own backyard, geographically speaking, made it all the more fun to read. A most promising debut."
5,One of the finest books about Michigan life I've ever read,"Being a Michigander is a strange thing: you're caught in a state that time has passed by, leaving behind only memories and gutted buildings along with a mentality that still acts like those times have never gone. In a way, living in Michigan is sort of being an Americana zombie that exists in a state of nostalgia and a cynical future mixed with a present of confused emotions of love, hate, and regret.The author captures this perfectly while providing an epic love story that doesn't fall to convention. I'm not much for 'junk,' but as a Michigander I really connected with this novel and, oddly enough, I don't feel alone in my Michiganness anymore. It captures the feeling of how it is being an inhabitant of this state and the constant mixed feelings of hope and despair."
4,Can't put it down,"This funny, sweet book, written in the language of a true junker, is a real delight. It moves along quickly, has characters you will care about, and it makes you laugh."
1,Second Hand junk,"This is one book I can easily ""pawn off."" I found no depth to the story, no interest in the ill-descriptive junk-hunting excursions and no humor in the shallow lusty excapades. I felt that the writing style was unsophisticated and contained unnecessary language. I wish the author the best, but I couldn't force myself to finish his first novel."
2,In fair condition,"This was a bit of a disappointment; in fact, if it wasn't such a quick read, I probably would not have finished it. The narration and pacing are a bit off. Sometimes it seems like a hodgepodge. I suppose that could have been done on purpose."
1,"Me, me, me, I, I, I, my, my, my. . .","I read and listen to many books a month. I must say this is the WORST book that I have listened to (audible) dare I say, ever?!? His name dropping, narcissistic tirade was scattered, pointless and well, BORING. And believe me, I have a high threshold for the tedium.What a disappointment! Don't waste your money!"
5,Wow!!!,"As a born and bred New Yorker(also as a fellow Astoria,Queens kid) this book made me laugh,cry,get angry and yada yada yada.In a nutshell,this is a truly honest book that everyone can and will appreciate.(Unless of course,your tastes are based on some professor's prententious reading list).Dito purged himself on paper and what's fallen on these pages is pure heart.Just read it folks and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about..."
5,Great Book and Movie.,"I saw the movie before I purchased the book. I really enjoyed the movie and I had to buy the book to make the comparison. While I found them to be quite different I really enjoyed both in their places. The book was scattered at times but always honest. You really get a sense that you are hearing about Dito's life with out a filter, the flaws as well as the triumphs. I would recommend this book to anyone between 16 and 60 (especially if you've ever lived in New York)."
4,a great find,"what the author did with this book that i find most appealing is take a world that i have absolutely have nothing in common with and at it's end i felt it was about me. 26 moments at least! This book is full of ""moments"" saints and great inspiration. I highly reccomend it."
1,Narcissistic,"Sure there are some ""moments"" in this book, but it contradicts itself so often that I was left wondering if Mr. Montiel originally wrote this piece as a fan/love letter to himself. The author spends the majority of his time trying to convice us what a tough but tender guy he is who has suffered through some tough breaks. Why did the record company drop him anyway? And those sad girlfriends he portrays...why did they leave him and why were they sad? He reminded me of the Tom character from Robert Altman's ""Nashville""....a sick but poetic fellow who says (or writes) whatever he needs to in order to feed his insatiable ego."
1,Regurgitated Kerouac and Ginsburg,"If this guy talked about healing one more time I swear to god I would have jumped out a window. At one point in the book He ACTUALLY wrote (right out of ""On The Road"")- ""I think of DEAN MORIARITY"" and repeated the line three times -For young people who never read the Beats, this must be real revolutionary stuff. For me it just goes to show that anyone can write a book today. Here's the recipe for this book - regugatate Keroac and Ginsburg, add some over hyped ""REAL STREET EXPERIENCES"" and toss in some half baked California spirituality and you get Mr Montiels ""Memoir"". Have you ever had a halfwit who thinks they know everything there is to know about life give you advice? - Unless you want to know what that is like, save your money."
4,A New generation of writers,"It seems to me while the rest of the world has become one giant coorporate melting pot the one thing that has gone back to a grass roots movement is arts and literature. While there are endless run-ons, misspellings and over punctuation at every turn, I was moved. In the end that is what I look for art to do. Move me. This book did that. Well done. Loved the references to some of my boyhood heroes."
5,a damed good book,"god damit. I loved this book. I like the old New York. Better. Than the NEW new York. Mustach don't cut it. Nomore. Yeah, I like champagne. Blue light blue. Sunday brunch at two. Greased back, slicked back, all black LEATHER. Hey funny bird, cabbie on the street. Ohai, Lorie, and Lisa Marie. I love it all. New York City baby."
1,"Looks like Kerouac, but isn't","There are stretches of this book that sound like the writer ischanneling Jack Kerouac. In fact, sometimes the channeling is sofaithful that you could even mistake it for plagiarism. But this reallyisn't anything likeThe Dharma Bums (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition). Instead it's more a narcissistic, disjointed storyof a borderline sociopath (who may or may not be the author).The key is in the beginning pages when the author describes his hero'sadventures in Astoria. It's a record of meanness and violence that hasits echoes through the rest of the book.The movie, I'm told, has some promise, but you could do better to skip this little piece of drivel and tryOn The Road by Jack Kerouac Poster by Len Deighton, 24"" x 34""instead."
5,STOP making books movies!,"They ALWAY F it up! I love this book so much and if some film company screws with it I'll hunt and kill them down!!! BTW the author is the hottest white man alive (I, being a black woman)"
3,Good value !!,"Got the scale, inserted the batteries, tap and you are on. Takes a total of 5 minutes to do it all.Reason for 3 stars: Tapping is annoying feature; Why can't the scale turn on (reset to 0) and give me the reading when I stand on it? Instead, you have to tap it...and tap it correctly... you must apply little force and tap it in the right areas...annoying feature.Also once tapped, it takes about 3-5 seconds to reset to 0 and then you stand... gives you probably 3 seconds and if you don't stand it will turn off and then you tap again... Hmmmm !!I agree with other reviewers about its accuracy."
1,"Seller, not product","Stay away from this seller ""Salter"". I ordered this product 20 days ago and finally got an email saying that there's an unexpected delay! I cancelled right away, after waiting for almost a month!"
5,G.G.,We are very pleased with the Salter 926 Scale. The LCD readout is easy to read and accurate. The scale is sleek and very modern looking in appearance.
2,Salter 926 not as advertised,"I was really excited when I finally found a scale that said it would work on carpet. My husband had the same scale for 10 years and it finally gave out, but we had it in our closet.The Salter was not very steady on the carpet and you had to practially stomp on it to get it turned on.Very disappointing."
3,"Modern, but lacks Auto-Activation","The scale is very modern and the tempered glass is top quality. However, it is hard to activate the unit. You must tap FIRMLY on the glass to get it to turn on. Most electronic scale, all you have to do is stand on it and it would be self activating. Because of this activating issue, it can be very annoying when you are in a hurry. If it's looks, go for it. If it's for function, there are better one out there."
5,Great Accurate Smart scale,"Love this scale! Super accurate,easy to use. I'm on a weight reduction, muscle building program and this fit the bill perfectly. Highly recommend. Great price!"
4,Nice scale,"This replaced a large-mechanical-dial scale of ours. Looks very nice in the bathroom. Seems quite accurate [perhaps depressingly so]. But I agree with SK: that darn ""tap to activate"" is quite annoying. Other than that, it's well-priced and does what it says."
5,A Layman's Book for True Spiritual Growth,"Henry Guy has taken the subject of spirituality and brought it to a level that any intelligent person can understand. He is insightful, using great illustrations to show how the individual can be reponsible for the saving of humanity, and the world in which we live.So many of us live lives which do not seem to have much purpose, but Guy's book enables us to see that joyous living is a part of saving the world, along with harmlessness, right speech, and right human relations.If you want to have a life of purpose and joy, this book will be a great aid to getting there."
3,Good for homeschoolers or Moms,"These flashcards are a nice tool for sight words. I wish they included some kind of ring, so they could be flipped. They would also benefit from a little page of directions for teaching suggestions, games and activities. The box includes none of these. Also, I think there are too many sight words included. I really only wanted the Dolch sight words, but these include the Fry and Dolch words. They are printed on nice durable cardstock, with a nice, readable font. However the fun value is literally zero, so look around for something like Wrap Ups, or Flash Kids sight words. Maybe there is something slightly more creative. What I am doing is using a hole punch and a ring. If my son knows the word immediately we punch the card. After five punches the card is taken out and replaced with a new word. I plan to have a stack of about 20 going at a time. A friend gave me a metal ring to keep them on, but I don't know where one would buy a ring."
1,Would not buy again,"When I mounted these casters, the stem plate pushes down on the ball bearings and makes them unusable. I will buy better casters elsewhere. Wasted my money on these."
5,"Living their dreams, and mine too!","This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Ian and Sally are a young married couple who dreamed of leaving civilization and living in a cabin in the wilderness. It took them a year to gather the money and supplies needed, but eventually they made it to a lake in Northern British Columbia, Canada.The book is written from the journals they kept during their 14 month adventure. I was totally drawn into their lives as they described building a cabin and a food cache, the wildlife they lived among, the changing of the seasons, canoeing on the lake, the sounds and smells of the wilderness, and the aurora borealis at night.I just purchased their other two books (Arctic Adventures, and Wilderness Journey: Reliving the Adventures of Canada's Voyageurs) because I want to travel and explore with them."
2,Be warned,"The star rating is for the discs, not the music.This looks like a good value for money package - the 1968 ""Converge/Song Of The Wind"" session, plus the well-known Chick 'n Lionel MIDEM session (and a couple of surplus tracks that feature only the Hampton band).The trouble is - it may have been afflicted with a disc fault. One that causes a ""digital distortion"" whine/crackle to appear toward the end of both discs. My copy has this problem - and having tested another copy in my local secondhand shop, I'd assume they all do."
3,D.A.R.E. to read this,"I am giving Venom a 3 out of 5. Don't take this the wrong way, the condition of the product was much higher than anticipated and service was great. On the other hand I found the story to be uneventful and focused to highschool students with the hope of keeping them off drugs. Kinda lame. I was a little let down, honestly."
5,These Ladies Rock Blue,"Love their albums, love their music, love their voices, love the Blues.Love ""If I Should Die tonight"" the best."
3,"Cool, but ....","I am quite pleased with the filter. However, it does not sit in the lens as securely as I would have liked."
1,The Last Amateurs: Playing for Glory and Honor in Division I,"I was fooled once again by John Feinstein to waste money on another one of his books. The book was put togther poorly and really did a poor job of getting to the point, basketball!"
2,Feinstein is a good witer but is lazy and extremely biased.,As a college basketball fan I enjoyed some of the stories this book provided about the Patriot League but have serious issues with Feinsteins credibility. I will never read another one of his books. His bias angainst Georgetown University and anyone else who doesn't cater to his every whim makes me sick. The unprofessional way he handles himself on TV and Radio appearances is quite disturbing. I for one am sick of his biased garbage and extreme arrogance. He acts like everyone owes him something for being John Feinstein.
2,It's a mess!,"I stopped reading by page 70, with a headache. He introduces too many players, coaches, administrators, teams, all from present and past, and it's very difficult to remember who is who in all of it. It's like listening to someone who is talking at 75 MPH and didn't bother to plan his speech. I agree with some of the other reviewers who say he should have focused on just one team. Otherwise, he should have written this more carefully, more skillfully. The book reads like it was written in a hurry and given little editing. He jumps from one place to another, and from one person to another often from sentence to sentence. Very confusing. I read his book on Bobby Knight and the Hoosiers' championship season in 87/88, and I really liked it, so this book was a big disappointment."
5,Incredible,"I loved this book. The book is intended for the true Basketball aficianado, not a passing fan. You get a great peek at what life is like for some true Student-Athletes, and great insight into life on the road in the Patriot League. I did not attend one of these schools and was still riveted to the book."
2,Lehigh Alum,"I bought this book since I went to Lehigh and thought it would be extra interesting because of my background and because I played soccer and ice hockey at college. What a let-down!I found the game by game annayasis drawn out and boring. About the only thing I can recommend to you from the book is the ""amaterism"" ( if there is such a word) of college sports at Lehigh and the great majority of other colleges in the US that we do not read or hear about on a daily basis.I see you can purchase a used copy on Amazon for $0.99 - so what the hell - for a buck it's worth it I guess."
2,Bogged Down,I have read and enjoyed all the Fienstein books but this time I got bogged down. He should have just concentrated on a couple of teams. I got confused reading about the entire league.
1,A quack on the brink,"Those who are regular readers of Feinstein's Washington Post column will recognize the blatent and quite repetitive biases that plague the corpus of his work. I had difficulty wading through Feinstein's opinions to get to what should be the focus of the work, the student athletes. This book is not about the patriot league; it is about John Feinstein. If you have to read a book by him, read ""Season on the Brink,"" at least that was entertaining."
2,"Okay, but way too long","I agree with other reviewers who said that Feinstein would've been better off following one team instead of all of them. This could also chop the length down to a more reasonable amount. There's just too much going on to remember everything. I didn't even finish the book because it just took too long to get to the end and it didn't seem like the end would ever come. Feinstein could've told this story in about 250 pages instead of almost twice that. Not terrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
5,Last Amatuers A Must Have For High School Age BBall Fanatics,"In reading The Last Amatuers, I must say it has to be one of the best basketball based books I have ever read. I have read Season on The Brink, and Where The Game Matters Most, and this is by far the best one ever. It shows that academics MUST come before athletics, and that small schools dont always lose the guarantee games, and that the mid, and low major teams can run with the big dogs. I highly recommend it to high school basketball players who have a passion for in depth basketball readings."
3,The Future of Sport,"While reading through this book, I wondered why the author has a thing against Georgetown University. Georgetown is tied with Holy Cross of the author's exalted Patriot League in graduating athletes within five years. These are two of the top schools in this category. This makes Holy Cross and the Patriot League above reproach, while it subjugates the Hoyas to Feinstein's basement.Other than the above prejudices, Mr. Feinstein is a good writer, and the subject is a fascinating one. The question being, will this be the future of college athletics."
4,Great Book,"As a Lafayette grad (93), this book was well worth reading. John captures the essence of athletics at Lafayette. All the passion and integrity can be found in every sport at Lafayette. Fran O'Hanlon has done a wonderful job as coach and he strives to make the program about the kids, not boosters, tv, or money."
5,The Sports Page Came to Life !,"I have been used to seeing the names of Army, Colgate, Holy Cross, Navy and the other Patriot League schools in the compiled scores of the sports page, but I never knew their stories. I had no idea what they are trying to do in the Patriot League. Wow! This book was a refreshing change from everything else that I have ever seen written or heard about the sport. Read this book if you want to have your bias challenged, and learn about real student athletes. Leave it alone if you are happy with the current state of NCAA Division1 hoops, and don't want to think about what else is possible."
4,Big time sports,"Great look at basketball played by real student athletes, who go to school to graduate and play ball. Great human interest mixed with games played with heart and emotion. Fans will be greatly pleased with this work."
1,Overhyped and Sappy,Feinstein once again thinks the measure of good writing can be calculated by how much sap and melodrama he incorporates into an otherwise mundane story. About the only thing that shines through in the book is Whinestein's personal biases and alarmingly partial commentary. Is he a journalist or a propogandist?
1,More Feinstein Bias,"While the book's topic is a meritorious one, I always have a hard time getting by the author's bias. I have read several of his books and regularly see him in the Washington Post and hear him on the radio. He has a few hot buttons that he can't leave alone and where his one-sided views (good or bad) show no balance or understanding of the whole picture. Few things in this world are wholly good or bad -- Feinstein has yet to figure that out. The ACC is all good, Georgetown or John Thonpson all bad."
1,Amateur Journalism,"After years of trying to bash the big boys, Feinstein has finally moved down to the little leagues in a feebly transparent attempt to justify his previous efforts by cuddling up to the cozy, innocent world of amateur basketball. This book just does not make the cut, much like the players and teams featured therein do not make the cut in major callege basketball. During Feinstein's so-called career as a sports commentator, both in print and on the airwaves, he has developed a unique style that is a particularly obnoxious blend of Harvey Fierstein and Jerry Springer. His personal biases are so painfully transparent that mentioning Feinstein and journalistic integrity in the same breath is an open invitation to an oxymoron. The only positive comment that can be made about this book is that amateur journalism and amateur basketball have finally met. Amateur basketball scrapes out the win in double overtime."
1,Lost in another era,"Feinstein just doesn't get it and seems to always ask ""wonder why? and make out big time basketball as some villan, but he makes all his money out of this.....I just read an article in the Post and he brings up the same junk he did 20 years ago......Send this guy packing.... don't buy his book as his pompous arguements have never stood up...."
2,The Lamorna Wink,"This is one of the weaker Grimes novels. The emphasis on Melrose Plant was exelllent as was the fleshing out of most of the major characters but the plot was badly resolved and detailed. The usual Aunt Agatha and Long Pid characters were comic if getting a bit tiresome, but the tone was completely at odds with the main plot. Snuff movies, Count Drac and IRA snippets make for an unconvincing mix. She really shouldn't take such serious topics as pedophila and AIDS and bracket them will almost slapstick humor."
3,Too horrific; too little outrage,"I'm a lover of Grimes' Jury series and had hiked extensively in Cornwall before reading the book. Naturally I was thrilled to find this book about all the fascinating little towns, such as Mousehole (""mow'zul"") we had visited along the coastal paths, and couldn't wait to send it to my hiking friend. But the total callousness and horror of the crime was just too much; I never sent it to her. Of course we're inundated with disgusting, obscene real crimes these days, but I have to agree with another reader that there was not sufficient horror and outrage expressed in the book."
1,Has Ms. Grimes ever actually been to England?,"I ask because no-one in England misspells ""Provo"", ""Weetabix"", or says ""nine-fifty"" when they mean ten-to-ten; there were lots more Americanisms, but those were the worst.Those nitpicks aside, this is by far the worst book I have read this year, despite it coming fairly highly recommended. Utterly, utterly dire characterisation. These characters are so wooden they'd give Pinnochio a run for his money. And the ""plot"" is just laughable, despite Ms. Grimes dismal attempt to spice things up with a little snuff.Want a good ""cozy"" detective story? Try any of the late great Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer series. Or if you're looking for it to be set in England, even Sarah Caudwell's far wittier Hilary Tamar series..."
1,"THE WORST!!! Vapid plot, flat characters, waste of time","Grimes has combined several ""modern"" themes such as Aids and spun a truly irresponsible and vapid plot. The characters are flat in this one too. Instead of trying to stay modern with artificial plot and character changes, Grimes should stick to what she knows best. This books is dreadful...it's going straight into the bin. THE WORST!!"
1,No thanks,"This is my first and last Martha Grimes. I read detective novels for entertainment. I find NOTHING entertaining about murdered children, especially the way she sets it. As an author figuring on best-selling lists, I think the author has a responsability towards readers to not make certain things acceptable, to not de-sensitize us by casually writing about certain unspeakable crimes. There is no retribution to the bad guys, nothing cheerful we can hold on to. There's a vague sense of humour but the last bit about her usual excentric characters is totally out of place and simply doesn't belong there. We simply couldn't care less. As a mother, there are certain things I don't want to think about out nor read about, certain notions I don't want spread nor tolerated. Martha Grimes, I am NOT impressed."
3,Caution for the soft hearted or mothers.,"I am a great fan of Martha Grimes. Between books, I miss the characters. The Lamorna Wink was well written, no doubt about it. Her characters are so real, I've come to be quite fond of them. But as a Mom, I found the subject matter disturbing. So if you're a mom or sensitive to children in distress stories, re-think this book and wait for the next one. What I really did enjoy about this book was a closer look at Melrose Plant. He's quite delightful; however, I miss Jury. I hope she writes another one soon."
2,Shocking,"I was a great fan of Martha Grimes until this book. The use of the children not only had no point in the story but was upsetting, disturbing and not necessary. In fact I put the book aside after Macalvie viewed the video. I don't know how an author who showed such empathy in her other novels would write one with such a tasteless overtone as in this one."
1,Grim Grimes,"I received ""The Case Has Altered"" for Christmas and enjoyed it immensely, so I immediately went out and purchased ""The Lamorna Wink."" Big mistake. Obviously this is usually an enjoyable and entertaining series. But not this time. The focus on child snuff films constitutes an ugly error in judgement. What did Grimes think she was doing? She provides her readers with not one, not two, but three graphic descriptions of young children being tortured and murdered. We get the usual whimsical Plant/Jury shenanigans, but mated to material that is distressing in the extreme. Where is the fun in that? If a writer has to stoop this low for a plot, or is unable to judge just how inappropriate the plot is in relation to her own characters, perhaps it is time for her to move on to another line of work."
1,It&#65533;s a mistake,"How could the writer make such a mistake as to misattribute the classic Dover beach by Matthew Arnold to another poet. What happened to the editor? The strange handling of the death of children was offensive. The ingénue character has somehow remained a very young woman despite the passing years and incongruously has forgotten about record players, which she used in earlier books - duh! The mystery of this book is why it was published?"
2,Plot problem,"I have enjoyed earlier Richard Jury mysteries, but I found this one a great disappointment. Has no one else noticed an enormous hole in the plot -- a problem with chronology? I am not going to spoil the book for those who have not read it, but I am curious to see if anyone else spotted this, or if I'm missing something. And the sub-plot was simply tiresome. It is time to marry off that dreary Vivian and get her out of the books."
2,Good story comes to bad end,"I wonder what Grimes was thinking as she finished this novel. She takes a delightful amateur detective story and spoils it with a graphic account of a sadistic child murder. In the final chapters, she mixes scenes of unbearable cruelty with local pub amusements that are not funny in the context of the tragedy we are reading about, and add nothing to the story. Richard Jury shows up only long enough to lose interest in all the plots and subplots. And after being actively involved in the entire mystery, Melrose departs the scene before it is unconvincingly resolved with one of the perpetrators in the sadistic murders going unpursued."
4,"A strong Jury novel, albeit with ""little"" Jury","I thoroughly enjoyed the latest of the Martha Grimes ""Richard Jury"" series, in spite of Jury's near absence in the book. Melrose plant figures strongly and there is just the right mix of the usual Long Pidd characters. Strange (nearly gratuitous) plot twist at the end in the continuing saga of VivViv and the Count.... I suppose it's the ""cliff hanger"" type of thing that makes you wonder what is coming in the next book. Anyway, enjoyable reading in spite of the rather ""dark"" solution to the disappearance of the two children. Overall, it's one of the better of this series."
2,A weak plot,"This is my second Richard Jury book and I find it disappointing. Off to an interesting and richly characterized start the grand ""mystery"" depends on an utterly absurd (not to mention distasteful) event awkwardly inserted into the plot almost as an afterthought. I don't recommend this book even for Jury fans - Jury himself doesn't enter the fray until almost the bitter end."
4,Read in conjunction with Lynch's Mulholland Drive.,"A delicious, witty, immensely entertaining and amusing overview of the famous and talented of Hollywood. The photos are absolutely delightful as I imagine they would be by Edward Steichen,Herb Ritts, Irving Penn and (especially) Annie Leibovitz among (many) others. The photos seem to capture the nature of the subjects - Brando so anti glamour, Anjelica Huston so assertive, and Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon on the closing page, half naked and in drag, so so ... they're just great subjects/actors. The illustrations are also great as is the prose by Dorothy Parker, P.G. Wodehouse and others. The only disappointment is that in paperback the binding is so fragile that the weight of the pages pulls the book to pieces. My copy has broken completely away from the covers, and not from any rough handling. In hardcover this is a five star enterprise, perhaps one of the best I have seen considering the thousands of books that are associated with that place."
2,Not enough of the old stuff,"While there were some great vintage articles and photographs, why are pages blown to show wastes like Gwyneth Paltrow, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt, and other I-make -money- because- of- my- looks and not acting ability ""artists?"" Many obscure silent and early talking stars could've and SHOULD'VE been included. But that's the way it is- nobody cares for the old. Makes a great coffee table book. Get this from the library. I was disappointed. I was done with it in one afternoon."
1,This book is a major disappointment,"The only way anyone would give this book more than 1 star is if they are a close friend of Snepp. The rest of the world wouldn't read it. How can a book be about so important a topic, get banned, taken to the Supreme Court, and remain so forgotten? Because the book sucks, it is pedantic, overwritten, and all about what a superspy Frank is. Most controversial books sell, even if they are crappy. This book is so crappy that it doesn't even sell, and thus it will remain a footnote to history."
4,PGP (Pretty Good Portrayal),"One man's story sandwiched into a lot of facts/astute observation. Since I was only 11 at the time, it filled in a good number of gaps. Yes, cooks cover their mistakes with spices, doctors with earth, and the CIA with lots of duct tape tape, boundings, and gag orders. And, worse, they never learn fully, blundering again and again (just a guess). Such is life and the public's general willingness, in my life opinion, and this book fills a very important niche in that.This book can be a little hard to grind through, and that give it 'only' 4 stars, as the reading public demands to be favorably entertained -- so a more difficult book by a small margin will be mostly preaching to the choir (the already converted or few read-a-holics as well I guess in this case)."
4,As advertised,"Product as advertised. Shipped in reasonable time. I""m pleased with the purchase. The book was also a great insight into the history of the end S. VietNam."
4,Necessary read on the US failure in Indochine,"Frank Snepp's incisive view of the American embassy in the closing months of the Vietnamese war speaks volumes. The lessons of the failure of the intelligence community and upper levels of the military command are stunning, valid, and instructive today.The failed attempt at stopping the distribution of this book was for one reason only - to keep the contents from the American public's view. A bit like Nixon's secret bombing of Cambodia. No secret to the Cambodians on the ground, just from the American people, albeit for not long. No, this book is an essential read for all students of the Vietnamese era, and the reason the Vietnamese people won their freedom."
2,Not a good choice,This piece had several problems. It cracked easily during normal use due to thermal shock. The cheese and sauce burned on and is difficult to remove. I have a normal size oven and this is a bit too small in width. The pizza cutter is also junky. It would be better to buy a better one separately.I replaced this stone with a set of unfinished clay tiles from the hardware store (one whole one and one cracked in half that do a much better job of crisping the pizza because they hold more heat and yet they haven't cracked under heavier usage.
2,Cracked after 2nd use,"I bought this to use with the Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes book.The first time we make one loaf of bread and some bagels. No problems.The second time we made two batches of bread and cooked them all over the course of three hours or so. When we turned off the stove and let everything cool to room temperature with the door closed. When we opened the door several hours later, the stone was cracked into two irregular pieces. It's is still usable, but not practical to store or move into and out of a stove easily.We will be looking for a better stone."
1,"doesn't crisp, what am I doing wrong?","I bake frozen pizza and reheat store-bought pre-baked baguettes on this stone, not only does it not crisp the bread/crust up better than a ""naked"" oven rack, it actually makes it stay soft! I must be doing something wrong, although I follow the instructions. I preheat the stone before I put the pizza or bread on as instructed. I don't wash it much so it will keep its oil as instructed. I definitely don't use soap. Everytime I used the stone, I end up getting soft crust! I have to then move the super hot, heavy stone out of the way so I can rebake the pizza/bread on a naked oven rack to crisp it up. I keep trying over and over because everyone loves pizza stones so much, but I think I'm going to give up and throw it out. What am I doing wrong?!!"
1,broken,"this item was packaged by? I don't see how it could have made it to memuch less to the dilevery person in in all the peices I got it in.there was one air bag folded over it inside, was sand by the time I receved.sence it was cheep & not wanting to waste hours of my time I neglectedto return it. but it was a good lesson learned! if you want sand go to the beach."
1,Dirty & Smokey,"Oil from frozen pizza embeds and burns in to the pan. Can't wash/soak it out. You can burn it out, but causes alot of smoke and the pan still looks nasty. Maybe the real stone works better? I definitely cannot recommend this one!"
4,Exactly as pictured.,"These toothbrushes arrived quickly and exactly like the picture. I am giving it only 4 stars because unfortunately I don't like this new model as much as the previous Advantage toothbrushes. The bristles have changed (previously they were longer on the sides and shorter in the middle of the head -- now they are the same length from side to side, but have a zigzag short then long pattern from bottom to top.) And the blue rubber on the back of the toothbrush head adds a lot of bulk. The handle is still the same trim shape, which I like."
2,Very disappointing!!,"I read in Cook's Illustrated magazine that this timer was *the* timer to buy, but I am very disappointed in the product. I gave it two stars instead of one because the dual-timer function is great...but other than that, I don't have anything else positive to say about it.The biggest detractor is that the alarm is VERY quiet...so if you're more than a few feet away from it, you'll likely not hear it go off. You can wear it on your waistband, but who wants to do that?I'm likely to throw it out and replace it with something else. Don't buy this product!"
3,Hard to hear,"Has all sorts of great features but I have a hard time hearing it. Probably a personal problem. Works great if I hear it, if not things are over done."
3,Magnet falls off back of this timer,The timer works fine but the magnet that is supposed to hold it to the stove came unglued right away.
2,"Nice, but has problems","I love that you can set this timer for two separate things at once and I also really like that you can see both times at once. Switching between times on other timers can be difficult with messy hands. But the display is nice and big and easily readable.I wish it had one or two more times you could set simultaneously. But the biggest problem I have with this timer is that if I leave the room, I can't hear it, even if the exhaust fan is off, so I have to take the timer with me when I leave the room and sometimes I forget to bring it back in with me and I lose it.Otherwise, it's a fine, user-friendly timer."
2,OK Product,Good performance as a timer.Easy to read and use.Do NOT put this on your fridge .. it WILL fall off and break.Use it as a desk timer or use the small loop to hang it.DO NOT TRUST the magnets to hold it to your fridge.
1,can't hear it,The alarm is so quiet you have to have it next to you in a quiet room to hear it beep. Defeats the purpose of having a timer doesn't it?
1,Piece of junk,It was not only a problem that you had to bring the timer with you so that you would hear it. We were warned about that. We put it on the frig to get it out of the way when not in use until the magnet part came loose. It worked for about a month & then quit. The company has not responded to the email that was written about the quality or lack thereof of the timer. I hope it will let me put no stars but may have to get 1 to get it to register my review.
1,Polder Poor,"Very disappointed. The product arrived somewhat disassembled but when I tried to reach the company to get directions on putting it together, I never got a response to several calls and messages left on their answering machine. Piss Poor customer relations. I'll not buy Polder again."
2,difficult,Kind of difficult to work. The ideam will refuse to set and gets jamed into the second time. also the lower timer does not register the far rt side display. It is missing one side.
3,Alarm too quiet,I like this timer other than the volume of the alarm/beeper being too low. I could barely hear the alarm when I was two rooms away--and I'm in a small house.
1,Poorly Constructed,"Magnet fell out the first week, directions are poorly written, waiting for it to self destruct so I can buy another brand"
1,Can't see the numbers,"I am so disappointed. I have an old version of this timer and love it, it's been working great for years. I got this one to have as a second. It has a plastic scratch cover over the front when it arrives (like most new things do). When I removed it, it came off fine, but after a few days, the face of the timer was etched everywhere the scratch prevention cover had been touching it. I can even see the small bubbles where it didn't seal all the way. The entire clear face now looks like etched glass. I tried cleaning it in case it was left over adhesive, it isn't, it is permanently marked and I can barely see the numbers unless I hold it under a bright light."
1,Cheap - but still...,"Read the microspically printed manual and do a few test runs before trying to use this device in practical cooking situation.Why did Polder feel compelled to come up with a better mousetrap instead of an easy to use, dependable kitchen timer?Oh yeah...the magnet already fell off, and I have owned this timer less that 60 days... It has the distinction of having made it to our kitchen's useless utensil drawer faster than any other.The geeks on America's Test Kitchen ought to be ashamed of themseleves for naming this their best pick."
1,Dead On Arrival,"Althought this timer comes highly rated... It was dead out of the box. Of coarse there was no problem returning it. I'm starting to question these cheaply made electronic devices, mass produced and sold as quality items. I have seen alot of this type of junk lately. I'm still looking for a timer."
3,A Lot of the Same Old,"The three men's voices are very good, though of popular rather than operatic caliber, and they sing with great enthusiasm, notwithstanding some flatness of pitch at times (e.g., during ""Volare""). The repertoire on this CD is nothing new (except perhaps for the Italian version of ""La Danza"" which is probably the best track); they could have been more original, which would have enhanced the overall quality of the recording. The arrangement of ""O Surdato 'nnammurato"" is peculiar (to my ear) and spoiled what is one of my favorite popular Italian songs.I wouldn't mind hearing more from this trio but would appreciate some originality of repertoire."
1,not what I'd hoped for,I was hoping this group would sound more like Il Divo or Amici Forever.This is not operatic quality.
3,Reset the monitor,"Initially this worked fine out of the box - it gave the same readings that my doctor's office got. After about a dozen readings on different days, the readings climbed higher. Of course I got concerned and got my readings at the doctor's office again - my bp was unchanged but the monitor was off by 20 points on the systolic. After few more days of different readings it was off by 40 points. I was going to throw the thing away, than thought of taking out the batteries and putting them in again - and Presto! Accurate readings again. Because of wrong readings that it gave and the lack of a recalibration on this, I only give it three stars. If you are having problems with this, Reboot the thing by taking out the batteries and putting them in again."
5,SO EASY TO USE,"JUST GOT THIS A FEW WEEKS AGO AND COMPARED TO THE OLD BLOOD PRESSURE MONITERS, THIS IS SO EASY TO USE AND READ.. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU HAVE TO WATCH YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE"
2,Easy to Use But Lowsy Measurements,Bought this unit when I developed high blood pressure to take daily readings. Started to get concerned when readings were still really high so I took it to my doctor's office for calibration. It was off by almost 30 points on the high number and 14 points on the low number.
4,Very handy!,This product has been very helpful in a pinch. Using it for family and friends when check blood pressure. It has been pretty accurate when used properly. I would recommend this as device to others as a first response and then follow up with your physician.
3,Nice programmer with some good ideas,"BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER was made because some buildings in a Texas State Fair were available and looked futuristic enough to use in a film. That statement alone guarantees a low budget. Despite that, the film is fun--a good performance from Robert Clark holds it all together and, in the 60's, it looked really good.The disk itself is of indifferent quality. Dark, scratchy in places, it would be nice to see a restored version but, for now and at the low price this disk commands, it's a nice item to pick up for a casual watch."
4,time barrier,"i like the movie ,it shows old cars and old scenery and old actors and science in it, i cant see voteing this a five star its barely a four star."
3,ITS WEIRD,"i got this movie because of the cover. its strange. weird. if you like old sci-fi, its ok, but just a strange movie. bad sets, bad acting"
2,Beyond the Time Barrier,"Forgot how cheesey this low budget movie really was. The last time i saw this movie I was 12, and I think twice in a lifetimeis more then enough."
1,Little in Way of Redemption,"There are ""B"" Sci Fi movies that are basically wretched but, somehow, manage to be funny and endearing at the same time. ""Beyond the Time Barrier"" is not one of those; it's simply wretched.The only redeeming qualities are a brief glimpse at the state of American air power in 1959 and the scene where the deaf-mute daughter is introduced by her father. Without looking at the father, the daughter smiles and turns to him as he introduces her !! Now that was funny."
1,Don't Bother,"Really a piece of crap. I love a bad movie; this is not a ""bad"" movie. Also not shot at the Texas State Fair Grounds."
4,Nice Low-Budget Sci-Fi,"Made in 1960, Beyond the Time Barrier offers better ideas than most sci-fi movies up to that point. Even though it's obviously a low-budget film, the premise is more plausible and the acting is good. The prison break/riot sequence is also very good.A similar movie from 1956 was World Without End (which isn't as good).Rent it.[DW]"
3,I've Seen Worse,"I first found this on Netflix streaming video. I liked it well enough to order the DVD from Amazon. That ought to say something. It's not a classic - I'd never heard of it before Netflix - but it's somewhat entertaining. That's all I ask from a movie. It's one of those films that don't stress the brain so you can watch it while getting drowsy in the recliner. I'd like to know where they filmed it. The upside-down triangle architecture throughout the ""underground city"" is pretty cool."
3,A little Gem here.......,"In the 60's / early 70's when i did see this movie, there were so many tarzan andgangsters movies that when a science fiction came out we made sure to get the frontrows. Like most science fiction from those days...they had barely any budgets forspecial effects and other goodies. The stories were good, but most movies did notfare too good.I call them science fiction gold...as every movie had a bit of good in there, could have been the clothes they wore, or the old cars they were using or wasit those visible wires to hold the space ships. Anyway, take the movie with agrain of salt and you should enjoy it."
2,owners experience,Book was in great condition..but unfortunately it did not come with the accompanying cd ! It's virtually impossible to simulate all these algorithms without the applets(on the cd!).
1,Truly Awful,"I teach a Data Structures course and this book was thrust upon me by previous instructors. Book is full of code: much of it very poorly written...I censored much of it before showing to students. Some code I left as is to show them examples of bad programming practices. The little ""analysis"" contained in the book is misleading and sometimes wrong. The lack of rigor is appalling. Maybe a good choice for high-school students, otherwise avoid this book!"
5,Excellent Introduction,This book presents an excellent introduction to Data Structures using Java.The workshop applets are really helpful to get quick understanding.
2,"Good, but incomplete","I HATE books that tell you they cover certain subjects and then leave things ""as an exercise for the reader."" I think it's a cop out. Either cover the subject or not; but don't do a [poor] job. This book, although good, does that ""exercise"" thing. It devotes a whole chapter to describing Red-Black Trees, and then doesn't even provide an algorithm, but leaves it up to the reader to look in the references for a book that covers the algorithm or code. It does the same for B-Trees.As I said, the book is good, but that ""exercise"" thing is a big hot button for me. I would rather have the author just say that there are other data structures called such-and-such that may be better for certain use but they're outside the scope of the book.If you're an absolute beginner (as I am), and don't mind a $50 book teasing you and then telling you to buy another $50 for the complete answer, go ahead and buy this one."
5,Excellent resource for CS/CSE Students,"Not only is the text clear and concise, but unlike too many other java books, the author stays away from customized classes. Most of the examples in the book can be compiled with any java compiler without finding some proprietary ""helper"" clases. If you are a student who wants a better understanding and a good hand on those programming assignments, look no further; this is the book you want."
1,Bad picture quality,I originally thought that my system was the reason for the bad picture quality. I proceeded to clean the entire system meticulously with alcohol. This process took me about 4this hours because i ordered a used sega from ebay and it was really nasty. Then I hooked everything back up and I still had bad picture quality. I decided to order another cable as a last resort for the system and it was like magic. Now I have great picture quality. I would recommend a genesis cable with a/v end instead of the rf adapter. I even tried hooking the system up on a tube tv with the new rf switch and it still had horrible picture quality.
1,NEVER EVEN RECEIVED THE PRODUCT AFTER PAYING FOR IT!!!!,NEVER EVEN RECEIVED THE PRODUCT AFTER PAYING FOR IT!!!!RIP OFF GALORE!!!
4,Explore your true self and intuition when stuck in a rut.,"I never liked journaling and found no use for it, except feeling stupid and having nothing that seemed significant to write about. THIS BOOK turns THE NON-JOURNALER INTO A WRITER by helping you work through your feelings with prompts and ideas that really make you think. After just 8 days into the 40 I made some major realizations and had to stop myself from rushing through it. But the main idea of the book is to help you to slow down and listen to yourself."
4,Great gift for self and friend,"I purchased this book as a gift for a friend whose birthday is just a few days after my own. I bought one for myself as well, and we agreed work on it at the same time in order to inspire each other to stick to it. It's a great idea, and a nice gift for those who don't normally journal. (I do, but she doesn't.) The process of completing the book gave us something to talk about."
4,Can't go wrong with a Bach,"This is a good mouthpiece, it has a nice even tone and fares particularly well in the upper register. Bach mouthpieces are made with the simplest designs that can accomodate developing musicians such as myself. I play euphonium and it does a pretty good job, but I prefer a darker tone, so I use my 5GB most of the time, and use the 6-1/2A for baritone. I enjoy playing on this mouthpiece and I could not have purchased a better one."
1,A BAD LIGHT for the GBA,"I was looking forward to this light that Nintendo developed, until I received it. Yes, it is a light, but it DOES NOT light up your GameboyAdvance.It cast a light on the surface of your GBA, but doesn't light up the screen. Don't waste your money on this light."
3,IF I KNOW WHAT IT IS...,Magnification Level: 1.2XLight: OKRecommendation: I think you should get the new Sunsebu Imported LightBoy!
4,I'm an astrologer....,"...and was impressed by this book. Don't get me wrong, it didn't change my position that astrology is ""true"" even a little bit. However, this is the only anti-astrology work that didn't infuriate me with assuming, pompous authors. Their well researched arguments and sincere approach earned my respect and are among the best out there. You will get a plethora of additional value from this also, if you are a layman lover of science. But, yes, I'm still an ardent supporter of astrology. This book is a resource that lets me fight back against the best. Though many will be tempted to accept it as such, this book is not the last word on the subject."
1,The premise is bad,"This is not really a review, but a reaction to the title of the book. Shall we look forward to a series with titles like: Arithmetic, True or False; Religion, True or False; Psychology, True or False?"
5,A Son's Homage to His Dad,"This very short book is an affectionate retelling of a father's bicycle trip across the country in 1923. Starting in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and ending in Los Angeles, the narrative follows the young Frank Kolbe as he sets out to see the world for the first time. The simple, straight-forward writing reflects the author's sincere desire to elevate the memory of his father and his adventures. Light reading, but fun."
2,not your best choice for a cookie,these cookies are very hard and almost impossible to soften in milk. by accident the bag was left unsealed and in a day or two the cookies softened and tasted much better
3,Mi Del Double chocolate Sandwich Cookies,"Mi-Del Gluten-Free Double Chocolate Sandwich Cookies, 8-Ounce Bag (Pack of 12)I recently ordered these cookies and was pleasantly surprised how good they were. I enjoyed them for three straight days in a row. On the second day I started feeling bad, the third day worse, then I read the label and low and behold these ""Gluten Free"" Cookies are made in a factory that also produces wheat products! Couldnt believe it! How they can call this product gluten free when they also produce wheat products is beyond me. I mean really, how can they get every wheat spore out of the air and completely off the production line. If you are truly Celiac beware of this product and others from this company. It is 5 days later and am finally starting to feel better. I am assuming that a co. rep will read these reviews so thanks for your misleading labeling you morons! It should be refered to as ""Gluten Friendly"""
2,"Grind them up for an ice cream treat, but don't snack on these puppies","It may be unfair, but I have had Kinnikinnick KToos, their gluten free oreo style cookie previously, and I loved them. yummy, addicting, they really did call for a glass of milk and the whole swirling ritual associated with the name brand goodies. So, I had a pretty good impression of oreo style GF cookies, and I was excited to try these. Unfortunately they were nothing like I was hoping. They are hard and almost dusty, and neither the cookie nor the filling actually tastes good by itself. I honestly think they'd be fine in a recipe, for a dairy queen style oreo shake or those mysterious desserts involving cool whip, but I just can't eat them on their own. They don't taste good- and it's not 'cause i'm not used to GF stuff! After 27 years I ought to be. ;)"
3,ok but filling inside just as hard as the outside,"These were bought for my 6 year old autistic son. These are a little similar to the kinnitoos, but the filling inside is so dark my son at first didn't know there was any cream in the middle. Also the filling seems just as hard as the cookie itself. The cookie itself is not bad tasting. These are better for adults with a cup of coffee. It was a great price."
4,That was cool!,I really liked the extension because my t.v is really far away from my bed and now I can sit on my bed and play.
3,Can't Hit Deepest Bass,There's a lot of cheap 2.1 speakers today that can hit the lowest frequency except this speaker system.Try to play the song Lying From You by Linkin Park. You should hear the bass frequency from 6 to 7 seconds but it's not coming out with this subwoofer.
1,So What's New?,"Would like to review this product, but after nearly two months I still have not received it, despite a re-order. Thus, I am NOT satisfied with the product."
4,Good to Know - How to Use,"Joel DeLuca's book on Political Savvy gave me pause for thought and reconsideration on the topic of organization politics. The book provides valuable insight into human behavior and suggestions on how to effectively harness it as a tool in your kit. While it all makes sense, and is good to know, the logistics of applying the knowledge in reality will prove challenging. Good stuff, worth the quick read."
4,A Magician's Must Have,"I have my first copy of this book shortly after its first printing in the 1970s. Travel and incident resulted in that book leaving my life but I'm grateful to now have a replacement, albeit, free of the various signatures my first book knew."
4,HELP!,"ATTENTION! The track listing is not given. Please tell me what the bonus tracks are! DIMMU IS AWESOME! GET ALL THEY HAVE! I have this album in a non-import version. It is an E.P. with I think 3 new [at that time] songs, 1 cover[accept's metal heart awesomely redone] and 3 live songs. And of course Raabjorn speiler.....They put that song on like every album! But it's great. But I can't tell you about the 2 bonus songs because I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE!"
1,still have not received,this was ordered in the beginning of October for my daughter's birthday. It's several weeks later and we are past the estimated delivery date. We still do not have the product.
1,Snow white and the seven dwarfs DVD,"Terrible, got this as a Christmas gift. Nothing better then getting a very scratched disc that didnt work in the 4 different machines we tried it in. Will never buy off amazon again"
1,NEVER RECEIVED DVD,"NEVER RECEIVED MY DVD, I HAVE SENT FOUR EMAILS TO THE SELLER WITH NO REPLY.. I WANT A REFUND OR MY DVD... I AM NOT HAPPY AND I WILL NEVER ORDER THROUGH AMAZON AGAIN, IF YOU KNOW WHY I NEVER GOT DVD PLEASE LET ME KNOW..."
1,Refund,I place an order back on Dec 11th and I have not receive my dvd yet I wil not be ordering anything else from lola teacher I have tried contactiong her twice by email still no response I advise anyone not to purchase anything from her.
2,Not....,good...dried out the skin within a couple of days with all of the alcohols.How do you think they make it sooo matte???!! If you have oily/sensitive skin just be careful
5,Best Ever Sunscreen for the face and body.,"This is an awesome product. Not greasy. Not pore clogging. Mat finish while keeping your skin hydrated and protected, I use it everyday. So awesome . . . you can use it on your face."
5,Yet Another Time Around,"I've read the whole series before, with the college series, diary, departures, blah blah, every one. But this girl borrowed a Whiper and a Wish so now I have to rebuy it, I'm rereading the series. If you want to know how good they are, I started rereading two days ago and I'm threee and a hlaf books in so far. You should all read these books, seriously."
4,Whisper and a Wish!,"My friend and I have read all the Christy books and we are addicted. A Whisper and a Wish was a great book, although not our favorite. If you've only read up to this book, and your not hooked....just wait! As you read more of the books, you will fall in love with the characters...becasue they just keep getting better as the books go on."
5,"Great characters, great tension.","It's nice to read a suspence/thriller where the ""bad guy"" isn't a cardboard cut-out boogie man. Stanton has a real ability to breathe life into his characters. Both protagonist and antagonist are filled with the strengths and emotional scars that really produce personalities, so that both become human beings, alive, with real feelings, motives, and emotions. Neither are left as mindless, cheap two-dimensional caricatures. It's also nice to see social commentary that is poignant and yet subtle. There are truths about our collective social past that aren't pretty, and Stanton has a way of dealing with these, exposing them, but without beating the reader over the head with them or preaching. The book suceeds on all levels - realistic characters with real lives, social issues that are more than superficially dealt with, and a plot that keeps the reader hanging till the end."
4,Eddhed,This book is relly good! It is written by my english teacher and i think that he is a really talented author!!!! Good Job BOB!!!!
5,Some real Hip Hop from the WEST COAST!!!,"This an album that has self scientific featuring artists like Phil Da Agony, Planet Asia, and Krondon. I love the album, but the songs on the back of the album dont match the way they are on the CD. For example the song ""Shame on a Ni**a"" from Talib Kweli is on there, but it does not say that on the album. LONG LIVE THE SELF SCIENCE!!!"
3,Alot of little logs,"We bought this set hoping to get more of the longer logs (my son wanted to build larger buildings)...it had 94 of the little logs. A waste of the money to get a whole lot more of what we didn't need. He only got 4 large logs. He'll still play with it for hours, so I give it 3 stars, but wasn't what we wanted."
4,Grandson's Christmas,"3 year old grandson REALLY enjoys building this, particularly with his dad. He can put his mechanical aptitude to work."
4,We need more of these,"This is almost a good book. It was consciously modeled after Claudio Magris' ""Danube"". There is a good bit of quoting from novels and third-rate poetry. She misses a number of important things like the tar sands, the Saskatchewan River delta and the exact location of the forest-prairie boundary. Despite its title it includes the Saskatchewan proper between the Forks and Lake Winnipeg. That said, the basic idea is good. Regional studies that mix geography and history with some literature and tourism are always valuable. Recommended to anyone who wants to understand or visit the Prairie Provinces."
4,I like it!!!!!,I recently bought a Mad Catz ripoff of this and it works perfect in low light (and no light at all for that matter...)The magnifier make the screen more detailed for seeing those little details that could save an extra life.
1,A BAD LIGHT for the GBA,"I was really looking forward to Nintendo's answer for a GBA light. Yes, it is a light, BUT it DOES NOT light up the screen.It lights up the surface of your GBA, but the screen is still dark with it turned on. You WON'T be happy with this light. Think twice before buying this light, you could loose the shipping cost when you want to return it."
2,Magnifier ???,"Ok, so the light illuminates marginally, but it runs down the batteries REAL fast. As far as the magnifier goes, I sat and compared with and without the magnifier for about 10 minutes and couldn't see one iota worth of difference. I haven't seen any of the others out there, so I can't compare. I wasn't too impressed and am glad this was a gift as opposed to a purchase."
1,Not worth the $... I paid!!!,I am hoping that I can find a better light for my system. In theory it's an excellent idea. But I find it's more of a problem than a solution. I will keep looking.
1,What a JOKE!,"This movie is HORRIBLE. The acting is lacking and even die-hard Meagan Good fans will be disappointed. Save your money and rent it at Redbox if you absolutely must see it. Otherwise, skip it. In my opinion, it is not even worth the Redbox charge of 1.28!"
3,Cliche' to the Max,"The story of a good girl gone bad...heard it all before! The acting is acceptable but the storyline is played and fails to offer much more than the usually. However, it does show that there's light at the end of the tunnel; you just have to get there."
1,Replacement for toilet paper?,"I watched this movie thinking it might be a Honey knockoff and probably not that great but I like movie that show decent dancers. I was thoroughly disappointed. Not only does this movie have crappy dialogue, no story arc, but it's so poorly shot that it could have been shot by a high schooler. The part where they shoot a music video in front of a green screen made me want to throw my remote at the tv. It was so poorly lit that you could see artifacting on Meagan Good. So if you want to buy a movie that isn't even good enough to wipe your ass with then Video Girl is right for you! One star because you can't go any lower."
3,Ok movie. I would watch it again,"Thats her real sister in real life. She was apart of the r n b group called Isyss (intelligent, sexy, young, soul sisters). It was a good movie with a great theme to it."
3,Typical Hollywood depiction...,"Meagan Good performance was exceptional as a young timid girl from a small neighborhood find her way through the urban music industry in Hollywood.The quality of the movie was great, though the film felt a bit rushed but what is there to express through film of what we already know about ""video girls?""Angel Lola Luv, Lisa Raye, Melissa Ford, Suelyn, and Esther Baxter...the Hip Hop Video model heavyweights blessed this film and validated the title of this film.So that's it really."
4,Not Bad....,It could have been worse. But it wasnt that bad. What can you expect? Its about a video girl! duh lol Not much of a plot but it is a little interesting if you are trying to break into that type of business. You get to understand the ups and downs.
2,It's just OK,"I'm a big Meagan Good fan and I think Adam Senn is cute. So that was pretty much my only motivation for watching this movie. But it's not bad, has a good message, and is enjoyable somewhat (not boring).Pros of movie: Meagan Good is beautiful. Adam Senn is beautiful. We get to see two beautiful people in a romantic storyline.Cons of movie: Low budget, the acting is not so good. The music is annoying. And the ending is predictable."
5,a very interesting movie,i've been waiting for this movie to comeout since forever and when i did i was eager to watch it. this movie gets 5 stars it had its up and downs and shows the simple mistake people make to mess up their path if you are thinking of stepping into the video life you should watch this movie
4,Study,This is an interesting book and opens many ideas and possibilities. His writing style leaves much to be desired.
1,Hated it...,"Three words come to mind when I think of this book: dull as dishwater. I confess I could only read about 60 pages of this book. What's the point? The author starts off by using such obscure words one needs a dictionary to follow the text. As if that wasn't enough, he starts inventing words to encapsulate the ""cutting edge"" concepts he's propounding. Can't say I agreed with much of the first sixty pages; I threw it down in disgust. I bought this book based upon the glowing reviews. I guess I didn't get it."
5,Mind-blowing,"It's not an easy read but this book blew my mind away.Dozens of other reviewers have already explained the content in a more eloquent way that I am able to do so I'll just summarize to say that Jaynes presents an amazing theory that breaks with common sense, explains central aspects of human behavior and culture, as well as specific phenomena such as hallucinations and hypnosis.Independently of whether the theory is correct or not, it's very impressive when an individual dares to combine different fields such as psychololgy, neuroscience, archeology, and ancient history to form a revolutionary and convincing thesis that completely breaks with common sense."
5,5 Stars for a Different Reason,"I read this book about 3 months ago and have been thinking about it ever since. During the read I was captivated by its originality but maintained an uneasiness about the subjectivity of much of Jaynes ""evidence"".The negative reviews are right. The book contains sweeping generalities, circular reasoning, questionable interpretation of ""evidence"", misunderstanding of material outside of Jaynes area of expertise, and is utterly ethnocentric.It is however a wonderfully captivating read! It will challenge your intellect, raise your awareness, lend opportunity to invoke your powers of reason and critical thinking, and most importantly it will provoke further thought and critical consideration. The book has many scientific problems but it rewards the reader simply on the basis of its originality and its ability to provoke thought. Read it with an open mind but analyze it with a critical eye."
5,"Easy, riveting, and necessary reading.","If you ever wondered about the nature of mind and consciousness,this is a delightful way to begin your quest for knowledge inthat arena. This book provides a solid introduction to thestudy and problems of conciousness, and goes on to proposea framework for clarifying some of these problems. Jaynesuses the current knowledge in neurology and psychiatry todefine the various aspects of what we now call consciousness,and then traces vestiges of these aspects in human history,litrature and archeology to arrive at a fairly plausiblehypothesis on when and how consciouseness may have evolvedin the human mind. Even if you find Mr. Jaynes' argumentsnot convincing, you will certainly find his erudition and scholarshipeducational and entertaining."
4,pesonal view,"Richard Dawkins finds this piece of work either ""utter rubbish"" or a brilliant piece of science. He believes that it is the former but is willing to hedge his bets! i think this is a brilliant piece of work and would like to congratulate Julian Jaynes on this masterpiece."
3,Very interesting and challenging,"If one can wade through the laborious and overally academic writing style this is interesting territory. However, the concept is really not that new. The forerunners of civilization in India were well versed in levels of human consciousness and a 3,000 year old collection of writings known as the ""Upanishads"" arose from this. The myths and stories and references to ""Gods"" in ancient thoughts have always been metaphor to explain something not easily explained by language. I don't know that Jaynes fully addresses this. And furthermore, even if the bicameral mind explains a broader consciousness we've forgotten because of a change in evolution or brain chemistry, or psyhic wounding, so what? Jaynes does not elaborate on the reason the right brain once dominated (if this is true), the real message and essence of the forgotten side of the brain and its broad meaning."
4,Eminently recommended,"A bold and eminently recommended text, rich in historical instances and thought provoking ideas.A carefully abridged version would favour the popularity of this book. Jaynes is certainly more floridly lyrical than logical and much more persuasive that convincing.He ignores significant archeological finds in his treatment of `gods' ( probably for academic respectability); but the reader can incorporate this with great profit to the thesis."
5,Until We Invent a Time Machine ... Read This Book!,"Julian Jaynes's book changed the way I view religion. I was always baffled by the way ancient people seemed to have such an intimate relationship with their gods, whereas we modern folk have to subsist on ineffable feelings, faith, and the occasional miracle of questionable validity.If you've read other reviews, you probably have a fair idea of what Jaynes's theory is. Is it true? Did it really happen like that? I have no idea. But his ideas explain a lot of things about why religion is the way it is, and that makes them very compelling.I suspect that Jaynes probably got a lot of things dead wrong -- he wasn't omniscient and lacked the ability to travel into the past. However, I am quite sure that there is at least a kernel of truth in what he says.In addition, I've never read any alternative proposals that have the explanatory power of his theory. So when I think about the evolution of religion, I always think about it in the terms he put forth."
5,"Excellent ""Starting out""","I consider this book an excellent introduction to the Ruy Lopez. Many plans for black and white are explained well. Obviously a professional player with a 2100+ ELO would need other books on specific variations, but since this book is a ""Starting Out"", it seems a perfect book.I think that people under 2000 does not need other books, a opening database or a playing software with a complete ""book tree"" can fill the gap."
4,Soft and Sweet Care Bear,"My 3 yr old niece gave this big snuggly Care Bear the thumbs up. So Soft and Cushy, great for a kid to snuggle with day or night."
1,"Cheap Product, Expensive Shipping, and NOT Worth It!","This controller extension worked well enough to be able to get by when I first got it, but was temperamental at best. 99% of the time, if the connection between the controller and the extension moved at all, the controller would stop working, and it had to be unplugged and plugged back in to make it work again. The adapter side that went into the Playstation itself was loose, but never seemed to act up.This lasted me a couple of weeks before it finally died, and when I went to unplug the controller from the extension in an attempt to make it work again, I discovered that the plastic itself had bent and broken at some point.This isn't worth the 8 dollars it cost me after shipping."
5,A Necessity for All Playstations,"I needed this for my ps two contoller, because the controller wire was just a slight bit too short. This works as it says, and is very inexpensive. I highly recommend this, because controller wires are very short without it."
4,This is good,Got this just as I needed it. Very happy everything new and packaged nicely. Glad with the results. HopeMy brother in law likes his present.
5,best game on psp i've ever played,"I've never played GOW or GOW2 before so I'm a newbie to this game. Due to the high ratings people gave I decided to give it a try. It's the best game I've ever played on psp. If you own a psp and you're old enough to play this game, you need to play it, otherwise you don't know what you've missed.The graphic's amazing. The game control is the best I've experienced on psp. The game designer made so many different combos for attacks and magic with the available keys on psp. There are four different difficulty levels so it will be fun and challenging for everyone. And you will also learn some neat stuff from Greek mythology.In conclusion, this is an epic game."
2,"Eh, so so","I kind of mad, I ordered the game in ""good"" condition, and it is, however the umd case is broken ands there is no manual to the game >:("
3,OK game,The game is just OK according to the review and experience playing with. That is what young children report as a feedback having it for a month.
3,"Great graphics/sound, disappointingly short","We just bought a PSP so I don't know if it's par for the course, but the graphics in this game are really stunning. Details are crisp and clear, and the cinematics are great to watch. The camera view is fluid and easy to watch, so you don't feel like you have to crane your neck to see what's around corners (yes, I've done it!).With headphones, the sound adds a lot to the game. The voices sound professional and the sound effects are very detailed.I am really disappointed with the length of the game though. Before I knew it, it was over. I think my total gametime was about 6 hours, which is really a bad value for the money - almost $7/hr I paid for this entertainment. I really don't think I'd buy it again if I'd known how short it was."
4,"God of Short, Chains of Awesomeness","While GOW: Chains of Olympus isn't one of the longest games I've played on the PSP - it does have a nice tight package that stays true to the history and gameplay of God of War. While the controls do give you cramps if you play for to long, this is still a fun game that's easy to play on the road for short periods of times.The story ties perfectly into the GOW timelines and kratos is as fun as ever. Definitely worth picking up if you have a PSP. One of the must have games for the system."
5,great,i spent days looking for the cheapest price for this game. in my opinion the best game for PSP and ive been playing since it got here
5,The God of the PSP,"This is one of the best games for the console (PSP) NO DOUBT. Fun, challenging, new stuff."
4,Pros/Cons,Pros:- Same outstanding combat engine as its console counterpart- Best graphics yet on a psp- Superb voice acting- Decent replay value and unlockables- Overall production values are second to noneCons:- Way too short- No new gameplay elements
4,warning : boobies,yeah. there are nudity in this game so yeah if you buy for your kids watch out unless you dont mind :D
3,"Rated ""P"" for Porn","My 13 year old daughter is a huge fan of Warcraft, and when I went looking for a Warcraft experience on the PSP, the guys at the game store recommended God of War for her. I'm used to seeing the Mature rating on games, but this game should have been rated ""P"" for Porn.For those parents who haven't been told, there is a scene about 20 minutes into the game where the character has to please two naked women in bed before they can move on to the next stage. I've been a gamer all my life and this is the first interactive porn I've seen in a major title."
2,Awful,"This game is just outright awful. Cruddy camera angles, slow unresponsive controls, and horrible graphics with jagged edges and awful frame rates. I really expected more from a franchise like this, but prepare to be disappointed if you buy this."
2,To repettitive to short and to lame.,this game is not very fun. the combat is extremely repettitive it tries to put nudity and sex in videogames which is always retarted to do and its short. the game really isnt as good as everyone says it is dont buy it
2,IS TOO SHORT,I FINISH THIS GAME IN 2 HOURS OF GAME PLAY IS TOO EASY AND TOO SHORT. THE GRAPHICS ARE GOOD BUT I LIKE GAMES WITH MORE PLAY TIME. IF I`M GOIN TO SPEND 45 OR 50 DOLARS ON A GAME AT LEAST I WANT 6 OR 8 HOURS OF GAME PLAY WITHOUT GET BORING PLAYING.
5,Will definately make you a Kratos fan,"I gotta say this game is awesome. as soon as i started playing it, I was hooked. The graphics and display are great.The story line and movie scenes are fantastic. If you're a Zelda and/or a castlevania fan, then you have to play God of War. I admit that God of War for the PSP is the first one i've played (Since i'm a soldier in iraq it's the only thing i have) so i'm a newly found Kratos fan. So much that i went ahead and bought God of War 1 and 2 for PS2. which i can't wait to play when i get back home. but for now, i'm still hooked on this one.Even after you beat the game, it's a must to play again with the new unlocked character. which only makes you want to play until all characters and features are unlocked. A must for your PSP collection."
3,Fun but short,"This game is overall a great game. The controlls are simple, graphics are great, and replayability is there. The only Thing I find wrong with this game is the story is very short. I litlerly beat the game in 4 days. And I am not saying I played it all day, I mean a few hours here and ther for 4 days and I beat. So dont expect this to be FF 12 long."
4,Kept me entertained,Pretty good game. Kept me busy for a while. Story line was long enough and entertaining for me to keep on coming back and actually finish the game.
5,Better than GoW: Ghost of Sparta!!,"I bought this game brand new on here (as you can see, Amazon Verified Purchase lol) and it came in fast and everything. I love the game so much, better gameplay, better fight scenes and longer than GoW: Ghost of Sparta. This game was totally worth ever single penny!! :D"
1,god of war,what the hell the game is a demo a freaking demo give me the full game you scamed me i want my 5.00 back i have the demo i wanted the full version
3,what can i say,it came poorly packaged without a case from japan so it was not worth returning.- a a a a a
4,Great Game!!!,"God Of War: Chains Of Olympus is an excellent game. Gameplay is very unique. The storyline is pretty good and interesting. You are taken to many unique locations. There are a huge variety of enemies to fight. Luckily, you have many different attacks including combos and magic. The graphics are actually pretty good for a PSP game. However, the game is very short. I finished the game in 3 hours."
2,Don't believe everything you read...,"I've been using Permanent Californians for roughly 7 years now;while it provides great biographical information and a decent basicguide to who has been interred where, Culbertson and Randall have failed miserably in their efforts to provide specific gravesite locations. I have wasted too much precious daylight in vain assessments of which tree they presume to be the largest within a particular cemetery section, ultimately searching around each and every tree in said section only to conclude that the book is just plain wrong. I've noted many typos with regard to section numbers/grave numbers, and had to learn the hard way *never* to trust their directions as gospel truth. Very useful as a basic reference, but be advised: don't expect much in the way of orienteering."
2,did NOT exceed my expectations!,"I do not normally pick up a book and hate it at first sight, but so it was with this one. At first I felt there must be something wrong with me, and tried reading it again. However, I feel obliged to say that at times the discriptions and explanations were long-winded, and his attempts at analysis were not particularly original."
3,Until you know the facts.....,"This is a fun sort of a book which has a lot of interesting biographical information pertaining to those 'permanent Californians'. However, if you plan to use it as a guidebook you'll find that directions are often confusing and inaccurate. There are several books currently available which provide better information for locating burial sites and (for that matter) more comprehensive listings per cemetery. Just don't view this book as being accurate re: grave locations/directions. The end result will be total frustration."
5,Really satisfied,T-shirt arrived across Atlantics by regular mail just within a week - that's fast!Everything precisely as described and there were no additional costs (customs duties) to be paid - that's great !To put it short - I am very satisfied by this purchase.
1,Way Over-Priced,"I was eager to receive this book, but was highly disappointed with it. In my opinion, this book was highly over-priced and outdated. I found it to be very simple (things many of us already know) and more designed to children running a haunted house for a school fund raiser. Unless you can get this book for $5 or less, don't waste yor money."
4,Pretty good overall,its a good book put the book needs better pics. The inside of the book is black and white. and the pictures are stick figeurs
1,terrible service,"the picture used to advertise this item contained the tremor pack and a bonus memory card, yet all i received was a tremor pack. Also the tremor hardly works."
2,This thing ...,"It doesn't even deserve two stars. I gave it one star because it came with an extra memory card... I gave the other star because it tricked me into buying it. This thing just isn't rumble quality, I wouldn't buy it unless you want an extra card spot in it with a card... blah blah... Get a Dreamcast anyways lol."
5,So good.,"I watched Meadowlark in an intimate concert in Springdale, Utah in 2005. Their music was so beautiful that I bought this and ""Legend of the Land."" I have not been disappointed. What a great relaxing album."
1,Ambrose was a complete fraud,"I know when people say things like this, it sounds harsh or overdone. Stephen Ambrose was a known plagiarist and much of his work was just made up. Its to such a point that you cannot at all take his work as truthful. He was exposed at the end of his life and then after his death for completely fabricating his relationship with Eisenhower. Its not just a matter of him ripping off sources, he completely made up much of his history. You will know less from reading him than you would not reading him. Getting through all the lies is going to be a job."
1,had to see if this was as bad as the cover !,"it was worse !ill give sabato jr credit for trying a new role but he was miserable as was everyone else. i guess the wardrobe person did an ok job. no need to go into a speil about the story. its about henry lee lucas, infamous ''serial'' killer. sabatos future is now this generations lorenzo lamas. when will i stop giving into movies about real life maniacs ?!?!?!?!"
3,Not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be,"Watched this movie last night and thought it was okay. Not much gore, not as violent as I imagined it might be. In both Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, and this rendition, I was disappointed that the writers pandered to the mainstream and left out the glaring fact that Ottis was homosexual and Henry & him were ""lovers"" of sorts in the true story."
1,The worst movie about a serial killer I've ever seen!,"I've seen almost all the movies about serial killers including the very disturbing Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Drifter is pure fluff, made for TV crap! Just look at the cast of pretty people including and starring ex-soap opera star Antonio Sabato, Jr. This movie is not scary, gorey or dark like most serial killer movies should be; it's just plain cheesy and lame. I would give it zero stars but I don't think that's possible. Be warned."
2,Laughable production quality ***possible spoilers***,"There were so many flaws in Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas, I don't know where to start ...TV Movie of the Week quality.Numerous gaffes.Twice, one of the actors looked at the camera. In any real movie, the editor/director would have re-shot the scene.When the dead hitchhiker is getting raped on the couch, you can see the camerman's shadow.Henry's scar on his eye keeps changing between scenes.When the doctor is preparing to give Henry shock treatment, he has the nurse take out Henry's glass eye. While he's shocking Henry and questioning him afterward, it is obvious that the eye is still in place, the actor is just looking upward to make it more ominous.The actors' ""accents"" were too funny. I'm guessing the director told them to ""talk real slow, cuz that's how dumb people talk.""Overall, fairly laughable. Unfortunately, not funny enough to be a cult classic."
4,I HAVE NOTHING TO KILL BUT TIME,"Henry ( Antonio Sabato Jr.) is in custody of the Texas Rangers and is treated like royalty as he confesses to many crimes seen as flashbacks. Raised by an abusive mother and living dirt poor all his life, Henry embarks on a killing spree unlike anything in history. Henry teams up with Ottis (Kostas Sommer) as they are a natural pair. Henry is a necrophilia, because women talk too much. Ottis is a cannibal. He has sex with the women while they are alive. They kill the girl, then it is Henry's turn. Ottis then eats her...""She ain't a girl, she's just juicy white meat.""I enjoyed the 50's style soundtrack and theme song. The movie is not extremely graphic. The acting was fairly decent with Becky (Kelly Curran) having an accent and lines bordering on camp. The plot moves slow so as to develop Henry's character. Think of this slasher film as ""Natural Born Killers"" light.F-bomb, sex, rape-like scenes, necrophilia, no nudity."
4,Whacked out psycopaths,I purchased this movie after having researched these two killers and was impressed at the accuracy in which Henry Lee Lucas at least was portrayed. The movie itself was not gory but does get the point across as to how vicious and sadistic these two psycos were. Totally callous to their victims and very brutal in their rapes. These men were definetely better off dead which they both are now. Ottis Toole died in prison in 1998 and Lucas in 2001. This movie will show you how the mind of a true psycopath works.
2,was not as said,thie size was totally off i got an extra lagrge and it was more like a small. i gave it to my 11yr old granfdaughter
2,Camo Shirt,Ok shirt. Bought it for camo day at my daughters school. Runs VERY small and we bough the large. It served its purpose and that was about it.
2,was suppose to be a copy of the orginal,this seems to be written for kids and not on the origal document for reading. Har to read with that scrolled lettering
4,almost as good as a psp,"The psone with monitor was ahead of its time. If Japan had madea movie card for the smaller psone, one might have been able to watch video cds on it, audio cds, and play playstation games that only cost 5 dollars a piece at gamestop. I think if they had made the extra effort and built one for the smaller psone(since the japanese psone movie card plays on both the older American and Japanese psone's), you could get a bigger version of the psp for half the cost. Still, the psone with monitor has alot of appeal to gamer fans. I give this product four and a half stars."
5,Great Educational Resource!,This product was used for my after school classroom tutorial class. It works well with my educational CD's and still in use to this day.
1,Keep Looking,"I read the reviews by the other reviewers before I bought this book and they convinced me to buy it. However, I was extremely disappointed in this book and found it of no help at all. If you're looking for self-help book that will actually help you, keep looking."
2,Does not shine as bright as Gang Starr (sorry for the pun)...,"I got this CD used based on some of the reviews on here. Don't trust them (except me, of course).I really like Gang Starr. Guru is in Gang Starr. Guru makes a Jazzmatazz record. The next logical step would be for me to like this record, right? Wrong.One of the problems I found with this album is the music. I don't see how this is a Jazz & Hip-Hop fusion. It sounds like a bad Hip-Hop record with samples of bad Jazz melodies - not new recordings with musicians. The Jazz portion doesn't feel like genuine Jazz. Furthermore, there are too many choruses and hooks. I felt like I was hearing too much of the same thing. Longer verses, musical breaks, anything else would have been better.My advice: sample it before you purchase it. This is NOT a no-brainer pickup like the review score and the name on the album cover may lead you to believe."
1,Not a book,"What a disappointment! This ""book"" is little more than a collection of anecdotal success stories gleaned from postings on an on-line news list. (Most of the successes were moderate, none complete.) The author promotes the use of MSM Sulphur, the same advice you might get from a good health food store or alternative health professional. Save yourself the [$$$]."
5,A great and very informative book,"This was an Oprah Book Club selection, and after reading it, I understood why. Elizabeth Mills does a wonderful job of portraying the life of a woman, who was born a slave, and after gaining her freedom, went on to establish a plantation empire. The book is well researched and well written, and for those interested in colonial and antebellum Louisiana, this book is a ""must read."""
5,Isle Of Canes,"I loved it.I have have always been fascinated by the gens de coluer libre and the Louisiana creole language. The book was awesome, the amount of historical documents: ie slave manumissions, etc is an accomplishment within itself. The strength of Coincoin, that was then transferred to Augustin which enabled him to build the Isle into a force that was respected by all cannot be underrated. I recommend the book to all interested in a not so Celebrated part of American, French and Spanish History in North America."
4,Very well done; a must for any History Teacher,I use these films in my Ancient & A.P. European History classes. The students like them very much (and so do I eventhough I've seen them several dozen times). The films only use realistic re-enactors and battle scenes. I highly recommend these films
3,Crank up the Victrola!,"I was hoping for a little more digital remastering... However, once I got past the antique effect, I really enjoyed this CD. Refreshing. Raw. Real."
1,Flawed design.,The cap that gives access to the battery compartment is poorly designed and difficult to operate. The activation switch located on the same cap is an even worse design than the cap itself. The shaft operates intermitantly out of round and the operation doesn't always stop when you release the switch.Despite all these shortcomings you can get acceptable results but only as long as you use cold non-fat milk. In order to warm it you have to microwave the foam and whip it again. I'm back on the market looking for a replacement.
1,Tricky to froth soy milk but figured it out,"I originally rated this one star and would like to change it, but Amazon's edit feature won't let me. Anyway.. at the time I gave it one star, i could not get it to froth my soy milk. Turns out, you have to froth it in a completely different way from the manual press frother:1. Get cup/mug/beaker of COLD soy milk.2. Insert electric frother and turn on, moving frother up and down in and out of the soy milk.3. You will quickly get large head of decent foam. Don't get too much, because...4. Put in microwave and heat as desired. Foam will QUICKLY GO CRAZY IN MICROWAVE, DOUBLING YOUR AMOUNT OF FOAM.5. Use as desired.I give this a 4 star foam experience. :-)"
3,"Serviceable, but not Bodum's best work","I just took delivery of this frother, as part of the set including a beaker. It does the job of frothing milk well enough. But taken as a complete product package, instructions and all, I found it to be lacking.As with other Bodum products I've bought, there were step-by-step instructions for use, each step having some text and a little photograph. However, there was no mention of how to power the thing: how to remove the cap for the battery compartment, what size batteries to use, whether rechargeable batteries were compatible, etc. Neither was there any mention of how to care for it.Yes, common sense should dictate some details (for example, that you should not immerse the unit in water), but the omission of such basic instructions is baffling, especially from such an experienced consumer product maker as Bodum."
4,Nice quality for the price,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, as I broke the one he had bought at Ikea for $1.99. This model was somewhat larger then the Ikea one, and the ""pulse"" option was definitely a plus! Arrived quickly and packaged well. It's a little cumbersome to store, but definitely more powerful then the cheaper versions."
3,Good enough!,"This product it is pretty nice, one of the thing I really don't like is that you can't separate the mixer from the base at the moment of wash it!"
2,Worked great! Until it didn't.,It gave great foam for the first six months and didn't run through batteries too quickly. Then it stopped working altogether at about 7 months out. It was getting used about three or four times a week (at most) during it's life so I'm thinking next time I'll just buy the $2 one at Ikea and say goodbye to this dude.
2,bodum milk frother,"For the brief time I owned this frother it did a nice job of whipping up milk for latte and hot chocolate. It was made of fairly flimsy plastic, however, and after a week it stopped working. I replaced it with the Aerolatte, which is much sturdier and does an excellent job frothing."
1,Defective Product. ANTonline will not refund,"I bought this EPSON product #S041271 photo paper as the same product# I have used for many years to make calendars. The product received was in a different box, although the # was the same, but would not absorb the ink on the reverse side. Contacted ANTonline who responded that consumables are not refundable although I could not find where it said that on the website and they would no longer respond. Will never buy from them again."
2,Package was opened.,"The box was completely opened, and the plastic packet containing the paper was open at the corner. The paper looks mostly undamaged, and I am using it for personal use, not selling my printouts, but still. Not really satisfied, but I need it now, don't have time to send it back."
3,I take this item oct.16,it takes so long. although thank you for sending.But I would want item to receive faster.thank you.
2,Diwia Reel,I found this reel to be a bit on the heavy side with a sturdy die casting. When I removed the handle screw to make it a left hand retrieve I was surprised to see the white plastic bearing broken in two pieces. This reel is also quite noisy and the supplied monofilament line is of poor quality. The casting button is also loose and appears to be a weak link in the design. Now I feel like I'm stuck with it although still functional. Made in Thailand. Disappointing.
2,Diawa reel,we had trouble with the reel being excessivly noisy and sent it in for a warranty repair.
3,Not as good as the Silver series reels,"Even though this reel is a level wind reel, it is not to smooth once you use it regularly. I have the silver series spincast reels (Daiwa) and they are far superior even without the level wind."
2,What a drag,The drag adjustment wheel wouldn't stay where I set it. The drag was too light even when set at the highest level. I contacted an authorized Daiwa service center and I was told that there must be a stripped part. I also had intermittant reeling problems like something was interfering with the gears. I ended up returning this reel to Amazon for a refund. I was very disappointed with the reel considering the majority of reviewers had good things to report about it with the exception of the adjustment wheel issue. This was my first and last purchase of a Daiwa reel and will try Abu-Garcia reels next time.
4,Goldcast 100,The reel seems to be well made of durable materials. It casts and retrieves well. If it sat a little lower on the rod and did not make a clicking noise on the retrieve I would give it 5 stars. Daiwa is close to spincast perfection with this reel if they would only tweak the design a little more. If you don't mind a clicking sound from the anti-reverse pawl when retrieving a fish and the reel sitting high off the rod I would recommend this reel as a quality spincast reel.
2,Not as good as our old ones,One of the tables broke the next day. Then others started breaking days later. So disappointed :( I guess these aren't the same kind of tables I bought years ago.
4,Great Set!,"This is a great set. It's sturdy, and a good buy. Doesn't look cheap and does just what it's made out to do. The storage piece is a great addition."
5,good solid tables,"Stand is super great, tables are very good quality. Very happy with the purchase but shoud have just gotten one table, we didn't need a set of 4."
1,Unadulterated junk,"I ordered this product based on a few previous reviews. When I opened the box, I was shocked. First, the image on Amazon showed beautifully grained tables. The top of each was made from mismatched, sawtooth joined thin boards. The finish was VERY poor and was rough. The overall quality was below poor. These tables are junk - I got taken - please avoid them.I have bought items from Amazon for years and this is the first negative product review I have ever written. I am amazed that Amazon would even consider selling this product. By the way, the price has increased over 20% in the past three months."
4,Thick & Sturdy,"A bit taller than most other trays I've seen. Check at your local Target to see if they're in stock to save the $40 shipping, though."
5,Great for the price!,"These rack up nicely and take up little space in my tiny downtown apartment. They feel like real wood throughout rather than wood paneling slapped on top of plywood. These will not splinter or chip.If you want tables that you'll love for decades to come, then spend the big bucks. If you need something sufficient for right now, buy these."
4,Worth the money,"I rated this item a 4 star because the stand is wobbly - other than that the tables themselves are great - big enough, sturdy and a nice light oak color."
2,Poor Quality,"Two of the four tables in our set are level, but don't close easily. The uneven two tables close without trouble, of course. I would not advise purchasing these."
2,Does no stay opened,These trays tend to collapse when lifting them up. We have other trays which lock into place and do not pose a risk of spilling as these trays do.
4,Good Product,Purchased as a Christmas gift. Recipient seems to love them. Constructed well and priced competitively. This is a good product.
3,Winsome TV table tray set,"Nice appearance. With assembly, one hole was not aligned properly and had to drill a new hole to make it work, then find some wood filler to fill in the hole that was not used."
5,Great Soundtrack!,"I had the opportunity to see this video a few times, and afterwards, I knew that I had to have this soundtrack. It is just great and it mixes sounds of jazz, the blues, and Gospel all together. My most favorites are ""If You See A Devil,"" ""Feast On Me,"" and the quartet finale.This play starred 2 of America's most-beloved actresses, Esther Rolle and Mabel King, who have both been dead for several years. If you're fans of these 2 ladies, then this is definately a MUST HAVE!"
4,Escape,"If you are having trouble coping with winter depression, or blahs in any season, try escaping to a Greek isle, soaking up the sun, relaxing with bouzouki music, and meeting interesting people. OK, maybe the experience is vicarious; but, it might help you out of the winter doldrums. D.R. Ransdell's book, ""Amirosian Nights"", will enable you to do all of the above and much more. A fun read and a fast escape--you will be whisked away to another part of the world where you can quickly become a part of a displaced mariachi player's life. ""Amirosian Nights"" is definitely worth your time if you have any interest in Greece or music, and a ""must read"" if you like both!Thanks, Carmen Besso"
3,"Some helpful tips, very basic, some problems","I've purchased two homes so far, just for my primary residence. Irwin's book is really geared for someone who has NEVER owned a home. Kind of an odd place to start for someone getting into real estate investing. Not a lot is said about how to start if you already own a home. Also, some of the parts on ""flipping"" were just silly. The woman walking down the street and stumbling upon a house for sale $50K below market? Come on. However, there are some good tips, like I said, and the part on apartment building valuation and investing was new to me."
5,Great buy,This is the most helpful and informative book on real eastate I've read yet. Lots of nuts-and-bolts information from a person in a position to know. Well written and well presented.Recommended.
1,No more hyper pens available,We lost the hyper pen for the HP1500U tablet we have and when I went online to the AIPTEK site it said they were temporarily out./ I called the company and they said the company in Taiwan tha makes the tablets has advised them that they no longer will be making any extra pens. Anyone have any suggestions as to what would be a suitable replacment? Contact me at geoffrey.frasz@csn.edu if you have some suggestions. I'd hate to have to buy a whole new package just to get the pen.
3,"Fine for amatuers, insufficient for pros","I've used this particular tablet for several years now and have recently upgraded to the Wacom Intuos. The tablet itself is sturdy and very durable with a metal backing. The cursor accelleration does not quite match the stylus, but the position is accurate, and the sensitivity is adequate. The setup options for the tablet are vastly inferior to Wacom's control panel, however, and the mouse (as on most tablets) is a joke. It's actually a good buy if you're just going to play around with it (as you get a larger tablet for your money than the graphire or Intuos), but if you're serious about your art, you will probably want to spend the extra money for the features and software the Wacom tablets provide."
4,"Ben Turpin, four good examples","Another fine collection of silent comedies from this wonderful cross-eyed comedian. The quality is quite watchable, but shows it's age, still a must and quite recommended for any collector of silent comedy."
4,"Liked the movie, quick delivery.",I bought this movie after seeing it on Netflix Instant View so that I could check out special features. Unfortunately I cracked the disc trying to get it out of the case...My bad.
2,A little flimsy,"Not a good value for the price. Although it was interesting and a rather unique puzzle, the skeleton is small and rather flimsy. I was disappointed in the product.I purchased the skeleton for my nephew, who was going to through a phase where he enjoyed anything dinosaur. He liked the skeleton for the first few minutes, but after that he lost interest."
5,WOW!,This portable Playstation is GREAT! Everything is soo clear on the screen! It is just like the regular Playstation! It is light and is alot cheaper that the regular Playstation and the portable one is just as good! I would reccomend this to everyone because.....because it is great! You can take this thing everywhere at any time! If you don't have it.... You should get it!
5,The only thing you could want!,I think this 5 inch LCD screen is a great idea! You can take it anywhere anytime... the person who thought of this idea is very creative. THANK-YOU SONY FOR THIS IDEA!
2,Disappointed,"My daughter got the PS1 with LCD screen combo for Christmas a year ago, and when we opened it and hooked it up, the screen did not work properly. The screen was black, but if you held it at an angle, you could tell there were graphics present. Yes, we adjusted the contrast and nothing helped. We took it back and they had no more in stock, so we went to Sears. We got their last one and I asked to hook it up and try it out before we left--just in case. Sure enough, it did the same thing, so we left empty handed. Finally, we found a combo unit at Target and it worked--for about 7 months. A few months ago, it started going on the fritz and if we unplugged the cable and fiddled with it, it would work again. It finally quit working alltogether. It was great while it worked, but now I'm leery as to how long another one will work. Is a 90 day warranty sufficient for an item so pricey? I don't think so. I'm faced with replacing it, because to fix it would probably cost even more. What a shame."
4,Its better than a TV!!!!!!!!,The Playstation LCD screen is great the graphics are really clear and you can adjust the volume and brightness whenever you want. The LCD sceen may cost a lot but it is definetly worth it.
3,There are others........,"I purchased this book as a guide book for kayaking lakes that I may have not known about. I found the book lacking on listing ALL the possible lakes not just some the author knew. I was looking for a lake guide book that list every lake, pond, maybe river not just a few. I had the older book and that listed even less. This also concentrates on the wildlife and plant life rather than describing the actual lake. This could be a really good guide book if it were done better..........."
3,Incorrect Description this part is for the REAR,"Incorrect Description - K90467 is the bellows for the REAR strut, K90463 for the FRONT. Please check the listing in the online MOOG catalog..."
5,MUSIC & LIGHTS,"This great cd is full of music that forces you to move to the beat...reminds me of when I lived in England.If anyone knows where I can get Phil Fearon/Galaxy's Greatest Hits, let me know."
4,The Hutchinson Concise Dictionary of Music,"The Hutchinson Concise Dictionary of Music is a great reference material for all who are interested in music. This dictionary offers exact definitions of musical terms and concepts. It gives not only the definitions, but also background and origin information. It suggests the most common time period for the music and how it relates to other times in history. I recommend this book for both beginning and advance students of music because of its clarity and accuracy of information."
1,Is this an illegal pirate?,"I HAVE TO TELL ALL OF YOU: 6 and 1/2 from the first 10 songs in CD 1 are nothing but pieces from ""Luis Bonfa plays"" and ""Jazz Samba Encore!"" and others, wrongly titled as Jobim's products. I don't understand that, since the first reviewer has bought so many bossa nova CDs, he still doesnt realize this fact."
4,good sleeper,"Of all the Duncans I find this one to be the best sleeper/spinner for tricks. Sometimes it seems to be a bit off balance when it sleeps by leaning to one side & its quite loud. The good is its durability, I've had the Rocket Pro (by Razor) and the Peter Fish both spin loose causing the yoyo to come apart during spinning. I still prefer the Peter Fish brand, but for a Duncan its right up there! Great one for tricks :D"
3,"It works, but it isn't level.","This yoyo reminds me of the fun I had with yoyos as a kid. I bought 2, one for me and one for my husband because we recently played with one and thought it would be fun to learn the tricks again. However, this yoyo is not level and has no hold time at all. It is a simple yoyo and would make a beginner happy, but I need something more substantial for all the tricks."
4,Impressive,"These modern yo-yos are much improved over the classics such as the Imperial and the Butterfly. I'm an adult, avid Amazon.com shopper and am re-learning yo-yos The Duncan Bumblebbee is the best I've tried yet. I can't do tricks yet, but this one has a very because they are fun. This yo-yo has a smooth action and the sleep/spin time is fantastic. It does have a weird sound right before the yo-yo returns, but that might be the brake or is just spinning fast. So for that I give it 4 stars. Just under $9 here. When selecting a gift to a child, I recommend this one (the Bumblebee) or the Duncan Mosquito. For a few more $$$, you get a much better yo-yo than the classic Imperial or Butterfly. Those aren't bad, but invest a few $$ more and your child will like it better. It's a good, inexpensive toy, and for a child, they will learn concentration skills and hand-eye coordination."
4,bumble bee yo-yo,"This is a good yo yo , Because a kid needs some skills, because it might be a little difficult to retrieve once it goes down. But over all it was great I liked it."
4,kids love it,"My 6 year old son loves dinosaurs and computers. He loves this game. It seems to combine fast paced short games with a map/ collect/ find things and other activities. Like any game like this, it has high and low points..."
5,Great dino game for kids!,"My 4 year old son is obsessed with dinosaur computer games. This is a really neat, non violent game that is great for kids!! Of course when he first got it, he wanted to sit at the computer for several hours until he ""defeated the Trex"" (by hatching all the eggs), so I let him. He really enjoyed it! It was easy for him to understand, and to maneuver around. There are several levels, so I don't think he'll get tired of it. Overall, great game!"
4,dinosaur 3d,"from the kids ""it is a computer game and you get to describe other dinosaurs and you get to explore caves and volcanos and can play different games to get an egg hatching crystal and you get to click on where the taradactileshows you where to look for the egg that is cracked open and you get to save little baby dinosaurs""i recommend this game"
3,Problems with Windows 7 RC,"This game installs well, wants to know you name and email but works without actually registering with an open Internet connection. However, the graphics are not working well on Windows 7 RC. Dinosaurs would have color bleed of pixellated greens and reds in the middle of the body, the sky and background suddenly start having this color problem and not related to the amount of motion involved in that particular sequence of screenplay. Something about DirectX 11 of Windows 7 RC? Just guessing. By the way, OpenGL was functioning perfectly at full speed (Furmark 6000) when I observed this."
5,Finally,"I have been waiting for this for years now, ever since DVD's have come out, and it's about time. This series is amazing! I highly recommend this DVD set, it is a great collector's item for fans. I only have one question... when is the deluxe Star Wars six pack going to come out?"
1,Not the Films I grew up with,"While I must concede that I have been anticipating the release of Star Wars on DVD since the format became mainstream - I am severely disappointed in the treatment presented here.These films are not the original Star Wars films from '77-83, these are not even the versions released in '97 as definitive. What we are given here is what Lucas would like us to believe is his ""true vision."" Be that as it may, the movies pale in comparison with his ""half-finished"" works from 25 years ago.With that in mind, these are great DVDs. The picture is good throughout (aside from a few skips). However, an important note is that the Audio is horrible through most of the trilogy. Not only are there major adjustments to the volume of the score in comparison with effects, but the channels are botched in 5.1, and there are also sequences of drowned out dialogue."
1,Message in a bottle : listen,"It sure is a shame that a legacy which has been built on such an ardent fan base would have to be tarnished by the unwillingness to listen.. No Lucas, you are not bigger than your fan base.. get real and listen! Poeple want the ORIGINAL versions; and yes, if you must, throw in the butchered releases too."
1,More added scenes...,"I loved these films growing up (as most people did), and I was disappointed by the 1997 re-releases. But these new changes really take the cake; over-dubbing Jeremy Bulloch's dialogue as Boba Fett with a very flat sounding Temuera Morrison ruined ESB for me, and RotJ just isn't the same for me anymore without the Ewok song at the end. Plus replacing Anakin at the ending is just plain insulting.Maybe one day George Lucas will come around and give the fans what they want; the original movies!"
1,New DVD set just a commercial for Episode 3,"I love Star Wars. I *love* Star Wars. But this isn't the Star Wars I remember. Hayden Christensen is *not* supposed to be standing next to Alec Guiness at the end of Return of the Jedi. And the horribly intrusive and distracting additions made in the 90's feel even more glaring in this release.I bought my videos before the release of the remastered (with extra scenes) videos, and that's what I'll be watching. *Not* these DVDs."
1,NO STARS for this STAR WARS,"George Lucas once said the problem other sci-fi filmmakers make is that they spend so much time on sets, costumes, etc. that they spend screen time on it at the expense of story to say ""look what we can do"". Then along comes ROTJ Special Edition with an alien running towards the screen yelling out a song as we look at his tonsils. Gee, George...a ""look what we can do"" moment?The worst ""special"" edition moment has to be Greedo shooting first! I'd rather kiss a Wookie than buy this.GEORGE LUCAS...YOU CREATED THEN DESTROYED!!!YOU RUINED STAR WARS!YOU SUCK!"
1,Del Shannon's 'Runaway',"Del Shannon created one of Rock n Rolls most memorable songs of all time....Runaway in 1961.In 1967, Del Shannon re-recorded Runaway. It was a cleaner, more polished version of his original smash hit. It was still a good song, but something was missing. It just didn't have the 'Feel' of the original. Less sorrow, less ferocity. Del Shannon felt his original 1961 version was too gritty, and he could catch a bigger audience if he just cleaned it up. He was wrong. By re-recording it, he had changed the song. Purists, and fans of the golden era of Rock n Roll wouldn't go near the re-recorded version of 'Runaway'.This is how I feel about The Star Wars original trilogy. The Special editions are altered versions of the originals.It is not the same series of classic films. Fans of the original trilogy feel the same.I'm not buying the Blu-Ray."
4,"a new hope: excellent, but some flaws","i won't say anything for the changes since i only watched the episode 4 of the set by now (i received it yesterday). the story is the same too, not anything to complaint. the video quality is superb. the film doesn't show its age. i can say that the picture quality is sharper than the sequel dvd's. but there are some flaws in the picture. during the opening sequence there are reddish flashes which can be handled better. another one, which is very disturbing, is occurs during the vader vs kenobi duel. as the sabers clashes a yellowish green halo (sabers are blue and red) and it doesn't look like an effect resulting due to saber clashes. since lots of time has passed since i've watched episode 4, i can't remember if those were present in the original movie though. and the last, but not the least, some shots of tie fighters haven't get cleaned of the boxes around them. the sound? perfect."
2,"The greatest movies of all time, NOT!","I am so sick and tired of people claiming the Star Wars sagas are so great. Yeah, they were great when I was 6 years old in 1977, but now I feel like it was the begining of new era in movies. The era of a two hour toy commericals featuring the muppets for laughs. George Lucas has been riding this pony way to long, time to move on. Star Wars has become stale like a flat coke and boring with time. If you want great movies, and trills, try Pulp Fiction, Seven, Fight Club, JFK, and Sixth Sense!"
4,A epic classic?,"Even though the trilogy has been pasted up by more epic, up to date works, such as Lord of the Rings and Matrix, Star Wars is still the first standard bearer of the level of quality that can be accomplished in this genre of science fiction and fantasy.The development of the heroes, classical archtypes such as the rogue, the father/son religious complex all have been used without much degree of success in successive generations of movies, until lately."
2,Why more expensive here then in UK?,"The product look the same to me, apart from the 30% less they charge on amazon.co.uk, and the region coding of the dvd (to make sure north americans can't play europeans dvds on their machines)."
1,Not The Original,"This is not the Star Wars I came to know and love. I can see the desire to want to try to improve on an old film, but to do so and act like the originals never existed is wrong. I can not give these movies higher than a 1 until the true original films are released as well."
4,It's still Star Wars,"Sure, they may have ruined somethings, but all in all it's still Star Wars. It just sucks because the ""enhancements"" only seemed to bring the quality down. Especially replacing the original Anakin with the new one. I mean Lucas obviously did it to please all of the new fans, but what about the ones that have been following these films ever since they came out or were old enough to understand them, that's like spitting in our faces. Not to mention the face of the original Anakin. The picture and sound quality are definitely better, but the added fx are cheesy for the most part, I just wish they would have left that stuff alone."
4,Cheap set,I was really disapointed in the quality of this set it seem rather cheap when compaired to other set's like alien quadrilogy for example. The box it comes in is very cheap and will not last long wich is wierd considering this was the most anticipated movies to come to dvd? And also the transfer's seem over saturated with color and to dark in other parts of the film's and also the sound for the most part is amazing but in some area's the sound is very loud then get's to the point where it is to low and you have to turn the volume up I found myself turning it up and down alot. As far as them being the special editions that does not bother me although I do prefer the untouched version's these will have to do for now I just wish the box set was of higher quality.
1,Can The REAL Star Wars Movies Come Out...EVER?,"The more I read about the reviews of this newly remastered, re-edited, re-done (constantly!) monster that George Lucas is putting out on DVD, the more I want to burn and destroy every copy out there and spit on Lucas as being known by the stupid world audience that he's a great filmmaker -- garbage! The man has no respect for his original work, and disowned it like a father would his son. What kind of respect should we have for the poor delusional soul who can't make up his mind on how he wants his movies edited. I mean, the man placed a newly created (again!) computer-imposed group of happy-lolly-gagging Gungans in the ending celebration scene on Ewok in Return Of The Jedi. Good God, George Lucas simply sucks!!!"
5,Great one,I always loved Star Wars since it was on VHS but now with its clean version of pictures and sounds its getting greater..Watch it with a home Theater :)
1,Not the original trilogy on blu-ray,"Like the other thousand people before me, I got my hopes up that this blu-ray release would contain the original theatrical versions of episodes IV-VI. Now that I know that is not the case, I won't be putting any money in George Lucas' pocket this year. I hated the special/enhanced/modified/desecrated editions when they came out on VHS and DVD many moons ago and there's no need to see that fecal matter in 1080p on a 136"" screen. It is despicable that he has modified IV-VI to dovetail with the I-III horror shows."
3,What is cool?,"Aw heck, why not join in?It is simple to explain:Han Solo is the coolest character in the Star Wars Trilogy.He is cool because of his moral ambiguity.His moral ambiguity is established in the scene where he shoots Greedo FIRST.Changing that scene takes away the moral ambiguity it established, and makes him less cool.Simple, yes?It's like the scene everyone loved in Raiders of the Lost Ark, when Indy just pulls out a gun and shoots the guy with the knives, instead of getting into a protracted and cliche ""hero"" fight with him. It's a wink at the audience that says ""This guy doesn't play by the rules.""Maybe it's not what Lucas intended, but sometimes a creator's greatest achievements are the unintended ones."
1,New Version is Total Junk,Lucas...bring back the originals on DVD! Not this new crap that was retuned to match your horrible prequels.Disgusting.
1,Needs to be reiterated,"Lucas made a terrible error in judgment when he decided to make his altered versions of the movie the ONLY versions available. The ""last chance to buy the originals"" campaign years ago translates into ""no-new-dough"" for Lucas this time around.I'm 32, saw Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back in theaters about ten times each. Those movies were so exciting and fresh... it's a shame that Lucas won't leave these gems alone, or at least give us viewers a choice.But really, it's not THAT big of a shame. We do have choices in the form of other entertainment that truly does leave this series in the dust at this point."
1,Have you been Jedi Mind Tricked Lucas? Issue the originals!,"Are you stark raving mad Lucas?!? Issue the original theatrical releases of these movies on DVD as well. If you don't, you'll be totally responsible for destroying your own Star Wars legacy! You'll be synonymous with Grand Moff Tarkin's comment to Darth Vader, ""The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion."" Personally I'm not buying these DVD's. Thankfully, I have my original Star Wars Trilogy Widescreen editions on Laserdisc. So I'm not as desperate as those with VHS tapes. But I promise you that if you don't release the originals, a lot of fans like me will not purchase your media again. [***], even your friend Spielberg released his original version of E.T. along with his special editions! So for the love of the Force, listen to your fans!"
1,Boo,"Are you kidding?I was so looking forward to this release. I guess I will keep watching the worn out VHS copies I have of Star Wars. I don't know what this garbage is that's being issued on DVD, but it's not Star Wars."
1,"What does ""Original"" mean to Amazon?",The description for Star Wars: The Original Trilogy is unclear as to what is on the disks. Are you getting the original movies as we seen them in the theater or will you find the more recent altered versions. I would be happy to pay for the original trilogy with the scenes and characters as originially released. Why has finding the real versions of these films become so difficult?Please be specific as to the version in the box...they are not interchangeable...one version is classic and the other poorly considered.
5,Join The Dark Side,Lord Vaders trilogy is what this is because darth vader is in each 3 episodes this a great 4 disk set to watch after youve seen episode 3 Revenge Of The Sith Long Live Darth Vader
2,OVERRATED BUCK ROGERS,"Okay, the first movie was cute (and how anyone could be surprised by Vader's announcement in III...how obvious can you get). A movie for people who think ""whoosh"" is the sound a space ship makes in a vacuum (hint: there is NO sound in a vacuum). And if I never see an Ewok again, I'll die happy. Oh yes, finally...these are outstanding special effects???! It's matted, guys, and painfully obviously so. SWII is a waste of time, and SWIII could have been told in 30 minutes. Enough of a long winded boring series signifying nothing."
5,Of Course Star Wars is awesome!,"The movie is just like I remember it in the theater, EXCEPT Anakin Skywalker has been digitally inserted as the young Skywalker rather than the unmasked Darth Vader."
1,Disrespectful.,"i can't believe George Lucas is only releasing the ""Special Edition"" versions of these movies. He completely destroyed everything about these movies that were so great. Those out-dated effects still work today and the puppets look better than CGI effects made these movies spectacular! The fact that George wont release the original, and TRUE versions of the movies proves that he isn't an artist to respect, but more of a business man, with no respect for any of his fans or anybody that helped him put those original masterpieces together. I will not buy this set, I'll wait for the original movies which will no doubt be released a few years from now so Lucas can milk even more money from those who buy this one."
4,Why does it have to be special edition?!,"The original Star Wars, NOT the special edition, is the true art form and authentic Star Wars experience. As spectacular as the 3 films are with or without revisions, the special edition series adds unessessary footage that may help along the plot, but its still murdering what Star Wars is supposed to be.However, they still are the best Star Wars films ever made. I will buy this only because its the only set offered, but I beg Lucas to bring back the original films and put them onto DVD."
4,Great,"For those of you complaining about the extra footage being added, just shut up. George Lucas wanted these DVD's to be like the Directors Cut, previously he was unable to add the extra footage because there wasn't enough room on the VHS. Now that he has the capability of adding the shots he wanted, fans are lashing back at him.He enhanced the sounds and quality of the movies, which are much better than the original, and the extra footage he added is only space scenes and a few shots of Tatooine. Its not as if he changed the entire plot."
2,George Lucas get a life!,I'm so sick and tired that he put in new changes of Star Wars. Yes I do enjoy Star Wars very much but Lucas needs to take a break from it. He has done enough. I mean Star Wars is fine the way it is and he needs to leave it alone. I'm happy that it came on DVD and when I have money I'm going to get it and it will be sort of great to see the new scenes but he needs to retire from Star Wars and make no more of it. I hope after Episode 3 there is no more of it that it's the last Star Wars. He really needs to take a break!
3,Orwellian,"Does this constant tweaking and reworking remind anybody of Winston Smith's job in Orwell's 1984? Smith was constantly updating old news stories so that they would always reflect the current political climate. I don't mean to read some deep heavy meaning into George Lucas' reworking of these classics, but he should let people remember these movies as they were, warts and all. As for the movies themselves, what can I say that everyone doesn't already know? The movies are great and the effects were charming by today's standards, but 25+ years ago they were cutting edge."
3,Some good to it,"The one good thing about this trilogy is the picture quality. Even you hardcore fans that hate the added features must admit that. I remember back in the 80's when I was watching Star Wars on VHS how grainy it all seemed at some parts. For the most part I hated the added special effects, well I hated them all except one. Let's face it, the added scene in Jabba's palace with the aliens singing Tina Turner type songs was not only unnecessary, but downright retarded. That one, more than any other really p*ssed me off. But the one scene that I really didn't mind was at the end of Return of the Jedi, when they showed the celebration carrying on through the rest of the galaxy as opposed to just on Endor. However, I didn't approve of the addition of Hayden Christenson as the image of Anakin next to Obi Wan and Yoda. Bottom Line, buy it only if you've given up all hope that the ""real"" originals will ever be released."
1,I felt misled,"I felt misled by the description of this Blu-ray release. The product description states: ""Star Wars: The Original Trilogy on Blu-ray."" I was hoping to finally own the original trilogy on digital format, but was angered to discover these are the newer versions with distracting modifications added several years later.I would like to blame George Lucas for this swindle, or Amazon for a vague description, but I guess I only have myself to blame for not taking the time to properly research the item before pre-ordering it.I hate the changes made to these classic films. On my planet Han ALWAYS shoots first!"
1,Give us the originals,At least as a bonus disc. Why not take a queue from Blade Runner and give the VIEWER the option to choose which he likes best?!
2,Please make the REAL Star Wars movies available,"I was expecting the STAR WARS Trilogy to be available in it's original form not the 'tech revamped' version which sucks big time!The few special effects are just too 'special' to blend into the original movies... and the much talked about Jabba-Han Solo meeting segment is absolutely disastrous!I didn't buy it then (on laserdisc) and I sure won't buy it now!I guess I will have to 'retreat' to THE ultimate edition, the Laserdisc THX Box Set in CAV, THE best laserdisc I ever bought... with the fabulous box AND the photo book inside... now that is the edition I use to make my yearly non stop STAR WARS screening party at my house... anybody wanna come? LOLIt's the REAL DEAL!Don't worry about the Laserdisc cuts between sides I have three reverse LD players...Wonder B"
1,I've had it with Lucas,Why? Why don't you release Star Wars on Blu-Ray? Your greed has ruined the whole Star Wars experience for me. Are you happy? Go ahead and release a new dvd version with special packaging.PS: Please add Jar Jar to the original trilogy....He's so funny!!!
1,"This is not the ""original"" trilogy, this is a frankenstein","Hey, George, release the original theatrical releases remastered to the highest quality audio and sound with NO additional scenes, character changes, crappy 90s CGI, etc. Only then will I shell out any money for a Star Wars blu-ray."
2,HE STOLE THE VOICE FROM BUCKET HEAD!,"This is getting out of hand! I want my original Star Wars, mat pantings and all! I want Boba Fett's real voice, not a bad actors cheasy dub over! I don't want to see a digitized version of Harrison Ford's head dodge a lazer from Greedo's blaster! Hey, why don't we add Jar Jar Binks in the next release, he could be chewbacca's old friend, It would add continuity. What happened to George Lucas, he screwed up Episode 1, Episode 2, and most likely Episode 3, but why did you have to take this from everyone. Sure It's just a view changes, but it's the little things in life MAN! Common, I'm not gonna tell you it wasn't fun watching STAR WARS on DVD! It will always be one of those movies to unique to be qualified a ""movie"", well lets hope any way. Prey there are no signifigant Special effects advances within the next 10 years. I'd pay $100 for the original trilogy to be on DVD and so would 1000's of other people. JUST RELEASE THE ORIGINAL PLEASE, FOR THE FANS!"
1,Star Wars Cornball Remix... Again???,Star Wars on George Lucas' CG steroids... comedic and ridiculous. Please give us the classic original (A New Hope) on blu-ray.
1,"RELEASE REMASTERED THEATRICAL VERSIONS!!!! (1977, 1980, 1983)","The Star Wars Trilogy is one of the most amazing 3 picture films in the history of cinema. I'd like to see them in their theatrical releases with state-of-the-art picture and sound quality. No laserdisc masters. I want to see George Lucas undo what he did. Yes, correct the big error he made to his films with a large eraser!These films were treated poorly over the years starting with 1997s Special Editions and the 2004 DVD release. They do not need tweaking. Why fix something that so many fans love? I'm not against the changes, but I hate not having a choice. I want the choice to choose which version I want to see. I'm not interested in upgrading Star Wars until these versions see the light. That's just my two cents."
1,Give us the original!,"Leave it to George Lucas to create the best movie series of all time, screw it up, then tell us the only version we can buy on DVD is the messed up one! Some of the changes in the ""Special"" edition are just annoying - like putting a young Anakin at the end of ""Return of the Jedi"", but some of them totally change the film we grew up with - I'm sorry, but at the beginning of ""A New Hope"", Han was exactly the type of person who would shoot Greedo first. Why on earth would Lucas mess with that? I am a die-hard Star Wars fan, but I would rather die than pay Lucas money for this twisted version of a classic movie series!"
1,Will the true Star Wars trilogy please stand up?,"I won't be buying this farce. The '97 revisions I found totally disappointing. I don't need more changes to my Star Wars movies any more than I need deleted scenes and colorization to _Casablanca_ or dubbing to my Rudolph Valentino movies. Newer isn't always better, Mr. Lucas.In any event, how could I enjoy a movie if the things that are most noticeable are the new edits?I hope you are laughing all the way to the bank, George. Although I do wonder how you can look at yourself in the mirror after having prostituted out some great movies for nothing but your own personal gain."
1,Give us the original movies in blue ray!,"Give us the original movies in blue ray! If Lucas wants to give us his ""improved"" versions too, I can tolerate that but I want the original movie and I'm tired of Lucas not caring want the fans want."
1,Han Shot First.,I saw the original films in the theater as a child. They changed my life. I'd really love to enjoy them in HD. It's THAT simple.
3,The best films ever but where is the DVD?,"If you are as sick of pathetic,low-resolution VHS versions of the best movies,you DO have some alternative options. First,you can a used Laserdisc player for around [$$$] that blows the VHS versions away,the Trilogy usally sells for around [$$$] for all 3 Laserdiscs on E-bay,plus that Laserdisc player also comes in mighy handy for countless other films not out on DVD. Second,they are actually GOOD quality bootlegs (5-star collection) of the Trilogy on DVD,the ones i own include a 2.35:1 Widescreen letterbox (non-anamorphic) transfer mastered from the great Laserdiscs with DTS and DD 5.1 sound on dual-layered discs. The picture quality imo,is superior to the Laserdisc versions due to DVDs component video input and progressive scan. Show George Lucas what he is missing by going with one of these options and not supporting VHS,a DEAD technology."
5,"A long, long time ago....","I own the special edition box set (all three movies). I remember when I was like five years old, my dad took me to the movie theater, and introduced me to the first of the movies that later became my all time favorites....Star Wars: A New Hope (Episode IV). From that point on, I got hooked. About the special edition, the extra footage is amazing, the THX sound rocks, and it brings you back to that galaxy far, far away, like the opening was yesterday. The only bad thing is that the special edition was released only on VHS. I wish they would later release a DVD edition. FX are amazing, sound is great, picture quality is pretty good (so far), and the plot of each of the movies....well, if you don't know what I'm talking about right now, GET THE MOVIES, because you're like 20 years behind.Bottom line...classic sci-fi action movies....after all, it's STAR WARS"
2,Again?,"Well, the only reason for Lucas to re release these movies is obviously the teaser for Star Wars Episode II: As Yet Untitled. This is a big disappointment. There is no new footage or anything worth watching. We just hear from George that the new movie with have to do with the Rebuplic, and the mysterious clone wars. If you already own the trilogy, there really is no reason to buy it again. Why not release these movies on DVD? The official position from Lucasfilm is that George doesn't have the time to do the movies on DVD. Does he print them himself in his garage. This is just another example of Lucas milking it. And I doubt this will be the last release of the Star Wars trilogy on VHS."
2,bumper sticker for BluRay versions,"I got a friend who just printed up a bumper sticker saying, ""Vader's a sissy on BluRay"" with figure of Vader's head going ""Noooo"""
1,"George, GFYS","George, George, George........I want the originals - not your cartoons.These films looked GOOD because they looked REAL - now they look like S^&*Stop tinkering and release the originals - clean them up, restore them, but don't ALTER them for god's sake.Till' then, I'm going to enjoy my laserdiscs :)CIAO!"
1,Pointless,If you already own the Star Wars Trilogy collection that came out last year then this set is a complete waste of money. With the exception of the new cover and the fact that it does not have the bonus disc the original had this is the same exact collection. If you are looking to pick up the Star Wars Trilogy do yourself a favor and find the edition that was released last year. It has a bonus 4th disc filled with extras that is well worth the extra ten bucks if you are a Star Wars fan.
1,Not the original films!,I don't recommend this box simply because it's NOT the ORIGINAL films! It's a new version (2004) with new digital special effects.
2,What is this?,"For my 11th birthday I asked my parents to get me this. I was hoping for the original trilogy and not the SE but I was WRONG!Tatooine is full of unneeded things and with humor that's childish. Han solo shots after Greedo, the worst mistake. I could go on but I'll just skip to the last one. They changed Anakin's force ghost!! People say it doesn't change the story, of course it does. The movies is called RETURN of the jedi, the older force ghost represents the return of Anakin, changing it to a younger Anakin is changing the whole story of that movie. The effects are ruining the story, like the prequels. People say that kids like the new generation which is based on only effect, effects are nothing compared to a good story and good characters. Original fans aren't just old people there kids like me. And if kids respect this new generation and this dvd set, they need brain surgery."
1,Lucas is a back-stabbing megalomaniac,"Special Editions only on DVD? It's nice to see Mr. Lucas cares so much about the fans who made him a gazzillionaire.These movies changed the lives of myself and millions of others in my generation - but because of Lucas' ego (and apparent disgust for the classic versions of these films which we cherish), all we will ever have of these films are a trio of fading videocassettes and our own (now betrayed) fond memories!I, for one, will not buy these DVD's - I've contributed my last dollar to the ungrateful Mr. Lucas' evil empire..."
5,common sense,"First off, I was a kid when Star Wars came out in 1977 and have loved all three movies ever since. However, some people are so fanatical about them that any slight additions or improvements to them is sacrilege. Folks, this is the best scifi fantasy film of all time, but it's still just a movie. The best thing about these movies is the improved picture and sound. I tried viewing my old VHS tapes and they looked terrible after watching the rerelease back in 1997. The new scenes between all three movies probably clocks in at under thirty minutes so it's not really messing with the pacing and feel. Be a Star Wars fan not a fanatic purist."
1,Time to take it over the top,"Don't you just love these film makers who have such egos that they believe that their films are considered national treasures. Just like when Spielberg re-made E.T. and tossed it out into theaters and then on DVD years after it's original release and expected fans to bow down and worship.....instead, it bombed harder than pearl harbor (the event...not the horrible film). Hopefully, they same will happen here. I can't think of anything better than to see this tripe collect dust on the shelves of stores all over the world. But, I'm sure it will sell very well...geeks need something to bow down to instead of ""the ole' in out, in out"".Not the original films...so why bother?"
1,not the original versions.,"Mr. Lucas is always talking about film preservation when it comes to classic hollywood movies, yet he keeps messing around with his own! I bought this version, but i would've paid twice as much for the original versions. Ruining a classic like star wars was not enough, now he has to ruin thx 1138 by goofing around with the cgi again. At least with the Thx 1138 release though their offering both versions in a boxed set, like spieberg did with e.t. Thank god for spielberg, if it was'nt for him god knows what lucas would have done with the indiana jones trilogy with cgi. Years ago lucas talked about doing a special edition of raiders of the lost ark, a nearly perfect and flawlessly edited film, with cgi. For god's sake leave these good movies alone already. I agree with Gary Kurtz lucas just lost the touch after empire strikes back."
5,Star Wars once again,"These moves tell the tale about a young boy named Luke Skywalker which his life takes a dramatic turn when two robots are bought by his uncle. Little does Luke knew about the adventures he was about to have with his companions C3PO and R2D2. Pirates, smugglers, aliens from different parts from the galaxy along with fantastic special effetcs fill out one of the most dramatic movies in history."
1,WHY?!?,"I miss the Yub-Yub song!!! George Lucas, why'd you torment me with this new ""original"" version? I will never buy it until the original is released!"
1,the dark side clouds EVERYTHING,"Lucas continues to amaze his loyal fans with constant modifications to the original trilogies...wow George you've done it again...don't waste your time with this garbage...hey George, put the ORIGINAL trilogy released in theater on dvd...not your messed up, twisted, dark side modifications on dvd. Lucas doesn't care about the loyal fans of the original trilogy - that much is clear...the dark side surrounds Lucas...beware of the dark side! don't give in to hate...that can lead to the dark side of the Force! If I had an option to give this travesty a zero or even negative stars I would...I'll stick with my original VHS tapes and ignore these pieces of trash DVDs."
1,"Thanks Lua$, but no thanks!","Here's what this new box set will contain. It's basically the three discs from the 2004 box set, except that this three-disc set does not include the fourth disc of bonus materials. A limited edition box set that doesn't have any extras? Sadly, yes. For those who are wondering, this box set contains the 2004 special editions of the films. Don't be tricked! Buy the 2004 box set if you want the Star Wars trilogy on DVD!Disc 1:FeatureCommentary by George Lucas, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren and Carrie FisherEaster Egg - Credit RollDisc 2:FeatureCommentary by George Lucas, Irvin Kershner, Lawrence Kasdan, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren and Carrie FisherEaster Egg - Credit RollDisc 3:FeatureCommentary by George Lucas, Lawrence Kasdan, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren and Carrie FisherEaster Egg - Credit Roll"
1,Big Mistake on Lucas's past,"When Lucas first created the Star Wars concept it was ostensibly an homage to the movies of the past. How unfortunate that when releasing the DVD versions of these films he's not taking into account the nostaglia we original viewers felt at seeing the movies as they were first released. Having seen the ""updated versions"" of the films all the new footage did was detract from the ""nostalgia"" of the originals. I wouldn't accept the new versions as a gift and I certainly wouldn't pay for them. Sorry George... you're not getting a penny of mu money until you release the original versions on DVD."
1,"Taking bets on how long before ""unaltered"" versions hit Blu Ray","As much as I have a distaste for Lucas over the last 14 years (since that first abomination of a ""Special Edition"" came out)..I have to think that FOX is just as guilty of tapping the well here.Case in point...Look how Aliens blu ray was handled. Initially an expensive set with basically the same special features as the two-disc special editions from 2003 or so...only to release the individual films on blu ray 9 months later...with NO special features.I would almost be willing to bet money that the ""original"" versions will hit blu ray in a year. Even then...I will never give Lucas another dime of my money ever again."
1,vote for theatrical release,"I too will cast my review as a vote for the original theatrical release instead of these reworked versions. Every work of art has flaws, but no true artist will ever go back and try to redo the original. Every time you alter a work of art by adding or changing, you lose something of what made it a great work of art to begin with."
3,The Ghost of Sebastian Shaw is not happy!,"Of course, I would love to see the original trilogy on blu ray. But I didn't mind SOME of the changes Lucas made - until I saw Hayden Christensen standing in the place of Sebastian Shaw at the end of Return of the Jedi. That ruins the entire trilogy for me!And I think the latest trilogy (episodes I-III) was simply Lucas' transition into producing cartoons (i.e. Clone Wars). But hey, what can we do, it's his baby, not ours (just like politicians will do what they want, regardless of what ""we the people"" want)."
3,Greatest Space Saga Ever!,Beautiful package set. Quality material. Gave it a 3 because Lucas changed the ending to Jedi so it matched with the prequels. What a jerk!
3,A time honored classic,I have been waiting to get this on DVD for a while. The scenes are remastered and the sound is excellent along with the effects. The shortfall is they changed some of the scenes so this set is not as I remember the original. If you can get over some added scenes and changed endings then you will enjoy this DVD set.
1,Not the original trilogy,I can't believe this is being advertised as the original trilogy? What about the original films I grew up watching?
1,"Umm,not worth the time to watch or your money",the sound and picture are all great but the movie is a mutation of the original.These arent the movies people loved when they first came out.I only saw Star Wars around 1990 when I was 8 years old.I loved it then.It became my favorite movie.I was in line for the special editions because I so badly wanted to see them on theater big screen.Though the additions to those movies werent needed or liked by me I still loved Star Wars.I found the laser disc editions of the original versions and they are better than these dvd's.I wont buy these dvds.I say you shouldnt either.Send a message to George and make it clear we dont want to see his best movies turned into promotional material for the horrible prequel movies.Whats the reason to add characters from the prequel to these movies?Like I said its just to promote his new movies.(...)
1,No thank you,"I would rather have a choice of which version of these films to watch. Lucas says the original versions ""don't exist"". Really? I seem to remember watching them many times as a child. I know my parents spent quite a bit of money for me to do so. But... they don't exist. Does this mean my parents get their money back?Hey George: you may have built the Empire, but we paid for it. The least you could do is let us decide which version is best..."
1,"Originals please, George.","I'm really hoping that George is not that stupid and KNOWS that his biggest fans with the most disposable income want the original versions. Also, Lucas has an ENORMOUS ego, and is his own biggest fanboy. If anybody wants to see the originals in glorious BluRay HD, it's Georgie-Boy. Deep down, G. wants to sit back and say, ""Look what I did, WAY BACK IN 1977!!! ISN'T IT PRETTY?!?""At least, I really hope he does..."
1,It's just wrong,"So I'm not the first to say this, and I won't be the last. WHY GEORGE WHY????????!!!!!!! Why destroy what was perfect? And it wasn't bad enough to rape the originals once, now he has to release a bastardized version of the bastardized versions. I'm sick, so I have to see the dvd versions, but I sure won't buy them. Mr Lucas, I'm sure you will never see this review, but if by some strange turn of events you do, why not just release two versions, the one you f**ked up, and the real, original one. You'll have the rare pleasure of making millions by selling actual $h!t, and you can at the same time double that by selling something that defined a generation as well. Release the originals also! Realistically, I'm going to have to dub the vhs onto dvd myself, and pretend this never happened."
2,"OK, but not as good as the original","This is a pretty good kid's flick, OK summer-action-movie fare. You know, chase scenes, cute stuffed-animal characters, scary sharp-toothed monsters, shootouts, etc. I just think they deviated a little to far from the original plot, shown on TV as ""Battlestar Galactica."" The special effects are better, but the writing and acting are not. I'm not sure why modern writers and directors don't feel like they can make a re-make without ""modernizing"" it with trendy issues. For example, Lucas (the director) for some reason felt compelled to insert a whole homoerotic subtext with Luke and Han that was just not there in ""Battlestar."" If you have not seen the original, you might enjoy this more than I did."
4,Star Wars Franchise Deserve Better Than Blu-Ray,Lucas knows what is best for the Star Wars franchise and it is not Blu-Ray DVD .The Technology has it's problems that has yet to be worked out .Scream all you want Blu-Ray fanboys it ain't gonna happen not any time in the near future .May the force be with you !
2,LIKE A GAY RAVE PARTY,LUKE AND DARTH HAVE GLOWSTICKS AND THERE ARE MUPPETS ALL AROUND AND LUCAS IS A WEIRDO WHY THESE MOVIES ARE POPYULAR I DUNNO BUT JSUT LOOK AT LIKE 20BILLION REVIEWS OH WELL I THIUHK THEYRE STUPIDE BUT I JUST LIKET TIO ZOOM IN ON LEIA IN CHANES THATS WHY 2 STARS OTHERWISE DUMB DONT BYE RENT IT
1,Same complaint... not originals. so sad!,"So after some investigating I also finally realized you cant get the original theatrical versions on Blu-ray. Whatever reason lucas films has, or whoever it is that is robbing us, BOOOOOOOOOOO on you. I read somewhere they just dont want to invest the money in cleaning the original negatives, or possibly some originals were altered in making the special editions. What a nightmare."
1,RIP OFF!!!,"This has got to be the biggest travisty in the history of DVD. THE SAME DISCS AS THE LAST RELEASE?!! In a new fancy box? Minus one disc? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GEORGE!? I was under the impression that these would be the long awaited Originals. But NOOO! I bought it and now i'm mad. I'm stuck with this horrible ""new"" box set, and now i cannot return it, because the store i bought it at has a strict policy about opened DVD's. can't the stores make one DVD an exception, this ""new"" box set? IT'S THE SAME THING AS LAST YEAR!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
2,WOW,"What a big contraversy, hey, folks? The problem is, I follow what Lucas does, but talk about &*@#ing the trilogy. Greedo shoots first, and Han is a KEN DOLL in that part. Its so FAKE. Now, I would have minded tis if:-George Lucas INVISIONED this.-An original version of the trilogy was available, so I dont have to look at the new whiney Aniken at the end of 'Jedi'.-They did at least a LITTLE better on the effects.But, hey, at least Leah is still in her metal bakinni in 'Jedi'. Yow. Nothing wrong there, eh?Honestly, Lucas. The only thing that does this NEW trilogy justice is the new movies (which are mediocre) and the bonus DVD Without them Lucas would havenever *&%$ed with it. Other that that its OKAY..."
1,"no, no, no...","once upon a time, in a movie theatre far away, there were these three amzing films that spoke volumes to millions.with the release of the ""special"" editions, those films are gone.should there be a special edition of picasso's ""guernica""? should there be a special edition of the constituion? do we need a special edition of ""dark side of the moon""?now, all we have are the grossly mediocre prequels. i used to be such a star wars junkie, toys, posters, shirts, vhs... i've broken free. no ""episode III' for me, no more shelling out cash for lucas' spoiled-brat ""vision"".these films belong to you, me, everyone, not just georgie lucas... i feel bad he felt the need to reach into our wallets as opposed to reaching into our hearts."
1,Don't bother.,"Whooossshhh! That is the sound of a series I once loved being flushed down the toilet like the turd it has become. George Lucas destroyed this beloved series when he redid the effects and altered scenes. You never, never, NEVER mess with a classic. My advice, don't bother with this DVD set. Stick with the VHS tapes you bought before Lucas went insane. Maybe the low sales of the DVDs will persuade Lucas to release the original versions on DVD."
1,This is getting old...,"Add one more to the count of people who won't be buying this without the original theatrical releases. The more time goes by, the more it is becoming readily apparent Mr. Lucas just got lucky with the original trilogy. It says a lot about someone's ego to spit in the face of all his fans for 15+ years. What a schmuck."
1,Buyer beware.,"Let's hope Lucas changes his tune and includes the original versions at the last minute... maybe that's his plan... get the average joe excited about the DVDs, and then turn the rest of the fans rabid with an announcement a couple of weeks before the DVD release date.Give me wires over bad CGI any day. I won't watch these DVDs, rent them, or accept them as a gift. I'll make due with the laserdiscs, and if they wear out, I think I've got the Little Golden Books with accompanying 45RPM records in the basement..."
5,No original = no purchase???,"I don't get all you people out there that say you won't buy the Star Wars trilogy on DVD because it doesn't contain the original versions, only the special editions. So, for a few minutes in each movie that you don't like you'll give up:-Better picture-Better audio and,-A format that will not deteriorateIf I stayed away from every movie that had a few minutes I didn't like, I wouldn't own any movies. Saying you wont buy the movie at all because a few scenes have changed is the stupidest argument I have heard. And waiting until the originals are available is even worse...THEY WILL NEVER BE AVAILABLE. Give it up. Put up or shut up. I think we're all sick of listening to all the whining. I'd prefer the originals myself, but I'd rather have the special eds on DVD than not at all..."
5,A Classic,"As we all know, Star Wars is great for the nostalgic film fan, or for the first time viewer. Can't go wrong."
5,Great blue ray,What can I say? WOW picture color all way better than original VHS or DVD very impressed. Great DVD set. A must own!
2,Not a fan,"I watched the trilogy just to watch it since everyone has been telling me for years that I simply had to see it. Well I did and I wasn't surprised that I didn't like it. I'm sure it was an awesome thing when it came out, I can just imagine. However, I found it pretty cheesy. I cant even explain it. It was boring to me, none of the characters interested me, except Darth Vader. The one good thing this trilogy has going for it, is the score. Its truly magnificant. I really do love that aspect of it. However, the movies themselves will remain barely decent to me."
1,Never,"I have a new hope that George is reading this (or his lackeys).NEVER will I purchase this DVD set. It's simple, you can't re-write history. It's Star Wars, not A New Hope, no Jabba, no Rontos, no crap!NEVERI'll buy a laserdisc player first, then purchase the digital edition of the unaltered trilogy.Rack me up as just another fan of the films sans revisionism.-J Ashley"
1,Horrible changes,"I don't understand why these changes were made. All I want to do is find a copy of the remastered editions of the original trilogy, but they don't exist. WHY? Hayden Christianson was two when Return of the Jedi came out. Why is he in this?"
1,Thank God...,"Thank God George Lucas doesn't control the rights to classics like Gone With the Wind, 2001 a space odyssey, Casablanca or Jaws. We'd never again get to see these masterworks the way audiences came to love them during their first runs in theatres. And as to the first 3 Star Wars movies (skip the others) I'm content to replay them in my memory. No Star Wars redoes for me Mr. Lucas... even if they are on Blu-ray."
5,Me again.....Always wanting better Stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Why. Just make Star Wars Complete Box-set. Put Star Wars EpisodesI, II, III, IV, V, VI + Star Wars IV-VI Bonus Disc and Star Wars Clone Wars. Volumes 1 and 2.Anyway. Bye"
4,There's always the VHS tapes,"For those who don't like the new ""improved"" versions of the saga, there are always the VHS tapes. If you didn't purchase them without the 97 changes, you may still be able to find them on ebay or elsewhere.I personally don't mind these new editions, except for the obvious discrepancies listed by others. However, I am with most people and would like to see the original on DVD minus all new ""enhancements.""Enhancements really don't sell that well by their own merit. Take the Alien movie that was released recently (last year?) Didn't do very well. Gibson's Passion redux - ??? Some of these movies just don't need redone. PLEASE - leave them alone. What's next, Indiana Jones get's CGI and adds a tiger running after Ford in the opening scene of the movie (instead of the huge boulder)?!?"
1,Originals please.,"One star because George will not release the original theatrical version. Complete crap. Don't want CGI ""enhancements"" and changes that make the original trilogy more like the prequel trilogy (i.e. more terrible)."
1,TOTAL CRAP,"These Blu-Rays are the ""Special"" Editions only. Total Crap. Save your money and enjoy the original theatrical releases on regular DVD from the 2-dvd movie sets."
2,I'm waiting for the criterion edition,"Just a rumour, but if it's true a criterion version of the ""original"" Star Wars might be out. Some disadvantages would be that only 'A New Hope' would come out; this is because it's was one of the most important films for too many reasons to comment here, but that I'm sure every fan will know anyway. Also, some people know Criterion version is a bit more costly (it will propably cost as much as the entire star wars dvd trilogy.)keep your fingers crossed and hopefully Mr. Lucas will fight the dark side and make it happen."
1,Don't by this if you are in Australia,I have an all region DVD player and these will not play. Don't waste your money.
1,Milking it!!,Pointless! since 2004 - 2006 there will be 3 verions of these films. not to mention release in 3D and release in 2007 for 30 years of star wars. i WAS a big fan but George Lucas is just milking star wars. Just stick to one set. i wont be buying these because i know if i do it will be re re re re re re released time and time again. waste of money if you have a set stick to it.
4,Finally on DVD...,"Well, well, well. The Lucas Merchandising Machine finally released all three ""original"" Star Wars films out on DVD. How does it look? Pretty darned good, Lucas' crew cleaned up the film quite a bit and the sound has been digitally remastered. Looks great and sounds great.Star Wars purists may be unhappy since these are the ""new"" versions of the trilogy, not the original theatrical releases. I am just glad to have a version on DVD since my old VHS copy is barely viewable. If you ""must have"" these movies on DVD, then this collection is for you.If you don't buy this collection now, don't worry. Another version will most likely come out after the 3rd ""new"" Star Wars film is out in theatres."
1,I like the cover art.,"Seriously, how long are George Lucas and Fox going to make me wait for an unedited version of the trilogy?I don't care if there is an option to view the new changes. Actually I think that would be kind of cool. I even [gasp] liked *some* of the more subtle changes (e.g. walking dewbacks in the background of ANH). I just also want a way to NOT watch them as I think 95% of the changes are aweful.How old will I be before I can relive my childhood (but in high def)?"
2,Ummm...What? I have to watch that jazz pop number in Jedi,"Dudes and Dudettes,I am not a huge Star Wars fan and think the last 3 were pretty terrible, but growing up in the 70's and 80's, The original 3 movies had a huge impact on my adolescence. I'm confused, why did they alter the movies and why would you sell/purchase an altered movie? I don't care that they updated the sound etc but why did they add scenes in the movies? It sticks out like a sore thumb and is about as fresh as a Foghat concert. That jazz pop number in Jedi is just terrible. No thanks, makes me cringe thinking about watching the edited jedi again. I think I would rather sit on a spoon and watch jersey shore on my tivo."
5,The Best Science Ficton Movies Ever Made,"What can a star wars fan ask for, oh all three original star wars movies in a box set, well it happened. this box set is awesome. star wars is by far the best science fiction movies ever made. George Lucas is a genius. Thanks George for making such wonderful films."
2,I am soooo BUMMED!!!,"I just watched ""A New Hope"" and I am so disappointed with the poor quality of the image. Contrast way to high, lack of most image detail & color saturation. Compared to ""Empire Strikes Back"" ""ANH"" is terrible. ""ESB"" looks great though I have not watched ""Return Of The Jedi"". I am sure that it will look fine. I would like an explanation from anybody on the poor image quality. Bummed!!! One star for just the fact that I now own all three movies and One star for a poor reproduction. Why?!"
1,No,Until the original theatrical version is released I'm not even going to rent this trilogy. Better to never watch it than see those added CGI scenes and puke all over my coffee table again.
1,No thank you,"Hey Mr. Lucas - if you want my money, you'll have to give me the product I want, not the product you want. Pretty complicated stuff, huh? Since you messed up these movies, I'll be spending my money on the Alien Quadrilogy instead.Thanks for caring."
2,"""Special Edition""?! Bah! Humbug!",When I saw the price of the trilogy at less than $25.00 I was very tempted. But as soon as I read that it is the Special Edition I just couldn't bring myself to buying it. I want to see the films that I grew up with. Sorry George.
1,Will not buy,"Would I love an HD edition of the original Star Wars films? Of course. Do I want these bastardized ones with blinking ewoks and Darth Vader's inner monologue? No thanks. I think that's just awful and shameful. George Lucas, you ARE the dark side of the force."
1,"Hey, triple chin Lucas! Could you stop by the store and get some condoms? Because I'd like you to be protected when you f--k me!","By fracking god.Honestly, does George Lucas' stupidity EVER end??? I mean for fracks sake, first we got the monstrosities that were the 2006 special editions, one big error being HAYDEN CHRISTIANSEN superimposed at the end of RotJ, and now we have these 2011 editions???Honestly, does this guy have dignity-phobia or something? I was so excited when I heard the trilogy was getting a re-release n blu ray, but then it all went to naught when I heard about the idiocy that is this release having RotJ FURTHER ruined by adding the ""NOOOOOOOOO"" from the end of RotS at the end.That's it. Lucas is a tard, and I'm calling it here and now, he hates us all."
1,An altered version of Darth with new vocals? Nooooooo!,"There is no way I will purchase another box set if I only get the altered version. Sorry Georgie boy. I don't want to see the epic scene of Darth saving his son ruined with some cheesy screaming dialog. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and I hate that you change things in a trilogy that's 30 years old. Maybe you could just update the original unbastardized version to bluray?"
4,Lucas did a pretty good job in updating the film,Darth Vader's armour never looked sharper. Didn't particularly like Hayden's cameo at the end of Return of the Jedi. A good set to complete the saga after my kids had watched Episode III.
1,He's using an old Jedi Mind trick,"Just repackaging the 2004 GCI-crap fest, eh George? Nice. The box looks like it could be the holy grail we've been looking for, the un-edited theatrical release of our favorite story, but no it's not. It only LOOKS like it could be. Tricking your audiance into buying yet another enstalment of your latest ""vision?"" Shame. You are not getting another dime from me George until you release what was out there for 20 years. The ORIGINAL trilogy."
1,Geeks growing,"When the announcement was made that these ""films"" were being released on DVD, I'm sure geeks worldwide began growing. However, I don't fall for the hype, and neither should you. These are not the original films, so why buy them. How much money does Lucas need? Just make sure he doesn't get anymore of yours."
3,Lucas: un poco loco,"Do you know what happened when Kafka tried to burn his manuscripts? A friend of him stopped him and saved his work. Doesnt George Lucas has any friends? Come on, this an emergency!!! Spielberg, wherever you are, talk some sense into this guy! George: make all the new sequels, presequels, you want. Cast Britnney Spears as Han & Leia daughter, make a 12 part series of the adventures of the young Jar-jar binks, but leave our original trilogy alone!! Yes, you got that right: OUR. The memories are not just yours buddy. We deserve it, we made you rich."
2,You're a wonderful human being.,"Canceled my order. I just can't bear to watch Han Solo step on Jabba then get away with it and then call him a wonderful human being (or a close approximation). It's a stupid, redundant scene with no new exposition. It looks ugly. And it steals drama from ROTJ. I'm just not going to give George any more money until he edits this stuff out. I don't have to have the absolute originals. I like some of the digital touch-ups. But every single bit of dialog he added since 1997 should be trashed.And one more thing. Why is he continually changing the original trilogy to match the crud he delivered in the prequels. That's just plain dumb. If Star Trek II could survive Kahn's recognizing Checkov who wasn't on the Enterprise when he was, then the original trilogy could have survived the plot holes between it and the prequels.Uggh!"
1,"No originals, no sale","That's it, plain and simple. Lucasfilm can include all the extras they want and charge 10 cents and I still wouldn't buy it without the original theatrical editions of these movies. I saw ""Star Wars"" in the theater when I was 6 years old, and it blew my mind. That's the movie I want to watch again - not ""Star Wars Episode I: A New Hope: Special Edition,"" just plain old ""Star Wars."" I don't mind if the SE version is also on the disc, and I'd probably watch it if it were - after watching the original. I'd even spring for the full set of all 6 movies - even though I have no interest in the newer ones - if that were the required indulgence to gain access to plain old ""Star Wars"" and friends.Just to add some perspective, I'm not some rabid Star Wars fan who goes to conventions, dresses up, etc. I'm just a middle-aged guy who wants to see a movie he fondly remembers from his childhood."
1,"I have altered the films, pray I don't alter them anymore.","I was just about able to deal with the previous special editions. I got used to those changes and thought that's what we were getting on these discs. But after seeing the confirmation of Vader pointlessly screaming and countless other changes that were unnecessary and in some cases ruin the scene, I can't in good conscience give this man any more of my money.Here's hoping poor sales will prompt the guy to release the theatricals in high-def."
1,How difficult is to crate a delighting product for true fans?,"George Lucas definitely has a lot of things to learn from Spielberg. For example, how difficult is to make a Star Wars Blue ray like Close Encounters of the Third Kind (30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition? This blue ray is awesome! you have here all versions of Close Encounters and guess what? you have a movie glidepath where you can see all interventions from theatrical version to latest uncut/remastered movie and you can SELECT which scenes from where see and which version run... Is not that difficult... Of course, then Lucasfilm will not be able to release each other 5 years another ""Master Collection"" with 0.23 seconds more of film or something like that...Really, Star Wars is one of the greatest stories ever and original version (Episode IV to VI)are the best... How difficult is to release that for the fans?"
1,Wait for the originals,"We all love the original Star Wars movies don't we? Well most of us at least.These are not the original movies, they are tidied up versions with 'extra' scenes. The cleaning up of the special effects is effective in places, however the extra content is not.What has been done is to add ridiculous, ill-fitting CGI sequences in order to prepare us for the lamentably poor prequels. We get a daft sequence of Han-Solo talking to a CGI Jabba which looks like a college graphics project. Worst of all is the new song and dance routine in Return of the Jedi which makes Fraggle Rock look like West Side Story.A digitally remastered version of the original movies would be unmissable, these tacky cash-ins should be left in the bargain bin along with the colorised versions of Black & White classics."
4,Great price,"I bought this for my 8 yr old son birthday, and it was great! Great price, I got it in 2 days and we are both happy with our purchase. We don't care about a bonus disc."
2,beating a dead horse,"Finally on DVD...but...I won't go into lengthy detail on the changes; since there are plenty reviews here that have already done the job for me.The digital ""enhancements"" stick out like a sore thumb of course, but other things bothered me as well. Star Wars was originally a feat of innovation, and relying on cgi effects is far from the brilliance Lucas and co. were once forced to conjure.I pay close attention to sound, and I noticed that sometimes the voice overdubs, mainly on Lea's, will sound crystal clear, and some of the other characters have that muffled, 70's film quality, which I don't mind a bit. I just say do them all over or don't do them at all.Also, pay close attention to the Millennium Falcon vs. Ti-Fighters and you can see flaws around some of the Ti-Fighters as they fly around Han and Luke.It's a DVD for chrissake! I'm sure Lucas could have fit the original version in there along with the ruined version!"
1,Save your money,"As if the previous changes weren't awful enough, George Lucas has done it again. Blinking ewoks?! Are you kidding me?? For the love of god, leave these movies alone! Stop taking advantage of the fans; you don't have that many left!"
1,why???,"why would they release these hiddeous movies? why mess up a master piece with some silly cgi inserts?When they decide to release the ""ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES"" that's when I'll buy the collection, in the meantime it's a no go for me"
2,This review might be interpreted as sacrelige....,"I have seen these 3 films once and only once in their entirety. I saw them all in the theater, and I have never seen them again. I feel OK with that. I never got into these, and I don't understand why people love them so much. I'd rather watch Antonioni's trilogy of solitude, Bergman's religious trilogy, or listen to Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Trilogy. The best film Lucas made was the original THX 1138. When I saw the first film, the film broke a few times, which was more entertaining than anything on screen. Luckily, Lucas has decided to end the series, which all of us can be grateful for. These films are, however, superior to the prequels, which shows how bad the prequels are..."
2,Upset,"I'm upset about the edition os Star Wars for DVD, I expected something different.I don't see anything new in the movies when they said there was brand new images, the only new images I've seen are at the end of Episode 6: Return of the Jedi. Hayden Christensen appears instead of the actor used in the 80's, also Naboo appears in the celebration. THAT'S ALL.If you own the software of Star Wars , ""Behind the Magic"", you'll find images that George Lucas, made of Planet Tatooine and he never incluided. Except in this software.In DVD 4 it's just the story of mister Lucas and his problems, to take Star Wars to the cinemas, a story we all know. And who cares about the trailers and the making of a videogame?It could be a 5 stars pack."
4,Good Stuff,"I personaly love the Star Wars films. The never ones are a bit lame, but i must admit, i am obsessed. A Star Wars freak. I kinda grew up on them, seeing them over and over when i was little. No one can replace Harrison Ford as Han Solo, or Luke Skywalker, and Yoda is much quarkier in the older movies. Its basic Sci-Fi action that is irreplaceable. But George Lucas needs to make his newer ones more interesting!"
1,Just say NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"Of all the changes George Lucas has made to Star Wars over the last two decades, putting the stink of the prequels in Return of the Jedi's pivotal scene is the last straw. If you care at all about artistic integrity, you will boycott Star Wars on Blu-Ray. Cancel any and all preorders. Hit Lucas in the only place he can feel it: his pocketbook."
3,Apparently he's forgotten,"I have not purchased this trilogy on DVD and I will not. Mr. Lucas either has forgotten, or does not respect the people that flocked to the theatres and made him the zillionaire he is today. I do not begrudge the special editions to anyone who loves them and wishes to purchase them, but I will never, ever understand why Mr. Lucas refuses to release these movies as they were originally shown. I'd be willing to bet that Stephen Spielberg would never disrespect the fans of his movies this way. Of course he wouldn't, that's why I have all three original Indiana Jones movies in my DVD collection.This review is being edited because Mr. Lucas did release the true originals for DVD and I am now a proud possessor of all three. My other thoughts remain the same which is why I will not purchase the movies in Blu-Ray. I'm a little sorry about that too. Perhaps one of these days the originals will be on Blu-Ray for us purists. One can hope."
4,The Watered Down Special Edition,"This is the Special Edition version, not the Original classics as we saw 20 years ago. I have mixed views towards the Special Editions. I like some stuff, like the pan galactic celebration in Jedi, and getting to see more of cloud city in Empire. But I thought Jabba looked too CGI, and Greedo does NOT fire first, period. The films were just fine. Did we really need this? Anyway, I wish they'd put out the Originals, I've heard that Mr. Lucas is destroying all the original prints of the trilogy so that the only version left is the Special Edition. Perhaps we'll see it on DVD someday?"
5,Best movie of all time!,"Star Wars-Just the name brings the senses in your mind flying. In my opinion the best movies of all time, it has everything you want in a good movie:Action, romance, excitement, danger and adventure. These elements are rarely found all together in a single film franchise and if they are it is usually put together very badly. For adults this takes them back to their childhood years, pretending to play games like cowboys and indians, I mean tell me someone who has watched star wars and not pretended to have lightsabre fights with their little brother, and for the kids these movies give them a sense of adventure inside. These three movies are the best of all time. Trust me if you haven't seen star wars already you might as well order this now, you will want to watch it again and again."
1,"If it doesnt have the original trilogy, i wont buy it!!!","I will not buy this set if it does not include the original trilogy! You want to make a lot of money mr. lucas, GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT!!"
3,The Star Wars Tragedy,"It's a shame that George Lucas has tampered with a true masterpiece. I have to agree with the other reviews, especially with the person who mentioned the analogy about the Mona Lisa. How could he ruin such perfection? Well he did. Once again in a Jar Jar Binks effort he has changed lines, watered down the true ""dark"" feel of the originals, and has tried to make Han Solo look pure ""vanilla"". How could he have changed the bar scene by not having Solo show his true aggression by striking first? My suggestion is that you try and get the originals on Laser Disc on E-Bay. Mr. Lucas has completely written off the very individuals like myself who got this whole ship off the ground back in 1977. Without us ther wouldn't have been a phenomenon. Oh by the way I have heard that in the new release Darth Vader only appears for two minutes at the end of the film. Can you believe it? May be he'll bring back Jar Jar and have him turn to the Dark Side. Good grief. Take care."
1,Add me to the disgruntled,G Lucas should release the originals without the horrible add ons and edits so that we can see these movies the way they were released originally. Especially bad - 1) the edited Greedo scene 2) the added Jaba scene in the original 3) all those stupid CGI monsters especially roaming around the cantina that did not need to be added 4)changing the song in Return of the Jedi 5) adding more monsters in the Return of the Jedi Jaba scene looking like some cheap 3D movie. Terrible!
4,The Best DVD Ever?,"Star Wars, one of the best movies of all time! Yes I loved the original trilogy. I've watched them so many times, I can remember most of the dialog. That's why, when I saw that the trilogy was going to come to DVD I had to get them. After I got the set and watched the movies, I was..... Well let's just say, ""George, did you have to mess with a masterpiece?"".George Lucus is a great movie maker, but why change so many parts of the original. In ROTJ, the ending was changed. I don't think changing Anakin to a different actor was needed. And what's up with the music? Expect to see a lot of new CGI.I guess I could go on and on, but I won't. Let's just pray that nothing else get's changed 10 years from now."
2,"cold and ""perfect""","I got these movies a week early so here's my review. These movies look brand new -- there's a digital perfection to every image. The downside is... there's very little emotion and nothing to engage you. While the effects are startling, the digitized colors feel both rich and fake at the same time. They don't ""feel"" like the movies I've grown to love.The new scenes -- Lucas has destroyed the finale of jedi with new bad special edition music and having Luke looking on a ghost father younger than himself (Hayden Christensin), which makes very little sense. The new fast cutting of the final ewok village detracts from the reunion of friends who have made it through thick and thin.To his credit he fixed the bad jabba in star wars and got rid of the dumb scream in empire when luke tumbles down the vortex at Bespin.But these movies have lost the fundamental emotion Lucas created. Let's hope he puts the originals on DVD's."
5,Spectacular,"I have the laser disc set that is much sought after as well as the DVD version.This version is spectacular...very high dynamic color range, digital removal of matte issues, high contrast and anabsolutely stunning soundtrack...you will see and hear things anew.I find the changes a minor irritant. Coming back to this trilogy with a high end theater setup and this blu ray set is nothing short of a revelation."
1,Star Wars was great. This isn't Star Wars,Star Wars was great. The Empire Strikes back was great. Return of the Jedi was great. The new Blu Ray release doesn't include the original films - only the versions that have been cartoonized. Don't buy it.
1,Not the original version,"Just to reiterate, this is not the original version, this is the edited (...) version. Plot points have been changed and you lose the history of this great movie. Yes, the CGI is better but you will never see the work that won oscars for Best Art and Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. That is a travesty. Boycott this version and hope that Lucas comes to his senses and releases the REAL Star Wars trilogy."
4,Best Trilogy of all time! Why couldn't Lucas leave it alone?,"Lucas had to tinker with the best sci fi series ever made. Sure it is his right and privilege because they are his movies, but i think his piddling made them a bit worse. Some of the new graphical changes were good but some just look out of place such as the young Anakin Skywalker at the End of Return of the Jedi. Great Series if only it had been left alone! However, its now on dvd and that is something to be thankful for."
3,"it's not bad, but it ain't the same","if i have never seen the original version, then whatever change george lucas made to the star wars trilogy would have gone unoticed by me. i cannot say that, as is, the modified version of the star wars trilogy is not as good as the original, but they are just different. would you be happy, if citizen kane and casablanca were updated with newly shot footages, then have the movie company telling you that the original versions are no longer available?i give it a three, even though i can think of ways to call it a 5 or even an 1. anyway, i am just glad that i have the perfect edition boxset of the original star wars trilogy on laser disc. the only thing that i worry about now is that i may not be able to get a new laser disc player, the next time i need one."
2,Lucas has issues,"It would have been just awesome to have the original versions of these classics on DVD along with the 1997 special edition and the 2004 edition, but, alas George Lucas has to have things absolutely new and in his way. I hate the fact that the only way for me to see the original versions of these three SciFi landmarks is to see an old, damaged, crappy VHS at a rental store that some Psycho(like George Lucas) tore apart. The only thing that I have left to say is at least Gene Roddenberry left Star Trek alone and didn't screw it up like George Lucas did. This brings me to the conclusion that STAR TREK IS MUCH BETTER THAN STAR WARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"No retouches, please!","If you like the edits Lucas made to this classic trilogy, then you can upgrade my review by one or two stars. If you agree that he should have left them alone, then I think 3 stars is fair:I have little to add to what other reviewers have said, other than that while George has the right to remake the original movies, it would be nice to buy the original releases. I enjoyed the original films immensely, and agree that although the technology was not up today's standards, they possessed a certain charm in spite of, or because of, that. I was going to buy the DVD set of the movies to replace my VHS tapes, but have realized that unless Lucas decides to release the original footage without his ""improvements,"" I really am not interested in owning them."
2,I WANT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS!,"how i can review a product not yet released?simple: i alredy own the Films (original and SE-Edition)and i definitely prefer the originals!therefore, only two stars for the missed opportunity to correct the error made with the dvd--releases.the se-edition is ok - in a way. as special feature or bonus-material. but the reason one buys a blu-ray (or dvd, or vhs, or laserdisc...) is he/she wants the experience he/she had in the cinema.arguably,the se-versions are entertaining films (espcially for those not knowing the originals) and there is a point for bringing the top-quality versions on a medium like blu-ry, hence the two stars.since this releas most likely rules out a release oft the TRUE triology in the near future, no more than two stars can be awarded."
2,These are not reviews,"This space is for viewer-written reviews of a DVD set, not a message board for Star Wars geeks to engage in flame wars. I can't believe Amazon is letting this go on.My review:As I have not seen these films as they are to be released, I can't comment on the quality.As someone who saw the original films, I give two stars to this version of the trilogy. The original films had great special effects for their time, a fast pace, and engaging characters. They also had some several very bad actors in key roles, mediocre dialogue, and numerous continuity errors, both within the individual films and over the course of the series. I personally found them a bit boring, but would recommend them for fans of space fantasy. The movies as originally released deserve 3 stars, but I took one away due to the director's revisionism."
3,On the fence about this version,I wish I had known that George Lucas had made MORE changes to this DVD boxed set. While the changes are not that extreme (some of them you wouldn't notice unless you're a huge fan) I feel that the redubbing and re-recording of scenes with the new actors from the prequels does a discredit to the people who originally played those rolls. Where would it end? Why not cut out the muppet Yoda completely and add in the CGI Yoda instead? Why not rerecord all of Obi-Wans scenes with Ewan McGregor? George Lucas should release either the original movies (not special editions) on DVD or just the special editions on DVD without the redubs and add-ins. Also put warnings on the boxed sets that lets people know they are not getting the originals or the special editions but the messed around with special editions.
4,Great Set,"I love these movies. I saw them when the opened in the theater. And am happy that this set is a Widescreen release. These are a must see. I enjoyed the bonus features. Enhanced graphics and sound editing was done to clean up and extend the movies.Now the reason I gave the movies a 4 star instead of 5. The box says Star Wars Trilogy. I thought I was buying them as they were released in the theater. Do not get me wrong, these are good movies. But it is not what I thought I was buying. These go beyond just the added scenes Mr. Lucas added in the earlier extended versions he released. He has actually created new scenes that never existed and added them. As well as re-wrote some dialogue. Yes I may sound like a purest, but I am not. I just think that the set should have been marked appropriately. Now that you know, you can make an informed decision on whether or not to purchase. But you must see these regardless."
3,Great movies... mediocre quality print,"Watching these DVDs on my plasma, I was disappointed to find the kind of compression artifacts you see in some older cheaply made DVDs. Also, the print seems to be on the dark side (no pun intended) and the shadows fall very flat and opaque. I have a nagging suspicion that Lucas did this on purpose so he can release a ""newly remastered"" version of higher quality later on.Otherwise, I'm happy with the set. The movies are still great, even if a few of the new additional edits are gratuitous."
3,a bit disappointed,This was the first time my 5 year old son was ever exposed to Star Wars Trilogy and the first casette of the three has nothing on it. That was very disappointing for him and me.The other two seemed ok.
3,I'm impressed,"No, impressed doesn't quite cover it. I'm AMAZED by the number of ""reviews"" of this DVD collection. I mean, it's remarkable when you consider the fact that a review usually presupposes having viewed the material in question that so many people have access to a DVD collection that doesn't come out until September 21, 2004. I understand that many people are very vocal about their like or dislike of the Star Wars Special Edition, and both positions are equally valid, but nothing posted here qualifies as a ""review"" unless you own or otherwise have access to the product you are reviewing. The DVD set includes bonus features, documentaries, an Episode III preview, and a video game preview that no one could possibly have already viewed, so please, stop ""reviewing"" this product."
3,Wish it were the original versions,"I remember first seeing Star Wars in the theatres when they first came out. I saw them again when they were re-released with ""new"" footage. I also remember being put off about how they changed scenes and added completely irrelevent scenes and even scenes that, imho, actually serve to detract from the film (such as the scene in episode 4 with Solo and Jabba in the hanger).I wish Lucas put the original version on DVD instead of the ""new"" version, however, better the new version than none at all, hence the three stars. An original version, or better yet, some sort of option to add the ""improved"" scenes or omit them in favor of original footage would have rated this set as 5 stars.Those who have never seen the original version would find this set as 5 stars, however. I recommend it only on the basis that there is no original version of the original trilogy."
1,Film Preservation Matters,"Lucas shows great disdain for all the hardworking, creative people who made his original trilogy possible when he plasters over their efforts with his shoddy CGI. Film historians work their hearts out, trying to restore classic films that have deteriorated over the years, and what does Lucas do? He sprays graffiti all over his own work. Very sad. A slap in the face to fans and creative people alike. Bring back the originals, Lucas! Do the right thing!"
4,"Classic films, waiting for Han to Shoot First",This series is always going to be some of the best films to me since I grew up with them. I just wish we had the uncut versions available as well.
3,Yet another collection . . .,"I'm tired of buying these same movies over and over. Videotape, DVD, Special Edition DVD, Blu Ray . . . how long will George Lucas continue milking this cow? I would prefer he leave the classics alone without fiddling with them, but he can feel free to completely alter the horrendously bad prequel movies. These original movies, in my mind, are the only true Star Wars movies. They're not perfect--Lucas tended to get carried away with the creatures, many of which looked cartoonish--but the basic story that is woven through these originals is perfectly laid out. What's interesting is that Lucas keeps altering these movies because he said the technology didn't exist when the originals were made, but that's not really why people love the movies. If that were the case, the prequels, which featured many special effects, would have a greater following."
2,Special Effects additions,"These are not the Star Wars movies I recall from my youth, 30 years ago, with characters that have been modified, to show off the latest special effects I presume, or are introduced too early into the plot. These new scenes were not even added as a bonus track to watch at the end of the shows. I have not found an option to delete them like with Jabba in episode IV which I will do so in a heartbeat. The new additions at the end of episode VI are tolerable in that it will not ruin the plot if I miss the scenes. I always considered myself to be a big SW fan but i'm very disappointed they ruined a perfectly good thing."
3,How about everybody returns their copy back to Lucas?,"I have been a Star Wars fan (not fanatic) since I was 6 years old. I can't believe the total disregard that George Lucas has for his actors, especially Sebastian Shaw (last seen on ROTJ).I think that if we are unhappy with the changes on this trilogy, we should return the copy back to George Lucas and write him a letter to tell him (as someone said) ""Lay down the mouse and step away from the computer.""PD: Hayden Christensen is as bad an actor as Keanu Reeves. :DThe only good thing about this revised film, is the picture and sound quality."
5,Excellent!,"I just got through viewing Star Wars (A New Hope) on DVD, and it looks tremendous. Say what you will about the Special Editions (the changes don't really bother me), the quality of this film on DVD (and remember its from original 1977 film stock) is outstanding and looks like it was practically shot yesterday. It feels like you're viewing a whole new movie. Any one who owns a DVD player should purchase these films, because these films are a piece of history. These Star Wars 'purists' need to relax. If you want to view the original films, I'm sure you can find some VHS cassettes out there. Remember, like a previous reviewer said, these are George Lucas's films, and he has every right to alter them if he so desires. You may not like it, but you have to respect it. The changes don't bother me, and in some areas actually do enhance the films. Now lets hope Episode 3 can bridge the gap, redeem the first two prequels, and create some sort of continuity for the entire saga."
4,perfect christmas gitf,"my son is a star wars fan 2nd generation, and was absolutley delighted to recieve this for his christmas present"
1,Star Wars,"I loved star wars growing up. I spent alot of money as a kid to get all the cool toys. And like many my age was less than impressed when i saw episodes 1 2 & 3. Is there such a thing as dictatorship in the film industry... Or even an EVIL EMPIRE?Well if there is one, and anyone reading this can slightly agree. How come he staggers release dates, only remasters new version without updating the orignal with cleaned up video and sound? Pioneering the THX standard, however makes us watch the modified version he wants us too. Well I lost interest, who the f cares anymore George! Are you happy you made Han solo to be a good guy instead of the misguided hero we came to love. George or I should say DARTH LUCAS reread the hero's journey. This late release date reminds me of the disney marketing. George Lucas you killed star wars with your greed... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
2,Looks horrible.,"Mind you I'm only half way through A New Hope but I'm so far stunned in almost every scene by how dark the blacks are. Compared to the DVD version it seems that colors that were at 85% dark are now 100% black and anything that was 60 to 80% dark is now 90% dark. So many details are just lost to the void. Unacceptable. I'll gladly go back to the so-so image quality of the old DVD, at least then I'll see something!"
1,Incomplete!,These films are clearly unfinished!!!! Lucas can't expect me to pay good money for this slipshod rushed out set of films. How he hasn't taken the time to fix every detail that must clearly be bothering him about these half films is beyond me. GET TO WORK YOU BULLFROG LOOKING BUM!
2,George Lucas can't you stop!,"Why, o why can't Lucas film just put on dvd the films as they were originaly realised.The special effect that use CGI in this film are not of top quality. Plus even with the best CGI shots you can't carry the illusion of reality for very long. Look at the LOTR films, yes they have CGI but they also use extensive models, simple camera tricks and they work infinitly better than any of the added garbage you will find in this new versions.When there finished Killing the franchise maybe they will listen to the fans."
1,Original Trilogy? Lies! Lies! Lies! .....,"I guess I should have checked out some websites or reviews of this DVD set before I bought it, but unfortunately I failed to do so.I was so excited to see that finally, the Star Wars Original Trilogy (as they call it) was on DVD for everyone to enjoy. But when I bought the DVD and brought it home to my family, we were horrified to find that these were not the wonderful movies we remembered at all, but the awful 1997 Special Edition versions with even more awfulness added in.Needless to say I returned the set immediately and got a full refund. Calling these mockeries of Star Wars the ORIGINALS is an outright lie and total false advertising. Who does Lucas think he's fooling here? He may have tricked me into buying these DVD's once from the cover's false facades, but everyone, even I, know this is not the original trilogy."
5,Who can resist? Honestly!,"Special Editions or not, these films are the pinnacle of most people's cinema experience. Seriously, does a few minutes/seconds of changes/tweaks ruin something this special?! These movies are what DVD was made for and I for one can't wait! 'Empire' alone is worth three times the price of this timeless set! So-called 'purists' resisting this out of pride or whatever, do yourself a favor and drop your pride and your wallet in September. Your DVD player will thank you."
1,These aren't the movies I grew up with.,"I grew up watching Star Wars, but these aren't the movies I grew up watching. George Lucas has, for some reason completely inexpicable, significantly changed the films for this release. The changes unnecessary and often change the characters and flow of the films significantly. If he releases the movies I grew up with, I'm sure I'll purchase them, but I have no desire to watch these versions of the films."
3,the ad says 'first time on dvd',"Why it says 'first time' and not 'FINALLY on dvd'?... Because...there will be another set of these movies. simple as that. A more definitive set of star wars original trilogy(the set which those who feel let down with the current set will love). that means those who bought this current set will have to buy another one someday. so what exactly did we just buy here?.. just a promotional dvd set to heat up the anticipation for upcoming summer movie.Major star wars fans surely dont consider themselves own the whole nostalgic phenomenon if they only have these version of the series on DVD.And true collectors shouldnt dismiss the original 1977's version,the ACTUAL product which won 7 Academy Awards."
1,"PLEASE Release the Theatrical Versions, Mr. Lucas","I am not here to whine or complain about how much I hate the Special Editions. For the Star Wars fans that prefer those versions, you will soon have them in HD quality on Blu Ray. Unfortunately for the rest of us, we have still not received OUR preferred versions in a QUALITY format (And no, the 2006 DVD's do NOT cut it).Let Mr. Lucas know that we want the theatrical versions on Blu Ray by posting your own review of the Star Wars Original Trilogy."
2,"If you change it, change EVERYTHING!","OK, so Lucas decided to dub in Hayden Christensen in Episode VI as Vader's ""ghost"" (wearing the world's worst fake beard). Lucas wants to make his ""vision"" conform. Fine, then how about going back to Episodes IV - VI and making Vader about three inches shorter so he more accurately resembles the comparatively tiny Christensen?"
1,Terrible Presentation of Classic Trilogy,"I'm sure everyone is aware by now that this DVD release is a for ""special"" editions only. Various scenes have been added, deleted, and/or redone. Most of the changes made to these films are in poor taste and do not add anything worthwhile to the original editions. I am very disappointed with this DVD release and hope that George Lucas will rethink his attitude regarding releasing these movies in their original format. I hope that my children will one day have the opportunity to see these films the way they were originally released. Big thumbs down to these ""new"" editions. They are a novelty at best."
1,Rehashed,"If you're thinking about buying these discs, DON'T DO IT.The film quality isn't that good, the color timing is all wrong, and some of the additional effects are just weird. Darth Vader says ""NOOO!"" in ""Return of the Jedi"", even MORE CGI aliens are plastered into Jabba's palace, Obi-Wan's new krayt dragon scream sounds like it's from a cartoon...it goes on and on.Just don't get these. The original films are NOT included on this, and you won't be buying the original Star Wars movies."
5,no surprises.,"Got exactly what I was expecting. Compact set of Stars Wars chapters I,II and III. Dust jacket not the greatest but movies are what mattered."
1,Noooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!,"Not gonna buy this.George, they are your movies and you can do whatever you want with them but please include the original versions. If you included them I'd buy no matter what you changed or put in. Heck, you could go nuts - put Ewoks and Jar Jar in every scene. Have a back seat in the X-Wing so Jar Jar can be with Luke when he blows up the Death Star. Ewoks on Hoth. Go to town. I'd still buy it with the originals included.Guess I'll pick up a bootleg version."
1,"release the proper versions, lucas, you dolt","everyone knows the tampered versions are horsecack. just put the originals out on dvd for those of us who don't want their star wars movies turned into the muppet show. greedo squeezing off a shot before han? what, is han stupid or something? george lucas, you really loused this one up for the fans."
5,Star Wars Triolgy,I was quite happy with the purchase of this item. It was a gift for a family member. The conditions was excellent - I would buy from this source again.
1,Befuddling,"I don't understand. All of these movies are supposed to take place after Episodes I and II, but for some reason, the technology disimproved. I'm so confused that I just wanna pee my pants."
2,I am embarassed...,"...to give the famous Star Wars movie anything less than 4 stars, especially after reading all the rave reviews the film has garnered. Well I saw the film and you know, I thought that it just wasn't THAT GOOD. It's not a bad film by any means, surely one of the best of it's kind, but I was unsatisfied after viewing it. I was expecting some super-science fiction extravaganza with the best special effects you've ever seen. I was sorely disappointed. The special effects are good, for the 70's. Today, they are hopelessly outdated and even distracting. I can see why somebody could become fanatical about this film, there are billions of characters to ponder over and there are little ""hidden things"" in the film to look for, but I have no desire or interest in ever seeing Star Wars again. That's just the way I feel, sorry if I offended anybody."
2,re-wrapped,looked like the DVD was re-wrapped with cheap plastic. Felt bad giving as a gift as it looks like it had been used.
4,"Why people need to calm down, and enjoy!","I may be from a diffrent genreation, and i may not have been there in the theaters from the beginning, but i do understand its impact and greatness. These three movies took sci-fi/fantasy to a new and real level. Now movies of that genre arent laughed at, they are worshiped. The special edition sucks, but i would rather watch Star Wars on DVD, with the surround sound, and enjoy, than have to stare that those crappy tapes i wore out. These movies tainted are still better than the new trilogy, so lets be thankful we now have them on DVD, and maybe we can look for the original edition someday. so just give in, and enjoy, or you can be upset.We all love them, and now we can enjoy them. thanks for reading, and try to listen to me"
1,Shame,"It's a real shame that George Lucas doesn't care enough about his fans to at least offer a release of the un-modified originals. Part of the fun of those movies was that they DIDN'T look perfect and that they DIDN'T have a CGI Jabba the Hutt. I can't believe some of the things I've heard that Lucas changed in these movies. I understand that George Lucas has the right to do what he wants to his films as they are his creation. But I also have the right to make sure that he never sees another cent of my money as long as he's being so selfish. Anyway...I heard that some REALLY BAD people *wink* somewhere on the evil Internet made DVD's out of recordings from the laserdisc releases of the films. I also heard from a ""friend"" that the quality is actually pretty good.One other funny thing I'd like to point out is that a lot of people's favorite Star Wars film seems to be The Empire Strikes Back. Go to www.imdb.com and check who directed it. It wasn't George Lucas."
1,The Day After The Apocalypse,"1 STAR, do you really need an explanation? This is just awful. I can't believe he got rid of the EWOK song. What a loser. George Lucas is like the Devil's younger, more sinister, uglier, bratty, stuck-up little brother. This crazy old dude needs a babysitter. When are we getting the originals and not these lame @#% clones?"
3,Should Have Released the Originals!,"When I saw the Empire Strikes Back Special Edition, I wasn't overly impressed with the new effects. The computer generated effects paled in comparison to the original magic. I never did see the other two installments because of that.I was thrilled beyond belief when I heard that the trilogy was coming to DVD, but when I read that it was the Special Edition version, I was totally appalled! I grew up with the originals and that's what I want to see on my TV. I think George should consider releasing the movies in their original glory for the old-timers and have the Special Editions on hand for those who don't know any better."
1,Nooooooooo!,"Where to start...? There is nothing ORIGINAL left. Lucas has done unspeakable things to this trilogy and franchise. Not even mentioning the prequels, don't even get me started on those effects-substituted-for-story movies. Jar jar...must ..contain ..nerd ..rage! How many more times will he re-release the real Star Wars with more trash added? Maybe Disney will have the intestinal fortitude a set to release the remastered ORIGINAL theatrical release, but I doubt it.Time for me to dig out my original VHS copies and back them up on my computer, it sure doesn't look like I'm ever going to be able to replace them.DO NOT BUY! NOT ORIGINAL!"
1,No. Noooooo,"People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.-- George Lucas's 1988 speech to the U.S. Congress"
2,I have a bad feeling about this,"I'm sorry, but I just can't take seeing Han walk over Jabba's tail one more time. The additional footage and CGI completely ruin the experience for me. What was once the best movie ever made has become a sort of annoyance and disappointment. It was hard for me at first, but I'm just starting to accept that I have fallen out of love."
1,"Just say no to the Special Ed, Edition.",A review to bring attention to the fact that it appears Lucas does not care about what the fans want.
3,Long awaited disappointment,"First, I loved the movies. How can you not love Star Wars? I enjoyed the updates Lucas put into the films. I will even say that at the end of Return of the Jedi, RETURNING Anakin is a good move. But my really big disappointment was the ""special"" extra 4th disk. I didn't mind too much that so much of the disk was just a commercial for Star Wars III ... you have to expect that. I was very upset that the major documentary turned out to be something I had previously seen on A & E. As someone who had laid out money for something that was suppose to be new and a bonus, I felt completely ripped off. I wish they had just been honest and sold me the 3 movies without the very non-special bonus."
1,over-edited,"George Lucas was once brillent. Now, it seems that all he cares about is money. He has over-edited and changed his classic trilogy so much that its integrity has been damaged. Fixing a blooper here and there is fine, but completly changing scenes and actors 30 years after the fact is just cruel. I love Star Wars and grew up on it, but let's have the original released on dvd and not this hack job."
1,Special Edition is not good.,"Once I heard that the DVD release was Special Edition, I went to ebay and found copies of LaserDisc to DVD transfer of the original trilogy. If you are looking for originals, thats where you can get the best copy of it."
2,Everyone take a breath,"The old original movies are coming out Sept 12th 2006 with no modifications, so now everyone can be happy."
4,Classic Star Wars,These are the Star Wars films we cheered and hissed at the theaters when we were younger. Sometimes having the original is the best gift of all.
1,Edited to nothingness,"The original three Star Wars movies are easily some of the best movies ever made. George Lucas has changed that with his incessant, pointless editing. Instead of Han starting out as a cut-throat, which he was, Lucas tries to paint a prettier picture by having him shoot second. Then the ridiculous scene with the CGI Jabba, which stands out worse than anything, continues the downhill slide. The original trilogy is now full of edited scenes, CGI bits that look awful, and changes that make no sense. George Lucas should know that while people love Star Wars, they love the original Star Wars. There's a reason that he made the prequels, because the originals (which you can only buy on DVD in one release (2008) which is twice the price of the whole 6 Blu-Ray movies) were awesome.Just like Darth Vader now says ""NOOOO"" to the Emperor, everyone needs to say no to George Lucas and not buy this ""Star Wars"" release."
1,What the fudge??,"I'm not giving this one star to be malicious. I'm doing it to show I support the original work. I miss Lapti Nek, the original Sarlacc, Vader's silent sacrifice at the end of ROTJ, all of it."
1,Theatrical versions please.,"NO dice for me until we get the original theatrical versions. I don't mind souped up sound, but keep the content the way it was...we all hate the 'improvments' made. The Jabba's palace musical scenes are totally unwatchable...The new Wampa scenes, cutesy robot antics, etc can all go too. What were you thinking Lucas?Give us the original and I'll bite. Until then, no dice."
1,The real Original,I'm just adding my support to get the actual Original Trilogy on blu-ray. I will not be buying the blu-ray until I can see an unaltered Trilogy on Blu-Ray.
1,Not buying unless the original versions are included,"Not giving George Lucas another dime unless I can get the original, theatrical versions of these movies. I don't want digital enhancements. I don't want changes after the fact. I don't want some kid born in 1984 digitally replacing Anakin's ghost at the end of Jedi. I want Han shooting first. I want the cheesy muppets and music in Jabba's palace."
5,Nice special effects,"When I was younger, I loved this movie. The special effects were good for 1977. The movie won 6 oscars, and lost Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Origional Screenplay to Annie Hall. Nice to watch."
2,missing disc,"upon receiving the trilogy, the empire strikes back disc was missing from the case. also the region of the discs i did receive are region 2. next time when you are reselling a box set of this sort, check to make sure all the discs are in their cases and display which region the discs are in your for sale post."
4,Changes?,"I am happy to finally see this on DVD, even the changes I can tolerate, it's still a classic to me.....But why did lucas put Hayden Christensen's ghostly image there, in Return Of The Jedi, instead of Sebastian Shaw? I mean if he is going to do that why not put Ewan McGregor's there instead of Alec Guiness? If your going to do it, do it right. I think its to soon to get excited about the next revision, ehh?"
5,If you want to know it all !,"I'm a big Star Wars fan, so I've been looking foreward to the DVD release.The main reason I bought it (besides now being able to see it on a big screen) were the bonuses. The documentary ""Empire of Dreams"" for examples, which was really great and tells the whole Star Wars behind the scene's story, from how it all started in George Lucas's mind and how it finaly came in the theaters.In the off chance that you're buying the DVD set and haven't seen the movies yet, see them first, and watch the specials afterwards, it'll be more magical if you don't know how they did it !Bottom line: I loved it !!!"
4,"Fantastic DVD Set, Comes up short on Special Features","The Star Wars Trilogy DVD set is a fairly cheap, very effective compilation of the Original Trilogy films. If you're looking to simply own the films so that you can watch them (both Remastered and Theatrical Versions) at will, then this is a great set to buy. However, the set lacks any really good special features or bonuses, other than some interesting commentaries on all the films and a Lego Star Wars II demo. It all really depends on what you want to own."
5,Classic Trilogy!,"Great movies with lots of features. Obviously those who already own the trilogy don't need to buy it again. But those who don't own it, it is a great buy! Can't wait for Blu-ray versions, but im not holding my breath."
5,An Ever Lasting memory,These are my favourt films since I was a kid. I'll all ways enjoy Star Wars no matter what.
5,I love the DVD Version...... BUT!!!,During the Audio Commentary i would of loved to hear More From George Lucas on how he came up with story concepts. I was so Very Very Tired of Hearing how Bert Burtt came up with sounds.... It got to the point where i was saying to the TV... Bert who gives a tinkers damn!!!!!!!
1,Bad Product,"I was disappointed when it arrived with the box crushed due to poor packaging-it was just wrapped in paper. However, poor packaging was not responsible for the wear spots on an item discribed as ""like new"". My real disappointment came when the DVDs didn't even work. Not much of a Xmas gift for my niece. I am VERY disappointed in the whole transaction"
1,the ol' double dip trick,"Sorry Lucas, I ain't playing your game. I'll wait for a remastered Blu ray edition... which probably will be re-released every two years itself."
2,NOT the Original!,"I do not know what Lucas means by original.. We all know he is the creator but he has clearly lost his touch on the essence of Star Wars over the years. I am impressed with the image and sound improvements BUT all of the additional scenes are idiotic with childish humor. If Lucas wants to make more money he should just remake the actual originals with the improved image and sound, that's actually what the ORIGINAL fan wants. Personally I believe that at some point a true artist has to know when to stand back and admire his creation.. unfortunately Lucas isn't there yet."
1,Wish I could do less than 1 star....,"I am another wishing for a HD version of the original prints - George said he doesn't have them any longer, and I am inclined at this point to not believe him... Yes, these are his movies, and yes, he can do as he wishes with them (which he has, again and again and again...), but to ignore the *original* originals, to say there is ""not enough interest"" is both short-sighted and arrogant. This isn't an issue of messing with someone's childhood memories - Star Wars was a game-changer for the industry, and for people who still love it enough 30+ years later to cry foul, people who have well-lined Lucas' pockets with their so-called lack of interest. The last Star Wars copies I bought were the ""definitve"" Laserdisc collection (15?) years ago, and that's not likely to change anytime soon."
1,star wars blu ray the complete saga,"Shame on the marketing of these films, claiming to have laboured over the inadequacies of the dvd releases. Lightsabers change colour every other shot and Vader has a mostly pink saber in ESB. Come on Lucasfilm. Put in the effort and make consistent changes rather than arbitrary changes here and there. Word of mouth is so important and for the last fourteen years you have consistently alienated true fans with cheap effects and ill judged changes. Look at Adywan's Revisited edit and see what could be. ILM must be holding their heads in shame if they have anyone left with talent who hasn't jumped ship to WETA."
1,Originals or nothing,"George,I have had it with you. I am not giving you another single cent until you restore the movies to their original glory. Face it. You messed them up. Your behavior is way past the point of anti-fan. And Episodes I-III were sub-mental.I have got my laserdiscs until you are ready. I will buy the blu-rays when you are ready. All of us will. Until then, don't bother."
1,Defaced Edition,"The Defaced Editions of the Original Trilogy are an insult to every artist whose work was destroyed and lost to the world by Lucas' actions. Not going to touch this with a thousand foot lightsaber. To give the fans the respect they deserve for making this franchise as big as it is, and to do right by all the people that worked hard made these films great against all odds, Lucas should do the right thing and sell (for massive profit!) a proper bluray transfer of the REAL films, and I don't mean as a half-assed special feature on the 2nd disk either."
1,Original,"Just give us a FULLY RESTORED version of the original trilogy along with the special editions, so people have the choice of the version they prefer."
3,Where is the DVD version???,"I don't understand the grudge Lucas has against the DVD format.Or perhaps he wants to demonstrate his influence over the mediaworld by steering revenue to his own interests. He may neveragree to have the original trilogy released on DVD because thatwould be a huge bruise to his ego: his desire to have his ownaudio 'standard' THX in the DVDs did not materialize, when firsttalks of putting the trilogy on DVDs took place.Oh give it a rest.. one can't have everything his way. I am nota fan of the man..only his work."
5,"STAR WARS Ep. IV is the best ,but where's the DVD?","I love Star Wars ,but I know I am not alone on that comment that It's about time George Lucas give the fans what we want! Is the special edition DVD to the Star Wars trilogy. 6 discs loaded with stuff that would take an entire day to see!!!! that would be Star Wars Heaven. I'm sorry ,but Episode 1 is just isn't enough."
1,Another vote for the original theatrical releases,"I don't really have anything more to say than most of the other reviews here. I love these movies...when they were first released. It's like plastic surgery: you can fine tune some things, but with enough ""tinkering"" you can completely ruin the original. And then to fix what you've screwed up, you desperately start tinkering some more. It's a downward spiral, and George Lucas has fallen right into it."
3,Where is the real Star Wars?,"While the digital process seems to have worked well as far as picturequality, you should be aware that these three films are not the originalversions; they are the versions that George Lucas has ""revised"" to bringthem ""into line"" with Episodes 1, 2, and 3. For instance, in Episode 4,a scene has been added just after the Cantina scene where Hans Solohas a conversation with Jabba the Hut and some bounty hunters. If youhave copies of the original versions of Episodes 4, 5, & 6; you willprobably not want to spend money on the new versions."
1,The Original Releases are by far the BEST,"I have been a fan of Star Wars since 1980, and the oringals are the best. I was very excited for the special editions when they were released in the 90s, but let us face it, George Lucas has lost his touch. He relies to heavily on ILM, which has very low grade technology, especially when compared to Weta Digital (the special effects creators for Lord of the Rings). Lucasfilm has tanked just like Disney. It is very sad to see two great film production compannies go downhill so quickly."
3,George has done this before?,"I saw the original star wars in the theatres in 1977 @at the age of ten. It was not called A New Hope and I think I remember a scene in which Luke and his friend Biggs have a conversation on the planet Yavan just before the end battle sequence. I think that scene was removed before the re release and the vhs release because it would contradict that Vader was Luke's father. It has been 30+ years, but I wonder if anybody else remembers it. I know that Lucasfilms has released the vhs versions a few times with different trimmings. I do beleave as many have stated that this is a marketing ploy to sell sell sell and that the originals will ultimatly be released someday. For allot of us it wrong to change these movies that we grew up with. They are more then just movies to many of us they are a part of our childhood. I therefore hold on to A New Hope (sorry I couldn't refuse) that the untouched versions will be released some day."
1,CHEAP - CHEAP - CHEAP,"Cheap paper box.Cheap title menus.Limited extras.My old VHS tape is clearer than the DVD on Episode IV.Sound is ""muddy"" on the DVD.These should have been released seperately at Wal-Mart for $4.78 each. Another cheap 20+ year old movie(s) released on DVD.Why did Lucas wait? All about the money? You will not get what you pay for!!"
1,Not the original films. Screw You George Lucas!,"I loved Star Wars and would love to see it on my hi-def plasma in all its glory. It is not to be found on these disks. Screw George Lucas for changing a wonderful film and then burying the original. I will not buy this product or any other Star Wars offering unti the original film is made available. I do not mind if the original film stock is restored or the sound is tweeked for modern home theater but for god's sake, don't change the plot.Han shot first!Han shot first!Han shot first!"
1,Lame,"Here I was thinking that Lucas was going to release HD, UNMOLESTED version of the original trilogy. BUT NO! Just another lie to get you to continue funding the destruction of a great film franchise."
1,WTF?!?!,"It's January 12th. Are they seriously taking pre-orders on a product due to be released on SEPTEMBER 2011?!?!?!?And for the record, there is ONLY Original Theatrical Release. Anything else I won't spend a dime on."
1,George Lucas has no soul,"First he deliberately keeps quiet about the changes to last years set, now he's trying to outright trick us- these are the very same 2004 destroyed editions from last year, but with the original theatrical poster art. a lot more unknowing people will be dupped.Being a Christian, there are somethings about Lucas I can't say here."
5,Star Wars Trilogy,"Love having the original theatrical versions of the film. It is comforting to know that I can watch Han Shoot first in IV and Sebastian Shaw reappear with Kenobi & Yoda at the end of ROTJ. Everything else is fine that Lucas added to his special editions in my opinion, but the Greedo shooting and Hayden Christiansen reappearing were terrible. I would definitely recommend this purchase!"
1,Don't order these if you want the unaltered originals! These are the tainted versions!,"Don't order this Blu Ray, unless you don't mind the alterations that completely ruin the story. I want the restored originals in all their Blu Ray glory, not these destroyed, modern-day Lucas abominations. Lucas is trying hard to make the originals as stupid as the prequel trilogy.Also - If you notice, Amazon has mixed up the reviews from previously released versions into the reviews for this Blu Ray. A pretty sneaky and unethical decision to try and boost sales. The REAL count as of 9/7/2011 for the BLU RAY version is:1 star - 56 votes2 stars - 6 votes3 stars - 5 votes4 stars - 8 votes5 stars - 17 votesAverage: 2 stars"
1,The saga is ruined...,"George Lucas RUINED the saga with all of his ""enhancements."" The fans want the original theatrical editions!I can't even describe what horrible changes were made...from Lucas inserting a CGI musical number in Episode 6, to changed dialogue, replaced effects, etc. Lucas needs to stop destroying his movies and release the original theatrical editions."
1,A Travesty to film and his fans!,"I just watched all of the ""special"" editions of the STAR WARS triliogy. They suck. The additions to the films are distracting, stupid, lame, and offensive! Does the origional voice actor for Boba-Fet know his voice is gone? What about the origional actor for Anikan...he is gone and replaced with Hayden Christensin!! Lucas did not direct ""Return"" and ""Empire"" he owns them in purley legal terms. I know...I'll buy the Beatles songs and use them in commercials! People hated that. I'll buy MGM Classics and colorize them!! Ted Turner was a fool. One day (even if it is after Lucas is dead) the REAL triliogy will be released and these will be forgotten like the colorized Three Stooges Georgie himself hated so much. Oh and the DVD transfers are terrible!! colors too bright and the blacks are way too deep like the contrast and color being off on your TV. This dvd set gets No Stars if that was possible."
1,Was great when I was a little kid,"When I was a little kid I loved Twinkies, GI Joes, Leggos, and Star Wars figures. I'm glad that my adult life isn't so sorely lacking in meaning that I still cling to these children's movies. The one star is for my kid, who might like them if he sees them before his tenth birthday."
1,stop changing the films lucas,"The DVD changes were hard to live with but I was going to upgrade to the bluray to get clearer picture at home, but the latest round of changes for the bluray is just too much, (Vader yelling 'nooooo' as he throws the emperor, cgi ewok eyes, etc.) canceled my order."
1,No Surprises here.,Crap. GL is forcing us to buy the entire 6-movie saga in order to get the 9-disc set! You don't get the 3 discs of special features if you only buy the original trilogy....and I don't want those crappy prequels in my house!
2,The Star Wars video marketing has made me nauseous,"Yes, the Star Wars movies have a lot of magic, especially the 70's and 80's versions. But the marketing ploys that have come along with it have really killed the mood. It started with VHS, one movie per tape. Then came the fancy boxed set. Then shortly after came the theatrical CGI update. Then came the VHS CGI-update boxed set. Then came the various incarnations on DVD, sold separately as full screen or wide screen, then came the boxed set. Then came the prequels (ok... this part didn't market me to death). Now it's time to double dip with blu ray. First we have the boxed set... cool. Why was the original non-CGI release not included? One blu-ray disc can hold both versions. Look for it later on yet another incarnation of the franchise. I give the original trilogy 4 stars, and the prequels 2 stars. The marketing over the years has jaded me, so I can only give 2 stars for all things considered."
1,Another vote for the original,"Mr. Lucas, you've had your fans give you enough money over the years, yet you continue to deny us the originals we want. Here's a hint, quite toying with us. You clearly are aware of how much the fans want the originals, yet every year you keep shoving the ""improved"" version on us. I refuse to give my money up unless I know there will be the movies I want to see, not the ones you want us to see. Until I know that there is the unaltered versions, I will only cast my vote as 1 star."
4,"Great Films, few options.","Quite simply speaking, these are spectacular American feature films. I understand however, the valid argument from both sides regarding the 1997 digital [CGI] re-issues. In most cases, such intrusions on the original work of any film would be unwelcome. Imagine adding or subtracting an element from The Wizard of Oz, Citizen Kane or dare I say [""dare... dare""] Blazing Saddles? In most cases it would appear invasive if anything. Films are, as they were at time of creation, imperfect - and should be respected as such. At the same time, an 'improvement' (or degradation in some minds) can be rewarding. Whatever your opinion, the persons responsible for the release of this set should have made special considerations for the legions of Star Wars fans by including both 'versions' of these pictures."
1,"Great movie, bad DVD","In an era when we are getting great DVDs for many films with different versions available (think Abyss and the Alien 9 disk series) it is a shameful that perhaps the greatest Sci-Fi movie ever made is not available in its original version, only in the director's cut. Whether or not you like this version better, the lack of availability of the original is a crime to any film lover."
1,"Wish there was a ""zero stars"" rating","I grew up watching these films. I went to each of the three original releases at least 10 times each with my friends. I (or, more often...my parents) purchased just about every Star Wars toys around at the time. I helped to make George Lucas a millionaire MANY times over. I cannot believe that he would completely change & re-do the films that made him so completely rich...& made so many people happy. If he wants to release these new ""& improved"" versions along with the originals that would be one thing. But, to change the originals so that they almost don't even appear to be the same movies is a tragedy. I WILL NOT buy these DVDs & I refuse to watch the next film when it comes out. The last two have been pure crap anyway...there's no reason to think it will be any better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS. IT'S A SHAMEFUL AND DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,"There is no music in the Yavin battle on Episode IV plus many other audio and video errors. The color is awful: you can see the lightsabers of all posible colors, the explosions are in black and white or have strange blue or green spots. The desert of Tatoine looks red and green sometimes. The Hoth scene looks all blue, etc etcYou can find all these and many more errors in the imdb forums:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/board/threads/"
1,Original and Special Editions on DVD,"Jazzman, here's a novel idea...Why not put both the originals and the special editions on DVD? That way, the originals can also be in a ""format that will not deteriorate"" and will provide for ""better picture"" and ""better audio"" viewing. Everyone will be happy. Original and expanded (special edition) versions are now available for the Alien movies and I don't see why the same can't be done to the Star Wars trilogy. Would you pay for leather bound books of re-worded and re-characteriezed Shakespearean plays that are being passed off as collector editions? I hope not."
2,UGHH(...) WHY!!,"WHY MUST LUCAS FORCE THIS SPECIAL EDITION DOWN OUR FACE!I find it to be a terrible act that the UN should move against. Future generations will never know the great music at the end of Return of the jedi, or the glory of the revoultionary model cinematography employed by Industrial light and magic that changed the course of movie making forever. Instead they are to watch a tainted version that has scenes that should have never been seen and computer models that look out of place. Why oh why can't you sell the real version. Instead you make me keep a 15 year old VHS copy of which I no longer own a VCR player. The normal non special edition of these movies are amongst the greatest movies ever made, I will never buy the special edition, I urge you to do the same."
1,Can't believe Lucas didn't release the ORIGINAL trilogy,"Man, I LOVE Star Wars as much as anybody else and I was so looking forward to the original trilogy as it was first shown in theatres to be released on DVD. What a disappointment that Lucas decided to release the ""Special Edition"" versions instead with the added footage of Jabba walking around, etc. I guess I have to wait another few years until this version runs it course and runs up the total in the bank account and then Lucas will finally release the original versions on DVD or whatever the new format is by then. (...)"
2,We Deserve better,"Loved these movies growing up. The first two are amazing and the third one is good. I have been waiting for years for these to come out but my excitement had dwindled since finding out we would not get the original versions; the ones we saw in the theatres in the late 70's. Fine, Lucas wanted to update some thing. I dont have a problem with that but when you change key plot points and whole character arcs because the Director has changed his mind than who are the losers except the people that paid Lucas and supported these movies originally?Guido shooting first is one of the biggest travesties to this trilogy and that is first and formost why I wont buy it.How about both versions Lucas? That too much to ask?I'd rather pay more to get the originals on Laserdisc and convert them myselves."
1,Give us the original movies!,I refuse to buy these butchered versions of the best movies ever made. Lucas' not-so-subtle scheme to milk more money from unsuspecting Star Wars fans is sickening.View the original versions on VHS. Skip the special edition DVDs.
1,Prepare to be gouged,"I bet that eventually Lucas will get so greedy as to release a version with the movies as they should be. When this happens people will end up paying for yet another set. If you buy this be prepared for a messed up movie, and to end up paying for it again in a couple years."
5,NONE BETTER!,"OK, first off, the original trilogy needed to be brought to DVD, period! Next off, as far as the special effects in the special edition go, good try, maybe they were shotty at times, but it's infinitely better than watching The Lord of the Rings (any of them) on a Saturday night. As far as which movie is the best, I can't even say that. Without one you wouldn't have the other. After all this, I think it goes without saying, this trilogy is awesome, none better, end of story."
4,Great movie and good quality used item,Other than a few smudges on the discs you would never have known this was a used set. Great moves at a great value!
4,It's fine,"The Bluray it's fine, i mean StarWars is StarWars, and the movie quality are great but i just don't undestand why some changes in the movie, so it's fine!"
1,Lucas has ruined the Star Wars saga,"It's funny that George Lucas was recently asked about the decision by some movie companies to colorize some classic black and white movies and he said ""doing so would ruin the films."" Doesn't he realize that he is doing the same thing to the only decent films he's ever made?"
2,New effects are too obvious from original,How can you change what made these movies great to begin with? It's like me getting a nose job after 50 years of having the one I've got. People are going to notice. I have the originals on vhs and will keep them instead replacing them with overdone effects. Too bad so sad.
1,But what about...,"Well my question to everyone is: What about the COMPLETE triology? Christmas is coming up and all the movies have been released so instead of making a copy of the triology that was released last year, why not make the complete triology of all the movies? Sure it'd be expensive, but that's what i've been waiting for! Does anyone have any news on whether Lucas is thinking of doing this anytime soon? Or is he just going to try to make more money on releasing things that have already been done?"
4,Damn Reviewers,"Everybody's preaching about the REAL starwars and how it was ruined, but it's the same fuss that was made when it was retouched many years ago and those versions are still good. From what I saw, all that was changed was that one scene with Han and Greedo, which, I admit, used to be one of my favorite scenes, but it's nothing to hate these great movies over. These extremist reviewer types need to first, get a life, and second, get over it! I love the originals as much as the next guy--I grew up watching and loving these films, but now I say quit whining. My advice is to get these DVD's and appreciate them for there stories and don't get so worked up over one scene like the other nutter reviewers. Don't let them ruin your rightful cinematic experience because they can't get over a small change."
2,Thanks For Listening To The Memories George,"Just wanted to thank George for stomping on my childhood memories of these original films for something - new. Really must be wonderful living in Georgie-Land. What if artists just went back and repainted their masterpieces to enhance them because ""that isn't what I originally intended.""Really, where were you when you initially painted them? In a coma? COME ON:-("
3,Why change the original,"I was pleased to finally get the trilogy on DVD after watching it for years on VHS. While they have restored the colour and improved the sound, I was disappointed in the additional CG scenes they added which I felt didn't add anything to the film just added minutes. But I was even more frustrated when they completely changed one of the characters in the final scene of Return of the Jedi where Obi, Yoda and Annakin appear. Instead of the older actor who played Darth when his mask is removed they superimposed a young Annakin. It would have been nice if they had included untouched versions of these scenes as additional footage so at least we can see how it originally was."
5,Best movie ever!,"Finally that movies come to DVD.. Feel good to see the action and adventure again. Love to see all them back. It is big different with E1 and E2. Now finally we are been waiting for to see E3 what happened to their mother. Like when Luke asked Liea about mother. Can't wait to see E3 action. Anyway,why not to add original movie like two side of disc so that we can see what the different of original movies and special edition.. I know George Lucas want to change.. I watched that DVD movie is great and I cannot remember what is like be in original movie that how much it change with Digital pictures. I just hope that George should make two side of disc with original and special edition."
1,Want the original? Don't give it 5 stars and don't buy it.,"""This is a vote for the original theatrical release."" - if you are posting this, don't give it 5 stars. There are too many people saying that they vote for the originals but are going ahead and giving it 5 stars anyway.The only way Lucas will ever release the theatrical versions is if product reviews are terrible and he is making no money. That is the ONLY way. It's obvious by now that he will not listen to impassioned pleas from fans. Do everyone a favor: 1 star & DO NOT BUY."
1,Star Wars Trilogy 2004,"I had just about convinced myself that I could live with the ""Special Edition"" if that was my only choice...however, when I read about the additional changes made in the 2004 version, I cancelled my order...I do not understand 1.) why they have to change the dialog in a movie that many people have practically memorized, and 2.) why it is necessary to put Hayden Christensen's ""ghost"" in the final scene replacing Sebastian Shaw...(I have not been very impressed with Episodes I and II anyway.) Maybe an ""artist"" does have the right to change his own work, but I think it's a shame that so many fans are being robbed of these beloved classics. After all, it was the fans who made the original movies so successful, and we liked them just the way they were... :-("
5,ROTJ - Hayden Christensen Added ???,Why did they add Hayden Christensen to ending of Return of the Jedi? Vader did redeem himself before he died. It was appropriate to show him older in the original movie. They did not need to add Hayden Christensen. But since they did why not also add Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson.
1,No thank you Mr.Lucas,No thank you mr. Lucas. your changes are not what I want from this series. thank you for understanding that I'll never purchase another Lucas Arts Product.
5,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!,"Star Wars episodes 4, 5 and 6 are three of my favorite movies, well really Episode 4 a new hope is one of my favorites of all time, and the other two complete the set. The empire strikes back is very good but not a classic like a New Hope, it is action packed from beginning to end, and Return of the Jedi is a little too hoakey and to much for the 3-12 audience, with the ewoks and all. Nevertheless all three movies are fun and its great to get them on DVD (after all this time) in pristine condition. They look and sound great. There is also an extra disk of extra's, for those who like those things. I personally do not care about the extras, I do not have the time to waste on that kind of thing; But I know there are people out there who will judge the DVD's on the extras alone. Well, to each there own. This set is worth it to have a New Hope on DVD alone."
2,Star Wars,"The release for the fourth time (or more) is not necessary, I hope Lucasarts don't tell us it's a limited edition. The task of this release is the carrying of the Episode II-trailer. The films are really good, but we don't need another release. The remastering isn't done quite good, listen to the surroundsound of TESB, it is clear but not good encoded (my personal opinion).Lucasarts continues in their polticis of releasing products of minor quality (Episode 1 PC-Game, Many Stuff of the E-1 Merchandise). I think many fans will be able to pay higher prices for better quality.To come to an end, this trilogy is only for kids and people that entered the starwarsuniverse through Episode 1 for the first timeJovo (i'm not 12)"
5,A whole new mythic world as well as great movies,"Star Wars are not just great movies - though I still remember the thrill of seeing the first one 25 or so years ago (I am that old....). But they are a whole new, exciting mythic world, an alternative universe, but with the same battles between good and evil, tyranny and freedom, as our own. This new edition enables us to enjoy them even more than before - transport yourself to a distant galaxy a long time ago and enjoy!"
2,Should of been a lot better for what I paid,"I don't know what they were thinking when putting this set together. If you going to update it, you might as well fix the jumpy light saber scenes(new hope). For what I paid for this set I was expecting deleted scenes, original scenes, etc. Nope all you get is a magical audio comments. I would return this nurf turd if I could, but I can't. This blu-ray set is nothing more then a widescreen version of the DVDs."
4,"Iit's Good, but could be better...","Ok, I bought this hoping that the editions of the movies where in fact the special editions, with all the same features, and when I got it and watched it I found out that there was no Spanish subtitles, just audio. This was a little disappointing for me, I live in Venezuela and the people I watch movies with doesn't speak English... that's why I give this product 4 stars, doesn't have extras per se, we got the movies in the original edition and the special enhanced editions."
1,Will Not Buy,I won't buy this if it doesn't include a high def version of the original without any more film editing than cleanup of dust and matte lines. The new cgi enhanced versions are crap. I wish I could give Lucas' New & Improved version 0 stars.
4,Like finding a fly in your food at your favorite restaurant.,"I have loved the Star Wars TRILOGY since I was a grade school kid when the first film came out in 1977. I honestly didn't mind the changes made in 1997. Perhaps they were a bit more show-offish than adding any real meat and potatoes to the story, but they weren't a major distraction for me. What IS a real distraction is adding Hayden Christensen to the ending of Jedi. This so-called 'actor' gives the most wooden, amateurish performances I've seen in ages, so adding even the slightest reminder of this goofball to the 3 classic films is absolutely abhorrent to me. In my universe, the overly kidified advertisements for Star Wars playsets known as episode one and two don't exist so adding a reminder of them to the tasty portion of the movie series is a serious low blow from Darth Lucas. Don't throw away your old VHS copies of the films if you have like-minded sentiments about the films."
1,"""What a piece of junk!"" Not ANOTHER re-release, George!","Okay folks, if you buy this piece of tripe, you're only contributing to the overly-commercialized world of Star Wars. This edition is just a downright shame, and the quality is worse than the first Special Edition release. For one thing, George Lucas should be ashamed that this was allowed to be released again, and on VHS, no less. Whoopty-do, it has flashy packaging and a ""featurette"" that has NO interviews with the cast and dances around things about SW2 that we ALREADY KNOW. If you just happened to miss the SE the first time, go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise, just let it rot on the shelf. George, I certainly hope, for your sake, that when you FINALLY release the DVD's of this Trilogy, you include the ORIGINAL, GOOD versions of the films. Episode I is a JOKE, and hopefully George has learned from it. He's been outta the chair too long, and ruined his own baby, as did the licensees."
1,Pass...,"Greedo shooting first. Taking the magic out of the Force by giving it a pseudo-scientific explanation. Stormtroopers explained by cloning a super-bounty hunter (except, apparently, his ability to hit what he aims at). George Lucas has revised his masterwork to the point of incoherence. I'm sticking to the DVD release of the original trilogy - as flawed as Mr. Lucas might regard these films, they are far more fun than the 'technological terror' he has constructed. Hey, George! What are you trying to push on us?"
1,Blu-ray Announcement - No Original Trilogy,"I'm sure this will sell well, but I will not spend a dime on this because it does not include the original trilogy. I tried to watch Episode IV Special Edition last night. Every time it gets to the ""Look sir, droids"" scene with the cartoon stormtrooper on dewback in the background, I end up turning it off. I just can't watch it. Something just doesn't sit well with all the extraneous additions. I don't mind a little cleaning up and tinkering. For example, I kind of like what they did with cloud city in Episode V. There were just way too many changes for my taste though. It's just my opinion and I'm glad some people will get enjoyment out of this set...just not me.Update: I just knocked my rating down from 3 stars...nnnooooo to this set and the complete saga!"
3,"Great films, sleazy merchandising tactics","This is the Star Wars Special Editions on DVD. Unlike typical Director's Cuts, the Special Editions include many altered original scenes rather than merely additional footage. In other words, these are not the original A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi, although this is intentionally non-obvious from the packaging and marketing.The original three Star Wars films are great. This marketing campaign is not. It is worth noting that aside from a few rare laserdiscs, Lucas has intentionally refused to release the original films in any permanent form. His attempts to pass off this DVD set as the original is vile enough, but also merely assures in a few years that he will likely release an 'original' Star Wars DVD set for another round of gouging. Be advised."
5,"even with changes, still a classic...bonus features great","It's too bad that DVD technology is not such that we can simply choose to watch the films with or without the changes. In any case Lucas' changes don't spoil my viewing Star Wars. Granted I would have preferred the original, but I'll forgive the creator of Star Wars for his indulgence! That said, I'm thoroughly pleased with the picture and sound quality. I loved the bonus features, especially the feature on the production of Episode IV. It was great seeing the casting calls and watching some of the famous actors and actresses of the time trying out for the various parts."
2,"Wow, is Star Wars gonna change every few years now?","Well, lets just say that the changes might be for the better, but I think its more or less that Lucas has to fill the holes in the storyline that didnt work at all. I cant wait to the Ultra Extended Editions to come out of Lord of the Rings in the next 40 years"
4,"Star Wars Trilogy 4,5,6","It is a trilogy which I have seen previously & wish to add to my library. I now need to add 1,2,3"
3,Disc skipped,Bought the movies for my kids to watch and the first disc has skipped two times. It eventually worked through it so I'm not too mad - but what do you expect for $30!
2,Not high quality!,"While the video is better, the color restoration is inconsistent (some things change color, even in the middle of a scene). Worse, the audio is really bad, especially in some of the dialog scenes in A New Hope. The noise it so bad in some, it sounds like someone off-camera is using a power saw. Don't buy this one if you already have the VHS version. Wait until Lucas actually does a non-half-ass job of restoring these."
1,Not the original movies!,"After reading reviews claiming that the original, uncut, unaltered movies were included with this set I was anxious to get it so I could finally get rid of my old VHS original movies. I was very disappointed from the very start when C3PO's silver (not original) leg let me know that these are in fact, not the original movies. I know this has all been stated in other reviews, but it really is deceptive to lead people into thinking this product is something that it is not."
1,give these films to Criterion to release properly,"I am a HUGE Star Wars fan which is why i'm not buying these altered films where Greedo shoots first and Han steps on Jabba's tail and the Max Rebo band is jamming to ""Jedi Rocks"" ... etc.. why can't lucas just make his money off of all the suckers for a year and then give Criterion access to the film and put out the version of these films that real fans have loved and people who weren't able to see them in 35mm film, can at least check them out in Hi Definition quality.... in the past Steven Sansweet, speaking for Lucas, said that the original cuts of the films would never make it to dvd, a few years later they did arrive (although they made sure to put them out in poor quality, and non-anamorphic) so there is hope, ESPECIALLY IF ENOUGH PEOPLE SPEAK UP AND BOYCOTT THIS FILM."
2,Could have been perfect,"Could have satisfied everyone by including the original, untouched movie for the old timers, and the special edition for everyone else. The Alien Quadrilogy has both versions for each of those films.I think a lot of people (literally thousands) will be downloading pirated versions of these films just so they can get the original version. That's a lot of lost DVD sales. The set could have had both, but inexplicably didn't.I feel sorta disappointed. After all, these were my favorite all-time movies."
1,Not Gonna Do It,"I see now that I have to hold on to my THX laserdisc original versions a whole lot longer.I will absolutely, unequivocably, NOT buy this. It really irks me that George Lucas shows such flagrant disrespect not only to fans of the films, but to the films themselves. In the interest of brevity, let me put it simply: RELEASE THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS! William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin did it right with The Exorcist Blu-Ray: they treated the original 1973 version and the 2000 expanded edition as seperate entities, and gave each a lavish and respectful co-release in one, awesome package. That way, Mr Lucas, you present your updated version, while still honoring and respecting the hallowed place the original films hold in the hearts and imagination of a generation. Until then...NO SALE."
1,Theyre Just Mynocks Chew,"Star Wars, more like Star bores! These movies are the pits, theyre banthor fodder. If i had it my way id take all the copies of all the movies, and throw them into a cave with a Wampa. Luke...a hero, yah right! His metaclorian count is like not even half of what his fathers was! Not to mention Emporor palpitine what a jerk...he looks like my grandmother...real scary. Im gunna move to the dagoba system if i hear anymore about this film. Anyone who likes star wars is a dork. There mothers didnt love them, their fathers were alcholics, and there sisters did DEATH STICKS!... Once i put the movie on i turned it off in less than 12 parcects... see you on the kessel run!"
1,Hmmmm,"With all this money he is getting, when is George Lucas going to have that goiter removed from around his neck?The first film (or I guess number 4) is ok and the Empire Strikes Back is wonderful, but then the films all became kiddified & stupid. The prequels are absolutely dreadful & Ewoks must die!"
5,star wars trilogy,i think george lucas is not very nice. i wish we could buy star wars trilogy and go home happy. and so we can enjoy the movie eny time we wont.i wish he would gest relise the movies agin.
5,The Star Wars Trilogy!,"For those who remember, for those who never forget, and for a entire generation. StarWars, Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi Are the 3 times of adventures than changes movie makind forever. Own Now the Gorges Lucas Masterpiece. Because The Force is Forever, and for all generations.A long time ago in a galaxy, far, far away....STAR WARS"
5,The Best Movies Ever!!!!,"These are the best movies ever!!!! There will never be another movie/movies like it!!!! Return of the Jedi is my favorite, next is the Empire Strikes Back, then a New Hope, and last but not least, the Phantom Menace. The characters are awesome, and it hardly even seems like they're acting, it's so good! The story is perfect, the effects are fab, and it all seems so real. I'm a girl, yes, a girl, and I love these movies to death. Han and Leia make the perfect couple, and the movies would not have been as good without the love story. George Lucas, and everyone else who particapated in this movie,(including the awesome actors/actresses,I think Han is sooo cute!)you did a perfect job. May the force be with us fans. Always."
1,Crap. Can I get the originals on DVD?,"Looking at these new movies, it's obvious that it sure as heck wasn't just Lucas that made the originals so great. I would send these expensive coasters back if I could.Instead, I have bought a laserdisk player and the original theatrical versions on laserdisk, secondhand, and will burn them to DVDs to preserve forever.I have a feeling a small cottage industry is going to form around digital copies of the original movies. Shame that they may never be released on DVD, but I for one, will preserve the originals for future generations."
1,One word. Greedo.,"The word Greedo can sum up two major points of these dvds.1. He does NOT shoot first. Why would Lucas feel the need to change this? And Greedo must have had one too many Cantina drinks if he could miss from a distance of 1 foot...2. Greedo - o = greed.Lucas and his Special Editions, terrible new trilogy, edits, etc, are nothing but a chance to milk the franchise dry. Leave the classics alone! Isnt the Skywalker ranch big enough?"
1,not cool Lucas,"Not releasing the TRUE originals on blue ray is a slap to the face of die hard fans that waited so long.I do not care if the revised versions are out there, but give us the option to see the movies we grew up with too."
3,"Forget it, folks","Those of you hoping for a Blu-Ray release of the untouched original versions can save your strength. Lucas hates those versions and wants the world to forget they ever existed. We're lucky that he finally, after years of pleading from fans, released the non-anamorphic DVDs of the original versions. We won't be getting anything else.I'm sure he's fixed it so that they can't ever be released even after he's gone. I heard once that he destroyed the original negatives to make the SEs and that wouldn't surprise me.My advice would be to track down and buy the DVDs, laserdiscs, or even the old VHS tapes of the original versions and keep them in good shape."
5,This better be a 6 disc set when it's finally out on DVD!,"First of all, Lucas better release just a simple remastered edition of the ORIGINAL film, without Jabba added and the new touches he gave for the re-releases (Disc 1). A 2nd disc could have that version on it. A 3rd disc needs to have about 8 commentary tracks (at least). A 4th disc needs to have interviews with the entire cast. A 5th disc needs to cover Star Wars merchandise. A 6th disc needs to have the film with ALL the unused footage thrown back in, including the original opening sequence (according to the script) with Luke and his friends chatting on Tatooine, or at least ALL the deleted scenes. And Lastly, it better be out pretty damn soon, before I die or something!"
4,How about DVD availability,"I also am looking for the entire Star Wars set on DVD. I currently have Episodes I and II, but I am anxiously awaiting for the day when the Trilogy is available on DVD. I hope that it is available at leat by next Christmas."
5,GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!,"Where the heck is the dvd!! This is the greatest movie ever, and yet they still don't have it on dvd. There will never be a movie this great forever. The newer ones are pretty good, but until ep. 3 we won't be able to appreciate all the films as a whole. 2005 I'm there!!"
4,Oops! George Lucas sold out again!,"I promise I won't bore any of you with how great star wars is, because you probably already know too! All I will say about the movies themselves is that they are 3 of the best films of all time, original and clever. My beef with the new release is how George Lucas is selling another version of the same films over and over again. The Special Edition series was great, and like many fans, enjoyed it a lot. But form what I heard is that this new release is the special edition with a featurette on Ep. II. This a pretty cool, but you can get all of that of the starwars web site for free. They even have great streaming videos. Obviously, if you have a degraded old version or don't own this series at all, please buy this! But if you are like me, and already own the Special Edition, please check out the website for a lot of cool stuff on the film without having to pay 35 bucks to see new ep. 2 scenes."
5,This is the Holy Trilogy,"Yes, I know changes were made, but I still think this is the Holy Trilogy... Star Wars, Empire and Jedi. Why do I think this is the Holy trilogy ? Because I grew up watching these films. Star Wars started it all; merchandising, soundtracks, comic books, etc... then Empire came aboard to kick all of out butts (Luke, I AM your father), and even though Jedi was somewhat corny, it still was great !!!"
1,We want the originals George Pukeus,"Quit ruining something millions of people thought was just fine, at least give us the frikkin option of watching it the classic way, clean the old ones up and put them out."
4,Great set,The set just arrived I eagerly opened it as its been sometime since Ive seen these movies and that was back in VHS form. The qaulity of the individual disks and cases seems great. I ordered Used but like new condition and it was as expected. I cant wait to pop these in and watch them on my big TV what could be better? Anyways my only complaint is the outside box that holds the movies is a little bit bent not bad though but like I said I ordered used but oh well. The disks seem very clean and the original papers and materials are in the cases so its basically new.
5,And this is why George Lucas needs to hurry up and die.,"I didn't buy the BluRays, I won't buy the 3-D BluRays that will be released after they've all played in theaters, and this DVD collection is another reason why I won't be buying another copy of a Star Wars movie until after George Lucas dies. Why pay $300 to watch it almost exactly as I could from the old VHS?When Lucas finally kicks it, someone smart at Lucas Arts will finally compile all of the different film versions (including the for-real originals, but formatted for modern TVs) and release them as a 27-disc BluRay set. I'll pay $300 to have my childhood back then, thank you."
1,"Disappointed, no sale!","I can't tell you how glad I am to still have the dvd release of the unaltered original films. While they are sub-standard in this digital age of restoration, they aren't further down the road of bastardized revisionism. Yes, Lucas can do as he pleases, too bad he doesn't realize all that earned wealth comes at the price of whatever cinematic soul he ever had. Those of us who love film, who love truth told at 24 frames per second (or 30 in the video age), must rise up against this empire. Just say NOOOOOOO to the dark side."
1,"George, come back from the dark side!",George you love $$$ so give us what we want! Stop screwing this once great franchise and give the fans what they want. The unedited original theatrical versions!!!
2,Item in gross condition,"Although the item came very quickly (within a few days), it is not in the shape the seller described. The box is sticky & there's even food all over it! I didn't contact the seller because I think can clean some of it (the box will probably be even more damaged though) & it's just a movie, but it certainly is not what I paid for."
1,"Thumbs down George, give us the real deal.","I have the Original Trilogy on laser disc and will stick with it until George gives us a remastered version, to the best of his ability. Nothing less will do. George was blessed with a creative muse that helped him create a masterpiece, and he would honor it by re-releasing it in modern quality.In the meantime, I will enjoy my laser disc version, which brings me the closest to experiencing the movies as I originally saw them."
1,A travesty!,"Plain and simple: this box set should have included BOTH the classic AND the new and ""improved"" version of each film.Lucas has every right to tinker with and add to his films - BUT he also should have had the decency to respect the historical legacy of the Star Wars films, not to mention the desires of Star Wars fans. Anyone with the slightest bit of forsight or common sense would have recognized that to release these films adulterated with new material would be hurtful to a large number of fans. And any director/producer with the slightest bit of integrity would have respected the artistic value of the original versions.A simple compromise should have been made: release both versions on the DVD set.Personally, I will hang on to my laserdiscs (which contain the original versions) and buy the ""new and improved"" DVDs if (and only if) I find a used copy on the discount rack."
5,Awesome classic,The Star Wars Trilogy on DVD is excellent. We are so glad we purchased the set. My husband and I watched the movies with our kids over a period of 2 weeks. Was so great to experience it through their eyes seeing it for the first time. The DVDs were in perfect shape. Would buy from this seller again.
4,"Wouldve been 5 stars, but...","The fondest memories of my childhood are all rooted in the Star Wars Trilogy - the original versions. I give the original versions of the films 5 stars, as well as the special features on the new DVD. The recut versions, however, are disappointing."
5,Very Good Transfer,"While I'm not terribly happy with the changing of some events in the movies (most of them are minor and don't affect the overall story), I would have to say this is one of the best DVD sets so far. This is the set that I bought a DVD player for in the first place. Now that I get to hear it in 5.1 and see the picture in amazing clarity, I am a happy camper.As for the changes, now Greedo and Han shoot at the same time, which isn't too bad. There is different dialogue with the Emperor in Empire, but that seems to be more consistent with the current Star Wars movies. Not sure why Lucas added Haydyn Christensen unless it was for consistency sake again. Although, if there is some other reason, it's pretty silly because Obiwan is old and he didn't change him.Overall though, this was an awesome job."
4,"Longtime Star Wars fan, slightly disappointed","This set would get five stars from me once upon a time. However while I will probably buy it I can't help but be disappointed by the supposed changes to these classics that make them less classic. Mr. Lucas is trying too hard to make these movies fit in with the very inferior prequels when it should be the other way around. People who welcome these changes are part of the generation of fans who prefer movies that use a ""story"" to show off special effects rather than use effects to help tell the story. Yes, I know the meat of the story in this trilogy is very much in one piece. However, who would want to see Gone With the Wind or The Wizard of Oz be ""updated""? So why should these movies be touched? These still are great movies. I just really wish I could see them on DVD the way I first saw them about twenty years ago."
1,"RELEASE ORIGINAL CUT, ELIMINATE CGI","I was born in 1983, so I never saw star wars in the theater in the original cut.. but my dad was smart enough to buy me the VHS box set before the films were destroyed with excessive CGI. It is a real shame, I will not buy any star wars movie unless its the original cut."
2,Only reason to buy is the original unaltered versions.. which are poor quality.,"I bought this a while back, when it came in the nice metal case. I was extremely disappointed. I only bought this version because it contained the original, unaltered movies as well as the newly bastardized versions. Well, the unaltered versions aren't remastered at all, they're straight transfers of the Laserdiscs. Which is extremely low quality. If you have a 16x9 TV you'll have to use the zoom feature to fill the screen, just like with a laserdisc, and the subtitles for Greedo and the other characters are BELOW the 16x9 viewing area, in the black bar that would normally be on the bottom of the screen when watching on a 4x3 standard tv set.This is not what I paid $60 for."
5,Revisiting 3 of My Favorite Movies,"I was really pleased with the Star Wars Triology as I have always been afan of the Star Wars Films. This set has several enhancements add sincebeing re-released that filled in several gaps from the original versions.I would highly recommend this product to Star Wars fans and to ScienceFiction fans who have never seen them. Order them, view them, and enjoyand I an sure that you will be as satisfied with them as I have been."
5,The Star Wars Trilogy has never looked better!,"This version of the Star Wars Trilogy is simply the best these films have ever looked. The colors are brighter and the detail is sharper than any other version. Some fans my balk at the changes to the films, they are minor and are mostly to make all of the films fit together as a unified saga.The bonus features on the fourth disc are also top notch. Empire of Dreams is a fascinating look at the making of this series and reveals stuff that even this hardcore fan has never, ever seen before.If you are a Star Wars fan, then buying this set is a no brainer. If you simply love good films then you will want to have the authoritative collection of these films on DVD to admire for years to come."
1,Let the market decide,"I can't tell if this is a sucker ploy or not. Will they finally release the editions that I and many others want after sales of the ""special"" edition begin to slump? That shows how bad things are getting. They will do anything to get you to buy the same thing three and four times over.I'm holding out for the original editions. If they never come, oh well more money for better things.P.S. Don't be at all surprised if next year they come out with a 6 DVD box set that will end up being the only way to buy ""episode 6"" (or the original versions)."
2,Scratched Disc and Han Solo shoots first!,I bough this disc set as used and of course one of the discs were scratched. Luckily PC DVD drive was able to read it even if living room Bose refused to work.And Han Solo shoots first. And ghost of Hayden is less patriarchal than original.
5,Good price,I ordered this set of DVD's along with the prequel from amazon and was able to save about 50% by buying them separately. Great deal and fast service.
1,RECONSIDERING MY PURCHASE,"After reading these reviews I will wait until the old version is on DVD I do not want to own this NEW version, thanks for your reviews I'll wait, patiently until Mr. Lucas decides now is the time, until then I'll stick around & save my money."
5,Great Compilation,Three great classic movies ment to be watched one after the other. Excelent fiction story.
3,TO: George Lucas RE: Star Wars on Blu Ray,"George,I get why you don't want to release the originals on Blu Ray. You've fixed the loose gaps and in your mind, they are now perfect. OK.Now you're fans are all turning against you. Here's a way to turn it around, get them back and not mess up what you've fixed:Add the originals as bonus material & call them ""Original Unfinished Versions"" so future fans won't confuse what you consider the originals to be.Think about it. You can even say you thought of the idea. I don't care.Looking forward to seeing the originals on Blu Ray,Tom DibStar Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) [Blu-ray]"
1,The originals and ONLY the originals,"I pledge not to buy any revisionist crap from Lucas, unless and until he offers the original theatrical versions of the first two and a half films (I don't care what he does with the effing dancing bears, as long as I don't have to watch it)."
3,Not what I expected,"My only complaint is that there is a lot of grain in these blu-rays, particularly in the outdoor scenes. A little grain is fine but this just seemed to be too much. It's very distracting. The newer trilogy blu-rays don't seem to have this same problem. I know these are old movies but surely that could be cleaned up a little. Indoor scenes looked great!"
1,I am so dissapointed,"I just found out these are the ""improved"" versions of the trilogy. I was so excited to buy these and now I will not. I too belive George Lucas is wither extremely selfish or extremely smart. I think it may be the ladder. I think he will get everyone to buy this junk then later on release the REAL versions of these movies so everyone will have to buy them again."
2,"Average -- considering Eps. 4,5,6 were made in the yr 2004","Episodes 3, 4 and 5 should be considered 2004 movies NOT movies from the 70's and early 80's. So for movies that have taken 25 years to make (begun in 1976 and finished in 2004 - unless George Lucas is still ""not happy"" with the current results) these movies are quite average by 2004 standards.I suppose as computing power gets more powerful in the coming years George Lucas will replace the whole thing with flawless digital characters. George Lucas has joined the Dark Side...more machine now than man.By the way,...when the Death Star blows up at the end of episode IV, all I can think of is the Klingon moon, Praxis, blowing up at the opening of Star Trek VI. Apparently George Lucas had that effect in mind as well in 1977,"
