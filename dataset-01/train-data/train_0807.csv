4,Lose yourself,"I hadn't read a Ludlum novel since high school in the mid-eighties. Spy books have lost their teeth over the years but I've been in a spy-ish mood lately (go figure) and I decided to pick this one up (after burning through Andy McNab's earlier books which are great). Even though ""Prometheus"" has plot holes and inconsistencies galore, it's a tremendously fun read. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered (mainly in regards to bit-part characters and logic) but somehow it kept me intrigued and hungry for more. So go lose yourself if you're an old fan of Ludlum and looking for a late night book to absorb you."
2,Can't Do it Every Time,"A good author is not always successful in delivering a good book. We, as readers, need to be more circumspect about assuming a good author always provides us with a good read.that is why reding reviews is. I presume, a good thing to do before buying a book. This book is predicated upon a ridiculous premise and is filled with events that just don't sell. You want to read Ludlum, but you don't want to read this Ludlum. It is just not realistic and although many such fiction novels are unrealistic this one is so far off the mark so as to come across as a cartoon. Skip it."
2,Not Vintage Ludlum,"I've read every Ludlum book multiple times. His mastery of the past of twisting plots and extremely interwoven details has gone by the wayside with Prometheus. Way too many ""just happened to have"" answers and overly simplified answers that lead to plain unbelievable consequences. I have considered Ludlum to be the absolute best at keeping details and plots with ""no holes"" and this book does nothing to compare to his previous works.Ludlum has gone from writing his unique style books, to writing cheap James Bond type thriller types meant to please the mass public accustomed to TV paced adventures.The true Ludlum fans can only hope he comes back to his own unique writing form in the future."
1,"Mr. Ludlum,","Okay, you had me hooked. And fooled. Batman is back, and Robin too. Think I'll go back and re-read Bourne Identity."
3,Too Much Action,"While better than Mr. Ludlums most recent efforts, which have been quite weak, the excess of action is a little bit hard to swallow. No human being could could possibly survive half of what Bryson was was faced with in this book. The first half of the book showed great promise, but about midway through it digressed into cheap action film material."
2,Forced plot twists very annoying.,"I love a compelling story that features believable plot twists. This book is neither believable, nor entertaining to read. There are major plot twists so often, that the reader loses track of the good guys and the bad guys. This book features a 50+ page escape scene with so many 'missed chances' to kill the defenseless hero, in a dark, closed room, that I nearly put the book down at that point. Thankfully, I read on to experience the worst shooting assassins the world has ever seen. This book is far too unbelievable, and there are far too many plot twists to keep the reader interested. Thumbs Down!"
1,Zero credibility,"I purchased this book based on a reviewer's comments that it was a return to Ludlum's earlier days of high quality, fast paced novels. Wrong. The book is very poorly written with contradictions in statements, logic and common sense occurring within paragraphs and in a never-ending stream throughout at least the first 125 pages of the novel. At that point I could no longer tolerate the lack of writing or editorial quality and quit reading. Save your time and money."
2,Too much going on,"Reading Ludlum's stories of deception, turns, treason and other misconceptions is usually a lot of page turning fun. I have read quite a few of his books in one or two ""sittings"". But what he puts Bryson through in this book is just toooooo much.Any other character would have to make it through 5 books to meet and beat all the bad guys, high tech aggressors and traps and I wonder, where Bryson carries all his equipment and weaponry that lets him get through all those challenges unharmed.If this book were a hot dog.....there is too much relish, ketchup, mustard, onions, pickles and not enough dog!"
2,Disappointed,"I've read most of Ludlum's so this one was a bit disappointing. Too formulaic and downright lazy in parts. The dialogue was sloppy. One too many ""oh my gods"" made me think the characters were more wowed than I was.Aquitane Progression and the Bourne trilogy rules."
2,What is going on here?,"""The Prometheus Deception"" is part Jason Bourne,.... Just like in the Bourne series, the protagonist never knows who is on his side or who he can trust, which, of course means everyone betrays him.This by itself wouldn't make it a bad book, but the plot twists don't make any sense. The ending is horrible, and if you think back to the beginning of the book, you would realize that the only way that things would happen as they did, is if the bad guys are intentionally trying to screw themselves.I would not recommend this book..."
3,"Getting better, finally","I have been a Ludlum fan for many years but his past three or four books have not been up to his earlier ones. This one's better but still not up to snuff. Hope the next one is better yet. Oh yeah, I'll continue to buy them. He's still very good."
1,"Outrageous adventurous plot, but poorly delivered","Robert Ludlum's novels have always appealed to me because of the sense of adventure and the fast-moving plots.This book was disappointing. It gave me the impression that the plot was fleshed out by somebody just shoveling things into it. Something that starts out as a container ship later is referred to as a ""tanker"". Our hero ""sagged to his feet"", whatever that means.This half-written, half-read book goes into the ""donations"" box."
2,Typical for the genre.,"Straightforward conspiracy/spy potboiler. I'm supposed to say something about the plot, but really, that's all this book has going for it. I wouldn't want to spoil it for you guys who enjoy dumbing down during a flight. Ludlum has had at least two of his works produced as action/thriller movies. I'm sure that is what he had in mind. Just cut out most of the cheezy dialogue and tiresome weapons cataloguing - presto you have a script. I enjoy a good Schwartzenager or Segal movie from time to time. No matter how silly. But, why would you want to READ such a thing?Ps. A writer like Ludlum sure could a capable editor here. Some of the errors are very glaring."
2,Ending [stinks],"This is a good book, right up until the end... If you gloss over some minor cliches and errors, the flow and suspense is great. But this sets up for an anti-climatic ending. Where did Abu come from (a villian from the first chapter, but never again mentioned until the last hand to hand combat).I believe Ludlum lost interest in completing the book and the publisher had to hire in some hack to finish the job, so they did it in the last 5 pages. Or...Ludlum lost himself in the maddening plot twists."
1,Save your money,I haven't read Ludlum in a while and it will be a long while before I read another. A totally disjointed spy story with a plot that appears to be concocked as the book was written. Not worthy of the author who wrote some great thrillers in the past.
1,What a dud.,"I can't *believe* all the positive professional reviews of this book -- unless they have all been written by slave-pawns of the international conspiracy Ludlum exposes.Omniscient or not, the hero was pretty good to figure out in the midst of hand-to-hand combat (p. 393): ""With a shrill scream, the harridan crouched and then sprang forward, her face contorted, her hands extended like claws, like deadly instruments. ... She pulled out a flashing blade, a long thin stiletto. It gleamed wetly, as if coated with a viscous fluid. He knew at once that the blade must be coated with the alkaloid toxiferene, which made it an extremely dangerous weapon. The slightest nick or scrape would lead to immediate paralysis and a suffocating death."""
2,Ludlum's spy like Robocop,"Our Superspy in this book keeps jumping from acting very smart to rather retarded. In one minute he pulls together obscure facts to solve a problem and the next he accepts statements of others that any Ludlum reader would seriously question. We all expect our Superspy's to be able to get out of seemingly inexcapable traps, but in this story he comes across more like Robocop rising from a nuclear attack. As a reader of Ludlum since the very beginnings, I expect my heros to use their brains and reasoning to solve the case with clues, facts and information in the story, even though those clues may be well hidden, and not pull solutions out of thin air. Sorry I spent the money for the hardback."
5,Spectacular!! Best since Bourne Identity..,"I keep waiting for something to spark my interest and make me feel my time has not been wasted. Finally!! This book has been the very best book I have read since ""The Bourne Identity "".To me, he reached his peak with ""The Bourne Identity"". I consider ""The Bourne Identity"" to be the greatest ""thriller"" I ever read.After some of his posthumous books have been a little shaky, but this really shines.Having read almost all of Ludlum's work, ""the Prometheus deception"" is clearly among Ludlum's best. Ludlums ideas of interrogation, planning and confusion are really what makes this book great to read . I simply can't say enough positives about this fantastic read."
4,The Prometheus Deception,"Although I enjoyed reading this novel, I felt that the author had resorted to non stop action instead of building a credible plot. There is no doudt that Ludlum is a fine author, but the fantasy of this book is way to far out to be believable. The indistructable nature of the hero is over done. If you like action, this will satisfy."
3,Thought-provoking and fast-paced,"I enjoyed the suspense and fast pace of this book. I got a little confused on some of the technical aspects and Ludlum stretches the believable factor a little, but it was still a good read. The premise is scary and thought-provoking, especially in the wake of 9/11."
2,"Starts with a Bang, Ends with a Fizzle","The premise is a good one. Covert agent discovers after being retired that he had been working for the wrong side all along. Enraged, he wants revenge, but finds he has been sentenced to death by whom? He isn't sure, but he sure knows how to duck trouble as he races from one bad position to another around the globe. The reader expects this pace to continue to the end. Unfortunately, it does not. About two thirds of the way through, the novel just dies. Seemingly important characters are just abandoned, and others which had little mention or priority seem to be reintroduced into major roles. The climax is tired with the big showy blast of a movie-of-the-week's stuntman's special effects.Rather than read this, I recommend one of the earlier works for which Ludlum is famous: The Bourne Identity, The Osterman Weekend, The Rhineman Exchange, to name a few."
3,Easy reading fantasy,"I haven't read Ludlum in several years, but I don't recall him as being this unbelievable. His protagonist gets into more impossible fixes and escapes through more coincidental miraculous rescues than Superman. One of my stars was awarded for predicting a year in advance the anthrax attack and plane downing. Another star was awarded for his insightful look at the future of privacy invasion emblematically depicted by his portrayal of Bill Gates and his smart house on Lake Washington. That leaves one star for the story without a trace of verisimilitude. Ludlum has done much better."
4,Relevant and incisive,"The book's narrator, private detective Lew Archer, is hired to find young Ronald Broadhurst, who has been kidnapped by his father and a younger woman. Of course the plot soon thickens, and Archer finds himself investigating murder, theft and conspiracies galore. A devastating forest fire rages throughout the book, just outside the margin of the action, but near enough to the story to create a consistent backdrop of urgency and fear.A hurried reader of Ross Macdonald's novel might mistake it for a relatively straightforward detective story, albeit a well-written one. However, this book is strikingly different from many others of the genre. Rather than highlighting action or intrigue, the book chooses to focus on human relationships and the ravages caused by divorce and greed.Though the plot moves slowly in parts, Macdonald's surprisingly trenchant commentary on devastated relationships and societal decay is as vibrant and relevant today as it was 30 years ago."
4,Are you too young to appreciate Ross MacDonald,"This is my favorite Ross MacDonald book of all. Delighted it is being reprinted. Think I have an original copy. Read it in context of when written, but also Ross is a very good writer. Grow Up you people in the 90's. Or better yet, take me back to a ""super"" time for crime/detectives."
1,Good reading for someone with a third grade education,"I would not recommend anyone buy this book, even if they find it at a garage sale for a dime. The plot is fine but the characters are unbeliveable. After 60 pages I finally quit reading and gave up. At the end of 60 pages, this bozo of a PI had uncovered a murder and a kidnapping and had not yet called the police in on the case. You have got to be kidding me. I left him on a boat being held at gun point. Good place for him. There was no timeframe in the book I could find. No dates, no current events discussed. I would surmise it was in the 50's or 60's considering the way women were portrayed at wimpie little braindeads. And of course, the male detective was just ever soooo coool all the time. Stay away from this work of art, unless you like those banal, brainless and boring gothic love stories. You know the type, with the big breasted woman on the front, looking oh so distressed in front of a gothic mansion."
5,A TREASURE CHEST,"This book is a treasure chest of professional photographs and anecdotes. This book has something for everyone, from the inveterate Beatles' fan to people who are becoming familiar with them. This book is indeed a masterpiece that will long register in the minds of those who read it."
1,Stopped working after 2 days -- returning,"Returning. Stopped working after two days and about six hours total. All of a sudden, just no green light and the adapter will no longer work. Was powering an IBM Thinkpad R50."
4,Just Buy It !!,"Don't waste too much time deciding whether or not to purchase this little gem, JUST BUY IT!!. Considering the retail price (thanks Dover) you will definitly get much more than your moneys worth out of this book. So why four stars? I chose to rate Dixon's text at the level of fours stars because of my selfish desire of wishing Dixon had included more problems. It actually deserves five stars. Dixon has done an excellent job of compiling a relatively wide assortment of problems (from subgroups to representations), some problems are routine, some clever, some subtle and some difficult. But all together, the provided assortment of problems in this book have been a complete joy to work through and I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in group theory, to those who enjoy straining their brains while working through mathematical problems and to those graduate students who are studying for qualifying exams."
4,Great,"This is a labal comp, Tribe records, and is stuffed with jazz and funk. All the music ranges from very good to outragiously excelent.Check out, for example, ""What We Need,"" a fantastic vocal track with a dark blues ballad base. This alone makes this worth owning, and is just a sliver of what you get on this CD.Labal comps are a great way to expose you to music you would never find anywhere else, and Message To The Tribe easily rises to the top of the pecking order."
4,THE KNACK OF SELLING YOURSELF,A spirited book of the old school of motivation by a remarkable author. His passion for his subject is impressive and stimulating. A worth-while read.
2,A waste of money!,"A waste of money. Spend a bit more and get something that the kids might actually play with. The paper barn is a total joke and on one of the sets that I bought, it didn't even have the tabs to put it together. The horses are boring and my children didn't care for it. The Melissa and Doug horse toys are more durable and my children love them."
5,Happy Days Jukebox is Fantastic!,Happy Days Jukebox is so much fun!! Anyone who has grown up watching the show Happy Days is going to love this CD. I even know young kids who enjoy the oldies on this CD. All of the Nick-at-Nite records CD's are wonderful. You would enjoy any of them. Another good CD is Dick Van Dyke's Dance Party by Nick-at-Nite records. Enjoy!!
4,Getting better...,"This book was pretty cool. I can now forgive Anderson for his blunder with Return to Ord Mantell. The plot really picked up, and we saw some of the stuff that makes Anderson and Moesta such worty keepers of the Star Wars flame. I hope thy don't mess up with Crisis on Crystal Reef. I hope to give that one a five!"
5,The Force was totally in this book!,I cannot believe all the action and suspense in this book. Kevin and Rebecca did an awesome job. The rides were shere genius. If I could give this book six stars I would. Jacen and Jaina did an awesome job of protecting there friends in this book.!
3,Not that interesting.,"This book was just not as interesting as the previous books. It was also shorter than most. It was only about 180 pages. Lando comes across pretty hokey and there were to many movie redos from Empire. It seemed like the authors tried to fit as many ESB referencesa as possible. Oh well if you can find a copy and want to read the complete series do so, otherwise not a must read at all."
3,A worthwhile book,"While not one of the most stellar books in the Young Jedi Knight series, it does help to close the series and mark significant character growth for the young Jedi that would become central the Star Wars Universe."
4,career management for the creative person,"Lee Silber has a gift for communicating a complex group of ideas and thoughts in a simple and practical way. The exercises, quotes and fast facts make this a great tool for real life applications. This book is very encouraging to people at all stations of the work place. I was able to apply many of these ideas and tecniques even within a government agency. Lee was able to be reached on-line and gracious enough to lend further support and edification. Thanks Lee!"
3,Repeat information; but still helpful,"Though I believe this book came first, I read the ""Self-Promotion"" book before this one. I found that a lot of the stories are repeated. But, this book does eventually give some good tips and advice. This book is also not geared towards someone like me who has recently lost their job. Silber spends a lot of time in the book assesing if the reader is right-brained or left-brained, and if they're ready to go into a creative career. I had no choice when I was downsized. And, I already knew I was a right-brainer. So, I had to skim over those chapters. Other than that though, I found the book to be helpful. Silber is an excellent writer, and always keeps the reader entertained. I found many ways to make Phillustrations.com a more successful venture."
5,A MUST BUY,"Lee Silber has done it again, writing an excellent help guide for any writer or artist, or anyone who is even remotely thinking of becoming one. Silber provides icredible insight, energy, and confidence on a friendly, conversation level that I think the masses can easily relate to. Who else could find one venue to meld anecdotes from the likes of Jimmy Buffett, Ally Sheedy, William Shakespeare, and Ryan Leaf? Even if you aren't an aspiring creative, you'll love all of the little stories and advice Silber provides. It's a very entertaining reading, and he's obviously done his homework."
3,Bowling,"There was nothing wrong with the book, I just was not pleased by the way they shipped it. Going through the mail, the whole book got bent and corners got bent. I wish they would have emailed it in a box rather then a bubble wrap envelope."
4,Okay,The cover was bent and it took a wee bit longer than I anticipated. But when I bought it I was told it was used.
5,Pat shows why the U.S. should not get into foreign wars !!!,"This book is a wonderful, historical account of the many different scenarios regarding the role of the United States in foreign wars. Washington's great rule as shown by Pat was to avoid European wars unless it directly affected the United States. The current media emphasis on the WWII controversy is unwarranted. Pat merely uses history to make his argument, that America should be making the decisions concerning war, not some foreign treaty or pre-ordained arrangement. I thought it was a very eye-opening read and would recommend any open-minded person to read it."
2,More political posturing than history,"Writing as that rarest of commentators, a professional historian, I want to start off by saying that Buchanan's section on the history and misuse of the term ""isolationism"" is fairly accurate. However, that's one of the book's few virtues.Buchanan shows a complete inability to grasp the simple concept that Hitler's aims were in no way rational. He would _not_ have been satisfied with a slice of the Soviet Union. He had commissioned a bomber that was capable of reaching New York, with the stated objective of a possible US invasion.Buchanan never gives a satisfactory answer as to why he thinks Vietnam and Korea were justifiable wars of containment, but World War II wasn't. And while his grasp of history might be shaky, even he must surely be aware that it's political suicide to position yourself as a Nazi apologist."
1,total complete rigfht ling propaganda,"this guy is a nut. he complains about the liberal media, yet he's sleeping with the enemy. what do you think enables him to spout his conservative drivel on CNN? The liberal media..."
1,Disgraceful.,"Admirers of Pat Buchanan will be hard-pressed to defend their hero's latest book, a pro-Hitler tirade that makes the arguement that America was unjustified to go to war with Nazi Germany and should have left Hitler's legions to roam about Europe.Buchanan's sickening admiration of Hitler, a man the author has called in the past ""a genius"" & ""a statesman"", comes through time and again. Perhaps the most disgusting part of the book is Buchanan's claim that Hitler wanted to be America's friend, a theory based on Buchanan's interpretation of ""Mein Kampf"". Buchanan, alas, ignores historical tidbits such as Hitler's ""Z Plan"", a construction program of aircraft carriers and battleships, coupled with the acqusition of air and naval bases in the Atlantic, was part of a concerted effort to prepare for the war against America that Hitler wanted to fight.Buchanan's reading of history is all wrong and his admiration of Hitler makes any decent person sick. Shame, Pat. Shame."
5,Why is the Truth so Unpopular?,"Buchannan's view of world history is fresh and inspiring so much so you will want to read more about the history that effects our lives today. The future is rooted in the past and we can all learn from it, ignore it we are destined to be doomed by the repetiton of our past failures. His argument that we fought the wrong war in WWII bears some merit. Helping the communmists gave the world 50 years and the death of another 50 million people through communist terror. That is Buchannan's view of the context of current history. He goes back to the Revolutionay War and does the same by challeging traditional views. Refreshing."
4,A new evil empire,"Buchanan demonstrates with great persuasiveness that the infantile, hubristic and destructive chaos wreaked by this administration in Somalia, Haiti and Kosovo is only a culmination of a century of global social work masquerading as foreign policy, in which an internationalist, Anglophile, and zionist elite has systematically destroyed any meaning of a US national interest. This has resulted in the inability of Europe to reach a stable distribution of power after WWI, an alliance with the bolsheviks in the inevitable WWII, and a cold war which contained the west more than the east. All the while world citizens like Strobe Talbott advocating the end of the nation state travel on US passports, not those of the trilateral commission where their allegiance really lies.... END"
5,The path we should be taking,Pat's book is great. It points out how American should be placing her self in this world. This path would let us make the choice to help those we need too. With out putting us in danger. At no time does Pat say we should not help others just to make that choice case by case. Pat does a great job of being even handed and holding your mind.
5,The old fire-brand is at it again!,"Those of you who've read ""The Great Betrayal"" by this author will enjoy this title too. Isn't it interesting how ""America First"" isn't a popular idea anymore? Well, Pat's all for America, and not an 'isolationist' America. His points are well taken on the historical record of American foreign policy, at least what it was before the 'sea-change' after the Second World War. .... He's right in saying that Germany in 1940 was not a threat to us (America). We didn't get into WWII to 'make the world safe for democracy'; we did it for the money (the bankers). Pat's book is a call to return to the foreign policy America had prior to 1950 -- to try to avoid entanglements overseas. That's going to be a tough sell today."
1,It is all Americas fault,"Read the better german verison frist. Pat sings a song of america and it's duchland, duchland uber allas. The shear refusal to see that the World War One not World War Two bankupted the britsh empire is the basis for this rant and it gets worse. Pat also see to see that was the opinion of the domnions fear full that the chamberlin might sell them out when the japanese moved south that forced a change of policy. Also I am no fan of Mao but Pat again fails to see that it was Mao success in maintaing a fighting force against the japanese from 1937 to 1945 gave him the basis for power not any thing america did. Indeed, Gen. George Marshall spend month in china in 1946 trying to arange for a cease fire and poltical settlement."
1,Lost in the translation,I think this book loses something in the translation. It probably makes more sense in the original German.
1,Another rewrite of history,Mr. Buchanan has once again proven that he does not know what he's talking or writing about...but at least he's finally showing his true colors. It's nice to know that old Pat is a Nazi sympathizer because that explains everything about this man. Only in Free Speech America could someone get away with this garbage. And this guy's running for President? Heaven help us all!
5,A long awaited Americanist plan for peace and freedom.,"It is difficult to understand the shrieks of fear and dismay from critics of Buchanan. They obviously haven't read the book. Pat has given a fascinating history course with many interesting new sidelights about America's past to peak your interest. He has succeeded in exposing the New World Order cabal without having to use the ""C"" word. (The imminent dangers are the same no matter what you call it.) If enough voters are exposed to this information I think ANY third party could become the majority party and this appears to be the Buchanan strategy. A similar wakeup call about our loss of sovereignty comes from the book ""Michael New - Mercenary or American Soldier"""
4,More historical than critical,"Pat Buchanan, an ardent supporter of solid, but cautious foreign policy, has written an excellent account of the policies of the United States overseas. In beginning this work, I had expected to hear a greater degree of persuasion throughout the book, championing Washington's Farewell Address. While this was referenced throughout, I encountered much more history than I was anticipating, but was pleased it was there, as it lent an importance to his argument for the present and the future. Buchanan weaved his way carefully through America's history, complete with discussions of the Monroe Doctrine, Manifest Destiny, the great wars, and up to the very recent past. Anyone concerned about the future of America's military and its future, as I am being 22 years old, should read this masterful discussion, regardless of one's political affiliation."
4,Read the book before rendering an irresponsable judgement,"I fail to understand how the mainstream media, Sen. McCain, and others have construed Mr. Buchanan's arguement against English and French strategy in WWII(i.e. appease Hitler and intervene only after he has the strategic advantage) to be anti-semetic, pro-Hitler, anti-American or any other such nonsense. Read the book jabronies, and quit shooting your damn mouths off over nothing."
1,Mildly confused...,"Let me see if I understand. Buchanan says that foreign entanglements are bad. Buchanan also says that WW2 came about because England didn't meet its treaty obligations - in other words, they weren't entangled enough. If he addresses this contradiction anywhere in his book, I must have missed that page...the rambling tone put me to sleep after a while. Is it just me, or is it starting to look like Patsy isn't quite as smart as he thinks he is? This book will appeal to those readers who prefer sound bites to rational thought. It should be a huge seller, sadly enough."
1,Isolationism is not for this century,I don't think any American should question that our actions in World War II were anything but justified. We needed to fight Hitler. Period. That's part of what it means to be American.
1,America knows better,"300 pages of trash and anti-semitic nonsense. He implores Anericans to ""read more Hitler"" literature before rushing to judgement. How truly ridiculous. How would one be able to have any understanding of deranged pieces of work written by one of the most deranged person mankind had known. Buchanan is nowhere to be found on the American left-center-right political spectrum. He is on the fringe of the political right and he appeals only to low-income, lowly-educated men and women who prefers to blame all their problems on immigrants, Jews, colored people, and of course the ""elites"". America knows better."
1,Buchanan spouts more bigotry,"Buchanan's new book spouts more bigotry that the US can do without. If his views prevail, America will see another slave-state form from the Whitehouse down. We as a nation will go back in time 150 years or more and enter a new period of inhumane darkness."
1,No Pat No!,"This book should be baned, and its reader shot! The Government shouldn't allow people to read anyway. This book will cause the ignorant fools who think they are free to fall out of lockstep with their designated partys. We must have a New World Order!!"
5,A Proper Perspective on our Global Role,This was the most insightful book that I have read in the last 5 years. The book gave me a new interpretation of what the fouding fathers envisioned for our Republic. It is historically accurate and statements are backed up with historical fact. Anyone who would like to learn more about what our role in this world was originally intended to be should read this book. It also gives a new perspective on how free trade has affected the world and what it is doing to our great country. I highly recommend it!
5,Pat Buchanan - American patriot and genius,"Pat Buchanan is a genius and a fighter for all causes inportant to America. This book deals with the loss of American sovereignty to the global ""new world order"" one-world government. Pat strikes a chord on this topic, as evidenced by the recent protests at the WTO meetings in Seattle. Americans don't want a one-world government, despite what the Clinton administration would have you believe.As for the anti-semitism or Hitler-loving, it is non-existent in this book. While Buchanan does question America's involvement in European WWII, he also challenges America's reasons for entering many other foreign conflicts.A great read for anyone who loves their country and their history. Vote for Pat to save the U.S.A.GO PAT GO!"
2,Disappointment.....,"I am a HUGE Richard Laymon fan, but any intelligent reader will recognize this as one of his absolute worst efforts. The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever read in any book, not just Laymon's. Shallow characters. Surprisingly not that much gore. Too much sex for a book about mostly adolescents.If you want to read Laymon, read The Traveling Vampire Show."
1,Worst Halloween Book Ever?,"Since Halloween is my favorite time of year, I was expecting a great spook fest. What I got was one of the worst books on the planet. The situations and dialog make any Ed Wood movie (which is what came to mind) look like an Oscar winner."
4,A cult and a ghost!,"This book is not about a serial killer like in Halloween. It is about a ghost in a haunted house and something a little different- a cult that sacrifices children on All Hallow's Eve. Speaking of which, it is an 8 year old child that saves the day (with some help from the local SWAT team) when he is told the combination on the gun lock. I ordered this book from the United States and paid 80 Australian dollars for it and i must say it wasn't worth it but this book isn't available in Australia that i know of for some reason.This is not one of Laymon's best, but it is not one of his worst either."
1,This goes to -11.,"I hate to be mean, but this is one of the absolute worst books I have ever read. I found myself hoping that this was one big joke (maybe someone will show me that this is the case). To be fair, I should mention that this is his first book I have read.Anyway, let me explain why I find this book bad. First, no interesting characters. Second, how many times can he write the word breast in one book? I felt like I was reading a Penthouse Letter. Someone should tell Mr. Laymon that he does not need to describe the movements of a character's breasts in every instance. Third, there was no need to discuss how horny a 13-year-old girl was feeling. Fourth, why the need for almost every character to be naked? I am no puritan, but that was excessive. Finally (not really finally, but I am running out of time), the dialogue was awful. I won't provide any examples because the entire book is one big example of how to write poor dialogue."
5,Great product.,"We're novices at epoxy casting, but this arrived quickly and worked easily. We would gladly purchase from this vendor again."
2,Bubbles and not clear,"I bought this stuff and then didn't do anything with it for about six months, so it sat in its box in a closet the whole time.Finally got around to using it. Rather disappointed so far. First off, the finished product is yellow, not clear like the box says. Maybe it has to do with the age, which is why I mentioned it above. Still, 6 months and it's no good? How long are my finished pieces going to last?It looks like a white wine or champagne. That might sound good but it's not! The impression is something weathered and cheap. Don't bother with this stuff unless you plan to use dye.Second, bubbles everywhere! Every time! Forget what the instructions say. Plan for bubbles on EVERY pour. Make sure you have a heat gun or blow dryer handy. Even then, I was still getting stray bubbles. I've followed the instructions to the letter, and failing that, tried a few slight variations. Still get a few bubbles every time. At best my final pieces are going to be second-rate with this product."
2,Would not buy again,I have used a few different resin mixes and this is the worst of them all.It took 5 days to dry out to the point where it would come off the cast (it is sticky if not completely dry/hard). The air bubbles never disappeared. Buy another brand.P.S. The product is indeed low odor.
2,Ruins a Good Book -,"""Catch-22"" is one of the funniest books I've ever read - it captures the nuttiness of the military very well. The Cliffs Notes, however, comes up with insights and perspectives that just make reading the book a drag. Read the book, skip the notes."
1,Nothing to see here,"This 'article' is nothing more than a series of bullet points describing topics that should be discussed. However, there is nothing actually discussed in this article."
5,Collin Raye Christmas: The Gift,"This Christmas CD is my favorite. Listening to every track, it is obvious that so much work went into each song. Collin's voice is incredible! Collin's daughter, Britanny, sings 'Silent Night' and 'Away in a Manger' with her Dad.....absolutely beautiful. 'The Gift' is magical, and very much deserving of the 5 stars I rated it. Thank you Collin for your gift!"
5,Collin Raye The Gift,"This is definetely my favorite Christmal album, I hear it every year.Collin's beautiful voive is fit to sing Chritmas songs. This CD is a must have in your Christmas album Collection."
5,"Collin Raye, Christmas Gift","I love all things Collins Raye but this album is truely special. It comes from deep in his heart and you feel it as you listen. My favorite track is ""Oh Holy Night"" I've listened to the track so many times I know every note, every word, and every breath he takes. It sends chills down me and makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. What a wonderful feeling this album gives the listeners."
5,Such A Great Christmas Album!,"Whether you are a country western fan or not, Collin Raye sings some pretty amazing Christmas Songs! This album is in the top 5 of what I listen to every year during the holiday season! It makes a great gift!"
5,you NEED to add this to your collection!,"Collin Raye is always an exceptional performer, so it was no surprise that this CD is so great! This is music that everyone should listen to during the Christmas season."
1,Flounder Flopping Around,"Sorry but, after thawing, breading, and frying these filetsI found the flesh to be very mushy with no flavor oftheir own. I won't try them again."
2,It didn't last,"I loved this product for its many functions. It is not yet one year old, however, and has had a complete failure of all systems. The warranty is only for 90 days, so I'm out of luck. The Sony people gave me an address to take it to for repairs (parts, not labor, are still under warranty) but could not give me a phone number for the service center! I was told they did not have one and left to fend for myself. It did not cost enough to track down this service center and hope the repairs cost less than the purchase price."
5,I loved it!,"I am an avid reader, but never before read any ""true crime"". The story seemed unreal, but I know it is true. I have to admit that the writing was riddled with errors, but the story itself kept the pages turning very fast. I, too, thought it should be made into a movie -- with the characters too odd to be made up. I would recommend it to anyone NOT faint of heart."
1,"Half a star, if possible","Prior to this book, I had only given up on one other book in my entire reading life.I made it all the way to page 33 and just couldn't deal with it. I had seen a special on TV about this subject, which piqued my interest. I went looking for more info, and found this. I guess I didn't look hard enough.The reviewers before me have said most of what I would say. All I can add is that my particular disappointment was that the story was too ""one-track minded,"" forgive the choice of words. I was already aware there was much more to both the riding scene and the criminal element. I guess I expected a deeper treatment of the topic.Sorry if this isn't the greatest written review. I don't do it often. But, this one I coudn't leave alone. I felt a sort of responsibility to the reading public! Thanks for reading."
5,Loved It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I loved this book! I am not a big fiction reader but this book was awesome. A must read!
1,disappointed with product,"I am giving one star only because it is the lowest I can give. I so looked forward to this cookie gun. I was tired of the cheap ones not working. It looked great and felt like it would last for many years. After putting it together and loading it with dough, the coupling that holds the disc came off after the third cookie came out. I reattached it thinking I hadn't assembled it correctly. Again it happened. And again. I have been using cookie guns for over 25 years and never had this problem. If this detaching problem could be addressed, I think it would be a decent product."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this cookies press after several other presses failed to do the job. Well this one doesn't work either. The coupling that holds the disks pops off the barrel from the pressure of the cookie dough. The barrel and the coupling are not threaded which is the cause of the problem. I bought a Mercado cookie press and that did the job!!
4,So far so good,My cookie press was delivered pretty quickly and I couldn't wait to use it. I have made two batches of cookies so far. The cookies look and taste great. The only problem I have had with the press is that the end holding the cookie stencils pops off when I am pressing out the cookie dough. Maybe I just need more practice.
2,a disappointment,"I own other Kaiser products, and was looking forward to enjoying this one. However, it is clunky, not easy to use and I sent it back post haste! I own a Kuhn Rikon which is not perfect, but usable. The cookie press is a product that needs to be re-invented, I think."
1,Top gets unlocked and pops off from tube,"Ordered this in September to make sure I'd have it for Christmas! Looked great online... Top and bottom each screw on and ""lock"" onto the tube section. It makes a few cookies and it ends up that either end will pop off - somehow it becomes ""unlocked"" as it ratchets down onto the dough. Big disappointment!"
4,Missing one essential,"The cookie press is first rate, constructed of stainless steel, rather than flimsy plastic, plus it's easy to use. The only shortcoming is the lack of a place to store the disks. It would have made sense, to provide some form of container, for disk storage. As it is, they tend to get misplaced."
4,Retro-metal,"This album is not a masterpeice, by any definition although it grows on you. Very heavily influenced from the ""Master of reality"" era Black Sabbath. Very rich,thick, guitar work,but they don't achieve the evil licks Tony Iommi created.The bass performed by a babe named Ginger is strong old school metal.The vocals are the classic style, a cross between Iron Maiden & Dio.""King of kings"" is an infectious tune (about Alexander the Great} All in all enjoyable party music {avoid the last track though,a long,forgetable drum solo} The main reason I give it four stars is because you can tell the band truly loves this kind of music. They are not great but they have passion."
4,Insightful!,"Business books are often informative, but rarely entertaining. Lucky for all of us, Andrew Frothingham's latest book on public speaking manages to integrate both objectives into one clear, concise and funny book. He splits the book into two parts: ""About Speaking"" and ""Gems You Can Use."" The first part presents the author's wisdom on effective speech making. He cites rules, pointers and strategies to build your toolkit for designing and delivering great speeches. The second part of the book is composed of well-known quotes grouped into logical speech topic areas such as education, ethics and marriage. Taken together, the two parts of this book form an educational and enjoyable read. Virtually any speaker will find valuable tips and useful quotes for a future presentation. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who ever has to give a speech (at the last minute, or not) or to anyone who just likes enlightening tips and quotes."
5,Zero problems.,Have used these for 3 years on an '06 Ninja 250. Bought this brand based on recommendations from ninja250.org. It does what it's supposed to do.
4,A great book for young train lovers---wonderful pictures!,"I am not usually a fan of rhyming books, but this one was an exception. My son, who is a big train lover, has listened to it many, many times. The pictures are the best part---they really make you nostalgic for the days when trains like the ones depicted were in more common use."
5,Rhythm to reading,"We bought this for our grandchildren (ages 2 and 5) and had the pleasure of reading it to them several times over the holidays. The effect on them was great - like with our daughters many years ago. They love trains already and the book encouraged them to look (and listen) deeper. The illustrations and words drew them to the page while giving us opportunities to ask questions and add more information. Lots of requests to ""read it again.""Here's what really elevates this book : it allows the reader to introduce rhythm to the reading, play with the timing and pronunciation in the reading, and pass this joy along to the child. As much fun for us as for them!"
3,Train loving son.,"My 2 year old is obsessed with trains. I thought this book would be a hit, but it really wasn't. I wasn't sure what tune to sing the song to, or is it a poem? He lost interest in it fast."
2,4X closer to Large. Not true plus size.,"The sizing chart is off and these shirts run many sizes too small. I measured as a 2X, usually am a 3X, but ordered a 4X for extra room. The shirt was skin tight, closer to a Large. Maybe the regular sizes are correct, but the plus sizes are way too small. I would have liked them if they fit. I never would have ordered them if the size chart was accurate."
2,hmmm,This Fish bowl looks way bigger in the picturethen what it really is... a small gold fish isperfect for this but a beta fish or a regularsized gold fish looks cramped in that tinyfish bowl... not at all satisfied...
4,Leaks,"It is a good product for one who doesn't want to spend alot of money on a bunch of different size moulds but there are two downsides, it leaks through the bottom especially with liquids since the adjusting rings make it uneven, also it isn't a perfect circle unless it is extended to its full size so its partially an oval. You can bake with this but for batters it isn't recommended since it leaks out half the batter by the time it sets it the oven (even with it wrapped in aluminum foil). Decent product overall"
4,Great book full of ideas,Some ideas are not all that original but there are a few things in here that will help you find insperation for your Halloween parties and costums. Some party activities are lots of fun. Overall a very fun book with great illustrations and all color photos.
4,"Strong Story, Great Actors, a little flat in execution","First off, I loved this story. Great idea, some very good writing, and two actors who are clearly both skilled in their craft and who worked hard to execute the story's goals. It also shines in the slow, methodical way it develops, and the time the writer/director is willing to take to let ideas and interactions develop. Moving and heart-felt.That being said, the film needed a little more editing, and perhaps a couple of scenes needed more time to gel/come together. Sometimes the actors are spot-on, and sometimes the scenes feel rough-hewn - like they needed more time to hit the right tone/cadence.Definitely a B+, and a keeper. Looking forward to the next work by this writer/director. And off to look for other work by both actors."
4,"low budget, but moving little tale","This little tale of lost love found is low budget & the acting is below par, but the story ultimately moved me. The story also makes references to ""Brokeback Mountain"" in a cheesy way. Two teenage boys had a tentative love for each other, but the one moved away from the small town, while the other stayed. When one returns and re-discovers his roots and ultimately his continued desire for the other fella, their subsequent reunion will bring a tear to your eye. Forget the production values, the hokiness of some parts; just enjoy the tenderness displayed between the protagonists."
4,Touching and sentimental!,"I really enjoyed this film - I thought it was very moving, and quite lovely - made even more so by the actors being ordinary-looking guys, who find each other, and, at first, are just as awkward as they were as adolescents. But love conquers all - and it does in the end. I would highly recommend it for viewing by all gay men. I do not mean to exclude others, just that gay men would more readily relate to it."
2,"Nice concept, poor delivery","I watched this film with someone else rather than purchasing it myself, but wanted to review it anyway, in the hopes that it would save someone else the disappointment of actually paying for it. I really wanted to like the film because I liked the premise. Unfortunately, what could have been a very good and heartwarming story turned out to be painful to watch and downright laughable in places because of the disastrous combination of cliched dialogue and poor acting. If you're really interested in a heartwarming gay love story, watch Shelter. You can hardly beat that one. Or, try Save Me with Robert Gant and Chad Allen."
1,You'll be sorry...,"Great cover, but the acting and filming was so ""painful"". This must be someone's first film. I feel really let down considering the DVD carried an ""Official Selection"" logo. Thank goodness the DVD was on sale! Don't buy it for more than $5.00! Or better yet, I'll send you my copy free!"
1,I never got this product,I wish I could review this one but I never got it....I got another film instead. Not living in the US I had it sent to a cousin's house way in advance (as I was going to visit him) and never discovered the mix-up until it was too late to send it back...
2,ARIZONA SKY...no sky rockets,"I was hopeful reading reviews for this dvd but after purchasing a used copy (I am glad I bought used)What a let down.Ok first off I can deal with low buget and sets that scream it,but when the script yo-yo's sooo flatly ouch!The ""Lost love"" could be reasonably good looking I kept thinking shave & haircut the whole movie.The lead being a ""Big Shot""whatever was too weak to believe he could have such a job.Way too much of this movie was spent on these two not being able to face what they each wanted,just not well done .It could have been a really good story,but not this dvd....Get ""SHELTER"" if you want a well done DVD."
2,Get out your cliche checklist,"For some reason, I had it in my mind that this was supposed to be good. It wasn't. The real entertainment for us was making fun of it as it went along, adding in our own running commentary in the MST 3000 style.I believe the film maker had noble intent to tell a story of two men reconnecting. But the acting, aside from Jake (Eric Dean) was comically bad. I mean BAD. I found it painful to watch many of the scenes, in that they were directed as if to radio dialogues. The characters remained frozen in place, delivering predictable lines. The emotional overplay on the part of ""Kyle"" was laughable. Lastly, the inclusion of Jake's Friend ""Brian"" should have been left back at home. I never did figure out why he was part of the visit back to Jake's hometown.This film takes the lead in our running BGFF (Bad Gay Film Festival). That said, it may be fun for party viewing, as it is unintentionally funny."
4,Review and Correction,"An excellent CD for classic cartoon Christmas songs. I'd prefer the Muppets not be included... and, hey, they're not cartoons anyway. Singing credit for the Grinch song, however, goes to Thurl Ravenscroft, not Boris Karloff. Boris only did the Grinch's voice. Mr. Ravenscroft (also the Tony the Tiger voice (""They're Great!"")) never got credit listed on the film. A big mistake."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Robin Goldsby style is so original and so compelling, that this recording sounds fresh listen after repeated listen. I first heard Goldsby play in the mid-80's in an elegant New York City piano room, and stopped dead in my tracks upon hearing her rendition of ""Vincent"" (Starry, Starry Night) which is included here. Goldsby's keen sense of rhythm keeps the album moving, yet she manages to tailor her phrases delicately and gracefully making this a recording, well, *beautiful*! Being a professional pianist myself, people are always asking me what I like to listen to. This. I like to listen to this. *****"
5,Lovely Melodies,"These are solo piano arrangements of melodies that I love, songs that I've played for years in the places I wrote about in my book Piano Girl. Hope you like them, too. My personal favorite is Starry Starry Night.Piano Girl: A Memoir"
2,Disappointing,I heard the artist interviewed on Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz and was charmed by her story. Unfortunately what appears on this CD (and I can't speak for other CDs) is the sort of anemic cocktail lounge playing that won't offend anyone but will rather appeal to the soft jazz fan while boring the jazz aficionado.
5,great downer noir novel,I read this book years ago when I was in high school and was blown away. I was just beginning to get into writers like Jim Thompson and Chester Himes and thought this stood up well compared to their work. I lost this book some time ago and am quite happy that it has been reprinted so that I can read it again and see if my original impression still holds true.
1,Looks like barney,I HATE this gorgosaurus!!!!!!! It looks like barney!!!!!!!!! It SHOULD be called the wild safari barney!!!!!!!!!! I would NOT reccomend it unless you like barney!!!!
4,Good value for the money!,"The book covers KVM, CLDC and all the API's of MIDP 1.0. The chapters have a lot of examples of the most important and difficult features of the API's. The author has focused on the essential things and so the book doesn't have hundreds and hundreds of unnecessary pages. A good book that's in use every day."
2,Ripley's Believe it Or Not Copycat,"This video is just like Ripley's Believe it or Not. All the stuff is about people who can fit 8 golfballs into their mouth at once, and half dog, half human people. It's pretty stupid but some parts are okay.I didnt like it. I choose to watch Ripley's the TV show."
4,Southern delight!!,"Miss Julia Takes Over was a fun book!! This is the story of a staid upright member of the community who manages to keep all things in their proper places, and never (well rarely) loses her composure or fails to maintain proper decorum. Julia must discover where her housemate, Hazel Marie, has disappeared to before Hazel Marie's son Lloyd is taken into the protective custody of her Uncle Vern, a born again Tel-Evangelist in search of Lloyd's trust fund. Through an outrageous turn of events involving NASCAR, gambling, a wild nurse, a private investigator with a huge mustache and a minister with a private agenda, Julia learns that true love can exist and realizes that it can be worth fighting for!! Miss Julia is a good ole' Southern delight!!!"
3,Ok.,I was slightly disappointed after waiting such a long time for the sequel. I can only hope that Miss Julia Throws a Wedding will renew my faith in Ann Ross. I was very disappointed with how Miss Julia's character played a more subdued and less authoriative person in this book.
4,On the road again!!,"I am thoroughly enjoying the Miss Julia series, by Ann B. Ross, but have to say honestly, that in this particular book, the main character seemed to be ""out-of-character"" at times.With that said, I fell in love with little Lloyd in this book, watching him blossom and grow confident under the loving cloak of Miss Julia, Lillian and the more masculine characters that develop in this latest edition. I'm eager to continue reading through this series to see what happens next!"
3,Miss Julia Takes Over,This was my first book in the series of Miss Julia.It was funny.I enjoyed reading it.Julia sure knows how to figure things out.
4,Quaint,"Kind of quaint and old-fashioned but enjoyable characters for whom you cheer. Nice to see a woman ""of a certain age"" as the central character and the deft way in which the author educates her and brings out her ability to think for and believe in herself and the people around her."
5,another hilarious Miss Julia adventure,"When Hazel Marie doesn't return from a movie date with Wilson T. Hodge, Miss Julia sets out to find her. Unable to get the proper help from the police department, she hires the private investigator, J.D. Pickens. Insisting on tagging along while he tries to find Hazel Marie, Miss Julia finds herself in all sorts of interesting situations as they follow the trail of clues. Just as funny as Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind, this book is completely hilarious and entertaining."
4,Miss Julia Takes Over,"This is a delightful, easy read. Miss Julia is a person that we all probably know someone just like and we insert that picture in our head. She is old time polite and knows the RIGHT way things must be done. And since she obviously knows whats right it just stands to reason that she should get the job done---snd she does!"
3,Obviously a Sequel,"Obviously a sequel, this book should have just been called Miss Julia II. And I find that it lacks the charm and the ""AHA!"" moments of the earlier book, when Miss Julia was figuring it all out and learning to do things her way. This story was really more a Miss Julia meets the Keystone Cops kind of foolishness, and really found nothing especially interesting this round. The new family unit of Miss Julia, Hazel Marie & Little Lloyd is interesting, but descended into slapstick this go round. If you just loved the first Miss Julia, and really need another fix, go for it. But otherwise, I'd recommend waiting for the paperback."
3,Miss Julia the Sequel,"This story took a little longer to get into than the first (Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind), and in the first chapters I found Miss Julia a little trite and annoying. But once the plot got fired up, I was once again in love with her character. The scene where she outraces the bad guys on the NASCAR racetrack is the best in the book. I read the first two books back to back, and, while I enjoyed them both, I think I will take a break before picking up Miss Julia III."
5,Can't believe this great book is out of print,"This is a really good book that kids AND their parents will enjoy. It is bound to be a book often requested by your kids, but you won't mind reading it over and over again. A good story and very good illustrations."
2,Disappointed,The stories in this picture book are lovely to read but as this is a picture book I was really disapointed by the black and white illustrations. The shading is mostly dark to very dark and does not do justice to the stories inside invoking any kind of atmosphere. The writing was also of an uneven print quality making the book look like a poor photocopy sandwiched between a hardcover binding. For $40 I would have expected the description to have mentioned the lack of colour illustrations.
2,EXTREMELY Simplistic,"If you are a COMPLETE novice then this book is for you. But, if you have any experience at all with stocks, bonds, trading, etc. then I would pass on this book. The writing style is written for the junior high school level. I would buy Chuck Carlson's book for a more advanced approach to DRIP's and DIP's."
2,Too Simplistic,I didn't enjoy this book that much. I think that maybe it was because I had already had some expirience with investing prior to reading this book. There are other books out there that gave me more information. This book is also very limited in the places it gives you to start investing your $10 a week. I also found that most of those places want much more than $10 to start a drip account. Not bad for a first time investor though.
2,Very much a book for beginners,"This is a book that may be for the very beginning investor. Some good information, but most of it is covered by ""cute"" sayings. I agree with the other reviewer that this writing style is probably more for women than men."
4,great and easy to read !!,"its a great and easy to read book, found info very, very helpful....read the book one night and started researching DRIPS the next!!!"
2,Not worth the hype,Chillow is impossible to fill without getting everything all wet. It's too heavy when all the water is in it. It is too cold at first and then warms up just when it needs to be cold. Sounded like a good idea but was very disappointing.
3,One of the Best I've seen on the Subject,"While I did not read the entire book, but most of it I give it a great primer on for parents on raising their children. I don't agree on his doctrinal beliefs in Scripture (their not dispensational); I do agree on his stance of teaching children in a manner that I believe will work today if using the correct discernment in every situation.Overall, I would recommmend it and have bought 2 copies to give away."
1,Interperting the Bible Correctly,"Richard Fugate manipulates the word of God so deftly in this book. He takes Holy, Blessed words and uses them to validate his abuse of his children. If one truely cares for his child and what the Bible says about their children they would do better to burn Fugate's book for light so they can read the Bible for themselves and see what the true word of God is. His flagrant manipulation of the Bible is a shame and it is a further shame if people follow his book and abuse their children."
1,Child abuse at it's best,This book is such harmful distortion of the message of Love that Christ wishes for us to show others (including children!)
1,save your money and your family at the same time,"Any family raised by this authoritarian patriarchal abusive paradigm will produce angry adults who are either passive-aggressive or openly defiant, but ultimately refusing to honor their abusive parents at all.If you want strained, fake ""relationships"" with your adult children, or no relationship at all, then this is the book for you. However if you want to bring your children up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, look elsewhere for advice. There is no nurture in this book, and the author replaces admonition with punishment. You will not find true godly counsel here."
5,A must read for every real christian parent,"This book is very important for parents to understand the proper training and bringing up of children. It will help those parents that are sick and tired of the ""Worlds"" way do raising children. It will help new christian parents to change their parenting style to be more godly. It will help ""old"" christians to realize how much of the world has crept into their homes. This is a must read for anyone who has a ""strong-willed"" child, a child labled as ADD, ADHD, and other sicknesses.Win back the hearts of your children today - don't let the devil have them - read this book and change your ways."
1,In Memory Of Jayden Kaylee McMullin,"Continuing to offer this item for sale allows for the distribution of information that contributes to an attitude that hitting is not child abuse, that hitting another human being regardless of age is acceptable ""discipline"", that children are guilty of the ""crime"" of childhood and must pay with their health and lives for adult immaturity and frustrations. Hitting an adult is common assault; hitting a pet is abuse of an animal; hitting a child according to this garbage becomes ""justifiable assault"". Consider the torture and murders of Sean Paddock, age 4, Talia Williams, age 5, Rebecca Bluff, age 3 and Jon Benet Ramsay (a murder invalidated by manipulation of police and the media). Please remove this obscene item and help to reduce the crime of child abuse rather than promote it. Any profits made from the sale of this abusive information feeds off the bodies of children who are beaten and murdered!"
1,No way!,"This book is not about true Christian parenting. It is about force, conditioning, and programming with pain and fear. It's filled with harmful advice and is inconsistent in what it professes. Stay far away from this book and buy something written by Alice Miller instead. I would give this book 0 stars if it were possible."
1,Disgusting,"as a pagan I am often accused of ritual abuse, child abuse etc by ""commited Christians"" such as this author. This book should be banned and every copy destroyed. there is no need for beating a child in this day and age, whether in the name of God, Jesus, Allah, Shiva or Isis. Appalling and disgusting. Please amazon...STOP SELLING THIS BOOK."
1,CHILD ABUSE,"This has got to be the worst book I've ever read. The author's main thesis is you have to totally control children and beat them into submission. On p.173-174 the author claims some children ""require enough strokes to receive stripes or even welts"". On p.177 he recommends whipping babies starting when they can crawl, with a ""balloon stick, willow or peach tree branch, blackboard pointer, or 1/8"" dowel rod.""Say what???No decent person thinks this is Christian behavior! Beating up babies with sticks, until they're injured??? I have a far better idea of God and Jesus than the sadist who wrote this child abuse manual. And I won't have to worry about being arrested for how I treat my child either!Try ""Christlike Parenting"", ""Biblical Parenting"", or ""Jesus on Parenting"" for legal, Christlike ideas on raising children."
1,UnChristian Wickedness,"I don't know which is more digusting, that someone would advise treating children so cruelly in the first place or that they would smear Jesus Christ and Christianity by doing it in Christ's name. Not only is the sadistic advice in this book alien to the teachings of Jesus, it is also alien to everything that modern science tells us produces happy, healthy, obedient children. Read the Bible (all of it, people!), read modern science, but avoid this vicious quackery like the plague! Shame on Amazon for selling a book like this and shame on them for removing reviews that are critical of it."
1,SHOCKED!,I am completely shocked and horrified that what this author says to do to children is legal in the United States.
1,A Fitting Sacrifice,"This book is Foolish, Self-Centered and Sinful. It rebels at all Reason. Therefore thou shalt take it and beat it with a Dowel Rod, yea, until it has stripes on every page. And thou shalt hurl it into the Flames of the Fireplace. And all future generations shall call thee Blessed.AMEN."
1,Not Christian or biblical,"This book advocates beating children into submission. It claims to be based solely on the Bible, but Fugate takes verses out of context. The rod verses were never meant to be taken literally. When you look into the Hebrew meanings of the rod verses of Proverbs, it's clear that they mean to discipline children, but not spank them. Read Matthew 18:1-15. It is clear Jesus does not want us to hurt them and actually gives severe warning to people who hurt children ""Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ""[Comment: The consequences for these believers are graphically described in 2 Peter 2:18-22.Check out [...] for more info on the true meanings of the rod verses. Children deserve God's grace! After all, Jesus suffered and died for all our sins, including children! So why make children suffer when Jesus already did!"
1,Child abuse is against the law in most civilized countries,I cannot understand why it is still possible to sell books like this in the US. In most civilized countries child abuse is against the law. I wonder why the government and the CPS are not doing anything against this horrifying child abuse.Its really stupid that these writes make it look like a biblical thing. I am happy I know better. Jesus loves the children and doesn't want them abused.
1,This book is a toxic misuse of scripture and it is dangerous.,"I would have given 0 stars but that isn't an option.I read portions of this book online and it is nothing more than a manual for child abuse disguised as 'Godly' advise. As a Christian mother I'm sickened that anyone would advocate for such disrespectful and abusive discipline of a child.Beating a child into submission does not bring about obedience. It merely creates a wounded, scared individual who submits to authority out of fear.I can't believe someone would publish or endorse this book. It is cruel and has NOTHING to do with scripture or the heart of God."
1,How To Raise An Anti-Social Child,"Authoritarian parenting practices, such as those being promoted in this book, are responsible for producing angry, alienated, emotionally stunted, anti-social children.Another outcome involves those children who are successfully broken of will and spirit, with Depression and self-destructive behavior serving as common manifestations.James C. Talbot"
1,THE MOST DISGUSTING BOOK EVER !!!,"This is the most disgusting book I have ever read. By doing what they are telling you to do in it, you are not ""disciplining"" your kids or ""putting them on the right track"". You are killing their very spirit, making them some robots following the parents' will when this will is not at all in the best interest of the child. Jesus will send those parents to Hell as he is the best example to use love and not violence to teach someone something - he never laid a hand or a rod on anyone and he even saved the prostitute from being stoned. So next time a parent wants to beat a child for their ""sins"", they should remember that they are sinners, too and to apply the rod on themselves first. Good parents, good children...."
1,false statements,"This book encourages families and individuals to do just the opposite of the way Jesus lived and what he said and did. Jesus never hit a child, and he never gave anyone permission to hit a child. Jesus told the children to come to him and told the apostles never to hinder them with fear, rejection or any other kind of abuse and neglect. Abusers hide behind the good name and good reputation of Jesus. It's a sad shame and horrible commentary that children suffer at the hands of antichrist abusers. An antichrist is a person or group of people who live, do and say just the opposite of Jesus Christ. Children have the right to be free from abuse in all it's forms."
5,Very Helpful & Most Important: BIBLICAL!,"This book is a great resource for parents. It gives plain, simple advice straight from the Bible. I would recommend this book to any parent or anyone thinking of being a parent. After reading this book and following it, I would follow it up with reading Tedd Trippe's ""Shepherding A Child's Heart"".This book does not replace the Bible but puts all the Bible says about child rearing in one concise place. Excellent book! Keep it on the shelf forever!A Mother from Georgia/S.Carolina"
1,Another Shameful Baby-whipping book,"This book advocates baby-whipping. Whipping an adult is the crime of assault and battery; whipping a baby is child-abuse. What would Jesus do? ""Let the little children come to me."" Whipping babies is not love. It teaches children that being a big person gives one the right to abuse smaller people. The evidence is clear, abuse begets abuse and leads to more mental illness and emotional dysfunction.It's time to stop."
5,A must read for good parenting,"What the Bible Says About Child Training (2nd Edition)I purchased this book for a couple expecting their first baby. For parents who want to raise their children with sound Biblical principles, this is a must read. The author has research the pertinent Bible passages from the original languages to get the exact meaning for the believer to understand. I read this book when my children had already reached their teens. I truly regret that I didn't have it to use when I started out as a parent."
1,This book recommends child abuse,"This book condones -- nay recommends -- beating your child. The thought of hitting my child turns my stomach -- and I hope it turns your stomach, too. There is no excuse for hurting someone more vunerable than yourself.PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE THIS BOOK OR FOLLOW ITS ADVICE!"
1,A child abuser's handbook.,"The author recommends whipping infants from under 6 months to all the way up to 20 years old with wooden dowel rods. For your own safety, the latter stands against reason, and the former stands against concern for your baby.Plus, beating a deaf boy sounds pretty cruel to me. Although, I guess the author might argue that he won't be able to hear himself scream.But chapter 17 is the most repugnant to anyone who loves children. In it, Fugate's central portrayal of children is that they are ""sinful, dirty and selfish.""I give this book a ""0 times 4"" stars for parents, but 5 stars for criminal psychologists, so it averages out to a 1."
1,Don't Buy It!!!,"I was recommended the book and regret I ever bought it, and especially regret ever reading it. The author sounds convincing, but even Satan can quote scripture. Please don't buy it, don't buy the book or the ideas in it, they are greatly in error."
5,This book is the answer to my prayers!,This book is incredible. Our whole family is going through a change and I have God to think for giving J. Richard Fugate the wisdom and understanding to write this book. I recieved this book as a gift from our church after the dedication of our 3rd child and I will be forever thankful
1,NO STARS: I cannot believe Amazon sells this book,"This book is nothing more than a child abuse manual. There is nothing ""Christ-like"" about beating a child. Barnes and Noble has stopped selling this book, and I hope Amazon will do the same."
1,Here we go again!,"One of the favorite sports for folks of the Christian Right is hitting kids. It makes them feel important, powerful, authoritative, and in control. They take a secular position (physical punishment is good) and then thumb through the Bible for passages that seem to support their position. J. Richard Fugate is yet another practitioner of this kind of child abuse wrapped up in biblical launguage. Of course, one could choose the same method to posit biblical support for adultery, incest, polygamy, slavery, the rigid suppression of women, and infanticide. The truth is that Mr. Fugate's counsel has nothing to do with Jesus of Nazareth who would be lothe to hit children. [...]"
1,Love and Respect is what children need!,"Fear will only make children fear you and other adults. This book is wrong and I would not recommend any parent new or experienced to listen to this authors advice. Making a child submit will make them weak and emotionally unstable. A child disciplined with love and respect or a toddler redirected to an activity they are allowed to do will be a happy child and know that they are always in a safe place where their parents love them and respect them for the individuals they are. Not trying to make them submit to the child they want them to be. No infant should be spanked for crying that is their only way to communicate hunger, discomfort and tiredness! That is absurd!"
1,Another horrible child beater's book!,"I give this book 5 millstones! Mark 9:42 ""And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea."" These are the words of Jesus! If you are a Christian and don't believe Jesus' word then you are a hypocrite. Quotes from the Bible that are used to support child beating are from the Old Testament. Jesus was against it. You should be too if you are a TRUE Christian!"
1,Don't waste your money,This book is pure abuse. This book will encourage you as parents to abuse your children if they disobey. Please don't buy it and waste your money. There are other books out there that are worthy of your hard earned money.
1,Shocked beyond Belief!!!,"I just have no words for this! I couldn't read the whole book because it was pissing me off. No I'm not Christian, but as a child I was raised in a Christian home. I gotta say what this author is talking about is abuse! On one page he even says ""chastize in private for the parent's safety. I ask why do the parents need to be safe if it's not abuse? Any parent who uses this method should be ashamed and should be turned in for abuse!! I have a 7 yr old who will be 8 soon. I don't spank her at all. I talk to her and give her time out. Guess what, she listens, she behaves, she loves, and she is very happy!! I don't need a rod to discipline my child. I don't need to beat my daughter into submission!!! That's crazy!!! I love my daughter and she loves me and she is a well behaved child!! For all of you who love this book....be ashamed!! Especially if you have to hide! Be very ASHAMED!!! For you are abusing your child!!!!"
1,Use of corporal punishment,"A minimum of a quarter of a million children are victims of physical abuse yearly in the US. A recent study showed that the actual rate may be 40 times higher than the official rate. Many children, even babies, die from physical abuse. To tell parents, as Fugate does, that parents, in punishing children in such a way, are ""carrying out God's judgment"" (p.223) is to encourage a dangerous practice and cloak it in religion. Fugate says that beating a child with a rod is the ""maximum expression of true love"" (p. 21). This sends a confusing message of ""love"" and hurt. I fear this book may do much harm to good intentioned parents and vulnerable children."
1,The Worst Baby Whipping Book Out There!,"""What the Bible Says...About Child Training"" by Richard Fugate is the worst baby-whipping book I've read. Fugate recommends whipping infants 6 months old and younger, and beating children up to 20 years old with wooden dowel rods. He doesn't spare disabled children either, describing beating a deaf boy and one with cerebral palsy. He also writes that ""parents should not be overly concerned"" if the beatings cause welts and bruises (p.174)!!Chapter 17, which goes into frightening detail about how to beat infants and children, is disgusting! This chapter pretty much sums up the nature of the book, beat a child from age 0 to 20 with ""rods"", for any ""act of rebellion"". They are ""sinful, dirty and selfish"", and the parents have the right to demand instant obedience and total control, whether the parents' requests are right or wrong!!How sad that educated ""Christians"" in our society actually believe this trash!"
5,Great for Kids and Adults alike,This book catches the attention of young and old. It is an entertaining read for the parents and my kids can repeat lines from it after only a couple of readings. It is an enjoyable story that catches their attention and begs for additional readings. (...)
5,A Beautifully Illustrated & Wonderfully Written Book,This is one of the most beautifully illustrated and wonderfully written books I've ever seen. It's a lovely story for children (& adults) and the illustrations really bring the book to life. I received my first copy as a gift and have purchased several as gifts for friends and family. It is a childrens book but atleast 10 of my adult friends have their own copy.
4,"Fun story, some rhymes are stretching it",My children received this as a gift from their Grammy. The story is fun as other reviewers mention-almost all kids love baths and can relate to this moose. Some of the illustrations have received hearty laughs from my four year old.The illustrations are great and my only complaint is a minor one in that a couple of the rhymes are really stretching it. This is the only thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars.It is a creative story that is a perfect lead-in to bath time.
5,Wonderful Easy to Read Bible,This is the same version Bible I read 30 years ago and became a Christian after reading it. It is easy to understand and flows easily while reading it. Would recommend this Bible especially for children or teens or for someone new to the Word.
2,Not my dream machine,"I went through two of these, both where returned and I bought a new Sanyo. I was disappointed in that the ad says it has a gold filter, the fact is, it does not. Both machines where discolored white. It was easy to see what was original and what was replaced. When the machine is in operation the coffee grinder compartment fills with steam from the coffee pot and remains wet. This is a mess to clean up. I had high hopes and loved the idea of what this machine offers. However, I was disappointed."
4,Decent value,"This costume was true to size and included the jumpsuit, shin guards and mask. The headpiece is a mask and not a helmet. The elastics were not securely connected on the shin guards, so we ended up having to pin them on. But my son was thrilled with his authentic looking motocross racer costume!"
1,Motocross Rider costume,Very disappointed in the quality for the price. Cheaply made. Face mask and shin guards made out of brittle plastic.
5,the Movie is a Classic hit..!! A Juicy Note!!!It'ss All good!! A Must have for any one who likes 70's black movies.,"""Grave Digger Jones & "" Coffin"" Ed Are At Their Best. Iwould Like to Find "" Come Back Charleston Blue"
1,too long for standard roller cover,Very odd. Standard roller cover does not fit on the frame. The frame is about 1/4 inch longer than standard roller cover. Paint drips everywhere.
1,Beware -Shepherd Pets is selling#08609 and claiming it is the #6620.,"Be careful when ordering. Shepherd Pets is selling a different item and has changed the picture. You can tell by the picture with the Shepherd Pets on top of it. This is not the 6620 with the curved handle. Be sure to confirm prior to ordering. The 08609 has a plastic release lever attached that will pick up and drip excess paint during jobs. I would not recommend that model. Beware of seller Shepherd Pets, the item that he is selling is not the 6620."
1,Piece of junk! Buy the S-Video cable from Nintendo instead,"Picked up this cable from Toys R Us last week and was totally disappointed. I have a 42 inch LCD HD flat panel TV but this cable will give you the screen door effect so games actually looked much worse than the composite video cable that came with the gamecube system. I returned it immediately and ordered the s-video cable from Nintendo store online the next day. Now, I can tell you that I am a happy man! The s-video cable from Nintendo makes graphics sharper and colors more vivid than the standard composite cable. The cost of Nintendo s-video cable is about ten dollars more than Intec, but the difference in the clarity of image is night and day. Btw, I don't recommand getting the Monster cable brand either, because they are way over priced, why pay more if you can get the same quality cable directly from Nintendo and cheaper."
5,"If you have S-Video input on your TV, you need this","In short, this item is critical to get the most out of your GameCube or N64 if your Television has an S-Video input. While it is true that some people may not care about the difference in video quality that a S-Video connection can deliver, those same people most likely don't play video games. The Nintendo GameCube potentially delivers stunning graphics, and if you invest in that machine, you owe it to yourself not to let your display limit the potential for your enjoyment of those graphics. Of course, if you have digital input, that is better still, but for those of us with only analog input, S-Video leads the way."
1,"This cable is a non-alcoholic beer, and I ordered whiskey.","This cable produces exactly the same graphics quality onscreen as the standard Nintendo AV cable. I have a Sony Wega Trinitron KV-36HS520 42"" TV (AWESOME), and I got up close and personal with the screen (playing RE4) for about 10 min after hooking up the Intec cable, and I could not see any difference at all from the factory cable. This model TV actually improves graphics quality on its own with Progressive Scan DRC, but I know upgrading from the standard AV connection that the image can look better with either an S-VIDEO cable or a component cable. Seeing as how the component cable is now selling for $50-$80, I can't justify sinking that kind of cash into my Gamecube at this point. I'm going to go for the Monster S-Video cable for $15. It's at least gold plated and comes from Monster, which is renowned for quality. But still, this Intec S-Video cable is not even worth the $7 I spent on it. I want my 10 minutes back."
4,It was what was needed,The product is fine. The only suggestion I would make might be the option of removing ( jacks/plugs) that you don't need for your system. But since its cheaper to manufacture this way its understood. Cables work great.
1,S-Video Cable for Gamecube - No need for this,"Everyone told me that S-Video was the way to go. I know it makes your TV picture better (i have seen proof of that), but when i got my game cube i didn't think there was any way it could look any better. I was right. I got the cable because i heard so many great things about S-Video and figured i'd give it a shot. I hooked it up and see no difference at all. I do not see any need for this item and would not bother with it. The cable you get with the cube does the same job."
4,It's a great Album,"Christina Aguilara's album is really good. I got it for Christmas,and haven'y listened to anything since. My favorite song on it is track three,and the one I hate the most is Come On Over. It's a dippy song.I would definatly reccomend this cd"
5,The best dance song ever!,"Christina Aguilera proves herself to be the best teen artist time and time again. Her lastest song is no exception. Her vocal talent and dance moves far surpass those of her competition (a.k.a Britney Spears). Like it or not, this single will be number one next week and is here to stay."
2,Non helpful,"This book did not address modern day issues, nor got to ""the point"" when referencing the Bible. The information was not helpful in determining what was needed to make sexual decisions in a modern day relationship.(note that relationship is not with my sister, sister in law, brother, brother in law, or any related person)"
5,Searching for a new copy at a better price?,"I found this title at nupathways dot com. Just a hint. Published in 2000, it is as relevant and ground-breaking today as it was then."
3,Lousy packing,"I ordered a box of Bostitch 1-9/16 inch brads along with a box of Bostitch 2 inch brads. They arrived promptly but the box of 1-9/16 inch brads burst open in shipment and the brad rails were busted into small segments. The 1-9/16 inch brads were boxed in a cardboard container while the 2 inch brads, which survived intact, were in a molded plastic container.Either Bostitch and/or Amazon need to learn how to ship these items without having them being damaged en route."
5,Fantastic music,"Another great album from the talented AR Rahman. His depth, knowledge and understanding of different genres of music is very impressive."
5,A relaxing and enjoyable treasury for especially for lighthouse lovers,"The Beacons of South Carolina presents the true stories of twelve of South Carolina's historic light houses. Black- and-white photography on almost every page illustrates these brief yet fascinating overviews of the construction and operation of each tower. Carefully researched with a bibliography, a list of sources including an impressive collection of websites, and an index, The Beacons of South Carolina is a relaxing and enjoyable treasury for especially for lighthouse lovers."
2,It could have been much better!,"Some songs in this CD do not belong there because they are not Cumbias. ""Pachuco Bailarin"" (which is a good song) can't be compared with Sonora Tropicanas ""Cumbia del Muerto"" Its like comparing a lemon to an egg, they dont belong in the same catagory. And the version of ""Cumbia Del Garrote"" by Banda Los Lagos is the worse I ever heard. If variety is your preference than get it...otherwise keep it away from your radios!"
3,"Captivating ""Unveiling the Mysterof a Woman's Soul",I have found this book to be both informative and a means of taking me back to painful experiences in my own life. The writers then reminded the readers of God's perspective and perfect plan.
4,Timely Book for High School and College Ages,Eldredge's book was very thoughtful for my college-aged daughter . . .and somewhat interesting to an over 40 mom.
2,Messed Up Doctrine,"Although I believe this book helps enlighten one to the reality that our soul and deepest longings as women are interconnected with the Creator and His passionate love for us...MUCH of it's ""theology"" is flawed. I felt an appeal to self exaltation and a humanizing of God that is clearly anti-biblical. I would guide any of my fellow Christian readers to remember that all false doctrine is effective because it is dressed up in truth....but it's heart message is false and usually self exhorting."
4,Eye opening and interesting.,"This is the first Christian book I've ever read and I'm going through it with a small group. It's eye opening for me and while I have a long way to go in understanding all of this, I am enjoying this new learning adventure."
5,A journey into finding God Captivating,"This book is so good. I went into it thinking it would be all about how I am captivating and it is but, along with that I am finding God captivating. I want to know more, I am seeking Him more and I can't wait to learn more about who he is in me and who I am created to be. If you are looking for a deeper relationship with Your Heavenly Father, then this is the book for you Ladies!"
4,A nice little tank for the price,I disagree with the prior review. I think the LANARD Corp tank is pretty nice overrall. I do have both Corps Figures as well as their more famous US cousins and found it no problem to get them into or out of the tank unless you let them fall inside of the tank. since there are no seats inthe body hatches the figures can stand there but not be placed inside the tank body the turret holds 2 figure and 2 in the body of the vehicle
5,Fun!,"I borrowed this book from a friends. I coundn't believe how funny it is. As a Trekkie, its very hard for me to find militarish books that I like. This one beat them all. The only other book I have found that could possibly be compared was the Trek book, How Much For Just The Planet. Phule's Company was better! A great book and I hope to read the rest! ."
3,Hmmm,"Maybe it's just me, but whoever thought up the blurb for this one misstated the 'invasion'. I did like this book but I did not like the 'teaser'.Some very interesting points about human nature were presented. A good read if you have a lot of time on your hands."
2,Asprin isn't bad enough,"You can find out what Phule's Company is about on the back of the book. The only problem is, you'd be wrong. The plot summary suggests one thing: a ragtag, incompetent, and recklessly dangerous band of military misfits pull together to somehow save the human race. What's inside the book is quite different. Far from being the scum of the galaxy, the characters are nice and polite to excess. Far from being a wild action-adventure, the plot involves mostly drills and chit chat.I think what went wrong is this. Robert Asprin is too serious to be funny and too nice to be nasty. ""Phule's Company"" is not really funny. The jokes are few and they fall flat every time. There's not a single real laugh in here. Asprin likes Phule and his crew too much to really mock them. As for plot, there's no there there. We can't really cheer for the characters because they have so little to overcome. The criminals, cut-throats, and losers would be the goody-goodies in any other novel."
3,SciFi Humor...,"Kinda. I hate scifi for the most part (it's not everyone's cup of tea) and I needed something to read badly (I really need to start going to a library or something) and so a friend gave me the Phule books.Phule's Company is funny and it's humorous, but it's not great. It is an enjoyable read but for me it wasn't a fast read. It got my imagination somewhat and the writing style was good. My attention span, however, was left to wander so I would put it down, read something else, do something else, and then start wondering what happened, read some more, put it down, etc.It's not a page turner, it is light reading, the story is interesting, and the characters are fun. Yet I can't sit still and try to read it all at once because I find myself getting bored.Maybe if you're more into the SciFi genre, you'll have a better response. But as far as humor goes, it's decent.So three stars is my personal opinion."
2,"Just okay, lower quality than expected. Returned item","Item came with some broken parts (LED mainly) and didn't seem all that durable. A new one was shipped at no cost and we tried it for a few days with a very enterprising 11 year old. Some of the info was over his head but much of the project items were not compelling enough to keep the unit.If this is your child's first exposure then it's probably fine, just don't expect a durable unit. For more entry-level, try snap kits. For more advanced, try Paralax and a bread board"
5,Perfect for year-round use,"Our daughter was born at the beginning of April, while it was still fairly cold out. We used the Bundle Me Lite from the day we took her home, and we still use it on her carseat now, nearly four monts later. During winter, we simply tucked an additional blanket over our daughter; in the height of summer, we rolled the cover under our daughter's feet. Having it on the carseat all year means we're never without some sort of cover for our girl - especially when going from outdoor summer heat to indoor air conditioning. I've had no problems with shrinkage or falling apart in the wash. Overall, this is one of the most versatile and useful products we own, and I highly recommend it."
3,works well until washing then zippers fall apart,I loved this until I had to wash it for the first time. I followed the washing directions to the letter and when putting the Bundle Me back onto the car seat the zippers fell apart. My daughter loved being zipped up so much that I went to the dry cleaner/tailor and had a new zipper put in.
4,Much more than a thriller.,"The Collector is the first novel I've read by Fowles and I liked it so much that now I'm reading ""The Magus"". This author, although very popular, has been a real discovery for me.The Collector is at the same time a sort of thriller, a novel about ideas and a very cruel story. And the story is told from the perspective of only two characters: Clegg and Miranda. It is written in a form that not only those two characters are credible but also other ones that we know about only through Miranda or Clegg's words.I think I will remeber this novel for a long time."
4,Fascinating perspectives on life and death,"I almost put this book down around half way, found it very disturbing, but reading on was fascinated by the comments and thoughts on art. The juxtoposition of images of life and death both literal and figurative was fascinating and very thought provoking."
2,Mr Fowles expects us to swallow this!? C'mon!,"I found the basic premise of this story totally unrealistic. Where I come from, Miranda would have let Frederick have it where it hurts most the first chance she had (he's obviously such a wimp), then legged it. The book could have been over in thirty-odd pages!"
1,An old book,"This was a boring book. I got it because it was mentioned in another book I was reading. I was going to give it as a gift, but ditched that idea."
4,a very different type of writing,"Although writing styles are different, this book reminded me of Lolita by Nabakov. Maybe because of the intimate portrait of one's psychology that is written without the tone of conventional moral judgment. I can't say whether I liked this book because it was a very cerebral reading experience leaving me with feelings of rather eerie detachment, but definitely got me interested in reading his other books."
4,Unforgettable,"I read this book 30 years ago, and it still haunts me. I don't know whether to recommend it because it's such an engrossing read, or to tell you to stay away from it because it scared me so deeply and so permanently."
3,Creepy and Inspiring,"The book is divided into two distinct halves: one from the kidnappers prospective the other from his victim.The first half of the book is full of self-pity and rationalization of horrific acts, think late 1960's emo's. The abductor has a profound belief that given the proper chance that his victim will truly love him and make him whole. While on the surface it's exploitive nature would seem repulsive the writer makes your understand that this man is a victim was well, but that in no way justifies his behavior.The second and more revealing is a celebration of the strength of human will. The victim barely acknowledges her kidnapper and instead tries to focus on the good things in life and make that the focus and not the current situation.The book is obviously controversial but it is well written and has many interesting themes running throughout."
3,"Excellent book, but not as good as The Magus","I agree with my fellow reviewers that this book is definitely worth reading, even if it is at times 'unbearable' to read.Nevertheless, I found the book to have weak, or should I say, slower moments. Where Fowles keeps the tension and movement high in The Magus, The Collector is told from different perspectives/narrators. Since the narrators tell their perspective on the same event sequentially and not in parallel, some sections are strangely repetitive and did not lead me to compare the perspectives of the kidnapped girl and the kidnapper. All together though I can only add my recommendation for this great book."
5,A decade of admiration,"I was handed The Collector when I was thirteen years old. My mother said, I think you'll like this book. Today, I have adapted it into a stage version, which will be produced in Chicago early 1998. The Collector is a perfect look into the mind of a mild mannered psychotic and a strong but understandably frightened victim. The book forces us to have sympathy for both characters, to see their side of this amazing story. Ferdinand is the scariest of all sexual predators because of his quiet obsession that has the potential to burst into violence and insanity at any moment, yet there are more than a few times in the book when the reader finds his or herself pulling for him. I think Miranda's response to him sums up the book perfectly, ""What have I done to frighten you?"" ""Nothing, that's what I'm afraid of."""
5,Good read,"The Collector, by John Fowles, illustrates a man obsessed with a woman to the point of insanity. Ferdinand, the antagonist of the novel, is a misfit of society. Growing-up as a loner, he develops a passion for collecting butterflies. He feels the need to possess the beautiful creatures with no concern for their freedom and beauty displayed in nature. After secretly observing Miranda, the protagonist of the novel becomes crazed with desire to trap her and add her to his collection. Miranda's beauty and grace as well as her life are destroyed during Ferdinand's possession of her.Love is an underlying destructive force in The Collector. Both characters believe that Ferdinand's ""love"" for Miranda is what is keeping her prisoner but only Miranda knows it will destroy both of them. Miranda by death and Ferdinand by insanity."
1,The Collector,"I would not recomend this book. I saw the movie many years ago and always felt there was something missing in the movie that I did not get. I wanted to read the book to see if I could get a better understanding of the story. I did not like it any better. Other than the fact that he was an odd ball with a depraved mind, who did not know what to do with a female. The book wasn't worth the words it took to write it. I do wonder about the author too. Who comes up with a story like this???? My thoughts went as far as wondering if a character like this would do it again."
5,Reading it slowly,"The Collector is extremely well written. Oh, it's easy to read I could polish it off quicky, but what for? It's eerie. Delicious. Suspenseful. Why hurry?So natural,the narrative - we are in our hosts mind. As the protagonist's ponders the action you may trust just enough, as if you are settled in for the night with an old friend. Then, you start to think about it- in horror ( we hope you don't know ...)but continue on anyway.Classic author John Fowles offers a fine read."
5,A broken Butterfly's wing.,Mr Fowles has such a gift for getting the reader into the head of the subject. I really enjoyed this book. The way the book is crafted from the prospective of the two subjects was inventive and enlightening. I thought it was well balanced regarding the male female relationship and their reactions to the progress of the book. I would recomend this book to anyone looking to really exscape for the duration of the book.
4,good psychological thriller,"This book is divided into the abductor's point of view and the abductees. I was very drawn into it for the abductor as he described the difficulty of keeping his prisoner. Once I read about the girl and her thoughts, I hoped he would kill her. I won't spoil it for you. She needed to die though."
3,A Chilling Tale,"This is truely an interesting story, and quite disturbing as well. It is about a young man named Ferdinand, a butterfly collector, who ""collects"" a young named Miranda, the object of his obession. Ferdinand keeps Miranda in a room in the basement of a house that he bought for that purpose. In the interest of briefity, Ferdinand keeps Miranda in the basement until she ultimately dies of illness. The two have a twisted and psychologically engaging relationship, which often switches from pure hatred, to pity, and even companionship. The book is claimed to be the inspiration behind a number of serial killers. It lives up to the hype and is worth the short time it takes to read."
2,There must be something I don't understand...,"I just finished reading this book as part of my school summer reading. It's not that I don't read, on the contrary, I read between 2 and 3 books a week, usually fantasy or sci-fi. I didn't like this book. To me, it was monotonous and dull. Upon looking at the other comments, I don't understand what people see in this book. Obviously it is character-based, which I'm not used to, but I think there's something more than that. I think that I may have missed the essence of this book. I thought that this book was dull and repetitive, and the only good part was the last 2 pages, where he considers doing it again. Well, that's my opinion, anyway."
2,The Frustration,"This book is definitely intriguing, so if that is your goal when buying a new book, then you'll love this book. Its completely unique and original in plot and in character. I love the way that it gets into the minds of the main characters.I, personally, had a really hard time reading/liking this book. Miranda reminded me too much of myself, and my frustration about being ""trapped"" in this book only grew as I read it. I became so utterly frustrated that it was difficult to read this book at all for me. I suppose in that sense, the writer, Fowles, is ingenious in that I experienced his written emotion so palpably.And for any plot readers, this is not a book for you. While the beginning offers promise in the plot department, you will be disappointed with the end."
2,So much hype and deeply overrated,"I had been wanting to read this book for a long time now, and I finally managed to get through it. I found it to be poorly written, long in parts, and just not that captivating at all. And it even inspired the numerous murders by a notorious serial killer who regarded this book as his Bible. You would think that upon knowing this it would make for...at least...interesting reading...but no. YAWN."
2,Too long...,"The concept of the book is quite interesting (although far from being new), but the content is repetitive not very interesting to read: after the first 100 pages you understand more or less what will happen next, and what really happens next would fit 50 pages while is presented on 200. Well, maybe the length and the style of the book is a part of the depressive impression the author wanted to leave, but I think he's gone too far."
5,If you like Dave Matthews Band you will LOVE Left Hand Smoke,These guys are the greatest! I can't tell you enough. I saw them at a concert in Seattle and they are absolutely incredible. I think they will make it huge for sure. I met a couple of these guys after their show and they were so nice. I have both of their cd's and they are totally awesome! I hope they continue to play music for a long long time. I think if you like Dave Matthews Band you will love Left Hand Smoke!
4,Quaketastic,"Obviously this wouldn't be much fun if 'Quake 2' had been a dog, but it wasn't, and short of getting it on budget, this is the best way to buy it. After the hugely popular but disappointing 'Quake', '2' was more of a proper sequel to the original 'Doom'. Introducing colours other than green and brown, and re-introducing the BFG, '2' was faster-paced and better-looking, and is still good fun, both single-player and over the internet. With the exception of some terrible explosions, the graphics haven't dated too badly. The Id-endorsed mission packs are a bonus - 'Ground Zero' is the best of the two, and it has a chainsaw too!"
2,is it just possible...,"that reviewer williams is related to the author of surviving galeras? could this explain the single star rating she awards this, the better book, and the five awarded the former? they are both crummy, this one slightly less so."
1,science or fiction?,"This book which purports to be a scientific study lacks the critical thinking about data and literature which is really vital to scientific inquiry.Many reviewers have praised this book in comparison to SURVIVING GALERAS but they are really books with very different purposes. While this book pretends to be science, SURVIVING GALERAS is a better book. It is a true life adventure with science and history to supplement the story.I was distressed by what I felt was the lack of critical thinking and the acceptance by the author of one theory over another without the kind of thoughtful critical thinking needed.It is still not known exactly or even inexactly how to predict eruptions. This is science for the simple minded.Someone will write a better book about the science of volacanoes one day. In the meantime for a good read and good science try SURVIVNG GALERAS."
1,Banal and Repetitious,"If you already have spiritual practice, this CD will likely offer nothing new. If you don't have a spiritual practice this CD probably won't inspire one. I had high hopes for this CD and have been working with the two energy centers she refers to for some time. This CD offered nothing new to my experience. The author's voice was potentially very soothing and powerful, but unfortunately the meditations were of little to no substance. Shes uses all the banal buzz words of new age jargon (over and over again) almost to the point of cliche."
1,missing information,The note cards are not the fold over kind that you would expect. They are only a single blank sheet of card stock. These cards are somewhat smaller than the envelopes. I was very disappointed with this order.
2,not what I wanted,"The colors was really nice, but the ad was deceiving to me. I thought it was a folded notecard that you could write inside of, but it was only a index size card. They would make a good postcard and that's all."
4,Good info and Pretty Pictures.,"If you are curious about burlesque and it's stars, you should give this book a try. The pictures are nice and the information is pretty good."
2,It evaporated,"I purchased this product to thin a few of my most frequently used nail polishes out. It worked well, and I was happy with the results.HOWEVER. I just grabbed my bottle to use it again, and the bottle was empty. I don't recall, but I believe the item is sold with a regular screwtop lid, and a screwtop dropper lid. Do NOT store this item with the dropper lid screwed on. It is not airtight. My nail polish thinner actually evaporated to the point of the bottle being completely dry and empty. I have had the thinner for under a year and I keep it in a relatively cool dark place, along with all my polishes. I am very disappointed as I used the product only once, and to be honest a little bit unsettled by the fact that it actually evaporated without a trace in such a short period of time. Very displeased."
1,Chairs,"I ordered these chairs and were delayed in receiving. When received, assembled and it was very wobbly and could not be fixed. The manufacturer does not deal with the public and could not contact the seller or Amazon by phone and Amazon did not respond to any of my e-mails. Challenged the charge on American Express. Do not buy from this company."
4,Love the Colors,"I don't know why the first reviewer had a bad experience with these discs. I have burned tons of CDs successfully with these. I love the color differences and the quality of the burns are great. I actually came on here to see if I could obtain more seeing how the stores don't seem to sell them anymore. But it looks like I am even out of luck here. If these are available by the time you get around to looking at this page, they are a really neat addition to your CD collection. I would recommend them."
1,I Hope They Paid Him Well...,"...They couldn't pay him enough.In a role that fits him about as well as a central casting loin cloth, Buster Crabbe cavorts among the trees as one of the worst Tarzans ever. To be fair Mr. Crabbe does what he can with a poorly conceived mishmash of a film. His co-star, Miss Wells, while probably considered sexy at the time, is no Jean Rogers and offers very little in the way of interest, romantic or otherwise. The finest moment that this movie offers is the sight of Buster Crabbe sitting astride a tree limb, giving new meaning to the phrase, ""spanking the monkey."""
1,"Don't Touch This Movie- ""FALSE ADVERTISING""","This is ""NOT"" the complete serial, it only runs 86 minutes, although it is listed as such running 200 minutes and a 12 part serial. This is ""NOT"" as listed.It is only 86 minutes and the ""WORST"" print I've ever seen. You have been warned in advance, don't get ripped off, stay away from this."
1,Bad Medicine Stay Away,I make no judgement but highly suggest that you do not attend these gatherings.Happy to provide more information upon request.
5,Empowering,"This book gives the reader an insite to the true way of the Cherokee. Very respectfully written in regards to the ""old ways"". A true empowering experience."
4,Good european blues band,This disc rocks and swings. My first purchase of their available cd's and is worthy of a buy recommendation. I plan on checking out they other work.
3,Worth it for track 10 alone!,"A mixed CD of pipes and brass that offers a good variety of tunes and styles. Performances are variable (some are downright amateur), as is sound quality. Having said that, there are a few cracking (pipe) tunes in there - check out the Banjo Breakdown / Butterfingers / Caber Feidh medley by the Edinburgh City Pipers.Overall, this CD is not bad if you ignore the brass!"
1,Where to begin?,"This could possibly be one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read. Ewan Lochlain returns to town years later to Cyd, the woman he's always had a thing for. Cyd remembers him fondly but treats him like absolute garbage. Alls I read throughout the book was Ewan was one of the only people (besides his father) who made her truly feel safe. I kept thinking - then why the animosity towards him? This animosity continued 3/4 through the book. Ewan just kept taking whatever Cyd dished out.I could go on and on about Cyd. I think I just read the whole way through to see what idiotic thing she would do next. She's a 30+ virgin and when she gives it up to Ewan, there is no feelings involved, she just needs to work off some energy? Huh? What virgin does this?I would write more, because truly there is, but I felt as if I've wasted enough time on this book."
5,Cait London does it again!,"Cait's books just keep getting better. Characters are outstanding and the book just flows from one scene to the next. She weaves her plot well, always coming back to the main theme in a manner that keeps you on the edge of your chair! The unexpected twist of Evan's father being alive just capped it off for me. I loved it!"
2,Not as great as one would have hoped.,"As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one. However, I had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed as to how much I didn't love it. If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it; maybe you will enjoy it more than I did. If you have yet to read Anne Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book. I suggest reading Celestial Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's mastery."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"I've read all of Anne Tyler's works, so I was excited to read this one. I also purchased it as my first e-book. But it was so slow and uneventful. I kept waiting for turn of events that never came. Even as I got to the end of the story, and because it was an e-book and you don't have physical pages to see how far along or how much story is left, I was somewhat shocked when the end came! So sadly, I was dissappointed in this book. There was of course a certain feel for the town, the dust, and the general sadness (a little depressing actually regardless of the story line) the unusual characters. But the story just left me wanting to hurry and find a little more uplifting and enjoyable read, afterward. I was a little bummed."
2,Not one of Anne Tyler's better books,"I am a big fan of Anne Tyler and have read most of her books and liked every one of them EXCEPT for ""The Tin Can Tree"". It was boring. Plain and simple."
5,Great value!,This is a great product and a great value. My daughter is very creative and has a lot of fun making many different things with these.
5,Powerful!,Magnificent! Powerful music that is anointed with royalty. Get a peek of the Heavenly New Jerusalem now and order this CD.
5,Dress-up Time,"Picked up this and the Belle dress (from the same manufacturer) this past Christmas for my (2) daughters. My initial impressions were favorable but I wanted to hold off on a review till it was abused for a while.The dress is thin and doesn't really flare out as you'd expect from a ball dress but it's easily stowed and packed. The material has a satin sheen and is comfortable when my kids wear it for extended periods of play. This is more than I can say for some Disney branded dresses that are itchy and hot.Both my kids love this dress, it's held up to their abuses, and have been thrown in the wash multiple times without ill affect. Worth the money; would purchase again."
2,Too expensive for its poor quality,"I just got this item in mail as my little girl is expecting this from Santa. Xmas is only a few days away and I cannot even imagine going to another store looking for an alternate. I really wished that I would like this item but as soon as I opened the box, I couldn't help but be stunned with a disappointment. It is poorly made with poor quality thin fabric. If my daughter runs around in this item, I won't be surprised to see it ripped. The first thing came to my mind was that it is probably worth only about $15 the max. I paid $29.99 at Amazon. Anyhow, I don't want to let my girl down so I guess we are keeping this for Xmas. I am so unhappy with the quality that I am secretly hoping that my girl would dislike it so that I can return it right after Xmas. I know that this sounds terrible but for those who are considering this item, hope this review helps. The sad thing is that I couldn't find any other better looking items in the similar price range."
2,Really poor quality,"I was expecting that this dress would be at least of the level of the gowns sold in Target, if not the Disney store. But the material is this very thin, cheap satin with no underlayers or extra skirting. I wanted to return it soon after I'd compared it to the ones at the Disney store but had already thrown away the external packaging (just a plastic bag, but still it was gone). And I couldn't bring myself to spend more money on top of it, so this is the junk my daughter wore last Halloween. Please, wait for a sale at the Disney Store and buy one there instead."
1,"Wow, Burce would have been really mad at this movie","I mean the trailers have his grave like blowing up. They show this at the start of the movie, and then the movie actually starts. The kung fu is decent at best and the story is not worth going over. It is your standard modern day boring kung fu story and left me wishing I hadn't wasted 90 minutes on this when I was finished with it."
1,DASHEIKS 2 CENTS: I forgot to mention...,"Don't buy anything from ""Platinum"" the company that sells this film. I also ordered ""Jackie Chan: The 36 Crazy Fists"" and Jackie Chan is nowhere to be found on this dvd. Platinum should be sued for using big star names to sell their products. I for one want my money back."
2,NOT BRUCE LEE MATERIAL!!!!,The kung fu fighting is OK but the voiceacting is awful and bruce lee is not even init. In the movie there is a look-alike brucelee. This DVD is worth renting but not buying...This DVDis not orginial and not that good anyway.
1,DASHEIKS 2 CENTS: Can I give this movie no stars?,"This is the worst kung-fu flick I have ever seen. The voice acting is so stupid, I just wanted to rip my face off. I hate this movie with a passion. Bruce Lee had exactly nothing to do with this movie. God rest his soul, the man probably turns in his grave every time someone mistakes this garbage for his work. Don't be fooled like I was when I ordered this. This movie is horrible and painful to watch from beginning to end. Movies i do recommend in place of this filth are the care bears movie I and II, anything with someone ... on the toilet, uhhh, last years office christmas party that you recorded, anything but this. PEACE ON EARTH."
2,Unimpressive,"The Order of battle for 1 Gebirgs Division and a bunch of good photos are not enough to make a good book. Most photos might be found elsewhere (like in excellent Kaltenegger's 'Photographic chronicle of the elite Gebirgsjager'). The title is somehow misleading - most of equipment and weapons are described in text only very briefly and not illustrated properly with photos or drawings, apart from maybe artillery pieces.As a starter to Gebirgsjager works only !"
2,Not What We Expected,"We got this for our daughters 5th birthday. She wanted it so bad, but what a shock when we opened it. One of the flowers broke as we were opening it. It only plays 2 songs and they are not the most listened to from Disney. You can't really follow along to play this because it's a little off. Maybe I'm being too critical, but I don't want anyone else to waste their money on it. My daughter has not picked it up since her birthday. I suggest you try one of the other princess instruments unless they too have bad reviews."
3,Nice gift,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She enjoys playing with it, especially taking the flower petals off of the blooming flowers. Disappointing that they come off so easy but otherwise good toy."
1,Save your money and time!,What a disappointing toy. Save your money and time don't buy this toy. I wish I had read the reviews first. Every single petal fell off the piano within one hour of opening the box. My child was so upset because she really wanted this piano. It is so poorly constructed and yes as previous reviewer stated the petals are small and definitely a choking hazard!
3,I thought the movie was o.k. but it could have been better.,The movie was alright. It didn't have much of a plot but it was quite funny. I liked it. Critters 3 wasn't at all that scary. I mean the category that the movie falls under is neither comedy or horror but both.
1,Leonardo DiCaprio is the ONLY good thing about this film!,"I finally bought this film after a lot of hesitation, and the only reason I bought it in the first place was that Leonardo DiCaprio is my favorite actor. I've heard a lot of BAD reviews for this film. Guess what, folks? It's all true, and then some! This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life! Leo was great in it, but then, he's great at everything he acts in...After all, it wasn't his fault the movie was so dumb! I guess everybody has to start somewhere, right?! END"
2,Leo's the best,"I think Leo is a brilliant actor, one of the world's best. I think he did very well in his first movie role. He was the only good actor in the movie. Although the movie was one of the worst I've ever seen, if Leo wasn't in it, I wouldn't have watched it in the first place. I LOVE YOU LEO!!!! END"
5,OK,"The third Critters movie, I would have to say is probably the best of the four.This is the story of the hairy little aliens that take over an aprtment building in search of humans,their favorite snack.Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent. END"
2,Now they want dessert,"Normally there's like some way of showing that there may be a sequel for another movie in most movies, and after Critters 2, there wasn't anything showing for a 3rd movie. I even thought that there wasn't a third Critters movie 'til I seen it on SyFy years ago and watched it. Then I wasn't sure what to think but now I think that it's good, the writing seems to be a little improved over the first two movies but it still has that cheesy feel to it and of course the Critters still have their sense of humor in this movie. The effects of all the movies so far have been good for their time and if they were done today I think that these movies would probably look better visually. Though there are some that may not know that with this movie was Leonardo DiCaprio's film debut and I think he done well for his first film, even if it was either a television movie or a straight to video release. Overall I give Critters 3, 2.5 stars out of 5."
3,"OK movie, but starts the downfall for the critter series.","Ok, first off let me just start off by saying there is a whole lot more to this movie than Leonardo DiCaprio, infact, I am ashamed to own this movie because he is in it, anyways this movie is pretty good if you like the critter series, its even a bit scary at times. The only reason why i don't like this movie is because it just doesn't follow the rest of them. but if you like the critter series go for this movie! it really isn't all that bad!"
2,The ok Critter movie!,"Critters 3 I thought wasnt as good as they said because they didnt do some real action.When I frist saw the movie it was the first critters movie I saw so I thought it was pretty good,but when I got 1,2,and 4 I didnt think it was that good of a Critters movie.Besides what happened when Charlie got the Cherif duty in the secound one and he's not the Cherif of Groversbend in the third?When Charlie gave that kid a crystal and it would glow if there was trouble and it didnt when there wasnt , that was like something that didnt even need to be in the movie.Afterall I guess it is an ok critters movie but some things I just think are just plain stupid."
2,A needed to complete the series movie.,Not a very good movie. I do suggest buying it only to complete your collection. Then watch it once only to understand what is going on.
3,Could have been better!,"I thought this was an ok sequel but not as good as the first 2 films. I think there should not have been any more sequels after 2 because it ended really well. This one could have been a little better and the same thing goes for part 4. The only good part of 3 is when they show Charlie, the rest of the movie is kind of boring. I own all 4 of these films on dvd and even recommend this one to add to your collection."
4,"PEOPLE, PEOPLE, THIS MOVIE JUST ISN'T ABOUT LEO! C'MON!","OK, folks, stick to the program here. I'm tired of reading reviews that doesn't even talk about the movie! Sure Leonardo was in it, but so what? Who gives a care? I know I don't. Critters 3 was an OK movie. Just not enough Critters in it. It's about these new critters that start to hatch and head for aN L.A. apartment building, where there they find ""fresh meat"". While Ammie and her brother stop at the gas station, they wonder off into the far field. But without watching the brother, he soon wonders off leaning over a short edge cliff, but a kid (Leo) stops him. As they all go off into the woods, a strange man erupts out of the ground, (Don Opper). And there, the critters hatch from under their van as soon as they arrive at the apartment buliding. Charlie McFaddin must help find the critters and help the family before the Krites get to them. Stellar movie, just not enough Critter action in it."
1,Boring...Don't Waste Your Time,Watched it on HBO and wasted my time watching this. Talk about boring.. Part 1 and 2 are way better than this one. All this is basically is a family stuck in an apartment through 90% of the movie while the critters try to get them. Very boring...
3,Critters 3,"""Critters"" is not so good but Leonardo made it count! He and Aimee Brooks are very good as Josh and Annie and they showed that they're strong and daredevils in that terrible situation, dealing very well with the critters."
2,Leo Was The Only Good Part Of This Movie,"I would have to say that this movie sucked.But Leo made it all dat, if he wasn't in it, you couldn't pay me to see this....well maybe so, but still it really stunck. If you are a Leo fan, see it because he looks so FINE in this movie! Corny effects,not scarey at all, but funny. The movie i give 2 stars for trying, the 5 to Leo."
5,HYSTERICAL - definitely in my top 10 comedies,"This is the wierdest, most satirical, most brilliant high school comedy ever penned, let alone produced. And yes, high school was a sad, awkward hell for me, so it's not because I can't relate. This is awkward funniness that had me squirming in my seat as much as gazing at the screen in jaw-dropped could-they-ratchet-that-up-any-further? amazement. but they do. again and again and again. And the ending, considering the evolution of the film, is absolutely perfect. I'll leave it at that.one more comment: the 70's soft rock... oh man. do i ever remember these days. if i only knew how innocent we were!oh... and i'm not an SNL fan. i've never even sat through an episode. Occasionally I catch a skit here and there, mostly by accident. Never really caught on for me. I like a lot of comedians who came through the halls of SNL, though."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I didn't find this movie particularly funny. But, this is the type of comedy that I don't really enjoy. If you enjoy silly movies (like ""Dumb and Dumber""), then you will enjoy this movie. If not, then steer clear of this movie."
5,Awesome!!,My dvd arrived soon after I placed the order. I am happy with their service and would buy from them again.
5,Made me a fan of Molly,This movie made me a fan of Molly Shannon. She's sparky and crazy. I dont think they could have gotten anyone else to play this part better. Will Ferrell didnt make this ovie like he makes many of his others. Shannon shined. But Ferrell's input was muchappreciated. And was it just me or did anyone else think his character was gay?
1,It stinks,"This is by far, the worst movie of the year. Not only was the acting bad, but the plot is horrible, and it's not funny! I maybe chuckled every half hour or so, but afterwards I felt like an idiot because it was so stupid! Please give SNL a hint and never, ever get this movie!"
1,I only wish there was a no star option...,"Horrible, boring and not the least bit funny. Will Ferrel looks too old to be in high school. Avoid this one."
4,Fairly entertaining,"It's rather funny to see Molly Shannon and Will Ferrell co-starring as highschool kids, but they make worthy effort, and overall this movie is pretty funny. It's especially lulzy to see Molly Shannon stick her hands in her pits and sniff them, and she does a great job with her musical numbers. Overall this is a satisfying SNL-inspired flick that should satisfy Molly Shannon fans."
3,nice,"nice item.arrived in the outlined time, at a great price.havent been able to find this item in australia on dvd, just video, so i am suitably impressed.thankyou for a great price, speedy post and quality item."
1,i wish there were negative stars,"Im the guy that clear through my 20's id rent atleast 5-6 new releases a week.. to say ive watched just about everything thats came out in the past 15-20 years would be a understatement. We all have our best and worst movie choices, ""superstar"" is my number one all time biggest looser.. its just awfull, there's no other way to describe this movie, awfull.. i cant think of anything good to say about it at all, A nite at the Roxbury was a masterpiece by comparison.. just awfull, awfull, awfull....."
2,high expectaions = dumb movie,i had great expectations for this. they went down the drain. the only believeable charector was harland williams.
3,"Cute, but Cheesy","This movie was cute, yet sickening at the same time. It reminds me of an ""attempted"" funny version of Never Been Kissed.The movie is about a geeky schoolgirl who has never ""hollywood"" kissed a boy. She decides that the only way to kiss a boy is to act like the actors/actresses in the movies.In the beginning, I thought the movie was hilarious. By the end of the movie, I was pretty disappointed. The type of humor in the movie does not change; there is a weak plot in the movie at best. I will say the kid with the birthmark actually caught me off guard though.This movie isn't a bad movie if you feel you must see it; however, there are a lot of better movies out there to rent or buy."
3,"Funny, but not for everyone...","Being the SNL fan that I am, I eagerly rushed to Blockbuster as soon as ""Superstar"" appeared on the shelves. I rented the film to watch at my little sister's 8th birthday party, thinking that I, along with my sister and her friends, would love it. Well, I was partly right. My sister and her pals found the entire movie irresistibly, stomach-grippingly hilarious, though they did not understand all the jokes (example: the ""Let's Fight Venereal"" Talent Show). Though there were plenty of funny bits (such as the ""Tree Scene,"" the cafeteria dance number, the Mary vs. Evian fights, and Mary's talent show performance), I was not too impressed. In addition, the film was just too long! I do, however, have to say that I enjoyed Molly Shannon's fine acting. I didn't hate the movie, but I think that ""Superstar"" is basically just another goofy comedy for slightly immature moviegoers."
3,"Not bad for the price, I guess.","The movie is wonderful and the dvd was clear of any scratches, but the cover had permanent marker on her face that wouldn't come off. I know it was used, but it was marked as very good and that isn't very good in my opinion."
3,nice comedy,the story is bad and nothing in the moive but only Molly Shannon the way what she is do is realy nice .
3,it's okay,"Superstar was just okay. I would not need to see it again. It was not horrible, it was just not for me."
4,"SUPERSTAR is ""super-hysterical.""","SUPERSTAR is another movie based on a ""Saturday Night Live"" comic character--which in this case happens to be Mary Katherine Galleger (played by the halarious and sexy Molly Shannon).Mary is a Catholic high school student who is constantly dreaming of becoming a famous superstar, so she will get a kiss from the high school jock (played by Will Ferrell).This movie is better than some of the past ""SNL"" films like IT'S PAT, and manages to throw in some laughs as well.MTV comedian Tom Green (""V.D. rules!"") has a cameo, which makes this his first feature film."
3,"Relaxing, good dinner movie. Nothing more.","Molly Shannon is great. I do however feel, this being Saturday night live stuff, should be cut down to an hour and just be put down on T.V. Unfortuenly, we have to stick up another twenty minutes, so now it is a movie. Okay, some funny jokes but overall a whiny script just begging for attention."
2,SOME FUNNY MOMENTS BUT..................!,"What do you get when you take a 3 minute SNL skit and make a full length feature film out of it? Answer - SUPERSTAR! I really don't want to come down too hard on this goofy, but harmless film, because it does have it's moments. Molly Shannon and Co. do what they can with this mildly disturbing comedy with a predictable story. I rate it 2 stars in a good way!?....if that makes any sense."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:I have no idea who the audience for Superstar is supposed to be, for even people who like the Mary Katherine Gallagher character in short sketches are sure to tire of her after a full movie; another unfunny comedy for people who find stupidity inherently amusing, Superstar is not a movie to spend money or time on."
1,Stupid,"This movie is OK for kids who like stupid humor, but personally, it was really bad. It's like a 1 1/2 hour Saturday night live skit~They're great when they're only 5 mins. or whatever, but this movie is horrible. You might like it if you enjoyed Night at the Roxburry however"
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"Words cannot describe how horrible this movie is. The writing is awful, the acting is worse, and the plot is just plain stupid! Do not waste your time watching this movie! I wish the SNL producers would learn their lesson by now: 10 minute skits do not translate well into 90 minute movies, especially when the skit is not funny in the first place. Mary Katherine Gallagher is the worst character ever to stink up the silver screen, and I pray we've seen the last of her."
4,SUPER STAR IS BORN!,Mary is a normal catholic highschool girl. she wishes to be kissed by some hunky guy named Sky. but the thing is sky already has a girlfriend(Evion). the bratty popular girl. in order to get Sky's attention she will have to become a superstar! I like the part where she daydreams that everybody in the cafeteria is dancing with her.if you want to find out what happens at the end watch the movie!
4,Good,"I watched this with my mom, I thought it was halarious, but she thought it was stupid, I guess it wasn't THAT funny, but it's pretty good. I think it's a good movie for teen girls."
3,Decent,"This wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't the worst. Some of the jokes are downright stupid, but I like when she makes out with the tree. The ending is pretty dumb considering all the details, and then it gets even dumber just after...but who's idea was it to tell a kid their parents got ripped apart viciously by hammerhead sharks?"
5,LOVE IT!,"This is one of my favorite corny movies of all time. I can watch it again and again and again. Everytime I watch it, it gets even funnier! Give this video a chance... it's given all my friends and I a big laugh and I think it might make you giggle up a storm as well. Molly Shannon gives a great performance and so do all the rest of the characters. Very entertaining!"
3,Ha ha ha,"This movie was great , and funny it had me screaming S-U-P-E-R S-T-A-R during and after the movie . It`s so funny , you won`t even be able to watch the movie because you`ll be in the bathroom ,peeing from laghter."
3,Disappointing,"Most of the stories in this book are about women being strong and independent. Eve, Miriam, even the Woman of Valor, the impossibly perfect woman. Then I got to the story of Esther. Instead of telling how she hid her identity and saved her people from destruction, Ochs has chosen to tell the tale of how she became the queen because of her beauty. I get that her point was that Esther had the ability to reflect the beauty of others, which is an admirable trait. But if Ochs wanted to depict a strong woman, she should have chosen a better part of Esther's tale. Instead, we're shown how beauty can get you everywhere. How about a trip to 2005, Ms. Ochs?"
1,Biblical??,"I found this book in a used store and was very excited by the title - yes I would love to learn more about the women in the Bible! Lo and behold, it wasn't very Biblical - at all. I just read the first chapter about Eve and had enough. From a Christian perspective the idea that Eve gained wisdom by eating the fruit of good and evil, and how it helped her to become a wise woman, to the fictitious story by the author of her life after the garden just sets of alarms. There is no mention of God giving Eve wisdom, helping her, and it even mocks ""the boys"" (Adam and sons) for their inability to grasp concepts Eve could.This book is basically just the author writing her own make-believe version of how things were, how it applies to the modern woman and telling her experiences. Lovers of the Bible be warned."
5,Brilliant,"I just want to concur with the other reviews and add that Susana Trilling is a brilliant chef, period -- in Mexican cooking or otherwise. I don't understand it, but she really knows how to balance flavors in a way that is unique, compared to similar recipes I've followed. What makes one chef good and another great? I don't know - but she's got it, whatever it is!"
4,A Fact and Fun filled look at SG-1,"This book continues the trend of having authors/teachers/and others writing essays about TV popular culture. This book seemed to have a wider range, from physists, USAF Colonels, and popular writers, for the authors. Most of the essays were humorous and examined a wide range of topics. Even the more serious essays, that actually attempted to teach you the physics of the Stargate, did so with a little humor and a reasonable voice, not to dumbed down but not expecting you to know anything that the ususal E=mc2 information.If you like these type of books and like SG-1, you'll enjoy this. If you never read a book of essays on popular TV, try this one out. It's a nice friendly introduction to the genre."
5,Full of Charm and Wit,"If you want a game full of intelligent, quirky humor, over-the-top - in a good way - voice acting, and chock full of puzzles from the simple to the groan-inducing, look no further. Zork: GI fully immerses you in the world of Zork just as magic is being threatened by a tyrannical overseer. Armed with your wits and your trusty book of spells - such as ""turn purple things invisible"" - your job is to restore magic and salvage the kingdom.First person point-and-click puzzle/adventure game. Graphics are dated, but pleasant enough."
2,"What's It All About, Alphee?","My experience with Alphee Lavoie and his little astrology clique is a major turn-off. The book is fair, but there are many other Intermediate astrology books out there that are better in my opinion.NCGR would be better off to unhook from this small clique of members who are not friendly to other astrologers and other approaches."
5,This Book Is Awesome!,"As I read this book I kept getting goose bumps as the author told story after story of plant spirits healing various maladies. It made me want to go out and commune with the nearest plant! You'll find everything you need to get started on your plant spirit healing journey, but it will take the rest of your life to fully understand it, if ever. The author clearly comes from deep knowledge and experience of ancient healing secrets that are all but lost in the modern world.Between this book and ""The Secret Life of Plants"" by Christopher Bird, I'll never think of plants the same way again. They are indeed sentient beings and we can develop a profound relationship with them, a relationship that can bring us healing at a very deep level. Even if you are not interested in the healing aspect, this book will shift your reality. It is well written, entertaining, and powerful."
2,Not nearly as great as I'd hoped,"I had been looking forward to reading this book for a very long time and was sorely disappointed. I'm sure Cowan has some interesting techniques for healing through plant spirits, but he fails to share them with us in this book. Warning: This book is NOT about plants. This book is about Eliot Cowan and his (boring) pop-psychology, bumper-sticker approach to the human psyche. The book literally has quizzes to tell whether or not you are fear-dominated and lacking in earth or water or whatever... His long chapters on human psychology are not even insightful! Certainly nothing you couldn't find in the self-help section. I really recommend ""Sacred Plant Medicine"" by Buhner instead if you can find it. Otherwise, you'll learn way more about plant spirits by walking in the woods and having a chat with some plants instead of reading this book. I repeat: It is not about plants."
4,Miss guided by the review.,"While I enjoyed the book I thought I would get more pratical advise on ""how to"" I'm looking for salves, and older, wise, remedies."
4,I Love This Christmas CD!.,"This is a great CD, the songs are fun and they bring back good memories of listening to the songs when I was little and really I still love to listen to these songs and always will. I also have fond memories of watching the Christmas specials that these songs are from! All the songs on the CD are good but the best are Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Frosty The Snowman, Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, Holly Jolly Christmas, Jingle, Jingle, Jingle and Silver and Gold. I very highly recommend this CD for both the young and the young at heart!"
4,Vintage Rankin Bass Christmas Hits,"Terrific presentation of some childhood favorite tunes from the Rankin Bass holiday specials of yesteryear. All tracks appear to be pulled straight from the actual specials (as opposed to stand alone studio tracks), and sound brilliant and crisp (especially for music dating back to the late 60's and 70's). Exceptional tracks include 'Put One Foot in Front of the Other' from Santa Claus is Coming to Town' and 'The Most Wonderful Day of the Year' from the epic animagic special 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'. The only obvious deletions to this Sony collection are tunes from 'The Year Without a Santa Claus'. The Miser Brothers tunes are sorely missed, but perhaps there were licensing struggles to grab music from that particular special. However, for those who long for childhood memories rekindled of warmhearted Christmas specials from Authur Rankin and Jules Bass (and the mighty music of Maury Laws), this album is phenomenal and a must-have."
5,Awesome Christmas CD,"If you love to re-live your childhood or just love light and fun Christmas music - this CD is great. It is one of about 5 that I have as ""must-have"" Christmas CDs (Nat King Cole and Elvis are among those)."
5,The Best!!!!,The best of Christmas songs on one album for parents and children alike!I bought it for my three year old son. I wanted Christmas songs that were familiar to him and upbeat! This is it! It's mid January and he still requests it everytime we go for a ride in the car!!
4,So good to hear those voices of yesteryear.,"It's true that this CD is dominated a bit by The great Burl Ives' songs from ""Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer"". And maybe justly so. It does seem that ""Silver And Gold"" and ""Have A Holly Jolly Christmas"" outshine some of the non-title songs from the other specials.But then you also have Jimmy Durante's ""Frosty, The Snow Man"", Fred Astaire's ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"", and the exquisite recording of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by the Vienna Boys' Choir. Mickey Rooney is also in there, but I'm afraid his contribution didn't measure up to the others.All in all, this is definitely a worthwhile and highly recommended CD."
1,Alternative to this poor excuse,This collection of songs doesn't even scratch the surface of all the original music in the Rankin Bass library. I found an alternative this year to waiting for Warner or whoever owns them now. Find a program that allows you to extract audio from the DVDs and then create your own soundtracks. You can even find album art and tag the songs for each movie. Have a Holly Jolly Christmas!
2,Could have been so much better,"Good album for the kids, I guess, but it gets old real quick for the adults. First of all, it's so LOUD. I mean, the way it's mastered. I made a mix CD for my Kids for the car and the songs on this disc are waaaay louder than any others. I also don't understand the love for ""The First Toymakers to the King."" I wouldn't have included the song at all, as it's not very good, and not very Christmassy, and yet they have two different versions here. Also, why couldn't they have used any songs from ""The Year Without a Santa Claus?"" This would have earned a five-star rating if they had included the Heatmiser song. They would have benefited as well from some material from ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" - the one with the mice and the clock - another Rankin/Bass production."
3,A grand old critic in decline,"I've admired Rosenthal's writing for a long time, and I suppose this is why ""Running to Paradise"" comes as something of a disappointment. The commentaries on individual poems are too often little more than paraphrase, and there are a few points where he's factually inaccurate: he misidentifies the title character of ""To a Wealthy Man"" incorrectly, for example, as Yeats' own comments on the poem make plain. Rosenthal was in his late seventies when the book came out, and would die only two years later. While it's an inspiration to see a grand old critic working right on to the end of his life, it saddens me that this isn't up to the truly stellar standard Rosenthal set in his best work. That said, the writing is clear, and many of the comments will be useful for those coming to Yeats' work for the first time."
4,A creepy horror flick with great Nicholson,"While it's definitely not Stanley Kubrick's best film, ""The Shining"" is a definitely good movie. However, it's not quite up there with the likes of ""The Exorcist"" or ""Evil Dead."" The story, based on Stephen King's novel (though King hates the movie), is about the Torrance family moving to the Overlook Hotel to tend to it during the winter. The father Jack slowly begins to lose his mind and is soon chasing after his wife and son, which eventually goes outside into one of the scariest, most haunting chase scenes ever. The movie gets a little boring at times, with shots going a little longer than needed, but the story is very thick and we care for the characters. Jack Nicholson steals the show, however, in a role that will almost have you rooting for him, the villain! While it doesn't really mess with your mind, it still delivers the goods and is occasionally very, very scary."
3,"Great Movie, But bad DVD...","C'mon. This has to be the second best horror movie (below The Exorcist.) The acting. The camera work. The story. The music...all great! It's scary and funny (for those of you with a sick sense of humor) at the same time! It doesn't get much better than this!But there's only one problem; This DVD [is not good] what's up with the fullscreen format here? Not much bonus stuff either! The cover doesn't tell you much about the film and should be replaced.Well, that's about all I have to say, but hear this; This movie is great, so produce a special edition to go along with it..."
5,Stanley Kubrick's ultimate Masterpiece.,"This is one of, if not the greatest films ever made. It is extrmely heart-pounding, which is why it made number 21 on AFI's 100 Heart Pounding Movie Ever. This movie grabs you and doesn't let go, even after the film is over. I read the book. It is the greatest book I have ever read. This is my favorite movie. The book and the movie aren't even the same thing -- so don't put the movie down. The picture and sound quality is excellent, and the documentary before the film is awesome. This is the great horror film ever (tied with Evil Dead -- you should check it out). YOu must buy or rent this DVD."
4,"Less effects, more realistic, thus SCARIER","First, I have not read SK's novel, so I therefore cannot evaluate this based on the book. It is good though because that way, I would not be disappointed if the movie fell short from the book's story.I have seen the remake though & here is what I have to say. Kubrick's version is simpler, uses less horror effects (maybe technology constrainsts too or maybe his own option), is less gory but it comes out scarier than its remake version. The scenes focus on the actors' expressions instead of filling it up with cinematic gory effects thus leaving more room for the viewers' imagination. I commend the kid's acting as I find it extraordinary for a kid that age to express utmost fear as if it's real."
5,Blu-ray of THE SHINING the Best Version of This Film,"I won't go into the details of the plot of the picture. I just want to mention that the Blu-ray version of this film is the best I've seen it in years! The HD picture quality is amazing -- more clarity, depth, and richness of color. The Blu-ray also retains the original theatrical aspect ratio. (Even though the film was shot at 1.33:1 it was matted at 1.85:1 for movie theaters.) In the full screen version presented on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD, helicopter blades can be seen at the top of the screen during the opening credits. Obviously that was accidental.Most of the extras are from the older DVD version, but there are a few new extras on the Blu-ray too, like the commentary from the cinematographer. Overall, if you're a fan of this film, the Blu-ray version is highly recommended."
4,REDRUM-MURDER,"I really liked Stanley Kubrick's version of Stephen king's novel. I think Jack Nicholson was perfect guy for the lead role. Shelly Duvall, however, was one of the most annoying actresses ever cast in a horror movie. Yikes! Rebecca De Mornay put forth a much better performance in the T.V. remake. Little Danny was great. I guess the Kubrick and T.V. versions both had their strong points.The old lady in the bathtub scene was, and is, one of the creepiest horror scenes ever filmed. It made me cringe! And that slow-pounding heartbeat resonating throughout the movie was more creepy than walking through a morgue in the dark. Jack Nicholson's uncanny ability to bring out the lunatic in his character, with those devilish facial expressions, is an absolute treat to the fans of horror.Still very scary to this day, The Shining is one of my all-time favorite horror movies. They really knew how to make them back in those days."
2,Sorry - this one misses the mark,"The Shining remains my favorite Stephen King book because I still think it was the scariest book I ever read. You can imagine my excitement when I heard that S. Kubrick was making a movie out of the book. I was so disappointed I felt like crying. First of all: Shelly Duvall is so irritating in her sniveling, weepy acting I ended up WANTING Jack Torrence to kill her and end the suffering (of the audience). Secondly, Jack Nicholson seems a bit creepy in real life so he probably didn't have to put much extra effort into the role to be Jack Torrence, the maniac. It was further frustrating that Scat Man Cruthers was killed in the movie (his character in the book does not die) after traveling all the way back to the Overlook Hotel to save Wendy and Danny and then dies as soon as he walks in the door. The little boy who portrayed Danny did an excellent job of acting. Too bad he didn't have a better script to act from. Sorry - big disappointment."
4,"""One Of Jack's Best!""",Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall star in Stanley Kubrick's 1980horror film based on Stephen King's novel. A man tries to killhis family when he becomes caretaker of an old hotel. This isone of Jack's best and I'm glad I got this special edition thathas nice picture and sound plus neat extras. Definitely addthis to your horror collection.
3,"Good film, awful adaption.","To Mr. Fowler, who describes a Stephen King fan as ""card carrying groupie"" and that Stephen King is a sick weirdo has a LOT to learn. first, didnt Kubrick direct a film where someone is beat to death with a ceramic penis? Huh? Who is the sick weirdo now? With the film, it is inferior to the greatness of the book. It is however good in horror terms. Well directed, and often tense, Kubrick should've changed the names and do the film differently. Then, people will like it without criticising to the original."
1,disappointed,I read the reviews saying the hd version was a better copy and did not see anywhere that you need a special hd player. So we can not watch the movie.
3,It could have been better,"The problem with The Shining is that is throws you in at the deep end as soon as you switch on the TV. The main character, who goes crazy, is meant to be affected by the hotel but seems to be crazy before he even arrives! It is more about a guy who just plain old goes under with cabin fever, not some mystical force horror flick. The adaption from King's master piece was disappointing. That said I would love to one day see the director's cut, I think it would do the book far more justice and be a far better film. 3 stars."
5,Very pleased,Another cult classic. Love the DVD. Extremely fast shipping. Great job Amazon. You are a great source of finding DVD that I enjoy.
3,Frightening,"This film is disturbing and scary. It kept me on the edge of my seat for almost all of its two and a half hours running length. In Kubrick's tale things start to get spooky at a remote Colorado hotel, and as the characters discover they are trapped, so we discover we are trapped with them, shut up in an amazing labyrinth with an axe-wielding madman we have suddenly found out we cannot trust.Music (mainly by the Hungarian composer Bela Bartok) and camerawork are the chief contributors to the atmosphere of a film which is one of the few genuinely frightening I have experienced."
5,The Shining is an excellent modern horror film,"I am a Jack Nicholson freak, and I thought that The Shining was, maybe not one of his BEST, but definitely a great achievement. Stephen King's novel is shown on the screen wonderfully. It's just plain a great film! If you haven't seen it, see it!"
2,not so great,the movie is scary but it does not follow the book well at all if you have not read the book though i recomend this for you.
5,Listen to Dave Mack! The others are misinformed.,"This movie was widescreen in the theaters! Kubrick only ""preferred"" full-screen video releases of his films because the only other option in the 80's was to crop the sides of the picture off. There was no such thing as anamorphic widescreen dvds or widescreen tvs when this was his ""preference"". Instead they removed the matting on the tops and bottom to make the image square (more or less) for tv. This sometimes revealed things not meant to be seen (helicopter shadows in the opening etc.)If you've ever seen Pee-Wee's Big Adventure in full screen you know what I mean. In that you could see dolly tracks, the never ending bike chain coming up under his bike etc.The original aspect ratio was WIDESCREEN. That's the image we were meant to see. The old dvd of The Shining was a crap job, and not the original aspect ratio. The ""director's preferred version"" was a way out of context comment. The studio just didn't want to bother remastering the film last time."
1,You're money's no good here Mr Torrance.,"This edition is a cynical attempt by the studio to cash in on the media attention surrounding the director's final work. This is manifest in the poor quality of the DVD transfer that shares none of the attention to detail for which the director was renowned. Much of the visual artistry originally created by the director has been lost with the outrageous 4-by-3 TV framing. In a slapdash attempt to redo the opening titles, the film loses several minutes of the dramatic opening helicopter sequence, transforming a perfectly orchestrated build-up into a happy-go-lucky made-for-TV movie."
3,THE SHINING,"VERY LOOSE ADAPTATION OF THE STEPHEN KING HORROR NOVEL ABOUT A WRITER AND HIS FAMILY,SNOWBOUND IN A HUGE HOTEL,WHO EXPERIENCE VARIOUS HAUNTINGS CAUSED EITHER BY THE HOTEL ITSELF OR THE WRITER'S DEMENTIA.TECHNICALLY STUNNING AND PRETTY DAMN SCARY,BUT TOO LONG.PRETENTIOUS AND IMPLAUSIBLE.NICHOLSON IS EXCELLENT AS THE FAILED WRITER GONE OFF THE DEEP"
3,Ok but not the best scary movie,I have seen a lot of scary movies and this one was more then the other ones are but it still was just not appealing to me as a horror flick. I think this a grate movie to see if you are looking for a thriller but not a scream scream horror flick.
5,The best director and best actor in one great movie.,"Not only does this movie have Jack Nicholson, one of the greatest actors, but it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, the greatest director. Some say the T.V. version that was made a couple years back is better. They don't know anything. No one can capture the pure insanity of Jack Taurance better than Nicholson. In the T.V. version, Jack was played by that very mediocre actor that was on that horrible show, ""Wings"". Now I never read the book, but I've heard that the T.V. version was a lot more like the book. But, who cares? In movies, I look for quality, not how accurate it is. Shelly Duvall gets annoying at times, but overall this movie is a classic. It contains classic Kubrick camerawork, (which I love so much) and Nicholson's performance is amazing. A must-see."
4,this is 1 of Kubricks best!,"This is one of the top kubrick films on my list along with ""Full metal jacket"",""barrylyndon""and of course""a clock work orange"" this is also one of my top 20 scarriest movies along with the ""exorsist"" ""chainsaw massacre"" etc. + the fact that the book was written by one of my favorite authers Stephen King if you have not yet witnessed the horror of the shining I highly reccomend it."
2,Shining dull,"I love Jack Nicholson and watch all his films, however, this is the first time I have seen this one and, obviously, it was dated (26 years old). I felt that it was overacted by him and Shelley Duval. Little Danny was probably the best actor in this film in my opinion. However, I found it all a bit unconvincing."
2,a disappointment,"let's be honest.jack nicholson's portrayal here is so completely over the top as to be comedic. not a good thing for what purports to be a horror film.it's a shame, because the cinematography is good, as is the supporting cast.poor stephen king has not been served well by the cinematic treatment of his films.the only one worth a damn is ""the dead zone.""and, no, i'm not talking about the putrid television remake, but the original one starring christopher walken, an actor who is unrivaled when he's taking his acting and the project seriously."
4,Grown into it,"This was on TV the other night, and I really have come to appreciate it as a classic. I made the mistake of seeing it at the show when it first came out a day after I had finished the book."
3,audio problems,"Great movie.On my dvd the audio track does not match up exactly with the video, it made it a little annoying to watch. It looked to be a new copy in the box."
5,A classic.,"With the gifs on tumblr and everything, it was definitely something I wanted to see but my parents never had it. I never watched this movie but since I've always heard stuff about it I decided to order it. It's really a good movie and I see why everybody still loves it years after it was made. I'd recommend it to anyone. The product came fast and in excellent condition."
5,finally released with some tastey extras,this is the first film i can remember seeing. and for good reason. how can a seven year old erase these scenes from his psyche? it's one of the best. enjoy the extras on the new release.best horror; the shining/the changeling/the exorcist/suspria/texas chainsaw massacre/psycho/legend of hell house/
5,"""its almost like ive been here before""","**MAY CONTAIN SPOLIERS**First off, let me say WOW. I just finnished this movie, and I came out of the living room in shock. This movie is truly horriyfing, and truly analyzes the transformation from a nice and caring father to a man without a heart stopping at nothing to murder his family and relive the past of the OVERLOOK HOTEL. In the beginning you are introuduced to the TORRENCES. Jack Torrence has accepted a job at the beautiful yet haunting OVERLOOK HOTEL to leave the hectic life of the city and spend several months of peace and quite to work on his novel. When he accepts the job as the care taker for the winter, the whole family moves up into the isolated hotel and starts to relive the horror that awaits in every corridor, around every corner, and in each and everyone of the spirits that are locked within the monstrous walls."
3,Didn't Really Follow the Book,"I saw this movie directly after reading the book, and the book is FAR superior. I was disappointed with the room 217 portrayal. I can't believe the movie and the book are about the same thing. The book is too long and complex to be summerized in a short 2 hour movie. Jack Nicholson's character was difficult to understand, and the book explained a lot more.In addition, the 4 hour TV version is 100 times better. The TV movie followed the book perfectly, and left me with a satisfied feeling. The TV movie was exactly what I pictured when I read the book. I can't believe that the TV movie isn't for sale."
5,It still gives me chills,"This movie definitely ranks in my top five favorites, if not my favorite. Jack Nicholson plays the part of a lunatic perfectly, the directing is superb, Shelly Duvall is almost exactly how I pictured Wendy when I read the book, and Danny's visions make the movie. REDRUM, the blood in the elevator, and those two little girls in the hallway are scenes that still scare me just thinking about him, as is the shot where Danny is making his soundless scream. Spine-tingling. It is definitely among Stanley Kubrick's best movies, as well as probably the best horror flick ever."
3,perception is everything,"understand, ye who walk into this theater, that without a clear awareness of the object absurdity of human existance, you will not be amused. this statment by one of few true masters in the art of film is a flawed masterpiece of black humor. if you have ever looked at life around you and for a moment thought about how ridiculous it all is then i highly suggest you expose yourself to this gloriously honest manipulation of the senses."
2,"sort of boring, unfortunately","I have tried to sit through this movie at least three times, but I lose interest and always find it boring. Nothing in this movie scares me, I never belive that Jack Nicholson is a Dad, or Shelly is his wife. I like Stanley's other movies quite a bit though.I don't like the newer versions of this movie either, they're boring too. I do like most of King's books and movies though. I guess I must be one of the small few who don't like this story very much."
1,laughable at best,"Anyone who has ever read the book knows that this movie is based on someting other then the king novel. Not one thing is true to the book and The movie is laughable at best. There isn't one thing scary about it either. It is some of the flat out worst acting I have ever seen it my life. How any one can praise and even somewhat like this movie is completly lost to me.Like the novel silence of the lambs the scariest and most improtant scences in the novels where completly left out of the movie.This movie is just terrible. I actually could barely stand to seat through the entire thing. Danny talkin to his fingure which is ""supposed to be tony"" was just bad. see in the bood tony is an actual person that he sees far of in the distance(sortof) not his fingure. I could pount out ever little bad part about this movie but I just don't have the time.Please skip the movie and read the book. It is one of the best I have ever read and more scary then the movie(which actually isn't)"
2,"A good film, but there are some problems","This film would be great if they had not made such a horrible editing mistake at the start of the film. As you see the main character's VW Bug driving to the hotel during the opening credits, there are several great helicopter shots. In one shot, you can see the shadow of the helicopter on the side of the mountain. It makes the film appear cheap and not well made. If they would fix this short shot, and edit that out, then the film would be wonderful. I understand this film is good, don't get me wrong, but little mistakes so obvious take away from the overall effect of the film, and make it look like no effort was put into production."
3,Scarey film to be sure,But I don't get all these thoughts by viewers on supposed deeper inner themes. It just all seems to be about a man who went and took a job as a hotel caretaker and the spirits in the hotel noted that he looked like a guy who used to work there. Therefore they took over his body and mind. Simple enough explanation--no?
2,The Shining,"The Shining has not withstood the test of time; technically this film is skillfully done, the atmosphere is realistic but not altogether successful, there is an empty argument about the child that is not resolved, and that ruins the movie is undoubtedly Jack Nicholson, a good actor, not very versatile but here's terribly overacted and mocker, who with his clown face is not convincing in his transformation, too bad that Stanley Kubrick did not moderate this . Long ago I saw and I do not impress, I've seen and now I am disappointed more but never was and never will be a horror classic."
5,Very nice classic,I loved it I am not sure why I have waited so long to watch this classic movie but it worth to watch. I scared though : ) I think because it is a very old movie and very slow I was okay to watch usually I am scared of horror movies. It is old style to scare people with axes and physical harassment. Nowadays the most scare movies are all about the brain movements.
4,Still Creepy!!,"I watched this with my teen daughter and her boyfriend. It still gave me the creeps, and had them on the edge of there seat. It it a bit slow leading up to the climax, but man Jack Nicholson is worth it!!! He is by far one of the scariest characters yet!!"
3,It's Ok movie,I watched this movie due the reviews I found here in amazon. But I did not like movie as it's been reviewed here. It's genre is horror but I don't think there is any scene there that frighten you. All together it's ok movie.
4,Great movie after all these years,"Still a fantastic movie even after seeing it 10+ times. Picture quality is great, not as clear as ""newer"" HD-DVD movies but still very good. The extra detail could be a minus because some things look very fake. Remember the scene near the end with the person in that bear suit? Remember thinking WTF is with all this? In the HD-DVD version, the costume looks like a $5 buck cheapo rental taking away some of the insanity of that sceneA lot of bonus features like a ""Making Of"" and cast interviews. If you liked this movie at all it's a great addition to your HD-DVD collection"
5,Best horror movie ever!!!,I'll make it short. This is the ONLY movie that made me have a nightmare after watching it. EVER!
5,"Hypnotic, Terrifying and Disturbingly Decadently Entertainin","The Shining is one of the scariest best films ever made. It is best to view it as a seperate entity from the book. Obviously, one film couldn't have contained the rich terror and subplots of the King novel. The Shining is great for its arresting images, Nicholson's over the top performance, the creepiness of the two girls... Though Danny's ""shine"" can be at times laughable and silly and the ending is pretty bad, this film is really worth seeing for the performances and cinematography alone. A winner."
5,Horror's finest feature,"The Shining is an excellent film. It made the AFI's (American Film Institute) top 100 most thrilling films. It is about a struggling writer/alcoholic (Nickloson) who slowly goes crazy while occypying a hotel in the winter months. His wife and son (Duvall and Danny Lloyd) also give great performances. Lloyd's young performance was as good, if not better than Haley Joel Osment's in The Sixth Sense. But be forewarned, this film containes nudity, violence/gore, and language (mainly by Jack)."
4,"""I'm not gonna hurt you, I'm just going to-""","Objectively, this is not a good movie. It's one-dimensional, Jack's character lacks any depth, and despite the 2 1/2 hour length, NOTHING actually happens until the last twenty minutes or so.Subjectively, however, I know few people, including myself, who don't believe that the movie is dazzling to look at and creepy as all hell.Anyone wanting some meat is directed to the novel.And to think that Danny Lloyd didn't even know they were making a horror film..."
5,The Shining is a Visual Treat!,"Even though it deviates from the book, this a horror movie classic. I love watching it for all the architectural details and that moment when Jack is completely consumed by the Overlook."
1,Thumbs down for Warner Brothers!,"I am a big fan of Nicholson, Kubrick, King and of the film THE SHINING. So naturally I had to add it to my DVD collection. What a lousy DVD! The sound quality sucked! I had to turn my dolby digital surround system all the way up, which under normal circumstances would get myself evicted from the premises. With the volume all the way up I still had problems making out some of the text. Another Warner Brothers DVD that sucks for the same reason is BONNIE AND CLYDE which also has a nasty hum."
2,What?,"Not scary at all. Nothing compared to the book. If you scare easily, haven't read the book, and have nothing at all to do, then this is the movie for you. I for one thought that it was stupid. If you're looking for a scare then read the book. It was awsome!"
1,I just didn't care.,I didn't care one bit about anyone in this movie. I found myself not caring about someone going crazy and killing his family...because I didn't care about him or his family. I just didn't care...ever. And I didn't find it the least bit scary. I couldn't wait for it to get over. I like most King movies...but this one just dragged on forever.
1,Worst movie of all time,"I would rather watch a litter of puppies being thrown into a wood chipper than this abortion of a movie. Other than the names of some of the characters and the setting of the Overlook, there are no similarities with the book, literally none. How could King give the okay for this version, it makes me sick. I haven't seen the miniseries yet, but it's hard to believe it could be any worse. What a waste of some good acting, too. Nicholson playing the real Jack Torrance would have been terrifying."
1,Least scary movie EVER made,"I went to rent the remake of the ""Friday the 13th"", but the cashier told me to check out ""The Shining"" instead for some quality horror. I was skeptical but approached it with an open-mind, even though I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the Friday the 13th remake. Boo! This movie sucked! The things in it were so random, like the bear suit guy and the blood spilling down the stairs. They didn't even have to do with the plot. The acting was horrible, too. I was hoping Wendy would've been axed already so she'd finally shut up and get back in the kitchen! This movie is so un-scary that I thought I'd never be scared again. Then I saw gems like ""Orgy of the Dead"", ""Dead End Road"", ""The Dentist"" and ""Turistas"" and realized that good horror films do exist, just skip this Shining crap!"
4,"A classic horror film, but truly not very frightening","I love The Shining and I saw it for the first time when I was 9 or 10. It scared me back then. Now, being 24, it still creeps me out, but as a whole, it really isn't a frightening movie. Thats not to say it isn't a good one. It is. The 2 little girls in the hall...There is no scarier image. It has been ingrained in my mind ever since I first saw it. The tense atmosphere certainly helps the movie out and the climax is quite suspenseful. The true reason this movie is rated so high is because of Jack Nicholson. He created this perfectly creepy character and people still quote him years later. He is the reason the movie succeeds in being a horror/thriller. Great actors make great movies, well mostly. Obviously over 20 years old, the movie look dated and bland at times, but it still stands the test of time and that is the most important thing. If you are looking for real scares however, look somewhere else."
2,THE TV REMMAKE WAS MUCH BETTER,I now that a bunch of people love this movie but i personally found it kind of boring but it was totally bad. if it had been edited better it could be really good thre are to many scenes of the kid biking down the hall. also it o differnt for the book it is not the wrost steph king adaption ever but defntily not he best. I hope the 1997 version comes to video
1,why do so many people like this movie ??,i just dont know why everyone thinks this movie is a classic. i think it was just plain DUMB and stupid. i got to say this movie was a little scary... but it was annoying and very boreing for me. i really did not want to finish it but since i wasted my money on renting it i would just give it a chance. 1 thing i like about this movie is the REDRUM thing. thats a classic !!!!! so if you are looking for a nice great scary movie with a great plot and horror. i WOULD NOT buy this movie. but you should probably give it a chance and rent it to see if you like it.... anyways i HATED IT.
1,This shine needs some polish,Yes Kubrick was a great director but this was a mess of a miss. Read the book and see why all the real horror did not make it to the screen. The movie had way too much lighting in it to be scary as well. When I saw this in the theatres everyone booed the anti-climactic end. Kubrick never learned how to make a great horror film. Jack Nicholson over-acting all over the place does not make a great film. If there was ever a reason for Hollywood to re-make a horror film ah la The Omen.....well lets go-Im waiting. Just not Tom Cruise. Boooo!!!!!
2,not great,"Kubrick was so good with Barry Lyndon, and other work, but The Shining was awful, and it could have been so good, with the talent involved. But Jack's wife(as portrayed) was so horrible...and what about the sex? and that stupid thing with the Finger? I'm not King fan, but The Shining(book) I did like, King finally writes about something he has personal knowledge of (alcoholism), the only work of his that has ever rung true for me.This movie could have been so good. What a disappointment."
2,STANLEY KUBRICK'S BOMB,"The ShiningAn ugly, hard-to-stomach horror movie, from Stanley Kubrick, whose sense of taste and feeling for his character have somewhat dulled. His source: Stephen's King's novel, was a horrifing tale, too, but King evokes a sence of concern for his characters which has totally eluded Kubrick's work here. Jack Nicholson is suitably menancing but Shelly Duvall is almost ludricrously weak."
2,"boreing ""shining""","i must say i stand alone in thinking this is the most boring horror film i have ever seen. while the movie is a little creepy in never really clicks. nothing really happens until the last 10 min. and by then it's to late. what were left with is nicholson, in another of his way over the top roles. it's not all his fault as kubrick never raines him in. nicholson just goes crazy,no build up or reason giving and it really hurts the film. we never understand what the forces in the hotel do to push him into madness, so there is no real chance to care about him or the family.i found myself looking at my watch way to many times as the film wore on and on. with all the talent involved this should have been better than it is. the two stars is given because of the creepy factor. a missed chance for greatness here."
2,It is OK,This movie was ok but the book was so much better. The book actually scared me unlike the movie.
3,Here's Johnny,"Based on the Stephen King novel, Jack Nicholson stars as Jack Torrence with Shelly Duvall as his wife. How a family collapses when a father can't perform his duty as provider and protector. And then of course there's the redrum- murder spelled backwards- with the kid. A family moves into a remote hotel only to awaken the ghosts of residences past, causing Jack Torrence to lose his mind. This time around when I saw it, it didn't scare me, it's just crazy acting with Nicholson in a blue chipper performce. Compared to scary me witless in 9th grade in just the opening few minutes. A true gem of a horror film, even if it isn't scary."
4,The Shining,"Excellent movie classic, beautiful scenery, and takes the effects of the winter doldrums to an extreme."
5,THE GREATEST FILM OF THE CENTURY!,"Jack Nicholson gives a great performance as writer and family man Jack Torrence, who becomes crazy and chases his family with an axe. Packed with extremely kinky nudity, sensational suspense, and graphice violence."
4,Great old classic,I enjoyed this old classic that was one of the first films that used new photography techniques to film it.
5,Fantastic HD DVD!,"This is one of the best-looking & best-sounding HDs I've seen. It didn't seem like the kind of film that would benefit from an HD upgrade, but it makes an amazing difference. The film looks new, with such a sharp image and brilliant colors that you'd never guess it was almost 30 years old. Much like the new Blade Runner Final Cut, the picture & sound are so much better that you feel like you're watching the film for the first time, and appreciating it more fully than ever before.VERY highly recommended!"
2,Read the book!,I have seen the moive too many times to count. I don't know why since it gets worse each time I watch it. Jack Nicholson is unbeliveable as Jack. In the book you sorta feel bad for him but the moive makes him unllikeable. The plot should have followed the movie more.
2,Overrated,"5 stars? One of the greatest horror films ever made? Please. This so-so adaption of one of Stephen King's best novels, for all the time and craft Kubrick spent on the film, is only mildly scary. Some of the scenes have a certain creepiness, but story-wise this is totally lame. Nicholson is of course, excellent, playing a twisted caretaker who slowly goes mad, but unfortunately, it comes as no surprise as he seems ready to go off the deep end from the first scene. Or how about the so-called 'suspenseful buildup' of having Scatman Crothers travel up the mountain to save the family, only to immediately get an axe in the chest?! And the maze was only a mild substitute for the topiary as described in the book. I love Kubrick, but have to admit, he should have let someone else help with the screenplay. I first saw it when I was 14 years old, and I still feel the same - disappointed, and not scared."
5,Blood Bath,"If you believe in ghosts then this is what you need to see. Also if you enjoy watching movies that got lots and lots of blood. This has some sort of Pet Cemetary theory to it. Warnings and images, much drama and a pool of blood every now and then."
4,CREEPY!,"On my Stephen King kick. I was disappointed in this movie. The music was WAAAAAY over the top. The acting was very good (especially Jack Nicholson-- CREEPY!), however, and I was scared. Still, I felt like I didn't really know what was going on and there wasn't enough development of the story. At two hours and some change, it's not short, but they spend too much time on the set-up and not enough on the development. (I know it's hard to make a novel into a movie. Guess this is just one of those shortfalls.) Anyway, it was scary, and I did look over my shoulder in the shower once or twice this morning."
2,The ghost of Kubrick,"It's a pretty good measure of the boredom and disengagement that befuddled the last half of Stanley Kubrick's career that he would stoop to filming a ghost story. Having disposed of topics like nuclear war and the fate of the human race in ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""2001,"" it must have been well-nigh impossible to come up with a story that satisfied his appetite for big projects. ""The Shining"" dodges Stephen King's usual imbecilities as long as it can, holding out the hope that the title character is just going mad and isn't being plagued by ghosts. But eventually Kubrick gives in and turns loose the spooks. With or without them the whole thing is way too slow. Kubrick must have sensed how bad it all was: he reportedly lost his temper repeatedly with Shelly Duvall's awful performance, and the kid is terrible, too."
4,"Classic post-modern horror,but where is Saul Bass cover art?","This is a classic horror movie full of atmosphere, dread, icy chills, haunting visons, madness, etc but...WHY did WB deem it necessary to change the original acclaime and very cool SAUL BASS cover art (you know, the YELLOW shot with signature logo and spectre face) for the current ""Here's Johnny!"" close-up of Jack - I think putting the original cover art (the same image/motif which appeared on the 1980 one-sheet) would be a much more classy way to present this movie on DVD. Oh well. At least we have the old trailer - classic stuff. Less is more."
1,One of the worst film adaptations of a King novel.,"El Stinko! Hammy Nicholson overshadows a story that was supposed to be about the boy. Not scary, not intelligent. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GROANER. If you want to see a better version of The Shining see the TV four hour version. It blows the movie version away, while this one just blows."
5,Blu Ray is the only way for this masterpiece.,"Okay, I must say. The Shining is an amazing film, it's suspenseful and scary. I will say that the way the atmosphere and and cinematography was really brought up on the Blu Ray transfer. It added more to Kubrick's horror masterpiece. It also has a lot of bonus material to keep the viewer happy. Not only that, it also has a play back option so when you take the disc out and put it back in the movie will play back where you left off which is convenient. The picture could not be any better/ clear. If you want to get the shining, get it on Blu Ray!"
5,JACK IS BACK,This is Jack at his best as he plays this fairly normal book writer who takes over a Colorado hotel for the winter as a caretaker with his wife and son. The events that follow are total Jack going crazy and putting his poor family through the worst possible nightmare. I have seen this movie like many others have over and over again it is just that good.Nobody should be without a copy in their video bookcase.
2,Why no widescreen???,"What a waste of a fantastic release opportunity that this great movie, with beautiful cinematography, but NOT WIDESCREEN. We are missing so much of the ""picture"" in this picture that it is a shame."
2,Kubrick's vision falls waaaaay short once again.,"Hard to disagree with Stephen King himself on that point. Highly disappointing if you're a King fan, but if you're another robotic Stanley Kubrick worshipper you will probably love this thing.There's nothing scary or terrifying here, except Danny's constant spastic shaking and drooling, unless of course you're one of those people that has a habit of looking under your bed at nite to see if the boogeyman has paid you a visit. Boo!And if I was stranded on a mountain in a haunted hotel, no doubt that Scatman Crother's would be my first choice for a rescue. haw haw Some semi-haunting and nifty visuals as you might expect but the story doesn't gel, and people...you'll want Shelley Duvall to be disposed of in the most gruesome manner possible. What were they thinking casting her in the part of Wendy?Nicholson was great in his prime, but this movie could have been so much better. King's best work gets the chop on the altar of artistic creativity. Two Axes."
2,Terrible adaptation,"Stephen King's The Shining is by far his best novel, imho anyway. I was very disappointed with Kubrick's adaptation, as it changed many of the most important facts of the story. It was especially disappointing, considering his genius adaptation of ACO. Though very beautifully and masterfully done, as a fan of the novel, I have a hard time recommending this film (per)version."
4,All Work and No Play Makes Stanley a Dull Boy,"This was a terrific horror movie. The acting was great. Jack Nicholson did a good job as Jack Torrance. Scatman Crothers did a wonderful job as the role of Dick Hallorann. Danny Lloyd did great as Danny, especially in the ""REDRUM"" scene. Stanley Kubrick was the right director for this movie. I might want to see the miniseries but I think this version is better. This is one of my favorite scary movies of all time. I recommend this to everyone!!"
5,Aspect ratios,"Kubrick said to his photographer on the Shining, ""the frame is exactly 1.85:1."" ""Obviously, you compose for that but protect the full 1.33:1 area."" Hence, the new dvd and blu-ray are the closest to being correct. Why closest? They're slightly blown up to 1.78:1."
5,A great Kubrick!,"It's much more than a great horror film, it's a wonderful work of art! It has sense of humor, inteligence and refinement - something that we don't find in regular horror films. If you like any of Stanley Kubrick's films you'll certainly love it (pay atention in its use of sound). And in this new release (not just in DVD, but in VHS) we can see also the original trailer (a masterpiece in itself!)and a short (and very good) making of."
1,Full screen?!! Are they insane?,"Can someone please illuminate me on this perplexing situation? I'd heard that this was to be a Kubrick-approved collection of his films on DVD. Is it possible he decided to have it released full-screen? Is this just penny-pinching by Warner execs who took the scan off some old Laserdisc edition of the flick? Was the top and bottom of the film cropped to create a wider aspect ratio for theatrical release? Or is this just an unfortunate typo by Amazon.com?Unless the cropping scenario is true or this turns out to be just a typo or miscommunication on Amazon.com's part, I'll save my cash and live with my memory of the film as I originally saw it(okay, I saw it full-screen on videotape the first time -- I was one when it was originally released in theaters -- but memory makes great films widescreen in retrospect).Any information pertaining to these questions would be delightful."
3,a classic horror movie,"This is a great horror movie for those of you who accept hack & slash tactics as scary. For true Stephen King fans, the Kubrick film is a pale shadow loosely based on the novel. While I am a huge fan of Jack Nicholson, the movie quickly degenerates into a too long chase scene with Shelly Duvall screaming shrilly & constantly. Totaly helpless, in spite of the fact her child's life is in danger. Any attempt to follow the book is lost at this point. If you enjoy reading, do read the book. Even the made for TV series,(while much more satisfactory), is not quite the same. There comes a point where you have to cut something, & sacrifices are necessary. Unfortunate, but true. Best of all, read the book, & watch both movies. Make up your own minds. For those of you with a short attention span, & little or no imagination, stick with the Kubrick version. It's right up your alley. Of course, for a proper rebuttal, all 3 must be compared. Only fair you know.....BS"
1,Dreadful DVD,"I had never seen such an incompetent job as that done by Warner Bros. when creating this DVD. The image is not much better than you get in an ordinary VCR, and the sound is absolutely terrible (which was a big turnoff for me, as I was looking forward to hearing the awesome piece by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind booming in surround sound against the stunning background of the mountains around the Overlook.)This DVD does The Shining (a truly good movie that turns a run-of-the-mill horror story into a subtle psychological-supernatural tragedy) a big disservice.The movie is a five star one; the DVD, a one star one (and that's because I am not allowed to give no stars.)"
5,Simply a masterpiece,By any standard this is one of the greatest sci fi films of all time. Nicholson and Shelly Duvall are at their best. It would rank high on my list of the greatest films of any genre ever made.
3,Not THAT good...,"Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is about three people who live in an old hotel for nearly a year, alone, with almost no outside contact. The main character, Jack, goes absolutely beserk after living in the hotel for about three months and tries to kill his family, Danny and Wendy, who are there as well. The film is very slow-paced, and it is really hard to get into. The film doesn't get really interesting until about an hour and a half in, when Jack starts going crazy. Danny, Jack's son, has this magical power called The Shining and can see into the hotel's colorful past, bringing up disturbing images of chopped up girls, nude old women in bathtubs and ten gallons of blood pooring out of a elevator. The film is definitely not for children, hence the R rating, due to graphic violence/gore, full frontal nudity, tons of strong profanity, and deeply disturbing images. People 14 and under - stay away!"
4,Nice but somewhat disappointed I suppose,"I think the blu ray does this film alot of justice. I did enjoy finally seeing it this way. But have to admit disappointment in that I was expecting to see something along the lines of an extended cut or deleted scenes. This release has none of that which considering the brilliance of this film. Is probably for the better.I found the new documentary(s) a little on the tedious side. Listening to Hollywood people spout on and on about how brilliant Kubrick was gets to be pretty annoying after you've heard it a dozen times. It's like, yeah... we got it people. Tell us something we don't already know."
5,"I don't know how it's scary, but it is.","This is possibly the greatest horror movie of all time. It's creepy, but not over the top. It's scary, but not in a BOO! kind of way. There is a lot of detail without being overblown, and there's Jack Nicholson. It could be that the cinematography is out of this world, with long pacing shots and slow panoramic views. The acting is superb, espeically the typewriter scene. Amazing movie, one of a kind. Now, I got to get off because there's a thunderstorm at my house."
5,The shining rocks!!!,"Excellent item ,great picture.Quality is awesome.An old classic presented the way it should be.Totally worth its money"
5,The best,"The best movie ever adapted from King's novel, a timeless masterpiece, great story and really creepy, a must own....Enjoy."
4,scream 2 is the best cause it had motives piont blank.,scream 2 i't's the best cause it'smotives in it
5,The demons of the reason!,"A writer is passing through an unfruitful period of inspirational rapture. He is hired with all his family to regent a hotel during a long and crude winter. The payment is attractive and the change may bring him new airs in his artistic profile.But there are many unsaid weird events. Dark visions occur repeatedly, curious spirits invade the intimacy of this family. Gradually these visions will grow with major intensity, and eventually will affect the mental sanity of this writer. The progressive inner dissolution will reach unexpected levels of tension, and physical violence against his own family.Stanley Kubrick once more, dictated a true Directorial Cathedra. His wonderful travelings, and original camera angles, the astonishing and suspenseful script plus the mercurial performance of Jack Nicholson made of this film one of the favorite icons of many hard fans all around the world."
4,"Greak flick, bad adaptation!","This movie is pretty good, but not for Stephen King fans. Unfortunately I saw this film before I read the book, but I'm smart enough to understand that it extremely bastardized the original story. If you expect to enjoy this film, you have to watch it with the attitude that it's not based on Stephen Kings work at all, but just some really cool horror film that Stanley Kubrick cooked up, otherwise you won't like it at all. That is, if you've read the book, which I have."
2,Not At All Wonderful!!!,"Good movie??.. No way!!.. This is a horrible adaptation of one of Stephen King's greatest novels. This movie isn't scary at all and it completely lost the creepy, twisted Stephen King touch. The second movie, that was played in multiple parts on television, was a lot closer to the book and was much much better. This movie wasn't at all what I expected. It was a lot worse, I don't recommend it at all, unless you're completely bored and want to watch a very bad movie. Jack Nicholson was the perfect choice for Jack Torrance, but Shelly Duvall??... she looked like a lost and very awkward giraffe running around that huge hotel in the end scenes. She's not at all what one would expect Wendy to be like. Bottom line: MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!"
3,3.8,"This movie didn't [...]. It blew me away though. For someone, me, who hasn't been able to show emotion in a long time, because I'm extremely messed up, this movie scared me so that my intestine didn't allow excretion. I still dream about those two small girls at night. No, not in that way."
2,Weak Adaptation,"In spite of Kubrick's impressive and unmistakeable style... In spite of Nicholson and Duvall's remarkable performances... the weak novel's flaws are magnified rather than minimized in translation to the screen. There is little here that will frighten you--and, unlike most other Kubrick films, still less upon which to ponder."
4,A Tour de Force from JACK!,"Jack Nicholson has always been considered one of our generation's greatest screen actors. And ""The Shining"" goes a long way to proving why this is still the case. In a lesser actor's hands, his character would have become a joke - yet Nicholson infuses him with a calibrated presence that makes him stand out in an otherwise so-so film. Shelly Duval can't compete with the legend, nor can Scatman Crothers - they are both out-""shined"" by Jack in an almost forgettable way...in other words, its hard to even care for them because we're so busy trying to figure out what Jack'll do next. Scary through and through, though far from being a great adaptation of a Stephen King novel (see ""Shawshank Redemption"" for the best of the lot there), ""The Shining"" still works. Its a testament to the actor Nicholson more than anything else."
3,"Great book, incomplete movie","I love Stephen King's book, the Shining, so I wanted to see the movie. I found it startlingly imcomplete. I watched it with my parents, who hadn't read the book. They kept asking questions, and I understood that, because so many vital explanations were left out. Don't get me wrong- it creeped the hell out of me and some parts were even better than in the book, but it was just too incomplete for me personally. Pick up the book, if you want a true masterpiece in horror."
5,An Enduring Classic,"The Print is Beautifully restored, there are hardly any nicks or sctches, the are a few articating problems in the transfer, such as a few jaggies and glittering artifacts, but nothing too drastic, If you want you version of The Shining to be perfect, wait for the Supernit version to come out when ever :)"
2,Pass on this one. Go straight to the real one.,Pass this one up. Go straight to the newer one shown on TV a few years ago. Stephen King had total control over it and it does justice. It's the proper film to his book. It's long but very impacting. It creeps in slowly. But it seems as though it wasn't released on video like his other made for TV movies. Let's hope it is soon. I recorded it off TV back then and I desperately want an official release.
2,I would rather watch a movie that makes sence.,"This movie disapionted me. The novel is much scarier than this. The acting sucks and sometimes you will be wondering if Stanely Kubrick made the film without even looking at it. Tust me on this one, read the book, it's scarier than the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The only thing that scares you is the music."
2,The dullest [and most boring] horror movie I've ever seen.,"""The Shining"" is a film that I had high expectations for, and after seeing it, I was so disappointed. I had heard so much about how extraordinarily scary and terrifying it was. What I got was an extraordinarily dull, deadly, and hypnotic experience. The film is way too long and slow, relying on Stanley Kubrick's dull visuals and long shots to scare you. There were a few good things in it, like the two great actors Jack Nicholson and Scatman Crothers. But Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd are different stories. Duvall looks like a walking-dead skull, and Danny is mostly just a blank-faced zombie. What made me more angry was that I never really felt he was in danger. I was almost ready to slap him because of his dull presence. This is one time that I agree with Leonard Maltin on a movie. In his review, he said ""Some eerie scenes to be sure, but the film goes on forever."" And believe me, it does."
1,Ignore this release.,"Don't get me wrong, I love Stanley Kubrick's The Shining very much. It is my favorite adaptation of Stephen King's works. But this DVD just sucks. The Shinning was shot in full-screen, so this DVD is cropped. Also this DVD is missing over 20 minutes of footage. I repeat: Steer clear of this crappy DVD.Stick with the last release, because it does the film justice.P.S. The only one of these 5 new releases of Kubrick's films that is worth buying is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The rest are not worth buying."
1,UNBOX IS TERRIBLE!,"If you've ordered from Unbox before, maybe you've had better luck, but mine has apparently run out. I am missing the last 15-20 minutes of the film. I will NEVER download from Unbox again- the film is locked and can't be burned by most programs, the one that did for me produced an incompatible DVD. This service is piss poor, Amazon. I'm very disappointed."
1,How is this considered a classic?!,"I will keep this very short. The movie is about an hour too long. It seems like very little attention was placed into editing, with consideration of pacing. The long wait is not worth the weak payoff, and conclusion. It is a snorefest. Somehow Stanly Kubrick hypnotized many people into believing he was a good filmmaker. Full Metal Jacket is the only exception, because it is a really good movie. The only redeeming part of the Shining is Jack Nicholson, who played the psycho as good as could be done. If you have insomnia, buy, or rent this movie."
5,Chilling,"I challenge anyone to watch this film alone at night. The images (Grady girls, closeup of Danny's face in a silent scream) will set themselves in your mind forever. Nothing really violent here, just the steady presentation of one frightening image after another, until a nerve-wrecking conclusion. This film keeps you thinking desperately..""Oh God, what's going to happen next?"""
2,It was a great movie but was not scary enough for me.,The movie started off with a boring opening but it got better as it went on. I give it two stars because it was not scary enough for me. The storm of the century was much better.
2,The scariest thing here is the transfer,"This full-screen version looks like the print was dragged up the mountain behind a truck. It's shocking what a lousy job Warners did here. Avoid it at all costs. Supposedly the only decent DVD trasnfer in the Kubrick collection is 2001, and that's not done by Warners. The DVD is actually a repackaged MGM DVD. Hopefully Criterion will work on Kubrick's stuff and some point and give the public a product worth paying for."
3,fraud,"I consider it a fraud to advertise a movie using the same name as the original when parts of the original movie have been removed. Instead of being truthful the purchase turns into a game of how many minutes does it run. The purchaser is left to figure out exactly what scenes were deleted.In the original the cook is injured, but does not die. The cook and mother attend Danny's graduation. These scenes are omitted.I am buying a disc of the original to be sure that i am not delusional."
5,An excellent beginning guitar method!,The FastTrack Guitar Method Book 1 (Fast Track Music Instruction) is an excellent beginning guitar method!I use it with my students and have found most Students capable of doing very well by the time we get throughBook 1 & 2 as far as determining where they would like to continue their guitar playing careers.Michael Stephen Jackson.
4,Great travel product,"Great for traveling. Because of the neat design it is fun to carry in your luggage and because it does not have a plastic case I am not worried about it getting broken. It comes with plenty of colors of thread. The only thing is that it only came with 2 safety pins, but it had a little holder for them, so I just added a few more."
1,Employees point of view!,"Ok so I am an employee for Toys R Us and I am suposed to know a lot about the products that I am selling. It appears that I didn't know enough about the G Force when I baught it. I baught my first one and found that it didn't work at all. I believed it was just a bad controler. So I told my self that this can happen. So I got it traded in and brought my new one home. I found out that it only works with certain games. I now am going to try to talk to someone to get these products off the shelves because all it is doing is causeing people to waist there money. If I wanted to spend money on something like this, I would rather buy a giant piece of plastic because that is pretty much what it is"
5,GOOD MUSIC SANS ONE SONG!,"The soundtrack to the film ""Joshua"" is an album full of great songs by great artists. The only setback is Point Of Grace's rendition of the classic ""Wings of a Dove."" They took the great country gospel song and turned it into a bad R&B song. The rest of the songs are solid and uplifting. A great addition into the collection. Grade: A"
2,missing.....,i've read a few other reviews and i can't believe that they've failed to mention the biggest ommission !!!! the song over the closing credits is a gem and it appears to be nowhere on this album. the 'gem' in question is 'the fly' by dave matthews. watch the film again if you must - just to get to the closing credits and this beaut !!!!! you'll thank yourself over and over.
1,Don't waste your time or money-,"I had a hard time staying interested in this movie. If you can't get to sleep, here's your remedy."
2,A little feeling would have been nice.,"This was most disappointing since the songs seemed to be sung right off the lyric sheet with little or no emotion. The Canada cast version is really great, as is the Lincoln Center one.But this one, sadly, was sung without any feeling for the song or the characters."
1,Love the substance but not the form,"My criticism is of the publisher Northrop Frye, not the Blessed Newman. This book is an expensive Xerox copy of an old text. It has many imperfections including lost letters and spotty lettering and is hard to read. If I had known I never would have bought this version in the first place, it was not at all evident from the online page. In fact I plan to return it immediately. I'd advise paying a little more for an actual retyped reprint rather than a bound photocopy."
3,Intimate autobiography showing extreme religious devotion.,"John H. Newman wrote this autobiography in twenty-two days in response to a charge of lack of sincerity. It shows how fanatical he was, becoming physically sick when first he saw the tri-color of France, the symbol of regicide. He was equally fanatical about religion, starting the Oxford Movement with Keble and others in the 19th century. He eventually converted to the Roman Catholic Church. If you wish to examine the mind of a religious fanatic of the Roman Catholic Church, this is the book for you."
2,it broke at the begining,The handle broke off in the first few times we used it and it didn't want to stay down.I like the idea but qualtiy was poor.
3,Not all what I expected!,"The song is nice, but I almost can't see Mickey's face, or the toast gets too dark.It's nice if you just want a toaster. Not so good if you want to see Mickey Mouse."
2,TOO HOT TO THE TOUCH,"MICKEY MOUSE TOASTER. Have only used this toaster 3 times. Each time it is MUCH TOO HOT TO THE TOUCH. Not safe for an adult yet alone a child, which the toaster would certainly attract. The cuteness is much over-riden by the not safe exterior once a slice of toast is done. NOT SAFE. SO DISAPPOINTED."
2,"Cute gimic, but knob/lever is shoddy","I rather liked the Mickey image on my toast and hearing the happy music when they pop up --- what I don't like is that you have to finese the knob down just right to get it to engage. After loosing my temper on countless mornings, the lever bent easily and the knob popped off. I bent it back and am looking for a new toaster"
3,Good buy but the imprint doesn't work,I like this toaster but the imprint is not visible at all. It also plays music whenever the toast pops up.
1,not working,The toaster does not play the song when the toast pops up. I called Villaware and they said that they could not do anything about it. I left a message with Orangeonion and my call was not returned so I have a defective toaster for my great grand daughter. I was going to send it back but it would cost too muchAudrey Jane Fenton
2,Mickey mouse toaster,The music stopped working about 2 weeks after i had itwouldnt recommend purchasing it
2,Looks aren't everything,"IT looks cute and the music is fine, but the handle bent and it stopped toasting. Also, it DOES NOT toast evenly. Not worth the money."
5,Makes a great gift!,"My husband and I bought this toaster as a Christmas Gift for my dad. He eats toast morning, noon and night so we thought this would be a lot of fun. Turns out... he got an absolute kick out of the fact that it toasts a mickey mouse face into the bread. He says it actually does do a great job of toasting. The only down side.... you can't turn the volume up or down for the ""Mickey Mouse March"" and you can't turn it off. But it's so cute.. he loves it anyway!"
2,Short life span,I purchased 2 of these toasters made by Villaware in the past 1 1/2 years. Both quit playing the Mickey March within 5 months. Villaware no longer makes them so they can't be replaced even under warrenty.Joe
5,Who Wouldn't Love This??,"Breakfast with Mickey Mouse on your toast. I'm 37 years old, and love to hear the Mickey Mouse Club song when my toast is done. Great quality. A bakery sized bagel will fit, but not well. Needs help to pop up. Other than that, bread, english muffins and texas toast work awesome!!"
1,COMPANY WON'T STAND BY THERE PRODUCT,"VERY UNHAPPY THE SOUND WENT OUT AND THEY WON'T STAND BY THE PRODUCT AND SEND ME A NEW ONE, I WON'T PURCHASE FROM THEM ANY MORE.."
4,Love it!,"I love Adam's unique voice and style, my favorite tracks being Beautiful Song, 10,000 Miles, No Trace, Book of Endings, and I'm With You (beautiful lullabye!). I first experienced Adam's voice in Rent, and had to buy his CD. Highly recommended!"
5,Nice Listening,If you are a fan of Adam's you will definitely enjoy listening to this album. It's very original and the songs are catchy and memorable. I highly recommend buying it if you are looking for something new and different.
3,There are better options at better prices,"I bought this bib because the Bumkins brand was highly recommended by friends and I loved the cute prints. However, after using this bib for a couple of weeks, I now know there are other options out there. Here are my thoughts:Likes:- Good size for protecting my 5-month old son's clothing- The side velcro closure is very convenient and makes it easier to put this bib on and take it off of my squirmy little oneDislikes:- This bib is stiffer than I expected- The back of this bib has a plastic odor to it- I still smell traces of the avocado and green beans I fed my son even after a cycle in my washing machineI prefer the Especially for Baby/Koala Baby EZ Wipe bib that I purchased from Babies R Us for just $4.99. It's soft, flexible and easy to clean."
2,Not a great crumb catcher,"The bib is cute and waterproof, but the pocket to catch the crumbs lays flat and doesn't do a great job."
4,Great bib. Amazon has the lowest price!,"A friend of mine recommended this bib to me and I totally can see why. My daughter can't pull it off like she can some meal time bibs, it has a pocket to catch food, and it's machine washable. I love that it doesn't come apart from the plastic lining like the JJ Cole bib I bought did after putting it in the washer. Also, adorable prints can't hurt! ;) I have two (rasberry paisley and flutter) and plan on purchasing one or two more so even when a couple are in the dirty clothes or wash I have one on hand and one for the diaper bag. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c it could stand to be a bit longer. My daughter is one and it doesn't quite reach her lap...But all in all, it's great."
4,nice,"i like bumkins bibs, they clean easily, are not rough with baby skin and look fun too. although they loose form after months of use but hey, these are just bibs, not diamonds :) overall, these bibs are the best one can find on the market today, at such low price."
5,Best bibs!,"We love these bibs - they are all we use. They are water proof and the pocket catches the drips, drops, and blobs that occur at every meal. The various fun designs and washability are also a nice bonus."
4,Nice Bib,"wipes clean, not as easily as id like but gets the job done. no longer messes on my daughters clothes haha. i need to get more!"
1,CHEAP! thinner than your umbrella fabric!,"I bought this for a baby shower gift. But it's so thin and sad looking I don't know what to do with it! It's really light. I can see the food flying and dropping everywhere rather than staying on the bib as it's supposed to. I totally thought this would like the vinyl ones I got from Target previously. If you think I'm picky, just go to a store yourself. I later found this same kind at Target, Walmart, and Ross. I'll never buy this thing again. I'll shout out a few extra bucks to buy the vinyl ones, any day!"
4,For a 5 month old: good not great.,"I got these as my 5 month old started solids and a few things I don't like:He grabs and bunches the bib together so I often have to pull it out of his hand and lay it back down on his chest or I have to keep my hand on it so he can't grab at it. Also, the neck hole is a bit big for him (hopefully he'll grow into it) so the cereal that he spits out or drools out runs down his neck, chest, and clothes. I've tried to maket he velcro as ""tight"" as possible but it's still a bit big for him right now.Other than that, I love how easy it is to wash in the sink or washer and it dries quick b/c of the lightweight material. I'll definitely keep it around, but I think it's better for bigger/older babies."
5,Best Bib IN THE WORLD!,"Bumkins bibs are the best- I bought two for my first child when she was 6 months old. We alternate them at meal time. Two years later, they are still just as fabulous!! They catch almost every morsel dropped. We have a new baby so that means a couple new bibs. When they get really nasty, I throw them in the wash. They come out squeaky clean without compromising its original quality. Absolutely the best bib- nothing compares!"
3,no gold filter,"The product description explicitly mentioned a permanent gold filter, which was missing. A replacement coffeemaker was quickly shipped, also missing a gold filter. The coffeemaker is OK otherwise.Amazon's quick response was great. Mistakes happen; the speed of reaction is critical."
1,Worst item I've ever bought at Amazon,"I plugged in unit. Poured in water. 2 minutes later, coffeemaker started smoking. A nasty plastic smell too. Unplugged unit. Waited awhile. Plugged unit back in. Unit doesn't work now.This item pretty much reinforces the notion to NEVER BUY REFURBISHED ITEMS. In this case, refurbished means putting a non-working item back in nice packaging and letting someone one else mess with this. Now Amazon doesn't have a replacement.... so I have to start from scratch to find a new coffeemaker."
2,Great if you need a cheap coffee maker. . . well maybe,"I have to agree with the others that didn't think much of this unit. I just bought one of these for $19 and that's about what it's worth quality wise. No way anyone in their right mind would pay over a hundred dollars for this and I believe that's what the list price was before it went out of stock! I think this one is just going on the shelf as an emergency backup unit when my other brand-X fails because right now my Brand-X is a better unit then this one. Hopefully it won't smoke when I do need it, in fact I should just fire it up once to see if it does even work. The old adage ""You don't get something for nothing"" applies here."
2,Brews Too Fast... Flavorless Coffee,"I recently received this coffeemaker, anxiously awaiting a flavorful, quality cup of coffee befitting of the Cuisinart name. I made a pot. It was watery and flavorless. I figured I must have done something wrong. So I greatly increased the amount of Starbucks coffee I used in the filter. The result? Not much improvement. What appears to be the problem is that the machine brews super-fast, (much faster than my last one which made great coffee, but died) not allowing time for the coffee grounds to be fully saturated. The result is flavorless, weak coffee - and no way to extend the brew period.I got a great deal on this machine - but in this case you get what you pay for. Pass on this Cuisinart, unless you enjoy drinking diluted, weak coffee."
1,Worst Design Ever - Not Worth The Savings,"I ordered this thinking, how bad could a coffee-make be? LOUSY! I haven't made one cup yet, b/c one look at the layout and design made me realize I had to send it back. For years I've had a Krups Pro-Aroma, but the clock went out and then I broke the caraf and it was time to get something new. I've never appreciated my old machine so much.What stinks here? The lid on the caraf snaps into place, but the opening for water is so narrow you could never fill it properly by sticking it under the tap, so that means every time you want to use it you need to use two hands to take the lid off and fill the caraf. THEN when you want to pour the water into the machine, you have to lift the entire lid and pour it into this tiny chamber which is right next to where the grounds are.There's a reason it's on clearance - I bought it last week and it's gone down $6.00 since then. Save yourself the trouble."
4,One of Hip-Hop's Elite Films.,"Every Hip Hop head in the world should own this film for one reason alone: New York City Breakers vs. The Rocksteady Crew @ the Roxy. Classic! Rae Dawn Chong and the whole broadway portion of the film took some points away. But overall this is a great film for any hip hop purist. There's great cameos within the film as well, from Afrika Bambatta & The Soulsonic Force, Grand Master Mellie Mel, as well as The Treacherous 3. Wild Style & Style Wars are a tad bit better though, in terms of a more realistic portrayal of the culture."
5,Do that Shabadoo that you do so well.,"Breakin' was a great movie, however Breakin' 2 was not that ''electric''. lt was 0K and l understood why they made it, but it sort of tainted the cult following that the first one has. Still, there's no stoppin' the first one."
3,Hip Hop Roots,"Watch this movie to get an understanding of hip hop, graffiti, and rap culture, esp. as it was defined in New York City. Look fast, and you'll see future rap superstar Ice-T acting as an MC during one sceen."
1,Beat Street (Dvd),"Beat Street has great music, Great Breakin' , And Tagging, but it seems as one big cheesy musical do-good movie(with artsy/ballet music and a bunch of kids who should have better parenting) and of course what's with all the berets? of course Harry belanfonte(Mr. Fidel Lover) made the flick. other than being a Great **Hip Hop/Dance Flick** with Kool Herc!! and many others! It's worth watching.(Breakin' Is Better)"
4,very good and interesting movie,the movie held your interest and had a good storyline about the youth of america
3,Enjoy it ..... again......,"This is what I call a nice old school dance movie. I enjoyed it last when I was about 13 and it brought me so much joy then, that I decided to purchase it 2o years later - and I didn't regret it. This is what I call the ""good old days"". It might be that you have to be over 30 to understand though ;-)"
2,beat street,"Where do I start.. I ordered the film thinking it would be compatible for the uk and when it come throu the door I was so hyped up to watch it when I put it on and it didn't play on on my dvd playstation or pc I almost throu it out the window so I had to go to my sisters where she had to burn a copy to watch on pc coz it still wouldn't work on our dvds. Don't want to watch the film on pc when the Quality isNot very good I'd wish the people who sold this dvd to me had put on their site quoting it may not play in uk .. Coz if I knew that I would have saved my money coz the film wasn't all that anyway pony really if u ask meWasn't even the film I wanted, I wanted the film wi turbo were he breakdance's wi the broom..ne 1 know the name of that fim"
4,sneak peak at early hip hop culture,"This movie gives the new young generation a sneak peak into the early 80's hip hop culture....the place where breakdancers, dj's, tagging all began. where the movie lacks in acting it gains in breakdancing moves, battles, and music. a must see for any true hip hop fan!"
3,BEAT STREET,"This is the one, yes this is the greatest hip-hop movies of thecentury. I despise BREAKDANCE and ELECTRIC BOOGALOO because of thisBEAT STREET. The true hip-hop is in this movie. Yep, RAMO is great sodoes ROCK STEADY CREW,AFRIKA BAMBATAA and the godly GRANDMASTER MELLEMEL. Ray Dawn Chong has acted very well. The new rap(dare to callthemselve rap, hip-hop) shud learn from this originals before they cuta peice of... album. I totally recommended it. BTW what make me upsetabout this movie isthat.......................................... THEY'D NEVER RELEASE ITIN DVD FORMAT. Can someone let me know where I can get the DVDversion?"
3,old Movie,I bought this because it reminded me of home. I saw some areas I was familiar with. My children loved this movie so I collected it for my library so I could pass it on their kids. DVD was delivered in excellent condition
5,Great Gift,"I gave this to my boyfriend as a gift, really a just because gift. He absolutely loved it!"
5,Breakdancing at it's finest,"This is probably the best breakdancing movie that was made. It featured REAL breakdancing featuring the Rock steady crew and the NYC breakers, the two top groups. It also featured REAL hip hop artist and the Godfather of hip hop Africa Bambatta. The only disappointment was the graffitti art which was not represented purely, but the storyline about getting written over by some unknown artist was a real fact. And.....Oh yeah, forgot to mention my appearance as an extra in the Roxy scenes. Great to show friends and family, although there was no footage of me doing the electric boogie."
5,"MAN YA'LL BITERS, ALL YO HOMEBOYS ARE BITERS!","I agree with one of the previous comments about the movie plot itself not being all that great, but just to watch and reminisce with a time that can never be replaced. I wish they had behind the scenes on this DVD and some of the battles they had off the camera - that in itself would have been better than the movie ! But i read somewhere that the cameras were always turned off when they had battles during the filming of this movie (probably didn't want people to bite their moves). Anyways, I watched this movie at the theatres a half dozen times back in 83', and when it came out on VHS i was stoked. It's a shame that the west coast equivalent (Breakin' and esp. Breakin II) was made too hollywood, but I guess back then it was rare to be on a TV or movies so no one could complain. I am so proud that I was able to experience and participate in hip hop during that time era, when everything was just about fun."
3,Not the greatest movie...BUT,"As a movie in it's general sense, Beat Street is not a great film. It's just OK. It's real value is in its history, and being sort of a window to the past...when hip hop was about having fun, and using the art (and not guns) to settle beefs. I would suggest anyone thinking about getting this movie not be too concerned about plot and story, and just enjoy a time that's likely gone forever. I'm lucky to say that I lived through those times, and wish they could come back.I give the film three stars for story and plot. However, for history and just sitting back and reminiscing about a time long gone, I'll give it 5 stars.One final word: The Roxy battle scene is one of the greatest modern dance scenes ever committed to celluloid, and almost 20 years later, it still gives me chills."
1,Esperaba mas.....,"Al comprar esta pelicula, crei que iba a obtener una pelicula de la calidad de Breakin', pero no fue asi...el contexto de la pelicula dejo mucho que desear"
3,The grafitti was FAKE,"Okay, cheezy Hollywood storyline aside, this film contains truly classic footage of some of the best MCs, DJs and Breakers from this time period. The battle scene between the New York City Breakers and Rock Steady Crew alone makes this movie worth watching.But, for some unknown reason, there is no authentic graff art in this film. That's right, the pieces are all reproductions done by professional set painters.Get this movie for the music and dance scenes, but know that THE GRAFF IS NOT REAL."
1,bad product,"my wife purchase this product and told me that it took for ever to get to us, and the outside box that holds the dvd's was damaged scratches all over the dvd's which was not mentioned in the description of the product when we went to purchased this product. has to go out and spend more money to repair the scratches so it would work with out skipping. if i could i would have rated this product a ""0"" but i have to give it a 1 order to procede to the next screen."
5,Ultralight Preflight,"This DVD provides a detailed method for preflight inspection of an Ultralight. After looking at this DVD I was inspired to begin working on my Private pilot training. Remember this is a detailed inspection that is being performed and explained, I had no idea that a preflight inspection was sooo detailed. Excellent Product."
5,Just perfecr for babies!,"These scissors are wonderful for babies! They are more expensive than other ones but very safe and at the same time, sharp."
2,Defective item,I got these and really liked them the first few times I used them and then I noticed they became harder to use. I just realized today that every time they are opened the screw holding the two scissor halves together loosens a little bit. I tried tightening it and it still just kept loosening each time the scissors were used.
5,stranger than fiction,"Funny, entertaining, creative and thought-provoking are words that best describe ""Pulp Fiction."" The movie moves around in many different directions and there isn't a centric plot or theme. Instead it's like little plays woven together to form a work of art. I especially enjoyed Bruce Willis because he gave an exceptional performance that was both unique and meaningful. John Travolta was also a lot of fun to watch. The man is a true professional and always gives a wonderful performance in movies, but in ""Pulp Fiction"" he is even more fun to watch because he put so much life and energy into the role that he plays. If you try to follow the story you'll probably get lost, so don't. If you don't take things too seriously and don't mind mindless violence with a little bit of crude language thrown in for good measure than this movie is assuredly for you. This movie deserves to be on blu-ray."
4,It's Pulp Fiction. What more need be said?,"This is an excellent movie. The actors bring robust life to their roles and create memorable and quirky characters. The writing is original and innovative. The most impressive aspect of the film is how the director effectively breaks the usual convention (dating back to Aristotle's Poetics) of having a linear beginning, middle and end. Good stuff."
5,gift,an old movie that is still loved purchased it as a Christmas gift and was fun to give and have them receive
5,Great film,"Great film! tarantino has done it again. Not for small kids tho, my husband loves it, we keep buying this film on better and better medi"
3,reveting.......in a class of it's own,In PULP FICTION Jhon T. is leading the way in a new styly of acting . Roth as truely produced one of the greatst films of this century
4,Pulp Fiction,"Way strange, yet worth viewing. I had never seen this movie,""Pulp Fiction"" before. I wouldn't watch it again. But glad I did experience this movie once."
5,Some people don't get it,"Why does every numb nut believe that Pulp Fiction had to be told to you in chronigcal order for you to understand? You need to wake up, movies aren't ment to always be there for you to escape into fanasy land with as soon as you pay your ticket. It's there for those who enjoy a stimulating story whether it's an in your face joke or not."
4,Good Movie,"Pulp Fiction is an almost flawless movie that is one of the most interesting I have ever seen. Tarantino makes the story great by moving around from place and time througout the movie. This would make it hard to follow for anyone with an attention span of thirty seconds (which is a lot of people) but it makes it more interesting and fun to watch for me. The other factor that made it so good was all the pointless dialogue. This is some people's main complaint, but I believe it added humor to situations which are actually very serious. The only problem I had with it was all the racial slurs, which probably got Tarantino beat up at some point. So, watch this movie if you want something to think about."
2,Not all it was hyped to be,"First of all, let me state that I'm a huge fan of crime movies from Goodfellas to Menace II Society. And Quentin Tarantino has scored some major hits as a director, this being one of them (moneywise). And the actors here like Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta have all displayed more than a little talent. I felt this movie was grasping at something, as in Samuel L. Jackson's philosphical discussions, or the use of Biblical passages before murders. But it never really got a chance to develop. The car ride back after the first set of murders was a chance, but they blew it by having the guy in the backseat killed, etc., there was a lot of potential for development. Also, the Bruce Willis aspect was preety pointless, and the scene in the gun store was funny in a way, but still did not contribute. While attempting to connect the stories, and illustrate a certain point, Pulp Fiction does not suceed, and that is what hurts this movie."
1,UNACCEPTABLE PACKAGING - A RIP OFF,"First off, the film is 5 stars. The package it comes in however is an utter disappointment. Upon opening you will find a soundtrack cd which is barely held in by a cheap plastic molding. Not only that, but the soundtrack is nothing but an 18 minute ""sampler"", featuring only 6 songs! This is NOT the same soundtrack (2 cds) which was recently reissued to coincide with the dvd rerelease. There are no descriptions of the special features in the accompanying booklet; the tray which holds the 2 dvds (on a single spindle, making them susceptible to popping out loose and getting scratched) easily falls out of the box. For this set to retail for [...] is outrageous. You are far better off purchasing the Buena Vista edition. This is a slipshod production and is a complete abomination package-wise."
2,"McDonalds, the Finest Restaurant","As a beginning screenwriter, I am dismayed at the popularity of this movie and its four-and-a-half stars average rating on Amazon. Poor dialogue, little surface and less beneath.... But, as I have been reading most of the reviews here, I have come to the realiziation that most who like this movie would also claim that McDonalds is one of the finest restaurants one can find in whatever community they live in. The reviews of those who rate Pulp Fiction only a star or two consistently have their reviews rated as not helpful. And that is one of the poorest qualities of our society, and of Pulp fiction cultism: everyone likes to jump onto the bandwagon, without much thought (as went into this movie, beyond the cheap borrowings from others more creative), and then, again without thought, react negatively to those who don't agree. We tend to like that which is popular, even if it's not particulary good... until the bubble bursts."
1,very poorly written,This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen! I was totally confused as to what was going on and could not connect with that lifestyle or what the characters in the movie were trying to accomplish or what the point of the whole movie was. I can't believe this movie won awards!
1,What's the point?,"I know there are a lot of technical terms associated with a movie production like screenplay, direction, plot, acting, etc. Unfortunately I don't know the definitions of most of them. One thing that is pretty basic to me, though, is a ""point"". Usually there is some kind of point to a movie, good guy verses bad guy, she loves him, he loves her, may the force be with you, etc., but the point of this movie totally escapes me. It's THE most pointless movie I have ever seen. When it was done I felt like the trapeze artist who swung out to meet the person on the other trapeze and he wasn't there. I was also amazed that someone could make a movie where 90% of the dialogue consists of 4-letter words, the same 4-letter words. I know this movie has a following, but I'm not one of the followers."
5,I SAY GOD DAMMMMMNNN!,"EXCELLENT MOVIE!! One of Quentin's best all time! Great characters and movie lines as well!! Price was cheap compared to your local Target/Walmart store, and this is a classic must have added to your Blu-Ray collection."
5,Masterpiece,"Fast-food-loving hit man Vince Vega (John Travolta), his philosophical partner Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), a drug-addled gangster's moll (Uma Thurman) and a washed-up boxer (Bruce Willis) converge in this sprawling, comedic crime caper. Their adventures unfurl in three stories that ingeniously trip back and forth in time. Director and co-writer Quentin Tarantino uses whip-smart dialogue to propel the most audacious and imitated movie of the 1990s."
5,"No offense, but those of you who don't","""get"" Pulp Fiction probably need to stick to simpler films like Terminator or Batman. Violent, profane and a tiny bit flawed, yes, but still a masterpiece. Is Quentin a little disturbed? Of course! But he's still one artistic SOB who can weave all sorts of seemingly unrelated elements together to make one hell of an intriguing story. Quentin wasn't going for any great mystic message, folks; he was just telling a story that perhaps peeps behind the curtain of areas of life most of us never get to see or are even exposed to, that's all. A definiute cult classic, and very possible a future classic as well. Absolutely worth not only watching, but owning."
5,"It is funny to read reviews and see who doesn't ""get it""","I can't believe the reviews I read of this movie here at amazon. Everyone seems to either give it 5 stars, or else 1 star, depending on whether they ""get it"" I guess just as with a good joke, either you ""get it"" and it is funny, or else it goes over you head and therefore seems stupid, because you just didn't ""get it""! This is a GREAT movie, by the way, one of the best. Ignore what the un-enlightened say."
2,Blah...,"So many people said so much about this movie--it was evensupposed to be in the ""top 100 films"" according to AFI--so Isuppose I was expecting too much. Still, how can a movie be sooverrated by so many people? With the exception of Bruce Willis'scharacter I didn't care about any of the people in the film and it wasjust so, so obviously trying to be ""hip"" and""outrageous."" Trying too hard--it came off lame a lot of thetime. I wonder if the so-called appeal of this movie won't wear offthe more the years go by; it might end up being to the nineties whatmullet haircuts and skinny ties were to the eighties--""cool""at the time to certain types of rather unsophisticated people (theherd), but quite embarrassing later on in a ""what the ... were wethinking?"" kind of way. And, goodness, is this movie ever long!Rent before you buy. END"
5,A Must See!!!,"This is not a movie for the prissy right-wing pin-headed types. They will not GET it.They will complain about the violence and profanity. They will complain about the non-linear time line and the racial slurs. The viewer needs to be able to look beyond the these matters and enjoy what is an extremely well crafted movie.Teenagers will find this movie ""cool"", but won't know why, and [older folks] will find this movie highly offensive, strictly for the subject matter. Mature and intelligent viewers will understand what is going on and be utterly amazed.Just allow more than one viewing to let it all soak in..."
2,"Stylish as a fashion magazine, but just as forgettable","I'm no prude, but this was an extremely seedy film. Rape in a basement, a wrist-watch up a war veteran's anus, callow dialogue, and the N-word is strewn all over the place. Yep, this is real funny stuff folks. Absolutely heeeelarious! Yuk, yuk. Bets are on that Tarantino could never make a movie without handguns and racial epithets. He can't do it, folks. Check out Nicolas Roeg's ""Performance"" with Mick Jagger if you want a cool movie with substance to match style."
4,Prompt,This came within 3 days in the mail..very sufficient and the quality of the dvd was great as well. thank you soo much. Wouldnt mind buying again from this seller.
2,Not as good as I hoped,"So by seeing the previews, I thought this movie would be good. The story line absolutely sucked. I've been more entertained by Sponge Bob before."
1,Boring and without plot,"I recently had the misfortune of watching this movie. The start was disjoint and did not really follow. I put up with it hoping it gets better but it did not! Just stayed boring and lame. The violence does not make it any more interesting because without a plot there is nothing to add to. What a waste of a good couple of hours. I guess this is standard Hollywood. I am learning that if a movie gets lots of praise from Hollywood, then it is highly likely to be garbage."
4,Item on a Collector's Checklist.,The first time I tried to see this movie my mom found out I had it and she kept it in her 'dirty' stash that she pulls out when she and my dad want to make the beast with two backs. Anyways now there is a collector's edition of this movie and I got it for Christmas. I have to say it is a cool view and there are alot of special features for anyone interested in the making of or any other type of information you would like to see about the history and production of the film. The film in itself is great since the hype of it was so big when it came into theatres so if anything this movie is already know globally it's just if you are willing to see this classic for yourself and If you haven't seen this movie yet and you are atleast 17 years of age then I suggest you watch this movie. It's a classic and a must have for any movie collector out on this grey and brown earth!
3,good movie in worst dvd transfer,set aside it's content... dvd transfer was the worst among my 100+ dvd colletion.. over contrast make everyone's eye tearful. I demand release!
2,"Overlong, overstuffed, overrated","Each passing year emphasizes what a gimmicky, overblown, ultimately empty mess ""Pulp Fiction"" is, especially as it becomes clearer what a one-trick pony its director is.The handful of strong, funny, provocative scenes in the film are undone by others that seem to go on for days. The Travolta-Thurman sequence seems especially forced and tedious now, and the set-up of the Bruce Willis-Ving Rhames showdown is shamefully flabby. And the closing diner sequence is beyond anticlimactic.Tarantino seems so determined to display his own prodigious cleverness that he refuses to impose any economy on the story or how it's told. As a result, what might have been a fast-paced, dizzying thrill ride with some judicious editing is instead a leaden, 160-minute valentine from Quentin Tarantino to his own perceived genius."
4,It's Pulp Fiction!,Say no more! It is the quirky classic that put Tarantino on the map! Hard to follow the first time around. Tarantino loves to mess with your head.
3,Chapters on Suffle Mode,"Since this was the first time I ever saw a non-sequential movie like this it was exciting for me to try to make sense of what was exactly going on and when it was exactly going on. It also helped me to see the story the way real life events happen, by happening with no seemingly connection to one another but upon closer inspection everything is connected.However, I'm not sure that's exactly what was intended but that's what I walked out with.Another thing that shocked me about the movie was the callousness of the characters. It made me almost disgusted on how their are real people out there who have such little value for anything except money and power.There's not much else to say on this film since the story line isn't really that interesting and the characters are fairly one dimensional. Certainly worth watching one or two times but I wouldn't call it a classic."
3,Enertaining but way over rated,It's unfortunate that Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Luc Godard can't sue Little Quinton for trivializing their work but so be.This film has it's moments and has some snappy dialogue but there is absolutely nothing original in it.
3,WTF?,Can someone explain to me why this costs so much? The product description is in no way descriptive. It's the same fill-in-the-blanks description as an other moview with no justification for the ridiculous cost.
3,Entertaining but overrated,"OK. You probably have already seen this movie and have an opinion of it.I had not seen it for several years after it came out on theatres. I was looking forward to it because it was very hyped. I was not that impressed. I think it is entertaining, but certainly not the greatest movie ever.Oh, and I do like some of Tarantino's work (like Kill Bill)"
1,What's so special about that movie?,I can't figure out why people love this movie. It was so boring. It's the first time I watch a movie with amazing ratings and so boring.
2,You got to be kidding me!,"I watched this movie in 2005 (I never saw it before) and the reason I finally did see it is because most people I know told me how great it is. Well, I can confidently say that this movie is nearly a piece of wasted film. Aside the over the top bad language used (more than needed) what this movie really seems to do is to numb your mind to the extent that killing other people is just a cool thing to do. As far as deep meaning or constructive message to the public there are none. Also the beginning and end of the movie are looped togheter, however the overall plot development feels like reading only the middle chapters of a book with no true direction. The idea that this movie is liked by so many clearly shows the direction that society seems to have taken. Overall: PURE GARBAGE."
1,Wrong Picture,i bought this product because it was supposedly an special edition with a box and all it is is a regular common DVD. I really want to sue Amazon just for selling this product with that picture.
4,big flaw,"It is a good film, but one major flaw. For example: in one of the film's most violent scenes, John Travolta turns around to ask the black guy about the ""angel"" who saved him and Jackson. His gun accidentally goes off, the windshield gets covered in blood, and, well, though you'd be afraid to admit it, it's funny. But, to the flaw, Travolta seems to lose his evilness for that second, seems to get over exited, and acts more like a little kid then someone who just committed MURDER. I doubt that Tarantino wanted him to act that exited before the big splatter, and his presense practically ruins the whole scene, which could be the best of the movie. I give it four out of five anyway."
1,Certainly one of the worse movies of a decade,"I can't believe anybody would give rave reviews for this junk. The acting was horrible, the dialogue was stupid and the movie indulged in senseless violence and drug themes. Hey, let's bring the redlight district into our living room. It is hypocritical that the movie lampoons socalled white racists as ferries while the same directors and producers endorse the ""rights"" of ferries. Quentin Tarantino must eat a lot of junk food to look like that. He certainly spews out junk when he directs a movie. The pulps I'm familiar with were well written. Writers like Maxwell Grant (aka Gibson) or H. P. Lovecraft or R. E. Howard would role over in their grave to know that the modern spin on pulp fiction has been reduced to this."
1,really cool trash...,"Congratulations Hollywood! You've finally made a film that makes killing people really sexy. Dull characters, senseless plot. Hollywood, how do you do it???"
5,An absolute favorite!,"This is a fun, wild ride! Violent and not for children but full of perfect filmaking moments. Great performances all around but especially from Samuel L Jackson. I only own 3 films and this is one of them."
5,my favorite movie of all time!!!!!,"this is tarintino's best. i love how the end just falls into place.travolta,jackson,thurman,willis,and kietel give excellent preformances."
5,There is nothing better,"This movie is the best film that was ever made. I'm talking about all aspects of this movie. The acting is superb, ranging from the John Travolta to Steve Beusemi. This is the most terrific screenplay, with intriguing dialouge, twisting plot, and hidden innuendos. Quentin Tarentino is an absolute ""Mastermind"" when it comes to directing and screenplay. It is no wonder why it won an oscar for best screenplay and all the main actors got nominated. If your looking for the greatest work in the movie business, pick this movie up right away. It has dark comedy, interesting characters, great plots, and magnificent directing. The negative reviewers can't help it to give it bad reviews, they can't help it that they are not smart enough to understand the movie."
4,I expected more,"The movie was actually pretty good but i expected more from the reviews i had heard. It had an all star cast that included John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, and Quentin Tarantino himself. I thought that the dialogue for the movie was outstanding. But there was no need for as much drug use as they showed. Ok, show Mia snorting once, we understand that shes an addict, they dont have to show it 3 times. But overall the movie was pretty good, and you should see it but leave the kids with the babysitter."
3,Import version,"This movie is being released on Blu-ray in the U.S. in 2009, so it might be best to wait. If you can't wait, this import version isn't bad. I'd knock off a couple of stars from the video because there is noticeable DNR (digital noise reduction) and edge enhancement, but it still looks considerably better than the DVD. The U.S. release will look similar to this disc unless Disney creates a new master. Note: This is an import, but it will play in U.S. machines."
2,Not a fan,"There was a smattering of funny parts in this movie, but I find Quentin Tarantino to be a horrible director."
3,"So real, you could talk with your friends and is the movie","This movie is all hype, as original as having three stories and how they end up interacting with one another, even parodies of the movie are better than it. I love all of the actors, Bruce Willis as a boxer running from a man he was paid to throw a fright, John Travolta, and Samuel Jackson with his overacting both are hit men, sent to kill Willis. This movie is so realistic that rather than watch it, a person could live it, having a normal conversation or dancing with someone's girlfriend like Travolta and Uma. It does have its funny moments with in your face humor, but otherwise there are four parts of a legitimate movie rather than you talking with your friends. There are also a few cameos, one of which is Christopher Walken who has a comical 5 minutes telling an 8 year old boy how a watch was smuggled safely so Walken could give it to the boy. If you are looking for a DVD with features, there is nothing but the movie."
5,most original film of the 90s,i have never seen any film quite like this one. the best part of the movie is its refreshing uniqueness in that plot lines flow through sub plotlines and everything works together in a seinfeld-esque blunder of unforeseen coincidences and irony. i would have ventured this as a contender for the number one movie of the nineties.a definate one for your home collection.
2,Not the movie but it's the DVD set that i received....,The movie is one of my favourites. But i'm shocked and disappointed that the 2-DVD Collector's edition set that i ordered from Amazon came to me without the BOOKLET inside it !!! I checked the other customers' image of the set in here and yes!!! there is definitely a booklet in it. I mean it's ok that the DVDs are in good condition (playable n not scratched or other defects whatsoever) but my set seems to be incomplete without that nice booklet in it which i'm sure must contain some nice infos and descriptions on the movie but now i wouldn't know it right? Can i ask Amazon to just send me the booklet for free?
5,What a movie!,The dialogues are excellent and the story is inspired. This is whithout a doubt a great flick.
5,Extraordinary,"""Pulp Fiction"" made me want to become a director. This is still Tarantino's best, but all his movies are amazing."
1,Lasting Impression for what?,"I saw this movie once, and have never wanted to see it again. I can see why some might like it because it definitely will leave an impression on you but for what purpose? I didn't like the impression it left on me and you might not either, so rent it before you buy. If you did like it because of the violence etc, then be sure and check out Scarface with Al Pacino for a movie depicting drug use, graphic violence and foul language in excess quantities. I actually liked that movie."
1,They couldn't even get the product right,Im really upset cause I specifically ordered this edition (th black slipcase 2 disc one) and instead I ended up with the French Canadian edition (That I did not order)
1,Some things shouldn't be recycled.,"It would be easy to spend my 1,000 word alotment on moral ground, but a larger problem with this ""orginal"" film is its unoriginality. Quentin borrows much of the film ideas from other films he must have watched countless times while working at video a store. It disgusted me the first time with crude and often dump jokes, many things thrown in just to be thrown in like gay rape, drug use, and a near overdoes of violence. In fact, if you took all this out of the movie, it would be a blank tape. I would prefer the blank tape. I strongly urge anyone who hasn't seen this tape, especially people easily offended to not watch this video."
5,BEST PICTURE EVER!!,"This is, without a doubt, my favorite movie ever, and this is also my favorite DVD ever, even tought Tarantino didn't record a Commentary track for this DVD, the Enhanced Trivia Track makes up for this (even tought most of the info in the trivia can be found in www.imdb.com) It has a lot of interviews and shows related to the movie, it has a few deleted scenes, a great transfer both in audio and video... and heck... it's PULP FICTION, if you don't buy this I don't know why you've read this far."
1,No Stars for this DVD,The Pulp Fiction BluRay that was sent to me was a dud. I need to send it back to Amazon.com as soon as possible. I attempted to play the disc in all 3 of my updated BluRay players and all 3 ejected the disc. I was very disappointed to say the least.
4,Great approach,"Quentin Tarantino did real wel with Pulp Fiction.Along with the unique story telling, he took the risk of a non-linear approach, which I'm sure made it very interesting for its time.The whole cast was excellent. And the music was fantastic.Mostly, it was the approach in making this movie. Hats off."
3,Want to see another one,"Why doesn't Quentin Tarantino do another one like this? I like this one, but I feel he's got another one that could even go further.I liked the direction. I liked all of the actors. And I liked the music.I hope he does a sequel!"
4,One of the best movies ever made,"Pulp fiction is not just a movie, its a cinema experience that should not be missed. Tarantino is great at what he does and know one should bug on him.The casts were greatthe story is perfect and jon travolta is superb in the film.Its one of the top 10 for me. Get this movie on DVDYou won't be dissapointed.Later"
5,great movie bar-none,This film is great because up to then some film studios seemed to be making films based on the same formula.The fact that so many other films have obviously ripped off many ideas from this film speaks volumes about how great it is.
3,Bom!,O filme é ótimo e cheio de extras. Mas tem um detalhe: esta verso é a Award-Winning Collection e no Two-Disc Collectors Edition. Ateno na hora de comprar!!!
3,Was okish... not as big as hype...,"Maybe it is that I just dont like Quintent Teritino... wow... I cant spell his name.It wasnt bad though... if it wasnt for all the hype my friends made of it, I might have loved it...there were like, 4 or 5 scenes that were totally awesome, but then there were alot of boring or just stupid parts.Worth a watch to see all the hype, and for the several awesome scenes... but be careful when you fast-forward... some of the good scenes sneak up on you... and are dialouge..."
5,storing dead niggers aint any of my fu@#ing buisness,"this is one of my favorite movies of all time. its brilliant. Quentin Tarantino is my all time favorite director and even though i love his other films this is his best.John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving rhames(who is ass F#$%ed in the film), Harvey keitel, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer all give outstanding performances in(my opinion)one of the best films ever made. Even though it one an oscar for best original screenplay i think it should of won all 7 or 8 it was nominated for.though im not entirelysure what they are it should have won them all.E ven Quentin Tarantino make a great cameo as a man who doesnt like to store dead niggers(or anyone dead for that matter)overall great movie, recomend highly."
5,great movie,it is a movie of the realitys of crime and life. it is a break through on film makeing. it is a work of art. a must see if not buy.
1,Awful ...,"Insipid, overhyped and offensive. This film glamorized violence to an excess. Too many racial slurs for my liking. And, don't forget ... BORING."
2,over-rated,"This is the most over-rated movie of the 90's. For some reason it hit a zeitgeist of the time. Only about a half hour of the movie total is good. The rest is tedious, contrived """". I guarantee, GUARANTEE, that Quetin Tarentino will never be involved in a film that takes in over $100 million again. It was dumb luck that PULP FICTION caught on like it did. If you want to see a great L.A. film noir movie, see MEMENTO."
2,I don&#65533;t get what is so great about this movie,"Ok, Pulp Fiction was interesting and original. But I just don't get what is so great about this movie. People have said that this is the best movie of the 90's. Can someone please explain to me how so? What am I missing?This movie is made out to be A+, I see it as B- at best."
1,one star is way too many,"complete waste of time.boring,nonsense.i want the hour and a half back of my life.one of the only movies i stopped watching part way through.garbage.i was so pissed off when i stopped watching it i had to share my anger to warn others."
2,Colorful but strictly for the boors,"There's not one whiff of originality, wit or intellgence in this mindless exercise in condescension & self-indulgence. Definitely the work of someone who worked in a video shop for far too long."
1,Pulp Trash,I do NOT understand why so many folks think this is such a good project. If you enjoy a film where practically every other word is a swear word then here's your film. If you enjoy watching people shoot heroin in their bodies then get this film. If you enjoy watching senseless violence then be sure to get this. Pulp Garbage would have been a better title.
1,2 hours wasted,"I saw this in a theater the weekend it came out. I still vividly remember it as two hours of my life i would like to have back. Interesting story structure and surface sizzle, but mostly nauseating sadism and ""life is cheap"" thrills. The heroin needle scene made me sick and the Harvey Keitel sequence depressed the heck outta me(...).I liked Rodriguez' DESPERADO, but this sleaze-chic satire was a turn-off."
1,dud,after receiving this dvd i tried to play it and discovered that it was the wrong area code so rather than sending it back i gave it to a friend of mine who can copy any area code into australian format so it can be watched. he called me to advise me that the dvd i was sent is completely blank with nothing on it i will never purchase a dvd or similar product from here again
3,Classic that outlived its days.,"Brilliant and innovative at the time when it was first released, I can only compare watching this film today with watching a car wreck. Fascinating, it leaves you feeling empty. I don't mind senseless violence in the movies (one of my favorites is Romper-Stomper) but this movie is heartless and pointless. I give it three stars only for the ground braking role it played in the film making history."
5,thee version to own,if u love pulp fiction(who doesnt) get this version the picture and sound are amazing and u get so much bonus material i cant even begin buy today
2,Wildly Overrated,"The most overrated movie of the last ten years. It is way way way way way too in love with its own cleverness. Occasional bits of brilliance (in particular Samuel Jackson's performance), but nothing to justify all the hype. It has absolutely nothing to say. There is nothing in this movie that has not been done before, and better, by other directors who have a vaguely adult sensibility. Tarantino is trapped in his own sophmoric universe, giggling at how cool he thinks he is. It is a Royale With Cheese, which is to say ""Same S###, Different Name."""
4,Great Movie,"Terintino is an Excellent film maker, and Samual Jackson is excelent as the assasin that turns over a new leaf."
5,Iconic American cinema,"What can you say about a movie that has had people talking for almost 2 decades? It's like writing a review of the bible.You either love it or hate it. I love it. (Pulp Fiction, not the bible)This is my 3rd copy. I think it's safe to say I will always have a copy in my library."
5,You want to watch a great movie?,"With a cast of John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, it would be hard to beat this movie in any shape or form. All you really have to do is see that Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it, and you would know it was a winner. No doubt, the director did put in some risks by putting the scenes in non-chronological order, but if you have a good memory, you will have no problem with this movie. This movie doesn't really have a plot, but each scene ties with another. If you like the Kill Bill series, you will definitely love this movie."
5,Canadian edition has extra features that this doesn't,"A lot of people have been complaining about the lack of extras on Pulp Fiction. I had the same problem. However, I discovered that another company distributes this flick in Canada and has released a different version of the DVD. The Canadian version has deleted scenes with introductions to each by Tarantino. It also has the trailers for the film from 5 or 6 different countries to compare the way the film was marketed internationally. The transfer is the same, so there is no loss to picture and sound on the Canadian edition. Also, the Canadian edition is Region 1, so it'll play on any DVD player in the U.S. Finally, you can find this rather easily on the Net, and it will be a few dollars cheaper than the American edition after you take the currency exchange rate into account. Anyway, to those who are upset with the American version's lack of extras, there is a better alternative at a cheaper price."
4,Fun!,"Typical Trantino: violent, interesting characters, messes with your sense of time and place and overall very entertaining.This is the ONLY movie I ever paid to see in theaters THREE times.Great performances, interesting story, and an awesome soundtrack, too."
5,Classic,great movie. ive probably watched it a thousand times and it never gets old. and its at a great price.
5,Classic Tarantino,"Pulp Fiction is a classic for all Tarantino fans. All star cast with great performances. I typically don't purchase blu rays for items that I already have on dvd, but at the $3.99 price, it is a must have for the collection."
4,Fantastic Blu-Ray Transfer,"The transfer to hi-definition looks amazing on this Pulp Fiction Blu-Ray. Wish that the extra features were in HD. Instead, they look like a transfer from VHS. Still - for the price alone, this is a ""must get"" for any fan of the film. You can see the pores on the skins of the actor's faces. Shipping was really fast and I have no regrets regarding my purchase."
5,Great Audio/Video on this Blu-Ray Import,"I ordered the Danish Import of the Pulp Fiction Blu-Ray and I was not disappointed. Played fine on my USA Blu-Ray Player. I would give the audio and video a 9 out of 10. Very satisfied! And by the way, Miramax just went out of business so this will NOT be released in the USA anytime soon."
5,"Awesome, everything about it.",Yes a bit strange but I loved this movie! My boyfriend and my mom recommended Pulp Fiction to me and now I recommend it to you! I loved how it all fit together but was in like 5 different chapters.
2,Pros and Cons,"Wonderful Storytelling, EXCELLENT acting by Samuel L. Jackson, Memorable Lines... too bad they had to waste all this talent on a prurient, disgusting storyline."
2,dissappointed,"The disk was clean, playable, and unscratched. But the case was a clear plastic generic with a photocopied cover. It does not even have a label on the binding. Not at all what is being pictured."
5,A Genuine American classic,"Pulp Fiction is no doubt the best movie of the 1990s with a excellent cast,brilliant writing, and superb direction. The plot is mainly three stories in one movie with two hitmen killing two guys in the beginning and then taking a suitcase,a boxer killing an opponent and gets in a real problem after getting back his watch,and then has the two hitmen talking to robbers in the restaurant.Each tale is well-written with some messages in them like the suitcase's combination being 666,the bandage on Marsellus'neck,the word Grace being on the gastank on Zed's chopper,the clocks reading 4:20 on the pawnshop wall in the basement when Butch is walking down the stairs,and why the suitcase had a weird gold glowing light when they open it.If your a fan of drama and like black-humor this movie is perfect. The violence is mostly off-screen and shown very little.PF ties with Clerks for being the best movie of 1994 and the whole 90s decade.If it wasn't for this movie the 90s would stink."
5,THE BEST FILM OF ALL TIME!!!!,"I have seen this movie at least a hundred times, and I never get sick of it. Tarantino is amazing. Should of won best picture over that ignorant Forrest Gump!"
2,A cheap rip-off,"Tarantino's only accomplishment is that he steals most of the techniques from much better Hong Kong directors and inserts some of his unique dialogue. Hence, it is only the dialogue in this movie that is commandable. Otherwise, it's terrible. If you like maverick filmmaking, see anything by Jean-Luc Godard, Wong Kar-Wai or Ringo Lam. Skip this one."
1,"Pretentious, Offensive Piece of Junk","PULP FICTION has to be one of the most disgusting and overrated film of this decade. Pretentious camera angles and dialogue, mangled pacing and another bad performance by the tremendously under-talented Bruce Willis made this film difficult for me to watch. As for the use of the ""N"" word, I wonder what Tarantino would do if Spike Lee made a movie where Italians were called nasty names, and I think there are plenty. You don't get to use the word sir - you ain't a member of the club. His subsequent efforts may not have been as lurid, but are equally as bad."
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,"This has to be one of the most overrated films in history. I believe that most people who said that they liked this piece of garbage only did so because they wanted to sound hip and cool. Many did not see Tarintino's previous films but were told how hip and cool these films were and so by the time Pulp Fiction was released they went to see it so that they could ""jump on the bandwagon"". Tarintino is trying to make mindless violence ""trendy"". There is no real plot to this picture and the characters are all obnoxious. It seems that for a film to be considered a masterpiece nowadays, it must contain weird situations and violent obnoxious characters. Because this film was so popular it is a sad commentary of the times we live in."
1,Horrid.,"A pointless mess of a film. There's nothing really more I can say. I try to write in-depth reviews, but I just hated this movie."
2,So what?...,"I must have missed something because I found this movie pointless and boring. There is nothing likeable about any of these characters and there is no redeeming quality about any of them either. At no point in the movie are you given a reason to care whether or not any of these characters die. At no point does the movie reveal any aspect of the human condition. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the cast and some of the dialogue. There is even some good acting (but don't look to Uma Therman for it). At the end of the movie I was left with a profound feeling of...""So what?"""
1,can't expect such a lousy movie from such a great cast.,I have heard alot about this movie from my friends but when I actually saw this movie I realized this was the worst movie I have ever watched in a long time. At least you can't expect such a lousy movie from such a great cast.
5,Classic!,"I love this movie, it's hilarious! But it's also a thinker, and it has a lot of drug activity in it. A great pick for a Tarantino movie night if you're the kind of person who does those sorts of things..."
5,Pulp Fiction,"AWESOME MOVIE!!! It is graphic, but has excellent acting, script, cinematography, everything!! You can't go wrong with Quentin Tarrentino, Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta, and Bruce Willis!"
3,It's a good movie but my blue ray won't play it,I'm working on getting that fixed; Pioneer tells me I need to upload some new upgrades and that might make it work
4,great movie - diapointing DVD,"This is not a movie review - it is a great movie and one of my favorites but there are other web pages for good movie reviews. The DVD was disappointing. Almost no extras whatsoever. It was basically the movie divided into chapters. The sound quality was good , but could have been better - especially given the great soundtrack. The picture quality is great but in widescreen format so you need a big screen TV to really get the full benefit off this. The DVD did not allow the viewer to specify the viewing format. Oddly enough the Canadian version of this DVD(same encoding as USA- region 1) has some extras. This version has a few deleted scenes, each one introduced by Quentin Tarantino. there are also trailers from different countries. Fans of the movie who want to add it to their collection would be better off with this - you may find it at an auction site. It gets 4 stars for being a great movie. if this was not such good movie this DVD would only get 3 stars."
5,More art than entertainment,"""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those films that is meant to be as much an expression by its artist (Quentin Tarantino) as it is for entertainment. What makes this film unique and not BAD (as some people label its unorthodox methods) is that it doesn't have to be in perfect chronological order and doesn't have to waste yards and yards of film on scenes that explain the story in monotonous detail. It features superb acting, and the character development is so wonderful that we find ourselves CARING about drug-addicted, gun-wielding henchmen. This film is best viewed when one can throw their film prejudice aside and take the movie for what it is: a classic."
4,A classic....,"This film is a classic. You must have it in your own. Very good quality, picture and sound. Highly Recomendable."
4,TOTALLY REEKING OF SUCKINESS,"This is a well directed film, Quentin Terrantino is a quire in a half and makes me heave on my shoes"
5,A Great Movie,"All of the cast delivered excellent performances including many big actors today like John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and Samuel Jackson.The movie itself is very funny, but you have to have a good sense of humor because it is usually about serious subject matter such as death, drugs, and murder, etc. (These are criminals!) Anyway it has a messed up chronology where the beginning isnt really the beggining and the end isn't really the end, and all though it is tough to follow at first it'll keep your attention and if you dont get it still, you can watch it again. Definitly worth the bucks, this one comes highly recommended, although I might wait for the special edition to come out because it has more special features :)"
2,"Nostalgic, but boring","This film has not aged well. When it debuted it was something new and fresh. The humor was dark and edgy, but watching anew is frankly boring. If you loved this movie but don't currently own it, it is a must for a collector. New viewers should also check this out for posterity but if you've seen it and didn't LOVE it, it is not worth revisiting."
1,not the movie the stupid bare bones dvd,"First off this is a masterpeice of film and argubaly the best movie to come out in the 90's. so why a one star reveiw we need a vista series or critrion vesrion if ever a movie would benefiet from this treatment this is it and why is it not happening. Simple, because people are still buying this over priced dvd i saw it at blockbuster from 27 bucks and laughed that somebody might actaully pay that for something that is got nothing but the movie, I will keep my orgianal vhs copy untill a deccent edtion hits the streets it will hopefully happen one day"
3,Brilliant and heartless.,"Brilliant and innovative at the time when it was first released, I can only compare watching this film today with watching a car wreck. Fascinating, it leaves you feeling empty. Now, I know that a lot of people will rip me off for this review, but the world has changed since 1994 and this is how I feel in 2002. I don't mind senseless violence in the movies (one of my favorites is Romper-Stomper) but this movie is heartless and pointless. I give it three stars only for the ground braking role it played in the film making history."
2,What is this movie about ?,"The fascinating thing about all the adulation this movie receives, and its endless comparisons to great movies of the past, is that none of the critics / reviewers ever talk about the meaning of the movie! We hear about the re-emergence of John Travolta as a sleeping giant of an actor, the remarkable performance of Samuel Jackson, and what can only be described as borderline idolatry for Quentin Tarantino etc.. We hear about all the extras (interviews, behind the scenes stuff etc.) that appear on the DVD and then there's the sound track, but no one ever bothers to convey to us what the movie meant to them!What, if anything, is the message here? I have been watching movies, foreign films included, for forty years and I wouldn't add this DVD to my library if you gave it to me for free.I can only say that when some call this a 'great' movie, I have absolutely no idea what they mean."
3,Violent & Daring,"I'm not really sure why I saw this movie but after seeing it, I have to say that this is packed with LOTS of VIOLENCE. It was a great movie, but I guess I wasn't prepared for PULP FICTION. It went so far out my boundaries that for almost half of the movie I was covering my eyes! I'm a big fan of action and vignette movies. Thought the 'action' was WAY too intense.NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.After the brutal scenes of violence I was left thinking if I should laugh or be shocked at the way the sequence was shown. The scene that came to my mind immediately (and one of my favorites) was when Samuel Jackson and John Travolta was in the car driving with a man on the backseat. WOW!! I'm sure the people who saw PULP FICTION know what part I'm talking about.I guess the strong performances of the cast made it possible to make this movie what it is A VERY DARK ACTION/DRAMA/COMEDY"
5,A perfect cast... A perfect Movie!,"Wheather you love this film or loath it, you will never forget your first veiwing of it. It left one hell of an Impression on me. Bruce Willis has always been my favourite Actor, (check my member page) and this film just made me love him more. John and Samuel were better than ever, Uma was also brilliant. Lets face it.. Everyone in the cast deserved an Academy Award. The 3 storys weve together brilliantly and the pace suits the movie perfectly. If you haven't seen it, for the love of god, please do."
1,The best scenes have been cut.,I saw this in Canada a few years ago and I didnt know that there was an edited version.This version is so lame.The shooting in the car and cleaning up the mess has been cut. I havent watched the rest. I'm so disappointed. This is the Walt Disney version of Pulp Fiction. I really hope I can get my money back so I can buy the full version of this movie.Dont buy this unless its for your kids.Neil Birch
5,one of the best films ever made!,"truthfully, i don't really think i need to write this review, because almost everyone i have ever met has seen this movie and loved it. for those of you that have been under a rock for the past ten years, this is an amazing movie that should definitely grace your dvd collection. nobody does 'em quite like tarantino!"
2,"Buy the soundtrack, forget the movie","The only thing good that came out of this movie was its soundtrack. I noticed some ""older"" people wrote bad reviews for this movie, but bad reviews for this movie transcend age. Whether you are in your early 20's (like me) or late 50's... it's a bad movie. Those without a life may live vivaciously through this movie, but those with taste would watch something else."
2,BLAH!!,"I can't believe all these people think that Quentin Tarantino is some kind of genius. You'd have to be a retard to like have the crap he puts out on film, and trust me, there are a lot of retards out there. This movie gets 2 stars for only 1 reason, Samuel L. Jackson. And NO, this isn't his best movie either. And it really shouldn't get even 2 stars, because I can't STAND John Travolta! Now, if this IS your idea of a classic genius work, I hate to discourage anyone, but you have been PLAYED, and you've spent your $$ on no real talent! Hear that? NO TALENT!!! N-O T-A-L-E-N-T !-!-! My favorite Tarantino movie out there is Jackie Brown, because it has to be one of the best player movies out there... AND I HATED IT TOO!!! At least I was able to put one of my trusty barfbags to use. Ha ha ha! Have a nice day.Thank you."
1,movies i wish i never saw,"how did such a horrible movie get such high reviews ?? another sick flick labeled black comedy or something like that with no redeeming value, a terrible plot and really dumb ending. they call this entertainment ??"
3,good film,"why no spanish subtitle for the special feature, fantastic movie one of my favorites ever...thanks for good images and sound"
4,Boring Bruce Willis plot keeps this very good movie away from 5 star greatness,"The title pretty much says it all. Tarantino on his best day is a very good director, but not quite a great one. This is as close as he comes to greatness, but poorly written scenes for the Bruce Willis character plot keep him from it. Even with that, it's still a very good movie, and one of the few Tarantino movies that actually deserved most of the critical praise that it got. I still think it would have worked better on stage than on film, but still good all the same."
3,Fiction for sure!,"This movie relied on promiscuous foul language and violence, and not a very plausible story line to go with that. Flash-backs were not always easy to follow."
4,Unique thriller/drama,"First 45 minutes are painfully slow plot setup. I admit I fell asleep the first two times I tried watching, but I kept hearing how good the movie is. Third time I tried, I got to the middle- then bam it takes off. Then you can't walk away until it's over. Recommended, but beware of the beginning."
5,Pulp Fiction: defining movie of my life (not really),"I have never had a movie with so much action, comedy, and genuine storytelling. There is just so many quoteable parts in the movie, and so many amazing parts, that i can't even begin to put it down on paper. This is a must buy, on vhs or dvd"
3,One of the most overrated films ever,"Pulp Fiction LOOKS and SOUNDS great, but its heart and soul are empty. All form, no substance. This is much ado about nothing. However, I can't deny that it is entertaining in a superficial way. You should see it at least once or twice and make up your own mind."
3,a bit over-rated,"I must admit this movie has tons of style. It has absolutely no substance, however. If that is what you are looking for in a movie, then by all means see this one."
5,the greatest movie ever,"*definitely pick up the collector's edition if you are a tarantino fan......bonus materials include heavy dosages of tarantino, including his palm d'or acceptance film (won best picture at cannes film festival) and explanations regarding the film's deleted scenes*this movie is brilliant not only because of the way in which it was put together (intertwining events, etc.) but because it is a splendid balance of comedy, drama, action, wit, satire, and is a throught-provoking masterpiece"
5,Incomparable,"Some of the people who write here seem to have no understanding of the term fiction. This movie is fiction. The violence is NOT real. As Tarantino himself said, it is possible to like violence in movies and hate it in real life. A lot of people are like that, myself included. Violence in movies is not the same as violence in real life.That being said, I can move on and say that Pulp Fiction is probably the best American movie ever made. The plot is amazing, the visuals are eye catching and the acting is excellent. The movie leaves you feeling like it was too short, even though it's about 2 hours. It has a little bit of everything, and overall, it's just about as good as cinema can get."
3,Not as good as I thought,"After reading the reviews I thought this brush would be awesome, but it did not turn out to be awesome for my needs. My dog has wavy hair that tangles easily and this brush gets the tangles out, but I have to sit there for a very long time brushing to accomplish that. Also, she does not seem to like the feel of the brush, it is too rough for her skin. It is the best brush I have found to date. It might just be my dog; I just expected more after reading the reviews."
3,too sharp,"Described as soft bristles, not so. They are still like little needles, so have not used. Did get my money back"
5,DOES WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO!!!,"This brush is well made and does what it's supposed to. The bristles are a bit sharp, so you have to be careful not to prick yourself. If you have a skittish or tender-skinned dog, you also might want to take that into consideration. It does do a good job of removing the undercoat though."
4,Does what it's suppose to,"This slicker brush is just like it looks in the picture and is as described. It is currently a little too big for my 2 pound puppy but should be fine when he's full grown. The only thing I don't like is since the head is round, it is a bit awkward to get in the hard to reach places. If the brush was a rectangle, all the pins would be equally in rows but being an oval, the rows taper from the middle. Hope this helps."
5,Soft and efficient!,My puppy loves when I brush him with this! It removes quite a lot of hair.. Just be careful as the spikes are pointy!
4,Vast improvement,"My dog actually allows me to brush her with this brush. Although she still has hot spot, she actually seems to enjoy being brushed with this brush. She hated the wire brush I used to try to used on her. She would try to bite it and screamed when I tried to brush her with it. This one works great and the cat loves it too!"
5,Best slicker brush,I use this on my teddy bear and it works great and its perfect size for him. Definately recommend. And the soft part is great
5,My doxie thanks you!,This brush has been wonderful to use. The brush it replaced used to make my dachshund jump and try to get away every time I brushed him. Now he falls asleep while being brushed and it is so easy to clean the fur out of the brush without puncturing my cuticles. I highly recommend it!
4,Better than most!,Very nice grip on the handle. Well made. I would recommend for dogs with heavier coats than my long-haired chihuahua. Good value.
4,Nice but a little heavy & thick,"I purchased this slicker for my Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier. It is a soft slicker but the actual brush is a little awkward in the shape and size. The round brush part is thick, so for getting into matted areas like above the elbow it isn't the best. I think it would serve my needs a little better if it was smaller. It's a good brush just not exactly what I need."
1,Needs more vacation details,"I found this guide pleasant to look through, but not half as helpful as Best Dives of the Caribbean by Hunter Publishing, which gives a lot more detail on the dive sites, places for kids to snorkel, hotels and everything I need to plan a vacation."
3,Typical Murphy...but a good message,"The movie was ok...I liked parts of it. I watched with my older kids...awkward at times to say the least. The movie's premise was good - but I found it lacking in story depth. They could have taken this to so many levels and still combined Murpy's ability for comedic and serious acting talents. ""Daddy Day Care"" combined the silly and serious so much better than this film. It is too bad because the message of the movie was such a good one."
3,1000 Words,"The movie does have a cute premise. More swearing than expected. I know, I know what you're going to say - Eddy Murphey swears."
2,Eddie Murphy is losing it!,"I used to love Eddie Murphy. Lately, he is just plain terrible. This movie sucks and it was pretty much a waste of time."
4,CLEAN & FUNNY - NOT RAW,"Okay, so I enjoyed Eddie Murphy's Raw, but I enjoyed this too. Eddie Murphy has come a long way, and I feel that his movies provide reliable entertainment value, especially now when the bathroom humor has left me with my youth.This movie has a good story, and it wrapped up nicely in a laughter invoking package through to the end.I watched while laughing with my girlfriend, and enjoyed a good neutral movie (chick-flick v. man-show).I recommend it for a friday night when there's no plans for going out."
2,not a family movie,"The movie was just ok. It had too much profanity and adult innuendo to be considered a family movie. Which confuses me, since the message at the end was positive. There were only a few funny parts. It was definitely more drama than comedy."
3,Funny,"Like the ""Portrait of Dorian Grey"", there is more to the story than one might think. Eddie Murphy does not age, nor does his ability to make us laugh. Good job also, Mr. Chabat."
1,Terrible and NOT FAMILY freindly,"Eddie Murphy can ruin any promising plot with vulgar, lewd, and uncalled for trash humor. Whether him or the writers ruined this movie it reeks and is not suitable for mature adults let alone children..."
1,Waste of time,"I like most of Eddie Murphy's movies, but this is horrible. I never understood the plot or if there was one. After I dozed off once, I turned it off about half the way through."
3,The last movie that I will rent,"This will be the last movie that we will rent from Amazon. It is not because of the movie itself (it had great potential but a little crass at times), but because we are Christian and believe in what God and his book (the Bible) says: marriage is between one man and one woman. This was brought about because we recently read where, I believe his name is Mr. Boce (Amazon CEO), came out in support of gay marriage and backed it up by contributing several hundred million dollars to this cause. Since we cannot and will not support this behavior, and since Mr. Boce gets his funds to do this from us, we are exercising our freedom of speech and our religious beliefs to no longer support Amazon."
2,What were they thinking,"Though I like Eddie Murphy, unsurprisingly, A Thousand Words is not one of Eddie Murphy's classic roles that left me laughing. It has a laugh here and there, but for the most part the movie fails on comedy. Overall, the movie did have a a powerful message, but the sudden shift from comedy to drama made me wonder if the movie would not have been better suited as a drama ."
4,A Thousand Words,This movie is a typical Eddie Murphy movie. Great family entertainment that both young and old can watch and enjoy. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone for a night of good entertainment.
4,A Thousand Words,"It was a good movie. Eddie Murphy is always funny. Plus, there was a great message that I could take and apply to my own life."
3,a Thousand Words,I didn't think it was as funny as some people told me it was. Entertaining enough though. I love Eddie Murphy.
2,Eddie Fans will be satisfied...?,"There are many excellent review for this movie so I'll just add a few words of my own. If you are an Eddie Murphy fan, I think you will be satisfied with this film. His antics and timing are right on and he manages to rescue this film from obscurity. I took off one star for the New Age gobbledygook that has little to do with the real world and detracts from the story. Another star removed for the basic concepts of this film being repeats of Jim Carrey's ""Liar Liar,"" ""Yes Man,"" etc., and one more star for the notion that a father raising a child with his male partner could ever be considered cute. How could denying a child the love of a mother be in any way humorous?Enjoy the flim, then rent ""Beverly Hills Cop""..."
4,Amazon Verified Purchase,"I found this movie to be funny, typical Eddie Murphy. I feel this is a movie you want to be entertained, I would watch it again."
3,"unique plot, but is it good?","This movie was so so. Eddie Murphy is funny, to the point of overacting. I did really laugh at a restaurant scene. Yes, the plot is somewhat poignant and trys to get a little deeper towards the end, but I felt this movie fell short of what I expect from Eddie Murphy. Also, it amazes me the language that passes for PG-13.A Thousand Words is good for a few laughs, but for the most part, forgettable."
3,What Happened...,"Plain and simple, where are the jokes? There wasnt really anything funny in this movie. I miss the old Eddie Murphy. Better to stick with animation where he's still hysterical."
5,A Thousand Words,A Another Eddie Murphy HIT Has one Laughing from head to toe another Movie you will love if you like to laugh and have good time
2,"Poorly made, and mislabeled","First and foremost, this will NOT fit the first generation Nano, despite the fact that its advertised as such. Secondly, the case itself was extremely poorly made (you could see where someone just ""cut"" a spot for the on/off switch, uneven lines and all). Not recommended, and beware if you're ordering this for your 1G Nano..."
2,belt clip is a joke.,The case is great. I didn't receive the belt clip until I complained. I got the clip and is was useless. I was able to attach the original case belt clip to the new case which worked out great. It took my husband about an hour to figure out how to attach it. It basically doesn't have a belt clip.
3,Bloody good.,"This really is a half-hour beer commercial. Non-stop screaming, chanting, and just loud rocking. The lyrics are as basic as possible, but fit the music well. It's hard to say who Andrew sounds like, but it's definitely not all the hair-bands people keep mentioning. I actually like this quite a bit, especially when I'm feeling pumped and mindless, and obviously in the mood to party. ""She is beautiful"" is my favorite track. The disc is a bit short, but that might be a good thing since it's so repetitive. I do think it has the coolest cover art I've seen in awhile."
4,"""comfortable"" hard rock","This is one of the few cd's that, after listening to it once, sticks with you and feels good. Granted, that may be a direct result of some 80's rock influences, but who cares? Throw it in for a party or road trip, and those who are not familiar with Andrew will soak in the wetness as much as any fan. Screaming guitar, solid vocals, and a few innovative ""extras"" will please the hard rock junkie in you."
4,Hanz and Franz on wax,"Andrew's big debut is a combination of Meat Loaf, GWAR, early Motley Crue, and perhaps the Chemical People all in one disc... In other words ""this will pump you up."" No, your wife won't like it, your friends who are into Mr. Oberst won't like it, nor will your parents like it. That typically works for me."
1,A Dark Day in Music Indeed....,"Oh God they call this music? How did this guy get a record deal? I mean the lyrics are bad (Party Hard? C'mon!) and I couldn't stop laughing during the video for the Party Hard song (lol with WK headbanging while the words ""PARTY HARD"" are being strobed behind him that was hilariously bad) This is boring, tasteless music, and it brings back the days of the 80s. Pass this up, but I must say it makes a great coaster."
1,if you buy this you suck,"this is the most vapid and pathetic cd i've ever heard. EVER. The only reason I am reviewing this is to prevent any self-respecting music fan from the humility I am experiencing right now as I listen to this cd at work. DON't let anyone EVER see you in close proximity to this cd! Any cred you've no doubtedly spent years on building will be blown instantly! the best part about the album (beside the end if you make it that far) is the cover, i have a feeling that it was taken immediately after good ol' andrew handed the master tapes over to his record execs at Island. I woulda popped him one too! Unfortunately amazon doesn't have anything less that 1 star, because this cd is definitely beer coaster fodder. This guy is so bad he's the next Crazytown. They should have to listen to each others cd's and then kill themselves out of boredom."
1,wow,"wow seriously, dont be fooled by the terrible reviewers who said this album was great. This album is one where you should burn it off your friend, laugh at it for about 10 mins then thrown away. I mean its funny, but anyone who actually takes this music seriously must have something wrong with them. Really dont buy this album, you will regret it."
1,You can tell how bad it is...,"By the fact that nearly all the reviewers of this CD have an 6th-grade grasp of grammar and punctuation.In response to the many comparisons drawn between Andrew W.K. and various hair metal bands, I would say that such comparisons aren't fair. Andrew W.K. is far less talented than any popular 80's metal band. I'd go so far as to say he's less talented than Britney Spears. Power chords aren't that impressive if you don't have anything to say."
5,Party Hard....it's about time!,"OK, we went through the guilt and sorrow that was grunge, sat through the pompus britpop wave, even got snotty with indie rock. NOW, it's time to PARTY HARD. This album is making it okay to have fun again. It's not deep by any means. Andrew WK is just opening a door for all of us to come on into his party."
5,The best thing since the Abbey Road E.P.,"Ok...so i go down to my record store and pick up ""I Get Wet""...i pop it in my cd player and am BLOWN AWAY!...this cd has a great mix of 80's hair metal (but without the each song sounding the same type thing) and 80's pop (the keyborad synth type thing)...""I Get Wet"" sounds like a warped ""Twisted Metal"" soundtrack...from the first song (It's Time To Party), immediately you think of an out of control college frat house...this cd has everything for every fan of rock...in fact, it's rock's savior. BUY IT AND GO TO THE SHOWS!!!Dan"
3,Nice...but all the songs sound the same!,"PARTY HARD is by far the greatest song on this album, a great headbanger! However, many of the tracks on here sound very similar. 1 and 2 are practically the same song! If you listen to the samples, you'll know exactly what I mean. But Andrew W.K is cool nevertheless. The front cover would suit a band like Pig destroyer more though!Decent punk music!"
1,So bad it's great,I listen to this album with my friends when we need something to laugh. There is NO WAY to listen to this stuff without cracking up. I Love NYC and Get Ready to Die are especially funny.
5,I got wet.,"There comes a point in every young boy's life when he must become a man. For ancient Indians the rituals wre painful and slow, for the American of the 50's demeaning and debasing but for our generation Andrew WK is that ritual.From dale to mountain top, I Get Wet is a rollercoaster ride of energy and excitement. Every time you think you've found the high point to the album, along comes the next song and WHAM you're up higher than you've been before.And epic recording with surefire tunes like 'She is Beautiful', 'I Get Wet', and 'Lets Get Ready to Die', I Get Wet is sure to become a staple on all time best critic's lists."
5,Party till you put your head in a wall,"As stupid, simple and cerebral as Iggy Pop. Perfect. All you biters can go be depressed with your knew strokes CD.I HAVEN'T KILLED ANYONE SINCE 1984 - C. WALKEN"
5,"Party, anyone?","If you like to party, buy this album. It's that simple. This CD is chock-full of good ol' rock with 12 intense tracks to get your heart pumpin. It's obvious that Andrew W.K. put all of his heart, blood, sweat, and tears (mostly blood and sweat) into this album to make it by far one of the best rock albums of the year. Perfect party CD. Buy it"
5,SAVIOR OF ROCK,"i first heard andrew wk a few months ago through a friend and within a few days i was hooked, he is absolutlty amazing, every song on this cd is amazing and will keep your energy up 200 percent with their amazing wall of sound for the length of it. my personal favorites are ""get ready to die"" and ""she is beautiful"". and after you buy this cd and know every song everyone should try to see him in concert, he puts on an amazing show and if extremely friendly to the fans after the show. 5 STARS. this music is pulling us out of the musical slump we are in and have been in for quite a while. i recommend it 100 percent, it will stay in your cd player for weeks."
4,"Relax, people.","Whoever said that this disc was [bad] obviously does not know how to cut back and have some fun. Granted, many of the songs are basically the chorus repeated 4 times, and they often run together. But still, it is good for that kind of primal release where you can just let loose and ""Party Hard"" no matter what mood you are in. And it also provides a good soundtrack for going 90 miles per hour down I-70."
5,If Motorhead ever went mainstream!,"Remember the excess of the 80's? No messages, no angst no meaning. Pure entertainment! The kind of music you would pop in to go out for the evening and get crazy with the boys and or girls. Imagine if you put Poison, Cinderella, Whitesnake and a pinch of 90's edge in a blender without the cover on and hit frappe. Andrew W.K. detractors need to lighten up. Music is entertainment in its purest form."
3,OK,"Good basic party rock. No real substance here, just some bouncy tunes. Not that it matters, or maybe it does, but too bad the cover is so icky."
3,PARTY ON!!!,"This is the most refreshingly entertaining album to be played on mtv and the radio in a long time. this isn't great music, and doesnt take much talent, but it's cachy, reminiscent of the 80's(which is a good thing), and is just party music. so all you self proclaimed ""music critics"" need to step back, cool out, and party hard."
3,I like to party,"My first reaction was this guy likes to party.My second reaction was this guy loves gang vocals. He must have a good collection of Def Lepard and Y & T albums.I'm tempted to say that the songs sound one-dimensional; the many songs with screaming,layered vocals, the 2:2 drum beats, and the blaring riffs all run together. But as I listen to more songs, I realize this guy is a serious student of the metal genre, mixing the styles of pop-metal (Bon Jovi, Europe, etc). with some of the harder bands like Judas Priest and Motley Crue.The senseless lyrics, the catchy melodies, and the passing reference to death accompanied by a minor chord are on par with most bands in the 80's. However this guy sounds pretty tongue and cheek, which is more than most metal acts could claim. Is this guy is serious, he must be from Germany or at least a Scorpions fan.Listening to this album makes me want to down a twelve-pack of light beer and watch porno movies.I like it."
5,Buy This CD!!!,"upbeat and fun...easily one of the greatest party cds of my generation...get pumped up, throw in this cd, crank the volume, and have a blast."
5,its the new Kiss,"This cd rocked from the time i put it in till two weeks later when i finally swapped in another. This is party rock at its best. No BS, just plain party!!! Get it, you won't be sorry!!"
4,Its time to PARTY!!! LETS PARTY!!!,"... What is this album all about in the first place? It's about having a good time doing what you dig, being yourself. This is just like a ramones album with a very layered guitar sound which makes the album sound really loud. Its pretty damn simple and formulaic. And the thing is that no one is trying to trick ye of little faith. Sure, its not Metallica's Master of Puppets or Cinderella. Thank God!!! Its a good old pop rock/punk record driven by keyboards and guitars (lots and lots of guitars.) Not brilliant by most standards, but why not just enjoy yourself once and a while?"
4,Very upbeat,"Let me start out by saying that I bought this album for ""Party Hard,"" and I thought it was worth it.Yes, all the songs are very similar. And as for the lyrics-- yes, they lack the cleverness of the Ramones. However, it is very energetic. Emotionally, it gets you pumped up and makes you feel like you want to go do something positive but violent (or at least physically challenging). The last time I listened to this album, I wound up cleaning my living room & rearranging all the furniture!I think that people who respond primarily to the emotional energy of music will enjoy the album."
2,FUN BUT REPETITIVE,"Yes, this is a fun record, and reminds me of the 80's music, but I kinda like to here some variety within a record! The songs on Andrew W.K.s' I Get Wet, all sound the same, and it's like one long song, with only a few speed variations! I like ""party hard"", and is why I bought the c.d., but all the songs sound like this, so I guess I like all the songs? I also like to hear some sort of vocals, this is all chanting, like a football team or something. Other tracks that I like are ""she is beatiful"", and ""I love N.Y.C."" Hopefully Andrew's next record will be titled ""I Get Variety""!!!"
2,Nice and lovable CD cover. But not the music.,"Contrary to my tendency to buy an album after hearing it patiently and carefully, I must concede that I bought this CD because of the violent impression that gave me its cover depicting Andrew WK's face covered in deep red blood. While I love the cover, I just can't say the same about the music, which seems to me that is a new, pumped-up version of bands like Bon Jovi, Cinderella or Poison: a boy-band silly, beat-repeating danceable music with a little roughness in its edge. And add fried keyboards to go, please. A pity of an album, considering that Andrew's voice is really wonderful. So, if you're the Slayer type, don't waste your time like I did. Just enjoy watching the CD cover."
4,"Yes, it's crap, but it's the best crap ever made","Look. I'm well aware of how inane and stupid this album is. And it's the exact atithesis of every jaded 1990's everything-sucks band I've had to put up with as I grew up with the letter X stamped onto my forehead by the Baby Boomers. This album is our revenge. Take it or leave it.Combine 80's bubblegum with Operation Ivy's anger and Def Leppard's polish and listen to it all at Motorhead's volume and you've got this album. It's never been done before and never been pulled off as well. That reason alone makes this album important regardless of how trite and meaningless the content is.Believe me, I've got high standards regarding music. If someone as snobby as me prefers Autechre and Pete Yorn over garbage like Motley Crue and New Kids on the Block, yet STILL likes Andrew W.K., it should say something about this poor guy."
5,probably the record of the year,nothing this year has come even close to touching the sheer dudeness of this album full of instant beer commercial classics.
5,you cannot kill the party...,"wow. its like everyone either loves or hates this album. i can see why. this album is just an audio-only version of a simply amazing live show. anyone who says this is generic... well theyre probably right. but its just so catchy and mindless and beutiful that you just want to headbang along with it. andrew is def. for a selective crowd, people that loves to party and jump around and have fun. i give it 5 stars because i love this album, but truly it is a love it or hate it experience. this is the kind of album in which you download ""she is beutiful"", ""party hard"" and ""ready to die"" and if you like it, buy it, and if you dont, well then dont. dont make the mistake of buying it if you dont like that type of thing, you WONT like it. just listen to it first to make sure"
5,A BREATH OF FRESH AIR,"This album is one of the best I've heard in a long time. In an age where boy bands and rap dominates the music scene, Andrew W.K. captured the essence of hair metal. With loud guitar riffs, slamming drums, and , oddly enough, classical piano. I think the way A.W.K. incorporates his talent for piano into rock and roll sets his music apart. ""I Get Wet"" is a breath of fresh air from the generic rock of today and should not go unnoticed. So do yourself a BIG favor and pick up a copy of ""I Get Wet"" today. PARTY HARD"
3,"One great song, a bunch of knock-offs","OK, ""Party Hard"" rocks better than anything else out there today. Very fresh, very fantastic. But... All the rest of the songs sound like pale imitations of the album's one true gem. ""I Get Wet"" is worth the cheap price anyway -- for the bloody artwork and the pleasure of supporting the Prince of Party -- but don't expect a disc crammed with amazing songs."
5,"andrew wk, the future of all that is good.","i heard about andrew wk from some friends who were visiting from england. he was already fairly big there evidently before ""i get wet"" started making a commotion here in the states.and i truly have to thank them. right as i was getting bored with everything that was being put out lately in the music world, i heard ""i get wet"" and was amazed. the album is fun, energetic and lets you know that you should really be having a good time no matter what.metal influence but poppy in the best kind of way, you can't help but sing, pump your fists in the air and dance around like there is no tomorrow. if you haven't yet heard any of his music you must check andrew wk out. as terrible rock rules the airwaves he is a breath of fresh, fun, air."
4,Plain and Simple... (4.5 stars indeed),"Remember those 80s movies where the Coreys (Haim & Feldman) just wanted to have fun and get chicks?!??!?!? WK music its part of those soundtracks...This is a big throwback to the 80s, there are some guys who say that WK sounds like the 80s glam, i dont think so... WK sounds like Van Halen (even the booklet includes a photograph of WK making a jump ""a la"" David Lee Roth)or Def Leppard but louder (and 15 years later)!!Big guitar riffs, shouts, and stupid lyrics, this is what you'll find in WK's first complete album.At least 4 songs of this record would become rock hymns for soccer stadiums, and the next teen movie will include some of this...Buy it if you liked the Lost Boys, Karate Kid or any movie from the Haim & Feldman connection..."
4,ha.... ha ha.... i don't get it.,"after listening to this album, you're left asking yourself... what the hell? how could you possibly classify this? it sounds like nothing else. it's... uh, hair metal, played with lots of synth, only, much more up to date, and heavier. and... HAPPY?! this is one odd duck. yes, many of the songs sound the same, but if you like it, you won't care. andrew w.k. sort of proves a first-time point- it's okay to bash the hell out of everything, and be HAPPY about it. it's pretty weird. and certainly not ""cool"" by any means... but everyone has a different definition of that. either you're going to like this, or you're going to hate it. yes, it's a parody. yes, it's okay to like this.listen to the samples. if you like what you hear, get the record and you'll love it. if you don't... listen to some RAMMSTEIN."
1,Ironic 80's rock or just unimaginative?,"Wow. This is really awful. Reminds me of the Reagan era. I don't know what else to say.No...wait; yes I do. Andrew W.K. MAY be making this music in earnest, and make no mistake that this is PAARRTAAAY music, but it is terribly boring party music. Full of bombast, but it doesn't stick and it won't last. I think back to some great dancing/drinking/sexy music, and this don't doesn't hold up under their grooviness. Think of Jerry Lee Lewis, the Meters, Jackson Five, The Cars, Prince, KISS, Funkadelic, even the Bee Gees...will you remember these Andrew WK songs in light of these others? I'm betting not. Then again, if the sonic equilvalent of Mc Donalds is what you are into (read: filling, but ultimately empty), this may be your thing."
1,Outdated 80's Glam Rock,"I dunno, so far I've only heard two sound samples from this silly guy and he sounds like outdated 80's glam rock. Not only that but quite frankly if your looking for just plain old rock and roll there are far better artists out there then freaking Andrew W.K. Just to name one of them Local H. Besides, can't he write about more mature themes then partying? Why do I ask that? Because anyone can write about partying, it's not a hard subject to tackle... Oh yeah, also saw him perform on SNL, meh... Nothing all that great about the performance there. I dunno, for what your money is truly worth there is better stuff to spend it on. Is your 15 dollars truly worth a 40, maybe 45, minute cd about partying all night?"
1,Obviously a joke,"True, Andrew W.K. is obviously a joke. But I do have to respect anyone with the guts to release an album with songs like this. Ode to partying? Alright, at least Andy W.K. is having fun."
5,It rocks.,"I Get Wet is one of the best rock albums I have EVER heard. It is unapologetically simple, but the music is so complex and wonderful that you can't help but rock out to it. If you like rock, you'll love this album. Buy it now."
5,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"This album is purely fun all the way through. I listened to it with my little sister once and she usually hates the music I listen to, but even she liked Andrew W.K. I lost my first copy of this album, but I went and bought it again because it is THAT good! Buy this album ASAP if you don't already own it. You won't regret it."
5,Yay,"This isn't an album for the chin-stroking intellectual, subtlety isn't a word in Andrews vocabulary it would seem. Its a return to the fist-pumping anthems of yesteryear, and I couldn't be more pleased. This is the cure for noodling, alienation, and boredom. It is headbanging music, it is the enemy for the elitists, its ultra-polished heavy metal with absolutely no apologies for being that way. Its extraordinarily catchy, I put this on in the car, I get strange looks, but then we all headbang in unison, its wonderful. So, for 30 minutes of power to cleanse yourself of your loneliness and despair or of a dose of Amnesiac, look no farther."
5,It's Time To Party....,"Never in my life have I heard a CD of this magnitude. I originally saw the video for ""Party Hard"" on MTV2, and decided that it was worth checking out. After purchasing the CD and popping it in my player, the awesome force that is Andrew W.K. hit me like a ton of bricks. This is one of those CDs you can listen to, start to finish, but also be able to hit repeat disc on your player. Definetly check it out if you get the chance."
5,listen to this!!!!,"this cd is awesome!(...)every song on this album is awesome(...)ok, enough of that. now you can have fun night and say it's time to party and then just party hard when you buy this album for just $13.98! yeah!!!!!!!! IT'S TIME TO PARTY(...)"
1,I get wet is right?,"I get wet when your dying? What the hell does that mean. This is they worst thing in rock music right now. Not to mention it has some wierd twist of hip hop culture. I heard the British press thought this was a good album, but they also thought Coldplay was the next radiohead. So lets not get a party started."
1,Andrew WK is the Robert Frost of metal!,"Wow, this has to be the most pathetic record I have ever heard in my life. Just think, for only $15 you get to listen to some skanky grease-monkey bang his head and sing about parties. This guy has a very diverse lyrical vocabulary. He starts off with parties, then moves on to partying, then finishes off with partying till he pukes. Andrew WK is the Robert Frost of heavy metal. Did I meantion the awesome musical composition as well? Every bloody song sounds the same, and Andrew has failed to realize that there is more than ONE key on a piano. Its lame, its a joke, it just really sucks bad. Dont ruin your cd collection by adding this piece of crap. And in the great words if WK : ""PARTY HARD!PARTY HARD! PARTY HARD! LETS GET A PARTY GOIN!!"""
1,This is really bad...,"This is seriously the worst thing I have ever heard. When i hear it, i usually laugh because its so bad that its funny! I can't emphasize any more how dumb and terrible this is..."
5,Andrew W.K Rocks!,"Andrew W.K is an amazing cd! It makes you wanna get up and party. Unlike alot of hard rock bands and artists, this cd has a positive attitude while still maintaining the heavy sound. It's a great album that keeps you head banging but cheers you up!"
4,"For those who wanna party, get this album NOW.","I have always liked Andrew W.K., but it wasn't until recently that I picked up I Get Wet. All the songs are fast, loud, hard, and even melodic. That piano in the background really adds to a majority of the songs. I guess you can describe this album as a mix of metal, pop, and dance. It is an unbelievable album, though it is kinda short (35 minutes). But if you're a die-hard fan, an avid partier, or just like loud music, this album won't disappoint."
5,AWK is a god.,"The messages that Andrew W K and his album deliver are incredible. Its an Album for thoughs who live life for every drop, and want to savor every second, and not waste any of it, for people who want to party hard, and live life to the fullest. The message AWK delivers is like a bible of today, not to waste life, and that eveyrthing should be experienced to the max. BUY THIS ALBUM!"
2,I was really psyched... but...,"I was really psyched that power metal is back. I love this genre. I love the way ""Party Hard"" sounds... I love the hook. I love the use of the one-chord pulsing piano and the major scale melodies in that song.Except... I was a little disappointed when...The whole album sounded the same way!!!These guys are talented... but they copied ""Party Hard"" a dozen times! The same one-chord pulsing piano is also in ""She is Beautiful"" and most of the other songs! The same major scale melody (and in most cases, even the same notes) are used! The same structure is used for all of the songs, the same formula.Doesn't the phrase ""Let's get a party goin'..""sound extremely similar to:""She is beautiful...""? That's what I'm talking about!If you know nothing about music theory, then let me put it this way:ALL OF THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME.They all talk about the same thing. It had wonderful potential. But Andrew WK lacks a LOT of diversity. A LOT."
4,Great book with only one gripe...,"My one gripe is that the plans included with the book are close to useless. They're on tiny paper, and need to be severely enlarged before they can be used.Other than that, this book is an excellent look at what goes into building a stitch and glue kayak. I've built a boat designed by this author, using only plans purchased through the resources listed in the book, and spent many hours on Long Island Sound, the Connecticut River, and the Texas Gulf Coast enjoying slipping silently through the water.The time estimates are correct, even for someone who is only moderately familiar with wood-working. His materials lists are complete, and the recommendations made are worth paying attention to. In my building, I went contrary to a couple of the book's reccommendations; in hindsight, I would have followed the book much more closely."
1,dont buy this book for the plans,"Hii bought this book for the plans actually , but as other pepole said the plans are pretty useless , everything in them are very tiny .if i read the reviews before i probably wasnt buy the book"
4,Take it for what it is,"Yes, this book relies on CLC kits, and is tied to CLC. No, it does not provide stand alone plans. On the other hand, it is a good read, and provides a clear, concise overview of the assembly process for these boats- which is why I bought it in the first place."
2,Dated and too fast-paced,"This book was first printed in 1962, and it really shows, with many examples of old-style orthography and few examples that will be useful to modern students. The book progresses from the fundamentals of the writing system to ""Liberalization Plans in Foreign Trade Exchange"" and ""The Forms of T'ang Poetry"" in less than two hundred pages, leaving little room for explanation. As a result, this book might be a useful textbook within the context of an advanced class, but it's not of much use to students studying on their own. It's also worth noting that nearly all of my Japanese books, including everything from novels to popular texts on psychology, are easier than even the 'intermediate' articles in this reader; this book is more liable to scare off students (even relatively advanced ones) than to provide either education or interesting reading materials."
4,Heavy Duty Reader for the Committed,"This is an excellent primer on written Japanese, but it is not for the fainthearted! It is true that it is a bit dated (a lot of stuff from the fifties included) but it covers the field of written Japanese extensively in an extremely small amount of space. If (like me) you took up Japanese after you had already learned to read Chinese, you'll probably find this book a useful way to jump into reading while avoiding going through the basics of the writing system all over again.The book also covers a lot of details on the writing system (proper names, furigana principals, pre-1945 standard usage) that you can spend a lot of time looking for in other books, often to no avail. If you're really serious about getting into reading Japanese, it's a good book to work with, but be warned - it moves along at a vicious pace."
2,Avoid....outdated,"One of the problems of someone like me, and probably you, is finding a Japanese reader that wasn't written over 40 years ago!The Japanese government established a standard set of Kanji, around 2,000 in 1981 (? not positive about the date) so anything written much more than 20 years ago will contain Kanji that you won't find in a dictionary, and that are not used.Also, not only are the Kanji no longer used but the expressions are antiquated.So a suggestion for an alternative? I don't know, someone tell me...I'm still looking..."
1,Should have listened....,"I should have paid attention to the other reviews, but I really wanted to give my niece a bank like this so I bought it anyway. Didn't work at all. We changed batteries, jiggled everything that could be jiggled, but still no luck. Too bad, because it's a very cute bank with bright colors; perfect for a little girl. If only it actually worked. Hey, is it possible we all received and returned the same item? Maybe someone should mark the box!"
4,fun,I got it and i love it so if you get it just don't put a lot of coins into it at a time or it will jam. Other than that it is great.
1,Useless,"I bought this product and followed the directions to the letter. Sun, shade, or indoors this stuff never cured or hardened. All it did was leave a slimy residue on my board. This product is garbage. Do not buy it!!"
2,Not impressed,In a thick amount this product hardens up but the falls off. It has an oily residue which seems to prevent it from bonding to a surface. I ended up just taking my board to a repair shop.
2,Not very durable,I used the Sun Cure Fiber Fill kit the first day of skim boarding at the beach. I have a skim board that is made of the same materials surf boards are. The curing time was correct from the box descriptions and since I wanted to make sure the bond was extra strong I waited all night before using it the next day. The material chunked off within 1-2 hours of riding. It didn't bond well and became sharp and dangerous.
3,Part 1 of 3,"If you can make thru the first chapter, you have a pretty good book. Not that the first chapter was all bad, but way to much we didn't need to know was told. Chapter 7 was a little long in repetitiveness too. But good work in bringing out character development, with the people Conan meet in this adventure. The ending at the slave caravan is worth the read alone. But back at the sorcerer's castle, be find that it is really not the end. Conan's soul is still caught. Worth picking up and reading-ERIC"
1,A Naked Tale,"This book could have benefitted from some serious editing. Reading it, I get the feeling that the publishing company let the author down in the editing process. The enthusiasm is there, a basically decent plot line and character development emerges from its pages. But Offutt is repetitive. For example, the tavern where we meet Conan at the start of the book is described and redescribed and described again. I did enjoy the art. More of a novelty for a Conan collection than anything else. Better yet, stay away."
3,Just the basics.,A very brief synopsis of what zooarchaeology is capable of. Very good for an inexperienced beginner.
2,Interesting but totally unconvincing,Reliance upon theological jargon does not add clarity to his unfortunate premise. The problem human response to God's plan to rescue those who wish to spend eternity with Him.
5,okay,these work just fine only one problem that you should know about since it is 6 pin to 4 pin the other 2 pins it loses are the power so it must have external power
2,could have been much better,"I was excited about the idea of reviving this old classic with some new technology, and for the most part the designers achieved their mission. However, they created two fatal errors that seriously hampered play. Firstly, the background scene with its space detail makes an excellent camouflage, obscuring the action. Secondly, there is no adjustability with the key board control settings. This would normally not be a concern except that the placement of the controls (as they are permanently set) does not flow at all on the key board. I guess what I really was hoping for was the original fun with modern improvement. Unfortunately the original fun of the game was lost due to to much tampering."
3,Good collection with at least one typo,"My confidence in this personal and somewhat quirky collection was undermined when I turned to W.S. Merwin's lovely and powerful ""For the Anniversary of My Death,"" (which begins ""Every year without knowing it I have passed the day/ When the last fires will wave to me"")and saw to my dismay that it had a typo in the last line, changing ""bowing"" to ""boding"" and thereby wrecking the poem. Unfortunate oversight. Neruda and other South Americans are noticeable by their absence, begging the question of whether Milosz harbors a grudge."
2,CONTROLER,I personally dont really like the shape of the regaular gc controler the part that goes on your palms it's not at all comfortable it is to sharp the playstation or n64 is perfect
1,Looks like a bargain,"But it isn't. I have three and i know because all three stopped working properly. The only thing it is good for is as a trick controller considering the fact that the joystick becomes non responsive or drifts in wrong directions by its self (ex. point up, it goes up + left). It is clunky and heavy. For some reason the turbo light goes on and stays lit on one of the controllers but stays off on the other two no matter how many times it is pressed. Yet another problem is that it is shaped slightly differently than the nintendo one and it is harder (not too much) to get to the a and b buttons. Definitely get the Nintendo controller because I have had no problems with the one that came with my game cube."
3,still not good enough,"This controller is like the GC controller except the B button is shaped like the X and Y buttons, it has an on/off switch for rumble, the D pad is larger, and it has some grip on the handles. In addition, the analog stick has a slower reaction time than the GC controller. This can be a major pain when playing a game which requires quick maneuvering."
2,It's Ok for a while...,"This controller is kind of comfortable and works well for about a month. I bought one like this and used it for a few weeks, but after a while it started to not respond at all. This became especially clear with ""James Bond: Agent under Fire"" (A great game though). I thought it was just that controller so i bought another one and it worked for a while and i thought problem solved. But the same thing happened. It stopped responding and now i have to junk controllers that sometimes work on some games. I highly recomend the wireless wavebird controller instead."
4,Best gamecube controller out there(Besides wireless.),This controller is by far the best. For people with teen sized hands the controller fits perfect. It is only a bit heavier also. The turbo button works quite well in a couple of games where rapid fire is useful. The grip makes it so you can comforatably set it in your hands. This is definately a must buy if you dont have enough for the wireless controller. It is real good for a 3rd party controller and is even better than the origional nintendo controller. This is a very good contoller if you dont have alot to spend and want a contoller that sends gaming to the limits. There is my two cents.
3,Tries to be what it's not,"I rented this movie while on my Greta Scacchi binge and it fared poorly compared to others like The Coca-Cola Kid and White Mischief (released the same year).Peter Coyote tries to be dark and brooding as an American actor shooting a docu-drama on location in Italy. Greta Scacchi is the young beauty who lands the leading lady role. Coyote is smitten by her and they continue their on-screen passion away from the cameras.Jamie Lee Curtis is miscast as Coyote's wife who flies in to check up on him. She figures out he is having an affair but is helpless to do anything about it. Obviously, heartache ensues.I kept on getting the feeling while watching this movie that it was trying really hard to be European art house, but coming off flat. Perhaps if it was in another language...?I did enjoy seeing the still beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Scacchi's mother."

1,What a lousy company!,"I have bought this product for 1 year. When I received it, I found one of the cds is broken and email them for replacing it. After 4-5 months, I emailed them almost 10 times and what I got were few auto-reply mails and 2 insincere mails from Mr. or Ms. no name. Yes, NOT ANY cd was sent to me! It's really a very terrible experience I got! Cause the same problem I have had with another company--I got another broken cd from Hemera. They were responsible for sending a replacement cd to me soon via international express. That impressed me! Ha! These 2 companies are so different!!!"
4,Not bad,"Just instrumental music of popular songs. That said, our daughter seems to like it. more words required for this review..."
4,Ben Folds Five: Three is Enough,"Actually a trio, these funsters from Baltimore will make you laugh, cry and become a part of them. Perhaps I'm overly sentimental, but if you like Joe Jackson (vocals) and Billy Joel (piano) you will like these guys.They will be HUGE."
3,Whatever And Ever Amen,"I bought this album mostly based on one song (""Brick""), so the first surprise I encountered was Folds' extremely dirty mouth, which was definately unexpected. After hearing the first few tracks, I also noticed how the band jumps back and forth with a fun, jumpy song (""Fair""), a slow, depressing song (""Brick""), and then back to a fast, catchy song (""Song For The Dumped""). The only problem I had with the album is that a few of the slow songs were too slow for me. When I'm listening to the album, I can't help but skip ""Selfless, Cold, and Composed,"" ""Cigarette,"" and ""Evaporated."" I think it would do the band justice to stick to more upbeat songs, like ""Kate,"" although throwing in a song like ""Brick"" could never hurt. This is still one of the coolest bands I've ever listened to that lacks a guitar."
2,Not quite,"Ben Folds Five to me are like a note that is ever so slightly flat - all the more annoying because it is so close to being right on the money. The hit song ""Brick"", for example, is a brilliant pop tune, cleverly arranged and straightforwardly recorded. The vocal performance and words, while attempting to be serious and world-weary, brings it to earth with a thud, as does the remarkably poor metaphor upon which this series of numbing images revolves - ""she's a brick""?! Brick is a clunky word, and describes the situation well enough I suppose if we can call a person such a thing, but the clunk is at odds with the flow of the music. No cigars here."
2,Weaker than I expected,"I bought their debut album (""Ben Folds Five"") and Ben Folds' solo effort (""Rockin' the Suburbs"") before I listened to ""Whatever and Ever Amen"", and I have to say that this album looks worse for the comparison. The ""catchy pop"" songs on this album don't have the frenetic rookie stylings or strong hooks of the first album. With the exception of ""Brick"", the deep character introspections aren't as strong as those on ""Rockin' the Suburbs"".""Whatever and Ever Amen"" seems more like an attempt to create saleable radio tracks than a sincere effort, with a lot of modern-rockish pop mix techniques but not much feeling. There are 2 or 3 standout songs, but the album didn't work for me."
5,Amazing CD,"Ben Folds Five is just an amazing group. Ben Folds songwriting ability is staggering. Whatever and Ever Amen is a CD that I know completely by heart. Every song is relatable, from the anger of ""Song for the Dumped,"" to the heartbreak of ""Selfless, Cold and Composed,"" to the lovelorn confusion of ""Fair."" This CD is a must-buy for anyone that wants to hear great music. Even without a guitar, Ben Folds Five never disappoints."
5,Ben Folds Five CD,My husband really liked it. It was his favorite Ben Folds Five CD. He gave it to his brother for Christmas.
5,An Essential Album,"Buoyed by the success of the song ""Brick,"" Whatever And Ever Amen went on to be Ben Folds Five's best selling album by a landslide. And why not? The album contains the most diverse collection of songs that the band wrote (with Folds of course at the helm) while they were together. Tongue-in-cheek bubblegum pop (Kate), a very mature take on forgetting the past (Smoke), songs that dabble in jazz styles (Selfless, Cold, And Composed, and Steven's Last Night In Town), and a raw, candid examination of one's self (Evaporated). The bonus tracks on this re-mastered edition are just icing on the cake as they say. Though I recommend their self-titled debut for an introduction to the band (and really, it's great to listen to their albums sequentially as you can really see the growth in their songwriting), you certainly can't go wrong with WAEA."
4,Ben Folds Five,Ben Folds is a genius. I love his mixture of beautiful piano music and hysterically funny or devastatingly sad lyrics. This album is the epitome of an emotional roller coaster. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys piano music and soothing melodies.
5,Perfect,"""Whatever and Ever Amen"" is the only album that I own that I could truely call flawless. Every single song makes sense to me and every song fits the album to a ""t"". This album has been there for me through good times and bad. From failed relationships to starting new ones. Again, nothing short of amazing. My highest personal recommendation."
5,My Life passion!,"I love them all, every song! Ben Folds Five is the single most exceptional band there is out there today. I listen to Whatever and Ever Amen every single day, and sleep with it under my pillow. I'm obsessed! Why? Ben Fols Five is the only music out there that is actually..... good."
4,"Excellent album, almost as good as their 1st!","The two songs that made it as commercial hits are ""Battle of Who Could Care Less"" and ""Brick"", but there are four or five other great songs on this album."
4,"Can't go wrong with Ben, but you can try","All right... I love Ben Folds. I've got 4 CD's, a single, and his weird solo album, and I love it all. However, if you're looking to buy some of his stuff, I have to say that this is the last thing you should buy. There are 4 really good songs, some good songs, and some mediocre songs on this album. For most bands that would be a good show, but for BF5 it's fairly disappointing, it seems to me as if they were trying to go mainstream (and, to a certain extent, it worked). I love the classic anger/humor of ""One Angry Dwarf"" and the cheerful worship of ""Kate"", but... in my own defense, even Ben doesn't like ""Brick"" anymore. (If you listen really closely on Fear of Pop...) Do yourself a favor and buy the debut or Messner instead. 3 1/2 stars."
4,my favorite cd in my pile ^-^,"I am absolutely in love with this cd. I didn't like the first, fourth, and sixth tracks (One Angry Dwarf, Song for the Dumped, and Kate), mainly because they just aren't my style. But with that aside the only reason why I can't quite give it 5 stars is that honestly, the lead singers voice isn't that...good. He has a _great_ sound, but not much control. He might actually run the risk of ruining it if he's not careful, which would be a tragedy. The music itself is fantabulous. Especially Selfless, Cold and Composed!"
5,excellent CD,"BF5 succeeds wildly with their mix of upbeat and driving swing-inspired piano hullabaloos and their bittersweet evocative songs. From the fury of ""Steven's Last Night in Town"" to the joyful romp of ""Kate"" to the beauty of ""Smoke"", Ben Folds Five present a very varied and never disappointing cd. A must-have for many different types of fans."
5,It will never sink like a brick !,I loved it. All my friends liked the song brick but never new that it was about abortion. I know all the words and love it!
4,A more funny fatastic style of lyrics in the 90's!,"I bought this CD only for the whimsical song ""Brick,"" and yet I was quiantly suprised by the comedic tone of the over-all compact disc! ""Steven's Last Night in Town"" will certainly put a smile on any face and the strong tones in ""Brick"" will bring back memories! The inspirational scales that this singer brings to market are more then just musical quips, they bring feeling to what I feel would be a rather dull song sung by almost anyone else!"
5,masterpiece,"What can you say that has not been allready noted about this amazing record. With myself being a guitar player, it would seem strange that my favorite band would not have a guitar in it's lineup. This was the first BFF record I bought, and first played it while doing yardwork. The more I played it, the more astounded I was at how beautiful each song is. Ben produces chord sequences almost effortlessly that differ from anything I have ever heard. Listening to this album makes me want to drive downtown around all the art venues. Living in North Carolina (Ben was from Chapel Hill) certainly makes it even sweeter to see that NC is finally on the map. Go buy this underrated ""one-hit-wonder"" record right now."
5,"Great sounds, Great depth","I first heard this CD in a friend's car. I usually don't like his music. Despite myself, I loved this one! Great beat, great vocals. I purchased it. It was then that I _truly_ started appreciating it. Being a musician myself, I appreciated the musicality and intricacy of the music. Then I Got more into the lyrics - wow! Such artful ways of describing things, and such evocation! I drove around for about two months with this CD in my player - I just kept playing it over and over.If you like music with great lyrics and driving beat, you will definitely LOVE this one."
5,This is the album to start your BFF collection with!,"This should start your BFF collection and at the same time, assure that you'll never stop collecting! BFF are fun piano punk. Think Billy Joel's ability, Sex Pistols attitude and that hilarious guy from college dorms writing the lyrics. This dips into swing and odd time signatures. Consummate musicians that put rocking first. They're infectious!"
2,Its pretty bad,"I love the song brick, so i thought i would buy the album. Bad choice. The song brick is nothing like the rest of the songs on the cd. There are a couple decent songs on the cd, but overall its pretty bad and i listen to it about 1 every 2 months."
1,"""This is not rock!""","The only reason this album deserves 1 star is because of two reasons! I couldn't give it a half star and only two songs on this album keep me from burning it! Whatever Ben Folds Five think they are doing, it is not music.First of all, Ben Folds cannot sing worth a flip. The only song that he shows even a smudge of talent is ""Brick."" I will admit ""Brick"" is an awesome song. Its beautifully written and it conveys a great amount of emotion. The only other plus on this album is ""One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces."" This song is just fun thats the only reason I like it. Ben still can't sing on this one but the words make it fun. Other than that, songs like ""Fair"" ""Song for the Dumped"" and ""Smoke"" really make this album the piece of crap that it is. Ofcourse, ""Brick"" will make this one sell. In this day in age, you don't need a good song; you just need one hit. Sorry Ben, but you didn't decieve me!"
2,one star for each good song on this cd,one angry dwarf = very good. song for the dumped = very good. all other songs (including brick) = mushy oatmeal. save your $.
5,"Wonderful, funny, and it jams.","I picked up this album a few years back and recently purchased another copy. This album is full of insights and songs that lift the spirit, cause one to reflect, and occassionaly to bang one's head as one jams to the beat. Steven's Last Night in Town encompasses the spirit of this album. It's a great story, with great music to back it up. This is great music to play while enjoying the company of good friends and relaxing."
5,"Absolutley perfect, a classic, and all-time keeper","I am not a typical BFF fan. My favorites tend to be heavy metal. But this album is brilliant and better than 99% of the metal that I like. This CD made me a die-hard Ben Folds Five fan, and if you are reading these reviews, you will see that the people who give this less than five stars don't appreciate perfection."
3,okay but not great,i liked the songs brick and battle of who could care less and the song for the dumped and kate have a nice beat but overall the cd is depressing and boring. since i got it off a guy for six bucks it was worth it but i wouldnt pay full price for it.
1,Freakingly ugly,This dolls are freakingly ugly. I hate Trollz but My Scene is cool. I hate Trollz. Do you ever watch the Trollz cartoon at Nikelodeon? Bluekkk!!!! Stinkingly boring. I hate Trollz a lot!!!!(...)
3,Confessions of a Serial Egg Donor,"This book was not the most well written book but it did offer a different perspective on egg donation. This book should not be seen as an example of how most egg donors are, as her story is just one (extreme) example of what an egg donor is like. Most egg donors are compassionate women and not avaricious."
4,An excellent read,"In ""Confessions of a Serial Egg Donor"" author Julia Derek has written anemotionally raw and hilariously funny account of her experiences as an egg donor. She pulls no punches and tells it like it is, and the journey she takes the reader on is an immediately engaging, brutally honest one. But Derek's extraordinary clear-sightedness and fabulous, self-deprecatingly dry wit keeps ""Confessions of a Serial Egg Donor"" a compulsive page turner, right up to her very last words."
3,Great Table but a couple of no no's.,"Table is sturdy and good looking, service was very prompt. It rained shortly after receiving and two things that I don't like happened:1. The oil finish doesn't seem to stand up to rain, as it washes off the table and stains the floor, in my case concrete.2. The Lazy Susan stopped moving after I took it out to wipe it off. Tried lining it up on the four mounting screws and had no luck. Looks like I will have to add shims for clearance.All in all these could be deal breakers for someone without tools and patients.I'm not sure what to expect in the long term, proceed with caution."
3,Item OK not quite the quality I expected,The turntable in the middle warped and stopped turning. I had to make some modifications to get it to rotate again. Also the bearing case that it rotates on cracked - nothing t do with modification as I just put rubber riser's in.......Overall OK for now - will see ho it holds up to the weather after more than 6 weeks which is the length of time I have had it.....
5,wow,"now this is a cable. I've never seen a serial cable this nice before. The connectors are easy to connect. The cable is smooth and tightly wrapped, and the color is almost an exact match for the off-white builder's paint on my wall. Highly recommended!"
3,"Riveting plot, but horrible ending","Viguié's writing style was smooth and I had no problems with it. In fact I really enjoyed it. What prompted me to give this book 3 stars was the fact that from the moment Pearl met up with James, I wanted them to end up together, and it was absolute torture for me as a reader when I realised halfway through the book that she wasn't going to be with James after all. And then I started to not like James anymore. Come on, Pearl's been his friend for years and then he proclaims to be in love with Faye just because she saved him?? That's just crap to me. Viguié has not done the characters justice. I understand that this book is supposed to be a retelling, but I have a feeling that the whole story could have ended much better, and in turn, captured the readers' hearts."
3,"Enjoyed the twist, but needed more development","As I've thought with the other Once Upon a Time books in the series, Midnight Pearls could be about twice as long. Overall, I enjoyed the plot and the characters (though Faye and Kale were underdeveloped), but I think if it was given more time, the story could have developed even better. Everything came to a conclusion much too quickly and neatly. I also think the Sea Witch (she didn't even get a real name) was a poor antagonist, because she was hardly mentioned. The ""final battle"" was really missing some tension and action. But, overall I liked the twist on the traditional story of the little mermaid, and I'm glad I read the book."
2,Not what i expected...,"This was supposed to be a re-telling of ""The Little Mermaid"", but it wasn't really beyond the mermaid having to give up something to go to shore. I was much more impressed with ""Snow"" -a similar book in this series that re-told Snow White with many more parallels.Midnight Pearls wasn't a terrible book, but it wasn't very good either. It is written for teenage level readers, in that there is little in the way of descriptive writing. This is fine when it is expected, however, there is still a need for a faced paced interesting plot to compensate for the skimpy writing.I am going to continue to read this series of re-telling of famous tales, and i suggest you do the same.(See ""Snow"" and ""Beauty Sleep"")However, save this book in the series until midnight, so you have something to fall asleep to.Relic113"
5,Fantastic,"Rescued from the sea as a small child during a vicious, ravaging storm, Pearl grew up in a spendid small cottage, with a gorgeous view of the ocean, and the castle in which the King and Prince live in. Pearl is an outcast of her small village, with her pale skin, silver hair, and long, spindly legs in which she is always tripping over. But Pearl's secret friendship with the Prince gives her solace, as he is misunderstood just as she is. When suddenly two jealous mermaid's come up from the sea, with their eyes set on Pearl and Prince James. Now the two of them have to try to stay together, when everyone is trying to keep them apart.A fantastic story, based on ""The Little Mermaid."" Viguie created many lovable characters in this novel filled with fantasy, mystery, suspense, and eventually, a happy ending. A must have for fans of the previous books in the ""Once Upon A Time..."" series.Erika Sorocco"
3,Not Big on this one guys,"This book was very annoying. If you like books with crazy romances this is the book for you. I hated how this book ended. When it was over I threw it at my TV and only touched it agian to put it away on my bookcase. They build you up for one thing and then it gives you another. It was very well written, and general had a very good plot. But most people read these books for the romance in them and not for the plot. It just amazing how someone is in love with some one one minute and the next, they are in love with someone else, everyone is happy, eveyone has a girlfreind or boyfriend, the end. You see I am a fan of cheezy love stories, but this pushes it. I have loved every other book I have read in this series. My reconmendation is that you buy another one of these books, like scarlet moon, the story tellers daughter, or snow. All excellent books. But dont let me stop you. It isnt awful, but decide for yourself, alot of other people seem to like it."
2,It could have been so good!!,"But the author, as the title suggests, ""screwed it up"". The first half of the book is very, very good. But as soon as the two other mermaids come in, the book goes in a completely different direction. One that I didn't exactly like. Both Pearl and Prince James do things that are completely out of character, and it left my head spinning, and swimming with angry thoughts. I could see that the author wanted to have a ""happy"" ending, with everyone left alive; but honestly, I think it would have been better, and more BELIEVABLE if it had been done differently. It could have been very emotional, and powerful; and more satisfying.So, read this with caution. I'm happy that I read it, yes, but ultimately, I'm disappointed in the waste of talent.(edited)"
4,It is wonderful,"It is wonderful and the price is reasonable, I would like to recommend my friends and family to buy it"
4,Tweet,"I am not going to say much. I do like this CD Im just a major fan of Tweet, I love her voice, her personality, everything about her. I wish I would have heard more vocals, the new Tweet im hearing more of that and that is bring out the hummingbird in her. Shes great! I can hear that pasaz in her voice,shes just great. I wish the CD had more of emotion which brings out everything in side, but I love her! Your voice is amazing, I cant wait to hear more from her!"
2,Sorry Tweet,"This album was horrible. I don't know if I expected more from someone who challenged Ashanti (only what I heard through gossip), but the album was not good. (I don't like Ashanti either.) I do believe that she has a nice voice, but come on now. This one is not good.Songs I did like, where 'Oops,' and 'Call Me'"
2,It was alright.,"Tweet is a good singer and all, but her album wasn't all that good. I only liked two songs on the whole CD and those were ""Call Me"" and ""Best Friends"". Plus, I don't really like Tweet all that much because she was talking mess about Ashanti, who is obviously a better singer than Tweet due to her record sales. I expected better, but I guess I didn't really get my money's worth."
2,By God this CD is boring.,"I listened to this CD with an open mind hoping for something but this album bores me. I find this CD to be overrated, and overhyped. Basically the music is lathargic, boring and had that kind of heard that before kind of sound. This CD isn't bad but it's just boring and forgettable. I do give this like a 2.4 for effort in trying to branch out from most other R&B acts but it comes off as uninspring and boring. Sorry but I wasn't really moved."
3,Not bad for a suicidal person.,"It was only a year ago that Tweet was on the verge of killing her self. Thank GodMissy saved her. Tweets album isn't full of wild, crazy, futurist, beats like I though.i'm glad in a way. I like ""Oops"", ""Motel"" ""Boogie 2 Nite""and the two hidden tracks, The ""Oops part 2"" and Missy's song ""Big Spender"". I hope she realses ""Motel"" next"
2,I had a hard time giving 2 stars,"This album is really bad. Save your money. I recommend buying the singles ""Oops (Oh My)"" and ""Call Me"" instead of the whole album.Tweets voice is sweet and smoky, but the songs on this CD are really bad. If she writes her own lyrics, she shouldn't. They're too simplistic even for mainstream pop. I'm sorry Tweet. I hope you do continue to make better music, but get a little more help from the talented people you collaborate with."
1,Disappointing,"""Ooops"" was promising and you think you will buy a promising album in Missy Elliot style. Unfortunately it is very boring, doesn't have any further hit tracks and even the voice is not convincing"
2,Good Effort,"The CD is ok. Well, it's mediocre. I had such high expectations for this CD, as I just love Ooops!. But having purchased both ASHANTI and this CD in the same week, Tweet's CD pales in comparison to Ashanti's release. This CD, Southern Hummingbird, is worth a listen, but I hate to admit, it will probably soon be filed to the middle of my never-listen-to-CD's. It just doesn't hold my attention as well as the first single does."
2,Very Disappointed!,"When I first heard Tweet's first single Ooops (Oh My) I was like Oh My!!!! I couldn't wait for the CD to hit stores, but when that day finally came, I was very disappointed and confused! Since Timberland and Missy Elliott was Tweet's producers, I was thinking the album was going to be full of rock the house beats and catchy lyrics (boy was I suprised.) I had to fight the urge to wrap it back up and send it back the store. I like Tweet, but her first album was garbage, but that's only my opinion! Missy's bonus track is good thought!"
4,Aaaahhh!!,"I purchased this cd after hearing it on the listening party at bet.com I had to have this cd in my collection. I am a huge Timbaland/Elliot fan. I love their work, the people they work with and I thought Tweet fit into their ""family"" perfectly. Her music is refreshing and so relaxing. I listened to the cd from beginning to end and I am so glad that I purchased it. I first heard Tweet on a song from Missy Elliot's so addictive cd. The track, take away. I said, ""wow, I really like her voice"". I only recommend this cd if you like your music mellow. Tweet is in a different category, I wouldn't categorize her as just r&b, she has a neo-soul sound. I love it!!!!!"
4,Sultry Hummingbird,"Surprisingly, with her refreshing sound and her skillful lyrics, Tweet gives us more than many of us may have expected. After the upbeat, head-bangin' release, ""Oops (oh my)"", one may anticipate Timbaland and Missy beats to dominate this project. On the contrary, Tweet hits us with some ole soulful, laid back, slow jamming, lovemaking, sit-back-and-relax type music. The appropriate musical arrangements, refined tempos, and calming vocals mesh brilliantly. You can relax and enjoy the entire CD without your finger on the skip button, except when you get to Missy's closing track. Tweet is more for a mature audience who can appreciate a candle lit dinner and the gentle sounds of a southern hummingbird in the background."
3,Interesting,"Not exactly the album I was hoping for to be honest. I rushed out to get this after hearing her second single, that was enough to make me go out and buy this album.Timberland had that quality sound, which seems all too popular these days.When i bought the album my first thoughts were ""huh"". Track number 2 (the first song) was a total contrast to ""Oops"" and ""Call Me"". Not that, that is a bad thing, but it just didn't catch on with me, nor did the entire album.It has it's ups and downs, but I'm affraid there were too many ""downs"" on this album to make it stand out from the rest."
4,tricky tweet,"as has become somewhat of trend lately, tweet ropes you in w/ a sexy/provocative/""ooh girl, i'm glad i'm not the only one"" tale of performing a perfectly natural (sexual) act, only to immediately hit you with the more mature, grown-up, ""oh my god, i feel just like that sometimes"" material that probably wouldn't go over too well on hot 97. this album is melodious, sweet, emotionally charged, and some might even say inspiring. it's refreshing, and it reminds me of the days when it was okay for women to be feminine and have genuine (love him hard, give him everything, be his everything [and let him be yours] unless he [messes] up) feelings. It's the type of album that makes you want to either fall in love, remember your last true love, or just find a partner (no commitment necessary) who really does it for you sexually."
5,Soulful very creative,I loved this Cd. It was very soulful and creative. Tweet's voice is beautiful. I could relate to alot of the songs especially Best Friend featuring Bilal.T his is definally a must buy if you dont have it go get it. Tweet I wish you all the success in the world you deserve it.
5,Wonderful Album,"This CD is absolutely beautiful! Every song touched me in a different way. It is very memorable and I think Tweet is a talented, classy artist. She has immense talent, both songwriting and singing."
2,A BORE AND MISLEADING.,AFTER hearing oops oh my the thought album would be exciting and similar to that. the cd is very boring i do not like and i think the ashanti cd is better .
1,So Disappointed,"I dunno ... maybe it's me, but I ain't feeling this CD. I am so disappointed. I knew ahead of time that the rest of the album wasn't anything like ""Oops, Oh My"" but I expected sometime a little stronger than this. I will not be running out to get Tweet next time!"
1,Garbage!,"When I first heard Tweet's first single ""Oops (Oh My)"", I was completely tuned in and ready for more. I just couldn't wait for her CD to hit stores, but when that day finally came, I was disappointed and confused. You would think, anybody who works with Timberland and Missy Elliott that their CD was going to be HOT, but Tweet's CD is as cold as the ice cream isle. I like Tweet, but her CD is not what I expected. I had to fight the urge to wrap in back up and get my [money] back from the store."
1,A Mess,"Their was 3 good songs on this album. This album was a hot ass mess, I don't see how people could call this a classic or even like it. Thats why Ashanti SMOKED her ass and now Tweet is nowhere to be seen! Do yourself a favor and buy the hottest album to come out in 2002 and a CLASSIC Contemporary RnB Album in Ashanti!"
3,Tweet - amazing Voice for old style RnB,"Tweet really does have an amazing voice. Her album is nothing like Missy E's so dont expect it to be, but If you get the 17 track version, track 17 by Missy E herself is amazing. If you like the songs and style of this album, there is a RnB artist over here in the UK called BEVERLY KNIGHT, whos new album titled ""WHO I AM"" has such a similar style but unique all the same!."
3,It was O.K.,"First of all Tweet has a wonderful singing voice but the majority of the songs on this CD were just O.K. Ah Hell let me be real, they were even a little boring. I hope her next attempt is a better one"
2,"TWEET-Destined Talent, Disappointing Album","Missy Elliott is a great woman for her creativity and individuality. She does have an eye for talent when it comes her way. But she didn't quite mold this beautiful and unique woman into doing a great and quality album.The album has its ONLY great songs like CALL ME, OOPS...(Oh My), MOTEL, and BEAUTIFUL. Everything else is a ear-drowner. MOTEL is a straightforward song that Tweet wrote and produced that is basically in the midst of confronting a lover in reference to being cheating on. The acoustic guitar sets the mood for the song's tone. It's a great song. BEAUTIFUL is your typical slow song. Tweet adds a jazzy-like flow to it with her sensual, homegirl R&B;/Hip-Hop vocals. Songs like SMOKING CIGARETTES, COMPLAIN, and MAKE YOUR MOVE are just ear-drowners.RECORD FOUR SONGS OFF OF SOMEONE ELSE'S COPY OF TWEET'S ALBUM AND LET THAT BE!!!!"
3,3.5 stars,"I would love to say that this album is flawless, but it's not. Most of the songs are excellent, but some of the acoustic guitar songs are just too weak. The genres of this album are all over the place. Some are very acoustic guitar. Some are Timbaland procuced hip hop and R&B or mindless uptempo numbers. And then some are more neo-soul, organic ballads. Tweet's melodies are nice, but it's obvious that the record label was trying to make her go in all different directions with this album and she should've just chose one."
4,"Something Great, Something New","In this business, its not that often that one get to hear someone with that one special tone, that one certain look, or that certain kind of feeling from one's music or voice. When we do hear such a person that can bring all of that together and make it work thats when one should stand up and take notice cause Tweet is difinetly bringing something different and acceptable to that table. In fact I just witness today an older person buying TWEET's CD and I said that cause I'm within that age group some would say older, but anyway it kind of shock me cause I hadn't heard the entire CD which led me to listen to the samples. I must say I will be getting you CD."
3,I expected more!,"I expected more out of this album. To be honest its a bit boring as a previous reviewer mentioned. I believe it would be good for those depressing moments when you are alone and need the appropriate sound track to go with your mood. I can probably learn to love the album. I guess it will just take a bit to get used to.I loved 'Smoking Cigarettes' and 'Best Friends'among a few.A good enough effort. I hope the next album she makes will be much more interesting cause she's got a refreshing, original voice."
3,A good Start,"Tweet's Album was OK, in the strictest sense of the word. Aside from the songs that are out on the radio, there are maybe 2 or 3 other songs that are cool. Be it known, there are a couple lousy ones also."
4,The Southern Hummingbird....,"Tweet brings a beautiful suol into the R&B; world. Her hits ""Oops (Oh My)"" and ""Call Me"" along with her hidden track #16 give the CD it's boost with hot club beats. Her other songs are more like baby making music but they're good. Tweet gives songs such as ""Beautiful"" and ""Smoking Cigarettes"" a powerful message and creates a feel around them. I am human so I can't say all the songs are the greatest. But I would highly recomend this CD if you like soft R&B.;Best Songs:Call MeOops (Oh My)BeautifulSmoking CigarrettesSexual HealingWorst Songs:""Big Spender"" a hidden track by Missy ElliotMy PlaceBoogie 2nite"
4,This is slammin',"I like this album. I had this album 2 weeks after it was released, and I just started listening to it. Yeah, I know it been 2 years. I like tracks 3 and 5."
4,Good alternative to expensive skylight shades,"I installed these on the inside for 2 skylights in my home. So far, working well. A bit wrinkled but for the price, I can deal with it.This product defiantly cuts down on the heat from the sun, but still lets light through.I see that other reviewers have installed them outside and I'm tempted to purchase another set to go on the outside as well."
2,"A few good songs, but not enough","The platinum CD is a much better purchase. There are only a few good songs on this CD, and not some of the better ones that are alaphet related on Sesame Steet."
1,no,"I think i would have liked it better if it didnt skip on every other song, not a good copy at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"We ""Sing the Alphabet""","I purchased this CD to replace a cassette that finally fell apart after many years. My grandson always listened to it when we were in the car. He was thrilled when I finally found this CD on Amazon. ""Sing the Alphabet"" is a great oldie but goodie learning tool for little ones."
3,good but difficult to understand sometimes,it's hard to understand sometimes when Elmo speaks with his baby voice and the way he sings. My kids keep asking what he said.. all the time. may be need to take some time to get used to it.
3,It should have been better,"Backstage certainly could have been a great expose on the Dean Martin Show, but instead it become a sanitized version of things most people already knew through the tabloids.For someone initimately as close to the Dean Martin Show as Lee Hale, you almost get the impression he wrote a book simply to pass time (or make money). Dean walks in and out of the book almost as a passer-by...letting Hale spend most of focus on the Golddiggers.Periodically you are given a peek at Dean's complexities, or the peculiarites of some of his guests, but it is evident that Lee Hale was very careful not to offend too many of the ""big stars"".""Dean came in...sang along on a song...Dean left"" no big deal---too bad, I'm sure there was a great deal more that could have been said about the show if the author obviously didn't want to be so politically correct. It should have been better."
4,Respighi connection,"Note that the first track is clearly related to Respighi's Ancient Airs and Dances. I don't know if Respighi drew on Uccellini directly or if they both have a common source, but the relationship is unmistakeable. The Antal Dorati recording of the Respighi suites is quite good."
3,Good book.,"This book gave me a good general impression about the Seychelles before and during my trip. It doesn't describe themes deeply. It's ok for a reference guide, but won't tell you about prices, tips, restaurants, hotels. However, the map is very useful. I'd suggest Lonely Planet series for deeper perspective."
1,"""Classic Environment"" is code for ""It won't work on Macs anymore""","I didn't realize that. I am a new and exuberant iMac user, and was eager to play Quake 2 on my system! Other experienced Mac users may know this, but I didn't realize that the term ""Classic Environment"" is Apple code for ""It doesn't work on Macs anymore."" So instead of a game, I have a coaster."
3,Old style fun ...,"... if you can find a machine on which to play. My all-time favorite of the Quakes was III Arena, just because there was no storyline, but this rocks, too."
5,It Quake 2 come on,If Unreal was not quite your thing but you like this type of action game or if your looking for a little no bot action this games for you. Multi-player is a bit lacking but then again their Quake 3 that is better in action and multi-player. But Quake 2 has a very good story and the flys are so much better than Unreal.
1,Definitely NOT made in the USA,"Although this brush worked excellent after two showers...the wooden handle actually cracked almost in half, making it unusable. I was soo disappointed! I absolutely loved the frizz free shine and velvet feel it gave my hair, gripped hair well, too! ...The dream brush...or so I thought? I would love to have another brush, but for the price...I can't justify spending the cash, if the quality of the brush is inferior...My mistake, I accidently threw away the receipt...this company does not have a ""good"" return policy either....Buyer Beware, Keep Your Receipt, and Read Return Policy by Seller... :) Good Luck if you decide to purchase, like I said brush works wonders...best I ever had...for 2 blow drys! Btw, I have short, super fine, thin hair...it normally take about 4-5 minutes to blow dry with a round brush...it shouldn't have broke...I wish it hadn't as well."
2,"Good acting can't save cliched, shallow script.","This will be brief - as the body count rises, what might have been a suspenseful film becomes numbingly repetitive. The characters are types with very done to develop them (and make us care about what happens to them.)The direction is no more than adequate - the two stars are for the work of the actors, who are all good with very thin material.Pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of your time (and it seems longer!)"
2,One of Bobby Darin's worst movies--but not his fault,"This is one of Bobby Darin's worst movies, but he's pretty much an innocent victim here. In the first half he's given a lame comic relief role, which he tries to breath life into like a trooper (no pun intended). Then in the second half even that lame task is taken away from him and given to Bob Newhart.In both halves Steve McQueen pretty much steals the show as other reviewers have noted. Even with McQueen's powerful presence though it seems like a directionless and pointless effort.Strangly it was one of Darin's most successful films at the box office."
3,Quality time,"""Hell is For Heros"" is a well made movie. The story is good and McQueen and the other actors do a good job. It is not exceptional. I like ""The War Lover"" better."
4,Standard war film,"The Bottom Line:Hell is for Heroes is a fairly well-made but thoroughly standard-order war film about a platoon of disparate characters pitted against the enemy: if you like the actors (a young Steve McQueen, a very young and amusing Bob Newhart, James Coburn, et al.) or really crave WWII check it out but if you don't then I doubt you'll find much to differentiate it from the thousand or so other films just like it.3/4"
3,Steve the Soldier,Steve in fine form as a rugged loner trapped by Germans with a few of his fellow dogfaces. More like a tv show than a movie because of the cheap set and low-budget look of the whole film it manages to sail along holding one's interest with lots of dramatic interest by scenery-chewers like Bob Newhart doing a long comedy shtick somewhat peculiarly in the middle of the film. This movie did a lot of good for McQueen's career and helped cement its status as a classic of the genre.
4,An interesting film,"I tend to shy away from WWII movies made from the 40's till the early 60's, because they lack a certain realism. This film is one of the first, however, to break out of that ultra-patriotic, propaganda ridden era that Hollywood defined as World War II. Within the censorship limits of the time, this movie shows warfare at it's ugliest. The film follows a squad from the 95th Infantry Division as they face the Siegfried Line in the fall of 1944. The filmakers have researched the technical aspects of the film fairly well. The G.I.s are correctly uniformed and equiped, which is somewhat of a rarity from Hollywood at the time. ( Unfortunatly the Germans in the film are not so lucky. They could have used a better tech advisor.) Overall a good movie. Someone must have gained inspiration from it when they made the movie WHEN TRUMPETS FADE in 1998. Very similar story line and just as well done."
3,Bobby Darin shines in this above average war drama,"A taught film with an unusual ""life contiues"" ending, Hell Is For Heroes is able to rise above the level of many war films, particularliy those of the ""buddies against all costs"" genre. Steve McQueen is his solid self, James Coburn turns in an impressive early performance and Bob Newhart makes his debut in an excellently played supporting role. The real gem to be found in this film however, is the often overlooked acting talents of Bobby Darin, who for those out of the loop did later garner an Oscar nomination in Captain Newman M.D. An excellent performance which manages to showcase his ability to handle humor, drama, and action with realism and ease. All in all, an above average war flick with a taught, well paced story, solid cast and unique finish. Hats off to Bobby Darin!"
4,Great,"The movie is one of the best WWII movies I have ever seen, it always had my attention. Steve McQueen was perfect for his role. This will reign as one of the greatest war movies."
5,Hell is for Heroes I love,I like the story line. Is easy to follow. and identify with the different people and what they go through. I love SteveMcQueen. He is a good acter.
4,It is Steve McQueen,"It is Steve McQueen. Need anymore be said. It is what you would expect from a 1960s Steve McQueen movie, action, etc..."
4,DVD Prices are Hell Too!,"These prices are getting out of hand. Their are no extras on this dvd and it retails for almost $30! This is a $15 release, and that's being generous. I will hold out to find it on sale or  used. Yes this is a terrific movie and it introduced me to Bob Newhart's style. For now, I'll watch my vhs copy.Please understand I want the most for my money. For under $30 I've bought; The Abyss, T2, Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia. And these were ALL 2 disc releases! Last month I bought The Magnificent 7 for $13, it has a 1 hour documentry, 2 trailers, stills and a very enjoyable commentary with Eli Wallach, James Coburn plus others.Well, I'm done venting.Brian"
5,A Must have for knitters,I received this book as a gift a couple of years ago and showed it to another knitter friend of mine who is a new knitter. It only took her a few minutes to see that all the questions that she had in mind and we had discussed about knitting was clearly explained in this amazing book. This particular purchase was for her but I think it is a must have for all knitters of any level.My personal copy of this book is on my nightstand and I review something in it at least a couple times a week.
3,You might want to keep looking...,"Wow. Surprised to see so many 5 star ratings. I started knitting about 10 years ago, mostly without any nearby mentors. So I had to shop for a book early on to find out basic necessities. Ended up buying this one because it seemed to have the most content. And it does have many techniques listed. However, I found then, and still find now, that the descriptions and diagrams can be very difficult to understand. I still occasionally need to consult an expert source, but I usually first look for a video online. If I can't find it there, I consult my books. This one is more like a last resort, but sometimes I do find what I need here and muddle through."
4,a definite must,"the knitter's handbook is a great reference for both beginners and more advanced knitters. i learned so many new techniques for every phase of the knitting process, i can't believe i got along without this book before. if you are interested in learning something new, look here. the only complaint is that some of the instructions leave you to goof around to understand them; they could be a little more clear. in general, i love this book and would recommend it to other knitters."
2,No a Beginner book...,"Illustration and words do not explain clearly...Sometimes, it's just short words...seems like the writer too lazy to write down all the information...and assume that the readers will (or already) understand themselves...it's not a really-really handbook...i think it's more like an information book...a handbook should be clear, not just complete..."
2,The book is fine- annoyed that Amazon sent a damaged copy- twice!,"I am a Prime member and chose free 2-day shipping for this item. The first copy arrived badly bent (this is a large, thick paperback) and poorly packed for shipment. I exchanged it for a replacement. The second copy was also poorly packaged and damaged as a result. Frustrated, I returned the second copy for a refund.This is a great knitting reference book but I finally gave up on getting it from Amazon directly. This is a book to add to a knitting reference book collection and there is a no excuse for it to have been damaged in transit.I realize this is not a product review per se but there is really no way to directly complain to Amazon about this. Free shipping for Prime members should NOT mean shoddy packaging."
1,Leaky,"This was cute, great for night time thirst, except it leaks CONSTANTLY. It is also hard for the kids to push the faucet to dispense water. Contacted the company, still waiting on an answer for a solution"
1,Overnight Forecast: Precipitation Expected!,"This little water dispenser is cute, but it LEAKS at a rate of 1 oz per hour. If you plan to leave it at your desk overnight, you should either take the bottle off or put it on something that won't be harmed by wetness."
5,"""Old"" Realities","Realities by Liz Clayborne has updated it's scent and I don't like it as well as the ""old"" Realities. I'm so glad to be able to purchase the old fragrance which is a beautiful scent!!!"
5,Realities by Liz Claiborne,Great product and price! Hard to find in local stores. Delivery was almost 3 weeks but worth the wait unless you are in a hurry.
3,Smells Just Like I Remember,"I ordered two of these and one was leaking when it arrived. It smells just like I remember, but I'm not sure the fragrance lasts very long."
3,Amusing ancient artifact,"There are funny moments in ""Peace,"" which in itself is remarkable since this comedy is 2400 years old. The opening scene is hilarious as we learn that Trygaeus's plan involves a giant dung beetle from the slopes of volcanic Mt. Etna. His interview with Hermes is also quite funny.The previous reviewer has related the plot. Very few twists and turns here. As in his better-known Lysistrata, Aristophanes is interested in bringing peace to the warring Greek states. Except for the beetle, this comedy is less inventive than Lysistrata and generally less provocative. Very much a lesser ""world classic."""
4,Pertronix Bosch 1847A Ignitor,The unit was in good shape. I've gotten better for less but the performance is better than points so I just hope it lasts longer than my last Pertronix ignitor
1,no go,"The Pertronix Ignitor 1847A does not come close to fitting my Bosch 231 153 009 distributor. I was thinking there may be something wrong with my part number, because the Pertonix number looks like their picture. I searchedand found a picture of my distributor on Hot Spark's website with part numbers that match mine and a conversion kit that fits. (Its in the picture,fitting) As I said before, the Pertronix kit isn't even close.This brings up another Pertronix ignition kit I put in recently. Kit 1843 in a different model Bosch distributor was close, and after some modification, it worked. Someone at Pertronix ought to try their partsfor fit and function. By the way the installation instructions were wrong also."
3,Stefano Benni's minor work,"Stefano Benni's books have brought by a significant change in the tendencies of italian fiction in the last 20 years. He has pubblished many novels, short stories, poems, theatre pieces etc. Sadly, ""Terra"" is probably his worst book, and this according to many. His best novels present an incredible originality, both in linguistic form (following a tradition spanning from Gadda onwards) and in contents, with humorous pieces but also moral instances of great depth. Benni represents without doubt one of the best italian writers of the last years, and he must be by no means mistaken for a cheap satiric sf-writer. Other (better) novels I can suggest are: ""Comici spaventati guerrieri"", ""La compagnia dei celestini"", ""Elianto"", plus the short stories ""Bar Sport"" and ""L'ultima lacrima""."
5,Super Harry and not the Potter one,Excellent book that has charmed 3 generations of kids in my family. Always a delight. Excellent gift for children aged 4-8.
5,Classic,Nice to see a favorite book from my childhood in board book form. My child loves dogs and this book is already a favorite.
5,Just a great little kid's book,"This is the first of the Harry series, of which we have three. All of those books are consistently good quality, rather similar (Harry gets into trouble, there are misunderstandings, everybody gets along fine in the end). This one is very appealing and our boy asked for it many many times, until finally (after a few dozen readings over a period of many months, ages 1-2) he got a little bored with it. Highly recommended, one of our favorites."
5,Harry,I love the Harry the Dirty Dog books I wish there were more than just the fourBooks.That's all I have to say.
2,Bad message to child - running away from home is fun!,"The book is cute overall, but is ruined by the fact that it puts the idea of running away from home into a child's head - and that it could be so much fun to run away! I also don't like the ""playing dead"" part - don't really like introducing the ""dead"" concept to a child."
3,To wash him is to know him,The book I read was Harry the Dirty Dog. I like this book because of the illustrations. The dog in the story is cute. I also like the plot of the story. The dog doesn't like to have baths. He runs away and gets dirty. He is so dirty his family does not recognize him. Finally he begs for a bath and gets one. His family realizes it is him.
1,No pictures,I can't believe I wasted my money of this children's books without pictures are worthless when trying to teach a child to read. I want my money back!
2,Kill me with a blunt instrument so I don't have to read this again,"The book is a classic; I guess it's ok if you like the 50's era storytelling and basic story lines, including the idea that ""black"" is ""dirty"". But really, the book is fine.Unless you have to read it 5,000 times because your kid fell in love with it. If you're the parent of a toddler, you'll know that repeatability is a huge trait for the parent's enjoyment factor and this book DOES NOT pass the test. I have essentially hidden this book from my child because I am so tired of reading it. It becomes uninteresing after about the 10th read, and downright gnawing after read number 100.Otherwise, I'm sure it's fine. :)"
5,Big favorite of mine since childhood,"Of all my childrens books I believe this was one of my favorites. Currently I am sharing this one with my niece. Do I love dogs? Yes, I have 3, 2 beagles and one dashound. They all love to get dirty but could do without baths!G Kroon"
5,Bath night book,"This book is our daughter's favorite book to read on the nights when she has a bath. We love all the ""Harry"" books. ""Harry the Dirty Dog"" is a timeless and clever story."
4,"Orion VIII, Orion VII ist schon futsch!","This is definitely a ""Rücksturz in die Vergangenheit"". If you grew up with this then it is a cool thing to get. You cannot compare this to Star Trek.... but still, the space ship is way cooler that the enterprise."
5,Great Movie Everyone Should See,"Great early career performances by Harrison Ford, Kelly McGillis, Danny Glover, Lukas Haas, Patti Lupone. Was talking to my daughter about old films she should see, and this was one on my list. Great suspense and love story, culture clash, and comedic scenes, understated performances. Unique scene in the barn dancing to a cover of Sam Cooke's Wonderful World."
3,Not so hot,"A big city cop (Harrison Ford) is charged with protecting an Amish woman (Kelly McGillis) and her son (Lukas Haas)--naturally, the sparks fly. Can anyone say ""high concept""? I was far less impressed with this film than most people were, although I would not say that it is a bad movie. It is somewhat slow and obvious, and McGillis's character, Rachel, never behaves believeably as an Amish woman. She is much too quick to dance and squeal with Ford in the barn, not to mention the scene in which she exposes her naked body to him, inviting him to fornicate with her right there in her father's house. It entertained me, but I have no desire to see it again."
3,Could be one of his most liked movies.,"Time will tell if Ford, known as heroic Han Solo and Indy Jones will return to his heroic status. It is hard for me to realize that when push came to shove and Ford was asked to support the pro-Sadam leftist in hollywood or our troups he blinked. He has been known for his financial support for Clinton, and thats fine. That is the way hollywood is. But support for proping up sadam?... and then he had his publicist try to explain away his apparent anti-american pro-french quotes...Anyway, my point is that Harrison Ford is arguably out best actor today. He plays the hero roles and the human interest roles very well. If the public stops accepting him as a hero, due to his politics then his excellent work in movies like WITNESS will come to dominate. I liked this movie, but it is not currently my favorite Ford movie. Maybe that will change over time."
3,"GOod, but no as good as some people say...","This, along, with ""TOP GUNS"", is one of only two movies by McGIllis that are famous. After that, she almost disappeared from screen (maybe in in theater..) Ford is good, but the village to where the boy belongs is made of boring people, full of prejudice. The suspense is very good."
5,wonderfully rememberable,I have watched this movie over and over (since i own it on tape) and love it. The portrayl of Amish life is very close to actual Amish life. The drama and forbidden love between Book and Rachel is memorable.
3,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT IN PICTURE QUALITY,One of my favorite Harrison Ford movies! I had the older version in my hands numerous times but I told myself there would be a better transfer someday so I waited. It finally happened BUT when I watched this version I was really disappointed- The transfer itself is a pretty good one but it looks like there was no restoration done! The picture has white spots all over the place. THE MOVIE SHOULD LOOK BETTER THAN THIS-It's only 20 years old and they have restoration software now for this exact problem!THIS IS A CLASSIC MOVIE and deserves more attention than was given. I hope this is not the final version of this movie to be released!
4,FINE UPGRADE OF A TERRIFIC FILM,"The main new thing about WITNESSS Special Collector's Edition (Paramount) is the nearly feature length documentary Between Two Worlds: The Making of Witness in which producer Edward Feldmann, director Peter Weir and actors Harrison Ford, Kelly McGillis, Patty Lupone, Lucas Hass and others reflect on their personal lives, the story itself and the artistic process in the minimalist, retro world of a Pennsylvania Amish community.William Kelly's fresh and powerful story, with it's multiple meaning title, combines a murder mystery and a doomed love story when a world of darkness and evil is dragged into an oasis of peace and love via a detective investigating a killing. This 20-year-old film is a timeless and beautiful story, wonderfully realized with an unusually effective score."
5,witness,"Harrison Ford always dose a good job. The movie is action-packed,and shows life between Amish and others. It is a good movie to see."
1,"DVD ""Witness""","This video had extreme sound differences. (Loud, then soft) I had to continually change the volume. When I returned it as defective, I only received a partial refund because ""it had been opened."" I would like to know how I could have determined it was defective if I didn't open it!!! This is my last purchase from Amazon if that is the policy!!!"
5,Classic,"The story is excellent...and I think it's one of the few movies that shed a little light on the lifestyle of the Amish. Granted there are many different sects and such, but many of us have a small degree of fascination with the Amish because of how secluded they are. The music and scenery in general also do a lot for me. Witness and Hoosiers are the only movies that come to mind that I would love to watch in the fall, with tons of leaves on the ground, the windows open and dusk just starting...it's a mood thing with these movies Heehee!"
5,Superb Police Thriller! Succeeds on many levels at once!,"This movie is inmensely entertaining, with a great script and great acting (which earned Harrison Ford his only Oscar Nomination). The film succeeds as a romance, drama and police thriller. The action-packed ending is great and the forbidden-love relationship between Kelly McGuillis and Harrison Ford is provocative. Very realistic and entertaining. This is a real winner!"
5,Harrison Ford and the Amish people.,Interesting story here. Detective hides out from the bad guys in an Amish community. Lots of romantic tension between Ford and Kelly McGinnis.
3,"Well acted, different location with a familiar plot","What always baffles me is when a different subject matter is brought to the screen it is always treated with awe and reverence and the Amish people are not better or worse than the rest of us slobs. Even though they live here use the resources in this country and intermarry as they please but refuse to fight for ""their country & way of life"". To bad the rest of us morons get get a deal like that."
1,How Bizarre!,"20th October 2008. I have been asked to review this excellent DVD - which I ordered on the 9th of September, 2008. I would love to give it a resounding thumbs-up of a write-up but, sadly... I have not received it yet! Come on Amazon, tell your left hand what your right hand is doing!"
3,Pretty good but not that great,"I liked the Amish theme but the story could have been stronger. I always like Jan Rubes .who does a good job as Kelley McGillis's father. I also have some difficulty watching films that have a romantic theme where one of the stars, in this case, McGillis, is an announced homosexual. It makes it difficult to suspend my disbelief."
5,TERRIFIC,"A young amish boy (Lucas Haas) witnesses a brutal slaying. Ford is the cop assigned to the case and turns protector. A superb blend of police thriller, culture clash and romance; funny, suspenseful and exciting. A solid script, strong performances (including one of Ford's best) and a fine music score just add to the class set by director, Weir. Superior entertainment. Watch for Viggo Mortensen in an early cameo. 4 1/2 stars."
4,Witness,"I was satisfied with my purchase, but I would like to know how to choose a DVD, in the future with Spanish subtitles. I'd appreciate your help with this."
3,Great story,"The film is less about Harrison Ford learning to live among the Amish as it is the Amish learning to live with Ford. He is a man who at first glance has no matching ideals. The film is fantastic on that level, especially thanks to Peter Weir's direction, who brilliantly shows Ford gradually becoming accepted by the Amish men.There is very little dialogue among the characters, and Rachel (McGillis) talks even less, not because she doesn't have anything to say, but because Amish rules of life don't seem to allow her to. They are presented as a quiet people, so McGillis has the difficult task of making Rachel speak without dialogue, and she does it well, which carries over to Ford (he got an Oscar nomination, she didn't).It's only at the climax of the film, when the action takes over that the film begins to weaken. The filmmakers seem to have some kind of answer to how the killer's storyline should be resolved, but it's not very good."
3,It is well written but...,"When I finished seven chapters I wanted to ask Amazon to refund my money! Hardly a page goes by that the authors don't tell me that I am just too dumb to handle this mess without the help o f a professional estate planner..so go ouot and hire one of our profession. It may cost you an arm and a leg, but it is better than giving it to the IRS!"
4,Good children's book,"I liked it a bit better than my daughter (10), but she still wanted me to purchase it."
2,If you want to cry,"I thought this would be a cute story about trees, but it is quite sad. I felt myself welling up towards the end, and my daughter sensed that. So with that, she cried and I spent the the eveing comforting her. Granted not a good bedtimme story. Sorry I don't recommend."
5,A Powerful Book About Loss -- Whatever Your Age,"This is an incredibly sweet and moving book about loss -- for many of the reasons others have mentioned, and for other reasons that can not be put into words. This book gets as the heart of this matter in a way few books have. I have read this book to one or both of my kids at least a dozen times and even though I know exactly what will happen I cry every single time I read it. This book just knows something that other books don't."
5,Emotional for the tender-hearted,"My almost-four year old and I loved this sweet book, but I should warn you that it literally brought him to tears. While I certainly got a lump in my throat as I read the passage about the storm, my son started sobbing. It took 10 minutes to calm him down. Strangely, though, he wanted me to read it again! (I didn't, as it was time for bed.) Anyhow, enjoy, but have a kleenex ready!"
5,Must have for your children's collection,"This story is so sweet. The pictures are very well-done but the story is the focal point and it shines. Not much else to say as it's in the description, but the kids really enjoy this book and I don't mind reading it over and over again. It would make a nice gift as well."
5,A sweet story,My daughter loves this book - especially the picture of the dog with the underwear on its head. She's four and really gets the story. It's short and sweet with a nice little message.
4,Wide-angle chair,"Chair is smaller than pictured.Wide-angle photography seemed to have been used.Otherwise,it seems to be a good product. Wooden legs are very attractive."
3,Purchased for new home,"I bought two of these chairs. They are cute but are small. It seems they are not made for the average adult but they are very nice looking and comfortable...if you are very petite. A 6"" Ft. man would not be comfortable in these chairs."
2,Good but cushion is too thin,The description says the cushion is 4 inches thick. That's not true. It's less than 2 inches and veru firm.
5,Ultra fast shipping,"I bought two of the wicker chairs. Appear to be sturdy, a bit stiff, but I do love the design. The cushion is 2"" thick. Happy with the purchase."
5,LOVE,"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, these chairs! Can you tell I love them?"
4,Does the trick!,This chair is easy to move around & looks nice. Great for seating smaller people. We use it as one of the chairs around our fire pit. Cushion is kinda thin but not totally uncomfortable. We are satified as it serves the purpose we bought it for.
5,have owned since 2008,"** 8/12/2012 -- i just clicked on the link for these chairs and was reminded by amazon that i ordered these in 2008. wow! time flies but these chairs have held up incredibly well. as a matter of fact, all the strathwood furniture we have still looks very good.we have the regular chairs (no cushions), the table, trash can and a couple small side tables. all have held up incredibly well with only the wood legs showing any wear. even that is minimal as our furniture has baked in the southern california sun for over 4 years. i have the beige cushion covers too. i think i've washed them a handful of times, but they also look good. no tears. and they sit in the sun all day. everything is being put thru the wringer here at our place, and is holding up really well. the trashcan hinge is the only thing that has broken. the hinge, not a quick fix, however; doesnt really effect the use of the lid. so still big thumbs up on all products."
4,good,This is a required text for a class I'm taking. It was what I ordered. This book is interesting.in not like this was an item you buy to wear or to use for what ever. It's a required text for a class and it is easy to read and understand.
2,Highlighting,Has a lot of highlighted text. Other than that the book is in good condition. Didn't come as quick as I expected it to.
2,Disappointing,Like Michael Dulin but this CD was not what I expected. I was hoping for a more uplifting Christmas CD.
5,Get ready to pass the test!,"Having reviewed the book, I found it well-organized and well-written. There is quite a bit to learn. The authors distilled the facts in a way that the material makes sense, preparing the reader to not only pass the exam, but to retain a cohesive understanding of the new features of Oracle 8i."
2,Disappointed this time around,"I was very let down by this book, especially after being satisfied with Freeman's Oracle 7.3 to 8 Exam Cram edition. I urge extreme caution to anyone who believes this 8i Exam Cram covers the minimum material required to pass the exam.Maybe I'm a bit rusty but I spent over 80 hours reading, reviewing and practicing tests out of this book. I passed all the sample tests therein with a very comfortable margin but was not able to pass the REAL TEST. Inaccuracies are one thing but the major omissions really killed me. Examples include specific subject matter related to LOB columns, partition joins, explain plan, Dimensions, post-8i CONNECT command, v8.1.6 features, transportable tablespaces, etc.The book isn't a complete waste of time. I'd recommend reading it once, rather quickly. It obviously needs to be augmented by other study material, as I'm getting ready to find out."
2,"Eddie Bauer Luggage 21""","I really liked the design of this luggage and the size etc was perfect, until the cheaply made part in the handle broke with just a little use. It has a poorly designed part in the handle that activates the telescope portion of the handle that can break with just normal use in a fairly short time then the telescopic handle will not go up or down."
4,The turtle says it all!,"The turtle says it all. This anthology brings Cuba to the eyes of its readers, in many forms and colors. It portrays the beauty of Cuban imagination while introducing it readers with an array of authors. Voice of the Turtle is the perfect book to introduce people to Cuban literature."
4,"Great toy - For Girls, too!","I bought this truck for my daughter, because she seems to like playing with mini cars/trucks. She really loves this toy. She drives it around the yard & play area - whether it is hauling dirt or her 'My Little Ponies', she is bound to have fun! The rake, shovel & helmet are perfect for her, too. And if you are wondering if it is durable - like the original TONKA trucks... The answer is YES!! My daughter sits in the bed of the truck, and pushes herself around (backwards) in it, and so far, it has held up! I highly recommend this truck for any child 2 1/2 years old (or older)"
5,Tonka Mighty Dump Truck with Construction Helmet,I bought two of these for my grandchildren. Its a great value as I compared prices to local retailers. Little boys will spend hours playing with them.
3,Not great for young child,"My ratings are based on using this toy for a 1 year old. I love Tonka toys, so when I saw this truck on sale, I bought it. I didn't think to myself that I have a very young child who perhaps could not use it well, but that turned out to be the case.The truck is metal with rolled edges and very hard plastic. Perfect for an older child, and will stand up to years of hard play ... but not so great for a little one who is still a bit wobbly."
3,Not bad,There was a lot of good descriptive writing as far as settings in this book as well as some excellent characterization. The only thing that was really lacking was the storyline. It wandered around so much that the ending almost felt like an afterthought. This was the first book I've read by this author and I'll probably be back for more.
4,Definately a pleasant addition to anyone's CD collection,"After hearing a few of their songs for the first time today I decided to buy the CD. It has a somnolent, yet portentous sound to it and also a great uplifting tune.So treat your senses and get yourself a copy of their latest CD!"
3,Simple piece of equipment.,"I purchased this input/output selector because I was looking for an inexpensive one of these to switch in between my video game systems.It's kind of lightweight plastic and the packaging looked like something that I could have bought at a discount/dollar store, but it seems to be doing its job. I had to be careful inserting the A/V cables, though, because the inputs were a little loose."
4,"Great Lyrics, Great Sound","Ginny Owens' second album is much like her first. It has very meaningful lyrics and a great sound. Her voice and instrumentals make several of these songs very catchy.The two songs that I like the best on this album are 'With Me' and 'I Am'. The first one has a solid message about God being with us through thick and thin. It doesn't matter what is going on, He is there. The second contains a strong point about God being able to use all of us, no matter what our weaknesses or inadequacies. She traces the stories of Moses, David, and Mary in making her point.If you have not heard Ginny Owens, you are in for a treat. I recommend this album along with 'Beautiful' and 'Without Condition'."
5,Wonderful!,Cute and entertaining! This book was a breath of fresh air. I absolutely loved it and have recommended it to my friends. I can't wait to see more books by this same author.
5,It Sparkles,"Audrey Valeriani's first book is a gem: whimsical and entertaining. It made me laugh and it made me think. Gigi's illustrations and Audrey's words are upbeat and engaging, a perfect fit. This little treasure is just in time for the holidays, a fun gift for a man or a woman... Give us more!"
4,"Cute, great illustrations.....",Good advice for those of us men that know all the wrong moves! Great illustrations from a Dear Freind of mine!
2,Set up and let down,"Despite a wonderfully detailed and nuanced backround of future tech and society, the author's central characters are tossed aside before the end for other peripheral characters and the reader is provided no conclusion or explanation as to who was responsible, what the resolution was of all the problems created except for one, and that survival seemed an afterthought. Although the action captivated me, I was extremely frustrated at the end because none of the questions regarding the key characters were addressed. Whudunit? How did it happen? Will they be caught? Why was it done to them? Just a silly girlfriend kind of final scene that sucked."
2,Nothing Original,"Although there are some interesting concepts in this novel, my overall impression is ""nothing new."" The nano and cloning treatments are light weight versions of Bear, Morgan, Brin and others. If one is looking for science fiction dealing with these areas, choose other books by better authors."
3,Wishing for more in the next -,"I enjoyed this novel but it needed better plot development. It also seemed like the author had so many good ideas (that could have been stories in their own right)that he cramed them all into one book.I feel that I would read another book by the author and find his ideas fascinating. Any next book by the author would just need better cohesion, focus and a more plot driven story line. In this novel everything never really comes together, and when you reach the ending you leave the book wanting more answers."
4,Great debut and a fun read,A great story set in a rich and vividly imaged world. Story gets a little frayed at the end but is all around a fine read.
3,"Bizarre, Rambling","Actually, all I wanted to say is in my review title. It's bizarre and rambling. The only sympathetic character starts halfway through the book. The central characters are generally weird, but fresh. It kept me going, but I read the audiobook version, so it was a little easier to keep going, y'know?"
2,I wish I could say I liked it ...,"After reading so much praise for ""Counting Heads,"" I was disappointed to find that it doesn't live up to all of the good press. Despite a number of excellent ideas, the lack of any real plot or likable characters ultimately dooms the book. Beyond the first section, I struggled to find a reason to continue reading. Although, the writing was excellent and I was constantly wowed by Marusek's descriptions of future technology, I just wasn't interested in what was happening."
5,A regular guy review on Counting Heads,"I am not a professional book critic. I am a book reader and collector so I will not intellectually break the book apart. However, it you enjoy reading about new ideas, concepts, and about new environments that may be possible in the future of humans...this book will enlighten you. This book is not a fast read, it is one that takes time to absorb, taking in this new language in this world that Mr. David has developed. I believe his first book is just a taste, a quick visit to a world that has many stories to unfold, many lives to reveal. I am looking forward to the next visit. Best wishes to you, Mr. David.Erich, a regular guy in mid-Michigan."
3,"Great start, disappointing end...","When reading books like this I wonder sometimes if the publisher told the author: ""I don't care how the book ends, just give me no more than 350 pages!!""The book develops well with interesting concepts, good action and great flow, then derails to a sudden ending with some major issues left open (I won't give away the plot here). I've seen this time and again, and I wonder if maybe there was a page limit on the book, or perhaps the author has had enough and wants to hand in the work?I'm not a writer, and I know it must be rediculous to have one's work criticized by someone who has not been down the same road, but I have invested money and time in this work and have to say that although it was a good read, and solid entertainment for a few days, it will not stay with me the way other books in it's genre (Diamond Age, for example) have."
4,A nice little book,"Although it's compact, this is a sweet little book and well worth having. Full of wisdom, advice, and lore, it can fill out your herbal or magical library nicely. Charming!"
4,g-force controller is a RIPOFF!!!!!,"i got this pos for xmas 2003 thinkin it would be better than any other controller... but i was wrong. my friend let me barrow 007:nightfire and i played it and every 5 mins. I had to re-plug it because the calabration kept screwin up! and i bought 007: everything or nothing when it came out on feb 18. i brought it home thinkin how cool multi-player was going to be. but eversince i got the game i havent been able to expeirience it BECAUSE THE POS CONTROLLER WOULDNT EVEN WORK!!!!! plus it wouldnt work for MK deadly alience.... so if your planin to get a controller, say on this website... DONT GET THIS ONE! i would just get a normal one because an incodent similar to this one happened with my supper pad 64.... so do the smart thing and get a normal controller and actually ENJOY playin your games."
1,"works fine at first, but now turns off console when plugged in","I received this third-party controller for Christmas in 2005 with a 32-meg memory card, and at first the controller worked just fine. After a few months, it started to turn off my Gamecube automatically when I plug it in. I thought my console was busted, but I was wrong. I took it to another fellow student at school and informed me to never trust third-party Gamecube controllers and go with genuine first-party ones. The memory card still works fine today unlike the faulty controller, and they were both made by the same company. Go with first-party controllers, but please stay away from third-party ones even if they are cheaper. It is most likely a scam of quantity vs. quality."
4,Intec controllers suck!,I had a controller and it lasted about 2 weeks. My Uncle bought an intec and it lasted 2 days! I have a pelican wirelass and it's been dependable so far. stay away from intec!
4,Great size and reliable,"I've purchased two of these controllers about four months ago and they are still working perfectly. I play Madden, MVP Baseball, 007 EON, Tiger Woods, Mario Sunshine and more. NO PROBLEMS HERE! I'm an adult and I don't bang, beat or slam my controller on the ground or wreckless with it. Maybe that's the problem for the other users who rated this as terrible. Because I am an adult I love the bigger size this controller offers. The normal Gamecube controller size is for baby hands and I just couldn't take it anymore. I recommend these even more now that they are 10 bucks!"
3,I cant believe it,"(...)I bought this controller at BlockBuster and tried it out. I think it's the kind of controller that's for people with GIANT hands and who can lift a couple hundred pounds with their pinkies. It is huge, and I let my friends use it ;). So thats why i've won our PATHETIC games of Super Smash 2."
3,"For this price, it should look more elegant. I am disappointed...","The face design is fine. What I really disappointed is the color of the so-called gold-tone case. It looks totally different from the picture on the Invicta's web site. It looks much more like checp looking bright copper, not even close to 14K gold color. For $1350 MSRP, Invicta should pay more attention to the detail. The print quality of the manual is really bad too, but instruction is clear.The date indicator is too similar to minutes indicator. It should have different pointer or color.The brown leather band is too thin. A $600 ORIS watch comes with much richer looking leather band.Forgot to mention, the watch comes with light yellow heavy box. I wish it come with elegant wood box for its' style.It doesn't look like a $1350 watch at all, not even a street priced $599 watch.Invicta try to make it classic and elegant. In my opinion, they have failed."
5,switchbox cable,This was key to linking our switch box in our two printer set up . So glad they had it in stock!
3,"Ordered 2, 1 arrived damaged","Ordered 2, 1 arrived damaged and unusable. That is a 50% quality rate. It's probably not worth my time or money to return it. It's going in the trash."
4,"Don't know what you guys are talking about, but..","I just got the box from CVS store. For $21, it's a little....steep...but I keep over $500 inside the box(I'm working a summer job and trying to raise cash to buy a car) and no problem(s) yet. The box smells good, it's small, hard, cool looking, easy to set the code, it just really good if you want to store money. All in all, I like it. Maybe the 1 stars reviewers just got a bad box."
2,"Nice box, cheap lock",The box seems nice and sturdy. The lock was difficult to use. Once we set the combo it opened the first couple of times with difficulty and then would not open again. I tried to contact the manufacturer for assistance and did not receive a reply.
1,"So Secure, You Can't Even Open It!","I just got this product. After several minutes of fiddling with the combination lock, I finally tried a screwdriver to pry the darn thing open. Even that didn't work. One thing is for sure: It is so secure that nobody can get to your valuables, not even you! I was eyeing a Vaultz locking CD storage case, but seeing the quality of this combo lock, I would not entrust my CD collection to it, or any valuables. DO NOT BUY."
1,Worked for a while,"I used this box successfully for a few months, but then I changed the code and have never been able to open it again. I'm absolutely positive of the code I set but the thing will not budge. Also this box does not come with the security cable that's pictured with this item."
1,Wonderful until you set the combo and then can't open it.,"I thought I'd go with the combination lock for more security. Yep, it's so secure that you can't open it! Luckily nothing is locked inside of it, but definitely do not buy this cash box."
3,It was needed,"I needed a cash box quite badly and this one has the following going for it: it's inexpensive, sturdy and discrete.Word to the wise: if you don't need a particularly nice cash box spend less than $15.This is not impossible to walk off with. I had to hide it AND put the lock on it AND keep it locked."
3,"Great concept, cheap construction","My son received this as a gift. He absolutely loved it, but it broke wihtin a few weeks of use. First the actual sorting stopped functioing properly and then the handle used to turn the crank broke off and all was lost. We had to throw it in the trash."
3,Sort-a-Cheap,"Our (almost) 4-year old son thinks this bank is pretty cool. He liked helping put it together and now likes to show anyone who'll watch how it works. I watch this all with trepidation, as it is clear from the cheap plastic sorting mechanism that this dinosaur will soon become extinct. That said, it will have been fun while it lasted."
3,a fun sort a saurus,the sort a saurus bank is a fun easy to put together bank but it breaks very easy.
2,Below Average,"This is a workman like effort by the author. The story, spy vs. spy is not a new one and you will not find anything memorable here. I did not believe the characters; they just were not well developed. The author also tried to go down the path of the ""dark, brooding"" lead and he did not pull it off. Overall, this is not that great of a book"
5,cab-55 5 string bass,"I'd been looking for a 5 string acoustic bass for practice and playing around the house.I didn't want to pay for a lower end bass that needed lots of work out the box. I took my time and ran across this one.The stuff I read about this one all looked good.The price was great and so was the bass. The action is nice ,low no fighting it to play. B string pretty good as well, tight not floppy. Body of the bass is thin very easy to hold and play. Lastly the electrics in the bass sound great and work just as well. For the price and the value I don't think you can do better.I've beed a bass played for over 30 years now I own and play 14 basses 12 electric 2 acoustic.Thank you for your time I hope this was of some use to you.Practice,Practice, Practice, you can do it if you try."
4,great sound,first off guys you need a amp for any componemt speaker set up when you see rms power get a amp that is close to the highest number for rms. with out a amp you are wasting you money.
5,Odyssey,"After having read nearly all of Maalouf's books, this is one of his best. (Samarkand remains my favorite.) Odyssey is an appropriate word in the title. The protaganist makes a journey and quest with real philosophical issues. This is a Candide story, with skepticism. It is hard to put the book down at night when reading. Balthasar faces many challenges both in his quest for the book, and in love, but also about life. The reader feels for his concerns. One of the nice details is that whenever he came to a town/city he looked for and visited the local booksellers, this was in 1666. His companions on his journey help him struggle with issues. This is a book about fate and life and well worth reading."
5,Great Histrorical Fiction,One of his best books.... and a joy to read. You feel as if you are part of his caravan or sitting next to him on a boat. Highly recommended.
1,Viair onboard air kit 20052,"Very disapointing, poor fittings, on off switch should be momentary, tubing unstraightenable, comes with pressure switch that can't even be used with a system unless an air tank is purchased (doesn't need an air tank), does not come with a pressure bleed down, wire furnished is actually good and long enough. If you are building an on board air system for air bags don't waste your money on this kit, buy separate components of good quality and save some money. The way Viair advertises the kit you really don't have a way of knowing what you are really getting."
1,European model camera,"Found specs on this camera at Olympus Europe web site. Basically it's a 4 MP camera with 3x optical zoom & 4x digital zoom. 1.8 inch color monitor.4 scene programs: Portrait, self-portrait, night scene & landscape. White balance is auto & sunlight, overcast, tungsten & florescent. 4 flash modes. Image processing is True Pic, pixel mapping, noise reduction in night scene mode, function shooting is 2 in 1 & panorama. It also takes movies but without sound, I think. Still image edit is re-size, rotation, sepia mode & black & white. This info. is highlights of what the average person would need to know to evaluate this camera.Lots more is on the web site. I've e mailed Olympus to get information on sales in USA but no response so far. No evaluation on Steve's Digicams either.Hope this helps. Rating at one star since I don't have any experience with this camera."
2,Alarm feature is poor,"I don't really understand the alarm function on this product. You simply push the center button to start the alarm, but if someone is attacking you all they have to do to shut the alarm off is once again push the center button. Seems to easy to deactivate if you are being attacked."
3,"It's good, depending on your use . . . .","I bought this for my Mother, who was in the last stages of cancer. She was mobile but fell frequently or needed my care and I wanted something that would get my attention wherever she was or I was in the house. It was perfect for this as I could strap it on Mom's wrist so it was always with her, it was easy enough for her to activate and it was loud enough for me to hear it from any room or at night while sleeping. It was a lot better for my needs then a baby monitor or a bell, as Mom was not always near them when she needed me."
4,Sense of Security,"I have had this product for a year and a half, and it makes me more confident when running alone. I also carry mace. Should anyone try to bother me, the alarm is loud enough to at least scare someone since it would draw attention. I use the light, too, when running in the dark. I like this product!"
3,Spoiled by Rebecca,"If I had read this before reading any of Rebecca's ""Housewives"" books, I might have rated this higher. Don't get me wrong, the pictures are first-rate, but each drawing is also accompanied by what appear to be preliminary sketches of it along with some text which apparently serves as some kind of set up for each drawing, so you're really only getting a book half full. Be warned."
4,A good start.,"Simple and basic, this book is a good platform for learning about first responder duties. This book is an easy read and could be completed in less than two days.I would recommend this book for the small town officer,recent academy grad, or the experienced officer who may a little out of touch."
3,Was a little disappointed,"The book is ""okay"". I guess I was expecting a little more than just a couple of words on each page."
4,It is a steel rod,"Hard to mess up a half inch threaded pipe! Functions as intended. It is as nice a threaded rod as I have installed before. Pretty silly, but Amazon wanted a review so....."
2,"Good plot, poor execution","Cait London has potential, and it shows in this novel. However, she needs serious work on her execution. The plot is good, even if it isn't exactly unique. The romantic tension between the two main characters- Marlo and Spencer- is intense, and I was looking forward to seeing where it went. However, I couldn't make it past 200 pages of the book, and even that was a struggle, because London's writing style is seriously lacking. She uses awkward dialogue to explain every detail about the characters. This alone kills the novel. People in the real world do not speak even remotely the way the characters speak. I can accept a few uses of unrealistic dialogue to explain background information, but every other sentence in this novel is more awkward that the previous.If London had instead used descriptive writing to explain background info, and had focused on using dialogue to actually say something important, this would have been a decent novel."
1,Sloppy Boring Mess,"This book was hard to get through. I finally skipped 50 pages to get to the ending. Something I RARELY do. The characters were a mess. I found myself wanting to smack the two main characters. The story came to a near halt numerous times while Margo and Spence went through a series of ""would of, could of, should of"" discussions. Secondary characters were flighty and one dimensional. Overall a lack of communication, stilted dialogue, and a truly boring story that just dragged on and on....UGH!!!"
5,Great fun,My family loves playing board games and this is one of our favorites. Teams respond to a prompt and then compare answers with their partners. While you can play the game competitively it is also just fun and interesting to see how different people's thought processes work. I have bought this game twice because the first one went to a party and never came home.
1,utter waste,Music for the black trenchcoat and dog-collar crowd. Spooky? About as spooky as playing Resident Evil but less satisfying.I want my money back.
4,A Healthy Dose of Motivation.,I found the cd set to be refreshing and thought provoking. Listening to the cds was like reviewing segments from a host of motivational talks covering uplifting topics all packed into one neat package.
4,Brat does it again!,"Her second album is very nice. She continues to deliver phat rhymes on this album. This CD is not as good as the first, but it still is a classic and a must have."
2,"Man, what a disappointment","Da Brat dropped this album, Anuthatantrum, with a rapid-fire flow that quickly silenced all the haters who said that she was biting Snoop Dogg. It's too bad that not many quality songs result from this formula. Nearly every song is about getting lifted and challenging wack MC's and nothing else. And if you read the liner notes, EVERY song ""contains a sample from"" such-and-such. I misplaced this CD and wanted to look for it for only two songs: ""Lyrical Molestation"" and ""Live it Up"", giving a nod to Biggie and Akinyele, respectively. Also, she had the nerve to end this album at 34 minutes like she did something devastating."
2,Don't last very long,I used them in a very small room and only felt like they were providing me with delicious vanilla aroma for around 4 or 5 days. They aren't the most cost effective air fresheners I've ever bought.
2,YAWN,"Baraka was so much better and after I watched the interview at the end ...Holy Cow, what a self important $@!!#% (You fill in the rest.)"
1,The DVD was hacked.,"I've seen the ""explanations"" put forth by the spokespeople. They don't make sense. If you saw the film as originally presented, or, like me, you happened to own an old home video version of this film, you'd be outraged. The MGM/UA version of this film is hacked. The ""letterboxing"" is artificial. I could create quite a list of wonderful things you AREN'T SEEING in this DVD version because of the artificial black bars covering the top and bottom of the screen. This can't be right. I loved this film. The new MGM/UA DVD is just wrong. The single star is for this DVD version. I wish I could give the five stars this film deserves, but I can't. I can't watch the DVD because it ticks me off. I'll just fire up my ol' Laserdisc and see the WHOLE film. ...And wait for a full-screen version of the DVD to come out so I'd have to buy Koyaanisqatsi AGAIN."
3,Seems to blame us,"Our world is indeed out of balance because there are too many people, but this film seems to be sending the message that it's our fault. It isn't. Nature made us this way and now we have to pay the terrible price of overpopulation. Koyannisqatsi says we are to blame. The truth is much more terrible: we are victims of nature."
5,awesome,"people are always skeptical until they see it. it's one of those ""Jaws""-type movies that you can watch whenever. this is a must see film."
1,"ok, its life out of balance--so?","Ok, its life out of balance--so? Thats all? The producers show their education and title is--lfe out of balance--so? Its been out of balance for 6000 years--are they trying to say their college degrees and Harvard diploma worth nothing? Well, I knew this for some time. In short, producers manage to find money for producing and distributing their movie and repeated things that been well known for 6000 years, So?Get a life! And dont bother me with nothing. Yes, because you are big nothing."
1,MGM DVD is cropped from the fullscreen version,MGM lost a class action suit in 2005 for 500 DVD titles which were cropped into widescreen from the old 4:3 fullframe image. This is one of those DVDs. I'm sorry I bought it and will buy a replacement as soon as the original version is released.
3,DVD aspect ratio,"I know this discussion and these comments are years old, but since I just discovered this ...While I do not doubt that Mr. Beirne is correct that the theatrical version is what the director intended, I found this site's comparison of the DVDs to be very enlightening:[...]The most disheartening part is the clearly inferior sampling rate of the MGM DVD release compared to the original IRE DVD. The clarity in the IRE images, compared to the MGM images, is startling. Also, seeing both aspect ratios directly compared, it seems obvious to me that the images were very much composed with 1:1.33 in mind, if not exclusively for it.Personally, I think the composition of the images in that ratio are superior, but the poor sampling rate of the widescreen version makes it hard to make a fair comparison.rd"
5,Under-rated by professional reviewers,"I caught some of this film on Film Four TV in the UK Christmas 1998. Since then I have been trying to find a video copy, in spite of most of the reviews in the film catalogues giving it mixed ratings. By chance I saw that it was showing with a new digital soundtrack at a prestige cinema in London for 7 days,and saw it on 5 August 1999. The cinema was perhaps 20% full! All those empty seats for such a great film. I can only think the reviewers haven't actually seen it and are regurgitating some other review. This is undoubtedly a five star film, even if you don't subscribe to the Hopi sentiments. Maybe the video will now appear."
5,Koyaanisqatsi was a life changing experience.,"I saw Koyaanisqatsi for the first time two days ago. My life will never be the same. The images, the music, the implications, will haunt my heart for all eternity. My new mission? To find a copy of this masterpiece and spread it's beauty to others. Koyaanisqatsi is not a movie - it is not a documentary - it is not a indie - it IS a crucial piece of the puzzle that, when solved, will lead mankind to enlightenment."
4,Excellent Film,Very different and artistic film. This film is an excellent example of telling a story through other means than those used in conventional cinema today.
1,An abomination,"This film is a tumor. This film is the ultimate expression of everything wrong with ""art"" films.This is the ultimate triumph of ""message"" over substance and story.A million dollar compendium of glorified stock footage that ends with a slow view of an exploding rocket ship that seems to almost mock the deaths of those involved.This is a film illustrating pure and utter contempt for human life that exists beyond a primitive tribal state.This film is Anti-Life, its like art made by the friggin Anti-Spiral.If you think this film is good, and not just parroting the usual tripe of modern film criticism, if you think this film is good by your own honest opinion you are either a sociopath or a hipster. Or maybe you were just mercifully misinterpreting into something less soul-crushingly bleak."
5,Words fail,"This DVD brings out only one word for me - masterpiece. Before I saw it, I would never have believed any movie could evoke a clearer picture of our troubled existence - and this does it without a spoken word. The music is unbelieveable - Philip Glass did a tremendous job and the director made a wise decision actually cutting some scenes to fit the music; something I cannot imagine most of todays ego driven directors would even consider, let alone condone.This piece should be mandatory viewing."
3,"Dazzling in its time, disappointing transfer.","This movie was hot stuff in 1983. It still dazzles and stuns at times. But...- It was not properly remastered: it shows scratches, and some of the images are washed out.- Also I find the ""accelerated human activity"" parts overlong, and the music that goes with them, disquieting. I prefer the slower, ""hypnotic"" parts.I didn't feel that way when I first saw it (about 10 years ago, not 1983, so TV, not movie theater). I guess I've become more critical. Though I would have found scratches and desaturated images unforgivable when I was 10. I'm not saying don't buy it. Just set your tolerance level a bit higher."
4,Powerfull scenes,"What to say about this ..? As background, I can tell you that I am in the late 70's listened a lot of Philip Glass, and then even Einstein On The Beach and took note of the theme, which of course there is doom the novel On the Beach by Nevil Shute.Koyaanisqatsi is a powerful but in many respects confusing history the destruction of which man becomes too great for himself and threatens to destroy the world in its zeal for efficiency.Powerful scenes and superb music offering this movie on."
4,Growing Into Timelessness,"Sure these guys could be classified under modern/alternativerock, but there's more here than that; it's verging on the timeless. And they'll surely get there with future releases.But for now this CD will more than do; it rocks, it's melodic,and is full of unexpected surprises. The production and engineering is great and always appropriate to the artistic intention. This is essential listening and deserves to get national exposure."
5,Great Album,"Just a great album in all aspects. Jon B's gonna be here for a long time. Definitely my favorite male Rand B artist. He makes music that the girls AND the guys can listen to, something that's rare with male R and B artists. The song with 2Pac never gets old. Can't wait for the next album."
5,DON'T SLEEP ON THIS CD (IT'S A MUST HAVE),"I'VE BEEN A BIG FAN OF JON B. SINCE ""THEY DON'T KNOW."" MY INTENTIONS WERE TO BUY THIS ALBUM A LONG TIME AGO BUT I JUST BOUGHT IT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. I WISH I WOULD HAVE NEVER SLEPT ON THIS CD BECAUSE IT IS SO GOOD. THE SINGLES WERE ""THEY DON'T KNOW,"" ""I DO,"" AND ""R U STILL DOWN"" FEAT. THE LEGENDARY 2PAC. ANYTHING BABYFACE TOUCHES BECOMES A CLASSIC; HE KNOWS TALENT WHEN HE SEES IT. ALSO, CHECK OUT ""PLEASURES U LIKE"" IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE SO; ""DON'T TALK"" WAS A SINGLE FROM THAT ALBUM."
2,His First Was Better,Don't make the mistake of just getting this CD just because he is fine. Are You Still Down and They Don't Know are the only good songs on here. Your better off with SINGLES!
1,very formula,they don't know was okay.but overall he is factory product.he ain't no Darryl Hall that's for sure.he is a ok writer.but just like his first disc it seems that the Genius of BabyFace is pulling the strings.
1,"One Star for ""They Don't Know""...none for the rest of the CD","I loved ""They Don't Know"" which is why I bought the CD...MISTAKE. The CD lacks any type of creativity and as far the lyrics....Can we say ""Dumb ?"" ""Trite ?"" People with lyrics as trite as the ones on this CD should not have them written on the CD. Try again Jon. Maybe next time you'll have 3 good songs on your CD."
5,Sexy voice and Great sounds,I love this Cd. I fell in love with Jon B's voice when I first heard this Cd. It relaxes you and helps you to think about romantic memories
4,Quick service,I like this cd. I have 3 favorite songs on it. I have had to replace this cd three times. I was very excited to have this cd so soon. GoHastings shipped this item on Saturday and I rec'd it by mail on today (Monday).
4,THE RETURN OF BLUE-EYED SOUL,"After seeing Jon B's video on BET, I decided to invest in his new CD. This was the best $13.00 I have ever spent on a CD. His tracks are smooth and upbeat. When I close my eyes and listen to the words, he fills my heart. Just as other blue-eyed soul singers (Teena Marie, Hall and Oates, Bobby Caldwell) Jon B has been widely accepted in the African American music community. Hopefully, his music will be able to cross over and he can become an even bigger hit! Big-ups to Jon B!"
5,Jon B is one of the best singers out there AND THAT FOR REAL,HIS SONGS ARE JUST SO SO GOOD AND HE KNOW THAT.I LOVE ALL OF JON B'S SONGS.
5,Too Hot!!,"Jon B. is a very talented Artist, I always compared his style of music to Babyface, but...his style of music is his own, and I can't wait for his next album to come out."
5,One of the best R&B albums released in 1997,"For Jon B's second sophmore album he enlisted the help of the late Tupac to give him a single the hood could appericate which was Are You Still Down. Are You Still Down had a grown man hip hop feel to it as in the video both men were dressed in suits. However the ballads are the strong department on the CD. Cool Relax yieled two huge singles which were They Don't Know & I Do (Whatcha Say Boo). There are also some excllent album only slow jams which just as easily could have been singles which include Pride & Joy, I Ain't Going and Love Hurts.Cool Relax was an enjoyable disc. The music, production, tunes, and songwriting all converge and result in an alluring, romantic, and bracingly modern soul."
5,Bigger size = better Scrabble!,"There are some things that just seem impossible & improving the game of Scrabble is one of those things (yeah, my family's obsessed with Scrabble). But a bigger board & some extra letters actually did enhance our Scrabble experience! Plus it makes the games last a little bit longer (which we love around here)! If your peeps are Scrabble fiends, don't think twice: yes, you really do want bigger Scrabble."
2,Quality of product is disappointing!,"I was looking forward to receiving this product, for I dearly love Scrabble and was looking forward to the bigger board and extra tiles. However two of the tiles were broken in the bag and had to be glued back together and the tiles are thinner then the regular Scrabble tiles. I was also spoiled by my daughter's board where each tile fits into a molded plastic spot when a word was being created. That way the tiles don't slip around when the board is moved."
5,Super Scrabble Review,"After playing regular Scrabble for years with my mother we were intrigued and excited to learn they had come out with a larger version. We immediately jumped at the chance to purchase the new game, as we will sit for hours at a time, day after day playing Scrabble. The Super Scrabble takes longer to complete a game (normal Scrabble is approximately a 30 minute game for us). It is also more challenging as there are twice as many of most of the letters, especially the ""hard to use"" letters; i.e. Z Q J K V,We were very happy and satisfied with our new game.Thank You,Candace S Pickeral"
4,Super Scrabble is Super Fun!,"My boyfriend and I are Scrabble addicts! We play every night. Super Scrabble is so much fun. You have twice as many letters, spaces and scores. The board features 441 spaces vice 225 on the original. There is also the addition of quadruple word and letter spaces. We love it and now our friends as us to bring it over too. If you love Scrabble, you will love Super Scrabble. Warning: Games take twice as long."
4,Great Game for Scrabble Lovers,"Super Scrabble increases the fun and difficulty of Scrabble. I warn potential buyers, however, that this game is NOT for a quick and fun evening. An average game can consume large amounts of time.Quadruple work scores and an expanded board size are two elements of this game.One star was deducted because each game is a little bit longer than I would like! Just a matter of opinion."
5,Very Nice for the price,I just love playing this game with my wife... The board is sturdy and hence there is no problem while playing.... It has the quadruple score too....Will recommend it for sure to all the beginners !!!
4,FUN,Fast shipment. Game is very fun and makes a lasting game with the extra tiles. It would be nice if they came up with turn style board for this super version.
4,"Good Game, but go for the DELUXE","I love Scrabble! This new version is wonderful! More tiles, More premium squares, Higher scores, More FUN! If you always wished there was more space to the left, right, on top or on bottom of that word you could capitalize on ...your wish has come true. I recommend getting the Deluxe version because having the board with the grid makes it easier to keep the tiles in place. Other than that, I say this newest version of Scrabble is the BEST. You'll love it."
1,Unusable board game,There are no indentions on the large board to hold the tiles in place as they are played. With a board that large and that many tiles after a very short time it turns into a tile skating rink with a great deal of time spent trying to keep the tiles in their original position.One game was enough.We will never use it again.Our present standard scrabble board has an indented surface to hold the tiles in place and had we known that the new one did not we would never have considered buying it.
3,Not for the faint of heart,"The good thing about the original game of scrabble, it lasts just long enough so that once everyone starts really getting sick of it, you realize the grab bag is almost empty. This game is a lot like a marathon. When you feel like it should be over, you realize you're not even halfway done. Everyone doesn't want to build around the triple word scores because of normal Scrabble phobias, which means you have a very center-concentrated game in what needs to be a very spread out game. Don't expect to want to see the people you start this endeavor with for a couple of days afterwords, as tensions will be high by the time it is over..."
2,Takes too long,I love Standard Scrabble but Super Scrabble has gone too far. The games last forever which is frustrating when you play in a large family gathering setting. The marathon games make it easier to come back from being behind but everyone I've played with is just bored at the end and wants to get the game over with. Plus the board is flat and when knocked the tiles jumble up. Extra frustrating when you have been playing for hours.
3,Scrabble lovers,"This is a great alternative for Scrabble lovers, but it does take about three hours to play. It's great to have more than one Q,Z, etc. to really challenge those who like this word game. We've been spoiled by the deluxe set which keeps the tiles in place and the swivel board; would recommend they come up with a way to include this as one bump could destroy hours of play!"
3,Super Scrabble,"My Super Scrabble game was delivered very quickly and well in advance of the Holiday. I appreciated the terrific service. I am, however, very disappointed in the appearance of the game board. The colors are very light and dull in appearance unlike the colors on the two regular editions of the Scrabble games that we own. The board colors on the older editions are vivid and robust. They provide more contrast, and we are better able to read the wording on the board."
1,A disappointment,"I sent this book back because I found the advice mostly rehashed 1950s style advice to women to do whatever your man ""needs."" There wasn't much advice for men here except to pretend to listen to her, grin and bear it when she wants to talk about the relationship. Pretty grim."
5,The best rap group no question about it!,This is one of my favorite albums Cypress Hill rip s..t up on this album the best song is the 'Boom Biddy Bye Bye' remix I will never get tired of that . 'The Hits from the Bong' remix is good to and yes everyone does want to get high
2,too noisy,purchased in 2009. the whirring from the tee is just too loud. and you really need a lot more balls to make this fun. we used it just as a tee most of the time.
5,Great Fun & Versatile!,This is a lot of fun. I have to admit we have even used it inside our family room (Don't tell!). It has 3 different ways of using it and is fairly easy to set up. I wish we had more than 3 balls and will have to look into ordering more. The adults like this toy as much as our 3 year old does...or more!
4,Tee is too high and too weak,I have a three year old and he knocks the tee off the bottom. It is also too high for him--the tee is at his armpits. I played baseball in college and it is higher than the tees we used.I like the balls. The bat is fine.
4,Fun,"Got this for my son about 18 months ago, just before his 2nd birthday. He enjoys it (yes, I do too), but prefers it when I pitch to him.It works as advertised, but it would be more fun if it came with more balls (it includes 3). We spend far more time retrieving and loading the balls then swinging the bat. You can buy extra balls at the manufacturer's web site, at a reasonable price.Overall, it's a fun toy and worth the price.BTW, we have a big loft apartment and no yard. We've only used this toy indoors. I don't know how it will stand up to being left outdoors."
3,Age appropriate,"I bought this for my grandson and he enjoyed it. It is not real sturdy and came apart easily. It worked well but didn't hold up as well as I thought it should. Good seller, great communication and fast shipping."
3,fun but fragile,"it basically doesn't work any more. sure we left it out in the rain once, but aren't kids toys supposed to survive that insult? it was fun for a very brief period of time, but i guess what was i expecting for the price. it would also have been nice to know how to get similar balls or if it worked with wiffle balls or something like that. but the balls are specially sized and i could never find any other ball that worked with it."
2,Doesn't hold up to 3 year old play....,My three old grandson played with this using the middle level of pitching balls for about 10 minutes when the batteries had to be replaced! I was very disappointed in it's quality.
1,Not worth the purchase,"I bought this for my son with visions of t-ball in the backyard, lemonade, good ol summertime fun. Well, that didn't happen. The Balls are too heavy, pitching feature pitched it like 3 inches so unless your child is a Thumballina twin forget that. The batteries lasted as long as it took to take it outside, get really frustrated, and go back in. Really. My son did use the t-ball stand. Once. It's too low for him. So if you ant a t-ball stand for young young child its ok. But the pitching feature and balls theselves are a waste. All in all, just save some dough and get a 5 doller t-ball stand. If you need it to pitch get something else alltogether."
4,fun for the ages,This toy was bought for my two boys ages 5 and 3. Being able to adjust the aim works well for their different stages. Both boys enjoy this toy and it is great for working with their coordination. My only negative comment is that I have found it difficult to find replacement balls.
3,So incredibly noisy!!!,"This ""toy"" sure gives my pitching arm a rest and keeps my 2 year old busy chasing the baseballs and reloading them. BUT oh dear lord is this thing ridiculously loud!! I can't hear myself think to type this review! Outside toy for sure....and even then I thought about taking it back."
5,Need extra balls?,I just wanted to post that if you need extra balls all you have to do is call Fisher-Price and give them the Product Number and you can purchase the balls right from them.And here's all the information:Fisher-Price - 800-432-5437Product Number - B6312They come in sets of 3.
4,a great way to learn to hit a baseball,"I bought this toy for my grandson's 4th birthday. He loves baseball and really enjoys this toy. He likes to have the ball pop up rather than use the toy as a tee, but he does sometimes use the tee. After he hits the ball, he runs around the yard, then picks up the ball and starts over again. I think this is a wonderful toy to help train a child to hit a ball. It saves the parent from having to stand their and keep throwing the ball to the child. I definitely recommend this toy for any child (boy or girl) who loves to play baseball!"
3,Kid Stuff,"Great for indoors, but batteries run down too fast and it works intermittently. Not consistent. Needs a different power source."
3,kind of not what it looks like,"kind of loud and motor seems a little under-powered. only 3 balls included so i guess you have to go and buy some more as they'll inevitably get lost or go into a neighbor's yard. also find yourself in an almost perpetual job of re-filling the loading tube. otherwise, this is for the closest to 3 year old age group and not the 5-7 year old group. all in all, a good starter set."
3,It's okay but live pitching is better,You can use it as a tee or to have it pitch to you. I bought it thinking that my boy would use it to practice by himself without needing me. That is not how it worked out. I still have to be there to help him with it to make sure that it is shooting at the right angle so that he can hit it. Once we do find that sweet repetitive spot then were ready to play ball. My boy hit better with it being pitched to him as opposed to being used as a tee. With the latter he mainly hit the tee instead of the ball. That is attributed to more of his skill level than the product. He was four years old at the time. Perhaps now that he is older he may be able to use it better. Overall my feeling is that he is better suited off with me pitching to him.
3,Pretty Good Toy,"This thing works as well or better then expected, do yourself a favor & order an extra set of balls from Fisher Price as other reviewers suggest. Id give it more stars but being made in China it loses appeal for me."
4,Good for hitting practice,It is a good unit. We had it indoors just for our 4 yr old to see it and it is very noisy......definitely an outdoor toy.
4,Fun game!,"I bought this for a children's event. It was a popular game, but the balls take too long to pop up. It also would be better if it came with more balls but other than that it was a great success!"
2,Refund Please!,"I purchased this for my 4 year old's birthday based on all the positive reviews. After I purchased 4 D batteries, I put the thing together, with a very eager 4 year old by my side. What a bummer it was to have it put together, and have it do hardly anything. The baseballs were very, very slow to come out. Not to mention this toy is LOUD! But back to the actual function of this toy. It's horrible. The balls are slow to come out, if they came out at all. Or perhaps one will come out, but then it would turn itself off. It also appeared to shut itself off if the 4 year old was too slow to add the balls back to it. Overall very disappointed with this, and it's going back."
2,Returned it quickly,"I don't usually do reviews, but wanted to help others avoid a potential mistake. Purchased this for my wife for Xmas from Costco. 1st one had a stuck button, so had to return it. 2nd one I got was Very unintuitive on screen menu with very poor documentation. No AC adapter, so only way to charge it is through the car charger. The maps themselves look ultra low tech with jagged lines and odd color schemes. On a trip from Orlando, system locked up and had to be restarted. Very cheap plastic feel. Only positive I found was a very good GPS antenna - always had a strong signal. Returned it back to Costco. Probably will look at Garmin 660."
3,"Good product, poor support","Overall I like my Magellan 3050T as a roduct. It has saved me a lot of time & gas in finding addresses and routing around traffic. I recommended it to everyone, that is until I had to deal with tech support to get an out-of-date map upgrade.Despite all of the promises, they don't call back, they'll escalate to supervisors who don't exist or don't care, and no matter how much data you give to Navteq about errata in the maps Magellan devices use, the updates and POI updates they provide will always be at least a year out of date. I've owned mine a little over a year and have been reporting all sorts of corrections, but the new data is still a year old so the corrections aren't in there.My advice: find yourself a non-Magellan, modern GPS which can speak the names of the streets and yet still can grab the traffic updates."
2,I returned mine,I did not care for it either because the maps were outdated. Bought my unit from Costco and took advantage of the return policy. When asking for the closest walmart it said it was in another state! Although I know how close my local one is. And there are many similar examples. That is the main reason I returned it. Also when you take a wrong turn it takes it a while to figure out where you are and to reroute you often making you panic when on the road bc you are not sure which way to turn in the meantime.
2,Too Bulky,"The craftsman ship of this case is just fine, the quality of the leather is fine grained and buffed to a medium polish -- so how come I don't carry it? It's too bulky. The case is padded which makes it nice to touch, but with my Palm IIIc inside it's over an inch and a half thick which makes it a real handful and not why I went to a PDA."
1,Leaves a lot to be desired,I got this case because I am one of those people who is still attached to having paper and a pen/pencil. While it does have room for a small tablet this causes the case to be too tight on the PDA and as a consequence it is always on. Adding credit cards and other forms of ID exascerbate this problem further. There is also nothing to hold a writing utensil in place. There is one elastic loop meant to hold the stylus and nothing else will fit.I finally gave up and went back to using the case that came with my Visor.
5,This is a must for lovers of guitar solos!,"You'll hear these Christmas classics done in a way that makes them sound fresh and new. Joe Satriani's rendition of ""Silent Night"" takes you to some other world. He took a beautiful classic and created a vibrant emotion."
4,Interesting and fun.,"If you are a fan of guitar solos, BUY THIS ALBUM. Never mind that it it Christmas Music. It is fun. I first heard it in a store, and had to get it. I haven't been disappointed."
5,Christmas for the soul!,"You don't have to be a fan of guitar for Steve Morse's ""Joy to The World"" to run chills down your spine, or for Richie Samboras Cantique De noel to bring a tear to your eye. And if you can keep from dancing to the Brian Setzer Orchestra's Jingle Bells then you're stronger willed that I. This is Manheim Steamroller to the Nth degree! And don't get the idea this is raw screaming guitars. These are musicians giving it their all and it will leave you in awe. My compliments to Stevie Vai for putting such a fabulous Christmas celebration together!"
5,Merry Axemas,A great performance of traditional Christmas songs played by some of the worlds greatest guitar players. A must have CD to play alone with traditional Christmas CD's during the Holiday season!
4,Great CD,"Got this CD about a year or two ago....very awesome! Impressed with most of the guitar players on this Christmas montage album. I love to play it all times of the year! However, Steve Vai is my only real complaint, I feel he butchered the song, I can't stand listening to it. Silent Night Jam was really out of place as well. Everything else....keep rockin around the Christmas Tree! (kinda surprised that wasn't on the CD though.)Highlights:Eric Johnson, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Joe Perry, Jeff Beck, Brian SetzerLowlights:Steve Vai, Satch"
2,Awful to read,"I hate this book. It is not a very smooth read. My son loves the illustrations so I make up my own story if he insists on the ""moose book"". I bought it based on the other reviews but I don't enjoy reading it at all."
2,A Book About What You Already Know.,"I found most of this text to be kind of a waste. I'm an interemediate experience hiker but there's nothing new in this ""bare bones"" basic book. Even if I was just getting into the sport, I would NOT have learned anything that VERY basic common sense couldn't already tell me. ...I have found much more valuable information (and more accurate as well) on this same topic from more comprehensive sports medicine reference titles."
1,James is too full of himself..,"Parts of this book, esp where he discusses the aesthetic value of cricket are tolerable. Otherwise, most of the book is about trying to tell the reader what an intellectual James is. I'm afraid this book is less about cricket and more about James. He's too full of himself and that diminishes the value of what could have been a great book.Also, the writing leaves a lot to be desired."
5,This cd is AWESOME!!,"I really wasn't very familiar with G.Love when I bought this cd based on the recommendation of a friend. I am blown away! This cd is very original, skillfully crafted, and just plain fun!"
1,Disappointing,I love Jack Johnson & this was recommended when I purchased one of his albums. After listening to the samples thought I might enjoy this but I have to say it sits in my cd collection and collects dust. I have tried listening to it several times to be sure but it just doesn't do it for me.
1,truly disappointing...,"i saw g. love live a while back, and thought that they were okay...however...the cd disappointed me greatly...it was unimaginative, puerile nonsense...let's hope g. love reaches it's potential someday soon..."
4,Dark Apocolyptic folk,"Camerata Mediolanense is a collaboration between members of Ataraxia and Ordo Equitum Solis. Reigning from Italy, the group bring in a dark renaissance-type feel complete with pounding drums and harpsichords. For anyone who likes early Moon Lay Hidden Beneathe The Cloud would appreciate this or anyone looking for some good Pagan music."
2,Another unusable anthology,"The editor of this book is a great critic but this is the second time he has proved himself to be a woefully incompetent anthology editor. The first was his 'The Penguin Book of Modern Verse Translation', a collection of wonderful poems , whose translators could only be discovered by consulting crowded contents pages, and which had no indexes either of poets or translators.In the case of this anthology of Homer translations, Steiner given us his scholarship and endeavour in finding numerous translations, many of them obscure and ill-deservedly forgotten, but his publishers have failed to give the book a proper apparatus. They have also not persuaded Steiner to give the book the editorial input it requires, in particular an explanation of the otherwise arbitrary choice of passages selected."
3,Poor choice of title...,"Likewise with Carmen Miranda... She was not ""hispanic"" (of Spanish descent) but rather born in Portugal and raised in Brazil. How ironic that a collection that seeks to highlight Latin American contributions to Hollywood should so casually fumble over the most basic ethnic terminology. Oh, well."
5,Great series,"As a longtime fan of Science fiction/ fantasy when I am reading a new author I look for several things; good character development, a good overall picture of this new world I have entered, a fun plot with some twists, and originality.Chris Wooding delivers on all counts and I recommend his books to anyone. I take small issue with the price of his books but that's like complaining about the glove box in a Ferrari."
3,Could be Better,"I was born and raised in this area and thought I would get this before my trip back in 2004. It is a reasonably good book, but it misses a lot of important places."
2,"It's a start, kinda.","This book is put togather very well. Lots of pictures and good explanations, with the exception that there is no historical value at all. It has a nice New Age approach but traditional Rune casters would sneer and use this book for fire startings.I must say this book gives some good ideas on making your own runes. If it calls to you get it. If not it's best left alone."
2,Reads like Stereo Instructions,"The humor in this book fell flat on it's face. Felt like the author was trying too hard to be 'funny'.Almost felt like the author was trying the conversations with God kind of format, and it just didn't work for this apologetics book.There is nothing in this book that is really too enlightening, any Christian is taught these basic things in their church, in their Faith, and the bible.The book tends to treat one as being totally ignorant of what is in the Bible or about God, and well I don't think anyone who is not already a believer is going to pick up this 'handbook to God'.The book has an almost juvenile tone to it, as if the author is explaining things to someone very young or ignorant of anything of the bible.If you want a ""God for Dummies"" book this is the one."
5,A Direct Hit,"Logan Pearsall Smith likened God to the Duke of Cambridge -- still august but a bit behind the times. Maybe Eric Metaxas could be likened to the Duke of Wellington -- sometimes on his high horse but very effective in what he does.By ""high horse"" I really just mean that he has a knack for putting pretense and needless solemnity in its place. This book reflects Eric Metaxas the man, who is known to many New York area Christians as a person who introduces speakers only at their peril. What he has achieved here is a compendium of succinct, incisive summaries of key topics in apologetics. Send this to a friend who thinks that to become a Christian is to become a killjoy. A person who truly believes is more like Martin Luther when he said, ""If I'm not allowed to laugh in heaven, I don't want to go there."""
3,Good but not great,"Europe after the rain and Depression unrest are great songs, the rest is just average."
4,Great for an experimental album.,"Kreator is one of the greatest thrash bands out there, albums like Extreme Aggression, Terrible Certainty, and Coma of Souls are all excellent thrash metal classics.However, on this album, thrash is not what you find. It seems that nearly every thrash band changed styles in some form in the early 90's, and Kreator was no exception. The difference however, Kreator didn't follow trends and make an album that would appeal to non metalheads and get massive radio play, no, they kept their aggression, but mixed in a strange industrial sound. What you get is something that somewhat reminds me of Slayer's Divine Intervention, however this album is good, and I thought Divine Intervention sucked.Get this if you want a little something different from an excellent thrash band. Also check out Endorama if you want another cool experimental Kreator album."
5,"Different, but still the best of Kreator","What distinguish this album from the former and the latter Kreator albums are that:1. Slow(er).2. Have synth effects3. Downtuned vocals4. Downtuned guitarsSo is it a bad album? No way. This is one of the best (for me it IS) Kreator albums ever. Political lyrics, aggressive sound, riffs & riffs... Euro-thrash in its purest form..."
3,I like it,"For me Renewal is a slower Kreator album but I guess coming right after Coma of souls it was a dissapointment to most. For me its a Sign of the times album with what the Metal scene was evolving to. Incidentally 92-97 were bad years for metal with the ""alternative "" sound being popular and thrash bands losing contracts to bands like Collective soul and lame bands like that. Anyway Renewal is not like Coma or Extreme but it blows away anything bands like Anthrax, Metallica and Testament were doing at the time."
4,A touching and humerous must-see.,"This video provides a peek into the lives of brothers, authors, and story-tellers Frank, Malachy, Mike, and Alphie McCourt. They recount their childhood dreams and poverty-stricken reality in this 90 minute documentary directed and produced by Malachy's son Connor McCourt. This is an extrodinary video that leaves the viewer in tears from both the humorous and heart-breaking tale of four boys struggling in the lanes of Limerick with an dead-beat alcoholic father, a strong and noble mother, and the deaths of three siblings. This is a must-see for fans of Angela's Ashes and A Monk Swimming!"
5,Outstanding Series and Now on Netflix,A long time Transformers fan - I can say that this series is one of the best. Rich animation and a high level of technical expertise has made a product worth watching. I kept the whole series on while working and it just keeps the day interesting.
5,My son loves this show!,"My son loves this show, so glad to see it on DVD so he can watch it whenever he wants."
