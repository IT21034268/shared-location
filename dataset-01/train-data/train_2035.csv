1,A bunch of losers,"This book was about people who are losers. People who remain friend or lovers with people they went to grade school with because they don't have enough self-esteem to get a real life.The main characters in this book live in a microscopic world of limited emotions, selfish neurosis and fear of life. It was pathetic."
2,Frustratingly engaging,"I wanted to like this book. The premise was interesting. The prose was nice. The dialogue pretty real.I even bought a few of the characters. I wanted to like it a lot. But that Carrie Bell was a real piece of work. The author's insistence on perpetuating the image of the Midwest as a vapid expanse of bland nothingness and by contrast, New York City as a cultural mecca so ripe with coolness that even tortured, emotionally detached losers are deep, is an insult to residents of both areas. Don't even get me started on the inexplicable arrival of the very trendy Gay Male Best Friend character...All that said, I did finish it. I found it interesting. And, glaring cliches aside, well written.Perhaps it was simply the Wisconsinite (NOT Wisconsonian) in me who just couldn't get over the insult of having being born and bred in the same state as that whiny, shallow Carrie Bell."
2,The world through an unaware person's eyes,"I had high hopes for this book, but was dissapointed. The lead character appeared to be skimming along through life, and I found myself reading the book much the same way hoping for something to catch my attention."
2,"I'd Rate it 2.5, but don't have the option.","By half way through ""The Dive.."", I was just biding time, waiting for things to wrap up so I could move on.It seems like a kid's book, a coming of age story better recommended to younger, 20 something readers, but not containing enough depth or texture for a more mature reader with some life experience."
3,"Wish it was more bolder, less predictable","This was just ok. I had a hard time figuring out what all the hoop-la was about back when this was featured in one of the morning show book club. It has a great premise and it could go many places, but I found many of the places it went silly and predictable....and even unexplainable. Some parts of the novel were too engrossed in unnecessary detail that I skipped over sentences here and there.But overall, I enjoyed the unique plot of the novel - very different from the usual ""boy meets girl"" story. It may also be interesting to read a mini-novel about Mike's (the accident victim) point of view. I just would like it to have been more bolder in some places and less predictable in others."
2,"Sadly, very mediocre","I had high hopes for this book, after reading initial reviews from Publishers Weekly and others. When I finally sat down to read it last weekend, I was sorely disapoointed. The book jackets claims ""ferociously paced"" and I found it dragging immensely.Carrie is a truly vile character. For some odd reason, however, her friends in Madison continue to cater to her when there is truly no need. Halfway through the book , the ending is blatent. Many parts of the story that were interesting were left totally unexplored and hanging.I found this trite and Carrie's entire existence in NY seemed fruitless. Although some parts were fine and it was well-written, it was a very typical Midwestern story, with no real distinction between the thousands of other coming-of-age, change-of-heart midwestern sagas out there. Not much to fuss about."
2,"Ultimately, who cares?","Although this book was quick and somewhat engaging, when I completed it I was left wondering what I had just read. The character development is so anemic that you don't care about Carrie, Mike, Kilroy, Rooster, or any of the other main players. The best one in the whole thing was the mom, who at least spoke some sense once in awhile, but who rarely made an appearance and was never fleshed out. I was waiting for some major symbolic meaning to emerge in the use of the sewn garments (nightgown/robe and green velvet dress) but it never surfaced. We never find out what makes Kilroy tick, and the cliched description of New York was too much! Overall, not worth the time spent reading it."
3,Still scratching my head at Clausen's Pier,"This was an interesting book. It kept my attention. However, I found I did not like the main character at all. She is weak and selfish. I found parts of the book unbelievable. Like, this would not happpen in real life. I think some of the characters cut Carrie a break when they shouldn't have. In a positive note to the author, if she was trying to get my attention, she did.The book has left an impression. But I can't say it is a positive one."
2,A Danielle Steele romance novel with literary pretensions...,"...that Ms. Packer can't quite live up to. Oh, she writes well (which kept me going the first hundred pages or so), but her main character is such a passive, ambivelent person that it's very hard to care what happens to her. And Kilroy is a real pain in the butt, a completely bogus character. As a lifelong NY cynic myself, I saw nothing in the guy that was in any way authentic. He's a writer's pretentious idea of what a deep, troubled intellectual must be like. I kept waiting for Carrie to slap him and tell him to get over himself, but no such luck. Mike, for all his confinement, is the most active person in the book. Ultimately this is nothing more than a plain, old-fashioned Harlequin-type ""women's novel,"" tarted up as literature. I lost interest half-way through and skimmed the rest, and I'm glad I did."
2,There are better beach reads......,"This is one of those books that you have to convince yourself to continue reading, and in some cases, particularly in section 2, bribe yourself to finish. The only character of any interest is Mike, and at times, Carrie's mother. Why anyone in New York was begging Carrie to return is beyond me. On a good note, I thought the author did a nice job with the ending, not everything needs to be wrapped in a bow and resolved. There are better beach books this summer, I am on to ""The Lovely Bones""."
3,"I will read Packer's next book, but...","You only get really mad and upset with the people you care about, right? That's how I felt about Carrie Bell and her life in fiction. I loved the plot, but I needed so much more from Carrie. I needed her and her fellow characters to be more developed, to hate more, love more, have more believable problems, intricacies, more, more, more."
2,The first half is so boring I don't know if I can go on,"This book is so over-filled with so many details and descriptions that are actually distracting from what could be a good story. I find the main character, Carrie, unlikable as well, so I don't really care what happens to her."
2,Oh Please......!,The author had the opportunity to make a rich novel. Instead it is a book that will eventually make its way to the clearance table at the bookstore.
3,"A compelling read, yet strangely unsatisfying","I have mixed feelings about this book. In many ways, I could relate to Carrie Bell's feelings and experiences in her relationships with respect to her friends and boyfriend. (For example, my friend Jodi is a total dud, and I know what it is like to feel suddenly like you can no longer relate to a close friend). Nonetheless, I was often frustrated by the choices Carrie made, and though I definitely always wanted to read on to find out what happened, the outcome in the plot came up short for me. Still, a very fast and generally entertaining read nonetheless."
5,You wish...,"A.J. Rathbun writes the poems that you wish you would have written.He writes the poems that you wish you would have written after walking home drunk with the certainty that this time it was for real, or the poems that you wish you would have written after she left with your Wallace Stevens, your bootleg cassette of the Clash at CBGB's, and the last third of the Maker's Mark, or, quite possibly, the poems that you wish you had written on the bus to San Francisco as you watched the sunrise burn away the last three years of your life.These poems are solid. They are real. They are right."
4,Nice !,"These were a bargain on sale and absolutely gorgeous! I wanted a slide/wedge and found these on sale. Comfortable and could be worn to the office or with jeans. The heels have very small imperfections (scratches) that made me think they may have been returned, but it matters little. These shoes are quality made and will last years. I usually wear a 7 and only a 7.5 was available. I took the chance they'd fit fine as a slide and they did. Perfect fit. The leather criss cross section has a small wedge elastic which enables the top leather to 'give' with each step. Nice touch that adds to the comfort of the step."
2,I think the product is good ... but!,"After ordering the Addonics pocket CD-ROM from this electronics fender it came in reasonable time. But my laptop would not work with it. I think the problem was with my lap top and not the CD-ROM. So I never had a chance to use it. I contacted the fender and they were very helpful and told me that I could return it and provided all of the help I needed to return the device. The only problem, my account has not yet been credited three weeks after returning it."
3,NOT ENOUGH,"John Fulton is an excellent writer with all the stuff to become a great one. This novel is way too bleak, in my opinion. The bad, uncomfortable, painful scenes follow one after another, without a single ray of hope... ever. It is beautifully observed, gorgeously written, achingly painful... but it doesn't have a central idea to walk away from it with...except perhaps that life [is terrible]. Other than admiring the fine prose, the reader gets nothing except a depressing situation to ponder. I want more from this talented writer than a heaping helping of gloom; I want a larger context to view all this from and Fulton doesn't provide it. I don't want anything trite or Hallmark, mind you, just SOMETHING redemptive."
2,disapointed,"I used to read and watch all of Asterix and Obelix adventures back when I was a kid, and I thought to have those dvd as a collection would be a great thing to keep for memories. The story is fine its the graphical aspect of the movie. Most older movie that are converted from vhs to dvd are set to fit your lcd or plasma tv. However those dvd's aren't. Most of the time you would see 2 black thick lines between the images if it's an old movie, but this one, its 4 thick black lines, like the shape of your old TV which the ratio was 4:3. Makes the character smaller on screen.I am waiting for the other supposedly remastered version dvd's of Asterix and the 12 tasks and see how it will come out. Hopefully it will look better."
1,It is not a video DVD,Please be aware. This item is advertised as a video DVD but is actually an audio DVD.
4,Well-built,"This was bought originally for a 3 year old last year. Unfortunately, he is tall for his age and has out grown it. It is a sturdy bike, just right for a little boy who is rough and tough. I found it for a slightly cheaper price last year. There is another model on this site which is yellow, that is the one I have. I like the shocks and it was easy for me to put together without too much trouble. The ride is smooth and the coaster brakes work fine."
3,An Independent Woman,Another boring book. There were far too many unlikable characters in this novel. The ones that were likable had no personality at all despite the author telling us that they did. Too much of a murder mystery for me. Not enough dialogue between the two main characters to make it romantic.
3,Interesting!?!,"This book was interesting to me. It is told through a girl's diary. Her grandmother reads her diary after her sudden death that was a car accident, but turned out she was murdered. Throughout the book you want to blame everyone, but the one you least expect is what gets you. I liked it, for Kane and Able's I guess, first fiction novel, ti was coo. I wouldn't buy it though."
2,CAN I GET MY MONEY BACK???,"I read this book in a few hours. It's a cross between the life a AAliyah,Jennifer Lopez, and P-Diddy. I expected MUCH more since this is a Triple Crown book. It's about a Pop diva named Delilah who somtimes goes by the name Lilah (sounds like Aaliyah or Liyah to me) that ends up dead in a ""CAR ACCIDENT"". Turns out she has really been murderd, so the rest of the book is all about finding out Who did it, and yes it's the person that you least expect but it's CORNEY!! I'm surprised that Terri Woods let this one off the printers. As a matter of fact...Don't y'all owe Aaliyah, Jennifer, and Puffy some money?? Trust me DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY! If your curious read it in the book store. It won't take long at all!"
2,Readable,Not a Terri Woods. Diva is a suspenseful novel about who murdered Delilah through the pages of her diary read by her grandmother.Could not understand how they can up with such a strange ending.
1,One star only because I couldn't give it no stars,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. Boring, Boring, boring. I can read a good book and 4 hours, it took me three days to read this book. I was at work doing work instead of reading. I would nap on the train and bus rather then read this book. I can't even tell you how I managed to read the book other then force myself. In fact this book looks just like it was brand knew in my collection. Because I was only read one, while books like Thugs and the women who love them, Torn, and Me and my Boyfriend look like I had the a hundred years because they have been read over and over again. Don't waste your money. I seen Kane and Abel havent' put out another book. Thank God for that!!!"
5,Very Pleased Customer,Product replaced lost adapter from moving a few times too many. I am able to use it for 2 Sony products. Finding it on Amazon saved my having to use batteries. I am a very happy customer.
2,DOENST FIT,"Make sure this D-rings actually fit wherever they;re supposed to go. Also, it feels a little uncomfortable on the elbows/triceps."
2,Insane love affair leaves a lot to be desired,"This movie was okay if your cable has gone out and you're tired of watching Tracy Lords videos. LadyHendrix says her friends say she talks about this movie too much. I agree. Insanity loves company. I have seen this movie and I have seen LadyHendrix act it out and I would say in comparing the two, LadyHendrix's version was much more entertaining. Of course the movie has more then one actress and that limits LadyHendrix' scope somewhat. But the film lacked a great deal of what I like to call ""realism."" This was obviously made during the free spirited 60's and maybe those that love it remember it through a fog of LSD. It does not hold up well while sober, straight or sane. But LadyHendrix's verions can be enjoyed as a great piece of performance art and should be filmed and released as a respectful homage."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I'm in the process of reading Forever, and I find it so tedious to sit down and read. This book is soooooooooooooo boring. I'm not even sure if it would have helped to read the prequel. This book obviously has trouble standing on its own. Skip this one, but if you don't, it may or may not help to read the first one (maybe I should pick that one up b4 I continue this one).Update: I managed to read a few more pages and for me, this story makes no sense. it's very choppy and disjointed. How did we jump from opening statements to summations with the flip of a page? And the author's excessive use of ""umm"" is very annoying. I really dont know whether to continue reading this nonsense"
5,"""Forever"" in love.....","""Forever"",a sequel to ""Until"" will take you on a marital journey with Betty and Drew. After a whirlwind courtship, Betty and Drew marries and then all hell breaks loose! Drew's mother becomes sick, Betty's no-good ex-boyfriend shows up, and Betty gets the case of a lifetime that requires most of her time! However, the subplot involving Jacqui and Stefan was so real! You could feel their emotions and concerns about their relationship. THE HIGHLIGHT? The highlight of the whole book was the character Blue. Blue gave some very encouraging words about self, life, and most importantly, love. I found myself underlining what he said!! It was that motivating! Mr. McCann is an extraordinary writer whose characters are both believable and loveable.I have read ALL of his books and I'm looking forward to the next one."
5,Timmothy McCann -- Still #1,"I have read all of Timmothy McCann's books (Until, Always, Forever), and he continues to move me with his attention to detail, his charisma, and his sensitivity. ""Forever"" continues where ""Until"" left off. Since stumbling upon Timmothy McCann by accident, I have become a devoted fan, and I enthusiastically await each new publication. Now that Mr. McCann has given us another new novel, ""Emotions"", I have already purchased it and I am ready for another great adventure.Thank you Mr. McCann for sharing your special gift with us!"
2,The Book Literally Took Forever To End...,"This book has the potential to be a great read, but the character development came along so slowly, I lost interest more times than I should have while trying to get through the book. There was just too much extranneous information and unnecessary text/description in the novel that made it just drag on.The author could have shaved maybe 50-70 pages off the novel for the reader to get the messages he was trying to convey in the book. I actually didn't read the book, but listened to the audio book. Maybe it was the narrator, who was trained for stage plays, but her narration was amusing at times, as I found her to be overdramatic to the point I thought she sounded silly.Overall, the book had some very believable story lines, but to sum it up, the book was just terribly too long for what story actually was."
3,Sequel to until,"Betty and Drew are married now, after meeting online in Until. The marriage is not what the two throught it would be, Betty has just landed a big case, and also and old lover comes back in the picture, that she realize she still have feelings for. Drew has to take care of his dying mother, and he dosen't feel like Betty love him like he do her. Can the two reclaim the love they had in the beginning of their marriage. I throught the book was good but dull at times."
3,FOREVER.... 3.5 STARS,"I have mixed feelings about this book. There were points in this book where I just had to put it down because the story was becoming boring. I wanted so hard to like this book because I had no problems loving Until.The book begins at the wedding of Betty and Drew. Betty initally has mixed feelings about marrying Drew but she marrys him anyway because she feels that she truly does love him. Drew on the other hand is having problems because his mother is dying from cancer and that is what killed his ex fiance Felicia. Drew starts to have second thoughts about being married to Betty because she doesn't show her affection and never says 'I love you'. To top all of that off Betty has chosen to defend 'Bear' a popular NFL superstar who has been accused of murdering his wife and girlfriend.Like I said, there were times when I really enjoyed the book and other times when I could not focus..."
2,It almost took FOREVER to read this book!,"I kept reading this book in the hopes that it would eventually get better, but it never did. I can't understand how these characters can be so intelligent and successful but yet trifling and stupid at the same time. What woman, no matter how busy, wouldn't be there for her husband when his mother is dying? I just didn't find the characters or the plot for that matter, to be believable. If you really must read this book, save your money and go to the library."
5,Breath Taking,"Timmothy McCann has successfully captivated the attention of readers in this masterpiece. This interwoven tale of love, deceit, mystery, poetry, and commitment says very little about the book itself. Timmothy McCann while captivating us with this storyline of friendship, dedication, and loyalty allows the reader to feel the very essence of his soul. He has allowed the reader to enter into his personal space. It is as if one can feel his love floating from chapter to chapter and his spirit dancing from page to page. God has trully given him a spendid talent and a heart to share it with others. Thank you Mr. McCann for touching many lives. You have delved in the hearts of many and touched ME deeply. I have enjoyed the ride....Until.....Always......Forever......"
5,Quality and Value in Children's DVDs,"The Move with Me DVD series is, in my opinion, the best young children's yoga series available. It is creative, engaging, fun and playful - these are the best ways for young children to learn about their minds and bodies. I am recommending this series to all my trainees and teachers.I look forward to more products.Joanne Spence, Executive Director, Yoga in Schools."
4,"It's cheap, it works","As an earlier reviewer mentioned, keep your expectations realistic for this device with its low price point, and it will fill the bill. I'm using an old Canon Speedlite 188A flash unit with the adapter, and it works reliably under controlled conditions -- my main usage is for taking portraits. I have the adapter screwed onto a tripod (you'll need to find a wingnut or hex nut plus a washer to clamp it down tight) and I set this up off to the side anywhere from 2ft to 10ft away from the digital camera to get a range of lighting effects. Pointed at the ceiling, you can get a nice bounce flash for even lighting. I discovered that I can mount the flash either forwards or backwards on the hot shoe to give me greater flexibility in sensor placement. For just a few bucks, I've improved the lighting of my digital pictures immeasurably."
1,It's a joke ;(,"Never buy this product, it is made of f....king cheap plastic that you can break easily.The grid is useless if you try to attach a heavy camera to it.The slave sensor for the flash is also another joke, it had been NEVER worked at all.My suggestion, buy something else."
3,"Nice concept, dissapointing execution",When I first opened the package I was outraged at how it was made from cheap plastic and had already started to curl. I decided to make the best of it and started to use it with my Nikon 4500. It didn't stand up to regular use and started to break and fall apart. I glued it together twice and then taped it when it broke again. While it was together it worked very well. Batteries lasted forever and always flashed. I liked it so much I considered making reinforcements of aluminum but it really started to crumble so I gave it up. Thicker plastic or a better grade sure would have made this a 5 star product!
3,"Seem to work Ok, but could be better.","The Sunpak Digital Camera Flash Adapter seems to work as it should, but there are a few things I would like to see changed to make it a much better product. The flash mode select button is on the side where you thumb rest and I find that holding the hand grip my thumb presses the flash mode select button and changing the flash mode. The Flash can be detatched from the camera with a lock/unlock button that's located on the bottom of the Flash adapter and I am not sure I would trust the unlock/lock button to function as it should, because when I thought that the lock was on it was off and could cause the camera or flash to fall to the floor. I would also like to see a tripod socket on the bottom of the hand grip so you could setup the flash on a tripod. There's a tripod socket located on the knob that secures the adapter to the camers, but none on the hand grip."
4,"IT WORKS WELL IF, LIKE ME, YOU NEED IT","With my digital camera that lacks either a hot shoe or a p.c. socket but does have a fairly weak built-in flash this product works exactly as it is advertised when properly set, and setting it is easy to figure out. It also is a convenient handgrip for a small camera. If you don't understand to begin with why you might want to purchase this particular product any suitable explanation that I could offer would be far too long and tedious."
2,"It works, but could be a lot more solid","It works, but the build quality is so poor that I don't use it = waste of money. You basically have to hold both flash and camera, since the plastic will not support the weight of either."
3,Re: The Mode Issue,"I've read the reviews on this item and I too was annoyed with no directions on the mode setting. I have a Sport Digital Olympus 5500 Zoom, set on portrait from the scene mode, fired with mode set to one, poor quality pic, then set the mode to five with a great result and finished without the adapter/slave light and the pic was a little better than mode setting one. There may be some other issues here!!! This little adapter will work for me as I am back into film for fun with Nikon SLR and Bessa/Leica RF and available light... films these days are great, but I do a lot of digital with grandkid activites..so, I'm a photog have'n fun with my cameras. Hope this might be of some help. Dr. Rody"
3,Not good with other cameras going off,"It isn't a bad idea if you're the only flash camera in the room. Problem is, since it's a slave, it will go off with other cameras flashing, especially if they're close to yours. Also would only recommend with a average to small flash unit, it will wobble with a heavy one.Lets put it this way, if you have a small camera that doesn't have a hot shoe and you have an extra flash lying around (that was my situation) it does work, but I would suggest you experiment a lot to find out how it will work for you, I wouldn't go to a wedding with it fresh out of the box!"
4,works well,I bought this as a slave for my Kodak digital because the onboard flash for it did not seem to work very well with indoor shots. I wanted to get more depth and this slave flash worked fine. My Kodak doesnt have any jacks for the hotwire so the features of the flash arent really available to me. It seems to be a very nice unit for the money.
1,Did absolutely nothing on hand or foot :(,"I was very careful to follow the directions completely. This stuff did nothing at all. It's simple enough to use and only slightly painful, but such a huge waste of money. Plus, once you use it you can't treat with something else while you wait for the freeze to (not) work.We had one child with a hand wart and it did discolor it, but after several treatments we switched to a bottle treatment with applicator brush. That did the trick.My other son has come up with a wart on his foot recently and we tried freeze off on it. It didn't do a thing.A total waste of time and money."
2,Didnt work for me,"I used it once. Skin became red in the area of application, then purple. Thouht it might work but they grew up again. I had to go to the specialist. It wasn't that painful."
1,Didn't work at all for me,"I tried 3 separate applications of this product on two different warts and have gotten no results at all. They are both still there and look just as bad as when I started my first treatment. One wart is all calloused up and the other is soft and both still look that way after 3 treatments.Someone told me that this doesn't work well on the warts that are calloused, but then why didn't it work on my other wart? At this point, I give up on the product. I'm going to the dermatologist today to get the warts looked at.Amazon has a great price on this if you purchase it along with something else to qualify for the free shipping."
1,NO,"Hopefully you were smarter than me and read reviews before you bought this overpriced product. Put it this way. The instructions say ""if you use a treatment wait 2 weeks before attempting another treatment"" Well, after 2 treatments over 1 month didn't work for me I tried 3 treatment in 10 minutes, and each treatment was 10-20seconds over the recommended application time. Guess what happened? well, it is 2 weeks later, and the wart on my finger has doubled in size.i have seen positive feedback on this product and i'm curious if they bought it when it was a very very small wart or a d-bag share holder/company man."
3,Disappointed,"I love Kenny Rogers, but I was disappointed in the sound quality of this CD. Perhaps they were unable to improve upon the quality of his earlier recordings. Had I known, I would have made another choice from among his many CDs."
5,"Won't Get You Laid, But Will Get You Fed","If you want to eat free for the next few months then read this book and steal Simpson's witty, wicked lines. You'll be invited to every dinner party in town and be the centre of attention. Why Simpson isn't more famous in the US I don't know - but it suits me just fine. All my friends think I'm the new Oscar Wilde."
1,"Don't waste your time waiting for tonight, because....","...it'll already be too late to win any special awards for your oversexed styles, which I hope you didn't."
5,Waiting For Tonight rocks,Waiting For Tonight is an awesome song and the remixes are very well done. Jennifer is da bomb.
5,Question? Can someone help,"I am trying to find the remix of ""Waiting for tonight"" that is playing on Mtv. Is this the one? Thanks for any help."
1,"I did not like, because I thought it would work on the vehicles you say and not true.","Buy this piece thinking that operates at a VW, but did not work, the opening of the piece is larger than the vehicle."
2,Not a great buy but a good buy,"I was a little dissapointed with this product.First of all it has some brown spots on it I had expected it to be shiny and glossy looking, but it was dull and kind of old looking.But once you can clean it up it can be used for various occassions.It was a good buy overall but not an excellent purchase."
3,Okay,There was some rusting on this item. My mom ordered it for her baking business. She is still happy with it.
1,Tepid read,"The highlight of this book was Lady Scruples, and if the book's main plot had been about this aristocratic tabloid writer, The Art of Seduction would have been a hilarious and sexy read. Instead, it is filled with over the top characters and antics, gaping plot holes and cliched plot devices. The heroine's pain over her unrequited love for the hero would have rang true had we been shown why she felt the way she did about herself instead of being told. The hero was quite dim at times, but his redeeming quality was that he was immune to the villaness' evil doings towards the heroine. If the heroine hadn't spent so much time pouting over how unworthy and unlovely she was for the hero, TAoS would have been an entertaining read. Instead, TAoS forced you to suspend your belief, stretch your patience and have you gnashing your teeth in frustration by the last page."
3,Not One of My Favorite Books,"It is not often that I give a book less than four stars, in fact I think this is only the fourth. But this story line is one that sets my teeth on edge. The heroine Parris professes to have loved the hero Dominick for as long as she can remember, however she never fails to believe the worst of him. She believes everyone including her B**** of a sister who wouldn't know the truth if it bit her on the a**. So how great can this love be.Dominick continuely tries to seduce Parris instead of talking to her. He wants to bed her but can't seem to communicate how he feels and why. In fact they both bumble along through the entire book making one mistake after the other. It isn't until the last few chapters that they finally work things out.I have loved the rest of Ms George's books, but this one forced to read the last two chapters and put it away."
5,The Art of Seduction,"This book was simple wonderful. I have read many, many books and I must say I was getting a little bored with reading. Then I found this book. This is my first Melanie George novel and it will not be my last. This book was so great that I had it read in about 10 hours. I was teary eyed when I finished it simply because it didn't want it to end.Like the other reviewer, I agree about the back of the book. ""Lady Scruples"" is not really what the book is about. It's about two people that have loved each other since childhood. They are split apart because of a mistake, but they find each other again after eight years of separation. I don't want to spoil anything for the reader, so I won't say anymore, except, this book was truely wonderful."
1,Misleading title,"The title is totally misleading. The author has probably given the story this title hoping that people will buy the book in order to learn about the tricks of seduction. However it is barely possible to read even the first five pages. The book itself is neither hard porn nor soft porn,nor a top class story. I would recommend a hard porn ""Oh Wicked Country""---BY Anonymous but written by Jean Paul Satre' according to common knowledge,probably leaked out by some insider. This book simply doesn't fit the bill."
3,A mix of language and culture,"Let me begin by stating that this is a serious piece of language learning material. It's not a ""Learn 1,000 Japanese Words And Phrases While Watching Friends"" book. (That's a plus.) In this book they cover all the ""usual"" beginner material but they also tell you how to behave properly. (That's also a plus.) However... it wasn't very fun. Serious and detailed but it missed that little extra that made you want to keep going. Also, the audio material was a bit limited."
5,Magnifical pictures and plates.,"A beautful book, maybe the most wonderful Godwin's work. The plates and pictures just are comparable with a Manly Hall's ""magnus opus"", ""The Secret Things of All Ages"". Good spend of money."
3,Ok for reference,"When I first started looking at the explanation for perspective I thought it was pretty good. But as it went on, I thought no one is going to pay me to take this much time to do a rendered drawing! This book could be good for developing your eye and understanding of perspective but there are short cuts that will give you better than acceptable results. There are also books that have more to offer in terms of rendering the presentation. I have found that no one singular book completely communicates everything you need. This one, I could have done without."
2,Not For Artists,"It is a really nice book; however it does not teach you the basics of how to draw perspective. It does not work for artists, it is for interior designer who know quite a lot about perspective."
3,Perspective for Interior Designers,I rate this book with 3 stars because is the first time that I read this book
2,How About Some Brakes?!,"I bought this bike at Toys R Us for $69 with a $10 assembly fee.For $79 this is a cheap bike, with cheap components...including very very very cheap brakes. I spent over an hour adjusting the brakes (which may have been designed by Martians since they are extremely flawed in design and convenience here on earth) on this bike and even with them seemingly working perfectly, you cannot lock either the front or rear brakes. My son can't even skid the back tire on dirt!Perhaps the rubber material is too hard to bite the rim surface? They seem to slide along too easily.The shocks are also very suspect, but a bit of silicone spray seemed to smooth the motion for now.If you need a bike for a kid to thrash on for a year or so, you can't really go wrong for $79 but you may need to upgrade the brakes for safety reasons, which will add a few bucks to your investment."
1,sucks,when i first bought this bike the bike was on sale for 60 dollars and it looked cool but it sucks it does not shift right and i kept having problems with the shocks.
3,"24"" Boys 21speed Outreach Bike","This bike was awful to put together. The front brakes and wheel will not align. Once we took it to a ""professional"" to align everything, the bike was great. Unfortunatly we had to pay more then just the price and shipping for the bike."
2,Too much ... and not enough!,This book reads like a typical textbook - you have to really search the book to find the good stuff. The book is not appropriate for parents who are trying to get a game plan nor for general education teachers who are looking for a book to better understand their students who display ADHD-like behaviors; it's just too much and will probably be put down and not finished by the majority of people who purchase the book. The author spends too much time covering every possible ADHD topic and in the process fails to drive in the most critical points.
1,Paid for New/Received Used,I oredered a new copy this book as I like to keep them. I received a used copy with last owners name inside!
5,"A Must Have Reference for Parents, Educators & Professionals","I have used this book extensively in my roles as a parent of an ADHD child, educator and now as a clinical psychology doctoral student. It is an absolutely phenomenal resource! It offers not only diagnostic assistance and strategies but much needed hope for parents in distress. I give this book to families with children who have been newly diagnosed with ADHD, teachers I consult with and my professional peers."
2,Not quite as advertised,"I ordered and received this product, and found it to be sligtly different than advertised. The card I got was an Addonics Model ADUSB2PCI, but it had 3 external and 2 internal USB ports, instead of the 4/1 on the product page.I'm somewhat annoyed, since the internal ports are much less useful to me, so I'm loosing a whole port."
3,bellybomb,have long since removed product. product was good for what I bought it for.I no longer own the computer I purchased it for.
2,Grammar book,"Although the book was in good condition as indicated in its description, the smell of mildew was so strong that I couldn't use it or even keep it in the house."
4,Great mix of sounds,"Great suite of CDs. Nice mix of house, dance and some""harder"" stuff. I picked it up at a discount but even at the regular price, it's a greatcollection of sounds and might introduce you to some new bands."
5,Great reference for the Midwest,This is a detailed reference for us midwest gardeners. Chuck is the director of crop science at the University of Illinois and a accomplished educator.
5,"Very Good, especially for the price","I've owned this scale for about 12 years. I did not buy it through Amazon, but I am impressed to see that this scale is still available. The first 5 years it served me very well in our catering business, as my scale of choice for measuring everything. Small, compact and yet still would scale to 22 lbs. Mine is an older model so perhaps the comments about plastic parts are correct for the newer ones, but the only plastic on the one I own has worn well, and not been a problem. I'm currently researching for a digital scale. After years of service, I find that this one needs help in reading amounts below 12 ounces. I always measure at least twice, if accuracy is required. I think this is because the measuring springs inside have aged, and no longer are as strong as they should be. Which is expected with mechanical spring operated scales, so I won't count this against it."
2,accurate but flimsy,The stainless steel tray is practical and easy to clean. The unit is accurate but the plastic is flimsy. A practical kitchen product should be sturdier.
3,Average service,"I have recd. The item in time, my impression was it's USA made, but it’s made in China, you could have mentioned that in the website, I hope you never do like this in the future.Regards,PKM hassan"
2,Made in China - What a shock!,"Salter. Old English company. Maybe, but this scale is chrome plated plastic (the tray is metal) and it comes from China. Since it's traveled some 6 thousand miles it's no surprise the zero adjustment knob fell off (it won't zero with the know rattling around in the box!). I was able to re-assemble and eventually to make it operational. If you read the writeup on this scale you get the idea that it is solid, metal, quality. Not so. In fairness, I must say that once assembled it did weigh accurately. I tried 1 lb, 2.5 lb. and 8.5 lb weights and all were spot on. I'll keep it but I'm not real happy with it."
1,kitchen scale,The Salter High Capacity Mechanical Kitchen Scale arrived broken was very cheap and made of plastic.
4,Scale,"I needed a little bigger than usual kitchen scale. This one was inexpensive and works well for my canning needs. It's not terribly sturdy looking, but it is accurate (I compared weight with another, better scale) and it does the job. It is sturdier than it looks. I'd recommend it for anyone who needs a biggish but not huge scale in the kitchen."
4,Good Overall Coverage of a Tough Topic,I like the layout and content of this. I went to the latest Wrox Conference and unfortunately never met Rofail. In reviewing this book after having it a couple of months I would still buy it again
4,Great information source for VB distributed apps developers,"The book covers all significant aspects of Windows DNA application development including COM, MTS, MSMQ, IIS and SQL Server. I especially liked the sections on Stored Procedures and Web Clients. The book has nothing on COM+ though, its not even in the title! I would recommend this book if you are serious about developing distributed applications in VB."
3,Not for the armchair economist,"Kindleberger dissects manias and panics to arrive at his conclusions. In the process, though, he bombards the reader with an abundance of detail and assumes a good understanding of university economics.A non-economist will have difficulty to follow his line of reasoning. For example: ""A synthesis of Keynesianism and monetarism, such as the Hansen-Hicks IS-LM curves that bring together the investment-saving (IS) and liquidity-money (LM) relationships, remains incomplete, even when it brings in production and prices (as does the most up-to-date economic analysis) if it leaves out the instability of expectations, and credit and the role of the leveraged speculation in various assets"".For those who enjoy thoughtful, dense reading, this book will make you a smarter investor. Unfortunately, for the large investing masses, those that have lost large sums in their 401k plans lately, the academic nature of this book puts this knowledge out of their reach."
4,"extremely valuable and informative, though incomplete","for the economist in me, i resent the fact that the author didn't include the relevant quant / charts of the macroecon factors that precipitated the various extreme situations he describes. having said that, this book does describe the aforementioned factors, as well as detailed accounts of precipitiating factors, outcomes and, sadly, reoccurrences.if one had read this book prior to 99, one would have profited from the nasdaq meltdown. ---if that's not an endorsement, i don't know what is."
1,Little value added,"The book is a mess where the author seems to try to show off all the names he learned reading history books. I would expect to find some descriptional or analytical value of financial crisis, but by page 60 I still haven't found any, and thought I should report this to you.So if you want 232 pages of.. ""Bouvier's interest lies in whether Bontoux, a Catholic, failed of his own mistakes or was done in by a conspiracy of establishment Jewish and Protestant bankers resisiting an intruder. The subject lies outside our purview, but for the record, Bouvier issues a Scottish verdict of ""not proven""."", then this book is for you. There is another 44 pages of references to other books, newspapers etc for you to.. ehm, do nothing with.If you want to learn about financial crisis or recognize the next opportunities or pitfalls for your wallet this is not the book for you."
2,Great Scholarly work but how does an investor make a buck?,I don't recommend this book for a general business audience. It does a fine job of chronicling various panics. I was hoping for a book that focused on causes of panics and manias and how to identify one when you are in it.
2,Way too strong for me,"These vitamins are way too strong for me. I took them twice and probably never will again. The first time I felt no effects, but the second time my head was spinning for a good hour and I had minor palpitations. I'm in average shape and regularly take vitamins of varying kinds, depending on goals. But these just have too much B12 for comfort. Be sure to read up on B12 overdose before you regualrly take these."
3,It was good to be able to read this finally...,"however, with flames coming out of the Enteprise's nacelles, McCoy and Scotty in a gold shirts, and the characters not quite right, it was quite odd. But, some of the stories are very good."
5,A MUST FOR ALL COLLEGE STUDENTS,"Making the Grade in College by Kenneth A. GreenI was a buddy of Ken Green when he wrote the book at the University of Colorado. I gained incredibly insights into the grading processes at colleges, and with Green's suggestions, I graduated in the top 1/10 of my class at V.M.I., and later went on to graduate 3 out of 680 graduates at New York University's Graduate School of Business. This book is a must for all serious minded college students who are concerned about succeeding."
3,Cool for a year or two,This tree was awesome for the first few years but the plug gets super hot and ended up melting. So now we just have a tree that doesn't light up.
2,More of a thriller than a mystery,"This book is more of a thriller than a mystery. I'm not a big fan ofthrillers, which is why I gave it a ""2"". There is verylittle mystery. There is a lot of action, and this book might appealto fans of action-thrillers.Characters in the book seemed a bitshallow, but perhaps as you read other books in this series, you canget to know the main characters better. Where this book lacks incharacter development, it makes up in descriptions of Torontolocations. With the detailed descriptions, you'll feel like you'vevisited the same locations as the characters."
5,Ya this is the best Simpsons game ver see!,"This Game brings the knowledge of Simpsons, a useful thing, like how many spikes are on barts head and whats Lisa's Middle Name? If your a Simpsons fan and you don't know this , get ahead of the game and purchase this great item! Im a big fan and i'll say that I love it! and will buy second for my siblings!!"
3,Simpsons' Trivia Game Review,"The Trivia Game has over 2000 trivia questions, however, it doesn't make a really fun game to play as stated in the instruction guide. The rules are kind of complicated. I use it purely for the trivia questions and forget about the game part of it."
5,So glad I made this purchase,My 2 year old daughter LOVES this potty seat. Being able to sit on the big potty makes her feel like a big girl as opposed to the little potty chair she has used since she was 1. The Disney Princess theme makes it all the better.
2,The hole is too small,We got this potty seat for our 20 months old son but the hole is just nice for his size and he is just a medium size baby. It is not easy to put him on this potty seat especially with the splash guard installed. He didn't like to go on this potty seat with the splash guard on as he feels uncomfortable on this thigh.
2,Straight to the junk pile,"We got this as a second potty seat so my son would have child sized potties on both floors. Assembly is easy and the seat is very soft but the hole is significantly smaller than the other seats we have, forcing us to use the splash guard which my son doesn't like. As other reviewers have mentioned, clean up is messy, and the seat can be wiggly."
3,"works ok, but there are better out there","I bought this 100% based on the cars theme. My son is 4, and LOVES cars! We are trying everything and anything under the sun to help get him to go poo on the toilet, needless to say we have a lot of potty's and seats:) While he loves the theme, it is VERY SMALL. When my 2 year old daughter sits on it, I am always checking to be sure she is in the right spot to be sure everything makes its way into the toilet and not all over the place. I can see how this may not hold up over time, you just don't get the feel that its very well made. But, you get what you pay for. The handles on it is a plus, I do like that feature. Overall its a good buy just for the fact that it has Lightening McQueen on it!"
2,Potty Seat,Not a very good potty seat. Doesn't sit right on the toilet. Grandson slides all over and then is afraid to go to the bathroom. Would not recommend.
3,Good seat.,"The only complaint I have with this product is the whole where my son's bottom sits seems to be a little small. He red piece in the front is very high and protects from getting pee everywhere. It has slid a couple of times, but that's because I haven't used the little pads to stick it to our toilet seat because we move this seat to different bathrooms and other people use the toilet too, not just my 2 1/2 year old."
4,Great potty seat,"Generally, its a great potty seat. We've had it about a month now, and my 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves it. I was happily suprised to find that the pink plastic frame has sparkles in it, which I couldn't see from the pic provided.The soft cushion is fully removable(fully cleanable), the only slight drawback is that the cushion can become displaced when my daughter lifts the seat by the cushion rather than the handles. It fits pretty well on the toilet seat.Over all, I reccomend this product."
4,Best splash guard.,"Ordered this one online after looking over potty seats in stores (the splash guards were all so small - why bother?) - my kid loves it, it's easy to clean, and the splash guard is comfortable.I took off one star because yes, you do need to take it completely apart and clean it (often!) as urine gets trapped between the parts. Still happy with the seat, though."
5,Best potty seat for boys!,This was the only potty I could find that had a high enough shield in the front for boys. It's comfortable and prevents mess. Highly recommend!
2,"cheap, flimsy, ill-fitting","My 2 1/2 yo daughter picked this out fromthe website as her second potty seat for her Grampa's house, and she picked it for the color and the Princesses. In that respect, it was fine - it's pink and looks just like the picture. Unfortunately, it didn't fit at all well on the toilet seat, which was - in the potty's defense - one of the newer types of contoured seats.Basically, the thing slid all over the toilet while my daughter tried to use it, and I'd have to hold the whole set-up in place. Good thing it has handles (which she really liked)Also, it's really light and flimsy, and the vinyl cushion feels like it would work it's way off in short order. So, I wouldn't even think it's going to be easy to keep clean.So - if you just like it for the price and the color, and have an old-style toilet seat, it's probably ok. If you want something durable and secure, get something like the Bjorn."
4,"Great seat, works fine, but pad and base should lock together","This seat works fine, and the colors/pictures are great. The handles on the side help prevent kids from grabbing toilet seat. It was a good idea to allow the cusion part to be removable for cleaning. HOWEVER, there should be a locking mechanism (flip tab, thumb screw, or other) to keep the pad on the plastic part of the seat. It stays on fine when in use, but when we travel & I put put the seat in a grocery bag or backpack, the padded part sometimes detaches from base and requires you to put it back together before putting on toilet. Not great if you've been using it that day. The padded part could also come loose and fall into toilet water as it's being place on seat, depending on how clumsy you might be.Overall, happy with product and design. Have had no problem with detaching seat pad, just wish it had option to secure it to plastic base."
5,Good seat!,"This seat is OK. IT has the high pee deflector that IS removeable. The opening is the average 5x6.5in. Do not get the brand that looks very similar but is NOT made by First Year. That product does not have the same deflector. The seat sits in place pretty well with just the ring that extends 'into' the toilet but shifts a little less with the 4 foam tabs to place on the underside of the plastic ring (between the ring and your attached toilet seat).It's more cumbersome to carry around (eg diaper bag) because the back design protrudes up and out, adding more length it. Overall, it's a great ring, especially if you need deflection."
5,I am buying 2 more!,"This potty seat is wonderful for boys. I have three other potty seats in my house and this is the one preferred by my son and my husband and me. In fact, I am buying 2 more. Our favorite feature is the HIGH protective cup. All of the other potty seats have a much smaller cup and we have had to do some clean up. It is also comfortable, fits the toilet well (no sliding around), and my son like to hold onto the handles which are (thankfully) well elevated from the toilet seat."
1,Not adjustable so it shifts around on the toilet,"It's a cute seat, but it shifts around on the toilet so when my son sat down on it it nearly dumped him in the toilet! Scared him to death. Needless to say, I think it's useless."
5,Was a potty-training 'treat',"My daughter LOVES pooh bear so was much more motivated to use this potty than I would have thought. The pee guard does come off for girls and the seat comes apart for easier cleaning. As many others have commented; the handles are helpful for gripping when she needs to push out a poop. She loves it, so I love it."
2,assembly required.,"First thing.....they mailed me a blue one with black on the seat but it was still Disney red car. Second ...you have to assemble the seat: the plastic seat, the cushion, the pee guard, then the sticky tab. I particularly don't mind assembly...but this was annoying....because all I could think was how in the hell I was going to rinse this clean every time. Too many disconnecting parts!!!!!!!"
1,Junk - Don't buy,"First, I didn't like that I had to put it together. The soft ring itself is crappy. My daughter weights 25 lbs and it 'flattened' after 2 days of use (exposing the plastic underneath and making it uncomfortable for her to sit on). It is VERY poorly made and to be honest, I am surprised it's even on the market. Went to Target and bought a REAL one (which cost me $2 less than this POS) and is made a million times better (and comes complete with a potty hook for the toilet). I didn't feel like dealing with the return so I just threw it out. What a WASTE of money..."
3,Son Loved Using it But Difficult to Clean,"Our son is a Cars fan, so he liked using this little soft seat, but the cushion doesn't come off and I could not get the front splash guard to come off for cleaning either. I tried to disinfect it in the bath tub, but after a year of use, I wound up throwing it away. I just could not get it clean enough."
4,Early Trainer,"I'll start with my one complaint... When my son sits on the seat too long, and he's a light 27lbs, he'll have marks on his hiney from where the seat cushion doesn't adequately protect the frame of the seat. He doesn't complain about it being uncomfortable but it doesn't look good. I wondered if it was a defect but a friend has the same problem. Now as for my absolute like of this seat... The Cup guard for urine is tall and wide, but the tall part is key. Most seats in the store have shallow and wide cups and my son pees right over them and makes a mess when he sits and pees. But with this seat he never makes a mess! I love this! I also like that at 18 months this seat fit him perfect and now a year later its still fits him, he doesn't fall in and isn't too heavy for it. All and all this is a great seat, just the seat marks is my main complaint!!"
2,Not a stable potty seat,"I was so excited to buy my son a potty seat. He is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months. He picked out the pooh and loved it and I love the splash guard. Unfortunately, the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor. He is not leaning over to the floor, the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor. This seat is quite tipsy!"
1,Slips too easily,This seat is cute but it slips too easily. The opening is too small for a 3 year old and the anti-skid pads did not touch the toilet seat even after trying to adjust the locations. Pick another one.
5,Great!,This has been a blessing. My son now actually wants to use the potty. He does however call the cup that keeps him from peeing all over a reindeers nose. haha but he is using the potty now!
4,my daughter loves it,my daughter loves this seat. she gained confidence in using the toilet. She is on her way to be totaly clean.
2,One weird thing,"So, the princess seat part isn't attached to the pink part with the handles. It's weird. It falls off when you move it at all. I ended up duct taping them together. FYI. It's still a good product, I was just really surprised that they're not attached to each other. So weird."
2,Wont fit on toilet,"It's cute but when my baby sits on it it slides. There is extra room in the back and it doesn,t fit securly on the toilet so she has to literally follow the seat because it moves back when she sits on it. Not a good trainer seat."
4,"Different color, but same old seat!","We purchased this because we had purchased one exactly like the image at the store.The color did, in fact, vary. The one that arrived from amazon had blue plastic. But it works just as well.So, unless you're looking for the specific color in the image, this worked well."
3,It's a potty seat,"When we needed to purchase a second potty seat I toyed with the idea of going for one of the fancy, pricier ones. But really, my 24mo son loves Cars.Our most frequently used potty seat is a 4yo Spongebob Squarepants model with no handles or a buttrest. It works just fine.With both seats, regular cleaning of the pee-stop cup is necessary because it's a game for our little guy to trying to arc over the pee-stopper.I have to say that I prefer the handle-free seat as my little guy is starting to get off the toilet on his own and the handles obstruct that.Overall, it's a decent seat for the price and that's all you really need it to be."
2,its ok...,i bought this potty seat for my son and the lip part to keep the pee from shooting me keeps falling off. the sticky grips dont stick to well. i would ask for my money back but it was cheap.
5,PERFECT POTTY SEAT,"This potty seat was absolutely perfect for my son. First of all it doesn't slide around on the seat and we have a odd shaped seat so that was good. Second, it has the gaurd that you can use or remove plus it fit his little bottom. Great product and I will use it when I begin to potty train my other son. I would recommend this product to parents looking for their sons first potty seat. He loves CARS so this incouraged him more to want to go potty."
2,Can split at seams,"This is a nice seat -- so comfy my 18-mo-old can use and stable enough that the 3yo also loves it. The handles offer added security for early potty use. We bought two of these to have on eat each toilet. However, the less-used one recently split at the seams! Sadly it's past the return date.The two-piece design is terrific for trapping urine in the little grooves and also the cushy ring often slips off when this is hung up in the bathroom since you have to hang it by one of the little handles.My parents bought theMommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seatand I think it's much comfier, much easier to clean AND it's only $10. Oh, and it also has a hook that makes it super easy for the child to hang it up after use. I'd recommend that one instead."
2,"Wobbly, child falls off seat, broke into 2 pieces","This seat wobbles alot, but we have an enlongated, curvy toilet. Holding onto the handles does not help the child because the whole seat is wobbling. Also, it came unglued into 2 pieces. Poorly constructed. But at least it has a cushioned seat. I am throwing it out."
2,not worth the money,"It looks nice and fits on the toilet well, but that's about it :( I bought this trainer seat because it's one of the few with handles, but apparently I should have spent the extra $$ and looked for something else. My daughter is 2 1/2 , and she is not a big child, however, the hole is just to small.. I have to readjust her seating position if she goes for no1 or no2 so that the seat doesn't get al dirtied up :(. The other problem is the 2 part design, which lets the fluids get between the two parts. ANd no matter how well I rinsed and washed the seat every time, after only a month it was all stinky - the foam in the upper part had absobed the stuff that got on it, so.... I'm looking for a better alternative"
3,If it has to be Disney Princesses...,"If the toilet seat you are looking for has to be Disney Princesses, then this is your seat. Over all, it functions just fine and my daughter loves the princesses. However, I much prefer the ""Munchkin"" brand seat to this one since the Munchkin brand is much sturdier and the all one piece design makes it easier to clean. The negatives for the princess seat are:The cushion separates from the hard plastic frame, I assume, for cleaning, but it often falls out when my toddler puts the seat on the potty. For a girl who wants to do it all herself, that is frustrating.The cushion isn't very cushy. After a few minutes of sitting, it ends up smashed flat. It does eventually regain its former fluffier appearance between uses.The hard plastic frame is flimsier than the Munchkin brand seat that looks similar (and is priced less) which means this seat isn't as stable."
4,Cute Potty Seat,"My 24 month old daughter loves this potty seat. I bought it for her last month, and as soon as she saw it, she wanted to start using it right away! She now goes pee-pee on it everyday (we're still working on poo-poo). The only negative to this potty seat is that it's not made for elongated seats, which we have in both of our bathrooms, so it tends to slide alittle (it doesn't seem to bother my daughter, though). I wish that would have been stated in the product description because I probably wouldn't have purchased it had I known it wasn't going to be a perfect fit. I would have returned it and exchanged it for a different one that's made for elongated seats if my daughter didn't love it so much."
3,not big enough for taller toddlers,"its ok if my son is ready to potty, but if stays there longer than 15 minutes he gets rings on his legs. its way too small for him. but he is big for his size. he is as tall as 4 year olds. so if your son is proportionate for his age its probably nice. but if hes in the 98th percentile it probably wont be good if you plan on potty training him by keeping on the toilet for a while."
1,"cute, but not very functional","I bought this yesterday (after the Diego seat we originally picked out was recalled and Target wouldn't let us have it).It will be going back to the store today. My son is 2.5 and not a big kid. With the pittle pee cup thing on the front (a must for boys) the opening is not big enough to keep the peeper in there and have his but be totally over the hole. It made a HUGE mess.Not to mention that he was so crammed up against the cup, he screamed that it hurt."
1,Too small to be useful for 3.5 years old boy,"I was too disappointed by this small potty seat. It may be good for those smaller toddler. Definitely not suitable for a 3.5 years old boy, or any boy if you know what I mean. Your boy would make a mess with using it. I am giving it away to goodwill."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered two of these training rings - one for when my daughter is at home and one for when she is at her grandparents during the week. One arrived in perfect condition, the other was disappointingly split at the seams. So I returned it and had another one shipped back to replace it. I received it yesterday and was upset to find that it too was also split at the seams. So I am returning it once again and asking for a refund, since I feel I will be better just going to the store to buy one that I can inspect before hand. To be honest, the one that arrived in tact works just fine. I guess it is just the luck of the draw depending on if you receive one that is in good condition or defective. Good luck if you decide to order this."
3,Cute potty seat,"I got this potty seat for my son and he didn't use it often, he didn't like the cover in the front at all. He wanted to be a big boy and didn't use a potty seat at all. This is really nice if your child uses it, I handed this off to my sons cousin and he loves it."
1,Only lasted a few weeks,"This fit well on the toilet, and I lived the splash guard, but after only two weeks the top padding kept coming off. I kept putting it back together because I didn't want to give up and pay fir a new one but then in started to smell like Urine badly and the connecting parts made it really difficult to clean. I opted for the Arm and Hammer seat, and we love it. In fact, it's lasted a year!"
1,not good,"This item i not sturdy and is universal, which means it might fit some seats and not others. It comes off easily from our seat."
4,success,"our boy is 28 months and we where able to successfully potty train him with this seat, he was sooooo excited it had cars on it, and loves the handles, our only ""complaint"" is that our toilets have the comfort size seats, and since this seat doesnt have latches or anything to hook to the seat we found it doesnt fit just right. would i buy it again knowing this? for the price yes."
1,Disappointed too...,This seat is adorable and comfortable - if it only fit our toilets. It does not fit the toilet and my daughter cannot use it.
2,Flimsy,"This potty seat is not very sturdy. It just lays on top of the regular toilet seat. It does have rubber cushions on the bottom of the potty seat, but it doesn't do much to keep it from sliding around."
1,too small for my 3 yr old to use--huge mess. do not buy,"My daughter is all about princesses, so this seemed like a cute idea. It fit well on the toilet, but the opening is very small--a good two inches smaller in diameter than our boring old Graco version. The result? When she pees, it splashes out all over the bathroom floor, and gets between the seat and the plastic. She is not particularly big (75th percentile in height and weight), so I must conclude that it's just a bad design since other similar products work well for her without creating a huge mess.Get a different product unless you like cleaning the bathroom every time your child has to pee."
2,Not as convenient as I thought,"My son insisted on having a ""Cars"" potty before he would potty train. So, seeing how this seems to be the 1 and only Cars themed potty, I bought it. I thought it would have a snapping mechanism of some kind to make it secure on the toilet, but all it has is weak foam non slip pads that go underneath. It slides around easily on the seat and is too dangerous to allow my son to climb up himself so it's useless for us. It was a waste of money. Maybe it sits snug on some other toilet seats; I thought our seat was standard but I guess I was wrong. I would advise against this seat unless your child is almost as big as an adult because it doesn't stay in place and could cause them to fall. In our case, a fall in the small bathroom could easily result in injury; not worth the risk."
2,Not for big kids,"My son is on the large size. He is 37"" tall & 39 pounds. These seat is too small for him. The hole is too small which requires him to push forward right up against the splash guard. The guard is hard plastic & cuts into his legs leaving deep red marks. He hates it. He tried it a couple times & now refuses to use it.I switched to a combo potty seat that has a removable soft seat & a much bigger hole. This one will be placed on Freecycle. I only recommend this for those training very small children."
2,Trainer ring doesn't fit every seat,"Even though I think this is a very good idea (no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand-alone potty), the ring doesn't fit our toilet seats well. We have the oblong seats, not the round ones, and the ring slides back and forth, especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it. It doesn't make her feel very stable so, so far at least, she has refused to use it."
2,"Cute and comfy, but doesn't fit our enlongated seat well","I had high hopes for this training ring. It is the perfect size for my children, but it slides back and forth on our toilet seat and, especially at the beginning of potty training, its movement is causing some unsureness on the ""big potty.""The handles are great.Unfortunately, I think my search for the ""perfect"" aid in potty training continues."
1,Not so comfortable,"This toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy. The splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin, it can be quite painful. I plan on trying the baby bjorn seat, it looks like it would be more comfortable"
5,Great Product,My son went right to it and had no problems peeing. The cup on the front works great and after month of use I am going to remove it so he can get used to using the seat without it. Hate to admit the caracters do help them do things they may not otherwise do.....
1,Interconnecting Parts & Urine... don't mix,"This is a very cute seat... it was easily assembled and worked as we had hoped, potty training progressed. The guard made it a little difficult for my son to get onto the seat himself, but the handles are genius! My biggest problem w/this seat, is that because the cushion fits into the seat base and the guard fits into the base & it all clicks together... unfortunately this leads to urine getting where you don't expect it to and before you know it... you're sniffing around your bathroom like a bloodhound. And we wiped this down pretty much every time it was used... but to have to unassemble it and wash each component after each use... is a bit much to have to do. It's really disgusting actually."
2,Uncomfortable for my son,"It's really cute and my son was very excited to use it. However, the splash guard in front is made of very hard plastic. It's very wide and it dug into his inner thighs every time he sat on the seat. After a day of using it he refused to go on the potty because he said ""it hurt"". He's just learning to go on the potty so taking the cup off didn't work well because he splashed all over. He really needs that guard. We had to put his old seat back on the toilet for him to start going again. We'll keep this seat for when he's older and doesn't need the splash guard anymore but I'm disappointed that the guard was so made of such hard plastic and is so wide."
3,sox,Keep me warm. Came quickly. Lost shape after first wash. Maybe I wasn't suppose to put them in the washing machine. I didn't take time to read the washing instructions.
2,"Mislabeled, wrong size","The socks are good, but this pair was mislabeled and wrong size sent to me. Disappointing..."
4,Icelandic socks,"These socks are wonderfully warm and cozy. I have them in navy and in black and wear them all winter long! They run a little large so it's better to order them a bit smaller than your true size.As with all wool products, it's best to wash in cold water, and skip the dryer."
4,"Great socks, if you have the time to wait!","I ordered these socks a little over a month before leaving for the Winter Olympics, in Vancouver, BC. They were to be delivered in 7 business days, through UPS. Truthfully, I lost track of time, and didn't notice they didn't arrive until the week before I was to leave. I contacted the company (no way to call- had to use Amazon compaint system) and they said UPS hadn't picked them up yet. I didn't really buy that, but what could I do. I got the socks the day before I was on the plane, just in the nick of time.The socks themselves are great. Very warm, but not wet- they wick great. I like that they are colored, so I can wear them to semi-formal events."
1,Terrible,"I am very disappointed in these socks. I bought them to wear indoors, because I don't like to wear shoes, but my feet seem to get cold easily, especially my toes. To be honest, I cannot actually tell any difference between these socks and any other socks I have. They may be slightly thicker, but they do not keep my feet warm at all. I am wearing them right now, indoors, and my feet are cold.They are very comfortable, they just don't do the job.WIth shipping, I paid $30 for two pair, and I feel it was a total waste of money. I really cannot understand how they would work outside in a cold climate, when I didn't even have luck with them indoors.FYI, I am NOT someone with health problems or chronic illness."
4,Hot cocoa for your feet,"Might as well be. These socks feel great to wear. Aside from the plush comfort on the interior, they do a good job of keeping your feet warm and dry. You will find yourself rubbing your feet together in the socks, just because it feels that good. Seriously, try it.They would be the best socks ever made if I had huge Mountie style Canadian calf muscles. But, I do not. So, these socks tend to slip down on my legs, which is their only drawback. IMO, they need a snugger fit at the top.I highly recommend this item. I plan to buy more for friends and family. If you're going to be the sock guy at Christmas, do it right."
3,warm and soft but slouchy,"These socks are warm, thick and soft, but I think the sizing information on the Amazon web site is inadequate. I have very average sized women's feet - size 7 - so I ordered these socks in the ""women's"" size. They are too big. The heel in the sock is almost an inch past my heel, and the socks are always loose-to-falling-off when I am not wearing shoes with them. Unfortunately, I ordered several pairs of these socks at once, based on the great product reviews. Now I have a lot of socks that are too big to be entirely comfortable."
2,Disappointing quality for the price,"The socks are nice and warm, but the quality of the material and stitching is suspect. I just got the socks that I ordered, and have already had problems with loose strings. I wonder how they will hold up even with light use. For the price, the build quality should be a lot better."
4,Warm Feet in Grand Blanc,These socks are great for working and playing outside. They are as good as they were advertised to be
5,"Gorgeous book, I recommend heartily !","I love this book, whilst it is a book of literal feasts it is also a visual feast.This book with it's brushed velvet cover is organised into the main Wiccan festivals and describes relevant and gorgeous foods to make for each. Along with that there are some great spells all related to eating, feasting and jollificating.I am a bad cook too but the recipes are not particularly hard and there is a recipe for chocolate terrine that is to die for. It really does have some great ideas for making a Pagan dinner party extra special- whether for a whole gathering or a table for two.I like Titania Hardie's books, they are just so beautiful.10/10 for gorgeous and appropriate photography."
1,Reading Problems,"I bought the book brand new, which was suppose to come with a code to be able to access the website, but the code was not included. Now I have to purchase a code separately???? Where is my code?"
1,Not a great purchase,This item was delivered at a wrong address because of the mail-man's mistake. Had very hard time finding and getting the item back.
3,The Smartest Koala Cartoon EVER,"Does anyone know where I can find the whole series of this cartoon? I remember watching it as a kid and being absolutely fascinated by some of it's concepts. It's one of the earliest shows I can remember watching with a pretty decent story arch than ran through the series (especially late in the series where it got into some pretty heavy drama about dimensional merging). A lot of the early Nickelodeon cartoons where way ahead of their time in that regard and sadly, it's seems that children's programming has simply devolved into babysitting our collective ADHD kids with either total immaturity or repeating basic preschool concepts in an attempt to educate.Let's bring back shows like this that can really stimulate a child's mind (with subtle quantum theory). And yes, I am still talking about the Noozles, don't let the dopey VHS box art fool you. This show was deep."
3,Uneven tribute to Buddy Holly,"This was The Hollies' last proper album (aside from the maligned '83 reunion with Nash that had just 3 good tracks, and the recent ""Staying Power"", which had only one standout track, ""Suspended Animation""), and also their second album to contain songs exclusively by one writer. Like the Dylan album, this would have been better if the best four tracks had been released as an E.P. instead of a full-fledged LP. The good ones are ""I'm Gonna Love You Too"", ""Wishing"", and the rockers ""Midnight Shift"", and Think It Over"", which feature some good vocalizing by Allan Clarke. The remaining tracks are a bit too bland and unexciting. Not an LP to play repeatedly, but the four tracks mentioned are well-done covers and work well. The wishy-washy production tends to get in the way of the other tracks, as well as them being a bit too overly-familiar."
3,hollies salute buddy holly.,The hollies at this point were hitting a strange period.their ability to release new material was stumbling and this while a interesting disc should have been put out on the same year as a proper release. The group did a fine job with buddys songs here though. It's just like most tribute cd's not as interesting as a cd of new material or record back in those days would have been.The group does deliver strong harmonies and good playing though as you would expect.
5,Hollies covering Buddy Holly,I had this album when it first came out and have been waiting for it to come out reasonably priced on CD. Classic Hollies harmonies for all of you Posies fans and great interpretations of the Holly catalog.
3,"Nothing exceptional, but a good entry into chapter books for preschoolers.","Recycles a lot of standard fairy tale tropes (kid knows more than parents, innocent yet also devious fantasy friend of human child, blustery yet harmless monster duped into its own demise by attacking its reflection in the water, etc.). Nothing terribly objectionable while nothing terribly inspiring. It's a fairly safe entry point into chapter books for pre-readers, as there is more space devoted to pictures than text."
4,Can't get SLR results with a point & shoot,"I knew it was a long shot, but I ordered the lenses in this kit hoping to avoid a DSLR purchase. The result is that if you don't use the flash, you can get decent results with these lenses. However, in a low light setting, the barrel of the lens obstructs the flash resulting in a shadow on the right side of the image.Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase. This is a lot of gear for a small price and the seller was great to work with."
3,Second Album From Carole,"This was Carole Bayer Sager's second album, and it is not as bad as the previous reviewer thought it was. Michael Jackson fans will recongize ""It's the Falling in Love"" from Off the Wall, recorded here a year earlier with Toto's David Hungate and Steve Lukather on bass and guitar, David Foster (who co-wrote the tune) on keyboards plus Bill Champlin and Michael McDonald on backing vocals. Also included is ""To Make You Smile Again"" co-written with Melissa Manchester who also co-wrote ""Peace in My Heart"". Alice Cooper makes a guest appearance on ""Shadows"" co-written with Bruce Roberts whose albums Carole also contributed too.The songs might not live up to those on her first album and she would only release one more album1981's Sometimes Late at Night after this before going back to the world of songwriting. Perhaps she wasn't as great as a singer as Manchester or her other peers, but she does have a distinctive voice."
2,A little light for potatoes,"We hoped this would work well for making ""scraped potatoes"" (grated potatoes fried like a pancake), but it is to light weight and took longer than the traditional grater (board type). Would probably work well for cheese or other softer types of grating.."
1,Speaking Amish,"All this book is, is some made up words that the author pretends are Amish. If you want to learn Amish, don't buy it."
2,"Poorly drawn, expertly written","Judgement Day is a great comic if you completely forget the horrible drawing and weak storytelling of artist Rob Liefeld. The reason I gave this 2 stars is that even because the story is so well written by Alan Moore, the art drags it down to the point where its hard to read through because Mr.Liefelds shoddy grasp of anatomy and telling a story are more sophmoric than the work of an art student in his first year of art school. Its like paying to watch a movie with a good story only to have to sit through bad special effects, weak acting and piss-poor cinematography. Skip out on this one or better yet, borrow it or read it at a comic store but its not worthy of your money unless you find it for a bargain. Poor Alan Moore."
1,Judging Resolution not Content,"Unfortunately I can only review the format not the content of the book at this time. I got the Kindle version of this graphic novel to see what it is like reading a graphic novel in the virtual world. I tried it out on the Kindle app for my Android phone. No surprise that the screen there is to small to read. However, reading is extremely difficult even on the Kindle for PC program I installed on my computer with a 15"" screen. Does not want to make me shell out $200 for the Kindle Fire to see if somehow that might be any better resolution on its 7"" screen. Oh, well I guess for $6.99 I saved myself from spending $200 needlessly. After I get a copy of this graphic novel printed on paper, hopefully I'll have a chance to review the actual work itself - I loved Alan Moore's Watchmen and I'm looking forward to be able to read what he came up with on this novel. Unfortunately that will not be on anything Kindle-related."
1,"Hate to say it, but the formatting ruins the book","In print this seems like it would be a great book. Unfortunately, on the Fire it's almost impossible to read. The default view isn't legible and can't be zoomed. A double tap lets you view the pages as images-this enables zooming but you have to close each page to view the next. No swipes or tap to turn pages. I'm sure comic fans would have a fit, but this would work much better if Amazon broke up the panels onto individual pages. So, five stars for the novel itself but only one for the electronic version."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A compilation of some issues of the end of Youngblood it seems, with cameos out the wazoo. Savage Dragon, Supreme, and others. A mystical storybook that can change history is at the heart of the mystery, and allows some homages to dc and old characters galore, as well as for Moore to make some comments about the state of comics at the time.There is some really nice work by Gil Kane in the back showing some short adventures of some of the 'old school' Allies superteam."
2,Visionary Writer Teams Up With Talentless Hack. The Result...,"It must have been frustrating for visionary writer Alan Moore to turn out such amazing scripts and to then see them realized through the hands of Rob Leifeld. It is akin to handing the keys to a Maserati GranTurismo to a twelve-year-old girl. The result is an amazing car wreck on paper. In the hands of a competent artist, Judgment Day would have made for a fine addition to anyone's comic book library. What we have here is something that is best hit with the DISCARD stamp and sent into the recycle bin."
2,Just OK,"Maybe I have come to expect more from Alan Moore, but this one didn't excite me like Promethea or Watchmen."
3,Good cheesy and predictable movie,"Nice movie for kids, even for adults, if you're in the mood for a cheesy and predictable plot. I knew exactly what to expect when I watched this movie, and I wasn't disappointed. The plotline is tired, you've seen it all before, but the dog is likeable and there are a lot of gratifying tear jerking moments in this film (with ultra dramatic music of course), and this is exactly what a movie like that is supposed to do. So if you like dogs or are in a mood for a cheesy feel-good movie, give Air Bud a try."
2,Air Bud,"I was sent the correct case, but the wrong movie was inside. I did receive a refund, but my son is still without his movie."
5,It's the Same...!,"Whenever I ordered ""Air Bud - The Dog Is In The House"", I was a little concerned as to what I was getting. The details were a little fuzzy as to whether this was the actual original ""Air Bud"" movie on DVD. I went ahead and ordered it though and I was not disappointed: this is a nice edition of ""Air Bud"" with just a different cover (as far as I can tell). Anyway, I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,Air Bud rules,"Very nice movie. I watched it when I was 10 years old and I just loved the Gloden Retriver Bud. It's great, no volence and a must buy DVD if you want something different."
3,"Tears,excitement,and hope","This movie is sad,exciting,and hopeful. Its sad because of how that dumb clown (the original owner of air bud) treats him badly. . That dog doesnt belong at the circus! He belongs on the court,or the field. Thats basicly what its about. The dog wonders into this young teenager boys yard and the boy helps take all the rags of him and feeds him pudding. The dog keeps coming back and back intil' the question of each day is ''Mom?...Can I keep him?''. Wonce the clown finds out where is dog is and who is now taking care of him he brings them to court. ''The dog is to go to who ever he does. Began calling'' said the judge. The dog goes to the clown and tears up his newspaper then runs as fast as he can to the kid. Good classic film but not as good as Air Bud World Pup which is air bud's latest movie."
3,air bud is the best dog performance,i tthink this movie is cute. sure it may be a liitle unbelivable but most disneys movies are. the dog is so cute.kevin zegers is also good. i will alaways love this move.ps to buddy where ever you are now in doggie heavaen you fans will miss you you will always be in our hearts.
3,Way overpriced,"The movie is quite good. The video and sound quality are OK. I fail to understand why a DVD with virtually no worthwhile bonuses (other than a narrated alternative track), can be sold at such ridiculously high price. Also, how come Disney went through the effort without considering a Blu-Ray version? I don't have the previous DVD release to compare against to, but clearly this is a rip-off."
2,Botswana safari,I bought this map because I was going on safari in the Moremi area of Botswana. It is an attractive production but it proved to be not useful for my purpose. It does not show the dirt roads used by the Land Rovers so you can not use the map to see where you have been (or are going).
4,"Fun for kids, not a durable as I had hoped","My boys love these sleeping bags, and they were a true blessing as we were in the process of moving across the country, when we finally got our beds, they wanted to keep the sleeping bags instead! But after I'd say three or four washings the seams started comming apart, at the zipper and on the inside. One is worse than the other - almost unusable. If these were for ocassional use and washed less often they might hold up better, as we did use them for a few months straight."
3,"Ok, but ...","The cable works in Digital Dual-DVI (2560x1600). It is a little stiff.I have not used the cable with the analog (VGA) Signal, so I can'tcomment on that.Note: There are different versions of the cable under the same Belkinpart number. Some do have a ferrite and some don't. It's not Amazonsfault tough, Belkin's part number is the same. So Belkin is maximizingthe profit by not adding ferrites to all models. The price is on thehigh side ($2/1ft) you can get similar cables for less than $1/1ft.However, the cable works fine for me.Addendum 10/15/2010:One of the cables actually seems to have flaky soldering joints.I'm not too excited about the build quality ...."
1,Increase your child's vocabulary,"If you were planning to serve your eager children a half cup of chilled but still liquid half&half; with sugar and seaweed in it but thought making them wait a half hour first would increase the enjoyment, fine. But don't bother buying this item because the assembly, clean up and expense are a waste of your time and money. Two cautions: Because it is a child oriented activity it is not for those who use the occasional swear word and everyone should wear safety goggles in case you decide to smash the device into even more pieces.This review is based on several trials. Thanks for the refill packs, gift giver."
1,Don't Waste Your Time & Money!!,"Where do I start? This toy is absolutely awful. My son got this toy for Christmas and neither my husband nor I could put it together. After trying and trying, we finally got it but it leaks. I just read the other reviews and it seems as though most everyone else agrees--do not buy this for your kids. Be sure to read the other reviews, they list everything wrong with this toy. Here are just a few things...--hard to follow assembly instructions--leaks water from ice cubes--makes very little ice cream (barely 1/4 cup)--needs a lot of salt (3/4 cup everytime)--hard to crank--bores child while watching parent try to put it together--it has to be completely taken apart again to washI could go on but in short, not worth the time or money.Make homemade sundaes with your kids and they will have a lot more fun!!"
1,Horrible Toy,My daughter requested this toy from Santa and he delivered. The toy was extremely frustrating. It did not work properly and was difficult to assemble (couldn't make it stop leaking). Would not recommend buying this as your child will be disappointed in the results.
1,What a Waste of Money,This thing does not even fill half the cup after cranking it for 6 minutes!!!!! I love how they have in the picture a Mcflurry filled to the top of the cup. That would probably take about 25 minutes to do!!! I would rather go to McDonald's and buy my kids the McFlurry instead!! They were so annoyed with it after we did it one time they weren't even interested in it anymore!! What a Waste!! I plan on selling it at my next Garage Sale!Don't bother with it unless you want to be cranking the thing for an hour!!!
2,it sucks...,"The McFlurry is a cool idea, but I ended up putting the toy together instead of the kid I bought it for. And I didn't screw in a certain part tight enough so all the mcflurry dripped out everywhere. Plus they only give you enough for one mcflurry and the end product isn't even enough to fill the cup. the picture is very misleading. It tasted good, that's about the only thing going for it. In my opinion, I would rather have gotten the kid a bunch of McDonald's gift certificates for a real mcflurry isntead of the toy."
2,Save your money on this piece of junk,"Ugg, what a piece of you know what. It's easy enough to put together, but it's so hard to turn because the handle and spinning mechanisim seem to grind and do not turn smoothly. It takes about 6 mintues for the half & half to become ice cream consistancy, but that's a lot of turning for what little bit of ice cream this ends up making--my arm was killing me. It does taste much like a McFlurry and my 4 year old was thrilled with the results, but it's just too much of a pain to make and the product is not sturdy enough for me to recommend. Make a trip to McDonalds and buy a McFlurry from them; your arm will thank you."
1,Don't Bother!,"This toy was so bad that I am giving it away to Goodwill and it is only 1 month old. It is hard to put together, and even then it leaked! Even my husband who is a mathematician found it to be frustrating!My kids totally lost interest due to my frustration level with the whole thing.Why so many pieces for such a simple concept? My regular ice cream maker has four pieces, and works like a charm. We will be using that in the future."
1,McMess,The crank was noisey and hard to turn. The unit leaked on the bottom. The McFlurry tasted salty. I used it once with my child and trashed it!
4,This toy IS fun,"If you're looking for a toy with educational value, this isn't it. But if you want something a 6 year-old can have fun with, be a little creative and (literally) enjoy the results of his/her efforts this does the trick. My 6-year-old daughter talked incessantly about wanting this for Christmas, and at $24 it was a lot less expensive than some of the other things she wanted, so.......We used it the next day and she loved it. Her arm got a little tired after a while and I did most of the mixing but she was able to help with everything else. Messy? Sure. But so what? A few paper towels and it's taken care of. And it washes up easily. The directions are simple to follow and the kids have a blast with it. Isn't that what toys are supposed to be about?"
1,McFlurry Disappointment,My husband and I couldn't even get this to work! It was leaky and messy. The directions were difficult to follow.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!,"This piece of junk is such a waste of time and money.It requires 3/4 cup HALF AND HALF and 3/4 cup salt everytime you want a giant 1/2 cup serving!You need to disassemble the entire 12 piece unit EVERY time you use it for cleaning. Afterward you need to reassemble to use it again and the whole routine over and over again. I am really glad that each serving is a child size but, why not make the cup MUCH smaller to make it look like they are getting a huge serving like in the picture!I just finished cleaning the thing and rushed over to the computer to try to save someone else the hassle and aggrevation.Buy your child $30 worth of McDonald's gift certificates and swing buy when you want a McFlurry. Trust me, it will be more often and a lot less time consuming!"
1,Save Your Money,"My daughter begged for this toy so she could make McFlurries. What a waste of money. The crank was so difficult to turn that I even gave up on it. In addition, the end product would fill 1/4. The picture shows this BIG milkshake like product, but what comes out is a drippy 1/4 cup of cream like mixture. McDonalds should be embarrassed to have their name on this toy. I won't even sell it at the garage sale, its going into the garbage."
3,McDonald's McFlurry Maker,"It made a decent birthday gift for a nine year old , but looked a bit flimsy, and am not sure where refills can be gotten"
1,yuck!!!!!!!,"this thing is the cheatest thing ive ever seen in my life. it takes for ever to assemble it and then the cheap plastic is the worst of its kind!!! a WWE wrestler would have troble stirring it. you need stuff from home like vandillinium and rubidum just to make an ounce of the stuipid ice cream that tastes like something that was scraped of the underside of a boot!!!! when we finnialy got it all craned out, we only got a spoonful and it was a orange color so i didnt try it. plus, you can only make it 2 times before you have to burn more money to buy refills. DO NOT BUY IT IS A PEICE OF JUNK YOU SHOULD WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A BOOK TITLED THE HISTORY OF JUNK AND BORING SCIENCE. IT WOULD BE ALOT BETTER THAN THE CHEAP JUNK THAT MCDONALDS IS TRYING TO SELL JUST BECAUSE THEY ARENT DONING SO GOOD IN THE BURGER BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Lots of fun and yummy,"I almost let some of the bad reviews I read here scare me off, but my eight year old really wanted this. I disagree with what many others have said. I had no trouble setting it up -- we used it very successfully the first time. No leakage. No problems. My eight year old had no difficulty in turning the crank -- five minutes is a bit long for him, but sharing the work was half the fun. As for the portion size, I have no problem with small portions for small kids. Three quarters of a cup of soft serve is more than sufficient. The taste was perfect and the time together was even better. I would definately recommend it."
1,Not what we expected,"My 8-year-old received this for a Christmas present. He was very excited, until we tried to use it, very disappointing. As mentioned before by other reviewers, I had to put it together, and turn the crank. The box says 4 to 6 minutes, I cranked for 10 and the mixture didn't freeze well at all. We also had salt water everywhere and I had to run to the sink with it so that it didn't drip all over my kitchen floor. My son said that it did taste good, but it wasn't worth the wait. We could have gone to our local McDonald's and bought a real Mcflurry in the same amount of time."
1,Don't bother,Let's see... It takes 10 minutes to clean before using it. Another 10 minutes to clean after using it. The child refuses to turn plastic crank for 5-6 minutes. Very flimsy product. Save your time and money and drive to McDonald's. If you want to make ice cream buy a real ice cream maker.
1,This Toy Is Absolute Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Anyone who says that this toy is fun, enjoyable or easy is lying. Those people must work for McDonalds or something. Not only do you waste all of your salt for no apparent reason, but the little bit of imitation McFlurry that comes out is just terrible. I had to stand on the machine to get the mixture out. This is by far the biggest waste of money I have ever encountered and anyone who buys it should be slapped. Save yourself the trouble and just buy McFlurry's from McDonalds when you want one. Thank you."
1,Don't buy. Not worth it.,"My husband bought this for my kids, ages 6, 3, and 2. First it was a pain to put together. We had to go online to figure out how to put it together. Then my disappointed kids had to wait until I went to the grocery store to get cream for the mix. It should say it on the box somewhere. Then I turned the crank for what seemed like hours and only get vanilla tasting cream with bits of &amp;quot;McFlurry&amp;quot; in it. My kids were disappointed. I'm sticking to my &amp;quot;adult&amp;quot; Smoothie maker to make the kids treats."
1,This is a Mc Freaking Cluster F,"I read the instructions several times and my kitchen is now covered in half and half. The only educational value my children got was learning a couple new vocabulary words from a very frustrated Parent. After you read the instructions and the kids are all excited, you find out that each packet only makes like a spoonful, and there are only 2 packets in the box. We are taking this back tomorrow. Please don't waste you money."
2,"""What a disappointment!""","My 5 year old received the McFlurry Maker for Christmas, she was so disappointed in the results it produced. For starters, the handle was very hard for her and her 8 year old sister to crank,and when the 6 minutes of cranking were finally over they wereboth so excited to try the finished product and were both verydisappointed when the cup wasn't even half full! They did like the taste of the McFlurry even if it was only two spoonfuls each!Anyone would be better off buying a ""real"" ice cream maker.Don't waste your money on this product!!!"
1,McDonalds Mcflurry Maker and refills,"This McFlurry maker is GARBAGE! Our 5 yr old daughter received this for xmas and my husband had to assemble it first (instructions weren't very clear)...then we followed the directions and got only 1/3 cup really slushy goop! So we thought maybe we did something wrong, and went through the process with intsructions again. Nope---- we didn't do anything wrong.....it is a waste of money....and a complete piece of junk. ...(and yes, Toys R Us took it back with my comments attached). Money definitely spent better on something else! A real aggravation to clean too! The idea of it is awesome, but it doesn't work. BEWARE BUYERS!!! We can't even believe that McDonald's allowed their logo on this item. Note-- the only reason we rated this even 1 star is because this silly comment system doesn't give you the option for anything but scale 1-5 stars. I would have put (negative) -5 literally!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money/ Very Disappointing,"My sister bought this toy for my 7 year old daughter. It was quite confusing to put together. A child could definitely not do it themselves. The mess that comes with making the ice cream is ridiculous. Water, and cream leaks out of the machine. The crank is extremely hard to turn. It is a complete waste. And I agree with the people who wrote reviews...I can not believe that McDonald's would attach its name to this so-called toy ice cream maker. My child was very very disappointed. This was one of the top gifts on a her Christmas wish list. Once again, don't waste your money."
1,Part Missing,"Had I known what bad reviews this toy got, I would have never spent $$$ on it. Oh by the way, I was missing the retainer ring part and wasted half a carton of half and half and salt! So far my 8 year old is not happy!"
1,McFlurry Maker-waste of [money],"I can mess up my kitchen for free, instead of wasting $25 and gaining a whole lot of aggravation! I tried to find the mfg's website to complain, but I ended up here. This ""toy"" has such a poor design, that it's impossible to get ice cream out of it. I had cream pour out of it uncontrollably, a slushy mixture of cream and salt...but never ice cream. The pieces don't stay together, they shift around, resulting in a huge mess....This toy is just junk. You can buy alot more ice cream with the money that this thing costs, plus keep your blood pressure down!"
2,Mildly enjoyable,"- my Kitchenaid with all its attachments is far less complicated; so is the game Mousetrap, for that matter- the many parts are not dishwasher safe, per the instructions; unit is largely plastic - many small plastic parts, too- you need to purchase refill Mcflurry mixes - maybe someone could come up with a recipe to avoid the refill costs?- keep extra salt and half and half on hand (we did try heavy cream - undesirable results)- Don't lose the instructions - the parts do not dis/assemble entirely intuitively- was received as a gift for my 7 year old; we have since decided we'd buy an ice cream machine."
1,This toy stinks!,"First of all, it took 3 grown adults to put it together, and we still can't get a decent bit of ice cream from this thing!! So not worth it, take my advice, my 8 year old is so disappointed by this, it was a total waste of a gift!! NOT AT ALL WORTH IT, BUY SOMETHING BETTER!!"
1,McFlurry - McJunk!,"This was a HUGE waste of money. It took over an hour to assemble this product so that it didn't leak and then once we started making the ice cream, the inside parts leaked and salt went all through the ice cream. Plus, you had to turn a crank quite rapidly for 6 minutes and my son stopped after 1 minute. Boo to the McFlurry Maker!"
2,Disappointment,"In my opinion, this toy is not worth the money. I think it says ""easy to use"" on the box - I don't think so. My son tired quickly of trying to turn the crank and as it says on the box, the end result it not exactly like a real McFlurry. The preparation for making the McFlurry was a real pain as well and the refill packets are very expensive. I find myself in the position as another reviewer - telling my son we should take it back and get something else, but it came from Santa - very dissapointing."
2,A big mess,This was a huge mess and my 13 year old daughter was the one using it. I can't imagine a young child trying to use this.
1,not worth it,"This has been on my sons christmas list since he saw it months ago. It took quite some time to put this toy together. I thought we had won the battle when it was assembled. However, to actually get ice cream is another battle. After cleaning up the spills and cranking for 5 minutes my sons end result was a tsp. of ice cream. I am very dissappointed with this product. What a waste of time and money. Too bad it's such a dissappointment for children."
1,WHAT A DISASTER!!!,"Like the other reviewers said, it takes a grown-up a considerable amount of time to put this contraption together and handwash all the parts. Then, when we poured in the the half-and-half and the salt-water-ice mixture, everything leaked everywhere! It brought my 6-year old daughter to tears. Even if I could get my money back, it won't change the disastrous morning we had. Don't buy this toy!"
1,Deceived,"This item has several flaws:It leaks constantly.The instruction manual is terrible.The crank is very difficult to turn.The item tends to throw itself apart when you are turning the crank.The refills are expensive.It must be broken down into approximately 16 parts to be cleaned. Then you are expected to reassemble it by reversing the order of the disassembly instructions.The ""treats"" that it makes fill the cup provided to about the 1/3 mark. The picture on the box shows a cup ""mounded"" with McFlurry.The box says, ""Easy to use! Easy to clean! McKids always quality. Always fun!""Yeah, right."
1,Loser Product,"Please do not waste your money on this. The assembly of the equipment is very complex (we put together a bicycle in less than half the time). Once complete, you discover you do not use milk, but half and half, 3/4 cup, plus that much water AND salt. The crank is very difficult to turn, my eleven year old was getting frustrated. And the result did not fill up half the container they supply.The end product did not turn out as good as the original, the rainbow sprinkles were tasteless, and my son spit it out after spending close to half an hour getting everything ready. He was close to tears that it did not ""work correctly"" (as he expected).I had ""thought ahead"" and bought extra boxes of the mix, but now will use it in a real ice cream mixer where we have a little more control on the end product.You will be disappointed and your children devastated when they find their ""McFlurry"" tastes like runny custard. Save your money and buy an ice cream maker instead."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!,"You would be much better off going to McDonalds and buying a McFlurry for your child. After taking the time to wash each of the 15 or so parts by hand (NOT dishwasher safe), I had to run to the store and buy half and half, and salt. I then put all those pieces together, filled it up, and began the never ending turning spree. You have to crank the handle for at least 6 minutes. After six minutes, I had runny substance still. I had to add more ice, and crank for another 2 minutes. By now, my arms are completely worn out, and I still have a runny substance. My daughter drank it with the spoon, got it all over her, and I still had to wash each piece again by hand, and clean her up. I think I need a nap!! Don't waste your money or valuable time. You would have more quality time taking your child to McDonalds and eating a McFlurry there with them."
1,promo junk,"My 9 year old daughter received this for Christmas and today her and her 14 year old sister attempted to put it together...unsuccessfully. I came to the rescue but have to mention the the instructions only tell you step by step how to operate & clean the machine. The directions to assemble it are to work backwards from the instructions on dissassembling the machine...whose the idiot that wrote these instructions? We never were able to get this in working order as the spin/fin mechanism never fit into the spin guide; therefore, the lid did not fit correctly to even turn the crank. Finally, as everyone else has mentioned in their reviews, the cup they provide for serving is 3x's the size of the canister to make it. How disappointed my child was in this product. We will be returning it and find a product that lives up to its name and whose manufacturer isn't making money off of the McDonalds name."
1,Don't buy this product.,"I bought this for my 8 year old and what a waste of time and money. First it doesn't tell you on the box that you need salt and cream, so we opened it up only to put it back until I went to the supermarket and bought cream and salt. It was hard to put together and after it was ready to use, the mcflurry tasted aweful. It tasted like vanilla with salt in it. This product stinks and I would never recommend it to anyone."
3,A real bust,"My daughter received this for her 9th bday. She was excited and immediately wanted to give it a try. Well, I thought the directions on how to assemble were awful.It was not easy to put together at all. I'm a college grad and my brother in law is a very skilled carpenter and it tooks us a bit of figuring out.This is essentially a hand crank, plastic, ice cream maker which requires A LOT of cranking ( my daughter and niece both gave up)to end up with very little whatever a mcflurry actually is. Better off buying a real ice cream maker on sale."
1,messy,this toy is messy.it is so thick that it stays in the contanar so it wont come out the instructions say to wait and so it sticks too the container it wont clean so you have to toss it out but then i got antor one thiking maby i did somthing wrong that one broke right out of the box that was a rip off
4,Yummy!,My kids love this toy! Plus it saves me a trip to McDonalds when ever they get it in their head that they want a McFlurry! It saves me time and it is fun for the kids! They love it. We even use it to make low fat treats.
2,Was not happy,"All my 4 yr old wanted was a McFlurry Maker for Christmas. Of course I gave in and got it for him. He was thilled with the whole thing, but for the amount the expensive refills make it was not worth the money at all. At least he was happy"
2,Don't waste time on this McFlurry Machine,This is my first review that I have written and I'm only writing because I don't want anyone to waste their money on this machine. It does not work well. It produces liquid instead of a thick shake. It is a hastle and not worth owning. Read the other reviews and see what the majority says. This thing should be taken off all shelves.
1,A Huge McDisappointment,This toy was a huge disappointment. The machine was difficult to put together and leaked half and half everywhere. The instructions warned to make sure that the stopper was locked but it did no good. I finally had to put my finger underneath the unit to plug the leak while the kids cranked. My nine year old did enjoy the cranking but my eight year old almost cried when after all that work we only got about 1/3 of a cup of McFlurry. The only thing my six year old liked of the whole experience was setting the kitchen timer so we would know how long we had cranked. Anybody need any half and half?
3,Christian Olivares review,"The Dragons Cauldron is an interesting book because it includes very extraordinary things. It includes action, magical by the magical creatures and places, and is very suspenseful. Even though it has is awesome things it is very sad due to a person has to sacrifices himself.In the story the dragon's cauldron it has 4 main characters. There is Monkey, Civet, and Princess Shimmer. Their quest was too find the cauldron to bring water back to Shimmers home. The problem was that civet took the water so she could save herself.I really think this book was very interesting because it had very exciting chapters. Laurence Yep's writing puts a good picture in my head. The parts were suspenseful, heart pounding, and entertaining. This book will very much be about adventure. So if you like adventure, exciting, and suspenseful books, then you should check out the Dragons Cauldron."
2,Nothing to write home about,like one of the reviewers said-first two chapters ok then starts going downhill. All it is a summary of what other people wrote about the pole shift. I was already familiar with Velikovsky's and Hapgood'd theories but the rest is downright ridiculous. i could care less about various crackpots and clarivoants that he quotes. What I was expecting was some scientific theories and I certainly didn't get much in that department. don't waste your money.
2,A little frustrating,"The tent looks great and fits on a twin bed with a bit of tugging and mattress wrestling, but the construction is a bit lacking. The tent poles must be secured into `pockets' at the base of the four corners. I use the term pocket loosely, however, as these more closely resemble flaps. As such, they do not secure the poles in place at all well. It's possible to fiddle and cajole the poles into the proper position, but in the end they always pop out."
2,Smells bad hard to keep in one piece,hard to get air inside the tent also was scared i might suffocate =( i might try to get a refund or return this but was really hoping it would work better to reduce light around my bed. the hole in the top is small and doesnt work well either and lets in light and there is no other real ventilation on corners etc.
4,My kid really likes it...well kind of,This is really a good bed tent. The only issue we are having is it gets a little hot at night.
3,"OK, but not very sturdy","This tent was a gift for my 8 year old son. We put it together and placed it on his bed, within the first week we had trouble. The ""poles"" did not stay in the corners, and after we tied it really tight so it would stay better, the one side ripped! All within one week. The company needs to put reinforcements in the corners and some sort of pockets for the poles, as there are none.The quality is poor in my opinion. I also purchased a cottage one for my daughter and it had pockets for the poles and I have had no problems with it yet!"
3,"Fun, but...","My boys love playing in this tent. The unfortunate thing (which I read in other reviews before we purchased it) is that the poles come out of their pockets all the time. Because I expected this, I will make an adjustment to it with my sewing machine, make the pockets deeper and more snug. The reason they come out of the pockets is that the tent creeps down the corners of the mattress, which pushes the poles up. I wish they'd done their research a little better before selling this. Now we are responsible for making adjustments...not fair. Hopefully all will go well when I try to fix it. Otherwise... the strings to tie the doors back are useful. And I think the tent will hold-up well if not abused."
2,Never buy,I bought the winterberry dishes and I would NOT suggest anyone buy them. They are turning black in the dishwasher. I might have to just throw them away.
5,"Great Product, Great Deal, Fast Delivery","My wife and I ordered this on Dec 21 and did not expect to receive it until between January 2nd and 9th. We selected the free super saver shipping and saved $29.18. It shipped on the December 22nd arrived on the 26th. Could not beleive how fast it arrived. We entertained with this beautiful set on New Years day. We also ordered 12 extra plates, salt and pepper shakers, sugar and creamer set. This all arrived in 3 boxes in perfect condition. Amazon also had a special going that applied an addtional $25.00 off for this order. I could not get this deal directly from Pfaltzgraff's website. We received many compliments. I have been an Amazon customer since 1999 and have never been dissapointed."
5,Beautiful!,My sister just remodeled her kitchen & dining room & finally has increased storage area...I've had holiday dinnerware for years & now she had room to store it....so the women of the family got together & bought her the works! Service for 16 & many of the complimentar pieces. She loves it & it looks absolutely beautiful on the table!You can't really go wrong with Pfaltzgraff.
5,Dinnerware star quality,I didn't know what to expect when I ordered the Pfaltzgraff dinnerware from Amazon but the 2 sets arrived on time and in perfect condition. I saved lots of bucks and got just what I wanted. Thanks to Amazon!
1,Dump Days,This book was very bad all it was boring. It was like hey I found a mole wow lets start a zoo. It was not Jerry Spinelli's better book.
3,IT DOESNT WORK FOR ME,"Grant is a competent technician but his tale fails to scare me. It starts off slow and tapers off. If Grant was writing jokes, this one would have no punchline.If you get upset about anything and everything, it might work for you."
3,$64 for a pdf file?,$64 for a pdf file? Are you insane? This one can't even be read on a handheld device!
1,totally false advertisement...,Looking at it you would think that you were getting all 4 what they don't tell you is that you only get 1. This is false advertisement do not order!
4,Richly Drawn Folk Stories and Natural Wonders,"I am working my way through the series. This book is one of my very favorites after the landmark Everglades: River of Grass. Matschat brings a botanist's eye to the 1930's Okefenokee swamp and its inhabitants. Numerous evocative descriptions of what makes the Okefenokee unique and worth preserving. The remainder of the ""journey"" down the Suwanee is interesting but it is the Okefenokee section that gives this book my high rating."
5,Beautiful picture book,"Pandora is a beautifully illustrated and poetic book that introduces young people to the foundations of western culture. The Greek myths hold many origins to our modern understanding of human behavior and character. Robert Burleigh has done a beautiful job of bringing this myth to life. As a teacher, I highly recommend this book for grade elementary school or middle school. Although you have to order it from outside sources, it's worth it."
1,No shame!,"ZERO STARS for this musical pothole of a collection!K-TEL duds it again, with their disco set, GOOD GROOVIN'. These are literally some of the lamest remakes ever to escape and flee from a recording studio. Whoever came up with the concept of tarnishing Top 40 hits by redoing them in the worst possible manner should be forced to listen to them 24 hours a day. (Can you say, ""YUCK!""?)"
1,DO NOT ORDER THESE STAIRS!!,"We ordered these stairs for our dog because the photo matches a set of stairs we have had for several years. We looked quite a while to find stairs that have one continuous strip of carpeting going up, instead of carpeting only on the base of the step. When they arrived, they were not the same stairs shown in the picture, even though they arrived with a label that showed the same picture as the one listed on Amazon, with one continuous strip of carpeting. Our dog will not use them, as the carpeting is only on the base of the step. I called Solvit Products and they blamed Amazon for having an outdated photo, while stating that even though they haven't made the stairs in YEARS, they have not updated the photo on their own labels either. REALLY? What a waste of time and energy for us!! False advertising."
3,"Good, but predictable","Mercury rising was a good book, but I felt that it was somewhat predictable. But I loved all the action scenes. I've never heard of Ryne Douglas Pearson before, but he is a great author and I would definately read another of his books."
2,a shoddy cash-in,"Although this translation doesn't have the annoying archaisms ('twas, thou art, 'tis etc) of the Wainhouse/Seaver translations, this one is faithful to the tradition of dodgy 1960's Sade translations that omit the philosophical discussions that distinguish Sade's texts from any other sort of pornography. Almost unbelievably, the mock-serious philosophical pamphlet included with Sade's Philosophy in the Bedroom- easily the most interesting part of the work, is missing- because ""Meredith X"" (the translator) has decided that it disrupts the 'continuity and flow' of the text. In the body of the translation itself there are in fact words and phrases absent from the French.(ie 'Crimson! F...ing Goat of Satan! etc) And at the end of the book there is a section transplanted from the 120 Days of Sodom- more or less a catalogue of tortures and degradations. An appalling cash-in."
4,Worth viewing,"There's some really useful 3D systems-engineering material in this book, although it could have been better edited for consistency/uniformity - - and rather better polished before publication."
5,celtic culture,"I have a library copy of this book but I have not yet finished reading the book. This is an excellent book. The first introdution is in German and the second introduction is in English. There are hundreds of pictures with English and German captions, showing archaeological sites, and objects primarily found in graves. I had thought that the Celts were mostly in Ireland and England but the center of culture was spread over a wide part of continental Europe. Various pictures clearly show the influence of Scythians (gold objects) and Greek culture. I will eventually buy a copy of the book."
4,A wonderful trip of Scotland and her music,"The Alexander Brothers have been around for many years and theirpride of both their country and music will endure forever.A must for those that wish to see the splendid scenarios of thecountryside Scotland has to offer but also the inspiring and magical feel that Tom and Jack can make you envision and transcend into.Along with other recordings these fine men have put forth, theirrespected tributes and toasts to Andy Stewart and Jimmy Shand,religion and others makes for an entertaining yet relaxing aurafor all individuals whether of Scot's descent or otherwise."
2,Thought-provoking but a little vague,"I have found this book to be a good jumping-off place for futher discussion with other Christian women. However, I would not recommend doing this study on your own. Nor would I try to do it without some sort of commentary. The verses that Mrs. Heald uses are often taken out of that context which is quite important for understanding them. This is not to say that it is a bad book. It just borders on vague in some areas, and does well with extensive further discussion about the passages chosen and the intention of the author in choosing them."
2,Not enough information and insight,"I was hoping for clear, concise, insightful information on becoming a woman of excellence. Instead, it contained a few scriptures and workbook exercises for the reader to do it herself. Not enough revelation into God's view of a woman of excellence."
2,Monopoly,The delivery time was very long. It was not what I expected when I got the product. It was gift for someone and they have not been able to use it at all. Glad I bought them another gift.
1,Brilliant and stunning!,I believe in the every growing rate of sophistication in our country and I'm sure with books like this we can take our government more seriously
3,The movie was better,"Mostly I much prefer the Bond books over the movies, but this is the exception for me. The plot is more pedestrian and not as grand. The bad guy not quite as scary. Still a good book but I loved the movie."
4,Kindle Edition,"The book, of course is all I remember, but Amazon or the publisher needs to fix the typos in the Kindle edition. They usually occur on the Japanese proper names or some Japanese words, and I'm not being picky. Some of the words have symbols or wingdings instead of letters. I'll feel a lot better about e-books when I know they're as heavily proofread as print books."
3,Thank God Fleming Wrote The Man With the Golden Gun,"The end was such a letdown. Yet after reading this book twice, I knew Fleming was going to write Bond out of his helpless state. The part about killing Blofled was superb, yet Kissy keeping him on Kuro was such a bad writing move."
1,Forget it,"For me, that can't be Bond! After writing such a masterpiece as OHMSS, Ian Fleming did this to all of us: No action, no fun- where is James Bond?"
3,Is this Bond?,"After such a great, strong story of OHMSS, it is hard to believe that Feming would write such a depressing novel like YOLT. However, it is very believible that Bond would be so upset after the death of his wife. The book is nothing like the movie and to tell you the truth, I enjoy the movie more than the book. The only things that remain constant between book and the movie are the Japanese setting and the characters. It is a good book, but lacks a good ending. No Bond book is without merit, however, and YOLT does provide good supporting characters. TOLT is still better than some of the other books in the series and I still would recomend reading it."
4,An Englishman in the Far East,"Fleming's tale of James Bond's search for vengance is a fascinating journey into Japan's past and (early Sixties) present. There is some remarkable detail in this book about the history of the Ninjas. In fact this book is may be the first popular introduction of the Ninjas to the West.In addition, there is an exceptional section detailing the history of the Kamikaze pilots and the damage they inflicted during the Second World War in the Pacific. Fleming's background as a journalist and later a Naval Intelligence officer in the war provided him with the ability to provide a colorful perspective.The writing is crisp and fast-paced, as in most of the Bond books. Some people may find asppects of the ending somewhat disappointing, but I found Bond's psychological journey through this story to be intriguing."
3,"Oriental caper climaxes well, then ends flaccidly","The research for this book is admirable. Reading it,one really almost feels as if he's taken his own personal tour of Japan.The cultural study is very interesting as well, but the story itself drags a bit.Once Bond lands on Kissy Suzuki's(where does Fleming come up with these names!) Island, things move at a snail's pace. After ""Bondo-san"" lands on Shatterhand's island, though, the excitement picks up quite nicely. The almost dreamlike quality of the island of death was really fascinating.As the action led to the final showdown, the suspense grew, and I found the climax riveting and quite well-envisioned. The epilogue , however, would have been best if it had been left unwritten.What a flaccid denoument.All in all, an enjoyable read, and it's detractions should not keep one from checking it out.Welcome to Japan!"
4,"A Must read for fans of the Film ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""","If you are fan of the bond film ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" this is a James Bond book you must read!!!The bond film series failed to create proper continuity from OHMSS to Diamonds are Forever. This left fans without any concept or feel of the how Bond might react after the tragedy that occured in OHMSS.Thankfully the novel version of picks up up perfectly from that moment and provides Bond fans with a truly satisfactory conclusion to Bonds fight against SPECTRE."
2,The Ending Almost Gave Me a Heart Attack!,"Why? Why, did he do this to Bond? He left the all powerful Bond, without a memory in a strange place, and everyone including M, thought he was dead? What's the deal? However, this books earns it's two stars from the events just before the end. When, Bond sneaks around Dr. Shatterhand's (Blofeld's) castle. I'm just glad the ending in the book, wasn't portrayed in the movie. Now, that I think about it though, this book is absolutly nothing like the movie!"
5,Grimm Jack,"This is Ian Fleming's most mysterious and enigmatic James Bond novel. This is a direct follow up to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" It starts out as a direct secret service story but as it progresses becomes almost surrealistic as James Bond tracks down his arch nemesis. This is a very well written and researched novel. The Japanese idioms and depictions of locale are exquisite. When the novel moves to Kuro Island and is on the threshold of Dr. Shaterhand's castle lair, Fleming approaches mythical horizons. I found this absorbing, haunting and prophetic novel very difficult to put down once I started reading it. If you do decide to read it I recommend that you read ""Thunderball"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" first. I will go one step further, if you read both of these novels then read ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" after ""You Only Live Twice."" These four novels are inexorably connected."
4,Ian Fleming at his best,"Flemings descriptions of Blofields ""Garden of death"" are one of the best word imaging is ever read. I felt like i was there. The tenseness of Bonds hiding and waiting his chance to enter the Castle are superb."
5,A gift book that brings warmth and guidance to the reader,"I saw Sally Sharp on the NBC special: Angels II Beyond the Light and shortly thereafter purchased both 100 Ways to Attract Angels and Angel Prayers. Her words bring warmth, hope, and light. A great gift for someone in need."
3,Title was misleading,"This book I hoped would have excercises/prayers/meditations, etc. that would guide someone who has read previous materials on angels. It turned out to be really a book of inspiring thoughts and some light hearted suggestions for daily life. I did give this book to my six year old son to read along with the author's other book titled ""Angel Prayers"" and found it to be a great book for him to read alone or along with me. I just did not find it to be what I was personally looking for in a book on the subject."
1,Angels are only messengers...,"There is no Biblical proof that angels are protectors or companions. If one reads the Bible, it clearly states there roll. They were only sent to Earth as messengers. That's all!"
4,I'm a buddy of Tay's,"and hence biased. So take my word with a grain of salt.But this is an excellent, clear and lovely book, covering almost everything you need to know about GW.There are some small omissions, and a few errors, mostly centering around SSL and LDAP, which were not complete when this book was written.But for a beginner-to-advanced training/learning/reference, you cannot go wrong with this."
5,"Easy to Understand, and Great Smelling Formulas","I picked this book up quite some time ago, probably before Amazon was even around. The recipes are a great way to stick one's toes in the waters of perfume formulation.Just because they're simple recipes does not mean they are simple fragrances. One of these, ""Night"", is composed of just a few oils, yet is such a rich and heady blend that it rivals classics like Obsession or Magie Noir. I have made it for several friends who are surprised to learn it isn't a department store perfume counter purchase.Definitely worth the money for beginners, and a good addition to a more advanced perfumer's library as well.As another reviewer stated, the Picasso artwork is a nice plus, but what sticks in my mind is the way the book winds up smelling after mixing formulas from it. (Don't be afraid to spill a drop or two.)"
1,Absolute Junk,The rust starts fast! Also when you replace the bulb it doesn't just use a quick plug-you have to connect a lead wire-what a pain!
2,"For academics only. Boring academics, that is.","Strictly for academic Oakeshott scholars, and surely put together to impress only them. Clunkily written, pedantic, and of no use whatsoever for the general reader, or even the non-academic Oakeshott fan.Sample, but utterly typical, passage:""The suggestions that I have just made, that Oakeshott changes some fundamental elements of his philosphy and that among those changes is a different, more open understanding of the relationship of philosophy and practice, go against the grain of most Oakeshott scholarship.""I don't know about you, but he's sure got my head spinning, my heart pounding, and my mind wanting to read more, more."
3,"Fun read, but dated.","Masaaki Hatsumi's overview of the Japanese Ninja is a fun read that gives a fairly brief survey of Ninjutsu. As someone skeptical of the whole ""ninja thing"" I found it both informative and frustrating, that the author worked hard to dispel myths about the ninja and their powers and then turn around and wax esoteric on the very same topic.Many of the photos in the book are not particularly well taken and tend to be fuzzy and dated, and the captions do little to make them any more clear.Still, its a fun book that can be read quickly. I found the section on ninja tools particularly interesting."
3,Nice collection of history to Ninjutsu-practicioners,"This is a great book, but only for historical purposes. It doesn't really tell you *anything* but the basic history-line. I liked it, but then again, I am a ninjutsu fan myself. For others it doesn't mean a thing and I personally like Hatsumi's other books more for the content."
3,"good movie, very minimal","this is a very interesting movie for luc besson buffs, but its even more minimal than i had anticipated. its worth watching, but set aside some time to watch it as you have to be completely focussed on it to follow it."
2,unmoving,"I bought this because I like a lot of the directors movies, this was the exception. Don't waste your time on this movie, skip to more of his recent projects and you will be very happy."
3,cool movie,"the movie is pretty cool, and very nicely done for the genre....the soundtrack is awful, but the film more than makes up for that. worth the money...great to have in the collection"
3,America the Beautiful,An album that shows the ideals that Americans wish for today. Tennessee Ernie Ford has the voice that carries the emotional context that these songs represent.
3,less pages and markers,"I received the book which has 18 pages. And received only 5 markers!!!! Was disappointed. My daughter opened it immedialy, and started coloring, but for a toddler it is painful to not see colors immedialty. Once she colord, I can't return it??"
2,Not too much help for the test,Just took the DWDA exam as was surprised by how many topics are not covered very well in the book. The book definitely covers the basics but does not cover all the objectives tested in the exam.
2,Better than nothing - but not by much....,"I have specifically used Notes R4.5x to develop web applications and sites for 2+ years now and find this book very lacking. It almost looked to me as though somebody stuck together a mention of web development R4.5 enhancements and barely understood how they worked themselves. The descriptions are very misleading, key pieces of information are missing and some of the sample questions and answers seem incorrect. If you have never used the web enabling features of Notes R4.5x ($$ViewTemplates, $$fields, etc.), this book can be of some help in making you slightly aware of these commands."
4,DWDA book really did help me pass my exam,"I took this exam recently as Lotus were phasing out the old R4.x exams. I read the book from cover to cover about 5 times. The sample questions were extremely useful and some of the questions were actually in the real exam. I did notice one or two errors in the book. Overall, the book was extremely helpful."
2,Updates Exam,"I think this book covers about 60% of whats in the exam. I've taken the test and passed (just about), and I've made a few observations. A) A lot of the reviews are good, where as a lot of the reviews are bad. Going on my own experience i would say they have updated the exam since this book originally came out. B) Steve does mention another of his books throughout the text, and it may be worth getting hold of a copy of this as well. C) I wouldn't rely on this book to get you through the exam, especially if you haven't got much experience with Notes."
1,"The only book on this topic, but still a poor book","At first I thought this book will be a good book, given that McGraw Hill publishes so many books on Lotus Notes. However, after taking the exam today I find that I can find nothing similar in this book. For instance, a few questions are on CGI applications and problems with Java applets, which are not mentioned in this book. Probably Lotus has made the exam harder, and the questions in this book are very easy. However, the book gives you a hint of how to turn Lotus Domino into a web server. A good book, but not for the exam. His other book by McGraw Hill is similar but giving further details. Good for real life situation, but still not good for the exam."
5,Excellent value for money,"I found this book extremely helpful in preparing for the DWDA exam. Steve presented the material in an easy to read format with plenty of practical exercises and exam questions at the end of each chapter. I was able to pass the exam at my first attempt thanks to this book, and found it covered most topics on the exam very thoroughly.The self test exams at the back of the book were also very helpful, and even though several key exam topics were not addressed in the self tests, there are sample questions covering these areas on Steve's Website (worth checking prior to sitting the exam!)Overall, very good value for money.."
4,Several sample questions from the book were on the exam.,The book takes the exam outline from Lotus and goes into a fair amount of detail to explain each section. I passed the exam on my first try after reading the book and taking the included practice exams about three times each. The two page study sheet at the back of the book covers about 80% of the exam material. Well worth the purchase!
3,Instant tree,"The tree in itself is easy to set up and looks surprisingly good. However be careful in putting on too many ornaments. The base itself that supports the tree is flimsy and the tree can fall over very easily.However, all in all, for a quick set up and take down tree, where storage space is at a premium, then this is not a bad buy."
1,"Sticky, glue type product","sticky, glue type product. Used it and did not notice any difference on my skin."
2,Mislead by reviews of this stroller,"I spent a lot of time researching strollers, and after reading all of the reviews for the Aria I decided to register for one. Out of the box it was fairly easy to assemble and lightweight, but I have not been pleased with it since. The shoulder straps on the 5 point harness are cheap and fall out of the back of the seat. The snack cup has never stayed in place. Steering this stroller is impossible...we took it to Disney last month and I almost left it in Florida. All in all I expected a lot more from Peg Perego."
2,Works Well But ...,"The design is sleek and so far it works. The difference between the two spray settings is negligible. The body may be brass but the handle is very lightweight plastic, a real disappointment. It has no heft. Plumber who installed it said it is not the best brand and that you have to be very careful putting it together or the plastic fitting will be damaged.Update- 1+ years after it was installed, the automatic return to the regular water flow setting on the handle stopped working. Not a big thing, but disappointing. Would I buy Price Pfister again, no. Am I going to replace it, not yet. I have too much sunk in it."
1,"Call me ""non-hip""","Looking for a poetry book for my 6 year old, the reviews for this one made me think I couldn't go wrong. Guess again! The pictures are fun. Most of the poems while o.k. don't really thrill me. The real problem came while reading the title poem. As we all know kids quickly catch on to words we don't really care for them to repeat. One such word is found in this poem and while many of you may find it mild I do not care to hear the word ""turd"" coming from my son's mouth. I would definately look elsewhere for silly poetry."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,My husband looks forward to and enjoys reading this to our 3.5 year old son *every* night! Modern poetry based stories and artwork that are great for many laughs. Inspires poetry and rhymes in both by husband and son! Fun book!
2,Silly Rhymes and Sillier Illustrations,"Hmmm... silly rhymes. Not much to them, sillier illustrations, still not much to say about this book. I came across this book at our public library... Would I buy it? - I'm sorry to say, I would not. My eight year old daughter is a good ""double-check"" for me. Often, when I don't have an appreciation for a children's book, realizing I am not the intended audience, I'll ask her opinion. Unfortunately, she happens to share my opinion on this one.~DeeDee Fox, author and illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers"
4,Very entertaining and fun!,"Children's poetry books have a tendency to be bland and mind-numbing. This collection of 14 poems is a refreshing exception to that convention.Brown's poems have a unique sing-songy feel that are not childish, but hip and stylish.I highly recommend this book for kids from 5-12 years old and parents who are sick of watered-down kids' books."
5,Lovely poems,"This book is great fun! Thought provoking, funny and sometimes completely crazy poems. The illustrations are clever and interesting, and really hold my son's attention. ""Polka Bats"" is his favorite. I like ""Sleeping Fruit"" best, so mellow and relaxing. I'm so impressed that I have bought several copies of this book as presents for the other children in my family."
3,really not that good,"It's a cute book, but not really as good as I hoped it would be. My 4 yr old son loves to read books and gets very excited over them, but he just wasn't too impressed by this book. Usually he will ask to read a book he likes over and over again and this one hasn't even been mentioned since the first time I read it. I have asked him if he wanted me to read it and he said no on several occasions."
5,"Delicious, delightful, all fun and not frightful!","This book will help lure to reading youngsters who may not have previously been very interested. The sense of humor crosses age boundaries. I was surprised at the target age, because I'm 63 and can't wait to read it to my grandchildren. My husband and children are not ""safe"" either, but I know they will enjoy it, too! A review I read somewhere on this book said ""not for those with limited library funds."" I couldn't disagree more. Fun reading is healthy and worth the investment for all ages. (""You go, Calef!"") I can thank PBS in Norfolk, VA again for calling my attention to a pleasure I might otherwise have missed."
1,Defective unit shipped,"Daisy was received with missing contacts in the battery compartment. They didn't just fall out, they were gone. I can't believe they (ToysRus) would ship such an obviously defective unit. Now it is out of stock and no replacement available. A real christmas dud."
3,"Help For ""Angry Customer""","I saw this toy in a sale bin at WalMart just the other day! I noticed you live in Mass I live in NH about an hour and a half drive to Mass from my house. I belive I saw it in the Amherst WalMarts. P.S. My ratings are all 3 because that's ""Average"""
1,Don't buy this toy,I bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts. The one I bought my daughter was broken. They come with a 90 day warrenty but I do my shopping throughout the year so I had already had it for 4 months. The company refused to help me out. Now I have a crying 3 year old and a broken dog with no way of getting a working one as no where around carries these any more. Stear clear of products made by MGA they are very unprofessional when dealing with customer service. I offered them the receipt and pictures showing it wasn't opened before x-mas but they still won't honor it. The dogs that do work sometimes have faulty movements and will start walking without being prompted to walk. I hope that this keeps others from going through what I have. Any decent company would make an exception to the time limit of their warrenty.
1,Hair pulled out,"My 4 yr old received this toy from Santa and was playing with it on Christmas morning when we heard, ""Help me, Help me!! Owwie, Owwie, Stop, stop!!"" Her waist length hair became entangled in the wheels/feet of the dog, and because Daisy is sound activated, her cries for help only made the wheels turn more. I frantically turned it off but by then a decent sized chunk of hair had already been pulled out."
2,3 1/2 old hates it,"This was the one Christmas gift my daughter asked for. (""Santa, I just want the dog."") She pointed it out to me in the store. Well, after the batteries got in it she said ""I didn't like the dog."" ""It's to loud."" She will not play with it."
5,A must-have saw,"Any one with a garden with any kinds of shrubs or trees needs an effective pruning saw and this one is it. I've used it for many more larger tasks than i intended, using it essentially as a replacement for a small bow saw. It has the great advantage of being light and being able to get into tight spaces. This an a set of Felco pruners is all one needs to keep things in check."
5,graet tree saw,"This is the best small tree saw on the market. Can't beat it for durability,workmanship and staying sharp the longest."
3,Corona Clipper 14 inch saw,I was disappointed in this saw. I have had difficulty cutting semi dry wood with it. The saw teeth seem to create a very wide cut but it is difficult to cut deeply into the wood. It takes a long time and requires too much energy to be efficient.
5,Corona 14 inch curved saw #RS7395,"Great saw. Frighteningly sharp....will cut any limb, bush, etc. in my yard. I used to think my bow saw was great but this puts it to shame.I also bought a Corona pole saw with the same blade on the end....and it's terrific.My gardener recommended (and personally uses) both."
4,First of its kind on Membrane Computing!!!,"A innovative book that introduces the concepts of membrane computing, an alternative way of computation that mimics the structure and functioning of living cells. This is a new branch of computing, and though the concepts are well developed by Prof Paun (whom I have the honor of meeting in person), much work still remains to be done to bring the concepts into practical applications. Should make an interesting area of applied R&D."
2,The main mystery is how this book got published...,"Was it ghostwritten under Tremayne's name by someone with little knowledge of grammar and spelling, not to mention syle? Was it rushed through to make a fast buck? Was there no time or budget for a copy editor? Could this pseudonymous Celtic scholar really not know the difference between ""affect"" and ""effect?"" ""Lie"" and ""lay?"" Was someone trying to sabotage his reputation?I am only 1/3 of the way through Valley of the Shadow, which I eagerly anticipated, having read all the preceding ones in the series. Now, I'm not sure I can stand to finish it. While the others could have used a good editor, the stories were engaging enough that I could overlook a few mistakes for the sake of a good escape.I hope the writer and publisher heeded the critics and hired an editor for subsequent editions. I do want to continue to occasionally get caught up in Sister Fidelma's world..."
3,That Fidelma's kind of a stiff,"The interesting subject matter, and honestly, the way the paperback looks and feels, made me pick it up at Target. I have not read any other of Tremayne's works, but I was disappointed in this one. Sister Fidelma may as well be one of the stone statues that the pagan Irish used to erect at their strongholds. Not very sympathetic, and certainly one-dimensional. Her Saxon ""sidekick""(what a cliche'!) is no better, obviously trotted out to show the ""typical"" Church response to perceived superstition and pagan ritual. I know diehard mystery fans (which I am not)probably don't care about the nitpicky details, but if you're looking for a novel of ancient Ireland that rings with authenticity and not tedious pedantic observations of life in ""Dark Age"" Ireland, then run, don't walk to Morgan Llewellyn."
2,Great - But....,"The good:For making pizza or for baking small items, this works really well. If you want it just as a replacement for your toaster, then you'll be pounding a nail with a sledge hammer... Get it if you need both functions.The not so good:1) The printing on the function buttons (on - off) wore off after about a month or so. Not a big problem since we knew what the buttons were for by then.2) It runs hot for baking, etc, so plan to run it ~ 25F lower than your recipe (also not too big of a problem, once we figured it out).3) After about 3 mos, the top heating elements failed (big problem).I just called Cuisinart's customer service. They will be shipping me a new unit (7-10 days), and I'll have to return the old one back to them (along with $20 for shipping both ways). Still, their response was definitely hassle-free. I'll post a few months from now to update..."
1,More poor workmanship,"I recently bought the BRK-100 Brick Oven at another store. Upon setting it up at home I immediately noticed that the oven had a wobble to it. Close inspection showed that one of the rubber legs was a 1/2"" shorter than the other legs, it was clearly a wrong part since it was not even the same shape. This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll be buying as a Cuisinart toaster I have had one of its set of heating coils completely fail after less than a year. Some of the Cuisinart products have a nice design but their quality control and reliability has turned me off for good."
5,Great Oven,I wanted something smaller to use for cooking and this is the product. Not only does it cook great but looks great on my countertop. Cooking and/or baking is great with this product and I highly recommend it. Thanks again Amazon!
5,A nice little electric oven,Pizza cooks in less time than instructed and comes out very well. A good toaster. Easy to clean and use.
3,good but not good,The oven was not as good as I thought It is large and does not fit well on the kitchen counter. Pizza sticks to the pizza stone all the time. I dont know if it is me or the oven. Heat is great from the top coils but not from the bottom. It always cooks good on top but does not brown from the bottom. Would not purchase again.
3,Limited control,"The oven is very handy, but I find it hard to control the temperature. Perhaps it's the size of the oven. Food tends to be over-cooked at the suggested temp."
4,"A good handbook of the old ""trapper"" style of winter camping","A thorough explanation of the equipment andtechniques of winter camping before the adventof synthetic ""miracle"" fibers and gore-texWhile the style is at times boosterish, theauthor covers the subject well while managingto give warning of the dangers involved.The style of camping discussed is still in usein the far north among trappers and dog sleddersbut as far as I have been able to determine, thisbook is the *ONLY* detailed handbook of thisstyle of camping ever published.Books on lightwieght winter backpacking aboundand several practical as well as travel memoirstyle books on dog sledding are available,however no other book so thoroughly covers themundane day to day techniques of living outdoorsat fourty degrees below zero in canvas tents."
4,it grows on you...eventually,"while this cd is definitely not as good as the moon is down or how to start a fire, and while jon will never be jason or even chris, you have to put all that aside in order to appreciate this record.the ONE thing that's truly bad about this record is the fact that tracks 5 and 6 have THE EXACT SAME CHORUS. the same chords, the same pattern, the same lyrics. they literally played it twice in 2 different songs. i thought that was really stupid, but other than that this record is really great if you put aside all the natural prejudices."
2,A feeble attempt,"I have bought every Further CD and seen a show with all 3 different singers.Further Seems Forever is an amaizing band, but that speaks simply for the musicianship. And out of the 3 albums and singers they have had i cant help but notice this to be the weakest LP yet.With Chris on the Moon is Down i felt the album to be solid yet still with the EMO vibe. And this was further established through DashboardThough with Jason on How to start a fire i belive the band really found its style and voice. Amaizing lyrics that slapped you in the face.This album is soft however and i believe Further will put out another soft album and eventually be no more.They were destined for greatness, buf for reasons unknown couldnt keep the right front man in the band."
2,Warning this is christian music - what ever hapened to rock?,"Well, after 2 lead singers, FSF return with their third lead singer and now define themselves as a christian rock band.That in itself explains how weak the music is, full of preachy lyrics and insidiously religious meaning. Gone is the element that made the last 2 cds great - it's not intense or exciting, it's weak and preachy and religious. What ever happened to rock?"
2,"Doesn't Hold A Candle to ""The Moon is Down""","Hide Nothing, FSF's third album with their third career singer finds the band slipping into indy/emo mediocrity via Mr. Jon Bunch (ex. sense field) The vocals have lost their power on this album. A swift vocal kick in the pants is something you've come to expect from Further Seems Forever, and this album simply does not deliver.Stand out tracks are:light up aheadhide nothinglike someone you knowthese songs actually contribute positively to the FSF catalogue. The rest of the album I could do without."
3,I had such high expectations...,"I'll start by saying that this is the only FSF album that I own, so I have nothing to compare it to. The high expectations came from the few songs that I had previously heard off this album; unfortunately, these seem to be the only 2 standout tracks on the CD. ""Like Someone You Know"" and ""Light Up Ahead"" are absolutely beautiful, moving, eloquent songs that made me really excited to hear the rest of the album. However, basically the rest of the CD sounds very generic. I find myself unable to distinguish among the other 8 tracks, even bored at times. However, because those 2 songs are so outstanding, I don't feel like I quite WASTED my money. And, yes, I still cried myself to sleep (almost) when they announced they were breaking up."
2,Not the best..,"Very dissappointed with this.The vocals are weak: tonally not in sync with the style of music, melodies are poor and his vocal range is limited.The music is uninteresting: no original composition shifts, no anthemic chorus riffs as showcased on their previous efforts. The songs amble along without hooks or complexity.The production is inorganic and overlayered, giving the music a sterile sound.The lyrics have important messages but are not eloquently written. They sound more like a high-school student's attempt at word play.Ahhh!! What happened guys?The only thing saving this disc, if you were lucky enough to get the 'Best Buy' exclusive, is the three acoustic versions of songs on the disc."
2,...well it was a nice effort.,"I've been a big fan of FSF since Chris. On their sophmore album I was blown away by the amazing three part guitar riffs and the unforgettable lyrics. It even drove me to see them live. Then this album came out,....What the crap? No doubt, this isn't their finest work to say the least. I mean, it's not so bad that I'd recommend it as skeet for trap shooting, however, if you are a Die-Hard FSF fan then this album is for you (if for nothing else to complete your FSF library). For someone who may have only one of their firt two albums, purchase the other of the first two which you do not have and borrow this one. If you don't own any of their albums, steer clear of this one alltogether - It may turn you off to the band. If you only buy one of FSF's albums, go with ""How To Start A Fire"" - one of the best emo albums to date."
4,steller,"three albums, three singers later, further seems forever has finally fund there touch, coming from tooth and nail (anberlin, underoath) they bring a edge of emo rock that youre sure to enjoy.Maybe this time theyll keep the same singer becuase its working for them"
4,Should have changed their name,"i think they should have just changed their name after every singer. its a lot easier to like a band if u don't have a direct comparison. for instance, audioslave will never be rage against the machine but they aren't trying to be. different name different sound. fsf is awesome but i can't stack three different singers in one band. its just not fair"
4,"Solid, very solid","All I can say is 'Hide Nothing' is a good, solid album. Musically, these guys are extremely talented--their change-ups and breaks are very distinctive. The music itself holds its own. I've read some reviews stating that the lyrics are weak. Well, I don't listen to music to ponder the meanig or significance of a song. The lyrics are simple or should I say straight foward. I'm not really sure why they changed lead vocalist again--I know why Carraba left--but the new lead is different from the previous, but good as well. I do reccomend the album, but it needs to be understood that as you make line-up changes, the sound of the band may change as well. In this case---it worked out."
4,Cute and hefty,"We bought these cups for my sister's Hawaiian-themed bridal shower. They were very cute, in vibrant colors, and they were much more substantial than Solo cups. Their heft was pleasing in the hand. They added a ""classier"" touch to the plastic cup."
4,perfect for a cure,Used the cups for root beers floats for a Relay for Life. Our booth used a luau theme. The cups were perfect! We sold all the floats we could make and all the money went to the cancer society.
5,It's like she's speaking right to me!,"I loved this book. I saw Ann Miller in Sugar Babies when I was 19 years old in New York, and again later at the Dallas Music Hall. I knew when I was watching her that she was somebody very special. Her tap dancing technique is beyond compare. Her book makes me feel like she's talking to me. I wish she would have written another memoir about her life after 1972. If somebody does, I will buy it for sure. She made it by talent and hard work just likes she states in the book."
4,Great autobiography of a great star,"This personal story of MGM's great dancing star, Ann Miller, was an easy read and gave a great deal of information about show business through the years and the many entertainers she has known. It tells of her life on stage, screen and in vaudeville days,as well as her marriages and divorces and daily life. Shipping was quick and arrived ahead of the probable delivery date and the book was in excellent condition as described by the seller."
4,"""Swamp Song"" captures the essence of Florida","Ron Larson's ""Swamp Song"" is an intriguing trip through Florida's back-wood ecosystems. His writing style is descriptive and captivating. He illustrates - both through words and photographs - the unique plants and animals of Florida's swamps and rivers, and demystifies the often bleak outlook of these natural habitats."
1,Local reception only,"Works for LOCAL, that is, NEARBY stations only. Over rated. Nothing but rabbit ears with low power amp."
3,Not better than model HDTVi Terk,"First I bought model HDTVi at circuit city. This model gave me a hard time to get signal, I thought model HDTVa should do a better job because it has amplified built in but I was disappointed it didn't do any good. It is not better than model HDTVi."
1,Way too directional for my use,"*Update* Amazon did refund my money on this, it just took a while.This was supposed to be the best antenna out there, but it was showed up by a cheap RCA antenna. The Terk antenna would work, but it had to be aimed in just the right place and never would pick up all my local channels, even though they all broadcast from the same place. It is very large and sticks out like a sore thumb also. Not worth it at all. Now, if Amazon would just refund my money, I am getting tired of waiting for my refund!"
4,works as advertised,"I live on the outer range of where I can pick up nice OTA HDTV signals. So I wanted the power boost. Unfortunately, it didn't work well at first. Then I realized that you have to really push hard to insert the antenna into the base. If you pick one up, make sure you put it together properly.Once that is done, it works like a charm. The power boost even helps, so I'm quite please with the product. I wish it balanced a bit better and didn't take up so much space, but the signal quality and power boost make up for these deficiencies."
5,hd tv,"I bought this Turk antenna on the recommendation of my neighbor. Although it is small it works great. i got four more channels that i did not even know existed, It works much better then the 10 foot long one i was using. I have recommended it to several friends that bought it and they got the same or better results."
3,A bit picky on direction,"Bought this to pick up over the air HD. The picture and audio is great as long as it's aimed the right way. It is a little touchy on the direction it is pointed. I could get most of the channels in my area aimed one direction, but needed to turn it to pick up others. I was never able to get all of the local channels using one position. Tried adjusting the fins but that only seemed to make it worse. Ended up picking up a used aerial antenna and mounting it in the rafters of the garage. That is working much better. When this antenna was ""tuned in"" to a signal it was great. I was able to get HD channels from over 50 miles away that I can't get with the aerial antenna. Just was too much of a hassle to turn it whenever I wanted to change channels. If you have most of your TV signals coming from the same direction, this would probably work for you. I just needed wider angle antenna for my area."
2,Horrible,I can only get 3 channels to work properly.I either don't get reception for other channels or the signal is choppy at best.Waste of money.
1,bad reception,"bought this item for new big screen to improve reception, no better than the much cheaper item that it replaced"
3,Terk Indoor antenna,I tried this antenna and didn't get any better reception than my old rabbit ears.
2,Didn't work well for me,"I was unable to get any, save one, clear channel in regardless of how I positioned the antenna."
4,Good Reception Bad Transmitting,The packaged arrived and I assembled the antenna and hooked it up and it work real well the only problem was the stations transmitting towers either do not beam this way or I'm blocked by buildings. he channels I get are clearer than before and sound better now I just have to find a better placement for reception.Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Reception
1,Did not work,"This may work for some, but for those in rural/mountain areas I would not bother. It is quite flimsy when it stands and looks cheap in your living room. This product did not work for me at all. It also cost me about $23.00 between shipping and restocking fees. Check your third party seller's policy before you try. I could of just bought it from my local Radio Shack and saved the shipping & restocking cost..duh."
1,Heart of the bay area - just 3 unknown channels?,"I live in the heart of the bay area and after seeing 482 reviews here, I want to give a try. I am sorry to let you know that this antenna was receiving terrible signals - just 3 channels that too I haven't heard the name of these channels. I don't want this. I initially set it up in the living area closer to the patio door - awful reception. Then tried out in the patio, reception was good for just 3 channels I just mentioned. In the package, it says ""before you choose to return give a call to our CS experts"". I dialed the 1800 number and the person was so cool. He told, ""Sorry for the trouble Sir, Infact you need HDTVo antenna and not this one. Haha what a joke. All the positive reviews are just fake? Anyways, returned back. I don't think I will ever try another Terk antenna - go for comcast, as they have good offers or probably direct TV which gives upto 7000 thankyou points."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money!!!,Worked no better than my cheap non-amplified antenna that cost me about ten bucks.Although I bought it through Amazon it came from Onecall and of course not only do you lose shipping costs they charge a 15% re-stocking fee.I recommend looking elswhere.By the way there really is no such thing as a high definition antenna.
2,Didn't pick up many stations.,"However, this may be caused by location within a 'bunker' :-)a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r"
5,Antenna did not deliver the channel I need,"This antenna did not deliver the channel I needed so I would not recommend buying this item. Even though this channel is blocked by buildings, this antenna states in the box that it cannot deliver that type of channel but the ad for it says it can."
2,5 channels,"I got 5 channels and 1 of them was the Spanish channels... I dont know about you, but I can't speak spanish, so I really got 4 channels ... more incentive to not watch TV ... I guess"
1,Dissatisfied with Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified Antenna,I am dissatified with the Terk HDTV Amplified High-Definition Antenna. I have returned the Antenna and I heard of no response.
3,Go with an outside Antana,I would sugjest if you can just use an outside antana if you want Only an inside one for some reason this one is Perfict for you. I rated it a 3 star cuz everyone rated it so high made me think it would be the best antana I could posable get for an HD antana and it is not. I would say for an indoor antana It probably is
3,Worked fine for some channels.,This is an awesome piece for the price but I couldn't get the signal at my home really well. Some of the channels that got the reception worked really well but others channels played and stuck very often.
4,Great Antenna,"Its a great antenna, but don't expect it to work any miracles. If you know enough that you've been bouncing around the idea of a rooftop antenna, you'd be best following that path. Still though, great antenna, worked better than the other set top ones I've tried."
1,Reception?,"Would have given the product a ZERO (0) star rating, but one (1) was the lowest available. Hard if not next to impossible- (have been trying every combination conceivable for two hours now) to try to find the correct direction. Their site's locational assistance which was finally found under their OUTDOOR antennas was of little value and not at all user friendly! Got the most channels (not the ones I wanted) by laying it on it's BACK AND POINTING IT AT THE CEILING! I am unable to get more than 2 of my 8 local HDTV channels which I currently get through cable, which totally negates my reason for purchasing the antenna since I wanted to eliminate cable. Wish I could return it!"
2,DISAPOINTED,I SHURE WAS DISAPOINTED WITH THE TERK HDTV ANTENNA. IT WOULD ONLY PICKUP A FEW CHANNELS.IN FACT I'M GOING TO SELL IT
1,IT DIDN'T WORK,"Sorry to say I bought this indoor antenna due to the changeover to digital TV. But as all indoor antennas, it did not work at all, and I returned it to Amazon....they took it back without a problem."
1,Junk,"Terk Technology HDTVi VHF/UHF HDTV Indoor AntennaI can't remember the last time that I made such a poor purchase descision. Fortunately it doesn't happen that often or I probably wouldn't have some of the really neat things that I have and I would be going around ticked off all the time. Hopefully I'll make better choices next time. Actually I've been doing pretty well up until this piece of trash. Unfortunately Consumers Reports doesn't review indoor or as far as I know outdoor antenna's. Too busy reviewing Masserati's or Bently's I suppose. Considering I live fairly close to San Francisco where all the transmitting towers are, the reception should have been a lot better. As it stands I find I get as good reception if just hook up a coax cable to the TV and don't attach the other end to anything. Pretty sad wouldn't you say. P.J."
2,Terk HDTVa,"I have a 42"" LCD 1080p HDTV, been using the Philips amplified antenna that do up to 45db... Tried the Terk yesterday it didn't do a good job of getting the channels, with the ones it got picture wasn't that good, keep in mind Terk does say on the box up to 1080i not 1080p resolution, big difference in the two. the 1080i is the old resolution that sends each frame in two two parts where the 1080p sends it in one, so I went back to my Philips antenna that I've been using for the last 2 years."
5,Great Antenna!,"I researched antennas alot before purchasing the Terk. It is amazing, i have it connected to my 37"" vizion in a room that has no cable and it pulls through atleast 40 channels. I live in philly so it gets the important--3,6,10,17,29,57,69 and many more. For the price and ease of use i could not be happier."
5,Terk HDTVa worked for me.,I was very skeptical about reception quality but this antenna has changed my mind. I can't believe the signal quality and I am so happy I bought it. I do recommend after your TV searches for channels let is sit for a while after they are set up and clear. Then have your TV search again. I was pleasantly surprised that it picked up all the regular channels on the second try. I live on the second story of a three story building and every once in a while interference cuts out the signal but it either comes right back up or I sometimes have to adjust it slightly. Overall I am impressed. I have a 720p TV and I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity of the picture. If you want to let go of your cable company like I did this was a great alternative.
3,Not any better than the $10 antenna I bought,"I was hoping to pick up the CBS station which is approx 30 miles away from be by pointing this antenna directly at its location. I used [...] to point it correctly but the signal is still weak and goes out. I get the same signal using a $10 antenna I bought from Walmart. Another problem is the base stability. Its fine until you pull out the rabbit ears all the way. Once they are pulled out all the way it is very easy for the antenna to tip over. I was also disappointed in the appearance. I was hoping to have something that didn't look ridiculous in my living room. It was only 35bucks so Im not going to bother with returning it, but I am disappointed in the results."
4,Great replacement of old rabbit ears,I am roughly 40+miles from the towers and this works great. It does require the right aiming but little to no adustments once set up. I am pleased to replace my old phillips antenna that I had to constantly move and mess with the gain. I recommend to anyone trying to either get better reception or cut their cable bill. I have this and netflix and I am not looking back at paying $$$ for two or three channels on cable I watched.
4,great reception but bulky,"Like title says it gets great reception but bulky and requires a lot of space to aim it. Plus the low channels require the rabbit ears. These required lots of fine tuning. But once pointed in right direction and rabbit ears set I get all my local channels. No more adjusting from channel to channel, though your mileage may very depending on location of towers."
2,"Crummy design, poorly made. Disappointed.","Antennae piece snapped off in my hand first time I tried to extend it so I really have to question the workmanship. Cord runs through bottom of stand and makes the whole thing tip over VERY easily (which it did repeatedly even though we kept pushing the cord into the channel). Cord to plug it in is way too short in my opinion. Our tv is mounted above our fireplace and everything else we have reaches the outlet, this didn't. Reception was so-so. Channels we got were very clear but there are other channels received by other tv's in the house that this didn't pick up. I was pretty disappointed given the reviews, I definitely expected better."
3,HDRVa Review,"The product, at best, gives a mediocre return for the money. The signal strength for high definition is a bit stronger than when I had an analog antenna on it. I expected a stronger signal that would be stable. At times, however, the strength seems to weaken. I don't know if it's the weather conditions or not since it is being used indoors."
2,Less than expected,The reception with this unit was less than expected. Standard RCA unit with the dial feature was much better.
5,Very good for HD signals.,"I bought it for the second tv in my house and it works much better than my other antenna, a Winegard SS-3000. I would recommend Terk, great reception capability and also easier to install."
3,"Worked, but not as well as Old Zenith","I ordered this thinking that the Terk's extra elements and amplification system might give me more channels and better reception. However, the amplification did not seem to make any difference on or off. Neither did the extra antenna elements. My older, simpler and non-amplified Zenith antenna (don't believe it is still in production)of somewhat similar design gave the best reception. To be fair, I think that it is difficult to know what any antenna will do given differences in circumstances such as distance from broadcast antenna, obstacles, etc. These factors obviously do determine much of your reception. This Terk system may (as indicated by many other reviews)provide great functionality. My advice is to try out a returnable antenna system to see if it works in your location on a consistent basis."
2,poor reception,"Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Reception .... poor reception, only receive 3 digital channels and 3 analog channels."
2,A Placebo!,"I tried using this antenna different ways on my computer, since it picks up tv stations. The only channel that came in clear was channel 50 for DC. I tried digital HD and analog. I decided to keep it and attach it to my Bose radio for reception. It looks nice, but does not work!Also, I hate using those screw on cords, as opposed to the ones you just push on. It took me a while to attach to my computer since the whole is underneath the side that sticks out over it. I have found out again that you cannot go by other people's reviews."
1,"""High tech"" rabbit ears.","Looks silly - ""Flash Gordon"" deco. Big & ungainly. But that wouldn't be so awful if it worked better than a $1. pair of ""rabbit ears"" from a Dollor Store. IT DOES NOT!The ""amplification"" makes no improvement what-so-ever. I'm 8 miles from The Empire State Building where this areas signals originate - One can almost see it from my top floor window (I'm that close) - BUT you still have to fiddle with this piece of junk almost every time a channel is changed.SAVE YOUR MONEY - This is ""The Emporors New-Clothes"" of antennas!"
1,Not all that it seems to be,"For those of us that don't want to pay for cable and the only choice we have is rabbit ears. This HDTV antenna is not all that it cracked up to be.It does not do well in bringing in the signal. Many stations still come in with broken up images. Even if your play with the antenna moving it, it still does not help.I do not live in a rural area or have tall buildings around me. I actually have a clear line to the transmitters on the mountain. I live in the Los Angeles area with many telvision stations.I honest feel that for some of you this antenna is not for you. I wish I have the answer as to what antenna is best for you and not put out your money to find which one is best for you.I now have that problem also. Maybe an outdoor one?"
1,No better reception than a simple pair of rabbit ears,I got a digital converter box with my television. There are several channels that I only get intermittently with digital TV. So I bought this hoping it would boost the reception more than an old pair of rabbit ear antenna.The product didn't increase the reception at all. I sent it back.
1,A piece of Junk,"This is a crap, does not work in Brookyn (Bensonhurst) at all. Has poor signal in Elmhurst Queen where Phillips has no problem at all. Don't buy this."
3,Terk antenna,"This hasn't lived up to my expectations. However, I'm not sure if *my* set up has a HD tuner (I've got to check the manual). I'm in an area that does not get cable and this antenna works OK, just not great. I've learned that mast antennas nowadays are already HD compliant so I'll probably go back to using that as it gets better reception on some channels this indoor one can't get due to signal strength & direction.BTW, the cable that comes with it is too short for big screen TVs."
1,Never received any signal,"Not only did the antenna not work with either hd receiver within 17 miles of any transmitter, terk.com is nonoperational. Basically I feel like this is the online version of a fly by night operation. Total ripoff and I'm left holding the piece of crap made in China."
3,didn't pull in the channels,"Bought it because of some good reviews and the look.However, it didn't work as well as the $15 rabbit ears (jensen) and definitely not as well as the amplified rabbit ears. I ended up with the $50 flat panel RCA because it had the best reception for me."
3,"ok, but bad design","While indeed I found better HD reception with this antenna vs. the HD cable box, the design is so ridiculous as to make it unable.the base is small while the aerials stand out and the main triangle is difficult to fit in anywhere near your flat screen tv.So - 2 things happen.1. design flaw, it falls over ALL the time. with the antanne cord underneath it make it even worse. Do the design engineers actually talk to the physics engineers?2. where to you put it? it's the most ridiculous thing sticking out of the back of your entertainment unit or anywhere in the living room.Probably fine for a remote cottage, in the city, go external.It does work, but the practicalities lower its actual effectiveness and use. You need to be near a window.If its in the middle of the room, you will greatly lose reception and the number of channels you get."
4,Great Antenna wish I purchased it sooner..,"For starters, the Terk HDTVa is the amplified version of the Terk HDTVi. Let me make this short and brief, not all antennas (I realize antenna is already in the plural form but it just doesn't sound right) are created equal.Although I'm not far from our local towers (about 12 miles) the line of view is covered with trees and buildings. I was previously using a RCA amplified indoor antenna given to me by a coworker who opted for a Channel Master 4228 outdoor antenna because he was 50 miles from the tower. The RCA gave me all the channels from my local tower but with very weak signal strength. The difference with this Terk is night and day. I no longer have to get up to adjust the antenna when watching my favorite shows."
1,Did not work for me AT ALL! Please read!,"I got the Terk, the Leaf, regular old rabbit ears, and the Philips SDV6122. The Philips runs circles around the others. The Terk did not work at all- I did not get even one channel tuned with it, and I returned it. The Leaf (non-amplified version which costs more than the Philips) works somewhat, better than the old rabbit ears, but you have to literally tape it to the window to get any uninterrupted channels. The Philips was able to find 13 channels in my kitchen, which is in the middle of the house; the Leaf did not pick up one channel there. In the bedroom, the Philips picked up 27 channels, and it is not near a window. I am using the Leaf for my stereo now to pick up better FM channels, and am buying two more of the Philips! Hands down, the Philips is the best antenna of the four options I've tried. You should strongly consider getting the Philips instead of this one."
4,This product works well enough,I live in SF and in direct line of sight with TV tower about 3 miles away. I got the signals very clear. The instruction to assemble the unit was clear and easy to follow. Highly recommended.
5,The cost worths it.,"Great product!! Excellent pictures and a lot of channels. After I installed this antenna, I got like more than 30 channels from channel 2 to channel 55. This is a great product. Although the price is bit of high, the quality is awesome. I actually bought the second one for my another TV."
4,I'm a Believer,"I was frankly skeptical that this antenna could do the job, especially considering the distance our house is from the broadcasting antenna (about 20 miles) and considering we live in a city with no clear line of site to the TV broadcasting tower, but I'm now a believer of this antenna after following the set-up instructions.Unlike analog signal, digital either gives you a picture or doesn't. If the antenna isn't oriented properly, sometimes the picture will pixelate or stutter, but with some patience and a receiver with a signal indicator, you can pretty much tweak the thing to give you maximum signal strength.The picture is fantastic and in fact, better than conventional cable or satelite by a mile! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this device to anyone considering in buying an HDTV or HD cable service. You must, however, follow the instructions carefully and use their on-line tool to find proper orientation for the antenna."
2,Signal is worse than using cable line as antenna,"I was using my existing cable line as my antenna (which runs outside my house and up to the 2nd story) for a while which worked OK most of the time. However, I decided to try an antenna to boost reception after my local NBC station started flaking out in poor weather. I bought this antenna based on the positive reviews and I am less than impressed. I could never reliably get all my local stations at once even though they are coming from basically the same direction (and in the same city in which I live). I'd skip it and go straight to an attic antenna if I had to do it again. This is already back in the mail for a return."
4,Terk HDTV Antenna,My computer person is helping me understand this new antenna. It's very goodand I don't have to bother the Cable Company with the new TV I have put inmy studio at the back of the garden.
3,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified Antenna,"This antenna is very good looking, but I returned it because even though it is an amplified antenna it gave me the same reception as my rabbit ears antenna."
1,Poor antenna,"Maybe it's just where you live, but I've tried this thing in two different houses I've lived in and they were both terrible. Plus this thing is huge when you extend the onboard rabbit ears. Extremely unattractive so unless you have a closet to hide it in, go with something else. I bought a Philips antenna (Philips SDV2740/27 HDTV/UHF/VHF/FM Digital Indoor TV Antenna) at Wal-Mart for like $30 and it works way better than this thing AND it's tiny and attractive too! Don't waste your time on this junk."
3,Alright for the money,"For the rave reviews people are giving this thing, its alright. Everyone says they are out in the middle of nowhere and get a bazzillion channels. Well, I dont live in the middle of nowhere, I live between to major cities, yet I only get 6 digital channels and 2 HD channels. Sure I get a bunch of fuzzy looking oldschool channels that I could care less about and I'm not going to waste the time screwing around with bunny ears. This is a mid-range product. I'm sure there is something better out there. If you find it, let me know ;)"
2,Did not live up to other reviewers ratings,"I bought this last month after I discontinued my cable service. I was picking up about 25 stations with my old unamplified ordinnary analog indoor tv antenna. After I hooked up the Terk, I gained 4 more stations all in channels above 13 and foreign language which I do not watch. However for the lower channels, it performed the same as my old rabbit ears. The signals on channels 2 and 4 still breaks up in bad weather and greatly annoyed me during important moments in the winter olympic viewing last month.For all that money compared to unamplified antennas, it was a great disappointment."
4,So far found to be a good product and working,"Terk HDTV a Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV what I purchased on March 4, 2009 via Amazon.com Reception found so far shows good result and active with good picture and receiption of audio. I made a good decision to go for this product and I am satisfied with it as of to-day April 4, 2009."
2,indoor digital antenna,"After installing, this antenna would not stay upright & did not give any reception on my local stations. The cable was to short to locate a spot in this room to give me decent reception."
4,Beautiful Picture Quality,"It was easy to put together and I get a great picture. I have it attached to a 19"" hd lcd tv in my kicthen. picture is clear and sharp. I am very pleased."
4,"Works, but not much better than an unpowered version",I have a comparable (same antenna shape/design) that is unpowered. I get good reception on both; there is not much difference. This one also has a VHF antenna so might be more useful than a straight UHF if you want to receive NTSC as well as ATSC channels.
3,Not the best,"Supposedly this was supposed to be the best antenna on the market for HDTV, but i could only get one channel. I purshased the dish looking antenna from radioshack and it picked up everything. I guess its like any antenna as they all work different per your area. The construction of this antenna is first class, I do have to say."
2,Disappointing,"I was encouraged by all the good reviews, however, it turned out to be no better than the old 4 fin style antennae. Several stations have weak signals and kept freezing up or going out altogether. So I hooked up the terk and... NO SIGNAL said the screen. I hooked up the old one and got the station to come in. The amplifier was plugged in and it did boost the signal as I tested it on the stronger stations. But in the end the old one did just as good and even better on some stations. I guess a big one on the roof is needed or maybe I can talk my mom and sister to finally get a dish so I can have something to watch when I go visit!!"
2,Poor Reception,The antennaTerk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Receptiongave very poor reception in all parts of my house on the first (just snow) and second floors (barely discernable picture). I could not try the attic because of no connections. This antenna is apparently very sensitive to location and has limited application.
4,Free HDTV!,"I recently bought a 40"" LCD TV and had heard you can get free HD reception using just an antenna. After a little bit of research I decided to give it a try as the only risk was the price of the antenna. Sure enough, it works great with crystal clear HD pictures and sound. I get 39 channels overall, 10 of which are HD. I tested it with the antenna sitting on a coffee table next to the TV. I live about 25 miles from the broadcast tower (see antennaweb.org).I gave the VHF 'dipoles' a quick try but they are 3.5 feet wide and not practical use.I'm now planning to drop my satellite service (yee haa!). I can get to Netflix & Windows Media Center thru Xbox. I just need to figure out how to hook up a bedroom TV to all this."
1,Was great...for 2 months,"Brought us 4 channels, just enough, for exactly 2 months. Then it stopped working completely. No channels. Haven't had any since. We keep trying occasionally but to no avail, and there really aren't any switches or buttons to troubleshoot with except for on/off. This was a real disappointment- wish we hadn't wasted our money."
3,Works right out of the box-simple install,After receiving this product I had it hooked up in a couple of minutes. Everything was there to make installation as easy as 123. The only thing I am not thrilled with is the signal strength of the UHF band.It won't pull in UHF signals from as close as twenty-five miles without pixelation but is still acceptable. All in all I am glad I bought it.
5,Trek HDTV,Antenna worked very well. The amplification made a huge difference in the quality of the reception.
4,It works good for me,"Before purchasing an antenna I read several reviews on Amazon for a few different antennas. Considering price ($36) and performance I chose this antenna. This antenna is better than the standard ""rabbit ears"" antenna that I had before. With my old antenna I was not able to get FOX or ABC along with some UHF channels. With this antenna I am now able to get those stations along with some other UHF channels. It's not perfect as I do have to make adjustments if I want to get certain UHF channels, but it does receive the most popular UHF and VHF stations fairly well. As far as setting it up goes...I was able to set it up and connect it in less than 5 minutes without reading the directions so it is fairly easy. I did have to re-scan my TV channels after connecting it though. I also priced this antenna at other places on the web and it was cheapest at Amazon. If you're looking for a low cost, good working antenna then this should do the job for you."
1,total failure,This product managed to bring in two stations in a location without impediments in a major metropolitan area. Design is terrible - cord comes out of bottom and it kept falling over. Plug overheated in socket so that it was HOT to the touch. It felt dangerous as both a fire and electrical hazard in that the product could not stand up on its own because of the cord. Terrible design.
3,mixed feeling,"I set this antenna in my parent house in Downey,CA,and picked up approx 40 channels,So I bought another antenna and set this one in my aparment in Costa Mesa,CA,but only picked up 3 channels with weak signal(all spanish channels)..."
3,"Decent reception, but don't try to put it in your attic!","I bought this antenna to connect to my home theater PC [...]. My hope was that I could hide it away in the attic and just run coax down to my HTPC. This worked well during the colder winter months, but once it started getting warmer, the signal quality dropped off significantly. I ended up making my own antenna out of coat hangers, which has been working fine so far."
1,Terk HDTVa - very unsatisfactory!,"I got a DTV converter box and attached my rabbit ear antenna. The signal kept breaking down at times, so I bought Terk HDTVa with an amplifier for better reception, after reading about it on the net.To my surprise, it picked up just a couple of channels! Moving it all over the room did not help. The amplifier was not part of the antenna, but an external one, only with a vey difficult to operate on-off switch, which did not show any difference at all. Today it is gooing to get put next to the street to be picked up along by the garbage!Shame on you Amazon."
3,Reception not as good as advertised,"I purchased this antenna in hope of getting my local stations less than 20 miles radius. Unfortunately it didnt do any better than my first purchase of a $10 antenna. The unit reception is unstable even with the amp. The base stand very uneven even if the coax cable is inserted correctly. Don't bother with this antenna is you live in an area that has reception problem to begin with. Get an old fashioned roof antenna, its works like a charm."
4,This antenna plus Netflix minus cable equals $100.00 per month.,Still have trouble with some stations when it's windy but this is the fourth antenna I've tried and it's by far the best in reception. I added another power boost/amplifier which helps. Very satisfied. Would recommend it to anyone looking to pull channels in from 20-30 miles. Some of the channels higher up on the band only receive sound but the channel scan feature of my TV gives me at least 15 crystal clear terrific HD channels.
1,No better than a cheap RadioShack antenna,"I bought a generic antenna from RadioShack. It was ok but picked up disturbances. I saw this Terk later and ordered it hoping to replace the RadioShack one. Come to find out, it's just as bad. Also, it's really bulky. In this day and age where everything is sleek and small, this thing stands out like a dinosaur."
4,More than worth the money.,"After doing a good deal of research on indoor amplified antennas, I decided to give this one a try. I was not disappointed. Not only do I get clean, crisp reception, I now receive several more channels that I wasn't able to get with traditional bunny ears. My only complaint is the unstable base. The base is much narrower than it should be, allowing the unit to easily tip over. This problem was easily solved with some double sided tape and a cardboard cake round."
1,"Looks great, Not great","Wanted to replace a cheap $20 Phillips antenna that I bought at walmart. Bought this after hearing it was a great antenna. It is not a great antenna. After one week of trying every angle and direction the cheap antenna with a 50db booster out performed this antenna hands down. The cheap antenna got all but one of the channel at a time. This antenna all I could get was three or four at a time. Took three or four positions to achieve all the channels that the cheaper one got with two positions. Too unidirectional, which might be ok if all the towers are in one direction. Elswise look elswere."
3,Works... But Poor build quality...,"Make sure that switch is put completly in the ""on"" position before reviewing. I live ~25 miles from antenna in NYC. Receive major network channels (cbs, nbc, abc) however, everytime you change channel, need to make adjustments to receive a signal for almost all major network channels. Finally, antenna ""ears"" are very weak. (cheap alloy) Accidently bumped into antenna and the ""ear"" snapped. Now the other ""ear"" is bent. Be extra careful with this item."
2,Don't bother...go with an outdoor antenna,"Didn't have any luck with the indoor antenna despite only living 8-9 mi's from where the stations are transmitted. However, as soon as I stuck the indoor antenna out the upstairs window i picked a solid 20 digital stations with strong signal levels. So I then went with an outdoor antenna from radioshack (model 15-2187 - $80), spent a day mounting it and running cable, and it works great.I think my problem was mostly because my house is solid brick and RF signals can't get through. However, I would recommend just starting with an outdoor model versus buying an indoor antenna and then, when that doesn't work, an outdoor model. It's well worth the effort."
4,Flimsy item but it works great,"the unit worked great but when i push in the antenna to move it, the end piece snapped off. Disappointed but it still works fine."
4,Works Great!,"I had previously tried going the cheaper route with a HDTV antenna, but it ended up with poor picture quality that would stutter and skip every couple of seconds, resulting in an extremely poor TV experience. After fiddling with the position for a few days with no improvement, I decided to get this antenna to replace it.As soon as I hooked it up I could definitely tell the difference over my old antenna! The clarity was much better and the stuttering had stopped on all channels except for the most obscure and weakest TV stations in my area. If you are in the market for a HDTV antenna I would highly recommend this one, its fantastic!"
1,Not worth the money,"In the NY area, it only picked up 16 channels, even with the rabbit ears fully extended.Bulky, takes up a lot of space, for only 16 channels, I don't think it's worth it."
5,Probably the best indoor antenna,"I have built several broadcast television stations, and am always looking for good options for over the air reception. I have tested many in door antennas in the last few years. although I've not found anything particularly good for VHF reception this antenna is OK, but for UHF it's great. I'm not impressed with most antenna amplifiers, but the amp built into this antenna is exceptional!"
1,FAIL,"I was surprised to find that the Terk HDTVa performs much worse than the cheapest set of RCA bunny ears.This antenna might work in some locations, but my recommendation is to avoid the headaches and pass.The Terk gets 2 stars for ease of setup because it's natural resting position is on its side. The base is poorly designed and it just wants to tip over.This product is going back to Expo."
1,Just a piece of plastic - Don't buy,"I just moved to a new location where the tv reception over the air was very bad. Before I was getting 50+ channels through my $10 RCA antenna connected to my DTV box.When I moved to new apartment only few (around 20 channels) were coming.I thought I should buy a DTV antenna instead. After reading positive reviews I bought this piece of junk for $30+.This is just a piece of crap plastic assembled together to look like a high-tech device.This antenna gives me no more than 10 channels, and the built-in signal booster does no help.I switched back to my old $10 regular RCA antenna that I bought a long time ago from Walmart.The other bad thing about this antenna is that it is too heavy for its own base.You just can't make it stand still for a long time. It fells down due to its own weight and the connected cable.I would never buy anything from TERK again."
3,its just ok,better than the rca one we had earlier..but we need to keep it outside on the patio to get good signals. But once we do that we have over 30 channels !
4,Terk amplified HD indoor TV antenna,Product shipped quickly and has performed well after easy installation. Would recommend it to others.
1,worse than my old broken rabbit ears,"This antenna, which i selected because of the customer reviews(!), is junk. it gets fewer channels than my old broken rabbit ears were managing, and it falls over constantly. not recommended."
2,Not Impressed,"It looks very cool, but was very sensitive to orientation. Since there are not many free channels out there, it was pretty disappointing to move it for different channels. Turned out that it was broken. Found a set of old school rabbit ears and they seem to work better, since one position works well and I did not have to find the channels. I am not getting the replacement option. I would recommend trying the latest conventional antenna before spending the extra money for HD features. Since it's all digital, either should work for HD."
2,Not ideal for heavily wooded areas!,"I purchased this product after much research into options for reception in areas surrounded with tall timber. I was disappointed that this antenna captured only two of the sixteen signals indentified on the FCC DTV map for my area. The most distant transmitter tower was only 19 miles from my home, yet only one signal was viewable. I will say that the picture was immaculate for that one station. However, I am returning this antenna and will renew my search for a more suitable method of off-air reception in my wooded wilderness."
5,Excellent product,It is an excellent and high quality product. Just needed to follow the TV setup manual to make it function.
3,Can say it works but quite bigger than expected,The antenna worked and I was able to receive crystal clear HD channels. I couldn't get it work for all the channels. The digital ones worked but analog ones did not work out. The antenna is quite big and the socket to plug in TV is very tricky. took me good amount of time... before I was about to give up! Challange is there is no alternative. I am returning this as it did not meet my expectations on size and number of channels (may be its my area)
3,"Disappointed,","I realize that this is probably a great antenna (for those living around really strong TV signals). I live about 30 miles from one tower and about 50 from another. This pulled in I think no stations in my living room, and 3 when I put it in the attic. To make a long story short, after many antennas, I bought an outdoor Antennacraft from RadioShack (the $70) and that pulls in all 21 channels in my area, including the Low-VHF PBS on channel 3. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend unless you live in a metropolitan area I suppose. For me it was a waste of money."
3,Terk Indoor Aplified Antenna,"Had purchased one and it worked so well in getting PPS channels on my tv upstairs I purchased this one for the tv downstairs. Unfortunately, it get LESS channels than the old time rabbit ears I have been using so had to put the old antenna back on and will call Trek's techs to see if they can advise me how to obtain more channels especially the PPS ones on this television. Otherwise the purchase was worthless..."
1,Poor Performance in Both Urban and Rural Setting,"I bought this with hopes of getting basic HD stations (NBC, CBS, ABC and PBS) and despite trying it in both an urban area just outside of DC and a little bit out in the country, and in neither situation have I been able to get good reception. It's size and visual eyesore is not worth the one or two stations you may get, an even then they are subject to pixelation."
1,if you live in a town or city don't get this one.,I live in the middle of town. there are two major stations less than twenty miles away. this thing cannot find them or anything else that isn't univision.i got a cheapy somewhere else. it works.
2,didn't pick up anything,"didn't pick up any station, but that was probably because we are in a valley. So, I cannot tell how the product would work under normal circumstances"
1,easily broken,"I was excited after reading all the good reviews on this product. Though the actual reception when the unit was in a good spot, was brilliant, you are still limited due to the type of construction you live in and the buildings around you and the clouds on that particular day. What was very poor about this product is how the cord that connects to the TV unit runs through the base of the Terk. There isn't a manner of securing it safely in place. This allows for the thick cord to wriggle out and tip. The antenna is a not a replaceable part of this unit and it breaks easily."
2,Terk,The antennae works reasonably but not spectacular compared to the other units I tested. If you can get it to stay standing. Double sided tape does not do it . . .
2,Don't waste your money,"I looked at many different types of antennas and bought this because of its online popularity. The first problem is that it's top heavy and tips over easily. The cord has a narrow opening underneath, but when it tips over the cord comes out too easily. If I were to build this I would make the base more stable and have the cord just go out the back side.The second problem was that our HDTV reception isn't good. I am not sure if the amplifier works because there isn't an on/off led light built in. How am I supposed to know if the amplifier is working correctly Terk?The last problem is that our reception isn't very good and we only live 8 miles from the broadcast tower. I was hoping for better reception but didn't get it with this product. Don't buy it!!!"
1,JUNK!,Replaced a $10 set of old rabbit ears with this Terk antenna thinking that it would do better because it was expensive. I thought wrong as this thing actually gets fewer channels that my rabbit ears. Don't waste your money on this antenna! It does not do any better than the cheapo rabbit ears you can get for MUCH less.
1,Terrible reception and very unreliable in SoCal,I was only able to get handful of channels and most them had very choppy reception. The reception varies with the time of day. I don't think you can rely on this antenna.
1,poor reception,I purchased this due to the statement of reception. It did not work I also bought the Terk V5 which works.
4,Good overall antenna,I made an antenna with coat hangers and I was getting bad reception. With this antenna the reception is stable and a lot better.
2,Nothing special,"I stuck a piece of wire in the antenna jack while waiting for this antenna to arrive. Just hung it along a window. I was able to get 2 HDTV stations that way and was really thinking it could only get better with an amplified antenna. No luck, the reception is the same as my 8 foot long piece of wire."
1,Antenna???,"This antenna doesn't work, I send 2 back. Dont' buy it waste of time and money. It looks good but can't perform, if you are look to get an HD antennaget this one ""Antennas Direct DB2 Multi Directional HDTV Antenna"" nothing fancy works great."
1,Didn't work at all,"I try to make my reviews fair and honest but I can find nothing good to say about the Terk HDTVa antenna. I visit a lot of BB stores as part of work and I was curious why nearly every store has this product in the customer return area. Their selling price is almost 70 but I saw one the same price as the everyday price here and bought it. I plugged it in to my TV (I am line of sight to the transmitter towers) and I could not receive even one HDTV station. Zero. Now, it could be that is why the first customer or customers returned it. But it is hard to believe something so simple could not even pick up one station. The product is ridiculously overpriced at 70, it really is nothing more that a cheap pair of rabbit ears. I honestly don't think its worth 39 even if it worked. If I get another and I can make it work I'll update this review."
1,Did not work with my TV,"The antenna arrived in great condition and when promised, however, it did not work any better than a much cheaper antenna I have been using. The reception was intermittant at best."
2,terk or turkey?,"The Terk HDTVa antenna seems an adaquate reception device for an indoor antenna recieving over the air digital signals. While it boasts of an amplication of signals, I found that to be an underwhelming feature. Granted my area has very poor reception, which is why I choose this particular antenna to begin with, but it did little to improve the digital signal to my older model TV. A strange facet of the Antenna was that the connection to the TV didnt seem to screw on at all. I had to tape it in place. Lastly it needs to be plugged into an outlet which takes up space and uses electricity. You also need to press the little switch for the amplication feature which is very small. Over all I think you can get the same reception over the air with an antenna that costs less than the 40 dollars I paid."
2,Terk Antenna,"This antenna is a science fiction looking version of rabbit ears. The high tech design and the electrical boost from the plug in wire do nothing to increase reception beyond the signal from the low tech rabbit ears (for under $10) it replaced. The UHF antenna is the ""futuristic"" looking part and the VHF antenna is still old fashioned rabbit ears, though a little thicker than the one that came with your analog TV. The antenna works better than no antenna, so I gave it two stars."
1,"worked for 2 months, then went turned useless.","I bought this in late January. It worked great for all of 2 months; all of the available channels came in clear. Then all of the sudden, I couldn't get half of the channels I could before; I constantly have to tweak it to pick up a show and even then the pick up is choppy and totally ANNOYING. I am looking to get a refund or an exchange as perhaps mine was defective. My TERK antenna is barely more than a piece of modern art at the moment."
1,too much interference and choppy signal,"I got this one based on the good reviews. But this is is a big disappoint. It has too much interferences and the signal is very choppy if people walks around the room. I have to buy an RCA from walmart to replace it, and the RCA works very well, as described in one of the most helpful review. I got all the channels like ABC/NBC/CBS/PBS/FOX and several other local channels. Now I do not need to be irritated by the choppy signal with the Terk antenna."
1,Garbage-- buy the Leaf HDTV Antenna instead,"This antenna did not work at all; we could not get a single clean channel. In addition, it was both highly directional and actually quite huge, plus prone to falling over due to the ridiculously tiny base. I've seldom used such a poorly designed product. Purchasing it was purely a waste of time, though many thanks go to Amazon for their painless return process.TheLeaf indoor HDTV antennais much better. It's MUCH more sensitive (we get 20+ channels with ease now) and it's so tiny you can tape it to a wall or window. I highly recommend the Leaf antenna plus amplifier over the Terk antenna. (I see that there is an amplified version of the Leaf antenna available, but we bought a separate amplifier.)"
3,50/50,"The antenna arrived quickly and in good condition; great seller. However, the products down falls are its bulky and I get choppy signals. I expected the reception to be better considering the size of the thing. This is my first time using this type of antenna on my HDTV though. I am used to having cable."
3,Better than the flat RCA antenna,"I tried this based on a lot of good reviews. It does work somewhat better than the flat RCA antenna I tried first, but still isn't great. I did see from the instructions that stucco siding can have an adverse effect on reception, but even placing it near a window didnt really help. I put an extension cable on it to move it where it would be less visible and it decreased the reception pretty drastically.Nothing seems to get anywhere near the reception of the good old rooftop antenna for TV or FM - but since I live in a townhouse that's no longer an option."
4,A lot better than rabbit ears - but not perfect,"It set up easily. It requires AC power. It gets me most of the channels, when plain rabbit ears gave me none. The direction it's pointed means everything, and sometimes the stations drop out. I think I live in a difficult reception area. I'm about 20 miles from downtown, but there's a hillside between my home and the transmission towers."
2,Picked up only 1 channel with poor quality,"This product did not work in my apartment. I live on the 6th floor in Arlington, VA near Ronald Reagan Airport. Bought this product because of high rating but dissapointed with the poor performance."
1,Not that good,"Bought this for my parents that live in the country. Could only get the same shows that they got with another ""rabbit ear"" antenna. For us, a waste of money. Plan to try it at a different location to see if it works any better."
5,Less than 5 minutes to set-up,"I ordered this antenna based on the reviews I saw on Amazon. I live in an area with not a lot of tall structures so maybe that contributed to the ease of set-up. I took it out of the box, plugged in the adapter and plugged it into my TV. Scanned for channels and voila! It worked like a charm. I did not even have to read the instructions. It is a sturdy product with a nice, somewhat futuristic look."
2,"My old, broken rabbit ears get many more channels with much better picture quality","Just got the Terk about an hour ago. I'd been using my old broken Radio Shack rabbit ears since I canceled cable & was waiting for these. The terk only got 12 channels in one configuration (horizontal UHF) & 6 with the other (vertical UHF). I tried everything, scanning and rescanning with the TV. I've already repacked the Terk and it's going back. I'm sticking with the rabbit ears, which are about 10 years old & not HD, but they get 33 channels with MUCH better picture quality. In South Beach, rabbit ears appear to get better reception than all my neighbors more expensive HDTV antennas.Also, the cord comes from the bottom of the antenna, and I could not get the antenna to stay upright, not even on the floor. I wish I had seen some bad reviews before I purchased, but I only saw good ones. This is the first thing I've gotten through Amazon that I haven't been happy with."
2,Not useful in San Francisco Bay Area,"Have a fairly new HDTV with no cable. Antenna easy to set up and install.Live in Oakland and cannot get signals for PBS stations KQED/KCSM inSan Francisco and San Mateo about 10-15 miles distant. This antenna maywork in some situations, but for me it was a waste of money."
3,Come on thats it?,Maybe it works for others but as for me it works as well as putting a paper clip in the back of the T.V -___- $38 down the drain.
4,"Great reception, needs better stand/cable management","Was able to get great reception for both UHF and VHF channels(which I was not able to do with the (Paper Thin Leaf Indoor HDTV Antenna - Made in the USA!). After checking antennaweb.org and pointing the rabbit ears accordingly, the TV signal was great. The only thing that keeps this from getting a five is the fact that the stiff coaxial cable pushes the light antenna around and it wasn't until after taping it down that it could sit flat. If the base had more weight to it, or there was better cable management to hold it in the base I would give it a five."
3,Expected More but OK,"I thought this antenna might be different but once again the indoor antennas prove to be not that dependable yet. Depending on the day some stations are picked up and some are not and it changes from day to day, hour to hour. If you don't want the expense of satellite or cable or are unable to hard wire its serviceable but there is still no replacing a hard wired receiver and set."
5,Terk HDTV Indoor Amplified Hi Def Antenna,Great product. I am able to get channels that I have never received before. Great transaction. Quick and easy.
2,Antenna with Amplifier? I don't think so,"The Terk antenna did its job -- receiving the TV signal. Since I am only 10 miles from the tower, it is not surprising. Other than channels from the TV tower 10 miles away, no other channels are picked up. What surprise me is that when I try to apply the pre-amplifier, there is no effect on the receiver. The signal strength is exactly the same with or without the pre-amplifier. This makes me wonder what is the functionality of the amplifier? I paid 20 more bucks for the amplifier, how could I make my $20 working?Of course, it is not bad, that is why I put 2 stars there. But it does not reach my expection for its price."
2,You'd do better to purchase a simple RCA antennae,This product did not live up to expectations. I live in a metropolitan area and did not experience a marked increase in reception. I did much better with a cheaper RCA HDTV antennae.
5,super,This was far better than I had expected. My picture is crystal clear in my local channels.The only thing to keep in mind when buying this product is the farther above ground you are able to place it will improve your signal quality.40 dollars I paid as where Best Buy was asking 80 dollars.
3,Slightly better than rabbit ears,"I bought this to use with an eyeTV unit on my laptop. while I was waiting for Amazon's free shipping (over a week) I use an old rabbit ears antenna from a small TV we have upstairs in the guest room. The Terk is a little better. It is highly directional, so I have to move it to go from channel 2 to 62 a few times. Also the wire coming out of the bottom makes it very unstable. Probably have to duct tape it. It also takes up quite a bit of room on my desktop (remember I'm using it with a laptop) I guess if I had it to do over I'd keep shopping. It's built well (except for the poor design with the cable location) and does work, but there has to be a better one out there."
2,Couldn't get it to work!,"I tried setting this up in both Erie, CO and in Boulder, CO (right downtown) and was unable to get it to reliably pull a good picture at either place. I returned the item and my search for a device like this continues."
2,NOT A GOOD BUY,"The stand on this antenna was very unstable and easy to tip over. I recently purchased a digital TV and because I don't have cable I need to use an antenna. This one was touted to be great in bringing in digital signals. It was awful. My regular rabbit ears worked better than this one, so I sent it back and am again using my old rabbit ears, which work pretty good. I would not recommend this antenna."
3,Terk amplified HD antenna,"Not a bad antenna. However, I found that the amplifier had no effect. The home-built DB2-type antenna (unamplified) did better for me."
2,Didn't live up to expectations at all,"I just wasn't thrilled with this purchase. I kept on reading reviews where people said they live up to 45 miles from TV stations and still got coverage. I live roughly 10-12 miles from my locals and I didn't get much of a signal at all. Maybe if you live in the heart of a city you can use this, but I stay in suburban North Jackson, MS and it's not a prime location for this antenna. I ended up going with a Philips $34 from Wal-Mart and it works sufficiently. I will admit that for my area, I probably need an outdoor antenna, but the Philips I have now does a lot better than the Terk. The Terk, on a good day, would bring in roughly seven stations, but only ABC and sometimes CBS had any quality worth viewing. My antenna now pulls in roughly 15 stations and six or seven have good-to-excellent quality. This should hold me over until my local stations come in on DirecTV."
1,Very Low Signals,"I purchased this product with a lot of excitement after reading all the positive reviews. I live in San Gabriel Valley, close to mountains and this antenna didn't meet my expectations. It had very low signals and I could hardly see SOME of the local channels. Unfortunately, I had to return it to Amazon for a full refund."
2,Antenna not as good as reviews state,"I replaced some ugly, old rabbit ears with this HDTV antenna hoping to get AS GOOD a signal as I was already getting, but in a more compact and attractive package. My ten year old rabbit ears, with one of the ""ears"" broken off by the way, gets better HDTV reception than this antenna. I tweaked it every possible way that I could, and still couldn't pick up 2 of the 6 channels I used the old antenna to get. Going back to the rabbit ears and doing more research... Too bad. $40 down the drain. Also, this thing is practically useless without both of its rabbit ears (not shown in the misleading picture) fully extended and outstretched, so if by looking at the picture you find it hard to believe that you can get an antenna this compact to pick up so many channels, it's because it's not true."
3,Good antenna but you don't really need it!,"This is a good product but if you are in a metropolitan area or don't live too far away from one, you don't really need this antenna. You can find the broadcast signals in your area from this site: http://www.antennaweb.org/aw/Address.aspx.I realized too late that my old $10.00 UHF/VHF antenna is just as good in receiving HTDV signals as this one. So try a cheap antenna from one of the local big box stores before you buy this or any other more expensive antenna.I am giving this product 3 stars because although it's reception is as good as my old antenna, it's odd shape makes it too wobbly and I am having a hard time in finding a good place to keep it."
4,Works fine but design could be better,"I'm only about 5-6 miles from most local stations, so this antenna works well for me. HD pictures look great! However, as others have noted, this antenna is much larger than it looks in the picture.My only complaint is the poor location of the amplifier. Instead of being in the antenna base like many others (including some Terks), it's inline and near the end of the coax. Since you cannot unplug the power line from the amp, you either have to get the whole amplifier or power supply through a fairly large opening into a TV stand or entertainment center or (as I did) buy a connector to add on an extra length of coax to go through the opening. This location also means that the power input has to run almost to the TV rather than just plugging into the antenna base. (Note: if you have a power strip inside your TV stand this won't be an issue for you.)Outside of this fairly brain-dead design decision, the unit is fine."
1,Didn't Work!,"We added a second HDTV to the household and decided to try an off-air antenna before connecting to the pre-existing cable. Purchased the Terk HDTVa and the Antenna Direct Clearstream 2. The Terk HDTVa did nothing - absolutely no difference in reception between the TV without an antenna and the reception with the Terk. By contrast, the Antenna Direct Clearstream 2 produced better-than-cable quality video. In fairness to the Terk, the transmitters in our area are at the limit of its stated reception - 40 to 45 miles; also the Clearstream is a somewhat more expensive antenna and was given about an 8 foot elevation advantage (attic) over the Terk. Still, the Terk was highly disappointing and I do not recommend it."
3,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High Def Antenna,"I had purchased this antenna for my mother to be able to get more cable channels on her High Definition TV. After 3 weeks of trying to fine tune, I decided to take it out and return it because we could not get a good location to get uninterrupted service. We had studied many antennas before purchasing this one,and after speaking to a man at Walmart that was very well educated and experienced with the antennas this was the one he recommended. He did say however, it does have to be placed perfectly to be able to get the uninterrupted shows and we just gave up before we were able to find that perfect spot and direction. The picture was beautiful however once we were able to find the location, yet the reception lasted a few hours and then out again."
1,not one channel!,"I live only 6 miles out of Seattle. I know we have clouds, but c'mon. This antenna did not pick up anything."
2,Just not worth it to me,"I'm sorry. Call me vain. But this antenna is an eyesore. It's oddly shaped and prone to tipping over. Can't house it anywhere practical. Anywhere. There's not that many options in my setup to hide this contraption so between Netflix, you tube, and the available HD channels my basic cable service provides.....I'll have to make due. I'm selling mine.BTW, it didn't pick up any programming I was interested in or provide quality picture."
1,Barely works,I live in San Diego and this antenna barely works. Granted not every antenna will work here due to the hills but I have another outdoor antenna as well and it outperforms this by a long shot.
3,Did not live up to expectations,"Bought this to view off-air channels in eastern Queens, NY. Initially, it performed well, however after about a week, could not get reception on the higher-end VHF stations such as channels 11 and 13. Tried repositioning but could not find one that worked. It's possible that no antenna will work in my location, but returned this and will try another."
4,Greatly Satisfied,"Initially, I was disappointed ""because of my technical iliteracy."" However, I contacted the service center, did a smooth communication, and the problem solved very quickly."
4,it works,"got this about a year ago. HD picture looks fantastic on my panasonic viera plasma. i just have the built-in speakers, but they sound good too. i do have to have the antenna in the window, pointed in a very specific direction, otherwise i don't get certain channels. plus i have to have the bunny ears extended all the way. so if you don't want to have to look at the thing, you should probably get an external antenna. otherwise this one provides great picture, once you get it pointed in the right direction..."
1,Returned product was broke,"Returned product was broken, was awkward to keep balanced, once hooked up nothing, tried on a different tv nothing, then discovered the switch was broken"
1,did not work,I think the manufacturer should specify condition under which this Antenna will NOT work.. it did not work for me
3,I was able to watch just 8 channels,"The reception is pretty good, but I was only able to watch 8 channels. In the description of this product (in internet) says we will be able to watch 20 channels, but it is not true, just channel 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 13.1 and 13.2. I was not able to watch neither channel 4, and 5, nor any Spanish channel, such as Univesion or Telemundo, that we can see freely with other antenas."
2,Please sit completely still...,Great video and sound quality... if you sit completely still. As soon as anyone in the room moves who is in front of the antenna it loses it's signal. Arrggghhhh.
3,Terk HDTVa Indoor amplified HD Antenna,"It looks very cool.I connected this antenna to LCD TV and the Power Injector into a AC outlet. When I switched the Power Injector ""ON"" for amplificatin but I noticed there's no differences between ""ON"" and ""OFF"". I have even no way to tell it's on(no LED). I am wordering how others tell the Power Injector ""ON""."
1,Doesn't Work,"After spending hours fiddling with this it doesn't work. We live in a townhouse community so maybe it was blocked but we moved TV and all to a window area and still nothing. Will be returning this unit, we didn't even get a smidgen of a reception - just static, there was no difference if it was on or off. This was used with a new TV."
1,Not good for long distance,"This antenna will not work in my area, SIMI VALLEY CA. i needed a out door antenna .other wise it was easy to set up"
4,One of the best indoor antennas,"This is probably one of the best indoor antenna's out there. I gave it four stars (not five) due to how finnicky it can be in pointing it to the right direction. I was having so much trouble capturing local tv stations in my area and this device picks up all of them, some other antennas I tried failed to do so.It will get both SD and HD channels. You may spend a bit of time pointing it in the right direction to get the best signal.Best of all, unlike most other antennas, it maintains a clear signal; once its set, you can forget it. No dropouts, garbled screens etc once its pointed properly. Great indeed."
2,Very big...,"This antennae works better than the smaller ""internal"" antennae, but it is really just too big. It started getting most of the channels pretty good, but now many of them are fuzzy. I am returning it, and looking for something else."
5,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High Definition Antenna,I chose a five star rating because the Terk antenna works better than all of the previous antenna's I purchased. I have bought many antenna's and they did not work very well. With the Terk antenna I am able to receive 69 channels crisp and clear. When I had my other antenna's I had to reposition them continuosly. I only have to reposition the terk antenna for 3 channels. For the rest of the channels I leave the antenna in one place. The Terk antenna has a longer range than the other antennas I purchased.The longer range allows me to view more channels. I was frustrated for 2 years as I tried to watch television with my other antenna's that did not work. The Terk antenna has allowed me to enjoy watching television again.
3,Mid-range indoor VHF-UHF antenna,I ordered this antenna because it supposedly had a gain of twice that of ordinary rabbit ears and UHF loop. It did not seem to be any better than what it replaced.
5,Terk HDTV Antenna,Used this Antenna when my Satellite Provider was having issues with providing local channels. It really picked up my local HD channels.
3,Decent for UHF but don't count on VHF,"I bought this antenna to pick up the local stations for my TivoHD and after setting it up and running about 60' of RG6 cable from my roof ridge to my TiVo I was happy to see a nice variety of HD stations pop up with very good pictures.To my surprise, the CBS station wasn't showing up. It is on the same tower and the same distance as the majority of other networks and pbs stations (353 degrees from my house and 28 miles away).So I get NBC, ABC, PBS, WB, etc... which are all UHF in the same direction and roughly the same distance. Oddly, I also get FOX which is VHF, 350 degrees, and 27.1 miles. But I can't get CBS which is VHF, 353 degrees, and 38.4 miles.I've fiddled with the orientation and turned the signal booster on and off and there's no difference in the channels I receive.I'm a little bummed about missing CBS-HD but happy with this small, easy to install, antenna otherwise."
4,Picks up signals very good.,"This antenna is currently used in a basement and I'm about 15-20 miles from the broadcast antenna. Right out of the box, I am able to pick up most of the stations in the area. There are a couple of stations that are weak and it has a hard time picking these up. I will eventually move the antenna up to the attic of my 2 story house. This should greatly improve the operation of the antenna. The only complaint I have is that the base is way too small. It is easily knocked over."
3,Will not work for everybody,"This item will work differently for everyone. For some it works great & for others it's worthless. As for me, it works somewhat. It gets some HD channels but not all. But the channels that do come in have a great picture. If you know someone who owns one ask to borrow it to see how well it will work for your situation. If you can't then it's just a gamble."
3,Good if you have a clear shot.,"I didn't have much luck using this antenna. I am not far from the distro towers either. Being in a building that faces the wrong way and only being on the 6th floor doesn't help either. If you are going to use this. Make sure you have a clear shot out your window to the distro towers. If not quality is going to make you cry. On another note. Everyone on campus agreas with me. ""My Public Brocasting Station comes in real nice in hd""."
4,HDTV-the cheap way,With this I'm able to save a bundle every month-why pay for HD when you don't have to? Now I can use that $$ to get a movie or something worthwhile...
4,Good for an indoor antenna,"Works good at night, but on the same channel in the same position, during the day the reception is much worse."
1,This thing is junk,"I bought this antenna with the recommended Zinwell TV box. Both are junk. The reception is best described as what it would be like if you were trying to watch satellite TV in a hurricane. If you buy this with the Zinwell box the only thing you will remember from your viewing experience is ""Bad or no signal!""I seldom review what I buy, but I thought it was my obligation to warn people from buying these products."
3,"Looks cool, but reception is frustrating","Picture quality is fantastic when it gets good reception. However, getting good reception can be frustrating. You need to point the antenna in different directions in order to receive different channels. This is not a good product for just flipping through the channels. We don't watch much TV and we only watch certain programs, so setting up the antenna for that program is not a problem, but we still get a few hiccups in reception. The antenna sits on the mantle a few feet from the TV, so it's possible that there is a better place to put the antenna, but we haven't found it. I would only spend about $20 on this antenna."
1,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna,"The terk HDTVa might work for some people, but it did not work for me. Before you buy it try using a cheap uhf/vhf antenna. You might find one at the 99 cent store. I tried out a cheap antenna that I had laying around in my garage and it worked so much better."
2,Too lightweight,"This antenna is so lightweight that the base can't hold it.When the ""rabbit ears"" are extended the whole thing can topple over.I was very disappointed."
2,Get an outdoor model,"Well, this antenna looks interesting, but I found the reception spotty at best. Better to get a model that can be mounted in the attic or side of the house..."
2,Doesn't work for me!,I live in an APT 3 miles from broadcast center (NYC). Only receive two channel with snow. Maybe there are two many high-rise buildings. Returned.
1,only for HDTV,"It doesn't fit my TV. I call the customer service, no reply. At last, I found that this antenna was only for HDTV,and I didn't know it when I bought."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this after reading the reviews. I wanted an upgrade to my current, cheaper RCA antenna. I didn't get a single channel, even thought I can get about 8 channels with my much cheaper antenna. I will be returning this one. I had to give it one star, but really didn't want to give it any stars."
4,I Turn My Cable Off!,The only reason I gave this four stars is because it took my husband a week to figure out how to use this. When he finally got it to work the picture quality was amazing. I had a cable box which I recently turned in and the picture was much better with the Terk antenna than the box I was wasting my money on. No more cable bill. Now if we could do something about the internet.
2,Not for me,I live at the foot of a hill facing away from the source of the signals. This didn't work for me. It is also kind of large and silly looking.
3,Terk HDTVa indoor antenna,"Arrived on time and setup was easy. I can not blame the product, I have to blame my location but I can only get 1 or sometime two stations and they very from day to day"
1,"Poor reception, rabbit ears.","Firstly, this unit uses rabbit ears for VHF. If you will be using VHF then get ready for the unsightly rabbit ears.Secondly, the signal strength for UHF was 23 dB while with a Mohu Leaf it was 29 dB. The poor reception makes it unusable."
1,"didn't work in catalina, az",This only brought in one clear english channel and 2 spanish. I sent it back.
4,A good performer,"It works far better than my old non-amplified, rabbit-ear antenna: I get about twice the number if DTV channels and most of them without any flickering (DTV channels don't have any image distortion or snow, but you may occasionally experience some image flickering). It's also more discreet and better looking than I expected. The multi-element directional antenna is for UHF while the folding rabbit-ears are for VHF. I kept the rabbit-ears folded since I don't have many VHF channels (Note that most DTV channels are UHF although their virtual channel number is between 2-13). Some reviewers wrote that it's a bit unstable; I don't think that this is an issue, as long as it's on a flat surface."
3,Better than nothing...,"whether it is the broadcast signal or the unit, it is very difficult to get a digital picture reliabley when attached to a brand new name-brand TV. The antenna is used in Yonkers, NY, a city next to New York City. I thought reception would not be a problem; I was wrong.There is no way to tell if the poor performance is the result of the antenna or the digital signal, so if I were you, I'd wait a bit to see more discussion on how to determine the cause of generally poor over-the-air reception on new TVs. If you can put up with intermittent pictures, buy an antenna or make your own per YouTube instructions."
3,Close but no cigar,"This antenna was well made, but the track underneath the base wouldn't hold the cord in and made the antenna wobbly. It did just okay at receiving programs, but not any better than my 10+ year old Jensen 930. I returned it after 12 days and got a full refund the next day after Amazon received it."
2,Didn't work,"I could not receive one channel clear enough to watch. I bought this antenna to hook up to a new Sony 60"" 1080P TV and immediately boxed it up and sent it back. I liked the design and modern look, but it did not perform at all."
2,No range,"This does not have the range that it states it does. I even called their customer service person and asked about this and agreed with me. Maybe useful for people in the city near a tower, other wise it is pretty useless."
1,total disappointment,I was totally dissappointed in my new HDTV antennae as NO stations had anywhere close to clear reception.That being said I do have mountains to the south which are problematic for this indoor antennae.Michael in Phoenix.
2,Terk HDTVa is aggravating,"I bought this thing and have not had a moment of peace. I live in an apartment and had read reviews on how it works in an apartment and they were not too bad. So I went ahead and took a chance that because of the way my apartment is situated--that it may work better than average for me. Well first of all it will not pull in the 15 channels I'm supposed to be getting. Second of all I'm constantly adjusting the antenna just to get a few channels to come in without that choppy look and choppy noise coming in. And you can't walk past the signal if you do it will go out, you get the choppy picture or it disappears all together. Needless to say, I am very disappointed. If anyone knows of a antenna that works best in an apartment please let me know because this one sucks.Sincerely,Patricia"
1,product sucksss,i bought this product after reading all the reviews i will keep it simple and easy it sucks i get no receptions. My old antenna is 5 times better than this i only got like 3 channels and those didn't even work.i read the reviews and almost everyone said it was good but it was a piece of crap i wasted my time putting it up and waited for days for it to get delivered but once i got it it just was a piece of crap.
5,Terk HDTV Antenna,Appears to be receiving the HD channels that I expected and no signal loss. Much better than previous HD antennas.
4,"Works Well, But Amplified??","I don't have HDTV now, but needed better rabbit ears for the TV without cable. I thought it wise to get this HD model for the TV I ""wish"" I had and I'm sure one day will. This antenna is with a TV on a digital converter box. I now pick up an extra channel (from L.A.).But as far as the amplified part goes, I've tried switching it off and don't find any noticeable difference. I live in an old house (1925) with one outlet in every room. So with this Terk, converter box, DVD, VCR, and the TV, that room has WAY to many wires.Buying this has made me realize how dependent (plugged in) we are on electric power. It seems when we plug in, Nature, The Natural World, pays the bill. I'm trying to use less, as we all should, or at least remember that our electrical supply system we have now, is unsustainable i.e. nonrenewable.That said I'm off to a cave in the woods. lol"
1,Bought & paid for reviewers,"I bought this antenna, believing my troubles were over, based on the majority of the reviews. Boy was I in for a suprise! It brings in one station just a little better than before, another station, the sound is better. Overall, I get 8 stations, the same as with my broken rabbit ears. Plus the fact that you must have the antenna lined up perfectly for any clarity. Based on my experience, I would say quite a few someones were paid to write their reviews. Dude"
1,Makes a Lovely Paperweight,And also gave my children an amusing exhibition of what it was like to try to tune in a station on a TV circa 1963. Pulled in weak signals from about 3 stations 18 miles from NYC broadcast towers.
1,My Rabbit Ears Were Better; Their Customer Service Was Appalling,"Since this was so highly rated on Amazon, I bought it. I received fewer channels than when I put my little rabbit ears up. So, I took it down and tried to return it. Amazon wouldn't take it, J&R Music sales wouldn't take it, Terk wouldn't take it. I waited 32 days to return it (they had a 30 day policy - I'm sure it was written somewhere). The customer service representative at Terk said, ""Yeah, this isn't the right antenna for your application"", but he wouldn't let me return it or exchange it. DO NOT BUY THIS ANTENNA."
1,Doesn't work!,"I purchased this product with all good faith that it would work and I would be replacing my rabbit ears. Sorry but this so-called HDTV antenna only picked up about three stations. This is the second Digital antenna I've tried and still no luck. The rabbit ears are picking up almost all of my favorite stations with the exception of a few from PBS which are weak to begin with.Again, sorry, but unless I've hooked it up wrong (and I know I haven't), it is a disappointment. I really think that the stations themselves need to boost their signals more as I've made it a point to write them about it.K"
3,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna,"Works just as well as an standard TV antenna. No better no worse. Especially since there is no such thing as a HD tv antena, UHF/VHF channels are broadcast over the air and standard antennas can pick up this signal. The TV itself is either HDTV or Analog."
1,poor performance than other cheaper antenna,"I have cheaper antenna (Zenith ZHDTV1 HDTV-UHF Digital Indoor Antenna) and this expensive one. Through comparison, this one is terrible. I get better pictures, more HD channels (11 more than Terk's 2) and better stability with Zenith antenna than this Terk antenna. This one will go to Goodwill."
2,Not Needed with Elgato Eye TV,"To take advantage of HD capabilities of the I-Mac, reviews recommended this Terk antenna. It is a high quality product physically, although MUCH larger than you might expect it to be. Very difficult to position on our computer desk. It was easy to assemble and hook up to the computer, but we found the software to be difficult to manipulate to pull in any more than 10 HD channels, most of which we didn't want (i.e. Al Jazeera, Nigerian TV, etc.). We live in the Washington area and we were really disappointed, expecting to have a wider selection. It didn't pull in the multiple HD versions of WETA or MPT public TV channels. We purchased the Elgato Eye TV at the same time as this antenna and found that when connected to the cable TV wall plate it alone pulled in a much larger set of both HD and analog channels. Although it was an extra $100, it was worth it. Ended up returning the Terk antenna. Can't say enough about the Elgato EYE TV and the I-Mac."
1,Product was useless in the city of Chicago,I live in a residential neighborhood in Chicago. I am not near any high rise buildings. The antenna failed to bring in anything but one very fuzzy station.
4,picks up weak HDTV signal normally not received by regular rabbit ears,"I don't have cable (who needs it? :) ) so all I had when the DTV transition happened was a pair of amplified set-top rabbit ears. When the transition happened, I could pick up a lot of channels except a local channel and, unfortunately, PBS.DTV signals are very directional and easily interfered with, especially when you're in the fringe coverage area (as I am).The TERK antenna improved reception significantly and I really don't mind the funky look of the. It took several trials to find out the perfect orientation and, importantly, height of placement. I had to elevate the antenna quite high.But now, I'm getting all the channels that I want to watch without changing orientation."
4,Works for me,"I'm in SF Bay Area, about 30 miles from Sutro Tower. This was my first antenna and it worked out of the box for me. It is not perfect and I'm holding between 70 and 90% signal strength on all the majors with better reception than satellite. I can't compare it to any others but to say ""it doesn't work"" is insane. You won't know until you try it. This is not an all or nothing deal. It will work great for some, not at all for others and anywhere in between.To check your specific situation, I recommend you try www.antennaweb.org. Click button on first page, enter your full address and you will get a report unique to your home about how/where your channels are broadcast, including a map showing exactly how you should point your antenna. In my case, all my required channels were ""yellow"" and all in the same compass direction. If you are very far from broadcast source or channels are coming from many different directions, it may not work. However, with good return policy, it can't hurt to try."
2,Terk HDTV Amplified indoor antenna,"The item was shipped promptly. The setup was easy but unfortunately I was unable to get any reception. I tried on 2 separate HDTV and got the same result. The closest station is around the threshold of 30+ miles from my area which indoor antenna should be able to cover. But in my case, it failed to pick up any signal."
5,terk hdtv antenna,the terk hdtv indoor antenna i bought is GREAT. i would recommend it. highly effective. will buy more when need arises. top stars. john veillon/marrero la
3,works for some but not for others,"Just recieved this from amazon recently i have been messing around with it for the past 4 days, even put it in the attic to see what i could get ......... one channel i get that is a digital channel and its local. i get no other channels with any visible reception. i hope to replace my original bunny ears + uhf receiver. this works almost the same except the amplifire gave me a 50 % instead of a 30% on my one channel. over all i would rate this product for myself personally ........ around a 3. i was expecting this thing to pick up alot more then my original 1 channel i got with antenna poles. .. i guess it just depends on where u live. i did an antenna search online but still no luck"
2,Doesn't work for me,"I've bought this Antenna so I could receive two channels that are in VHF frequency. My former antenna was UHF only and it broke after my several tries to make it work for the VHF channels.I saw the good reviews on this one and thought I'd give it a try but it just doesn't work for me.I don't leave that far from the TV towers and the land is somewhat flat, but even so the VHF receiving is a challenge with this antenna.I cannot find a positioning that would work for both channels... I can have one channel at 75% and the other will be at 50%.... even the slight change on the antenna positioning would make me loose signal.If your problem is with the VHF channels, go try and find a better deal.Oh, by the way, the amplification doesn't do anything for me.. It doesn't matter if the switch is on or off, signal level is always the same but you cannot unplug it from the wall, the signal will disappear even if the switch is off...."
5,Amazing Fringe Area Reception,"I bought the Terk HDTVa antenna for use in a fringe reception area in Maine while traveling. At first I couldn't believe the fantastic reception, but quickly became used to receiving extra stations along with excellent digital quality. The best antenna of it's type I've ever used."
2,"Good technology, poor design","What the picture doesn't show you is that this item has rabbit ears, and they will need to be extended for it to work. Not a problem except for the fact that the base is incredibly narrow, leading it to be very unstable. So in a nutshell, this works pretty well 'til it falls over and break the rabbit ears. Why, oh why didn't they make this with a wider base?"
2,It didn't work for me,"Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV ReceptionThis product sounded really good, but when I received it and hooked it up I found that it didn't do any better than my cheap rabbit ears. It also was very unwieldy and was very difficult to move from one spot to another and then there was the problem of placing it on top of my TV where I usually have my antenna. It seemed like it was always off balance and falling over."
4,Love It!,Works as advertised. I had a RCA amplified antenna I was using but still could not get some of the channels as I live several miles from most towers. I now receive all channels.
5,Great DTV antenna,"This antenna works as advertised.Also has improved analog reception over my old antenna. I'm using this antenna on the second story of a house that has a 2-1/2 acre wooded green belt between me and Seattle's TV signals. And for the current stations that are broadcasting digital over the air, the reception is excellant...I finally think I've found a 'keeper'."
2,Amplification is useless.,"I bought it mainly because the description said it had an amplification antenna. There is a separate power cable for the amplification. How different is the signal reception with and without amplification? I can say for sure that there is absolutely NO difference. Rather, the reception is better with the amplification turned off. I didn't used any other antennas since I already got this, but many reviews say its performance is below average, and I believe those reviews are correct. It's a mediocre quality antenna, and I strongly do NOT recommend this."
3,Be patient,"Pros: Good picture once you get it positioned!Cons:1) Often the cleanest ""No Signal!"" picture I've ever gotten on set!2) Bulky and UGLY!!3) Be prepared to exercise your patience with it. You will have to reposition it with every new power-up/channel change. The ""optimal"" position for this eyesore is often in the hardest-to-place positions: i.e. 6"" off the floor, exactly 4"" to the right of, and 20"" in front of the television set...it was ugly out of the box, and now I have to add boxes, crates, etc. to place it on.4) Base of antenna is already too narrow to support it, and then the cord comes directly out of the bottom which makes it even less stable.5) Product photo led me to think antenna was not rabbit ears--these ARE rabbit ears, and so take up space required for RE.Conclusion:An improvement on straight amplified Radio Shack rabbit ears."
4,Works as advertised,"Very good feed when in the right position. Have to move it around quite a bit and then not touch it or go near it after it's in the right spot, but for the price and not having to pay 90 bucks a month to a cable company I'll take it."
4,Alien Communicator works well as antenna!,The antenna works very well with easy setup. It located many more channels than three separate units I had tried earlier.I'll be sticking with this one although I'll try to find a place where it's not so visible. Doesn't go well with most decor themes. Function is what truly counts and it functions very well.
4,Works Great!,We borrowed a couple other styles from friends before getting the terk and this one is just a better antenna. It brings in all the channels in our area with just minor adjustments to it's position. The only drawback is the really small base. It already got knocked off the shelf once and bent one of the aerials.
3,Beat up Zenith still works better for me,"I have the old Zenith indoor antenna mentioned by a couple of other reviewers. The build quality really is laughable. I took the antenna vanes off when I put it in my suitcase to transport across the country, but the stand separated/broke from the plastic tower that rises up and supports the vanes. The most fragile kids' toy wouldn't do that. Hard to imagine how this could have happened to a well padded item but it did.So I got the Terk because of good reviews and... no HD reception or very little. I'm in a tough area, 30 miles from the transmitter. And calibrations for all stations seem to have changed since the digital conversion. Still it could provide only spotty reception for the very few channels in my area.Then I plugged back in the Zenith and it worked just fine. The Terk is obviously better engineered but the junky Zenith works better in my situation. Time to get out the gaffers tape...."
3,"Well made, but did not work in my setup","I live on the first floor of a 4-story, 40-condo apartment building in a northern suburb of Chicago. Most of the over- the-air TV transmissions come from Chicago about 16 air miles away.I installed an HDTV tuner card in my computer, which is specifically designed to receive over-the-air digital TV signals.With this antenna placed as high in the room and as near to the windows as possible, I was able to receive only a few digital TV signals with sufficient strength to actually view them comfortably.I then connected my HDTV tuner computer card to a roof antenna that I can access via cable connections in the walls of my apartment. The reception was greatly improved, and I was able to watch HDTV transmissions of the recent winter Olympics on the computer monitor, which were quite satisfactory.This well-made antenna did not work for me, but should work better under different conditions."
3,Holds HDTV signal 98% of the time.,After reading the reviews for several different antenna I thought I could get away with having this internal antenna. I live in Portland OR among many 2 story houses but they are far apart and 12 miles from most TV towers. This antenna even though I have it sitting in my room at cieling level will not hold the hdtv signal 100% of the time. A friend who also has an HDTV ended up installing an external antenna and never has signal issues so I guess I will have to route the wires and buy something that I can attach outdoors to the roof. 98-99% of the time the picture is excellant but you get chop every once in a while and it seems to be worse when rain storms come through.
2,Not as Good as UHF option,"I bought specifically because I was having difficulty with VHF 6 (yes, in Albany NY, CBS does not broadcast on the UHF spectrum, but on LOW BAND VHF. I'm approximately 25-30 miles from the tower and there are no obstacles. I was using a Winegard SquareShooter, which is a UHF only antennae, but was bringing in VHF 6 with around a 55 signal strength on my TiVo. Once in a while there would be some blockiness to the picture (about every 20 minutes). For $35 I thought I'd rectify the situation.Considering this is specifically a VHF/UHF antennae I thought this was a slam dunk, especially considering the reviews. Unfortunately, no matter where I placed it, I could not get better than a 55 signal strength, and most of the time it was below 50.If you live in a city within 15 miles of a LOW VHF signal, you'll probably make out great, but over 20 miles this just isn't a very good antennae."
3,Didn't change my TV reception the way I expected,"I do not have cable or an outside antenna. I do get all regular available channels in my den but in my bedroom, two of the channels I cannot get signals on. I bought this so I could put it on my bedroom TV in hopes it would be able to get the two I am missing. Unfortunately, it has had no impact so I bought this and it doesn't offer me any more than my old rabbit ears."
1,Worst Antenna,"My house is located in the centralized area of Orange County. I bought a cheap looking antenna from Radioshack, but I have to move antenna when I switch different group of channels (i.e. CBS to NBC). I am tired of having to adjust that antenna so I decide on this Terk antenna since it has many good reviews. The setup is very easy and I follow all instructions from the manual and the website (angling the antenna at certain direction), but it didn't pickup reception from any local channel (2-13). I gave up trying after over 50 adjustments and scanning for channels without picking any local channel. Unless I am getting a defected item? Should I return this piece of junk?"
2,Indoor TV Antenna,"This was of little help to me in receiving a clear connection. As a matter of fact, it hardly helped at all. I was very disappointed.Pam"
2,Terk HDTVa Antenna,Dissappointed. Fortuneately I did not pay regular price. While waiting for unit to arrive I purchased a cheap antenna at Big Lots for $10 and got pretty decent reception. I thought that I would get significantly better reception with the Terk. Not so. Stop at your local Big Lots.
1,I get the same channels as the $15 Phillips antenna I bought at Walmart,"Man, I'm a sucker!My friend at Northpark told me this was the BEST antenna! So, I didn't have time to try it out, and I was like, you know, I'll just buy it cuz he was so happy with it.I live in Rivermark community, Santa Clara, CA. I get the same channels as the small, black $15 Phillips antenna from Walmart. And the Terk is so complicated with its plug and so bulky and obnoxious with its silver antenna. If it worked, I'd forgive it on its obnoxiousness and instead praise it. I live on the top floor.For a ""good"" antenna, I'd expect to at least get ABC and NBC, but I don't.I have a top of the line Sharp Aquos LCD.(if you live near me, you can come and test it out. if you like it, i may give it to you :)"
2,Unable to get most channels,"Have to keep retuning the channels. For a lot of channels, get voice only and seems to lose programming on the slightest of movement."
1,It's not good when a cheap $8 antenna outperforms this one,"I bought this antenna to start with, and I was generally satisfied with it's performance, but it did have a few hiccups in signal quality. I found this antenna on Amazon as well:RCA Basic Indoor Antenna, and I figured for $8 it was worth a shot. I was very surprised to find out that the cheap $8 antenna actually received a stronger and more reliable signal than the Terk antenna, and I actually received a few extra channels. Even with the amplifier turned on with the Terk I still had issues, yet the $8 antenna is unpowered, looks really flimsy, and gets a much more reliable signal. For $40 and for something twice the size, I would expect the Terk antenna to far exceed the capabilities of the cheap one, and it's clear to me that the $8 antenna puts this one in its place. I would strongly recommend going with theRCA Basic Indoor Antennainstead, or another antenna."
3,For my aera it is un impressive,For my aera it is un impressive. I live about 20 miles from Savanna Ga and still have to adjust the possession of the antenna all of the time to tune in to the channel I want
1,Didn't Pick Up a Thing,"Having just dropped cable since an incredible rate increase and the arrogant attitude - and pricing - displayed by Verizon, plus the idiocy of Dish and Direct satellites damaging apartment property, I am left with the only available option - or so I've been told - and that is to purchase an ""amplified hi-def antenna,"" yet this one is certainly not the right one! While I followed the easy directions, no matter how I adjusted, angled, mounted and fussed, I could not pick up even the grainiest station from inside my first floor apartment. If you, like myself, are residing within an apartment and have no attic or ability to affix an antenna to the exterior of your unit, DO NOT waste your money on this thing . . . it just will not work NO MATTER HOW CLOSE TO THE BROADCAST TOWER YOU MAY BE!"
3,Decent,The antennae is a bit too large and unappealing and gets a decent signal. Wish it were smaller as depicted in the images.
4,TV with no cable costs,"This product is not that attractive, but I have it on the floor behind my stereo speakers and it works fine!"
3,Not too impressed,"I live on the second floor of a brick apartment building, and I'm not sure if that could have affected the receiving quality of this antenna. I had expected to get nine local channels, but on a clear day I only got three."
5,San Francisco Northbay,This antenna works great in Marin County.I can get about 30 channels full HD no problem.The installation is a breeze
5,Well worth the purchase price,Cable and Dish were too much per month for too little good content. this antenna works very well. was wondering if there was an indoor HDTV antenna that was truly worth purchasing. happy to say there is.only con i can give is the base could be more stable. other than that a device that works as it should.
4,Better than most others for the price,"Works better than the flat basic antenna, but I'm in such a canyon that even located indoors on the top floor of my townhome doesn't get me all the channels available in my area. I've noticed that is I place it near the window and open the window it works better, so an outdoor antenna would clearly be a better choice for me. But it still does a pretty good job, especially for the money."
4,"Works great, looks crazy!",We live in the Houston area and this picks up every channel available to us. I wish we would have switched from cable years ago! It really exceeded our expectations. The only reason my review is 4 instead of 5 stars is because it looks pretty crazy. It has rabbit ears in addition to what you can see in the picture. Thankfully we can hide it behind our TV and TV stand and you can't see it at all.
3,Works great but is bulky and ugly...,The set up for this unit was easy and it got great reception in the Denver area. I returned it because I thought it was ugly and took up a lot of space. I ended up getting the Paper Thin Leaf Indoor Antenna - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QK7HI8/ref=oh_o03_s00_i00_details. Works just as well or better and is easily hidden behind furniture or picture.
2,"Nothing, not even a ghost.","Maybe it works for some people but not for me. I live about 25 miles from several transmitters and wanted to get just a few channels to watch while I exercise and avoid adding more bucks to my cable bill. I got nothing. No static, ghosts, or even noise. I guess my neighbor's house, about 50 feet away and a story taller than mine might have been the obstacle but I'll never know. I returned it after several variations of hook-ups and even trying another tv in the next room."
4,Very good Antenna,I only use this when electricty goes off. Works fine for me. I am able to get about 9 stations on my little TV. Used it when power was out for a week because of storm and was able to see local stations and find out what was going on in the world.
4,Terk HDTVa antenna review,"The Terk HDTVa antenna did the job I purchased it for--to receive with reasonable clarity my favorite local TV station(WMAZ, channel 13 in Macon,Ga.), some 30 miles away. To get the best reception, you must keep experimenting with different antenna positions."
3,HD antenna,I gave this to my brother and it picked up one ch.find but not others within 35 miles. He has alumium siding and i think that limited the range. We had to go with an outside model.
5,"Liked it so much I ""sold"" one to my neighbor","I previously received over the air signals from two cities. They are in opposite directions. I aimed my antenna at the city with the most channels. My TV was conveniently on that side of the apartment. To my surprise I also picked up the other city ""on the bounce"".I set my downstairs (first floor) neighbor up with one after giving her a demo. I have yet hear any complaints from her."
1,Rabitt ears works better,Live ten miles south of metroploitan area Connected unit to television- very poor picture and less channels
2,Rabbit ears are better,I bought this hoping to get a better signal then the 5$ rabbit ears I have currently. Well Rabbit ears win. Its not bad just not better than the rabbit ears.
4,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Reception,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna can pick up more channels than the one I used before. Pictures are crystal clear. One thing I'm not satisfied with is its stability - it is top heavy and can easily topple over.
3,Didn't pull channels with authority,"This antenna worked okay in my Omaha home - about on par with another flavor of indoor antenna. However, neither was anywhere close to the Winegard 9032 for pulling HDTV channels. All of this was done with a relatively new Panasonic Plasma TV with an HD tuner built-in. At my sister's home, the Terk antenna couldn't manage to successfully receive any channels, but the problem could have been the HDTV tuner in the TV. Using this antenna was the initial attempt, so I can't really blame the antenna for the problem."
1,Not worth the cost,"Would probably work on a rooftop, but doesn't perform in-house, even with a clear window view of the transmitting towers."
3,Average antenna,"Worked for about 2 weeks and the the power supply went out. Improved some channels but others that came in good were weakened. Hard to get in a good spot to improve reception, nothing seemed to change it for the better."
4,Good Alternative to Cable Bills,I live between Miami and West Palm Beach. I hooked this antenna to a 19 inch Sanyo HDTV (DP19647) in my office/bedroom. Transmission towers are anywhere from 20 - 40 miles away. I pick up 22 digital channels. It works really well.
5,Very good antenna,I purchased this for my parent's TV because they receive over the air signal and are now using a digital converter box. It works great and about 15 extra channels were picked up over what just the rabbit ears used to pick up.
3,"Better, still not perfect","I had been using another indoor amplified antenna, and saw this on sale, and decided to give it a shot. Over, it is OK, but don't expect this to cure all you HD reception problems.Advantages:Looks nice. Very well made and put together. It doesn't feel cheap.Easy to orient towards the receivers.Reception is fair to good.Disadvantages:Doesn't do well without a direct view to the transmitter (but none do).Still have some dropouts with most stations.Not much better than the much cheaper antenna it replaced."
1,You'll be sorry if you buy.....,"This works OK, but is the most user UN-FRIENDLY device I've ever owned. You will have to permanently glue or screw down to keep from topping over. Impossible to stand alone by itself. I swear at it everytime I use it. Very disappointed and would love to have a TERK executive use it for awhile. I'm sure they would change the design then."
5,Better than I'd hoped,"I live 12.5-12.6 miles from all my local TV station broadcasts. I purchased a Phillips Mant410 antenna at a local department store, for my 42"" Sharp Aquos. It worked pretty well on the UHF stations, but poorly on the VHF stations. So I thought I'd give the Terk HDTVa a try. This is what I found:Out of the box it is very easy to put together and setup, it took 2-3 minutes.It looks nice, but is slightly larger than I expected (I guess I should have read the dimensions).I am very impressed at how well all my local HD stations come in, this without the amplification turned on.The only problem is that it gets interference when someone walks in front of it. I alleviated this by placing it higher up.For my needs and situation I feel a 5 of 5 stars is warranted."
4,HDTV Rocks!,"For a number of reasons, I do not have cable TV, but wanted to be able to watch the 2008 Olympics this summer on my 52"" flat panel TV, so I thought I'd give an HD antenna a try before I broke down and called the cable company. I've discovered that I currently get about 10 HD channels. (A number that is bound to grow over time.) The High Definition channels come in crystal clear. It's very impressive -- and FREE!I've never had an HD antenna before, so I don't know how this one compares to other brands. But I can tell you that it works great, is handsome, and the price was reasonable. I haven't noticed that the UHF/VHF channels come in any better with this antenna than they did with my old ""dog ears"". However, the antenna does come with very specific and easy to follow instructions on how to get the best reception.Note that I had to program the TV before I could see any channels (HD or otherwise). This is a simple process, but it took me while to figure out that it needed to be done."
5,It works,"It pulls in HDTV signals over the air. It's UHF element is HIGHLY directional (a good thing if you live downtown like me and have to deal with multipath) and took a while to find the optimal direction. It allows me to pick up all the Seattle HDTV networks (NBC,ABC,CBS,FOX,PBS) and their sub channels with no problem. I went for this model because it has VHF elements too and after Feb 2009, some Seattle channels (CBS, I think) are going back to VHF, and I wanted to make sure my antenna still worked then."
2,Not so impressive,I bought 2 of these for my brand new HDTV's I had bought.Also to test the quality i bought $10 Phillips antenna from Walmart.I was surprised to see that there was no difference in picture quality.So basically it was below my expectations for the price I had paid for.Hope this helps.
3,It does work?,The power injector did not work. It was replaced by mail which I had to pay for the return service which I feel is not right. The new one I think works but I don't know for sure. The power injector is suppose to get warm and doesn't. Also I get the same signal strenght whether it is on or off.
3,"good reception, rabbit ears too long",Installed this indoor antenna in an unused room so all cable outlets can share its reception. Reception was fine but rabbit ears were too long and took up too much space. Replaced it with an outdoor antenna still installed indoor. Reception is similar but much less space is needed.
3,antenna review,I don't think that I hooked it up properly. At least on my TV - I've checked all channels and settings. It is bigger then I thought it was but it has a cool look going for itself.How it actually will bring in an HD signal has yet to be determined.
2,not the best antenna in the wolrd,"reception is great when you can find it but its very direction sensitive! it is also very top heavy.(falls over constantly) If your in a pinch, or not very handy this antenna is fine. However for a much better antenna that is far cheaper take a look at building a dtv antenna everything you need is probably laying around your house or can be bought at walmart for next to nothing."
2,Not as good as advertised,"Said it would pick up UHF & VHF 45 miles out.From 30 to 35 miles out it picked up UHF great, but not VHF.Would be very good if closer to the source."
5,That's good,I have no problem with it. I use this one over two years. That is good quality. As for me that is great to us
3,Good enough,It works fairly well. I can watch a couple of channels I like. I have to move it to different places in the house to get more channels.
2,HDTV antenna,"no better than rabbit ears. actually, I get less interference with rabbit ears. Unit is unsteady- has a very small base so if you have to adjust the attached antenna arms, the unit tips or keeps falling and has to be braced with something. An unstable and poorly contructed unit that can be dangerous around children due to falling and sharp areas."
4,Good Antenna,"I live downtown with many skyscrapers around, so I was worried that would interfere a lot with the tv signals but this antenna gets all our local HD channels perfectly.The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's larger than I thought it would be. The metal spokes do make it quite wide."
2,Did me no good,"The reviews for this antenna looked good, but so far it has not helped me. I can't say that is the antenna's fault, but more likely my location. Of note however is that my old rabbit ears work better than this antenna when they are connected to the amplifier that came with this antenna. Also, my colleague at work took it home to try it, but it didn't do him any good either. My guess is that if you are in a good location, this antenna would work for you....but I'm not sure how to figure out if your location is good or not until you try.Will try an outdoor antenna next, or maybe bite the bullet and pay for cable/sattelite."
1,Piece of junk,I think a coat hanger hooked to a car battery can pull in more channels than this thing. It only gets two channels and poorly at that. My old anntenna (analog) got all my local channels. Not Happy with this thing at all. Don't waste your money!!!!
1,Worthless to me,"If anyone hasn't already noticed, antenna reviews are all over the map. You can have one person have great luck with one, and then somebody else find the same model to be useless. I am in that last category.I bought my HDTVa antenna from Best Buy the other day and tried it out. First, as has been said before, one thing I didn't like right off the bat is that the cable is permanently attached to the unit -- it should be removable, so you could possibly use a longer cable if you wanted to.Next, and most importantly, the signals I got thru this antenna were junk. My TV did pick up the local HD channels (I am within 10 miles of all of them, no houses in my area above 1-story, no tall trees), but they looked about the same as my standard channels. I was not impressed at all. I returned the unit and will try a Zenith model that I hear good things about. If that doesn't help me, then I guess it's up onto the roof I go."
1,Mostly bad,"Not rating on its reception...- Base is not balanced, always have to struggle with it when you're adjusting to get a better signal. It will tip over because of the skinny base.-two metal anntenneas are poorly made, both of mine are already bent from a few adjustments.- this is not amplified..for the price of this item, it SHOULD be amplified. So reception of analog channels are usually poor."
1,Dont BUY IT,"Opon arrival i hooked it up and tryied it out on my brand new 32 inch flat screen sony, thought i could beat the hd pay for it scam. Comcast offers like 10 channels of HD for an extra 10 dollars a month, by the time i break down the times of the shows, the actual shows which blow, and the time i have to watch them i figured that i might as well buy the antenna to see what happens for free. Well nothing Happened, and now im stuck with this 30 dollar antenna that prommised the world. Maybey its my area, but i got notthing. 20 min of foolin around with this thing, trying differnt angles, positins, plugs, FORGET it."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this antenna to use with a LCD HDTV I installed in the guest room. While it gets most channels, it can not seem to receive the one channel I watch most, which is 33 miles away in San Jose. An old analog TV with a converter box and rabbit ears is able to receive that station, so I'm not terribly impressed with the amplification capability of the antenna. The reception is exactly the same whether the antenna is ""on"" ""off"" or unplugged! I've moved the antenna around in every position possible, and it's near a window and skylight, so I can't understand why it doesn't receive that channel. Perhaps I got a dud, but I'm less than thrilled with this product."
2,DIDN'T WORK WELL FOR ME,"TheTerk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Receptionworked very poorly (did I get a lemon?), so I am returning it. I live on the top floor of an apartment complex in an urban area with nothing I know of around me that would block any signals, but I was only able to get two channels with any consistent clarity, and that was some kind of cartoon channel. The device had very poor reception for the rest of the ten or so local channels it found."
4,Free tv,"It took a little work on my part. I knew I needed the converter box and I ordered it as a stand alone. I did not understand that I needed an antenna to make the converter box work. I did my research on indoor antenna and this appeared to be one of the best. The antenna was easy to set up, it was the converter box that was a challenge. It required set up after the antenna was attached. I figured it out, and now it all works. Sometimes there is drift and the signal is not good, but that happened with Dish tv as well, but my only cost is the equipment and no monthly fees."
1,terk antenna,"Forget it. It did not increase the quality of reception over the small antenna that came with my portable TV.Also, it's large and ugly and takes up a lot of space."
1,Terrible,"After reading some great reviews on this product, I thought I would try it. Well, if you can't hide it somewhere, it's very unsightly and just didn't pull in channels for me like I expected it to. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Very good but not great.,The antenna worked reasonably well but it did not perform as good as I hoped it would.
2,"Works, but poor quality",Product does work as advertised. The only problem is that when I received it the threads were missing on one of the cable connectors. How can this happen? Isn't the product tested before it goes out the door? There is no excuse for poor quality.
4,Great product but poor base design!,"I get great local channel reception. BUT - what were the design engineers thinking?!?! The base is WAY too small so the product will tip over with the slighest bump. The product also won't stay up straight unless the ""ears"" are in perfect balance."
5,Works in Tri-valley,"I live in the tri-valley (Dublin, Pleasanton, Livermore) which is a valley which obstructs signals from San Francisco and San Jose. I wasn't able to get many signals from a lower end Terk antenna. However, this one has worked well.It is directional so you have to make sure you point towards where the signal originates in order to not get interference. Great to not have to get basic cable."
4,Crystal Clear Reception,"I purchased this product after reading the many excellent reviews and now I am happy to add to them.I got very tired of paying for cable reception every month, especially since I do not watch very much TV, and the TV that I do watch is mostly regular broadcast.Right out of the box this new antenna has made me happy. The reception that I now have is actually BETTER than the picture quality I had from cable. I think that the amplification feature allows me to pick up channels from a nearby city. It was easy to set up and it hides nicely right behind my television so that I do not even see it. So far, so good."
2,Very disappointed,Excellent design. However I would not recommend it for a location where there is a slope in the backyard. It did not work for my location .
5,Terk HDTVa antenna saves huge $$ over cable!,"This is a dynamite product. We live in a pretty low area, and with our digital converter box and this antenna, we are getting roughly 17 stations, and they are crystal clear!! Prior to digital, we only got about 8 stations, and the quality of the reception varied widely. Not only that, I had to keep fiddling with the old system to adjust our previous antenna to get the stations that we did receive. Not so with this Terk HDTVa. I could not be more pleased, and it is very modestly priced. Kudos to Audiovox Corportion! To say we are delighted would be an understatement."
4,Antenna,The sntenns works good. But you need to be near a window and you have to pin point the ststion. I will go to and outside antenna later that has more DB gain.
4,Great antenna!,"I tried 3 different HD antennas before buying this one. None of the previous 3 gave me the channels I got with this one. This one definitely has much better range. Also, it comes with good information and web links that allows you to locate your local channel direction. I still have little picture freeze issue with channel 4 (WTMJ4) in Milwaukee, WI but a lot of people told me that it is the problem with the local broadcasting station that it is not strong enough. However, I could not get this good reception with any other antenna."
2,Terk Indoor Antenna,"After reading other peoples reviews on this item, some good, some bad, I decided I would also give it a try. The antenna just did not work that well for me as I am in an area that is surrounded by trees and hills. As far as its design? Two items could be improved on. A wider, heavier base is needed as the unit is somewhat top heavy. The coax, being rather stiff, does not sit well in the groove of the base, making the unit even more unstable, and the placement of the inline coax amplifier is placed in an inconvenient location. Would have been better if the amplifier was contained within the body of the antenna. I probably would have kept the unit if it would have worked for me and just lived with the above noted inconveniences, but unfortunately, the antenna just did not do its job, so the reason for my return. I hope other future customers will have better luck with this unit, and perhaps the manufacturer will make the suggested changes."
2,Not as good as expected...,"Most of the reviews I read rated this well. Well, I do not think the antenna picks up like it states. I have tried this in several rooms, AND at my daughters home which is about 20 miles away. The reception in not good.Although in all the other reviews I read I truely believe Location, Location, Location is key.Disapointed."
2,"Didn't Work in Columbus, GA","I tried this product and it received two channels, the same amount as a ""bunny ear"" antenna that had with one broken antenna. I returned this purchase because it wasn't worth the extra expense. I can say the channel came in a little clearer, but there was still plenty of fuzz."
3,Fine for local HD,"The antenna works fine for stations for which signals are good enough. VHF channels are fine though not stellar. For HD channels, it goes blank sometimes but when its working, the quality is good."
2,Not better than the omni directional ones,Bought this item seeing its good reviews. The problem with this unit is that it is very directional. If I do not use plug in the amplifier (yes you need to plug that thing into a socket) the signal through this antenna is poor. Even worse than the $20 simple 2 pole antenna I bought from Sears! With amplification plugged in the signal increases by 20-50%. But directional problem still exists. I'll recommend buying the flat omni directional antenna (flat plate) over this.
5,Wow.. Works great.,"Compared to previous cheap antennas I've purchased, this thing is spectacular. Using it in Austin, TX I pick up all the local channels with a very strong signal."
3,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Reception,"I live in a heavily treed urban planned community just outside Washington, DC, within 15 miles of all 11 local stations. The Terk is not powerful enough to draw digital signals from these stations without regular distortions and dropouts. The signal is also interrupted whenever a plane or weather/police helicopter is in the area and competes with emissions from nearby office buildings.In this environment, I would not recommend the Terk as an alternative to a roof antenna or cable."
3,Good But I Wouldn't Say Great,"I bought this indoor HDTV antenna mistakenly believing that I needed a different antenna to receive HD TV signals. Since then I have found out that ANY TV antenna will pick up HD TV signals. The antenna companies would like you to believe that you need a new antenna to pick up HD TV - it's good for their business if people run out and buy new antenna's. This Terk antenna receives maybe slightly better than my non-amplified magnavox rabbit-ears. That having been said, they do still seem to be well built."
3,Terk Amplified HD Antenna doesn't meet everyone's needs,"The Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified HD Antenna make be an excellent choice for some locations, but it didn't work well in ours. We are about 2 miles from the broadcast antenna, but just below a small hill. We have had problems at times with our HD reception breaking up. So we tried the Terk HDTVa. Unfortunately, despite trying different antenna positions, the antenna proved to be more unreliable than our previous HD indoor antenna - a Phillips SPC030. So the antenna was returned. We have found more reliable reception with the Phillips by placing it high in the room on a shelf. This review is not to say the Terk will not produce fine reception in many locations. It just didn't work for us. Robert Williams"
1,Not for me,"I am an old guy and had ""rabbit ears"" for my tv back when tv came for free through the air. Reading these reviews I was really hoping I could get something like that again. Well no such luck. I get maybe two very fuzzy stations that are spanish and religious which are worthless to me. Cable is just very high now and I can't get satellite the way my apartment faces so this would have been great..........if it worked."
3,Ehhhh... Could be better,"This looks cool, it has a smaller footprint than the last antenna I had. I use to have another highly rated antenna the Winegard SS-3000 which was worse that you needed a lot of space to adjust it and you had even worse reception. I guess that is what is good about the Terk that the space is no problem. You can also take the horizontal antenna part and turn it vertical which gives you even more space.The problem with this antenna is that it barely works. It does pick up the stronger stations but gives me the on and off blocky reception for the not so strong channels and the only way I can get it clear is if I stand by the antenna. Sounds like the aluminum on the rabbit ears technique.Next I try the RCA Ant 1550 since everybody raves about that one. I'm just going to buy it locally from a place that I know will return it if I don't like it."
3,Decent not perfect,"I get good signal but I thought it would be a lot better than my old one that was not powered.. Its pretty much just as good as my old one, which was a cheap one. I get good signal but some Chs and sometimes it goes in and out."
2,a fancy expensive antenna with poor reception,"the antenna has the same reception power than a $20.00 (Radio Shack) antenna that I have before, but now the reception is ok since a adapted them together, I keep it just for the fancy looks but it wouldn't do better than any less expensive antenna."
1,Waste of time and money,This item worked for about a week and then stopped. Tried reconnecting it and cycling power and nothing. It was a complete waste of my time and money.
4,"Good Antenna, but not Magic","I live about 30 miles from the city, and even with this antenna I get a slightly fuzzy signal, but it is cleaner than any other in-house antenna I have tried. At some point I'll probably need to breakdown and install a roof-top antenna. This antenna really does work well, just find out the proper compass direction and point it that way.One little side note. This antenna is not actually amplified; it just comes with a little in-line amplifier. You may get better results if you buy the non-amplified version and buy a higher-end amplifier to boost the single."
1,Not as good as the other reviewers stated.,"I am at DC area. I have more than 10 DTV channels here. My ATI HDTV wonder card is connected to a RCA ant-110($10 from walmart). I can get good reception on Fox5, ABC, NBC. But my favorite WB54 sometimes is not good. I want to get better result, and try this amplified antenna, because so many reviewers give it a good reviews. But I am pretty sad about the result.1. The amplifier is basically useless. Just as other user said, there is nothing different to use it or not.2. The reception is not better than my $10 RCA ant110, if not worse."
2,Same as cheap rabbit ears.,"Works as well as the free rabbit ears that came with my TV set - no better, no less.Don't believe it was worth the extra $$"
1,"Bunny ears are just as good, if not better","I had this product for about a year and was constantly adjusting it. Then, I bought a much less expensive one because this one was just so big and kept tipping over (the plug extends from under the antenna, and it is unstable, both contributing to this big, bulky thing tipping over so much.)I am so much happier to have regular bunny ears, they work better."
2,"Didn't work for Los Angeles, Torrance Area","I live in Torrance, a large city within Los Angeles County. I assumed great results with this, but was disappointed. Grainy and not sharp at all, good thing the return process was smooth with Amazon."
2,HD TV ANTENNA,"I was not very impressed with this antenna, it does not get as good a signal as the cheaper RCA antenna."
4,Works good - a little unwieldy...,"Like the title says, this product works well, but it's bulky and with the antennae extended - it occupies a lot of space. I don't have other HD antennae to compare this one too, but it would be nice to have a more compact version available from Terk."
3,I Can't Wait Til I Move,"All I can say is that this works slightly better than my old crap antenna at picking up over the air TV, which means it works for s--t. I'm just in a lousy location, and the damn government f--ked up over the air TV. It WAS easy to put together and looks kind of cool. Wish my location allowed me better reception than the stuttering pixilation I generally recieve now. UHF better than VHF, by the by."
1,Doesn't work for me,"just bought this antenna yesterday from local store. I live in 3rd floor apt and the broadcast tower is 30 miles away. From the box, this antenna can deliver good signal up to 45 miles from broadcast tower. After install, that promise seems not true. I can only get 1 HD Channel & 1 Analog without the amplification turn on. I had phillips MANT510 and this one absolutely beat HDTVa. my Phillips without amplification still deliver more channels. I can't try the amplifier since it was missing from the box. but, I was expected at least better than phillips. not recommended."
1,NO RECEPTION,"I live in NYC and cable cost is getting ridiculous. I bought the ant...it does not work, no signal, nothing, nada! I tried different configurations etc...nada! Waste of money. Either these positive reviewers are liars, my unit is defective, or there is no signal here."
1,More Hype than anything...,"My $2.00 rabbit ears gives me better reception than this antenna. The only channels this would bring in (no matter how you manipulate it) were the local channels 2-15, which I already get. The ad reads like you are going to bring in channels 2-69...well, not here you aren't. I live high on a hill and the TV is on the second level. The signal tower is no more than 5 miles as the crow flies. So kinda hard to believe what you read. I am returning it today."
1,Bad Reception,I could not get any of the channels. The antenna has to be moved or adjusted for every channel to get a clear reception.
1,BAD RECEPTION....,"THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST ANTENNA I HAVE EVER OWNED, VERY DISAPPOINTED...VERY SPACE CONSUMING, POOR RECEPTION, AND AWFUL CABLE LOCATION, WILL NOT STAND FLAT ON TABLE, WALL OR ANYWHERE..."
1,Danger Antenna : (!,"This Antenna is easily falling off and hitting you. The Reception is not great so you need to move it, but then it falls off easily."
3,no satisfied,i ordered this item as NEW from amazon. plain to see this item had either been used or a demo on display. i just returned a tv/dvd player for the same reason to another seller.
1,J.B. Lee,Terk HDTV is a good product because I did buy a second Terk HDTV antenna that more suited what I was looking for. The design of this particular Terk HDTV antenna did not work for me. It stuck out too far and was located in an area in the bedroom that would have caused anyone coming by to knock it over and it was not strong enough to bring in the local air channels. I live several miles away from the local stations in this area and I needed an antenna that could do both -- be put in a minimal space and work to bring in most or all of the air channels.
3,Ok Antenna,I am not getting all the channels I expected to and it is not as compact as it looks in the picture. There are too long antennas that extend to three feet or so. I am looking in to outdoor antennas and/or amplifing the signal more.My poor reception may result from the area I am in. I have not compared the reception I get from terk with other antennas.
1,An eyesore and doesn't work in small spaces,"I bought this antenna about 2 years ago because I'd decided to go without cable in my new apartment. It may work well for some people, but it has not worked for me. It's very high maintenance, because you need enough room to place it and maneuver the two antenna just right to get the stations. Do yourself a favor and buy the Leaf instead."
2,Leaf Indoor HD antenna,"Item returned. It should have been explained better that if living in a concrete or steel hirise building, the unit would not pick up a signal unless the antenna could be aimed directly at the towers, without any obstructions."
3,IFFY,"I'm the owner of Tech Reviews and Help, and this product is iffy. At the time I bought this product, I lived in a small house and I had my computer set up as a TV. Basically, I hooked up my DirecTV box to my computer and this in it too. It worked, but I later found out this doesn't work as well as some $2 systems."
3,"Reception is good for HD digital TV, not so for SD digital, Why?","This is more like a question than a real review. My experience with this antenna is mixed. It gives very, very good reception for the HD channels in the San Francisco Bay Area, no matter which channel it is. These channels are 2.1 (Fox), 4.1 KRON, 5.1 CBS, 7.1 KGO ABC, 7.2 Live Well, 11.1 NBC etc including two PBC channels and some other HD channels. Sometimes, I have to adjust the direction/position, but this is expected.However, the reception is very, very bad for ordinary, i.e., standard definition, channels like 26, etc. I am wondering what the reasonmight be? I searched everything without getting any clue. So any help would be truly great."
1,Did not work for me,I bought this antenna after the rave reviews I read on this detail page. But I was terribly disappointed with the reception that I got using the antenna. The antenna is highly sensitive to directional changes and the audio/video quality is not as good as some the reviews suggest. I just doesn't Plug n play out of the box and requires a change in direction of different channels.
3,A disappointment,This antenna was a bit of a let down. The reception was terrible and it was kind of big and hard to find a spot for in our living room. We returned this item for a refund.
3,Antenna - sound quality,"Great antenna, maybe the best option I have seen, but I am still having trouble with sound cutting in and out even when the picture is great. May be the signal in my area, but that is all I have to go by."
1,didn't work for me.. very poor reception,it caught the channels very quickly.. the image quality was good.. but reception was really poor.. the image will get stuck after every few seconds.. none of the good channels were caught btw..
2,"Looks Great, But It Doesn't Really Work Well",didn't really work any better than rabbit ears.we're really going backwards in technology when i get pixelation on main network stations and i live in the first line of Dallas suburbs!
5,Great Reception,I get great reception with this antenna. I no longer experience any lost of signal compared to my previous powered antenna. I am very satisfied with this product.
5,A good product at a reasonable price,This indoor HDTV antenna works well in my area (Los Angeles County) I pick up all the HDTV broadcasts and a total of 100 digital channels. I recommend this antenna for users in metro areas.
3,no cable,"Works pretty good for an indoor antenna. Get a lot of channels, but not equally good. It has to be oriented in the right direction, and stations are scattered in many directions, so a little play is required to get desired channels. There is sometimes interference from unknown sources, but overall the reception on my desired channels is reliable. The amplification feature is useless as far as I can determine."
4,Excellent antenna but balky,I recieved the antenna on time. The packaging was very adequate. The installation a snap. I picked 17 channels in my area. My only complaint is that it is bulky. The modern design fit within my furniture.
2,Not better than old-fashioned RCA,"I bought this antenna to improve upon the 3 channels I was getting with a cheap RCA antenna. Now, I'm getting 4 channels but not the two channels I was getting before. Very frustrating. Not worth the $."
1,Pricey Rabbit-ears,Within line of sight of TV transmitters less than 2 miles and could receive hd from only 1 out of 4 major networks. If it works for you great but don't expect much based on my experience.
4,Good antenna,"After a bunch of research I decided on this antenna to grab over the air HD broadcasts. I am pleasantly suprised, especially since many people have said indoor antennas aren't all that great. I'm in an apartment on the opposite side of building as the broadcast towers in my area. When pointed in the direction of the towers the signal is choppy at best, however when it's turned 180 degrees it picks up the reflection off a building on the other side of the courtyard well enough most times. The only time it really stuggles is during overly overcast and rainy days. Right now I have this connected to the built in tuner on my TV (Sharp Aquos LC-42D62U) and it has a much more stable picture than when I had it connected to my HTPC (Hauppauge HVR1600 Tuners) but that could just be because the PC is a little underpowered. Another nice thing about this antenna is the rabbit ears to pick up analog channels as well, it's not really necessary, but a nice addition."
3,Marginal improvement over cheap omni,"This performs marginally better than an omnidirectional antenna that costs about half as much.The house is located about 15 miles from city's antenna ""farm"" and receives terrible analog signals, but gets generally good digital signals, with some occaisional noise. This was bought hoping to improve on the omni antenna's performance, but little benefit was seen."
3,Works ok sometimes,"I purchased a Terk HDTVa and a zenith converter box a few months ago. most of the TV stations are located outside of Tampa Florida about 40 miles away. 2 are located further away. 1 is 12 miles away. It wont pick up the nearest one, but always picks up one a good 60 miles away. Most are UHF and come in clear most of the time. Some get pixelated or just get me blank screens. Some channels just dont come in at all. It seems to largley depend on atmosheric conditions and weather, Also the power and heighth of the transmiting tower. The vhf section is only marginaly usefull as it only has 2 elements. My converter may be part of the problem. I live in a apartment and an outdoor antnna is out of the question. My other TV are connected to the local cable company and recive the hd signals clearly. That my be the answer for those who can't put up oudoor antennas."
5,Great!,"Two of my friends on campus bought this antenna and told me how great it was. I visited both of them and saw how great of quality the picture was on there HDTVs. I personally owning a HDTV wanted to receive HD quality picture, but in a dorm room that is not possible through a cable line. After I bought it and set it up, which was very easy, I was pleased to find out well of a signal it pulls in through the antenna. The picture is crystal clear. You may have to adjust the position of the antenna, but once you find the right position you will know it. The only station over the air I do not receive is NBC because of the dorm room. However, CBS, Fox, and ABC come in very nicely. So, if you are looking for a product that works, go with this Terk Antenna."
2,Not helpful for my TV,"I had high hope for this product because it works fine for my friend and relative. When I installed it in my home however, it did not work for me. I have no ideal why.The seller, Tech-for-Less, was very helpful: they gave me full refund and spared me the trouble of returning the unit."
3,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified Antenna,"Live about 25 miles from the local stations. I can not get good reception on ATF channels (Fox, UPN, WB..etc)at all. UTF Channels are good except CBS. Not sure because I live too far from the stations or not."
4,great antenna,The Terk does bring in signals from 40 miles. I am that far from the stations. It is clear HD. Thanks
1,Don't waste your time or money. It's junk.,"I bought this unit at Best Buy, thinking to replace the ""rabbit ears"" I'm using that give me marginal performance. I followed all the instructions, but this product wasn't even up to the performance of the rabbit ears. Absolutely a no-buy for central Michigan. The rabbit ears are back, and I returned this product for credit."
1,No better than old rabbit ears,I tried it on both the middle and top floor of a three story townhouse. It worked no better than rabbit ears. Their tech support says that in brick houses it should be in the attic or on the roof. Their adds don't mention that.
2,antenna doesn't get all the stations,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV ReceptionI am disappointed that this antenna is no better than the $10.00 one I purchased. It looks good. But I am missing 4 channels I should be able to receive in Chicago.
2,"ok, but not a regular antenna is just as good","I live in Anaheim, CA and the signals for channels 2.1 (CBS) and 11.1 (FOX) are weak. Makes football season difficult to enjoy. Bought this amplified antenna, and it doesn't seem to have made much of a difference over an non-amplified antenna. Feel foolish now for thinking it would solve my problem. I probably need to get a rooftop antenna for decent reception."
3,Not for an NYC Apt. w/o Clear South-Facing View,"This antenna certainly has promise, but we were only able to receive 2 stations (both of them Spanish-language). We're sure that this problem is for the same reason that we can't make use of satellite TV in our apartment: no clear south-facing view. (Like most NYC apartments, ours is obstructed by other buildings at close proximity.) If we did have a clear view, it probably would have worked great."
3,Middling performance,"We live about 35 miles the way the crow flies from transmission towers, without any major tower sight obstacles. The amplified version, which we purchased, is at best marginally acceptable. The major networks can be received but with frequent transmission reception errors, pixeling, frozen screen and the like. Smaller broadcaster cannot be received at all. If you live maybe 20 miles away this product might be worthwhile. Otherwise, a outdoor roof product may be the best choice."
2,Underwhelming,"For all its hi-tech appearance, this antenna performs surprisingly poorly. It was unable to receive some important channels in our area, no matter how it was aimed. I bought the antenna for my daughter, who lives about a mile from me. The antenna performs little better than the VHF/UHF rabbit ears I use on our own second TV. We are less than 20 miles from the transmitters. The antenna is also misrepresented in the ads. It is said to be directional, and it is directional for UHF channels, but the VHF portion is plain vanilla rabbit ears, which are a simple dipole, and thus non-directional. Since the problem here is multi-path interference, as it is in many places, a directional antenna is essential. My daughter had to have an outdoor directional (yagi) antenna installed to get acceptable reception. This antenna, and probably all indoor ""HDTV"" antennas, is greatly overrated, and in my opinion, unsatisfactory."
4,Good antenna. Worth your money.,I live in Avondale just west of Phoenix. I've had this Antenna for 3 days now. I'm using it on a 52' Samsung LCD. Took 5 mins to set up. The antenna is pointing east and is placed elevated above the t.v on the shelf in entertainment nook. Ran the channel scan and got all the local channels in HD + PBS + various others. The reception is solid/stable. Didn't have to mess around too much with it to get a good signal. I'm anywhere between 25 - 30 miles from the t.v stations. Like a lot folks trying to save money I canceled the cable tv. This is the first antenna that I bought and I'm very happy with it. I'm lucky I didn't have to go through 2 or 3 before I found the right one.
5,Great product and easy to use,"Setup and installation was very easy. Once I determined the perfect location to point the antenna, I never had to change it. A ""win-win"" solution for me."
4,"Good product, bad location","Apparently there's nothing wrong with the antenna, it's just that I have to place it in a location where the reception isn't as ideal as I would like. I can't get all the stations and some of the ones that I do get will occasionally break up. I think that if I were able to place the antenna in a better location the antenna would perform ideally."
5,TERK ANTENNA IS SWEET!!!!!,I bought the Terk amplified indoor antenna for my hdtv.Stations from all around Detroit and Canada were received. I was so impressed I am ordering another one. I rank the TERK amplified hdtv antenna 5 STARS! It is better than what I expected.
4,Kimiko,"This is the second one of these I have bought for an additional TV. The antenna works great. Just make sure you shop around on Amazon, because you can find it for a lower price than what I paid on Amazon, and free shipping too. I was in too big of a hurry and just purchased the first one that came up. My mistake."
5,Worked great for me - adding to the positives to help average its performance overall,"Product worked great, I am very happy I purchased it, the reception is fantastic. it is the first antenna i have tried, but for the money, I couldnt imagine a better deal."
1,Added no channels over my non-powered homemade antenna,"I had followed the youtube guide on how to make my own HDTV antenna. I was able to get 2 channels with it, and thought if I bought a powered antenna it would expand my options. Not only did it not expand them, I can't even get the original 2 that I had. It's really as if I don't have an antenna hooked up at all. I've tried multiple placements, directions, and yes, it is on. I know most people on here have good experiences with this but to me, it's absolutely worthless. Now I only hope I can sell it."
4,Terk's antennae works,"The Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified HD Antenna for Off-Air Reception does the job. However, the term ""off-Air"" is not explained. One has to change settings on the TV in order to get it to work. It seems durable but the parts seem to fit to loosely together. Better explanation might be helpful in the manual."
4,Decent antenna for the price,"I bought this same unit a second time for my TV in my room. I had already bought one for my living room TV, and have had no problems with it. The price I paid at Amazon was much cheaper than the first one, which was great! I shopped around the second time I had to buy an antenna and found a much better price!The appearance looks a little ""alien"" like something from Star Trek, but it does bring in the channels quite clearly. Set up was a matter of plugging it in and hooking it to the converter box. Nothing to it.I would recommend this product for the price and reception."
1,Doesn't work,"We started with only four channels on the tv using an old rabbit ear antenna. After adding the Terk antenna we only got two channels. Doesn't work, at least not on our tv."
5,It worked very well,I had low expectations of this antenna but our useless cable provider has no HD converter boxes available so it was worth a try for $36. We live in a high rise in Chicago facing north with another high rise across the street. Terk's website indicated that all the antennas were on the south side.I connected it up and the TV found all of the local channels. I'm all set to watch the Superbowl in HD. Very impressed. Worked much better than expected.
2,Terk HDTVa Indoor HD Antenna,"I am no more than 15 miles from the local TV stations and all stations are south of our house, essentially on the same azimuth. On some of the 4 stations I got good reception at times, while at other times the picture was lost along with the sound. No amount of adjustment solved the reception difficulties.The best acceptable reception I get is by using an amplifier with a $10-$12 Phillips antenna from Wal-Mart. This one is much superior to the more expensive Terk.I will not recommend this product for its purported functions.Bill"
2,Sorely Disappointed,"So after hearing about this antenna from a few folks on the AVS forums, I decided to get one for my buddy up in Birmingham, AL. He gets all of his TV channel Over-The-Air, and he had mentioned losing a few channels after the digital switch over. Now, all he was using was an old pair of ""rabbit ears"" antenna with the UHF ring on it to pick up channels, so I figured that this would be perfect for him. Sadly, I was mistaken. While it looks a fair sight better than the rabbit ears, it doesn't pick up any better than them nor does it get any additional channels back for him. Sadly, I will not be buying this for myself, and I can't recommend it to anyone else for that matter unless you really don't like the look of ""rabbit ears""."
1,Poor Reception,"This antenna failed to receive most of the available channels serving my Arlington, Virginia area, including the one most important to me, PBS station WETA. I replaced it with the RCA ANT1650 antenna which received WETA perfectly, plus many additional stations, altogether about twice as many as the Terk antenna. I also purchased the RCA ANT1650 from Amazon."
2,It'll probably work if you can mount it high,"When it is at floor level, it picked up some channels. If you can mount it little high and your stations are all in one direction and within 30mile radius, it'll prbly work. This one is not easy to mount high. It's designed to stand on a bench. For this reason, I returned this and bought flat model FDTV1a. I am getting all channels (2-9) with FDTV1a and am satisfied - read my review on it."
2,Slightly better than the old Rabbit Ears....,"It doesn't pick up VHF - FOX for me, only 24 miles away! Don't expect anything better than the old ""rabbit ears"" of days gone by."
2,"Doesn't deliver, but probably because of bad signal","I bought this HDTV amplified antenna to replace a regular HDTV antenna because the singal kept getting lost (picture will freeze, or replaced by a black screen with a 'no signal' message). This happened on and off, but sometimes it just happend every 2 minutes, especially if someone was working around in our apartment.This antenna was easy to install but didn't make any difference - the signal quality is still poor. For me, a waste of $40."
3,Passable,Terk HDTVa was larger than expected so it was clumsy to place. It was an improvement over existing antenna but when I used the amplifier in line with the old antenna the results were nearly as good. It gets a passing grade but no raves from me.
2,Not work for my situation,"My living room does not face any TV tower directly so there are only indirect signals.With this antenna, I can only pick up three channels and the quality is OK but not superb. I also bought Philips SDV2940/27 UHF. It can pick up about 15 channels with cable-like HD quality.However, the Philips' is UHF only. It was not designed to pick up VHF signals. In New York area, that means loss of two channels."
3,Underwhelming.,"It may or may not be the fault of the Terk, but it's going back. My old rabbit ears do an equal job of pulling in what channels approach my converter box. Here in Venice, CA, I can no longer receive local channel 2 (except rarely), barely discern channel 9, and neither 11 nor 13. On the plus side, 4.4 and 5.2 arrive fine. Fortunately, I like world championship sports and can tolerate 70s B-movies. UHF is, as always, spotty, with luck on KCET and KOCE.The less expensive Tivax antenna performs about the same as the Terk at my location. I'm keeping the Tivax, just in case I get the time to find exactly the right placement to grab a decent signal.Again, whereas the Terk is no help in my corner of Venice, it may be fine in other locations."
1,Terk HDTV Compared to Rabbit Ear Antenna,"My new digital TV picked up local stations pretty well using an old-style rabbit ear antenna -- but after reading all the reviews about how the Terk HDTV antenna could do so much better, I made the purchase. No real difference! Both performed the same, which means that the rabbit ears are the better deal, as they don't have to be plugged in, and are less obtrusive, and much cheaper. I can't speak for anyone else's circumstance, obviously, but in my neck of the woods, in the Hartford suburbs, the Terk antenna didn't out perform my rabbit ears. My advice would be, if you have an old set of rabbit ears lying around, try them with your digital TV, the reception may surprise you!"
2,not good reception for downtown in the mountains.,"Big let down. So many outstanding reviews I was excited to see what this jewel could do. No better than my old antenna that was designed for analog reception, with enough UHF for receiving PBS. I turned it 360 degrees and found the best direction couldn't even get CBS, let alone... To be fair, I do live in the mountains. Still, this fish cannot fly."
1,HDTVa Antenna,This antenna was not an improvement over my old antenna. The amplification feature added nothing to the reception.
3,TV without cable or satellite,"Easy to set up but very unstable. Best if secured to something. Reception better than Wineguard product, but still have tofiddle with positioning depending on what channel you're trying to view. Truly reminds me of rabbit ears and ghost images back inthe late 50's and early 60's. What a choice - have only 14 channels to watch or pay cable\satellite prices for hundreds of channelsI don't watch."
1,Overpriced. Period!,"In the 1st place, a preamp isn't going to do alot of good with a indoor antenna with a short lead length. It MAY improve things under some circumstances, but more likely it may make things worse.This is one of the ""Silver Sensor"" designs with a cheap 'amp' built in. One can get a Silver Sensor for less than $20. Adding a preamp shouldn't add more than $10 to the cost.Terk, like Monster Cable are two names I avoid like the plague!! It's too bad so many are suckered into their misleading claims (especially Monster Cable)."
4,an okoy antenna,it works okay but not really all that great and seems a little top heavy. needs a way to mount/stabilize.
4,Very nice antenna,"I agree with most of the reviewers that this is a very good antenna, I am getting much better reception then the previous antenna I used, though my experience in HDTV antennas is a bit bare. The only problem is the oft mentioned base, which while it may look sleek and appealing in it's current form, can be a bit of a chore to keep standing upright if placed in a busy area or a flimsy tabletop."
5,great antenna,"Was very easy to set up, had no problems, in order to get the best picture you would have to know where the signal comes, so you have to turn it in different directions, overall very satisfied."
3,"Functions well, but clumsey to use.","All right, it's an antenna with an add on signal amplifier included. It works well, but it takes up LOTS of space, and the base is very tiny, which makes it very top heavy/unstable. I cannot figure out how any engineer would look at this top heavy thing, which only stands up straight on a level surface, and say it was finished. It needs some kind of base to be stable, otherwise it flops over.It does work well, but I don't know if that is because of the design of the antenna, or because it came with a signal amplifier attached."
5,Great antenna,"Wonderful product. I got no channels with a standard antenna. Got this one, and now I get all of the channels available."
4,"Works very well...South Shore,MA","As mentioned in the title this works quite well in my area. I get about 14 channels or so, as well as all the locals in HD. More than my wife and I need, so moving forward after our cable contract expires we will be using this in combination with our streaming netflix only. Looking forward to trimming the fat we don't watch or can get in a myriad of other ways for cheaper/free.To anyone reading this, don't be off-put by the negative reviews. If you live near antennas, give it a try, but understand that it may not be nearly as great an experience as other's have had entirely due to factors outside your control. Worth a shot for $30 though. Maybe you'll end up like the hundreds for which is works very well."
3,Did not work for me,I purchased this antenna to try and get better signal in my basement for a few of my channels. This device did not get any better then the non-amplified indoor terk antenna. This one went back but I am not sure if it is the basement or the antenna so i split the stars and gave it 3.
2,Not good receipt if signal station more than 20-30 miles,"I bought it, my address is in compbell in Bay area, It can't get ABC-7 and KTSF-26's signal."
1,2004 Called and they want their antenna back!,"I bought this because it had the most reviews and the overall ratings were high. I will say this antenna does work well enough but what a monstrosity, big and ugly in your TV room. It has large rabit ears that must be extended in addition to the fins. Later my Dad decided to cut the cord on his satellite tv and just go with over the air HD and I told him to get this model because I had researched it. But he ended up getting one of the much smaller flat antennas and it worked just as well and was unobtrusive. I've since bought the Paper Thin Leaf antenna [...] and it works well for me and is much less conspicuous.Technology improves over time and while this one was probably state of the art in 2004 there are much better newer models that are not so big and gaudy."
5,Easy Setup and Awesome Results,I had been looking to purchase an antenna for one of my spare HDTV's and finally settled on this one from Terk. Setup time was less than 5 minutes. I let my tv auto program the channels that the antenna was picking up. Happy to say that I received crystal clear HD images for all of my locals. Thank you to all of the previous reviews that led my decision to purchase this Terk.
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I saw all the positive reviews and one review stating that it was better than the Leaf (basically the two I narrowed it down to) and I was disappointed after buying the TREK. I'm on the 4th floor (top) of my building in Miami, FL and I have the antenna pointing directly at the towers (about 25 miles away). I only get three channels. I don't get CBS, NBC or anything pertinent except FOX. Pretty much useless.UPDATE: 9/18/2012I bought the LEAF PLUS and it worked a bit better than the Trek. It is WAY more aesthetic though. The trek is too bulky. I used the LEAF at my fathers house as a test and was able to get over 20 channels. At my apartment I only get about ten so take that into consideration on my initial review.In the end, the LEAF PLUS is the winner."
2,Didn't work for me !!,"I tried everything, it just didn't work, I called the Terk Customer service and that doesn't work either, better to buy from a Besy Buy or a Radio Shack, buying online and then do all the returning hassles for a few bucks !! Not worth"
4,Downstairs antenna,"I purchased this antenna because my home is on a hill so the front of the house looks like it is one floor, but on the back it looks like it is two floors. The TV that needed the antenna is downstairs and with the old antenna reception was horrible. This antenna has definitetly improved the reception, however, at times it when people move or walk by, the TV still might loose the channel."
2,Flimsy design,This antenna doesnt stand properly..very unstable...the dipoles broke when the antenna fell on the carpet..and any slight motion breaks the signal strength dramatically. I wouldn't recommend it!
2,"Doesn't work all that well, very space-consuming",I recommend the GE 24727 instead. This antenna didn't give me as good reception and it takes up a lot of space with that alternating metal grid.
3,so close yet so far away...,"this thing gets incredible reception except it is completely cbs blind. no trace of cbs, really too bad, Id recommend it anyway and you will probably have better luck than me."
3,So So,"Nice design, built well but didnt work for me. Tried a converter box with it and only got over seas stations."
1,Weak signal,"This amplified antenna doesn't really work well, even if I put the antenna close to the window where there's nothing covering the area..no trees..etc."
4,one of the better antennaes I've purchased,"The first antenna I purchased was a flat digital indoor model from wallmart that cost around 20 dollars. I would always have to move that antenna from one side of the room to the next in order to pick up certain stations (very frustrating to say the least), but with this antenna I can leave it in one location and pick up all the channels that I couldn't get before or that were either very sketchy. I later purchased a more expensive 80 dollar indoor antenna thinking maybe I'll get more channels. Guess what, I got the exact same channels as I did with this Terk model. Same clarity and everything. A tough lesson to learn is that more expensive is not always better. This is an excellent reasonably priced product."
4,One of the Better Antennas,"I bought this antenna in the hopes that some of the weak signal stations might come in better, and possibly pick up a few stations that my RCA TV top antenna could not. This was slightly better than my RCA. after ""fiddling"" with the position for a half hour or so, I found the best position for it. It did pick up a stronger single than my previous antenna, but no additional ones. I don't blame the antenna though. I think its a good design and does what it says it will. I'm just in a poor reception area."
2,Not the best,"I live downtown of a major city. I'm surrounded by tall buildings and the reception is pretty poor. I purchased the RCA basic rabbit ears antenna a few weeks ago. The reception was ok but I was hoping to do better.After reading the reviews Terk, I decided to give the model a try. Set-up was easy, although the base isn't very stable. After scanning for channels it didn't pick up any extra channels than my rabbit ears. What's worse is that the reception was just about on par with the rabbit ears. Which I guess is fine but the Terk costs 3x as much as the RCA. Go with the basic RCA antenna, no frills but for the price it will give you the same quality reception as this high priced model."
5,Excellent HD Quality !!!,"I am extremely impressed with HD quality of the audio/video that this mighty antenna produces! Worth a switch from Direct TV HD! Works well for my family. Additionally, I subscribed to Hulu Plus for complete previous episodes of shows. For me, it is a PERFECT HARMONY! TERK HDTV amplified antenna + Hulu Plus! Would not rethink of switching back to CABLE or SATELLITE TV ... never ... again. Quality HD TV for LESS!!!"
1,Terk HDTVa indoor Antenna,"disappointed that I had to use the power supply supplied with this antenna to make it pick up channels for my portable 7"" TV. What if I intended to use my tv because of an extended power failure?? I plan to return this item when I have the time."
2,Didn't work well for me.,I bought this last week hopeing to get digital channels for my new flat screen. When it arrived I wasn't expecting it to be so bulky (it looks small in the Amazon pictures). When I tryed it I had to literally hold it against my window to try to get anything. If I put it on a shelf right next to the window no signal came in. I returned this right away.
2,Radio shack antenna is better,This is all looks and doesn't work. It picked up 3 channels vs my $30 radio shack amplified antenna that got 12. Its big and the stand is horrible...it tips over.
4,indoor HDTV antenna,"I get the one HD station available very clearly & when the other stations upgrade this summer I am hoping to receive them as well. Currently, I can receive 3 other stations that are not upgraded yet, but not clearly (formerly with the old arial I could receive only one, but no HD stations.) Considering I am a minimum of 35 miles from any available station I am pleased. I know I would receive more with an exterior arial, however my husband does not want to attach one to the roof and we do no want to have to have to pay for a DISH monthly. I might add that I live in a rural area, in a 2 story home (receiving the HD signal on the first floor) with large trees near me. I am fairly pleased that I can now receive 1 good station!"
4,Terk Indoor Antenna - Best may not be perfect,"I bought this for use in my daughter's apt. with her new HDTV. Her old rabbit ears didn't work at all; neither did the unidirectional antenna I picked up at Home Depot. After doing some internet research on indoor antennas, I settled on this Terk model. It is now hooked up and pointed in the correct direction, which is critical to success for this antenna, and most channels come in crystal clear. Short of a roof mounted antenna, which isn't possible in her apt. bldg., this is an excellent choice. Her best signal strength is pretty poor due to her coastal canyon (Santa Monica) location and most stations still come in decently."
4,good product,"For an indoor antenna, the Terk HDTVa gives excellent reception of the TV stations that are available in the remote rural area in which we live. It is easy to install and use. I bought it to replace an older style rabbit ear with UHF loop antenna and it is so superior to the older one that there is no comparison; like night then day. I recommend this product if you are seeking an indoor antenna."
2,"Good idea, but poor product","I purchased the HDTVa by Terk in order to get HDTV signals on my LCD monitor. It was very easy to set up however, the unit looked absolutely enormous in my apartment. It was such a pain to keep turning it to figure out how to get different channels. Most of the channels had nothing, or the picture would go in and out. I was able to receive 2 channels (ABC and a local city channel) in great clarity but the others were a mess. I am very disappointed with the product and am currently in the process of shipping it back to Amazon...definitely not worth the trouble in my opinion."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","Seems only marginally better than the non-amplified HDTV antenna I was using. Picks up analog signals a little better than the non-amplified antenna (probably thanks to the addition of the 'rabbit ears'). Switching amplification on/off doesn't seem to have much effect. Coax cable is permanently attached to antenna base and routed under the antenna making it somewhat unstable, and is fairly short, making placement difficult, especially if your TV (like mine) is near a wall and you want to extend the rabbit ears. Maybe its my location, but I can't seem to pick up the digital broadcast from my local ABC station (Channel 9 in Kansas City)."
3,old timer,dont buy the amplified terk. i have 2 non amplified and one amplified. there is no difference between the two.
2,disappointment,"I had a passive and cheap antenna. It was working fine except for occasional reception problem (freezing frames etc). I thought if I buy an active antenna these problems would go away. I am not too far from TV towers. I would say 5-10 miles.I read many good reviews about this antenna and decided to buy it. However, it was a big disappointment. As soon as I turned on amplification, the reception went down the drain. Literally, the screen froze up. When I turned off amplification, it was better. But to get the best picture, I even had to take of the power plug. So much for an active antenna... As a result, I decided to return this antenna and stick with my cheap and passive antenna.Not sure what the problem was... Maybe I am too close to the transmission towers and with amplification my TV tuner saturates... Who knows.At any rate, it may be worthwhile trying the antenna, given that so many other people are happy with it. It just did not work me."
3,Not bad,Works ok. I live about 20 mile out from the tower. i get about 6 stations and only 3 come in clear without static.I will be going with an outside one to see if it works better.
4,Solid reception and appealing design,"I got two of these, hoping to get my local channels in HD since my DirecTV receivers are older.Antenna is easy to setup and looks nice. It's not too big so that is dominates the room. Enhancer is a nice feature and it helps. It's probably the best antenna that I have bought.I would have given it 5 stars had I been able to get ABC. That's probably due to my location. But I got pretty much everything else in nice, crisp, clean picture."
2,OK but the RCA Ant525 is much better,"I tried four OTA antennas, including the Terk HDTVa. The Terk worked OK but was very directional and had an unstable base. It was also very big. The OTA antenna I highly recommend in the RCA Ant525. My TV is in the basement and the RCA Ant525 gave me signal strengths of 10-15 points higher than the HDTVa. It's also much smaller and more visually appealing if you aren't able to hide your antenna."
3,not for everyone,"this product can't be measured by me that well, since I live in a crowded area, and it doesn't really get me anything I want... the few channels it gets are good quality, but get choppy and it kills to watch something and miss a few good seconds towards the end..."
1,Indoor HDTV Antenna,"Not nearly as good as I had hoped... Older, cheaper Philips antenna outperforms the Terk. Too bad."
5,good for the fetishist at heart,Those into fetish wear (you know who you are)will appreciate these wonderful condoms. I am in a LTR (16 yrs) so we use them to dress up our toys (and help keep them a little cleaner). On both counts I have to give these condoms high marks.
5,Happy Happy Joy Joy,I ordered these condoms. They came very quickly. I especially like this brand for the way they flare out as you roll them down. It is good for people who feel confined by a conventional condom.
1,"OH, THAT VOICE!!!",SOUNDS LIKE A DRUNKEN OLD LADY AT TEA TIME! {NO OFFENSE TO DRUNKEN OLD LADY VOICES} FLING THIS DISC INTO ORBIT SOMEWHERE...FAST!!!
3,you CAN judge this book by it's cover!!!,"Literally. What you see on the outside cover, is what you'll see on the inside. Great for little kids who love trains, totally boring for parents after the 5th time through... or sooner, depending on your tolerance.The book literally has pictures of trains with their name or type written below. It is cool to see the different types and such, but there's not really anything to read. We utilized this book to work on our son's memory and assigning names to objects. It took some time, but he began to associate trains on one page with others like them on other pages, so it got some good use that way.Otherwise, it became a favorite book for him and a favorite DISLIKE for us to read -- because there's nothing to read!!!So, great for hte kids a bit boring for the reader!Sometimes, YOU CAN judge a book by it's cover!"
2,Cow catcher is gory,The book is great except for the photo of the train with a cow pusher that has blood on it that is featured repeatedly.
1,Preposterous,"The two stars of this glossy-looking movie, based on a novel by bestselling Peruvian author Jaime Bayly, are two popular Latin American soap opera stars. Suffice to say that the characters they have played in their most popular soaps are more credible, entertaining and nuanced than the ones they play in this movie about the affair between a sexually unsatisfied woman and her artsy brother in law. The three wealthy lead characters are good-looking, but unsympathetic, so you don't care what happens to them. And the final resolution is a machista fantasy. I suggest you skip this and get ""Rubi"", Barbara Mori's most famous soap opera instead. It's more fun, you get to see more of her, and you'll get more emotionally involved that watching this movie."
3,Excellent movie,"This is one of the best Latin American movies I have seen. Yes, it is a bit too telenovela-like; but, it is good. Barbara Mori plays a woman in a miserable marriage. Her husband is emotionally distant, never really wants to have sex with her and is hiding a secret. She looks for a bit of love and fun in her husband's brother, who only wants to have fun and live the irresponsible, no-strings-attached lifestyle. Add to all of this all the cultural and morality issues present in Latin American society and you have a great exploration of a society that although progressing in economy, culturally, technologically, still has to deal with the deep-rooted and long-held moral beliefs.The movie has all the emotional and dramatic whirlwind of a telenovela but will all the good acting these fine actors have to offer. What comes out is a very engaging and interesting film and is definitely worth watching."
4,Barbra Mori,I brought this dvd because I could'nt find it for download. I've seen this movie before and loved it. Buying a movie so I could watch Barbra Mori was well woth it.
4,La Mujer de Mi Hermano (dvd),"This is a great movie and would be 5 star if it had English subtitles!!I saw the movie on one of the movie channels, but of course, it was subtitled!This movie states on the cover and in the info that is has subtitles in twodifferent languages, but it does not.This is a wonderful movie if you are fluent in Spanish!!"
4,Great Movie,"I'm a big movie guy, and this movie is great really good acting and great story. I would recommend buying it."
2,Dopey,"The most tedious and predictable tripe, this film tosses a few ""themes"" around, but does nothing with them. Because it hasn't a brain in its head. Who knows if what the brother says is true, and ultimately, who cares? These are the poster children for the contemporary world, where ""I want"", ""I need"", ""I take"", and it's every man, and woman, and child, for themselves. I'd rather not live among them, talk to them, or watch them. An utterly indifferent film, one that dragged on interminably with lots of soft focus coupling that only served to demonstrate just how little this vapid bore had going for it."
2,Not Well Made,"Some good actors were cast for this, but the film is flat. The dialogue has a very soap opera feel to it, and the makers of this did not succeed in making any of the characters out to be worthy of sympathy in the least bit. They took an idea that had potential and did nothing with it.I would suggest passing on this as I found it to be dull, shallow, and obvious."
2,Why do they keep coming?,"The re-make CDs keep coming, they are everywhere on the internet sites. It's lucky that the basic music stores in my area don't carry these, instead carrying discs of the far more enjoyable Decca songs. Once again it's the Mexican recordings. But ""Land of a 1000 Dances"" is interesting complete with Big Joe Turner announcing: ""Ladies and gentlemen --- here he is --- Mr. Go Go --- Beel Haley -- and his Comets, let 'em roll!"" That's enough to keep this budget-line disc entertaining."
5,Thomas guide rocks!,"You cannot go wrong w/ Thomas Guide! I seldom use it, but when I need to, it has not let me down yet!"
2,Back Off Customer-a-loo!!!,"Dear fellow customers. DON'T ORDER THIS ALBUM!!! Donna is light years beyond the quality of this recording. It has been released in so many forms that someone will soon make the mistake of re-releasing it in its original form....thinking of course it's new! UGH!!!Let it go...for those record companies thinking that you can make a buck on Donna's success and fame, I have one thing to say.... DON'T DO IT ANYMORE!!! We don't want to see this release ever again!!!!!! We have it! -Been there, done that; bought, designed, handpainted the t-shirt (and matching coffee mug) and are OVER IT!!! (There, I feel better!) -Doug-a-loo!"
1,It's a Ripoff - - Stay away from this CD!,"This collection is a very low budget attempt to make money from Donna's fame and success. It is a very poorly produced excuse for a CD. I bought mine under the title ""Nice To See You"" in a clearance bin for a few dollars and still feel ripped off. All joking aside, please PLEASE do not waste your money on this. Purchase one of Donna's real albums instead!!"
1,Even Donna doesn't acknowledge this one!,"All the previous reviews are correct - this is a bum album. The production values are nil, and Donna can barely be heard above the muffled backup singers. It's been released under several different titles, not one of them any better than the other. Even hardcore fans of Donna's have a tough time appreciating this one."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Save Your Money. Donna Summer is NOT featured on any of these tracks!This is a bad attempt to cash in on the legendary Donna Summer.When looking for her music please google ""search"" for a Donna Summner Discography.The ones linted are ones you want to purchase.Amazon needs to pull these releases."
3,review on the way!,"just ordered this puppy and will hook it up, try it out, kick out some Anthrax triple beats, and review it!"
1,poor,"This product must have been old because it was never useable andwould never come out of the tube, this batch was really not good"
2,"great product, bad can design",the right stuff is by far my favorite type or RTV-ish material. this particular can just sucks though. the tip breaks off easily and i literally had a can of it do the shooting snake and unload everything inside directly on to my work bench after apparently pressing too hard. if you're reading this do yourself a favor and buy the caulking gun style version.
2,terrible blade,"The blade is very very heavy, and is terribly connected to the sheathe, i accidnentally sat on the large pole in the bed and the blade bent from the hilt like butter."
4,Great book for older kids,"My five year old niece loves this book, even though she doesn't get most of the jokes (and doesn't even realize that they *are* jokes, in fact).This is a book chock-full of what are, frankly, horrific puns. The storyline is about how the alphabet travels to find treasure, but it's definitely not an abecedarian. It will not teach your child his or her letters. It's just silly fun.Do note that it's a longer book (as picture books go), and that many of the jokes will sail right over the head of younger readers (""We sure spent our times roamin'"" springs to mind).As a book for older kids or adults, though, it's completely indispensible. (I read it a lot to myself as the kids nap!)"
5,Sheisty To Da Bone!!!!!!Baby!!!!!,"This Book Was Given To Me, By A Close Friend.I Throught That The Author Did An Excellent Job With This Book To Me personally.I Loved This Book From Start To Finish. I Was Really Taken By The Ending Of It. Am Waiting On Part 2..There Are Many Unanswered Questions, That Am very Curious About. There Nothing ""SHEISTY""About T.N.Baker.This Book ""Aint Nothing But Da Truth Ruth!!!!"
4,Wide Open!,"Can't wait for part 2, what's taking so long?! Please hurry up. I'm like a fein I need to know what's gonna happen next."
5,Sheisty,This book is a good book to read for enjoyment. If you like books about how it really is in the Drug world this book is just for you. It helps you value friendships and relationship. I hope part II is just as good.
3,Waste of my time.,"I hate books that are to-be-continued, and if u do too, this is not the book for you. It is basically boring until the end, when all the ""drama"" goes down, then you have to pay another 15 dollars or more just to find out what happened. I expected better, and maybe after the reading the sequel i'll like it, but until then. i think it was a waste..."
3,Just Aight,The book was aight. I ain't like the way homegirl let the end go. This book ain't gangsta but the ladies will still like it.
5,The things b*tches do for money,This book was very good but short. Not that short but short enough for me. But i enjoyed every bit of it. This book is a page tunner added to my book collection.Main CharactersKeisha- You shouldn't of did what you did. I wouldn't stoop that low now look at you -- your in a jamEpinphany- Girl your pretty there's gotta be another way. Now look at you ... you should of left that nigga alone a long time ago.Shana- That dike-ness gonna catch up to you one of these days and KC is not gonna like itSHEISTY PART 2 HERE I COME!!!!!!!
3,An ok read,"I read this book in one day,this is one of them books thats not good or bad you just can't stop reading it and don't want it to end. You can relate to some of the girls situations and see them growing up in your neigborhood."
4,A good read,I read this book in about one day. It was a pretty good book. It kept my interest plus I defintely want to get part two to find out what happened. The book reminds of you what really happens in the hood. It wasn't unbelievable at all but the cold-hearted truth.
1,Inspiration,"This book has inspired me! I am going to write!If this book can be published and has absolute nothing to talk about... I know I can come up with some thing to keep readers glued to the pages. Please do not buy this book. It is not worth it. I finished it last night and I don't really remember what it was about. The only interest I had in this novel was the main character name Epiphany (interesting name). The book was based on a lot of drama, lies, and ghetto girls looking for money.I can write about that!"
1,Does anyone have this book?,Being as though I have been trying to find this book for awhile now I'm hoping that it's coming out in mass production soon. (finger crossed). I bought Still Shiesty from a Borders that recently closed where I lived for 60% off thinking I could get the first one here. I guess thats not happening anytime soon. :(
2,PLEASE!!!!,"I'll keep this one short and simple. This book has no character development, didn't capture me at all and was pretty boring. T.N, work a little harder on your novels to come. I gave you two stars for making an effort...but ya book was not appealing to me. Sorry..."
4,WHATS REALLY GOOD,"FIRST OF ALL I WANNA START BY SAYING IT WAS A PRETTY DECENT BOOK FOR WHAT IT WAS WORTH. BUT THE LINES IN THE BOOK WERE SO BIG THE BOOK IS 250 PAGES LONG AND IF THEY WOULD HAVE MADE THE LINES CLOSER, IT COULD OF BEEN ALL OF 170 PAGES LONG. BUT THE REASON IT KEPT MY ATTENTION IS CAUSE IT WAS TOLD BY MORE THAN ONE PERSON NOT JUST ONE POINT OF VIEW. ONE THING I RECOMMEND FOR THE AUTHORS ID TO READ OVER UR MATERIAL MORE THAN ONCE CAUSE THE TYPOS START TO GET REAL ANNOYING. OTHER THAN THAT THE BOOK WAS THE SHHHHHHHHHHHHH....... I AM DEFINITELY WAITING ON THE SEQUEL CAUSE MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, ITLL BE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE FIRST."
4,Too Sheisty,"Another book about gold digging man hungry getto girls! The last couple of books I have read has been about these type of girls. What about the men? Please all you women authors out there you and I know that there are plenty of men who are gold digging women hungry players out there, and who better to write about them than a women who knows. So let's here about them for a change.Well I read this book in one day, the girls Epiphany, Keisha and Shana are really sheisty people. They are suppose to be best friends but frankly who needs emenies when you have sheisty friends like these! T.N. Baker this is not bad for your first book, lots of typo's and so on but Iam sure you will get it together before sheisty 2 comes out."
2,this book was the bomb but can you get an editor?,"I loved this book. And I promise I will buy anything T.N. Baker puts out but sister can you get somebody to edit your work. What is up with that? If Triple Crown won't edit your work then give Terri Woods a call or Carl Weber for that matter. Please, please, you have so much talent but it is wasted because of poor editing.5stars for content.negitive 3 stars for editing."
4,"Finished the book, anticipating the sequel","This book was pretty good. Drama filled, but good nonetheless. Couldn't wait for the sequel! The sequel is poorly edited but a great follow up to this story."
5,couldn't put the book down,"T.N Baker has really outdone herself with this book.From page one I knew that this book would be a real page turner.Sheisty tells the story of three friends who grew up together but somehow managed to grow apart as they got older. Sometimes people do stay the same while others manage to grow and thats what happened between Shana, Epiphany and Keisha.As i read this book I couldn't help but relate to the situation of these three girls.But overall this is one of the best books that i have read in a long time, very well written!!!"
3,Not the best but pretty good,this is a pretty cool figure of shelton benjamin he has on his blue trunks he also comes with elbow pads and knee pads he has on blue boots with silver on them. his head is also shaved
5,"Fun, starter kit with myriads of possibilities","I gave this to a 4 year old who is precociously mechanically-minded. She was able to look at the idea booklet with the Zoob kit and construct a foot-long man by herself. The pieces are large, each one is about 2"" long and they're easy to snap together.For a child this young, adult assistance is probably necessary to help them build some of the more complex creations in the idea book. But for the recommended age group, it's probably a great toy for them to play with unassisted.There are kits with more pieces in them, but my friend said that there were enough possibilities with this smaller kit to keep his daughter entertained for a long time. I will purchase these for the other children in my life since these construction sets are great for stimulating their mechanical and analytical sides, fine motor skills, imagination, and creativity."
3,a toy to grow into,This is a great toy in spurts. My son plays with it for a week at a time and then switches back to legos. It is a great toy overall.
5,"If you liked The Mysterious Voices of Bulgaria,","you'll love this CD. All of the power is there, the polyphonic surges, the phrasing, the harmonies, plus there is the unpresidented JOY of the Iles Tropiques. One can almost hear the pounding surf and the shouts of recognition as the fishing boats come onshore.This music will set you grinning from ear to ear."
1,Book Report not a book,"The only content to this ""book"" is the reference to other authors and writings. Even that is done in a high school level book report style. Don't waste your time or money."
2,This book has a really great title.,"If you think L. Ron Hubbard is a reliable scholarly reference, you may appreciate this author's common sense ""201 ways to identify and deal with toxic personalities"". Large print. Small pages. Highly derivative. Unoriginal. Not something that will have a permanent place on my bookshelf."
2,Too over the top.,"I understand that we should notice bad things about toxic people, but no one is perfect. This book goes beyond logic, into what seems like a silly rant about behaviors that practically anyone can exhibit on a bad day.Too over the top, and in laymans terms for me. I honestly regret this purchase. It's a bit cheesy to me, and written in a style that subtly smells of romance novel penmanship."
4,great for swimmers/divers,I had no issues with this product. it is great for those who are active in aquatic sports or work often in the pool.
1,Be careful !!!!,"I bought these for exercise class much to my regret. If you think that this is like the Speedo Chamois towel or others like it on the market, it is not. The towels were wet with some sort of liquid when I received them. On first washing, they dried as stiff as cardboard. I contacted Recreation Supply Company and they said that they contacted the manufacturer and were told the towels should be stored wet. This is an unbelievable response. I can't imagine the microbes on a wet towel stored in a tube for any period of time. The Speedo towel dries soft and is super absorbant. Not so these. Unfortunately, I bout about 5 thinking they would be like the Speedo. STAY AWAY!"
4,P.O. Super Game Hauler Review,"After purchasing the Pacific Outdoors Super Game Hauler, I was very impressed at its strength and versatility. The hauler has come in handy for taking game from out of the woods as well as moving heavy items around the yard. I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a deal on a hauler."
1,Whatever you do please do not buy this album,"I guarantee you will regret it. Honestly this is one of the only times I've actually been MAD at the person who made an album, and it's because these guys ""The Picks"" recorded their own terrible overdubs onto the album just so they could make some money! Ugh.They make the music worse, and if you want real Buddy Holly recordings then go with another collection besides this without The Picks. Like this:Buddy Holly GoldTrust me. At the end of the day Buddy Holly was a legend and he deserved better."
1,Still Picky after all these years . . .,"Collectors of Holly's works will know all about the Picks' saturation of the on-line market place with their often misleadingly-titled releases. If I am ever unfortunate enough to purchase any of this junk in error - simply because the merchandise description did not disclose that it was a Pick's ""retro-dub"" - I make a point of registering my displeasure when I leave feedback for the seller. Sellers should know what they're selling & describe it fully & accurately to their potential buyers; anything less is unacceptable.Another thing; why use artwork / images that aren't even of Holly? Unfortunately, this cheapskate practice is becoming all too common."
1,WHAT AN INSULT TO THE CRICKETS,"This album cover shows Buddy Holly with his band ""The Crickets"" but...For some incomprehensible reason, around 1985-90 someone in authority gave license to a group called the Picks to overdub any and all original Buddy Holly recordings with their vocal harmonies.These modern overdubs of Holly's 1950s classics deface his finest work, and are widely distributed as ""Buddy Holly and the Picks"".As result, there are surely a lot of people out there who think Holly's band was the Picks, and that Holly and the Picks were not very good (they're not).Buddy Holly was an exceptional artist. Treat yourself to the real thing."
3,Comprehensive but lacking and error filled...,"Let me start off with what is great about the book. It's very detailed in regards to characters, weapons, force powers, and pretty much almost everything else. If you want to know all about the game and all of it's aspects, this is the book to add to your collection.On to the bad stuff. If you are looking for an actual WALKTHROUGH, you will be sorely disappointed. I found it extrememly hard to follow although the maps were accurate, readers who tend to follow written directions as opposed to map viewing will tend to get lost quite a bit. The console cheats are also not that accurate and complete.In short, if you want detailed general information about the game (or if you just love SW in general), get the book. If you are looking for a complete and more detailed walkthrough, you're better off getting one for free off the net."
1,What a waste of money.,"The author of this Guide better keep his day job.A guide is supposed to help you get through difficultparts of the game, this leaves them out.I wish another mfr made a stratgey guide.Save your money DO NOT buy this game, it won't help you."
1,YOU MUST BE KIDDING!!!!!!!,What's with the $$$$$? These were really good pizza crusts even though there was a shelf life issue...if you aren't gonna offer them...TAKE THEM OFF your item list...listing these for such crazy prices makes this look like spam rather than a product offered by Amazon.
4,Something unexpected,"The item itself is a great collection item. It's very stable and durable. Now, the sword its supposed to enter in the middle of both dragons. One of the placements had a bigger diameter than the other hole making the Katana unstable and unalign. I had to put a piece of wood to make it fit. I don't complaint about the item itself but in the end did not like it..."
4,3.5 stars . I liked it!,"I liked this book. I loved the fact that it was unique in making the hero a kept man. It was enjoyable to read how it played out. The chemistry between the hero and heroine was great and their banter was fun to watch. The hero and the heroine had such a great conection that it made the love scenes extremely hot! Most of the book was engaging but getting closer to the end it lost some of it's appeal. The plot started to spiral out of control, and it seemed like some things were resolved too easily, while other things were just thrown in to take up precious pages that could have been used to add more substance, but since the beginning and the middle kept me turning the pages with anticipation, it was worth the time and money spent."
3,A GOOD READ THAT SHOWS POTENTIAL,"The novel has all the elements that I look for in a good romance: a masculine handsome hero that is also sensitive and has a tortured past; an intelligent, thinking heroine that is loving and also beautiful; an engaging plot that keeps the reader involved in the story. The ""bad"" characters are one dimensional, Ms. George would do better if she developed them in some shades of gray instead of only unredeeming black. However, the dialogue is just too unrealistic when dealing with sexual matters. I can't imagine most people, even in the 21st century, speaking with close friends, let alone virtual strangers, using the vocabulary or the graphic descriptions that the protagonists use. A little more subtlety in the language would not make the novel unsexy, but would make it more romantic."
4,Excellent but edited book,"I simply wanted to point out something quite curious I discovered in regards to old game collections published in the US: they normally were edited versions of the original, abridged versions if you will, here for example a previous reviewer says that the book contains a total of 80 games, well my copy in Spanish language has 105 games, something similar happens with the Botvinnik's games collections (take for example the 1972 edition by McKay), the versions published in English not only has less games but also the notes themselves were shortened by the publisher without mentioning that important fact to the reader. I think this probably was a common practice in the 70s which is a shame so, be aware, this book does not contain the total amount of games as in the original an also the annotations might have been ""censored"" for the sake of reducing the number of pages."
1,leaky,"We have two ready beds and both sprung a leak after 2nd use-tried to contact the company for replacement mattress and no response. We were not rough with thw mattress it is just very poor quality. the bedding/sleeping bag attached is nice and fairly durable,just the plastic mattress is very poor quality"
1,Not durable,The air mattress sprung several leaks in 3 months. It was only used 3 times. I've tried contacting the Mfg. and can't get them to respond back. I'd be willing to purchase another mattres from them since other store bought ones don't fit. My daughter loves this bed and it was convienent for overnight stays. I'm not willing to go ahead and purchase another whole one when we only got 3 uses out of it.
3,"Great Concept, Low Quality",We bought ready beds for our 2 and 4 year olds. The concept is great. They really enjoy them when we go camping. The sleeping bag material is very cheap and started ripping on day one. The air matress pump is extremely slow and cumbersome to use.
1,Don't buy it!,"I got this bed for when I sleep over at my Grandma's, and it is as hard as a rock! I usually can sleep anywhere but could not sleep at all on this! even the floor was more comfertable. It is not very warm either. So if you are going to buy a sleeping bag, dont buy this."
1,Mother of an active sleeper,I bought this for my 4-year old daughter for sleep-overs at Grandma's house and vacations. It was a real disappointment. The pillow part was very uncomfortable - my daughter didn't know where to put her head. At least 3 times each night I had to put my daughter back into her bed after rolling out of it. I'm going to return it and spring for the more expensive Aero bed.
1,If only magic were strong enough to refund me my 6 dollars.,"Wow- this book lacks virtually everything that would make it a good story. In fact, it is ungood. The absence of good.Ever read those Sweet Valley High books when you were a kid? Well, if you still like reading those books then Stronger Than Magic may be just the thing for you.I am at such a loss as to how other readers rated this so high. Am I the brunt of some kind of online joke? Is there a camera filming me?I won't perpetuate the cycle of untruth here- This book was written for 14 year olds, by a a 14 year old. The characters are flat, one-dimensional, and not especially interesting. The writing is trite, juvenile, and there's never anything gripping or emotional in goody goody what's her face being able to teach cardboard cutout Mr. Emotionally Dead how to love again. She does it through being the super good, sexually innocent, super pretty thing she is. Hoorah! How fun! Only it's not."
2,not impressed,"I read his other books, SEAL Team One, Silent Descent and Pressure Point and this one just doesn't cut it - I couldn't finish reading it because as another reviewer wrote, there just wasn't much action. Lots of buildup but it just didn't carry it for me. If I didn't know it was written by a former SEAL and CIA guy I wouldn't of thought it believeable, ie, that the US govt would secretly enlist a Ross Perot type to take out some terrorists using Ghurkas.I can say that if you want a good read from Dick Couch, then a must have is The Warrior Elite, about SEAL training. I give that one 6 out of 5 stars!"
3,Couch Potato,"I bought the book based on reading Mr.Couch's previous works. But this was a bit overly contrived. And to be an ""Action-thriller"", shouldn't the emphasis be on action, not political drudgery. And ""dropping the hammer"" on a Glock?!, or placing one on safe?, I suppose minor technical details. An entertaining read for a cold winter night, but not up to Mr.Couch's standards."
5,Exciting Book!,"After his son is killed in the 9-11 attacks Joe Simpson,awealthy industrialist decides to take action.He forms the Intervention Force (IFOR).This organization has no governmentties.The American President decides to build a pipeline across Afghanistan.A Saudi Prince wants to halt this project because itwill threaten the power of the Saudi oil industry.He hires former KGB terror master Pavel Zelinkow.Zelinkow arranges for two nuclear bombs to be stolen from Pakistan.One of these bombswill be detonated on the pipeline.His purpose for the second bomb is known only to Zelinkow and his terror associates.American Special Forces cannot be used against the terrorists hiding in Iran.The American President is forced to call upon the Forces of Joe Simpson.IFOR is called upon to handle the assigment.Led by Steven Fagan,Garrett Walker,Janet Briscoe andbacked up by other team members IFOR sets out to stop the forcesof evil before it is too late.An exciting read that you will enjoy."
4,What the energy crisis is about and what to expect,"Over the Barrel presents the world energy situation---past,present, and future, in very readable, logical terms. Being a housewife with no connections to the energy industry, my eyes were opened to the critical status of our oil supply, and the complications and expense of the alternatives."
5,Refreshing to hear after so many years!!,"After not hearing Fountains for 15 plus years, I was grinning from ear to ear when I finally found this CD, bought it and once again heard those fresh crisp sounds that still sound great today. All same tracks as album. A must buy for Starcastle fans and for those Yes, Genesis, etc. fans, this CD is a must listen. Includes liner notes and lyrics in English and Japanese."
1,the songs are weak,"sorry but they are and boy did i waste some money i thought since ""Narada Piano Solo's"" was such an unbelievably strong book that this one would at least be half as good but nah - i found only one or two songs even remotely interesting and nothing i care to spend much time with - i shelved this book the first day - oh well no biggie - thats my opinion as former pro touring musician and current piano composer"
3,I like it.,"El dispositivo esta bien, lo estoy probando y sigue funcionando a cabalidad. No tengo quejas de este dispositivo. All right.!."
5,le cercle rouge,The red circle is entertaining on a dramatic thriller level. The action entails purposefully and the cinematography is much on the level of the artistic. The main situation is cerebral rather than theme park speeded. The story is very enticing and pulls you in.
4,BUDDHIST NOIR?,"""When men, even unknowingly, are to meet one day, whatever their diverging paths, they will inevitably come together in the red circle.""I have no idea what the Buddha quote in the film's title sequence really means, but Jean-Pierre Melville's LE CERCLE ROUGE (Criterion) is a superb, cool, meticulous, existential (Buddhist?) masterpiece of crime cinema about a tight-lipped thief (Alain Delon) and an escaped prisoner (Gian Maria Volonte) who fatefully cross paths (predestination?) and join a fallen ex-cop (Yves Montand) to pull off a dangerous jewel heist -- all the time relentlessly pursued by an driven police inspector (André Bourvil).This great looking director's cut restores 40 minutes and features tons of extras."
4,a great crime drama,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""Le cercle rouge"" (The Red Circle) is a really known film in France, but less famous internationally.In the film, an ex-con returns to his old ways and meets up with a prisoner who jas just made a daring escape from police custody while being transferred to another prison.The film has some excellent scenes typical of such a movie and includes some nice cinematography.The special features on the DVD are quite impressive also.All of the special features are on disc 2 they are:Two theatrical trailers. the original and a re-release trailer. a photo gallery with publicity shots amd lobby cards. A half hour of on-set footage with interviews of selected cast & crew. There is also a set of interviews with Rui Nogueira and Bernard Stora, Finally tre is a set of excerpts of "" Cinéastes de notres temps: Jean-Pierre Melville"" a biographical film about the director."
2,Another slow euro film.,Slow euro film that just hardly gets going. Each scene is about 3 times what an American film would have. Most euro films are not this slow. Had to force myself to sit and watch.Great photography!
2,surprisingly bad,I bought this DVD because it was a supposed to be a classic and found myself wondering about the judgement of such a purchase. Not only did it drag from the beginning but I failed to ever find what it was that allowed others to recommend it. I was glad when it ended and will be more circumspect in future selections.
3,Objectives out of date,"Make sure you look at the exam objectives on the LPI site. The chapters that the book tells you to study for the first exam do not match what is on the actual exam. Subjects on exam 1 but not named in the book as being on exam 1 were hardware, installation, package management, and X."
3,wlassiter,"This book is useful for reviewing and/or referencing but do not believe this book will get you past exam 101.First, it does not stress rpm package installation; commands and options/switches. This book puts the latter with exam 102; WRONG!Second, it does not provide all the detailed information required to pass, such as scenarios and X installation.Finally, I suggest studying from the lpic website's detailed objective list.Good luck everyone....Slackware rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The best of the bunch...,"This book is somewhere between a test prep and a linux manual...The beauty of the LPI certification is that it is new, making ""test prep"" books hard to compile. What this book does is present the information required in the LPI exam objectives in a realistic order... not in a 101 and 102 section.While this seems to have upset some people, if one stops and thinks about the presentation it makes sense to keep like topics together to LEARN the topic, not to seperate into two sections of a book dependant information (thus teaching the TEST)This book carefully presents the reader with all the information he/she will require to pass the LPI Level I exams (101 & 102)"
4,Be carefull using this book for certification,"This book is exellent for those who want to certify.One big fat NOTE:Do not use the training plan for each exam , that's in the book.Go to www.lpi.org for detailed requirements. Also read online (HOW-TO's) while preparing. Although the book is really good for preparation, things have changed in the meanwhile.."
2,Lost in translation,"I am a big fan of African music and am always excited when I come across someone who comes highly lauded. So I was looking forward to Khadja Nin's ""Ya"" album.Well, it surely didn't strike a chord with me. This being her first US release she made the big mistake to try to appeal to Western tastes (see the Sade and Sting comparisons that have been made in other reviews), regrettably sacrificing her Burundi musical roots.It's an okay album but after listening to it this once, I certainly didn't feel to compel to listen to it again. Ever."
5,Never let me down!,"I've used few Addonic's products and none of them turns me down! I got the card, slided it in the slot, and it worked almost instantly (IBM ThinkPad and WinXP pro), no driver needed. The speed is up to max 480Mbps. No external power needed for mouse, webcam and external CD burner, even I plug them in together... those I have tried so far. The adaptor for external supply comes in the box though, I don't think you need it anyway.What I really like is its size, I've been looking for few cards in the store and seems like Addonics is the slimmest among those no-power-need 2-port cardbuses. What else can I say? It is really great for the price. I love it!!"
1,Didn't work,This device didn't work with my HP laptop running XP. It destabilized the system and I had to return the product.
2,Addonics CardBus USB 2.0 Adapter,"This solution did not work for me. I have a Dell Inspiron 8200 which has 2 slots. One of the slots is being used for my wireless card. With both cards in, my wireless card quits working. I cant really review the product since it is not a suitable solution for my use."
1,Didn't work for me,Could not get the card to work trying several times to install drivers etc.My Dell Inspiron laptop running XP did not recognnize the card when plugged into the card slot.Returned it
3,Just OK,"After I read some reviews from others, I bought it by myself one. As soon as I put the card bus, the windows recognize the new hardware and I don't even need to install the software. It works well in my computer with Win xp, but some times my computer just shut down itself once in awhile since I installed this card bus. Please be careful before you bought this, and make sure you read the review from others."
3,Waste of Money,"I bought Addonics CardBus USB 2.0 Adapter so that I can maximize the speed of my USB 2.0 flash drive, especially when I make presentations during travels. Unfortunately, my USB flash drive works only with Addonics CardBus if the power supply is plugged in. It is cumbersome to be travelling around with the power supply. Other than this limitation, the card works okey.Vel"
4,"Works well, but needs bulky power adapter.","Smooth installation on my Toshiba Satellite 5005-S504 and works well. The bulky power adapter doesn't travel well, but is necessary for proper operation. If you need to add USB 2.0 to an older laptop, this does the trick."
1,Not Good,"This book was not good. Nothing happened, nothing was explained, by the end I was just reading every other line to get through. I had to finish it because I had already invested so much time in it. If you are going to start reading Star Wars, start with something else. Something by Timothy Zahn, James Luceno, or Troy Denning. Not this.By the way---where is the character development?"
2,Weak and Weird,"Greg Bear is someone that I respect, but this novel read like an attempt to make Star Wars into hard Sci-fi. I normally write reviews that are paragraphs in nature but the following is the best way to describe this book.Did Bear do a good job? YesIs this an interesting book? Yes, somewhat.Does it feel like Star Wars? No, not even close.Does it do much to expand the Star Wars world? Not really.Does it have any redeeming qualities? Yes, It gives an explination as to why Qui-Gon didn't fade away in EP 1, and they build a cool ship with neat technology.Would I read it if I weren't a Star Wars Geek? Probably NOT!"
2,Not as good as I had hoped...,"This book was definately not as good as I had hoped. The characters were all right , but the author didn't depict them very well. Especialy Obi-wan. The author portrays him as a stuffy, always neutral, never cheerful, and well, a boring person. He's not like that. He DOES have a sense of humor you know! I also didn't like the chapters about Raith & Tarkin. It was all boring talk. Looking for action? Keep on looking. Unless your a die-hard-must-read-every-book fan this book may not be for you..."
2,STAR WARS AS HARD-CORE SCI-FI?!?,"THIS BOOK GETS OFF TO A GOOD BEGINNING WITH ANAKIN TRYING TO RECAPTURE THE SPIRIT OF PODRACING IN THE TRASH TUNNELS OF CORUSCANT, HOWEVER IT QUICKLY DEGENERATES INTO A HARD TO FOLLOW, DIFFICULT TO SLOG THROUGH DESCRIPTION OF A WORLD WHERE FABULOUS SPACE CRAFT ARE ORGANICALLY GROWN TO SPECIFICALLY MATCH THE OWNER.THERE ARE A COUPLE OF INTERESTING FORESHADOWS FOR ANAKIN AND AN APPEARANCE BY THE FUTURE GRAND MOFF TARKIN, BUT THESE ARE THE ONLY WORTHWHILE PORTIONS OF THE BOOK.QUITE FRANKLY, YOU SHOULD PURCHASE THIS BOOK ONLY IF YOU ARE A DIE HARD FAN OF HARD-CORE SCI-FI."
1,Just plain awful!,"I wasn't that excited about this book to begin with. I'm not all that interested in books based on the events prior to the classic trilogy but I'm a Star Wars freak and I own every Star Wars based novel so I had to buy this one. This book was terrible. It is almost as bad if not worse than Children of the Jedi. The storyline was disjointed and bland. The new characters were shallow. I especially couldn't stand the bloodcarver. The chapters were so short that it was impossible to get into the pertaining plotline. Because of the short chapters I was never compelled to continue to read. A Star Wars book usually takes me two to three days to read. This one took me a week. The only high point was Tarkin. It was interesting to see this character, who had always compelled me, expanded on. Sienar was also an interesting guy but that was about it. Unless you're a die hard fan like me I would not recommend this book. It really stinks."
2,"A decent read, but nothing spectacular.","I'm a big fan of the Star Wars novels, and am really enjoying the New Jedi Order storyline, but the novels based on Episode I have been really disappointing. Rogue Planet is an OK story about Anakin and Obi-Wan that really doesn't matter in the overall scheme of things. There is an aspect of the story that ties into the New Jedi Order storyline, but aside from that it's a pretty forgettable book. I guess I'm just used to better from the Star Wars franchise. This just seemed like a waste of [money]. I think I'll opt for the paperback editions of these EpisodeI/II tie-ins in the future."
3,Dissapointing,It wasn't nearly what i was hoping for. It could have been alot better. It samed to drag on and was very hard to finish. I don't know with and introduction like that i don't think i want to read greg bears next book.If you cant get the real person to do a shot make it animated the cover looks so stupid. Obi-Wan looks totally lame.
4,A different though nice edition to Star Wars,"Bear's new Star War's novel, ""Rogue Planet"", was certainly enjoyed by me. I liked the caharachterizations of Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi and the story line, although hard to follow at points, was somewhat interesting and creative. However, it was a different kind of Star Wars novel, and sometimes lacked the science fiction feel. Of course, there were moments that were full of ships and designs and everything, though it's still that loss of Star Wars feel. Over all, though, it was a good book. The dercriptions of Zonama Sekot and of ship designs as well as ships and charachters were intriquing, the dramatic parts were thrilling, and the story made you think."
5,I LOVED IT!,"I waited 5 days for htis book to come UPS, and It was well worth the wait. I loved how the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin was almost like father-son! I loved how it started off with Anakin in trouble!Being a HUGE Obi-Wan fan, I found myself wishing that Obi-Wan could be the chosen one instead of Anakin, and I HATED when Anakin bragged! I loved the book and loved Obi-Wan in it (A PERFECT JEDI KNIGHT! ) A must read for ANY Star Wars fan!"
3,O.K but could have been better,I thought this book was O.K with some good scenes The begining Garbage pit scene the scenes between Seinar and Tarkind and Obi-wan and Anakin but apart from that the book had no action and did not really go any where. I was just turning the pages waiting for somthing to happen but nothing ever did and the charachters veered of the general plot piont of loking for a missing Jedi to build a living space ship. Overall the book needed some action scenes and and bit more faster pace other wise it was o.k. Thought it was more a science fiction book than a Stawars book.
2,Boring...,"Well the long waited book came. I was disappointed to say the least. I found the characters and story line to be rather unusual and strange. Strange or sort of dingy... nothing like a follow-up to the first episode. The characters were hard to believe. I even felt the idea of a space ship that was alive, a living creature, was far fetched. The bonding with spine balls reminded me more of my sweet gum tree than a ""space creature"". Sorry but I feel even the 2 star was not what I would give it. shakey@atei.net"
2,"Good Book, Bad Star Wars","Greg Bear is an excellent author, and I have enjoyed several of his books. On the whole, this is a good novel, but Star Wars it is not. Star Wars movies and books are supposed to be action packed and exciting Space Opera, not hard sci-fi. This one, while interesting, is neither exciting nor action packed. It hammers plot developments into your head without the proper action framework to keep you interested. While I am sick to death of every Star Wars novel involving some super weapon or new menace to the Republic, I was disappointed with this effort at doing something different."
1,Rogue Planet,"This is one of the worst Star Wars books I've read. It's confusing, nebulous, hazy. It has no depth, no background. It introduces people without exploring them in the least bit, hints and suggests without coming through, and told me more in the ""looking forward"" on the last page than the whole book. I was very disappointed and hope the next movie isn't this bad!"
1,An Almost Complete Waste of Paper,"I really didn't like this book to say the least. I didn't like the way it was written. I didn't like the story line at all. None of it made much of any sense and much of it seemed to contradict some basic Jedi guidelines. I was looking forward to reading this I thought it would go more into the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin a few years after Episode 1. I thought it might include some insight on Padawan training. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Overall it was a really stupid story that wasn't at all believable, even in the realm of the Star Wars universe. Just bad.It does have a couple relevant story lines that you might want to know if you plan on or do read all the Star Wars books published. I would only read this if you are one of those people, otherwise I would definitely recommend skipping this one."
4,"Good book, but a little slow paced","This book did a great job of establishing Anakin Skywalker as a young apprentice adjusting to his new life with Obi-Wan. A little slow in some points, but it does a good job in setting up the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan and the differences between each character and the Force."
5,Good Combination of Thoughtful Sci-Fi and Space Opera Action,This book starts off with intense action and then slows down to build into a crescendo. Very interesting Star Wars book.
5,Hard words,"If you're a kid that's a star wars fan and you want to read this book, I think a grown up should read it with you if you don't understand. But if you want to know the storyline, don't ask me. I'm only on page 10."
2,Rogue Planet is a rogue Star Wars book.,"To put it in a nutshell, this book is too slow. Nothing happens and all this stuff about organic, living ships just doesn't seem like ""George Lucas"" Star Wars. For a time that the Republic is falling apart, there just wasn't a lot of action. Also, if Raith Seinar is the designer of the Death Star, this contradicts with the ""Jedi Academy"" series in that the scientists in the Maw (who built the Sun Crusher of this series)designed and built it. Bear tried to be too flashy with his words and was sometimes confusing when describing the feelings of Master and apprentice."
2,Not that great,"Sorry mr. Bear but you have really faltered on this one. This is only the second book i have read in the Star Wars series that I haven't liked(The other was Children of the Jedi). Leave it to Stackpole, Zahn and the ultimate comedian Aaron Allston"
2,This novel although interesting is still lacking,"I read this book because all the Star Wars lists say it fills in background information that is needed to fully understand the Star Wars Universe. They were wrong! This book did give some insight to the future Death Star and other helpful info; yet it was an awefully boring book to read just to get these limited facts. There is almost no action at all until the last few chapters. The author goes on and on about this seemingly important spaceship for the whole length of the book and come to find out it is NOT IMPORTANT AT ALL. The author does do a good job describing the setting and the characters, but other than descriptions it is completely uninteresting. So I would read this book only if you have nothing better to do or you are a BIG Star Wars fan."
3,Written like 2 books and the second half is better,"Overall, I enjoyed this book, but I found the first half to be a bit of chore. The second half of the book - when Obi-Wan Kenobi and his now 12-year-old Padawan, Anakin Skywalker finally get to Zonama Sekot - moves along a lot better. Zonama Sekot is a fascinating place and what Anakin experiences there gives you a few clues as to his eventual transformation into a Sith Lord."
3,STAR WARS - ROGUE PLANET,This started a little slow but ended nicely. I loved the reactions and aggresions of youth and the living planet concept.Wonderful.
5,Rouge Planet is what we need in between movies,"The book was excellent. It fueled the need I needed for more Star Wars after Episode 1 came out. It keeps fans occupied while Episode 2 is being filmed. The author captures Obi-Wan and Anakin great, and it's really exciting to read about Tarkin (Who will become the well known Grand Moff Tarkin) and see how Episode 2 is starting to lead into the original movies (Episode 4 - A New Hope)"
2,"Not worth it, didn't add to the Star Wars Saga","I was very disappointed in this book. Very little time spent on Anakin's struggle and Obi-Wan tutoring. Way too much time spent on describing the seeds/ship building. Very rushed at the end, no suspense at all.The describing of the ship building and the seeds was way too detailed (like Vector Prime's description of the bad guys). I am concerned the Star Wars Saga is being diluted with inferior products. I have read a lot of books on Star Wars, the last paperback was great. They have to start working on delivering quality and not quantity.These books need to tell more of a story and less on ""sci-fi"" descriptions of different beings."
3,For the Star Wars extended universe fan,"Pretty good read.Although the authour is disjointed in his narrative at times, which proves to be distracting, if you stick with it, the book ends up telling a good story with the interesting concept of organic starships.The story introduces us to the possible origins of the plans for the eventual Death Star.It is set on the planet Ansion, which Obi-Wan a Anakin apparently return to for a boarder dispute immediately prior to Episode II.In the telling of the story, the authour shows us that even at the young age of 12 or 13, Anakin was showing signs of the troubled padawan we see in Episode II.All in all, a good stoy which gives us an insight into the psyche of Anakin Skywalker.For true Star Wars fans, a recommended read despite the writing style."
1,Silly Planet,"I will not repeat what has already been said that reflects poorly on this novel. All I do have to say is that if you liked the novelizaions of the movies, including the most recent, THE PHANTOM MENACE, you will NOT like this book. Mr. Bear seems to try too hard to add to the Star Wars universe and fails. The middle third of the book drags horribly and then the end is rushed and, I am sorry to say - silly. I cringe whenever I read a STAR WARS novel that feels ""Star Trekie,"" and this one is the worst. If you go for that type of universe, be my guest. However, I feel ROGUE PLANET was a dissapointing sequel to the prequel. Mr. Bear should take some writing tips from Mr. Brooks!"
2,AN AVERAGE OUTING FOR THESE JEDI,"The basic problem with Star Wars: Rogue Planet is that it is just a so-so adventure for Obi-Wan and Anakin. Now, in defense of author Greg Bear, it is a well written novel with some very creative and original concepts. Mr. Bear does what he can to introduce new aliens and to incorporate some characters and conepts that we (as Star Wars fans) love. The chapters dealing with General Tarkin were the strongest in the book (here is a character who can be quite fascinating). But let's be honest until Episode 2 comes out...the characters of Anakin and Obi-Wan aren't going to come across anything ""life changing"".So, if you're going through withdrawl from the Galaxy Far, Far Away...then pick this book up and read it. But, if you're reading to be moved by something ""grand and huge and exploding with excitement""...well there are plenty of other sci-fi books ...."
1,The characters were too complex in description and boring,I tried to keep up with the book but with aliens offering their children to be eaten and the descriptions of the aliens were so bizarre...this author should stick to Star Trek. I don't think Qui-gon and Obi-wan's relationship was portrayed right either because it seems like these two were very distant in life after reading this book. I wish Jude Watson wrote this book instead
4,"Really good book, but slow at times...","I liked this book a lot, but it was kinda slow at times and some of the ideas were a little far-fetched. The idea of a living ship and growing it, etc. was a little out of the Star Wars ballpark. This book is about 3 years after TPM, and we are starting to see Anakin growing more and more impatient and troubled. I liked this book because Obi-Wan, my favorite character, was in it, and he seemed to mature a little too quickly. Anyways, don't get me wrong, this is a cool book and definetly worth reading!"
2,"Cut out 100 pages, and its good","I've read many of the Star Wars novels, and was excited about reading this continuation of the Phantom Menace, but the plot of the story took a tremendously long time to unfold. For about 100 pages, I was hoping for something to happen, only to be pummeled with useless facts and details about a people and planet I had little interest in. I expected the relationship between Anakin and Obiwan to develop, and at times it did. These were the best parts of the book. I was hoping to gain an insite into Anakin's mind, and at times I did. Unfortunately, there was that middle section that did little of either. Anakin likes to go fast and he has a lot of potential. This obvious fact was told to the reader with irritating frequency. It was a great novel at 150 pages, but hard to get through at 250."
1,Worst SW Book ever,I am a big star wars fan and let me tell you if you like star wars you will hate this book. This author wrote the most boring book I have ever read. He needs to stick to Star Trek because he can't handle Star Wars. It's too late for me but save yourself and don't buy this book.
4,Very Well Done,I am a huge fan of the Star Wars saga and this book delivers all the exitment of the origanal films. The story of Anikin Skywalkers training to be a Jedi continues. A must read for any Star Wars fan. This book is very good.
3,It Started Out Well But...,"I really went into this book expecting a lot of action, you know, lightsaber fighting,Force using, something! That never really came about. I love Obi-Wan and expected him to be a major part of this book, but he ends up being rather bland and severe. If he acted like that to Anakin all the time, no wonder he went to the Dark Side.The beginning really was the strongest part. It was interesting and fun, but when the scene changed to Zenoma Sekot (sp) everything became almost unbearably slow, the Jedis' actual mission seemed to be put on the back burner, and there were several confusing sub-plots that I lost interest in. It seemed like Bear had a bunch of good ideas and tried to get them all in this book without developing any of them fully enough.It really was a let down to me. Maybe someone who likes their books slower paced will enjoy this one more than I did."
3,"Too much embellishment, not enough plot","I read this book as my first star wars book hoping to enjoy a fantastic storyline in words, as I enjoyed them in the movies. And I felt let down.The plot takes place after Episode I, but before Episode II; when Anakin begins to grow up and have rebellious feeling and, although in Coruscant; he still enjoys Pod Racing. He get mixed up with the wrong crowd and ObiWan must save him. Then the story turns to the rapidly developing Empire, and a new kind of starship that is alive that the Empire wants. Anyway, I don't want to give away too much, but I felt there was way to much description and to little good plot and exciting details. Jedi battles are also very scarce."
5,It All Clears Up,"In the story given to you by the Phantom Menace and the knowledge that Anakin Skywalker eventually becomes Darth Vader you're left with a gap. You wonder how in the world a sandy-haired kid from Tatoinne could possibly become him when there is so much good in him.Here we come to a point where we see the anger in Anakin as he and Obi-Wan journey to a strange, but force-strong planet. The planet is almost alive you could say. On this planet ships are sold for enourmous rates that are the fastest in the galaxy, and bound to their owner by the force.On this planet Anakin releases anger in huge quantities, although he tries to control it. Anakin realizes his mistakes, and tries to help himself, but Obi-Wan is not yet a very adept Jedi. He does not see that Anakin is in trouble, as someone like Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan's master, would.This story is adept at filling in the blanks where Anakin becomes Darth Vader. It is a great book, although without much action."
3,That was OK.,"Kind of a mediocre book by a Hugo winner. Greg Bear has SOME good ideas, like Charza Kwinn. Sienar was a very good character, but his ""friend"" Tarkin was missed by the dialogue and the goals. Anakin Skywalker seemed a tad off, as did Obi Wan. I liked the Blood Cutter, and the idea of the planet, but the book really should have talked more about what happened to Vergere and the far outsiders. The mystery of Vergere was one of the more engrossing parts of the story, but you never find out what happened to her and what she learned. The entire idea of the Jedi Temple was badly bungled as well. Also, the idea of super fast, organic ships wasn't terribly original, and the ending was extremely dissapointing. A few original characters and ideas save this from dropping lower on my scale, but you should wait for the paper back, or read Dark Tide: Onslaught instead."
2,a quick ending I thought,"I have been a Greg Bear fan for many years and have always been happy with his work. This book in contrast to ones such as Eon or Legacy builds and builds but ends way too quickly to be as satisfactory as I would have liked. It could be that I have set a higher standard for Mr. Bear's works as the man is truly a great thinker and writer. In my opinion it would not be fair to judge him by this book and to read Darwin's radio, Eon, or perhaps Moving Mars to give him a chance."
2,How to build a ship?,"Star wars, one of the greastest movies ever. A side story to it about little darth vader when he was but a pup. This story gives a little insight about his trek to the dark side. But mostly its about them building this stupid ship. A three hundered and twenty page book and 200 is all them building this ship. It is cool at about page 230 every thing before that tells you how to build a ship out of spores."
2,The Force must not have been with him...,"Having recently delved into the world of Star Wars fiction, I excitedly started Rogue Planet. Let me warn you: I love the original three SW movies, the Han Solo trilogy by A.C. Crispin, and Shadows of the Empire by Steven Perry. Perhaps my excitement of an addition to these ""classics"" caused an inevitable let-down, but this book was far from impressive. No action, bad descriptions, a boring plot, character development? I don't think so, and cheesy usage and description of the Force make this a pretty bad experience. Sorry, I don't want to burst anyone's bubble, but this book is not good, and it is definetly in the lower realms of the Star Wars universe. I just hope this is not what Lucas thinks is quality material these days. Churning out another so-so couple of movies to go along with this book, and dare I say the Phantom Menace, would be a tradegy."
3,Meh,"This book was ok, not great not terrible. It adds some interesting information to the Star Wars books series. If you like Star Wars read it, it won't be the best book ever, but you also won't regret reading it."
3,weird,"This is an average book that took place 3 years after the Phantom Menace. The beginning was one of the best parts, involving Anakin participating in a pit-race on Coruscant. The rest seemed rather dragged-out, slightly boring, and weird. The whole planet of Zonoma Sekot was strange, involving things called seed partners? that hatched into ships. A good part of this novel was seeing more of Tarkin, who is a senator at this time. Overall, only recommended to the people who enjoyed Episode 1 above the rest of the Prequels. Others who prefered Episode 2 and 3, just stick to the Clone Wars Novels."
2,What was the story about again?,"I've been a fan of Star Wars for as long as I can remember, but this is the first time I lost interest in a Star Wars related story. I'm still not certain what the plot really was. I thought they went to the rogue planet to look for a missing Jedi. But instead they built a ship, more than half the book was spent talking about building this ship. In fact that is all that comes to mind about this book was building the ship. Perhaps the title should have been called ""Building a Ship"". This is one to skip in the Star Wars line of stories."
3,Disappointing,"The book gets off to a slow start, then never really goes anywhere. It spends a lot of time on the character development of Obi-Wan and Anakin, some of which is interesting. Unfortunately, the book's portrayal of Obi-Wan is that of a rigid, unimaginative person -- not really consistent with his portrayal in any of the movies so far. The rest of the characters are basically shadows, with no real development of any of them. Greg Bear's other novels are much better written than this."
2,A disappointment in the world of Star Wars,"Seeing a new Star Wars book made my heart leap, so immediately I purchased it, and as it arrived at my door, I tore open the wrapping and began reading. In fact, I was reading it every night until 3:00! Well as I was reading, I found the ""evil"" characters to be much more than boring. Every chapter they were involved in made me want to put the book down. The use of language was horrible, considering that the beginning of a chapter was Obi-Wan slept. Who is the author trying to kid? For a book of that size, a bit more detail and imaginative language could have been used. I suggest that you save your money, even if you are a die hard Star wars fan, like myself."
3,Quite adequate,"A slight warning: There is no action in this book (or at least not much.) Not that there is anything wrong with that. This book was mainly character development. I liked it a lot. I've always been and ObiWan and a Tarkin fan. OW sees a lot of growth in this book.As far as plot goes, it was mainly relatively hard SF. The best scenes were those with Tarkin and Seinar although I was intrigued by the mystery of the Pentotium and the Magister. Bar really did a great thing here by developing everyone even Ke Daiv. We see motivations, hidden desires and right into everyones thoughts.The only real negative is that it might be a tad long. But on the whole, this book delivers. Kudos to Bear for bringing something new and different to SW.Read it."
4,Good For Any Star Wars Fan,This book was okay. The begining was great. Then in the middle got a little boring. But at the end it got better! A very quick save! This book is meant for any Star Wars fan!
3,I've got mixed emotions...,"This review is going to be a little complicated. Bear with me. The author did a good job on the writing of the book, but the storyline sucks. To his credit, he didn't have much choice. The post Episode 1 universe is going to have to be severely limited until we know just what George Lucas wants to retain for the movies. Greg Bear, the author, had to find a storyline that was FAR outside the Episode One (and two and three) realm. He did, but it just wasn't as good as it could have been.I have to say, however, that it should not have been written, in my opinion. After the original trilogy, noone was permitted to write books in the Star Wars universe until Timothy Zahn was permitted to. I think a similar ""ban"" should be in place on the new series until it is better defined. Read the book, I think you'll understand."
4,it's ok,"This is when the series started getting stupid. There are a few really great episodes though in this season. Still can't figure how she has the baby, but then she is still pregnant in episodes that follow & still talking about having the baby that she already had in an earlier episode. Must have been all those drugs she did in the 60's."
2,"Slightly dissappointing, but still glad to own it! Did anyone notice ""Jackie"" on the coverart?","It is a big let down that all the episodes in season 8 are cut up. That should have been advertised and not said to be ""Complete."" More importantly, HAS ANYONE NOTICED THAT THE LADY ON THE COVERART IS NOT JACKIE OR ATLEAST SHE LOOKS NOTHING LIKE HER?!?!? TWO STARS FOR THAT!"
2,Not a great Season?,"I have only watched one disc and am very disappointed so far. This is unfortunate as I have bought the first 7 seasons and they were all a laugh a minute. This series seems to be laking the quick wit in all the previous series. I dont like the non story lines between Darlene and David or Becky and Mark, also, the fact Jacki has broken up with Fred is never really explained ?? Not happy at all with this season :("
3,A transfer as sloppy as the scripts,"This is a show in decline and although fans will find something to enjoy in this patchy season (especially after paying for a copy), the poor quality transfer to disc almost symbolises the shoddy workmanship behind the show as it begins to fade. Its almost as if the half-hearted production values were channelled by the technicians making the DVD a decade later."
2,Average Read,"Pacing of the book is languid, the characters lifeless, puzzle predictable. One and a half star."
4,Well written and informative,"Larry Mueller offers his unique way of speed training a bird dog, however, I do feel that his techniques are stressing to a dog - especially a sensitive dog or a young dog (say six-months). Larry does offer some excellent ways to train your dog on the basic obedience/hunting commands, but his use of force training goes beyond my personal preference. If you are a first-time trainer, training your own dog, this book is excellent - if you approach training with love and patience. Remember, you are training a friend and companion, not a strickly business hunting dog."
1,Speed Train Your Own Bird Dog,"I returned this book the day I rcvd it. All it took is for me to flip through the pages and see the trainer recommending giving a knee to teach the dog not to jump up and then the very disturbing picture of him teaching ""whoa"" using a rope thrown over a tree while tied to the dogs neck while standing on a barrel.I have worked around horses and dogs for many years and certainly advocate force when necessary. However, I feel that there are many more ways to train a dog than using the types of methods mentioned above-hence why I returned it."
2,No Mount for Marker,"I can't believe they made a coaches clipboard without a mount for the dry erase marker. It's a pain in the next to tie the marker to the clip board, glue on Velcro, etc.Steve"
4,My little boys LOVE this video,My 2 and 4 year old boys love this movie. We borrowed it from the local library and they always wanted to renew it!
5,Word of Warning,"I also will give this production the full 5 stars. It is an excellent production in all respects; and has been fully described in other reviews.However... T. C. wrote: ""This is a powerful rendition of a great opera, but it takes a lot of concentration and patience to enjoy it. Highly recommended for those who like this kind of music."" That just about sums it up from my point of view. I bought it because I am always trying to expand my experience and knowledge of opera. But this work feels as if it goes on as long as Messiaen took to write it. Comparatively it makes the longeur bits of ""Die Meistersinger"" seem to be written by Rossini. I am not saying that I regret having bought it, despite the price; but I would like to emphasise that it is not everybody's cup of tea.Archie"
2,"Shirtless, Starless, and Sans Cojones","This album seems to be (almost) universally disparaged. According to W. Sheppard, ""STARCASTLE THEMSELVES hate this album! Starcastle didn't even want it released. The record company had rejected their more progressive demos and FORCED them to make this awful pop album.""""Forced,"" eh? Starcastle released an album they personally hated?So much for backbone and artistic integrity.I'm glad the band is letting everyone know they're not to blame for their album. It would be just awful if accountability was something they aspired to."
5,An open mind to different styles,"I loved this book it showed women from all over the world,it tells you about each women. Really good book."
5,Beautiful book and very fast shipment,This I think the 2nd book from Michael Cunningham. I was fortunate enough to have met Michael in Tampa FL where he gave a lecture on his book; CROWNS and I also had him sign the book. Wish I had this book prior to his lecture for him to sign!!!!!
5,Very useful and easy to read,"I bought this book to help me decide whether or not to TiVo. This book quickly sold me on the features of Tivo, so I bought one. The book was very useful during setup, as well as operation of the TiVo. I agree with everything in the ""Big Help"" review, so I won't repeat it here."
3,Great until it matters,"If a poorly done ending can ruin a book or author for you, stay away from this work. You will meet two very well written and extremely captivating characters who will meet in an epic clash... and then its like someone else came in to write 3 hurried pages of lame, poorly constructed junk (which is the rest of the book... that's right, huge build up, they see each other, 3 pages later you're at the back cover!). Never mind who wins or loses, none of it makes sense anyway. Neither story arc is brought to a solid conclusion and neither one makes a point. I don't need a ""happy"" ending, but I do ask for a complete story that feels poignant... this one needed at least 50 more pages. I'm certain that Abnett was side tracked by one of his many other projects and this incredible fruit was suddenly left to rot on the vine."
3,Too fast paced!,"Although I enjoyed this book, I feel that it was a little to fast paced for me. The charaters fell for each other way to fast and got involved with each other before really getting to know each other. I know that love at first sight happens but it's rare and usually physical and not long lasting. I would of enjoyed the book more if the charaters had spent a little more time developing a realistic relationship."
2,"Quirky, Equivocal Man Builds Ugly House on Beautiful Island","Mr Mehta has a gift for writing much about nothing. To put it simply, the reader is left feeling like his psychotherapist.Here is a man who's building a house on the coast of Maine yet wants the walls to be utterly soundproof--to lock out the slurping and crashing of the coastal waters. Sheetrock is a recurring demon that plagues his adult life. Throughout the book, Mr Mehta gives up and decides to sell off his investment. In fact, this theme is so frequent, you begin to wonder if he wrote the book to simply help market the house.While the book holds some undoubtedly poignant memories for Mr Mehta; for the reader, it lacks any sense of coastal Maine. There is no feel of wind or fog; there is no smell of salty pine; and you certainly don't hear the crunch of sticks and rocks beneath your feet. You spend most of the book stifling in his New York apartment while he argues with himself, his architect, and his builder."
2,A Disappointment,"I found this book to be tedious and far too concerned with the parochial, and frankly dull, details of Mr. Mehta's feelings about having a house built on an island off the coast of Maine. Not enough about Maine. Too much about Mehta. Too bad."
3,Nice watch - description & color not clear,"I liked the watch and it was a very good buy. However, I returned it as the fact that the strap was patent leather wasn't spelled out in the description (I note now that it says ""shiny"" - don't think it did before). Also the strap's color was more orange than on-screen and didn't compliment the red in my various clothes."
2,Man's Work (?),"The pictures are colorful and bright and the dad and son do look like they are having a good time working together. I am disappointed the book does not include any pictures of them doing what most men consider ""man's work."" Where are the pictures of them raking the yard, cleaning the car, using tools to fix something, washing the dog, etc.? My husband was actually offended by the feminization of the pictures. There are a couple of pictures where the man looks like a female."
1,Disappointing. Get the O'Reilly book instead,"Amazon gave this book it's networking title of the year for 1998 but it's hard to see why. The book is shallow and disorganized. It covers a lot of topics but doesn't give enough detail to get the job done. O'Reilly's Windows NT TCP/IP Network Administration covers the same material and does a much better job of it. Another reviewer implied that this book was ""just as good as an O'Reilly."" It isn't."
4,Got it when I needed it.,"This book is so good at explaining the concept of biological anthropology. It looks smallk, but it is reach in knowledge, and I got it very cheap from amazon.com"
2,Did not work and had to return it,"I could link up via the wired portion to my DSL and it was fine. However, the WiFi was damaged. Tech support (from India) was helpful and help diagnose the problem. It had to be returned for a new one. I just ended up sending it back for a refund.I'll probably keep looking for something a little cheaper."
1,I would not buy it again,"The 'content filter' is a useless string match within URLs and does not work for IP addresses. The FM114P does not work when connected to a micro repeater, support is not existent and my box died after only 2 month."
4,Poor support powerful product,"I'm very happy with the performance. I had a problem with the epson printer driver and the windows 98. After 2 hours and 3 calls to india support they told me that they would call me back. They never did. I did some research on the internet, and I found that if I install the generic windows driver instead of advanced epson driver it would work, and it did. Well, support didn't know that. Great product if you won't need to call support.I used Linksys before and performance was very poor, and I returned it."
2,So-so performer for the price,"The Netgear FM114P is easy to set up and administer via its built-in web interface. The rest is problematic.We have had intermittant lock-ups where the router simply stopped working and we had to reboot the router to continue connecting to the web.We have had nothing but grief from the built-in print server, which likewise has sporadic failures requiring reboot. (We are looking at buying a separate print server to solve this problem.)The wireless works OK, although the throughput seems quite variable.Overall, I'm unimpressed, and will not likely buy any more Netgear products. Giving it a 2 may be a bit unfair; a 2.5 would be about right."
4,Up and running in just a few minutes,"I looked at lots of products and read tons of reviews before selecting the netgear FM114P. Set up was no problem. My access provider, comcast.net, uses dynamic IP addresses, so I didn't have to change any of my network properities. Just remember to clear and re-acquire your dynamic IP address, I also had to shut down and re-start my cable modem.The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that I haven't gotten the print server to work yet. It dosen't ""see"" my printer. This may be because I have an older printer."
4,Router failed but good customer support,"I bought this router August/September 2002 (I forgot the exact date) and I loved the router. Easy installation, reliable, good features. However, 11 months later the router failed. The TEST LED was on and all of the ethernet ports were not working. I called tech support and after 10 minutes of waiting on the phone the technician diagnosed the problem and after 3 minutes of debugging the device he determined that I needed a replacement router. I should be getting the replacement router in a day or two. I'm not happy that the router failed, but the technician was helpful on the phone and did not hesitate to send a replacement router to me. I would recommend NetGear because of their customer support and product features."
1,No good.,I've upgraded the firmware backwards and forwards but this puppy drops connections like my old switch never does. Everything seems to work fine but then a larger download and it consistently doesn't complete. I've changed the MTU size and that seems to have an effect but it's still erratic and won't complete downloads. I switch back the to switch and 'no problem'. I'm using it in wired mode so its not a WiFi issue.
3,Works great while it lasts.,"Very pleased with the set-up and performance. Unfortuanately, it died in just 11 months of use. Very disappointed. Netgear also failed to honor rebate. Buying another brand (Linksys) and hoping for better results."
1,"Great features, but unreliable","The Netgear FM114P is almost a perfect firewall, wireless access point, and print server. Good price, decent features.My only complaint: I've had mine die on me twice, each time after about 2-3 months of use.So the question is: What good is a firewall when you can't depend on it to work the next day?This would be a great product if Netgear can fix the reliability issues. Who knows, perhaps my third unit will last till the summer.Update: My third replacement unit failed after a week."
2,Overheats,"I had this product for almost a year with no problems, except that it was hot to the touch. But then came one major problem. Somewhere between 8-9 pm, different time every night, the internet would slow down to a impossible crawl. It would start working correctly after 1 am. I tried everything to stop the problem. Nothing worked. So I gave up, bought a new router and the problem disappeared. The odd thing was that when it was not working correctly it was not hot. So my guess is that it was over heating. Seems that it is a problem with this model. By the way I bought the Netgear MR814v2 and so far it works great."
1,Heat Warning,"I had a great time with this router, easy to setup, decent WiFi range. But It is so poorly vented it burned itself out. Really this thing would be 140-150 degrees during little to no usage. I recommend the newer netgear routers, cheaper, lighter, and they don't overheat at all. I hope mine was just a lemon, I always recommend netgear over linksys."
1,2 routers = 2 failures,I have had two of these routers both of which have failed shortly after the warranty expired. I kept the router on 24/7 but for some reason if the router gets unplugged from the power outlet it is difficult and finally impossible to get the router to come back up after plugging back in (after the warranty expired no less). The test light stays on continously now on both routers. No amount of resetting/unplugging has brought them out of the test mode. I'm guessing that they are using poor quality components to keep the price so cheap. I also use a very expensive line conditioner that it is/was plugged into to no avail. Will be looking at a SonicWall device for a replacement.
5,better than the other popular brand,"I normally like to carry my golf bag. However, with an increasing trend of ""slow play"" I decided to get the Bag Boy EZ Fold LX Push Cart. I looked at the other popular brand that my golfing friends got. For about $13 more, I got the better cart. No doubt about it."
4,Blues,"Hersey's Blues is an excellent fishing, science, cooking and philosophy of Blue fish. Great images of Martha's Vineyard - a delightful book. Informative and easy reading."
2,Slow reading for a nonfisherperson,I think that you have to be a fisherperson to enjoy this book. Hersey has written one of the best books I've ever read and one of the more boring ones. This was the boring one and HIROSHIMA was one of the best.
2,Item not as advertised,"This was a book that was not in the condition as advertised. It had ink marks on the edges of the pages and the pages were trade copy quality instead of tight and smooth. I specifically chose this seller for the description they gave of the condition of the book, as it was for a gift. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
5,Robert Neff's Photos are a Treasure,This is a very special book from the early 70s when Shaboo Inn was a gathering place for fans of the blues and great rock. The interviews are insightful and the photos a wonderful legacy for the performers here.
5,simply the best,"A very good album, in my opinion. A great way to learn the Italian language, great melodies and a distinct voice :)"
5,"New Twist, Old legend",Magic of Camelot gives us a fresh view into an old tale. The Arthurian tale has been told and retold many times before. Many have taken their own spin and included their own fiction into this legendary story. The amount of time this legend has circulated in various forms is long and the forms it has taken are many. This one stands out. Introducing the main character with a fictional role who can look in at all the well known story constants gives us a look inside. Feeling like we are there without muddying the waters of the standard legends any more than necessary. The research done on the period is spot on and the treatment of the characters and situations provides a sense of realism to the fiction seldom seen in a modern fiction/fantasy. I look forward to future stories with Isabel as the lens for us to look through and find a view of history that may not be translating facts as they happened but definitely a feel of the age written about.
3,"A good guideline, but by no means complete...","The book is on the whole fairly decent, but has some very frustrating elements. In my opinion, the worst is that at the beginning of the chapter, exam objectives covered in that chapter were listed, and on occasion, there were objectives listed that were not so much as mentioned in the chapter. Particularly bad was coverage of packaging/deployment and ActiveX documents. However, between this book and extensive MSDN searching, I passed 70-176. In synopsis, this book is a good source, but don't expect to simply read it and then go pass the exam."
2,Book full of mistakes,"I thought the book will be good as I had read the sample chapters before buying it. Chapter 14 & 18 are really good, however book has some grave mistakes. For instance the answers of the Quiz at the end of Chapter 13 are totally out of place. Moreover, in another Chapter all variables declared in general decalrtion section of a Class Module have been declared Public with associated Public Property Get/Let Procedures. I believe its against the requirments of encapsulation. I wonder if I will be able to clear Exam 70-176 with this book alone........."
1,Somebody is entering false ratings,"Lets see 5 stars in a row?! Yeah right, I actually owned this so-called book and read it from front to back, and I will guarrantee this book alone WILL NOT get you VB 6 certified as it claims to be able to. In fact, it does not even cover some of the topics Microsoft states you need to know. There are way better books than this error, bug ridden waste of paper."
4,Excellent Book,covers a wide range of topics and not baby-sits reader with small and obvious details. Could have earn five stars if cover more on database access. I have to buy a separate book just for database.
1,Its time to tell the truth,"This book did not cover enough of the package and deployment wizard, nor did it even mention the Treeview controls, which ""was"" on the test. I would pass on this book. I got more info off MSDN, and that was free."
2,"Good to learn VB 6, not detailed enough for exams","This is a good intro book to VB 6, however it DOES NOT go in to enough depth and cover enough topics to pass the MS VB6 exams. You are better off getting Transcender CDs and using them to study. The practice exam you download from their website is worthless."
1,Keep looking......,"This book was a slap in the face to all VB programmers. They preach ""their"" coding techniques to you, then they don't follow it themselves. By the way, they other reviews about this book being full of bugs, is correct!"
5,Good companion reference for exam prep,"The only materials I used to prep for the VB6 Distributed exam was Trancender's VB6 simulation exams - and this book. I had already been using VB for about 2 years and this is the only ""VB6"" book that I own that is not MTS specific. After taking some sample tests I beefed up on any ""weak"" areas using this book. It is great for finding short, hands-on examples of projects that will teach you exam objectives but not of much use for the experienced VB programmer who wants a more in-depth or advanced resource."
1,Zero stars,"If you are looking for a good book to study for the VB 6 exams, this is not it. This book had so many errors and missed several key components that were on the test. I returned my book and got my money back."
2,This book is poorly edited and omits important information.,"This book looks good, but as I used it to study I found some big issues.First, it's poorly edited.I found many typos, and the answers to the test exam for Chapter 13 are WRONG.In some cases they offered information that did not work. For instance, I could not get the ""WriteProperties"" event to fire for a persistable public class even though I followed their instructions to the letter (this may be a VB6 bug).Second, the authors claim to have covered skills in the exam matrix in certain chapters. However, after reading those chapters I found they hadn't covered them at all. A good example is the 70-176(21) skill (Using the Visual Component Manager). They were supposed to have covered this in Chapter 21, but included only a passing reference to it.If you use this book, you'd better double-check everything the authors say, and you'll need to refer to VB's documentation and other sources to get the full dope."
1,1 star may be too high,"This was my first MCSD book purchase and I was disappointedright out of the starting gate. There are multiple typos. Some ofthe information given in the book is misleading or incorrect. The software that is supposed to be on the CD ISN'T THERE, you have to download it. And it's not very professional looking. I started a list of typos, corrections, problems, etc and quit after the first few chapters.Quite frankly if anyone gave this book more than 2 stars then they obviously aren't very good programmers. If you want a GOOD book, Try NEW RIDERS Training Guide MCSD Visual Basic 6 Exams. ISBN 0-7357-0002-8. THAT IS WHAT AN MCSD book should be. this book is VERY disappointing."
3,Not the whole ball of wax.,"Want to get certified. This can't be your only source and hope to pass. Mixing the 175&176 subjects is confusing for study but all in all it provides good coverage of most subject matter included on the test. Sample test is not a good reflection of the actual exam so WATCH OUT. If you want to pass the certs get this book (to start with), a certified practice exam and read ALOT of the MSDN information."
5,A Great addition to any collection!,This set is probably the best detailed piece out of the Revenge of the Sith series I have seen yet. Obi-Wan is not posable at all but fits into Boga's seat perfectly. He actually looks more like Ewen Mcgregor than the basic figure. Boga is really great. The detail on both of them are amazing. The action feature joints on Boga blend in well with the figure as well. Get this set and Grievous' wheel bike and recreate the chase scene from the upcoming movie!
5,lovely,These earrings were as described- very light and elegant looking. I gave them to my mother for Christmas and she really loves them.
2,Bazooka FAST-1770 1986-Up Fast-Ford/ Linc/ Merc,"This product do not fit to a Ford Taurus 2001. After buy this product, I paid for other product to instal my Bazooka on my Taurus 2001."
1,didn't fit,"ordered for 2007 F150, didn't fit my radio. Make sure you go to bazooka's web site and look at the picture of the connector and compare it to your radio harness."
1,does not fit. crap directions,This does not fit in my 2006 Ford Focus. The wiring harnesses on this are completely different sizes from the one coming out of my Focus. It also comes with no instructions for this particular harness. Im pretty disappointed in Bazooka.
3,Nice Cartoon but With No Spoken Language,"I enjoyed the cartoon while living in Poland, 30 years ago, and bought its DVD for my toddler for Polish language exposure. However, what I did not remember is that the story does not use words. So, although the story is fun to watch, it does not have any linguistic benefits for my family."
4,Excellence in Print,"I asked the man to whom I gave this book to write this review. He did so, writing ""I feel the book Courage, by Edwin Louis Cole, is a very inspirational and motivational book. It is an eye-opener on how men should become more inspirational and have a better belief in God, and when they lose faith to just repent and ask yourself and others for forgiveness. It really does maximize your manhood, and will help you become closer to God. All you have to do is have faith. It is a very good book."""
1,Broke in a week,This is a nice case IF you just wanna case...but if you wanna have this case and use everything on it (LIKE THE CLIP)...you won't be able to for long. I was very gentle with my case and it still broke off.
1,PROBLEMS,THE LEFT PART OF THE HOOK OR HANGER (JOINT) GOT BROKEN AFTER ONLY 3 WEEKS OF USE. IS THERE ANY WARRANTY?
3,Too Difficult,This puzzle was very difficult and the pieces were extremely hard to distinguish what went where. I never did manage to complete this puzzle and lost interest in it after a few tries.
4,Heavy duty book.,"This is one of the most well documented books I have ever read (beside an encyclopedia). That is one reason I gave it only4 stars. After reading just the first four or five chapters, I have to say It gets a bit tiring reading history facts in each chapter. The content, though, is wonderful and very, very informative. There are very many names and dates and then more names and dates.All the information tends to slow a person down while trying to follow the authors' message and i hope I can pick up speed as I get more into it. I wonder if the author would consider a condensed version for those of us who want to know the main things and may not have the time to learn all those people....?"
2,While Men Slept...A Biblical and Historical Account of the New Universal Christianity,"STRONGLY BIASEDThe title is misleading. A more accurate title would be: ""...A Biblical and Historical Attack on Roman Catholicism"". How could it be considered ""Christian"" to implicate as evil the faith of over a billion Christians world-wide? Please know that many of the references, although extensive, may not be reliable. Quotes are taken out of context, and the result is distortion of their original meaning and intent;(i.e., pg. 430, reference 82). Common misconceptions abound, especially regarding papal infallibility and ""Mary worship"".Ironically, this book dedicated to knowing the ""truth"" is guilty of the same literary manipulation decried within its pages."
3,Nice graphics but...,"this is a cool game if your into the whole one race and now its boring kind of thing... i personally think having ""damage"" in a game is one of the most important things.. it adds a BIG amount of realism along with some cool effect makin the game more enjoyable... being 2 laps down and still being able to win is kinda lame... i recommend ""1nsane"" to all you guys looking for a good 4x4 game.. it has great graphics and awesome damage effects and very realistic handling with th suspension and all.. but anyways.. go get 1nsane!"
4,Great Game Except....,"I played this on game cube, and it rocks. 100's of upgrades for your vehicle, beautiful tracks, and amazing graphics make this game great. Not much better than cruising with a 705 hp Lancruiser riding on an 8 inch lift and 38s. As you race you gain reputation and can qualify for teams, getting special parts and trucks. Also, 14 inch lift sucks. I tried it on a tacoma and i rolled over backwards going up a steep hill.No damage when you roll over or drive into the water took this game down a star. Also, there are 4 vehicle sounds. small suv, large suv, light truck, and heavy truck. The vehicle modeling is a little off too. you can turn tighter than you should be able to at 60 mph.Overall, the fun of upgrading your car, the racing, and the graphics almost completely outweigh the cons. The best offroad game I've found."
1,"Disappointing wedding album -- Chris in Boulder, CO","We were disappointed by this album. The songs were pitifully uncreative and uninspiring. We are still searching for some quality music to reflect God's place as the focus of our marriage. For anyone interested in buying this album, it might be worth your while to get a feel for the various artists featured on the album, and make sure this is the kind of music you like. In general, the musical stylings harkened back to the forgettable days of 80's pop-Christian music. On a positive note, the cover art on the album wasn't all that bad."
2,"silly-silly-silly-silly-silly, says Lisa & curtis","we thought that while we were listening to this,that in the meantime, that we were not happy with the total thing that was going on, while we were still listening to this thing ."
2,minimal coverage of medicinal chemistry,Anyone wishing a more comprehensive treatment should utilize Foye's Medicinal Chemistry or Goodman and Gillmans work.
3,Greatest hits - no not really,"Ruthless are just eating off bone's legacy.

2,Save your money and get the DVD instead,"If you own all of Bone's albums, solos, and Mo Thugs, then you don't need this album. About half the songs aren't even hits and shouldn't be on there. Bone had nothing to do with the album which is why the tracklist is weak. Interestingly enough, this was supposed to be the Collection Volume 3 (which would have had some remixes, unrealesed stuff off East1999/Eternal, and other colaborations they did) but I guess was scrapped at the last minute for this mediocre CD. If you don't own all their stuff or are missing some songs, then get it, otherwise just get the DVD with the vidoes (which I noticed they left out other videos which were previously on volume 1 as well as never released at all: BNK, If I Could Teach the World, Days of Our Lives, World so Cruel, War and Weed Song)"
4,Not Really Greatest Hits,There are some good tracks but coud have made it better.But Still worth your money though.
2,GREATEST HITS????,"I been a bone thugs fan for a while now and I have to say this is not all the best hits. The first cd is very nice and worth its value but the second cd is not good. the only good songs from the second cd is resurrection (paper, paper), thugz cry, and ecstasy. the songs that are real hits are eternal,east 1999, mo murda, no surrender, sleepwalkers, handle the vibe, down 71 (the getaway), 7 sign, and bone,bone,bone. this are some of their real hits. The ones I didn't mention on the second cd are boring and I bet u dont want to hear them. this songs should been put on the second cd. I would give this cd a 5 star but I wont with those songs I dont like."
3,ruthless 2 buy this,1st off I'am a true bone fan and this is not a real bone thug c.d. bone thugs had no intension to reales a greatist hits album they had hits and more to come so if you buy this c.d know you are not suporting bone but that you are suporting tomica wright and ruthless records this was not bone's Idea it was tomica wright's idea bone got out of there contract with ruthless records two years ago she's just living off there legcy and it's missen if I could teach the world save you money more importent don't put money in tomica wrights perse o to thug life army.com don't tell no one not ta burn this but ta buy this crap get your facts together. Thats it Gods bless everyone
2,Save yourself the money,"I'm a really big fan of Bone thugs, but their collections or ""greatest hits"" is not their strong point.They're a few good @$$ tracks missing from it such as Make my Day, Sleep walkers, Set it straight, shots 2 the double glock, and of course No surrender."
5,A fabulous book,"For over thirty years, Canadian photojournalist Fred Bruemmer has lived with and photographed the Arctic peoples of North America, and in this book he draws on his numerous experiences to fashion poignant and moving memoir of his life in the North and the many people who he has met. This is a book that for someone like myself, who has a limited understanding of this region, will give them new understanding and deeper insight into its past and the lives of the peoples who have inhabited it for countless generations."
3,Almost excelent,"The way the differents items are treated is interesting. I find them with some lack of practicity, experience and confidence transmission form the editos and authors.Perhaps is very difficult to fullfill seniors anesthesiologists expectatives.Thanks"
2,Difficult book to follow,"I love books on true hauntings and read as many as I can get my hands on. This book was really hard to figure out; it kept jumping around from chapter to chapter, person to person, and event to event. It was difficult to tell exactly who or what the author was talking about at any given time. There were several times I was completely lost as to who or what the author was referring to. The grammar, spelling and punctuation weren't the best either. There were good investigative details about the haunting itself, though, and that's really the only thing that kept me reading until the end of the book."
1,60 min. with Michael Buble is a ripoff!,"I thought it had songs on it, and all it is, is about 10 min. of interview interspersed with some music. If I had known that, I would not have purchased it. Very disappointed! It was a gift for my husband."
2,Fun and frustrating,"Finally a Star Trek game that really kicks it!Yet, so disappointing so far because they should not have released this version for Mac. My Mac brothers and sisters, this game has a serious bug in the multiplayer (holomatch) that makes it so you can't see your or your opponents shots using two of the most vital weapons! I find it outrageous they don't tell you this. It's a crippleing defect and I don't know how they couldn't have seen it and it's still not fixed."
5,Awards Directory of Children's Literature,An excellent guide that is well organized and easy to use. A reference book that will become a thoroughly 'dog-eared' part of your collection.
5,A ROCK AND ROLL RIDE TO THE PAST.,This is what rock was all about. Good times and music that filled with you with energy and made your heart beat like a train. The songs on this cd take you back to a time when musis was about having fun and falling in love. Every track rocks and is a great collection for any 80's hard rock fans.
5,A rewarding series on Padre Pio - highly recommended!,"After watching this series, done with love, I came away with a deeper understanding and familiarity of this beloved saint and servant of God, his heroic virtues, great devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, his many miracles and gifts, etc. Many anecdotes provide a lively depiction of his personality, too. There is also historical footage. Watching this series was a conversion experience. Fr. Andrew Apostoli is a warm and welcoming host, and it makes watching this series a joy."
5,Great Gift,"I bought this as an anniversary gift for my folks who have begun taking tons of digital pictures. After doing a bit of research, I ordered the 5x7 PV1. It arrived sooner (about 5 days) than estimated and delighted the folks in general. My father called about a week later and said it was the first electronic device (vs. computers, PDAs, GPS', printers, etc.) that he'd ever had that was TRULY plug and play - no hassles, missing software upon installation, glitches, restarts, adjustments, etc. He'd installed it, plugged his camera's memory card into it, and away it went! For folks who really want a way to see their digital photos instead of just glancing at them when they're first downloaded and then don't really do much with them after that, this is a great device! I just wish the 8x10 model was a bit more affordable..."
4,Decent digital from for the price,"PROS:We've had one of these for about a year. I think its pretty easy to get pictures into the frame - I currently use an SD card and a compact flash card. I use google's picassa software to do a mass export to 640x480 which works out well. We have it in our living room and its nice to look over and see different pics all the time.CONS:Well, the viewing angle on the screen isn't the best - so, you have to be looking at it just so to see it. The screen size is kind of smallish - I think its smaller than a 5x7 picture. And the frame itself looks like a toy - not a picture frame.While I would buy one of these again (especially if its close to $100), I would be more likely to purchase a digital frame with a slightly larger screen, and a more traditional wood frame look to it, for slightly more..."
1,Screen sucks,"This digital photo frame has a ton of great ways to get photos on it. About every type of card slot and a USB port you can stick a thumb drive into. It's a good price too.But the screen is awful. The viewing angle is very bad, the color is washed out with a green tint. The resolution is downright poor.In short, it's the worst LCD screen I have ever seen."
3,I thought that the future was here... but it isn't.,"I was under the impression that we would soon have flying cars and the such as this is the 21st century. I also thought that we would have neat digital photo slideshow thingies like they have in all of the future spaceshipy movies. Something to look at and remember the families that we left behind, including bits of video and sound.This thing does all of that with two major drawbacks.1. No battery. It is all driven off of a power cord. yuck.2. The resolution on the screen sucks. It is not even as good as a screen on the back of a cheap digital camera.2.5. Color quality is not so good. Viewable angle is horrid.I expected more for this price point. But it is what it is.Would I buy another one?Um.. no."
4,So far so good,"I will start by saying I only gave this item 4 stars because we have not yet had a chance to play with all the features. For out of the box ease of use and ready to play our digital photos right off the memory card from the camera it would have to score 5 stars. If you've got family that is not tech savy don't worry as this unit is nearly plug and play and it really took nothing more than plugging it in and putting a memory card in it to start showing our images.We hope to have the time to play with the software some and to get both converted images, some mp3's and some movie files onto the unit here soon but if what we have seen so far is the norm then using the more advance features will be a breeze as well."
1,poor resolution,I bought this hoping it would be a substitute for printing pictures for my wife to show to friends: no-way! I was apparently naive in assuming I would get the same picture resolution and color quality as my laptop. It was also very slow changing pics. Don't bother.
2,"Good idea, but doesn't quite cut it.","I found this to be a well made unit, and pretty easy to set up and use, but the picture quality is pretty bad. Maybe the technology just isn't there yet...I'm returning mine, and will wait for the next generation."
3,AC Adapter did not work,"I jumped on this when Digital frames were just coming out, paid too much for it then, and the AC adapter did not work. Both a generic adapter and have forgotten everything else. I have 11 years of watching my kids grow up and it is inspirational."
4,Good value,"Nice little device. Quite easy to use; surprised to see that others found it a challenge. True, it isn't a computer monitor, but the picture is really quite good enough to display 5x7 photos, properly cropped."
3,It's ok for portable pictures to work or a friends house.,It works good for my parents wanting to show their vacation photos to people at work but if you want to enjoy all of your pictures on a daily basis on your laptop or desktop then pictureshare is a better product. It's the best wallpaper changer and you can easily email your pictures to family who sign up on pictureshare. Pictureshare will also go get ceiva pictures if your family has ceiva frames. I think the fact you can only see what pictures you have on the card limits the memory frame. Go have a look at [...] if you want to see all your picturs and share through email with family and friends. The best program I've found and doesn't cost much.
1,difficult to operate.,"I bought this item for my husband for christmas and we could not get the pictures to appear on the screen. I have an engineering degree and could not, after 45 minutes get the pictures to appear on the screen. Way too complicated...i expected to get a better quality product for what i paid."
1,Not usable,"I ordered the PV1 as a birthday gift for my Dad. The backlighting was so poor he could not see the menus to work with it. It did not display any camera cards he put into it, but that could have been the same display problem. He could not figure out how to adjust the display. I have called Pacific Digital but each time they called back when I was out so we have not yet spoken about it. If we can't get in contact soon we will return it to [...](which was a little cheaper than Amazon) and try again. Stay tuned."
1,got wrong item!,"I ordered this tool thinking it had needlenose pliers... which was pictured.. what i received were the blunt nose pliers, which are completely useless for the work I do. To save myself even more headache I just gave them away as a gift instead of going through all the hassle of returning it. I guess Amazon is still one of those online stores that you just cant buy anything specific or important from. The cheaper price does not outweigh the headache of receiving the wrong product"
2,Model received different from web description,The model I received does not have the carbide insert on the pliers. The box it came with says it is model 07550. There is a sticker that covered this model number and it says it is model 07550G. So I have to return it.I agree with the other review that the black finish does rub off on my fingers. I had a gerber pocket knife and was very happy with it and thought of replacing it with this model. Quite disappointed with it. Gerber surely disappointed me on this one!
3,The skin ripped,"I love the armband, it's perfect. But when I went to charge my player for the first time I wanted to take the skin off so I could see when it was finished (I ordered the black), the skin just ripped, very easily. I would recommend getting a hard skin, if there is such a thing."
2,not what I anticipated,"The armband is great, but the black skin for the mp3 player is terrible. You can't see the light to check battery power, or whether you're on/off. If you get this, go with the clear/white skin!"
4,Nice little armband,This armband does a good job of staying up and keeping the Zen Stone on my arm. All the controls are accessible through precut holes. The only problem I see is that the skin hides the LED that indicates if the unit is on.
4,Zen Armband,Band works great the only thing I don't like is that you are not able to see the on/off spot.
4,Other uses.,I attached my headlamp to it then put it on my bicycle helmet.This strap is of good thick quality but the velcro closure is short in length.The rubber Zen Mp3 player skin is thin.I don't expect it to take much wear and tear or abuse and is not watertight.
2,LOOK INWARD (BEFORE YOU LEAP),"I've used this system twice. Once it worked as advertised. The other time it totally screwed up my system. The difference might be that on the successful use, I chose the Select All on the menu of files and settings to transfer. On the disastorous usage, I checked individual program files. Worst of all, Detto customer support was completely useless, ignorant, and unreliable (not returning calls etc).LOOK INWARD XP USERS: This might all be solved by Microsoft. XP comes with a file and settings transfer program. Not sure exactly how it stacks up vs. Detto product, but I will try the XP program before messing with the Detto program again. Bottom line: a lot of money for a USB cord."
1,Keep your money,"After trying this program 10 times, I still have not managed to migrate my files to the new computer. Paid extra for the USB version of this program, and all I can say, is keep your money. We've had numerous problems with the connection being broken during transfer, which leaves no option other than to start over again. There is no way to resume the transfer after it has stopped. Over 12 hours later, still trying to transfer the files"
1,Waste of Money,"For the cost of this product, go out and buy your own parallel or USB cable and use the FREE Windows Files and Settings transfer wizzard. It will save you money and do the exact same thing."
5,Pleasant surprise,"I'm not a tech-savvy guy. Usually these types of products don't work for me, but surprise, surprise. This worked as advertised. I set up the software on both machines (Dell 5100 laptop w/ Windows XP to Dell E510 w/ XP), hit ""ok"" and went to dinner with my wife. I returned a little over an hour later and my new computer looked like my old computer. I use these computers for work and I have a lot of data on them. I spent over an hour reviewing everything and I didn't see anything it missed (except for a few empty folders). Even Outlook was configured just like it was before. I paid $18 for this a few days ago. Great investment."
1,Nothing Intelligent About This Product,"Don't even bother. I tried to use this to move data from a Windows 98 PC to a new Windows XP PC at my home and couldn't get the PC's to communicate via the parallel ports. After 3 days of this, I ended up buying an external Zip drive and manually moved the data myself. Save your money and try another product. This wasn't just a waste of money, but a big waste of time."
3,Disapointed for Blu-ray,"Just purchased a Blu-ray player and this ""HD concert"" and was VERYDisapointed in the quality as with other reviews.Very grainy and poor HD for a Blu-ray release.There should be a disclaimer on the DVD that says, ""not in original HD""This HD show looks like an ""up converted 480i"" show.Thinking about returning it."
4,Great performance,"I agree with others here with respect to the video quality however, I think it has less to do with 1080i versus 1080p and more to do with the filtered light, fog machines and camera white level limitations in a darkened Albert Hall. Unless this DVD is only available in Blu Ray I would pick it up in a standard 480p video format and save some money. The Dolby 5.1 production is first rate regardless of the video format. I buy mostly music DVDs and very few movies since I can rent them anytime. If you are starting an HD library and trying to decide whether to go Blu Ray or HD/DVD this DVD may help you decide."
2,Phenomenal Blu-Ray Best viewed with your eyes closed.,"The music and performance were flawless. Simply sublime! This disc will definitely show off your Dolby TrueHD and make your ears happy. Crank it up and enjoy!The video, however, was perhaps the worst concert footage I've EVER seen. The lighting may have worked great for a live event, but it was absolutely wrong for video. A very large percentage of this concert is completely un-watchable. The stage is washed out in blues and reds. You can't see much of anything most of the time. Filming this concert was obviously an after thought. It had the potential to be so great, but it goes down as an ""epic fail"".This is one DVD or Blu-ray that is best enjoyed as audio only. Turn off the projector or tv and just put on your headphones and slip into audio ecstasy."
2,Blu-Ray with a poor image.,"I like to see David Gilmour playing the music of Pink Floyd but I'm very impressive with the great sound but the poor image in many moments of the concert. So, I don't recommend this Blu-ray."
4,SOUNDS GREAT----LOOKS OKAY,"The audio is great. The video is okay. Don't get me wrong, some close ups show a lot of details, but I think the smoke and lighting(or lack thereof-some dark scenes) is the main reason the image looks soft overall. I am still VERY happy with the set and would recomend it to others."
5,Highly Recommended,"This Blu-ray isn't perfect. The flaws? A lot of smoke used in their show detracts from blu-ray perfect video quality.Wah. Nick Mason would have been nice to see. Boo-hoo. And it's rather bitter-sweet knowing this is my last really good look at Richard Wright before his death. RIP, Rick, we'll miss you.Those gripes aside, this is 6 hours of Gilmour/Pink Floyd bliss. As other reviewers have noted seeing Gilmour & Wright doing Echoes is worth the price of purchase all by itself. Same with Astronomy Domaine. I've always loved Gilmours guitar. 'Soaring' has always been the word I use to describe his wonderful skill. A 2.5 hour concert with 3.5 hours of extra songs, documentaries, etc.Well worth the price & I'll probably grab this blu-ray over the Pulse dvd when I need my Pink Floyd fix."
3,"Some Great Cuts, But...","Having seen Gilmore in concert, it was fun to remember it when we saw the DVD. There are some terrific cuts, but the ""new"" songs and the acoustic numbers were forgetable. Never a good sign when you have to skip songs before they end to see if you like the next one better. My thing is that if you buy Gilmore music or go to see him play live, you go to see or hear his searing/tasty electric solos against the base line and synthesizer. You don't go to see him break out his acoustic guitar. There is just enough of the good stuff on this DVD to make it worth buying."
3,Warning this disc i s coded for Region A Players only,A warning for all customers who do not own a region A Player.This disc is coded for Region A Players only and will not play onRegion B or C Players
2,THe audio levels are poor,I think David Gilmour is a real talent and this performance bears that out. Unfortunately whoever mastered thisDVD couldn't be bothered to keep the audio levels constant. It seems every time the performance starts to take offthe audio level drops down considerably and takes the energy out of the songs. It ruins a stellar performance.It sounds like a monkey is handling on the faders in the mix. Though that's not fair to monkeys. It's a real shame.
2,A bit flat...,I'm a huge Floyd/Gilmour/Waters fan... have seen all the various iterations live many times etc. But this two-disc set felt dead to me... surprisingly there are a number of subtle flubs on Gilmour's part too. Not used to that in the perfectionist Floyd performances. It felt to me as if it was just phoned in. Gilmour's performance felt quite devoid of any real passion... I'm quite glad I just went with the Netflix on this one versus actually buying it as I've done in the past with any/all Floyd live videos.
3,Great audio but the video is a mess!,"I absolutely love Pink Floyd and all of their fine DVDs and albums, but this item was a bit of a disappointment for me, all because of the heavy use of smoke, color, and bright lights that washed away my ability to get a clear view of the musicians' performances. The horrible use of excessive lights and smoke simply ruined it for me. The tags on the package emphasized the use of HD cameras for the video - I don't know why they even bothered.If you can ""look past"" the shoddy video, the audio & overall concert performance is very good.But if great video is important, pass this one up and get ""David Gilmour in Concert"" or ""Pulse"" instead."
4,A whole lot of fine Music,A whole lot of fine Music played expertly by one of my favorite guitar players at the top of his form with an impeccable band. Sensitive and joyful A very well spent $25
4,Onward & Upward,"I just loved the way this DVD was put together. So thoughtfully done.One thing that did bother me way the way that DG has accepted his wealth. (Remember MONEY!) Other than that...the uncomfortable meeting with RW. Better audio would have been great there, but I was left with the impression that they really wouldn't have wanted me to hear what they said to each other...so why put it in? To show that they won't kill each other whenever they meet?Anyway. DG is a man among men. He isn't trying to be PF, he just moves on. And, why not have your old buds play with you, if they can?Give me more!Dave"
5,Great Concert!!! David Gilmour Is Awesome!!!,"This concert is absolutely incredible and loaded with spectacular bonus features. David's ""On An Island"" material and all the ""Pink Floyd"" tunes are AMAZING! Compared to PULSE, I really like this concert better, even though PULSE was awesome. Every song is incredible. My favorites are not only The Dark Side Of The Moon tunes, but ""Coming Back To Life"" was my favorite. David's guitar work is killer and the concert gets better and better. The special guest appearances were a great selection (from David Crosby, Graham Nash, Robert Wyatt, to David Bowie, etc, they were great in their roles). I liked the camera shots of David's fingers moving across the fretboard and just all the camera shots in general. Even the quality of the picture and sound on this DVD is more than great, it felt like I was watching this on blu-ray. For anyone who is a Pink Floyd and/or David Gilmour fan, definately buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed. It will rock your world."
3,Great concert - if the disc actually works . . .,"I'm going to write a quick ""buyer beware"" review of this on.1. The content itself is impeccable. The live Echoes alone is worth the price of admission. On an Island live is also fantastic. This is the best live Floyd related release ever. Better than Pulse. Better than Roger's DVD. The music and visuals are that good . . .2. . . . if the disc actually works. Mine doesn't. It's not scratched or anything, but it's failed on two DVD players. It plays just fine till Fat Old Sun. Then it skips like mad. Its unable to play most of Fat Old Sun, any of Coming Back to Life, or the first half of High Hopes. And looking on a few message boards, I'm not the only one with this problem."
4,David Gilmour Remeber that night,"Surely the best Floyd live item ever! The fact that Echoes is fully played is worth the money spent. And, on top of that, there's Wots.. from the lost treasure album Obscure by clouds (I wish there were more pieces from that album recorded live). Rick Wright is playing better than ever. The best was to find, amidst the bonus material, an acoustic version of Echoes (unfortunately not the complete piece, only the second part of it, but still a pleasant surprise). I just don't give it a 5-star rate because of the excess of stuff like High Hopes and the like. No doubts left on which one is Pink."
5,Simply amazing!!!,"David Gilmour is in truly fantastic form for this concert. I watched from start to finish the minute I got it out of the packaging! Great sound and picture and some good close-ups of David playing his various guitars like the master that only he can be. I absolutely loved Fat Old Sun, SOYCD with Crosby and Nash and Comfortably Numb with David Bowie. But Echoes topped it for me. That was stellar indeed! As far as OAI goes...I loved hearing and seeing it performed live in its entirety. When I first listened to the entire CD I thought it was good. Seeing it actually performed live really shed a different light on it. I consider it to be some of David's best solo work.This is really a fantastic DVD. From the concert to the extras, it's a must for any Gilmour/Floyd fan."
5,i love everything David Gilmour,I now have everything he's done !And I'm really glad he won the lawsuit just finished.This concert was rather gentler than the Pulse tour concert with morepersonal footage and out-takes. The material was a mix of the old and the newand its really a blast to see half of the Floyd and 2/3 Roxy playing together.The singing is getting a little less piowerful - I mean the man is in his60's now; but he's still quite wonderful.It also makes you curious as to what else he has lying around in that studio of his.Its a shame Richard Wright is gone - it will never be quite the same if he'snot there. Whatever though - I will always want more: the man is inspired!!!!
4,Gilmour,"Great sound recording and a wonderful night of great music. Mostly new songs, but a few of the pink floyd tunes done very well. Some great behind the scenes clips.Some of the best musicians in the world having a good night."
