2,CAN YOU SPELL PREDICTABLE?,"The story of an 18 year old youth who joins the Danish resistance movement and aids the British after he learns of how the Germans are utilizing radar to track and destroy British planes.The ""color by numbers"" quality of the plot is not helped by the character's dialog which is, at times, almost laughable. Follet seems to be coasting on his reputation. How many authors could get away with having a plane explode when one of the characters on the ground throws a lit cigar at the fuselage?The book is probaly good for an airplane ride but if you are looking for something a little meatier go back and reread Follet's Eye Of A Needle ot The Pillars Of The Earth."
4,Classic Follet,"Hornet Flight, continuing in the strong tradition of Jackdaws, is a compelling story set in WWII. The story is set in the UK and Denmark in the early part of the war. Denmark has been occupied by the Germans and the citizens are unsure how to at and react. A nascent resistance is at the center of the story, with the Allies desperate to determine how the Nazis are shooting down so many planes. A sense of urgency is increased at the Germans begin their run into Russia. The British must improve their air effort to string out the war and extend the Germans. Hornet Flight is an impressive, fast-paced tale of espionage, full of intrigue, twists, turns and surprises that are classic Follet. The reader is presented with interesting cast of characters that you will come to love and hate. Once you start reading, it will be difficult to stop."
4,Sputtering start - Reasonable finish,"I am a fan of this author and was a bit disappointed with the begining of this novel. It got bogged down in many things, but that may have been necessary for the development of the novel which was essentially an espionage tale. Once it got going it was more readable and enjoyable and I would encourage people who like this author to give it a try. Not a ringing recomendation, I know, but an honest evealuation."
2,very average,"This work by Follett left me feeling a little cheated. While a good enough read, I felt the overall story was rather too simple and a little unbelievable. Characters are not fully enough developed. Anyone who has more than the most basic understanding of WWII history will feel a little insulted by the way situations and references are too obviously spelled out. For me, in this genre, Alan Furst is a much more entertaining and stimulating use of my time."
3,Follet's Flight of Fancy,"Hornet Flight is an interesting and entertaining Ken Follett spy thriller WWII tale. Several characters are well developed, leaving the reader sad or perhaps relieved when one or more predictably dies in the course of the war time novel.The story is simple but believable and does not require the reader to completely ignore history to enjoy the book. The length of the paperback is 500 + pages and provides hours of escape to a time most readers are glad they never lived.This book is definitely not Follet's most detailed or intense, but well worth reading if you enjoy war novels, spy thrillers with light romance.3 Stars"
2,AMATEURISH EFFORT,"Since a few other reviewers have rehashed the plot of this novel, I won't get into the specifics of it. I just want to say that it is not a very good one. It breezes along like an old Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew story---amazing coincidences popping up everywhere, stilted dialogue slipping from every character's tongue, and action sequences which are unrealistic to the point of being downright silly.Years ago, Follett wrote three great action/suspense novels: Eye of the Needle, The Key to Rebecca, and Triple. If you want to be enjoyably entertained and save some money to boot, buy these novels in paperback. Don't waste twenty bucks on Hornet Flight."
4,Hornet Flight by Ken Follett,It is difficult for Ken Follett to write a bad book. This is one of his usual thrilling novels. I did not love it simply because of the state of mind that I am under at present. Maybe my attention span is short or something. It did not easily keep my attention where I could not put down most of his novels. I could put this one down and pick it up later. It was still a good story. Maybe more tension would have helped. It still could be me right now.
5,Loved this book,This book is for young and old alike who love adventure and flying. I learned more about the hornet aircraft. This would make a great adventure movie.
4,Ken does it again.,This was the usual Follett book about spying and WWII. Yet it is fast paced and well written. I recommend it highly. Need I say more?
4,MY REVIEW OF HORNET FLIGHT,"After not reading books for 20 years, I bought a Kindle Fired ND and AND STARTED looking for books I might enjoy. I selected this book because of its setting near World war 2. I FOUND THIS BOOK BOTH INTERESTING AND BELIEVABLE. I would purchase another book similar to this one."
3,Not too bad,"Contains the usual good attention to detail and facts that makes Follett a good author. However, again, way too much unnecessary explicit sex."
4,"Hornet Flight, an easy and good read","In early WWII, with Denmark occupied and Great Britain suffering devastating losses, unlikely Danish heroes step up risking all for freedom. Germany is on the cutting edge of radar, baffling the RAF command. Espionage, family rivalries, deceit, young love, and a little science weave their way through this easy read.There is something for everybody in this book...And, there are pages and pages of exciting flight that can be experienced and felt through Follett's words.R.M. Gallagher"
2,Not Vintage Follett,"I've read almost everything Follett has written, but this is not one of his better books. It's tedious and unbelievable. I found noone to root for and only kept reading in hopes that it would get better. Sadly it did not. The story, character and dialogue just doesn't work and the payoff is a snooze."
1,Hornet Flight,"It's hard to believe Ken Follett could write a book this amateurish. It reads more like his first rather than his latest. The sentences are simple; basic statements are explained; the situations rather simplistic. The storyline is credible; the characters are not...much too naive. It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote The Eye of the Needle; The Key to Rebecca; The Pillars of the Earth (which I loved) and many other really fine books.If you must read it, check it out at the library and save your money for his next book. Hopefully, he'll return to his former style."
3,Promising Story but a Fizzler in the End,"Hornet Flight has a lot going for that makes for a potent story:, courage and sacrafice, love and hate, loyalty and revenge, human ingenuity, a cerebral teen becomes a hero and gets the girl, World War II espionage, beautiful and spirited women, faustian choices, portraits of life in occupied Denmark, a small education on radar and night fighters, and nasty Nazis and collaborators. Follett builds a compelling plot worthy of a World War II epic such as Where Eagles Dare or Heroes of Telemark, but then seems to be in a hurry wrap things causing the aftertaste of Hornet Flight's ending sequence to be like cotton candy. This is far from a bad book and I will recommend it to my teenage son for vacation reading. However, Hornet Flight is light fare that is good book for a plane or beach, but one that will leave one's consciousness shortly after completion."
3,Entertaining,"This is a fun book to read. If you allow yourself, you'll be swept away by the plot. For me it was a fast read. It was addictive almost in the way a soap opera is. You want to find out what happens next, but don't expect much depth to the characters. Certainly their histories are given and their emotions are reported, but it has about as much reality to it as a read-back by a court reporter.If you want a fun light easy adventure book, this is a good one. It's easy to get caught up in the plot but it's unlikely that you'll be sucked in to the point where the characters seem real to you; you'd have to suspend a lot more than your disbelief for that."
2,Ken Follett has done much better,"I am a great fan of Ken Follett and his many wonderful books. Unfortunately, Hornet Flight is not one of his better books. It is an ordinary and predictable spy vs. spy story set in World War II Denmark. The characters are one-dimensional people, with unlikely affiliations, and unlikely luck. They get into trouble because of their foolish decisions or bad luck. They rely too often on unlikely good luck to get them out of trouble. The story lacks the intensity, credibility, suspense, rich intrigue, and intricate interconnections between interesting people and events that make his books like Dangerous Fortune and The Pillars of the Earth so special."
5,Excellent read,I had to keep reading it to see what happened next and to whom. It was a break away from the usual Ken Follett.
4,Enjoyable read but too many coincidences,"The book is very well written - the prose flow smoothly, characters and their surroundings are described in rich detail. The story takes place in Denmark during WWII and revolves around the discovery of a German radar installation that is reeking havoc on the British bomber fleet. The British want to know more about the installation and task members of the Danish resistance with the intelligence gathering mission. Of course this intelligence gathering mission doesn't go smoothly as they are being pursued by the Danish police and Germans. The story moves quickly and Follet does an excellent job of building suspense. However, the story contained many coincidences that detracted from its believability. In summary, this is not one of Follet's best novels but it was certainly an enjoyable read."
2,A Belly Flop into Concrete,"This was my first Follet book, and I was somewhat excited to get my hands on it. I had heard of Ken Follet's books, and they seemed to enjoy a wide following.In ""Hornet Flight"", the setting in WW2 Denmark, the characters are well developed and the descriptions are well balanced between the detail and pace. Follet also keeps a reasonable level of tension thoughout the book.And then you reach the middle to the end. What would have been a difficult book even for someone of Follet's skills turns to unadulterated tragedy. The ending is predictable and a disaster, a thorough disappointment after a reasonably good build-up. It seemed shallow and without any real thought or climax. The delay of the flight, (this is after the two main characters slaved and scraped to repair the plane right under the Germans' noses), because of a dance performance was ...well....bad.Despite Follet's obvious skills as a writer, this book can't be among his best work. I would not reccommend it at all."
3,"Not his best, but I still love KEN FOLLETT","Like some of the other reviews, the book is predictable, but follet's writing is just great. he is so easy to read, very enjoyable, i always look forward to his next novel. I heard rumors of a sequel to the pillars of the earth, that would be great."
3,OK Read - Better than average,"This was an OK read. I would recommend it, but not a top list read. One character that was interesting was Peter. He is one evil dude. Also the relationship of Karen and Harold was interesting."
2,Not one of Ken Follett's better efforts...,I bought this book because I thought Pillars of the Earth was so superb. It is almost like this book is written by a different author. It is all a bit far fetched.....
2,Check the DVD price,"Standard Deviants School Trigonometry Module 5: Identities (2009) - this product is listed under the same name in multiple places with variety of prices, so before you buy this DVD have a proper check and get the one which is inexpensive"
4,Easy corner shelf,"This shelf is pretty cool. It was easy to install. I don't know if it would hold 50 lbs. as claimed, but maybe with the enclosed mollies. I wasn't going to put that heavy of an object on the shelf, so I installed it without the mollies and am satisfied with the result.Creative Connectors #6008178 9.5"" Wal Corner Shelf"
5,very sturdy,once i got it in the corner nothing was taking it down! (unless you sat on it!) looks very nice too. well worth it!
3,Spoiler: It's the same thing.,This 5 book series is the same as the first. After reading the first books I was really hoping for something as original and interesting out of the next set. These books fell short in my opinion.
1,"tedium at its most tedious, repetition as its most repetitious","This series has all the nuance of an episode of Scooby Doo.'Epic' fantasy this is not. In fact this hardly qualifies as light entertainment. The sitcom-variety light banter and unfunny jokes that repeat endlessly are enough to numb your mind into a slumber at best, at worst it will have you feeling remorse for the time you spent reading this. Cardboard-cutout characters, paper-thin plotting, and endless insults to his readers intelligence makes this Eddings at his worst. It's no wonder he started on a new series before even finishing this one. I would have too, there just isn't anything left in this one and it's painfully obvious by the beginning of the second volume that it is going nowhere."
5,Relax and enjoy it.,"Eddings writes mindless drivel, but it is ENTERTAINING mindless drivel - great for telling the world to go soak its head and just sitting back and having a good time."
1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK,The Belgariad is a nice set of books. DO NOT READ THE MALLOREON. It is trite and painful to read. Willful suspension of disbelief became impossible and I resent the time I spent reading it.
5,"Excellent, but.....","Read ""The Belgariad"" first. Most excellent epic fantasy from a relatively newer author. I started as a kid with Robert E. Howard and Edgar Rice Burroughs. This author and his works will not disappoint you. Cheaper to get these as ""The Belgariad"" and ""The Mallorean"" than as 5 individual books each."
1,Not that good,"Doesn't take any less time to move the iron standing up as compared to placing it on the rest. And after ironing, stupid me grabbed the iron rest to put it away and burned the heck out of my hand!!"
5,Rave Reviews,"I bought this for my father as a Christmas gift. Although I did not see or sample it, he loved it. He said it came beautifully presented and that everything was delicious."
3,Lovely Illustrations...,"Baroness Blixen was a lovely and fascinating writer, yet the text of this book doesn't shed much light on her daily life on her beloved Danish homestead. But, photos of Frau Blixen's flower arrangements and few of the Rungestedlund itself are worth the price...a picture is worth 1000 words (sometimes).Sweet gift for the Blixen admirateurs."
1,Do Not Recommend!,"I wanted to save money as we were very short on cash. Our groomer said our dog had evidence of tapeworm (she used to be a Vet Assistant). So we thought we could go to Amazon to find something online and save a trip to the Vet. What I strongly disliked about the product was that there were no REAL instructions included on how to use the product (i.e., how much per weight of dog, how often..). I was able to research and figured out how to use the product with some guesswork.. however, I gave it to my dog only once and it did NOT work. She is still demonstrating symptoms. I will take her to the Vet anyhow, so I really didn't save any money."
4,Action Movie!,"I wish I could get this movie on a DVD. It's shot in and around Waco, Texas. It's not exactly a hit movie but it is very campy and funny."
2,Buggy!,"I played SpiderMan, the other game by Activision in this category, and was impressed. When I heard this game was out, I nearly jumped on it at $29.99. After installation, it crashed no less than 6 times IN A ROW! I have a 1.5 GHz processor, 7.3 gigs of free space, and an Nvidia graphics and video card. Spiderman, C&C Generals, and a bunch of other games run great. Overall, the gameplay was poor because you had to rotate the camera every 2.3 seconds, and I couldn't get past the first 30 seconds of the first level without a crash. Thanks a lot Activision!"
2,Not Pleased,"Just installed yesterday on 4.3 Silverado. Does not sound good at all. well maybe on idle it does other than that your just another v6'er who tried to sound like a v8. the only reason I gave 2 stars was for amazon on the shipping, thats about it. V6 Silverado owners, listen to V8 owners, dont put a exhaust on a V6 truck you wont be happy.Costs: $90 for mufflerInstall: $70Cost of taking flowmaster off and installing OEM Muffler: 120What a mistake."
4,A good How-To book with patterns and templates,"Forty-six patchwork patterns with templates and 12 quilting patterns are the heart of this book. Including most of the popular traditional patterns , such as 'Ocean Waves, 'Bear's Paw,' 'Shoo Fly,' and 'Double Irish Chain.' The template are easy to copy and accurate. Suzy Lawson also includes and interesting chapters on Amish quilt colors, border, and backing and binding. Set in typescript so it is sometimes difficult to read, but full of information and the price can't be beat."
5,Vi3's CD was worth the wait!,"their cd ranges from pop, hip-hop, to r&b. It is a classic overall cd that is worth the money, i would even be willing to pay more!"
3,SO TIGHT... or is it?,Vi3 put out a good effort. For this is a pop record trying to hard to be more hip-hop. On tracks a ''hottie with a body'' and ''oh no'' as personal favorites bring little hip-hop. This isolated attempt of hip-hop is a little disappointing. ''Eyes closed so tight'' is what the track that best shows what this is cd is all about.
3,Video better than song,"I saw the video prior to listening to the single alone. The video is better than the song. I proceeded to buy the enhanced import CD because I liked the video so much. The only problem was that I wasn't able to view the video for some reason. I tried it on my DVD player and laptop. I played the song out in two days. Hopefully, the album will have some good songs. If not, then I would pass on purchasing the album. Christina Milian is like a mixture of J.Lo and Beyonce."
1,Dip It Low,"Disgusting. What kind of a role model is this? The lyrics, the music video... everything thing about the girl is slutty. I'm 12 and I think this is wrong. Come on."
2,What Happened?,"Christina Milian is so talented, did she really have to ""Dip It"" this low? Her vocals in the Kim Possible theme song were good, as well as in the re-mix. But this? I can't stand ""Dip It Low""! The first time I heard it, I grew impatient in waiting for it to end. Her voice is so annoying! She sounds like she's whining! And the lyrics are so...disgusting. You know what, CHRISTINA is disgusting! Just see the music video for ""Dip It Low"", and you'll know what I mean."
2,"Christina, what have you done?","I liked her in the AM to PM days, but this song leaves me wondering if I should buy her album or not. I have heard this song a few times and some of the lyrics annoy me. It's a good dance song, but to me, it gets really old really, really fast."
5,Christina Can Sing,"Christina Put Ashanti and J.lo To Shame This song really shows Christina singing, her voice is great just as Great as the song I love dip It Low it is so Hot."
1,Total waste of time and money,"Book info: I read the 1st edition that was published in 1993.Pre required knowledge or literature: NoneGeneral: The book is hard to read, every topic it handles it immediately goes deep into the subject, therefore you lose trackBook content:In my opinion when talking about benchmarking you are looking e.g. at a process what you want to compare in performance with a standard or reference (process). You would say that ways of quantifying performance of a process for example OEE would be explained in this book, but it isn't. Therefore you get crap like ""Section 8: Assessing Quality Maturity"" (17% of book) and section 9: ""A Bibliography of benchmarking literature"" (9%) Appendixes (9%) etc. The book handles everything from a management perspective e.g. how to convince management; calculating costs of benchmarking; project management related issues; basically everything around benchmarking project and therefore forgetting the import issue itself BENCHMARKING."
3,"Great Graphics, same old gameplay.","This third chapter in the Guild Wars saga has brilliant graphics, interesting story-line, and great new options including a new interaction with heroes. The game is the same as the other two chapters in that a character runs around different maps and kills things. Nothing really new from the previous two games."
4,bead97's Nightfall review,"This is our third Guild Wars purchase and we're still very pleased with story line and the overall scope of each release. There's enough content to keep up interested for months and the ability to smoothly travel between ""continents"" adds a nice sense of continuity. Some other nice features are the seeming lack of hacks and not having to wait in a queue to enter the game or change locations"
5,Great case,I have the smaller version of this case for my Nokia N75 and I love it. I had a case previously that came off my belt while I was on my motorcycle and my phone was destroyed. I never worry about this case coming off. I recently got the Samsung Captivate and have been looking all over for a good case. I had no idea that they made this in different sizes.
4,"Seriously, 'people',it's hot!","when I saw it was a Toca compilation,I knew it was going to be 'heavy'!Personally,one of my favourite tracks is 'introspective' by Cormega,he is simply too smooth.Capicu also 'kills' it on track 5..Then there is Nature flowing at his best...I could go on and on,but if you like that 'real flavour',go 'cop' it,you would not be disappointed!"
4,WOW!,"I have to say I have never purchased any jewelry off of the internet so to say I was weary is an understatement. However, once I recieved the watch I was pleasantly surprised. It works, it's beautiful and my dad thought I was fantastic by purchasing him this present. He gets compliments every day he wears it....this is a must buy!!"
1,Broke Quickly,"Length:: 3:33 MinsI got this watch as a graduation gift from my wife. I started wearing it the day of commencement (April 2). I wore it daily under normal circumstances at work (I do administrative work) and around the house. On May 12th the self winding mechanism inside the watch broke. It's possible I got a bad watch, the buyer will need to take that bet.Other than it's brokenness the watch is very nice. Stunning piece and works well with a business look. Overall I'm please, now if it would just tell time.UPDATE:Took the watch to a repair shop, said it wasn't worth fixing because the repair would be about 400 dollars. Clocksmith said he sees this all the time, quick crafted watches sell cheap for a quick buck. Turns out the box it came in is higher quality than the watch."
5,F117 poster,The Nighthawk is one of the coolest UFO looking military jets the poster arrived fast it was inexpensive & a decent size it goes great w my plane die cast collection
5,great knee support !,I have used this support with great success. Easy to apply and comfortable to wear. Best of all it is very reasonable to obtain
3,Returning these,"I have problems with both knees and have worn traditional knee straps for a long time. I needed some new ones, so decided to give these a try. I'm returning them - The white portion that holds your knee cap doesn't feel like it stays snuggly in place, they are really bulky (I need to wear them under my pants) and the straps are incredibly itchy and uncomfortable."
3,Kneed-It maybe not...,"With a variety of tears and flaps, and now micro splnters in the knee bone......not sure if this really helps.When one tries to make the 'best' of this kind of situation, it's worth a try"
2,It didn't work and it was uncomfortable,"I brought this product to help with my knee. I have chondromalachia, and struggle a great deal with walking up and down steps of any kind.Unfortunately for me, the product didn't help any. There was a very slight reduction of pain, but the strap used to secure the product in place behind my knee was very uncomfortable and even in the short duration I spent testing it, rubbed quite painfully. I would not have wanted to wear this for very long, and had I done so, would have feared that I might have developed sores behind my knee or other skin irritation.I don't know if other buyers would definitely have the same problems I experienced. Perhaps my knee was just a bit too big to fit comfortably (normally I wear an extra large size knee brace), and perhaps my chondromalachia is a bit too severe for this product to do any good. Others might have better luck."
4,Rodillera rotuliana,Muy ergonomica se la puede utilizar a diario sin ninguna molestia tanto en la rutina del dia a dia como en el momento de realizar actividad fisica
4,No more Copats for me,This works better than the regular copat on my knee during physical activity. I would recommend it to anyone.
3,Satisfied,"After going through the reviews of other products I finally decided that this was the one I wanted. I was so excited when I got it and to try it out. I usually go jogging in the mornings.The belt DOES fit real comfortably. It's a really great design, but my CD player was a little too small I guess, so when jogging, the music stopped and re-started when I walked. I'll have to add my own extra padding. But don't be disheartened with my review. Overall it's a really cool bag. Pretty strong. A great buy if you just want a bag to hang out or do routine walking exercise with. The only prob was my sexy slim player, so be sure yours is big enough before you buy the bag."
3,Tough to close,"It takes 20-30 seconds just to zip or unzip the thing. As I pull on the zipper, it bunches up in front, so I have to pull it taut from behind or the zipper can't move. Disappointing. I guess that's the hazard of buying online/unseen."
3,decent to fair,"Not quite as much fun as The Fractal Experience, but from the mathematical standpoint it does a fair job developing the infinite images."
4,Love the book,"Beautifully written about one woman`s destiny. Great story, great characters, one of the best french writers. She had big expectation but life and people killed her hopes. Still, she never lost spirit, I don`t think. Stronglyrecommend"
4,A must-have for banjo players,"The sheer amount of information in this book is worth many times the purchase price. Janet lays out a huge number of great fill-in rolls, tag endings, etc. Then she takes you step-by-step through developing your own arrangement of each song. After learning the tunes from this book, you will be free of ""tab-slavery"" and will be able to learn a melody, and put your own rolls together and make the song your own.I can't say enough about this book. My only complaint is that it is not long enough. C'mon, Janet, get vol 2 out there!"
4,Christmas gift,"I got this for my banjo playing wife for Christmas. Don't know how good it is, but going by other reviews it seems to be one of the better ones."
2,Don't actually put heavy things in this,"This does not use a solid axle for the rear wheels. Putting a couple of gallons of Milk, or a 12 pack of soda and other groceries in it cause the back wheels to splay out and eventually they will come off. Using cotter pins would prevent this and a solid axle is really a must."
2,Poor quality,"Poor quality overall. Back wheels would splay out, like you would expect under heavy load, while cart was empty. Overtightening bolts to try to correct this strips and breaks the nut, so wheels then fall off. Cart also does not fold/unfold squarely - the metal grid gets off-kilter."
3,flimzy,"It helps to have something like this around the house, but its not built to last really. The way the wires and wheels are attached together make it seem like it's going to fall apart. I've used it only once so far and already one wire popped out - I had to bend it back in shape to pop it back in - I guess it's fine if you only use it for very light stuff. And yes, it does smell like gasoline! (3 stars: one for being handy, one for being foldable, and one for the price)"
2,PRETTY ON THE SURFACE,THIS CART LOOKS NICE WHEN CONSTUCTED. THE HANDLE GIVES IT A SHARP LOOK. HOWEVER SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT IN THE DESIGN STAGE. THE CLOSED CAP STYLE NUTS FOR THE FRONT WHEELS TEND TO COME OFF IN USE. A LOCKING NUT FOR THE FRONT WHEELS WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER CHOICE. THE BACK WHEELS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SERVED BY ONE INDEPENDANT AXLE RATHER THAN TWO SEPERATE AXLE SYSTEMS. ON MY CART THE SECOND REAR WHEEL CAME OFF AND WILL HAVE TO BE REATTACHED USING A NEW ASSEMBLY FOR THE WHEEL OR I WILL HAVE TO REDESIGN THE AXLE SYSTEM ENTIRELY. THIS WILL FINALY BE A PRACTICAL CART AFTER A QUICK TRIP TO A HARDWARE STORE AND ANOTHER UNDERTIMINED AMOUNT OF MONEY. IN THE MEAN TIME I WILL HAVE TO DO WITH THE CART I BOUGHT FROM ANOTHER SELLER WITH ANOTHER SELLING SERVICE.
5,laundry cart,It is great for getting my laundry to the laundry room and back without putting such strain on my back as carrying a laundry basket
3,folding cart,The product seemed ok except it was minus some parts. Had to wait for product to be shipped again to get the parts. Then decided it was to big to fit into our car trunk which made it totally useless to us. So we shipped all of it back to Amazon.
3,Questionable product,I bought the Polder 30210-95 shopping/laundry cart and assembled it myself only to discover that one wheel was always lopsided. I had the maintenance man to reassemble it and it again became lopsided or bent in.I reported this to Amazon who sent another one which I paid for again. This time I had the maintenance man assemble it alone. And again one of the wheels is lobsided. There is something wrong with this product and should be reported to the manufacturer.
1,Not Recommended - didnt even last me a month,"This cart looked fine when it arrived (and I did not notice a stench). However, the wheels are atrocious. Both sets fall off all of the time, and the do not roll well. Have the time the hind wheels slip out, and the metal piece bends, forcing the wheels to fold underneath the cart. I cannot push it most of the time because the front wheels skid, so I have to tip it on the two hind wheels and pull the cart. VERY EMBARRASSING on the elevator in my building when this thing is actually falling apart while standing still. Better to spend a few extra dollars on something that is sturdy and reliable."
1,junk,"I was extremely disappointed with this cart. First, I had returned one cart because the wheels wouldn't stay on and the bolts seemed to have been stripped. The second cart went together fine, but the wheels have fallen off both sides and the entire thing is very flimsy. I thought thtat this was a good ""middle-of-the-line"" cart, but it was definitely not worth the money."
3,"Great Cart, terrible smell.","The cart works great, but the petroleum smell is nearly unbearable. Even after 2 months, the things reeks like a diesel pump spill. If you have a back room or similar setup to store this smeller, go for it. Otherwise, think about another cart."
1,Should have read the reviews,"I always read the reviews, why did I?This is another poor quality product from China, the instructions are terrible and the bolts dont fit, they are too long.UghAnd it was $32?!?!?"
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I purchased this cart at Target and had to exchange it within one week as I lost one of the wheels in the parking lot and didn't realize it was missing until I entered our building! Someone found the ""missing"" wheel and left it in the lobby.The front wheels of the 2nd cart ""shredded"" and finally fell off completely some time ago; but even though we bought a different cart from a hardware store, my husband hated to acknowledge defeat and had been using the disabled cart to load groceries from the car. I finally got rid of the cart away and got a new one."
1,damaged goods,the only thing that i liked was a quick shipment. item arrived damaged and had to be repaired to operate. item had a bolt missing.the only reason it wasnt returned was my lack of patients.
1,very poorly made,"It's a waste of money. The minute I opened the box, I was sorry that I paid for it. it needs assembly but this was not the bad part. the bad part was that one of the wires that holds the 2 levels from underneath snaped and broked right when i opend it. so the cart lost it's balance and it's unusable.I would not recomend this product to anyone."
2,Didn't realize that this was like Pepto Bismol. Tastes really really bad,"If you think this is like Aloe juice with some added items to further help smooth your stomach, you are wrong. This tastes like pepto bismol and can only be taken in small doses and if you have a strong disposition. I will try it for a bit and see if it works but boy does it taste terrible."
2,Only a little redeeming value.,"The author, inventor of a fluid pump, makes some good points, especially about manufacturing products, but is usually so general as to be worthless. Since this is an older book it is generally out of date with the times of fax machines, PC publishing and marketing, and the internet. Worth looking at but I would bet your livelihood this book will help make you millions."
2,not worth it,Out of 5 Cr's I only got about one. Cd worth for my money. This box-set seems to have been assembled by the corporate music industry intent on homogeneity and filler. Better to buy selected albums issued in her life-time.Some songs poorly chosen ike a short version of Bravo le Clown when the full version was one of her classics. Like-wise a rushed version of Mon Legionnaire which was made to be a slow song of devotion.Thankfully there are no winded ones done in a recording studio since she loved singing to a live audience.She had an ear for a true melody and then she put heart and soul into it. Eternelle is a complilation of one after another of her classics. I can only suppose being an instition demanded new repotoires and there were not enough talented and original song-writers to keep up with her public. The French would have loved any thing she did which is probably the cause and they tend to have a homogeneous taste in music of which she was an out-standing exception.
1,A difficult read,"I do not like this book. I would not recommend it to anyone. I love to read, fiction and non-fiction. This is one of the worst written books I have ever tried to read. The author will take an entire chapter to defend one thought. Too boring."
3,"The look was good ... the feel, was not.","I liked the look of this volleyball and so did the other members of the team. However, the ball was too hard to play with. Many of our teammates, including myself, had a difficult time practicing with this ball. In my opinion, the design was great--and maybe if we wore gloves it would have been okay."
3,Open Christianity--My Personal Thoughts,"This book contains an interesting way to look at the Christian faith. I disagree personally with some of its concepts. One example of this is the repeated thinking that Jesus was a human being with God consciousness. There are further arguable concepts contained within its pages, which leads me to conclude this is a book about liberal Christianity.It does point out some very good ideas and concepts about the poor however. It also points out the emptiness of having more and more and what is enough. There are also other good points to consider, but I would proceed with caution in reading this book.I recommend this book be read by those who wish to find out more about liberal Christianity or those who can objectionally look at the book and find the good things in to apply to their lives."
3,Two roads diverged in a wood...,"""Open Christianity: Home By Another Road"" is a fairly interesting, quick read of progressive Christianity. Rev. Jim Burklo hardly has the stature of a Marcus Borg (The Heart of Christianity: Rediscovering a Life of Faith) or a Bishop Spong (A New Christianity for a New World: Why Traditional Faith is Dying & How a New Faith is Being Born) His book is basically a compilation of sermon notes. It's very user-friendly and Burklo has a cheerful tone.Burklo discusses ecumenism, making life meaningful, sexuality, whether Jesus is the only way to Heaven. He sees his book as a rebuke to fundamentalist Christianity, but it's lacking in rigor. He's not polemical like Spong, but he's kind of lacking in presentation. ""Open Christianity"" leaves the door open to other possibilities."
3,"Warning, grow a third hand before attempting this installation","Ay carumba! This is the only ironing board holder I could find that would accommodate the Rowenta board that I purchased during a Martha Stewart induced lapse of judgment. This thing assembles, yes, assembles, easily and quickly but doesn't stay assembled through the mounting procedure and kept popping apart on me. Also, as someone mentioned, the crappy wall plugs they include are a joke; I ran out to buy the screw-in wall board plugs and finally got it installed using those. The iron rest is too narrow to hold my iron."
3,Flimsy; inadequate for regular use,"I returned this item because it was flimsy and didn't seem like it would last long. It's probably fine if you only access your ironing board occassionally, and have it stowed where it won't be bumped or hit. It's not good for a long-term solution though."
3,Fine for a temporary measure,"I figure we'll use this for some years until we decide to go with a fold-up wall mounted ironing board. For that purpose, it's fine. My chief complaint is with the included screws. They are not long enough to reach the anchors through the tubing."
3,"Just like it looks, but....",The holder works well for both my ironing board and my iron. However installation was a bear.They only provide the old-school wall anchors that you have to drill pilot holes for in the sheet rock. For a little more they could have included the new style wall anchors that you just screw directly into the wall and then screw the mounting screw directly into that anchor. It would have saved me the frustration and an eventual trip to the hardware store.
5,Great for large Rowenta irons!,Very few iron (and ironing board combo) wall mounts work for the large Rowenta irons. This one does the trick and is sturdy!
5,Great Purchase,"We chose this Iron/Ironing Board holder because our Iron has a retractable cord, with that said the base is too big for most Iron holders, I already bought and returned 2 that were too small for my iron. This one hangs the iron and that is good for a couple reasons. 1) Fits most Iron sizes 2) you can put the iron away while its still hot since the plates don't touch anything. What makes this even better, it's is pretty much the cheapest Iron/Ironing Board holder we could find."
4,Polder Wall mount is ok!,"It is simplicity! It's sturdy, it does it's job and it's not bulky, intrusive or cumbersome! It's a breeze to put together. The only problems I did have with it are, the direction stated that the only thing needed was a screwdriver which is completely false and I guess I can't really fault the company for this but I live in an older place and the wall on which I mounted the rack was wood panel and the anchors that came along with this product don't work for this type of wall. I suppose they assumed everybody had sheet rock. My advice to you DIY'ers out there, know what you're working with! I had a friend bring his screw gun over and he skipped the anchors and put the screws right in by themselves. So far so good! I can open my door all the way and you wouldn't even know the mount is back there. And for the money it is well worth it! I say, go for it!"
5,Just right!,"This ironing board/iron mount is perfect! It is nice and sturdy and was easy to install. I, too, have a larger iron (Oliso) so I needed a place for the iron to rest - this is just right. I have NO idea why other reviewers had a hard time installing this. Very detailed directions, and even a template for marking the screw holes. As always seems to be the case, the screws/anchors that come with it are not adequate - if you have better ones, use them. This thing was practically installed before the UPS driver was out of the driveway - no joke, it took two minutes. Great buy!"
4,Works Well but Assembly is Different,I have an over sized iron and board and this mount works well for both. The assembly is simple but different because the piece doesn't slip together it has a third piece that is placed on the inside. It made me scratch my head why but it works just fine.
5,A GREAT PURCHASE,"I PURCHASED AN OLYMPUS SLIM LEATHER CASE ON SEPTEMBER 4,2008. IT ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS I PURCHASED IT.AND LOOKED BETTER THAN THE PICTURE. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE,AND WILL CONTNUE BEING A CUSTOMER AT AMAZON FOR OTHER ITEMS."
2,Too big.,The case is very big. Why buy a small camera and end up with a big case. The case looks nothing like the picture. The picture is of another case.
3,"Interesting stories, light on research","Coincidentally, I read Pride after reading Authentic Happiness, by Martin Seligman. Pride was filled with stories of various interest highlighting why money isn't always the compelling motivator. While I could relate to many of the examples, I was annoyed with his declarative conclusions based on those anecdotes. Seligman's book, on the other hand, was replete with descriptions of studies relating to the value (and power) of positive emotions (aka happiness). Applying what I learned from Seligman, I found Katzenbach more credible. (And Katzenbach will probably sound more credible in the business environment.)"
4,Interesting...,"The book refers to motivation at work in which the author believes pride plays a key role. Although I do not disagree that pride is one of the most important drivers for motivating the workforce, I figure out further drivers that might produce good results. In his book Carrots and Sticks Don't Work, Paul Marciano provides a number of points that should be examined as to motivate workers. However, it might be possible that pride is the most important motivator.On a broader context, Drive by Daniel Pink is another excellent book that examines what make us move to action."
3,Underwhelmed with the quality,"I was looking for a CD wallet that was soft and compact enough to fit in my car's glovebox. This meets that criteria fine, but quality of the materials used (especially the sleeves for the discs) feels cheap compared to similar products I've used in the past."
1,"Too thin, too hard","Girlfriend said it wasn't even that good for external use either, she's making me order something else."
5,great product,"I didn't buy my first one from Amazon but I know how great it works. After years of having it, it finally broke around the top the other night and the top won't stay screwed on anymore. I knew I would be lost without it so I was excited to see that amazon had the exact same one. My husband will be please as it is great for clitoris stimulation and ideal for the squirter. It is hard and I don't suggest internal use but for the squirters, you squirt pretty much as soon as you turn it on especially at the highest speed. It sounds like a little popsaw to me but it does the job. My husband loves it so the sound doesn't bother us. I just bought one from amazon a few minutes ago and I'm thinking I should have bought two. I absolutely love it!!!"
2,Okay...,"But only just okay. It's too thin, and the plastic is way too hard. Climaxes are attainable, but always of a shallow variety. I'd look elsewhere."
2,This book is ripe with good ideas but is extremely cryptic,"This book was intelligently written -- too intelligently. In fact, I found it unintelligible the first time through. After reading Ake, I was looking forward to reading Soyinka's lectures. To my disappointment, they weren't lectures. They were sermons delivered to a room full of PhDs. If you already know a good deal about Africa and are not afraid to have to read a book two or three times, then this book has some interesting ideas."
1,Heavy propaganda with the occasional fact gotten straight.,"Soyinka has a point to make, and his passion for doing so will not facts nor logic stand in his way. As it turns out, what does prevent him is his own tortured prose. Soyinka ostentatiously displays his vocabulary, but the ""ten dollar words"" are designed to impress us with his intellect, not to communicate clearly. On paper, his thoughts wander about as if suffering from attention deficit disorder. But his meanderings are oh-so Politically Correct, which will explain the praise this book has received."
2,Take A Look !!!,Dont buy this unless you can first consult a trained professional who has both street smarts and a professional fighting record .if your a rookie just dont bother your better off buying krav maga for beginners .I Find these techniques have no military references and i very much doubt you would do much with out some basic easy to follow steps . this book isnt linear it blasts in your face with style not practical uses.In my opinion it is a book full of boasting .
2,a little disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed by this video. I was expecting to see more ordinary people dancing in normal real life setting at least from the 1930s on and not broadway type dancers on a stage with no audience(which to me is very sterile.) Although they are all good dancers,they tend to make most of these dances,that should be typical of their era, somewhat the same (and not reflecting the social context enough.) I am still waiting for a film made perhaps with a collage of footage from films, television and/or even better, real ballrooms,dance halls,etc. with ordinary people dancing. Does such a product exist?"
1,Seemed way too Stiff,"I got a few of these sticks at the hardware store and tried one of them to seal a cracked pike. The putty needs to be kneaded together uniformly but it was so stiff I could hardly do it. It started getting really hot and cured while I was putting it on the pipe. I think I'm going to return the rest of them. They're too stiff. I used RectorSeal pipe repair kit and it came with a much smaller amount of putty but it was very soft compared to this stuff, and I used one hand to knead it. Use gloves as it could get on your hands."
5,"Fast fix, game changer.","I love this stuff! I've just finished building two new plastic brackets to repair the ones I broke on the plastic shroud over my car engine. I've fixed my sunroof tract, my computer power supply cord holder, and just about everything that has broken loose from where it needed to stay. This stuff is a good sedative and tension reliever, just kneed a inch long piece for a few minutes, and find something loose from where it belongs. Pretty soon, you'll have forgotten what you were upset about. Plus, its good exercise.Just buy it, its only six dollars. You'll be glad you did. I'll bet I've saved $500 by not buying the stuff I broke trying to fix something else."
5,A beautiful addition to the table,"This baker will prove a useful addition to any kitchen. The Le Creuset stoneware provides even baking and it goes straight from the oven to the table. The size is a little small and I would have liked a lid, but overall I would definately recommend it. The wide rim makes retrieving this from a hot oven much easier than some of the other bakeware I have been using and I find I am reaching for this little baker more and more."
5,"Love these, want another pair!","If I can find these in another color, I am going to buy them too! I have found them to be both comfortable and durable."
5,Most comfortable thongs!!,"A friend of mine had found these shoes in a shop in New Orleans. After searching around with no success, I found them on Amazon.com (because they have EVERYTHING!!). I am not a big sandal wearer, but I LOVE these. I wear them all the time. Makes me taller also (a definite plus!). Will definitely buy more in the future."
4,Great little bed!,I bought this for my almost 3 yr. old son for a weekend getaway. He loves the bed so much that he wants to sleep on it at home instead of his own bed. The air pump that comes with the bed is great because it not only blows the bed up but also deflates the bed so that you can roll it up and fit it back into the included carrying bag. Another great feature is that it has rolls on each side so your toddler doesn't roll off the bed. The only downside to this product is the size. My son is not big for his age and there is not much room to grow.
5,Ride On!!,"This is not , I feel Alvin's best work, but I love it! Alvin Lee fans will to. Killer guitar, recommend it!"
5,A very insightful biography of a very complex man,"Curt Sampson does us all a good turn with a very well-researched book. It fills a gap in golf history that is difficult to explain -- why has so little been written about such an amazing golfer, one who changed the way we think about the game? I felt a new appreciation for Hogan after reading this, and most serious golfers will too. Cannot recommend too highly"
5,HOGAN,"In my very large golf library this is clearly the best book on golfI have read period. For the first time you get an insight into the ""wie ice mon"" in what reads like a novel."
4,Very Inspiring,"Reading this book makes me want to get out an play golf. His perseverence alone makes me want to get out and accomplish myself. The only thing that bothered me about this book was that it seemed to jump around a little. Other than that, it is definitely a must read!"
4,Solid,"This book really only confirmed what I had thought for a long time, behind Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan was a tremendous golfer who was way ahead of his time. Hogan nearly won the grand slam, and could not compete in the PGA because of the fact it started almost the same time the British Open was finishing. As we all watch Tiger Woods try for the grand slam, let us not forget Ben Hogan who was as close as anyone has ever come to doing it. The most amazing part of Hogan's story was the fact he won the US Open after almost dying in a car crash.Sampson does a nice job with this book, telling about Hogan like he was, stearn and driven, and definitely not writing a fluff piece like some biographies can be. Hogan was tough, and I would equate him as the ""Ted Williams"" of golf, so good it was hard for him to teach anyone because he set such high standards for himself. I recommend this book to golfers and people who want to read about a remarkable man."
5,An inspirational book that will motivate the beginner to pro,"I'm a 17 year old golfer with dreams of becoming a PGA Tour card carrier. After reading this book, I relized I have an easy life and should gives thanks to my mom and dad. With the hardships that Mr. Hogan went through in his childhood, it is hard to beleive how he went through life having the success he did. He is an inspiration to all people who have gone through a near death experience. This man was probably the most respected athlete of his time."
2,Clay that dyes your hands...,This modeling clay is wonderful if you want to dye your hands whatever color you are using. I was very disappointed in the quality of it in that regard. You literally had to wash your hands inbetween colors because the dye would go from your hands to the next color. I wouldn't purchase it.
2,original cover,This is the same cover that came with the board - really not good quality but I have not been able to find another that fits this board. It is flimsy and poorly constructed and does not stay on the board securely. It is just about enough to make me buy a different board when this cover disintegrates - won't be long.
1,"Polder 5217-82 Deluxe Ironing Station Replacement Pad and Cover, Natural","What was sent to me was not what I ordered. The photo lead me to believe it would fit my 1751 c-82 ironing board, but did not. The one I got was very skinny at the front tip part. The one I needed is a bit wider. That should be expressed by Amazon. First time I'm let down by Amazon."
1,BH,"Was not the right size although picture shows it to fit a wide board, it did not. It was too narrow to fit plus quality was poor."
2,Serious problems uploading recordings done with external mic,"The minidisc can be used for several things. Among those:1) listening to songs recorded in CDs. I have to say I am very happy with this fonctionality.2) Recording songs with an audio microphone (not included).Very interesting fonctionality for people who play music and want to record themselves in rehearsing or live concerts (in my case, playing the violin). This is what I bought it for. The quality of the recording is excellent, given the means and compared to previous non-professional portable analog formats. Serious problem: the software included does not permit to upload songs to the computer not downloaded before so you can not transfer it easily to other audio formats. I asked Sony customer service and basically after three tries of their complex web support system I got either no response or authomatically generated useless responses."
4,soft and warm pashmina - for summer use,"I love this pashmina. The color is a nice gold, but not too shiny. It is soft and warm enough to wear over a sleeveless dress on a cold summer night. It is not very thick though so for winter I only use it as a scarf or to keep me warm indoors.I would definitely buy it in other colors if need be."
4,www.PHASHARA.com,"Talib is probably the most humble and insanely talented of all emcees today. I happened to bump into him a couple of years ago at AUDIOTISTIC in San Burnadino, CA., we were both at a gas station near the venue asking for directions to our hotels. Real cool cat. If Eminem were to battle Talib it's over for Em. Yeah, I said it.Talib Enbodies hip-hop. For more of that type of hip-hop peep www.PHASHARA.com and enjoy some of our lesser known gems in hip-hop."
4,Best since black starr,"Mos Def has already proved himself as one of the top MC's in the game and now Talib Kweli has stepped up and put out his best stuff since black starr. This is no pop album this is true hip hop at it's best. The whole album is good top to bottom with maybe the exception of talk to you and gun music, but even those don't interrupt the whole flow of the album. If you are sick of these bubble gum rappers with there pop hooks(NELLY, JA RULE, ETC.)then you'll be feeling this album. Look for the songs stand to the side and get by."
5,"True 'QUALITY""","I was familar w/ Talib Kweli (from Black Star and Hi-Tek collobrations) but this is the 1st and hopefully not the last Talib Kweli Cd I will purchase. This is one of the best CD's of 2002, hands down. From sketch comedy from Dave Chappelle & Michael Rappaport to moving ""Get By"" and ""Proud"" (which I had the opportunity to hear him perform live @ Prospect PArk, BKLYN last summer) to sweet ""Talk to you"" (w/ Bilal singing sweetly) to the fun ""Waiting for the DJ"" and other hits. I loved this CD from beginning to the end.If quality is what you want say his name. . .KWELI!"
5,Album of the Year,"Title says it all. This is the best album I've heard since Reflection eternal Train of thought. Every song in this album is good, when i was listening i didn't skip one song. Kweli's got a bright future."
5,Quality is Quality Material,"Wow, Talib has done it again, from initial days as Blackstars till now he had rock the mic with ill lyrics. From is first song of the album ""Rush"" to ""Won't You Stay"" is a complete novel of intellectual hip hop. He makes a vivid portrait of how he feels, he makes you believe in joy when he raps about his newborn in the track ""Joy"" and he makes you think deeply in the track entitled ""The Proud"". Featurinng Black Thought, Mos, and many more, this album is a definite HIT!!!! I LOVE IT. If you are really into real conscious hip hop, this is the album for you. A instant classic, side by side with ""Phrenology"""
2,Talib.. An artist?,I understand that Talib is a artist that is in the pro-black issue but that doesn't mean you have to put out a bad album. I like 1 or 2 songs but then there are some songs with good beats but then dumb lyrics and then good lyrical songs with bad beats it just doesn't work like that. Hope my review will help you in selecting your music.
2,kinda just there,while I think Talib Kweli is a Very talented Rapper&Wordsmith in the Vein of Nas among others as a Solo Artist it just doesn't work fully.He seems like He is going through the motions of the Producers here as too getting in&making the material his own.He has a few moments but He just isn't much of a Solo Artist too me.
1,what a disgrace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,What a disgrace this is the biggest dissapointment in Hip-Hop history I thoght this cd was gonna be as tight as reflection eternal but this cd is lamest piece of work ever created the reason being that Hi-Tek didn't produce this there is only one orite track called guerilla moonson rap and that track itself isn't that tight. the only reason I gave it one star is because it takes alot of balls to release such garbage. i am so dissapointed that i'd rather listen to elvis!!!!
3,"Quality Lyrics, but what happened to the beats and hooks?","Im a dedicated fan of Talib Kweli. He is a talented MC that speaks from the soul. When I heard ""Get By"" on the radio I was impressed with everything that came from that song. He was spittin a lyrical masterpiece and he had the beat and the hook to back it up. So I thought I'd give the album a try. When I started listening to it I was lovin it, cuz it opened up great with the song ""Rush"" and then went right into ""Get By,"" so im thinkin, this CD is tight, but then I kept listening and I was a little dissapointed. Talib Kweli has these serious lyrics that are off tha chain, but his beats and hooks/chorus' didn't really impress me. Its a good album just not great. I expeced more from Talib Kweli"
5,are you kidding me?,"Talib Kweli proved himself apt and able years ago. With this album he has proved that he is the BEST. I don't use this term lightly. His lyrics are unbested in the game. With producers such as Kanye West, Kweli manages to take the best beats and combine masterful flows and lyrics to do it all exceptionally well. May fortune smile upon Kweli on his next album. Support Talib Kweli, support GOOD MUSIC (buy this before you THINK about buying Eminem or Spears)."
3,We need Hitek Back!,"IM A Huge Kweli fan and after the blackstar album and reflection eternal this doesnt match up at all, at first i was very dissapointed although his lyrics are always on pointand are very smart. I cant say i hate the cd cause there are some good tracks on it but doesnt come close to what reflection eternal did for me. i just hope his 3rd effort will bring back hitek, or another blackstar albumwould be great,Mos def is quite a talent but i always thought kweli was the more talented mc and i really expected more. 3 and half stars"
3,Occasionally elated,Production diversity and passionately positive lyrics keep Quality from succumbing to dumbed-down beats and dated genre crossovers.
2,Did not meet expectations,"After seeing that this album was highly recommended by most of the Amazon reviewers and because it was featured on numerous true hip-hop themed ""listmania's,"" I chose to buy this CD. Sadly, I really feel let down, especially after hearing the single ""just to get by"" which is one of the redeeming qualities of this album. To be honest, Quality is chock full of lackluster beats and average lyrical content. So if you're planning on buying this album like I was, beware."
5,I'm going out on a limb here.,"I just have to say that this album might have to be an instant classic. Buy the album don't download it. Sit in your roomm, throw on the earmuff headphones and just chill."
5,different dimension,"i don't mind what other people said, to me this is straight classic, reflection eternal is on different dimension, anyway get them both, believe me it worth ur money and your time."
3,Reflection Eternal was much better,Reflection Eternal was much better than this album. Lyrically the album is dope. The beats are just not ill enough for me. I was definitely expecting more from this album.
3,"3.5 really, very disappointing","While there are several good tracks on this CD, I was pretty disappointed with it overall. Kweli's lyrics aren't nearly as sharp as on Reflection Eternal, which if you don't own, you should go and buy or download this instant--Reflection Eternal is amazingly good hip-hop, and is one of the best albums I've ever heard. Black Thought and Phaorahe Monch are good with Kweli on Guerrilla Monsoon despite the lack of any melody. Mos Def unfortunately doesn't drop one verse when he guests; but Kweli has his moments, particularly on Gun Music, where he manages to work in an allusion to Goodfellas and his flow is out of control on some tracks. Considering his work on RE, though, Kweli could've done much more. The absence of Hi-Tek is also noticeable--none of the music is as catchy or complex as in RE. Also, check out Blackstar, where Kweli is much stronger."
5,o my god,"this cd is one of the greatest hip hop cds ever. talib drops some of the illest rhymes you will ever hear. he is right up ther with rakim in lyrical greatness. this cd is nonstop good listening. all of the beats are tight, especially the ones from kanye west. i seriously reccomend that if you dont have this cd get, even if you don't like hip hop. this is a classic"
4,Feels good to hear ..Real Hip Hop...Thanks Talib,"True Hip Hop has almost died several times. Thank god MC's such as Talib Kweli breath air into the lungs of this music genre whenever it gets ""short-winded"". ""Quality"" is a very strong album that has tight beats and rhymes just like rap music suppose to be. Nobody is getting murdered on every track and the vibe just feels good.t-hanes"
2,what happened to the TRUE KWELI-TY,first this is definetly not a classic.. it's a disgrace for what Talib Kweli stands for. His wordplay is killed by the wack mainstream beats.. it seems the industry has gotten to the underground and is starting to kill all the dope emcees. I pray talib finds the correct path again and does another collabo with mos cuz BlackStar is incredible.. and Reflection Eternal.. i never thought they could split like that.. but for hip hops sake they better get back together.. i gave Kweli 2 stars cuz he was my favorite emcee till i heard this.. now i think ill stick to Mr. Lif and Binary Star.
2,Not a studio MC,"Talib Kweli strikes as the type of cat who, if I was at a party and he was freestyling in the corner, I'd be impressed; if someone put on a beat and put a mic in his hand, he'd get off; or if he was rhyming on the corner with someone else beatboxing, he'd sound nice. The problem is, on two different albums, that ability hasn't translated well.The beats on this album are adequate at best; the song featuring DJ quick (number 10) is the best track. Kweli's lyrical ability, while impressive for what it is, just doesn't sound good when placed over top of overproduced tracks.kweli is an old-schooler; he needs a minimalist touch, a la the Fugees, Tribe Called Quest style. He's a b-boyer from back in the day, And when he tries to spout lyrics that have substance behind them, he just sounds awkward.Ironically, though, i like listening to the album, but I recognize that it's not a classic."
2,not true quality,"Talib kweli is great refection eternal was one of the best hip hop albums ive heard but quality is lacking in tight rhymes, the beats are bad and you just plan can't bump to this cd. check out his first production."
2,WRONG PRODUCERS,"BLACK STAR WAS DOPE, TRAIN OF THOUGHT WAS DOPE-WHY? KWELI'S DOPE RAP, HI-TEKS DOPE BEATS. MOST OF THIS ALBUM IS LIKE NOISE TO MY EARS INSTEAD OF MUSIC, ALOT OF THE BEATS ARE NOT ARRANGED RIGHT MUSICALLY. 'WAITIN 4 THE DJ' AND 'PUT IT IN THE AIR'(PRODUCED BY DJ QUIK) IS WHAT I CALL MUSIC, 2 TIGHT STAND-OUT TRACKS. JUST LISTEN TO EVERY OTHER SONG, STOP 4 A SECOND, THEN CHUCK ON 'PUT IT IN THE AIR' AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT IM SAYIN. IT'S LIKE A RELIEF FROM A HEADACHE. KWELI, U SQUASH MOST LYRICISTS OUT THERE, GET QUIK, HI-TEK, PETE ROCK IN THE STUDIO AND MAKE A CLASSIC. IM A RAPPER/PRODUCER LIVING IN SYDNEY, I GOT PEOPLE THAT KNOW U, IF I BUMP INTO U, I'LL GIVE U SOME MORE ADVICE. PEACE AND ONE LOVE."
3,exchanges kwelity for quality,"Fans of Blackstar and reflection eternal might be disapointed with kweli's solo LP, it sounds like with the help of producers other than Hi-Tek, kweli is trading in his soulfull thought-provoking, insightful, conscious vibe for something a bit more accessible and easier on the masses. It's a cd that can get your ride crunk, and do it with style - and some of the lyrics are quite good... but I miss the hi-tek chemistry, and the conscious younger talib."
3,Talib Kweli???,"This isnt Talib Kweli...listen to Reflection Eternal and youll know what I mean. Its switched his production to mainstream garbage on this work of trash and his verses are much shorter. I gotta give his lame as* a 3 for pity because his lyrics are still good but he went commercial on us. On Black Star and Reflection Eternal, he was flawless...If he can redeem himself on a third album then long live his career or otherwise i wanna break his cds."
2,I was dissapointed,"First off, let me start by sayin that I feel Kweli as an artist and all that he stands for, but jus because ur a conscious rapper doesn't mean imma immediately feel ur stuff. Kweli needs Hi-Tek or Mos Def. He has too many collabs on this LP. He shouldn't even consider himself a solo artist. He should have also kept the producers to a minimum. Kanye West is no Hi-Tek. Why did he pick those soft J-Dilla beats that he chose? What was ''gun music''? Yo Talib, I love your music, but next time around you gotta do better than this."
2,Bad...just bad.,"Disappointing. It's a given that Bruce Lee made a huge mark as the pioneering Chinese actor in Hollywood, on how martial arts movies are made today, and how how martial arts and mixed martial arts are practiced today. That said, to me, this one just failed to provide an interesting perspective from that meaningful angle. I mean, LL Cool J and Eddie Griffin providing commentary? Really?? (I actually like both of these guys otherwise). I would have enjoyed more insightful perspective on the subject from those who are relevant to the history, his life, and those within the martial arts community. Unfortunately, I found this to be a snoozer. Just my two cents..."
5,How Bruce Lee Changed the World,This is one of the best videos I've seen on Bruce Lee. I have seen it before on cable but the extra's included on the DVD make it even better than the TV version.
5,How Bruce Lee Change The World,This DVD is a most buy for anyone who is a fan of Bruce or just hearing about him for the first time.
2,Bruce Lee's Impact,"The dvd ""How Bruce Lee Changed the World"" documents various modern day artists who were inspired by the late Bruce Lee. It is interesting to see the vast specrum of people from music, sports, art, and martial arts who were touched by Bruce Lee's example.If you are a Bruce Lee fan you will enjoy this dvd."
5,Cheap Price Great Quality,"Build quality is excellent. Slower focus but you can speed up focus by using the limit switch.Pretty sharp wide open and especially sharp @ f8. Definately worth the money especially when youconsider that the WR lens is almost $400 higher.Ordered this lens and had it shipped over night, arrived the next day. Packaging was more thanadequate. Thanks Amazon for the stellar job you do.I highly recommend this lens. It's the best $400 lens I've purchased."
5,Burke is the Best!,"What a great book ... Vachss has done a masterful job of spinning an intricate web of betrayal, lies and pain. Burke is back hunting on the mean streets of Portland ... and he's determined to find the missing Rosebud, a young girl running from an unknown pain. The trail leads Burke to some very different and unique outlaws. Every one could spell Burke's doom. And it's not just the enemies, perhaps it will be Gem, the woman who says she's Burke's wife, who will bring him down? But you're going to have to read the book to unravel this web. A fantastic read for everyone!"
3,Ouch,"More lecture than normal, dulls the most recent entry to the Burke series. Too many interrupted sentences annoy more than enlighten. We always learn something new, this time about VA hospitals, but Burke obviously needs his ""family"" to fully recover from the pain of an assasination attempt."
1,Come back to NYC Burke!,"I have read all the Burke novels and this one by far is the worst. Yes he has gone outside NYC before but this was just plain BAD. What makes this series so good are the cast of characters that complement the main character. Like Max the silent, the mole, the prof, etc etc etc. Without them it's just not the same. Yes I understand that Burke needed to leave NYC, does not mean I have to like it! I just hope that the next installment finds Burke back in NYC."
4,Pretty good.,"It's durable, smooth and eye-catching with long-lasting shine. The compartment secures liquids and powders with no leakage. Downside? The clasp breaks easily."
4,Party At the palace,This is a great DVD I purchased as a gift to my brother.Howvwre the Product has not been delivered to him yet?Can you please let me have some shipping details with Air way bills etc. so I can trace this item
4,Joe Cocker Rocks!,Not the greatest concert DVD at all - but individual performances are terrific. Joe Cocker just rocked the house. Brian Wilson - while rather catatonic - brought back terrific memories. Dame Edna and Lenny Henry made me laugh. Annie Lenox was awesome. The Queen set sounded terrific - and the Motown drivel should have been excluded. I still would recommend this highly - as it is a part (and party) of history - and you can't help but be caught up in it all.
1,McCartney fans get the short end.,"For Paul McCartney fans, this DVD is a huge let down. They only included 3 of his songs, All you need is love, Hey Jude and While my guitar gently weeps. Songs that were cut were ""Her Majesty"" (at only 1 min long, would it have killed them to include this gem), Blackbird, and Sgt. Pepper/The End. As I Beatles fan, I purchased this DVD expecting to see ALL of Paul's songs. Thank God for Ebay, anyone want a used copy, cheap ??"
5,irreverent short stories weave together into beautiful whole,"Louis is angry and irreverent, but yet not offensive. It'a a very quick, enjoyable read. The short stories in this work touch on every issue you can imagine, mixing humans and anthropomorphic creatures against a graphic backdrop of contemporary reservation life. If you like Sherman ALexie, you'll love Louis!"
2,Great Quality!!!! **Update** not really,I was surprised with the quality of this key chain! Its feel durable and the logo looks top notch!!! Comes in jewelry style box and the product is very polished!! If you are looking for a great valet key chain look no further!!!Update:After three months of use the valet part has broken off.
5,Educational book made fun!,"What a fantastic book! Kids follow a story of a beach party where they learn how to count based on the number of feet on different animals! They can practice basic addition and counting by different sets (2's, 4's, 10's). The illustrations are so kid friendly and fun and the story you follow is sure to put a smile on your face, especially all that the crabs do!I read this book to a class of Kindergarteners who recently had learned to count by 10's and were learning how to count by 2's. They had such a great time using their newly acquired skills and every page we had to stop on and count all the different feet as many ways as they knew how. It is a great educational book made fun for kids of all ages."
2,Why so expensive?,A friend recommended this CD but I haven't actually purchased this yet - because I cant find it anywhere for less than $90. Why so expensive? Clearly from the reviews it looks like its been MUCH cheaper in the past. Whats the story with this CD?!!
3,Wrong composer(s)?,"I listened to this CD intending to buy it, but then noticed that the composer for each piece is listed as Johann Sebastian Bach. If that error is continued in the CD itself, it is a gross one. Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven, Tschaikovsky, etc., are represented in the CD. I certainly wouldn't buy it in order to mis-educate my grandson as to who wrote what.If the error is just in the online contents listing, someone should correct it immediately!"
4,Magician dvd,"Always interesting; however, too much intro before each segment; seems a waste of time and dvd space."
2,Be prepared to skate,"After owning many different styles of these Minnetonka moccasins that are great have to warn that these soles slip or slide in wet conditions or on dusty floors, so beware...or clean meticulously."
5,Never gets old,"After the great success of ""Composure,"" the ""Telescopes"" EP is possibly one of those gems of music which is often overlooked. When I first got this cd back in 2006, I initially got it because of hearing tracks such as ""julian"" and ""Flowers..."" online. That same year I took that cd on a road-trip across country, and though it wasn't the only cd I listened to it did get a lot of play time. Two years later, the melodies of waking ashland (RIP) are still getting stuck in my head. This cd is nothing but a catchy and brilliant piece of artistry which most likely, if you appreciated ""Composure,"" will never get old.Be sure to check out ""We shot the moon"" - Jonathan's new band with two guys from the band Sherwood. They sound awesome and very much like Waking Ashland did on ""Telescopes"" and its predecessor ""Composure"""
4,Great stuff,Heard it on KEXP Seattle. Bought it. Like it a lot. They have kind of a rock folk thing going but with more power behind. Buy it. I think there is a new album on the way too.
1,Activision is writing the good reviews!,Don't be fooled by the long detailed and positive reviews. Donna Johnston from NY is listed in the credits of all the Cabela titles as the QA Lead. Why is she giving her review on the games she worked on which you see on every Cabela game? It looks like Activision is paying their employees to write reviews for them. This game has poor graphics and is tedious and boring. There are much better hunting games out there. Don't waste your money on their falsely advertized garbage.
5,"Great Value, and I'm not even a hunter!","That's right - I've never hunted, and never really plan to - but I really did like this game, and it surprised the heck out of me!Deer Hunt plays like a cross between Halo and Thief, and requires both strategy (your equipment, your scents and calls, clothing, the right gun, managing resources, etc) and quick fingers for those all-action moments. You'll spend most of your hunt tracking the deer you want through huge, amazingly detailed environments, setting up your equipment, and luring that perfect buck into your sights.The controls are easy to learn, and there's even an alternate control set for us lefty's who like to game! I'd probably only have given it 4 stars, but the lefty-friendly thought pushes it up that final notch.Great game for the money, no doubt about that."
5,Fit the Wife's Truck,Worked fine in the Wife's 2002 Bravada. Factory 7-Blade GM Towing Connector. Took longer to hook the trailer to the ball than to plug in my trailer lights.
5,Worked Perfectly,This was a great way to adapt for the 7 pin connector for a 4-pin straight on a Chevy Suburban. It was an excellent purchase and you won't find it cheaper anywhere else.
4,Works fine,"It seems well enough made and it worked fine for my small trailer connected to me Touareg. Plastic housing doesn't seem really sturdy, but it shouldn't be under any significant stress so that is fine."
2,Instrumental only!,"I expected the ""best"" of Mikis Theodorakis to include lyrics, but regrettably this album contains only instrumentals. Surely any celebration of Theodorakis's music should include his vast repertoire of Greek poetry set to music and sung by human voices?"
5,Great film,This is a very good film with the lovely Mark Harmon playing the police chief. Very different from his NCIS role.
1,Harmon Having No Personality Is Not Kool or Acting,"When I saw that a Prey book was going to be made into a movie I was excited. Then I say Mark Harmon was the lead. Wooden, vapid and an actor who thought he could phone it in, I was on the side of the bad guy.For the love of strawberry ice cream replace Harman or make him the Protagonists"
3,It's okay,"Another movie for an afternoon's intertainment. Sort of predictable, but Mark Harmon is easy on the eyes. I will watch it again."
2,No Power,"I have had this system for a few years now, and it has about 2 Watts of total power. Do not get this stero if you are looking for a high-wattage stero system. It has no bass at all!! But If you are looking for a little wimpy system to listen to country music, then this would be a great product for you."
4,Good product,"Good product. It IS lightweight, so depending on the lighting it can be see-thru. So far I've been able to get around this, though. Super fast shipping."
5,Good Deal,"I bought a black sarong. The fabric is lightweight, but otherwise very nice. The size matches other sarongs I own. When washed the color only runs a bit. You can't beat the price."
2,Smoke smell,"I ordered two of these for an upcoming beach trip. The reeked of cigarette smoke. I contacted the seller and was told that ""We've heard this before..."" (yet you haven't done anything about it??) and ""The dyes on these solid sarongs can take on a smell similar to cigarette smoke."" Fabric dye that smells like cigarettes? I doubt it. They did refund the cost of one sarong. Fine, but I still bought a product I assumed was new but sure didn't arrive that way.I'm also disappointed in the size. I am a large and although this fits my waist, I won't be able to wear it as a dress tied at the neck like I wanted.That said, the fabric is soft and the colors are pretty so I'm sure they'll get used for something. Probably my kids will use them this summer."
2,sarong,Too small to wear as a skirt I am a size medium and this sarong does not fit all the way around Should only be ordered if you are a size 6 or lower with very small hips
5,Great book,This is a great book where Frazier explores many of the issues that multiraical people deal with. She uses personal interviews with multiracial people as well as drawing on her own personal experience. Although I am not multiracial (I am black) I found it very insightful and it will help me to relate to multiracial people better. A must read for anyone who is multiracial or who cares about befriending them.
4,Very insightful,"Tucker Frazier breaks new ground in this thoughtfully written and thoroughly original work. Through her broad interviews and examples from her own life, she gives voice to the under represented of the under represented. And her reflections on the spiritual lives of multiracial people are profound. Readable, enjoyable, provocative."
5,Very Helpful Book,"I bought this book since we may become adoptive parents of a biracial child. I felt it was important to understand the experiences of a biracial person in our society. I found Ms. Frazier's book to be very helpful. She is very open in the book about her real life experiences and I was really touched by her recollections. I feel that this book would be helpful to many people, in terms of opening eyes to what a biracial child/adult feels and experiences as they grow up."
2,Check All That Apply,"The religious stories and references to religion woven throughout the book got in the way of Sundee telling about her personal journey to find herself and acceptance from others. After reading the book, I was not convinced she felt successful."
1,Mediocre at best..,"I'll start by saying I LOVE The Kinleys! The have some of the best harmony I've ever heard (with the possible exception of The Corrs.) For those of you that don't know who The Corrs are as they are not Country, you might want to check them out. They are OUTSTANDING!However, I'm very glad that I borrowed this ""All in the Family"" CD from a friend before I bought it. After waiting for 4 years, I'm somewhat disappointed. ""II"" was such a great CD, I think their best CD they've come out with. It was solid from start to finish. ""All in the Family"" doesn't come close! I sure hope they head back into the studio to start working on another one...fast!"
2,"Weak, and sad to see it so...","Hard to believe this is the same duo who sang ""If Ever I Needed You"" and ""You're Still Here"". The songs are mediocre, but more disturbing is the lack of emotional conviction in the singing. Only the harmony vocal on ""I Will"" (which Blackhawk did much better) has any feeling. They're both happily married now--(odd how many songs are about divorce and breakups)and maybe their motivation is gone. But it's a pity that this self-released album sounds more like a big label pop album than their first two excellent country-flavored albums. What a sad disappointment!"
5,The Kinleys All in the Family,This is a Must Have for any fan of The Kinleys. There are several tracks that are absolutely incredible! The final track will tug at any new mom's heart!
3,Solid Comeback,"The Kinley's have had a tough time with country radio, after bursting into the scene with their first single ""Please"" it seemed like the delightful twins were a sure fire hit. But after the lack of radio support their second album II failed to get the attention it deserved.Now with All In The Family, Jeniffer and Heather have crafted a solid return.Stand out tracks: How Can It Be That You Don't Love Me Anymore and The Price Of Love.For anyone new to the Kinleys I suggest you check out Just Between You and Me. For Kinley's fans, check this one out with minor reservations."
5,Fantastic!,"I have a recording of the 3rd Shostakovich by an American group. This is like a different piece! It's a full, rich, expressive rendition of one of the greatest quartets Shostakovich wrote. I recommend it highly. I just wish the program notes were more complete--it doesn't even give the names of the players, but only states that the members of the Tanjev Quartet were ""usually the first chair players in the Leningrad Philharmonic."" But the music is what counts and it's great."
3,"Unoriginal and weird, but the illustrations are superb!","The best part of this book would be the ilustrations by Judith Mitchell, one of the greatest illustrators in a series known for having above-average illustrators to begin with! The idea of time/space travel through an old relative's attic is very unoriginal, having being done numerous times before in interactive fiction by: R.L Stine (in ""The Golden Sword of Dragonwalk""), Ellen Kushner (""Knights of The Round Table""--actually time-travel through an old book in this one), among other examples.In one very odd story line, you, the reader, wind up meeting your own mother at the same age you are at, at her birthday party. (???) She actually believes you when you say you're her kid, which seems implausible.Without Mitchell's illustrations and the really cool cover design, I'd give this book 2 stars, but due to those visual factors, it earns a 3."
5,The Encyclopedia of Angels,Very useful when reading other works on Angels of Light and on Fallen Angels. I have found everything I have needed so far. Thank you.Yolanda Galo
3,good phone but poor sound quality,"I received this phone yesterday and just couldn't wait to use it based on past great experices with other Nokia phone.However.....After the first couple hours of exploring it.....I found this ""cool"" Nokia flip phone has poor sound quality while I was driving on the highway.....I tried to talk to friends both with and without headset.....they couldn't hear me that well....not as my old Sanyo 8100, which has perfect crystal clear sound even I was driving during the windy days....it doesn't have anything to do with the reception (as other Nokia phones, the reception is great), everyone I asked all responded that I should get a different phone....If you normally don't use the phone while you're driving....then this is a great phone to have but if you're a person like me who like to talk to friends even when you're on freeway.....please think twice....."
2,phone Died,I thought it was a pretty good nuts and bolts phone.room for improvement.1. speaker needs to be louder.2. the headset of all things shouldn't sound like a tin can.My phone died after 2 months. I found condensation on the inside. I work in and outside alot but the phone never got wet. I have to believe it was the condensation that killed it. The interior of the phone is not sealed.
4,Nearly idiot-proof,"Just got this phone for my wife. She is ""technically challenged"" so this phone is great for her. It has large numbers making it easy for her to call people. The on/off buttons are colored green/red so she can easily figure out how to turn it on/off. The display is clear and bright with simple icons making it easy for her to select the phonebook and pick out the names of people to call. With her previous phone, she could never figure that part out, and typed every number each time she called someone. I only give this phone 4 stars however since the builtin camera and FM radio present major challenges for her and I have serious doubts that she will ever figure out how to use them. Nokia should make a phone that a complete idiot can use, then I would not need to do tech support. Thank god for the Apple iMac and iSync as well, since this allows her to update and sync the phonebook."
2,disappointed,"I've had several of Nokia's phones before and have never been disappointed with them until now. When using the hands-free headset, whoever I was talking to sounded liked they were talking into a tin can. Since I use the hands-free set the majority of the time I'm on the phone, this was a big problem. The other problem I found was that the phone did not have a very powerful vibrate mode. I sometimes did not even hear it when it was sitting on my desk next to me. The one plus of the phone (other than Nokia's easy-to-use menus) is that's it's very light and compact. Because of the problem with the hands-free set, I had to exchange it for a Motorola V360. This phone is a bit heavier, but has much better sound quality and vibrate mode."
2,Very cheaply made.,"I've had this phone less than a month and the finish is already chipping off. You have to position it perfectly on your ear in order to hear properly. Other than that's, it's been ok. It just seems very cheaply made."
3,It's ok...,"This phone is packed with features from the camera to the radio, but when it comes to storage it's not that reliable. I find myself frequently deleting unneeded games, wallpapers, and ring-tones to make room for more. Also, I got it in October and last month the screen froze similar to a computer and now it's simply un-useable. So, let me lay it out flat. It's a gorgeous phone and easy to love but, if I were you I'd look a little more before settling."
2,"Loved it at first, but not anymore!","I upgraded my phone two months ago from a Motorola V300 to this model because I wanted a radio and a larger keypad. After one month, the radio no longer worked, the battery dies when it claims to be fully charged, it takes three tries to get it to connect when making a call, and sometimes the phone just freaks out and resets itself while you're in the middle of texting or surfing the web. It's flimsy. I've had my V300 for two years and everything still works on it. The Nokia 6101 has a lot of issues."
4,Brilliant little phone,"This is a great phone. The basic features are easy to use, the buttons are a useful size.The phone is very small and light, and the battery performs well.This one came with a recharge dongle that allowed me to reuse my old Nokia recharger on this phone as a spare.The extra features are brilliant. Camera works easily and takes little movies. I really like the radio too.For the money I think this is the best phone around at the moment (2006)."
4,Great reception!,"I bought this phone in hopes of overcoming a weak T-Mobile signal. I couldn't use my old cell phone at all at my office and a few other places I frequent. The Nokia 6101 was definitely a good purchase to meet my needs. I can now sit at my desk at work and have a conversation without any problem! It also has many of the ""extras"" that people have come to expect today - camera, radio, voice dialing, loudspeaker, etc. My only complaints: the loudspeaker feature can be activated only after you have placed a call and the radio works only if you plug in a headset that acts as an antenna."
2,NO GOOD,"Don't buy this phone! Yeah it's free on tmobile.com but the phone is raggedy. This is Nokia's worse phone they ever made! The phone be cutting off by itself for no reason. The memory is low and the ringtones are loud and sometimes unclear. The camera doesn't show up clearly and then the battery goes down quick if you have it on vibrate. Also, you have to put the phone earpiece on your ear in the right place or you can't hear the other person. I never used the ugly headset. Just don't buy this [...]"
1,Sucks,"This phone sucks. Your likelihood of brain cancer will be greatly increased with this phone because the ear plug comes unplugged all the time and in the end, you don't even bother to use the ear plug. Terrible design! Don't know how they could make such a bad design!"
1,THIS PHONE SUX!!!!!!,"THis phone will torture you to the death! THe keys rust really easily, it is amazingly SUCKY! and is $150?!?!?!?!?!?!?!WHO THE HECK WOULD BUY THIS??????Call quality SUX!"
4,Nokiaits,"This phone suffers from the same defect as any other Nokia mid to high end phone; Raging mediocrity.It does the normal phone functions decently.It the screen is ok.The rings are loud, but the call audio is lower than some other phones.Reception isn't really a problem but i don't recall any other phones from Nokia that had _bad_ reception.The screen is slightly better than similar priced Motorola's, but not as good as the Samsungs.Some high points:Large buttons.Large Screen.Newer menu, but still easy to use.Lows:Domestic tri-band (850/1900 US, and 1800)New, very thin power port that is not the same as most of the Nokia's"
3,"Not Great, Simply Put","I got this phone knowing some of the bad reviews. Being my first cell phone. I didn't think I'd mind so much. At first it was great, perfect for me.However, 4mb of memory is so little... all the features get more annoying.It serves my needs still until I can upgrade. Now starts to freeze...I do like the size, and menus (they aren't THAT bad to navigate) and displays are nice to customize. It isn't a terrible phone, but not great.ALL PHONES have their quirks people range so much in reviews... and any phone can die even the best always a few rotten apples in the bunch. This phone was good for me as a first cell phone when I didn't need all the features and memory I would like now...So I won't knock more stars off because I outgrew it, but it does have it's issues and annoyances. Definitely not a phone for more advanced users or people who like features, and as for FM radio cool idea I used to use it... but since getting an MP3 player really haven't touched that feature."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I found this cd player to be a piece of junk. Within four months, the headphones had broken and the player itself was malfunctioning. Overall, I no longer trust Philips and will never buy from this brand again."
2,Broke!,"After using it for 3 days, the battery exploded! I had done nothing but left it there, no cords were attached, the batteries were brand new. After discovering about that, I tried to play it, all I got was a hold message and it wasn't on hold. The book said it was electrostatic discharge but I followed the directions and it still said hold. I have returned this for a refund, hopefully this will not be the problem others are experiencing. When I it worked though, it worked fine."
3,*Worked okay for 8 months ONLY,"I bought this player in Jan'01. My only complaints upon receiving it was, the sound and the in-ear BUD headphones. The sound is never loud even when it's turned to the maximum level, no matter what headphones you use. The headphones hurt my ears and died in June. Then, recently (August '01) I discovered that because the headphone jack moves, the sound goes in and out. BAD. For example--I have the CD player in my backpack, playing a CD and if the headphone plug moves, which it does, it interrupts the sound. At first I thought it was my headphones, but no its the machine. All in all I'm disappointed. Great look, handy handle loop, bad earphones, LOW SOUND, and wobbly headphone jack that kills sound. My advice, check out other machines first that is unless you like a machine that only works for 8 months."
1,not worth the money,"This may be a snazzy cd player, but if your looking for good to great sound quality, don't waste your money. Also, the headphones provided were discomforting to my ears. The jogging case is too small, and when carrying the cd player in it, it is pretty heavy."
3,"Great Sound, Not So Great ""Sports CD""","The sound quality is excellent. However, it does skip a little while jogging. The belt and pouch provided is a bit clumsy."
3,It is okay.,I owned this CD player and it was the best i ever had except the headphones are really cheap.
3,At Amazon Price Good Value for money.,"Pros:As the title goes,Carrying pouch,Bass Extension,Sound stage,Power save feature,ruggedness,even at brisk walking does not skip with the ESP off.Cons:Controls not easily accessable while in carrying case.Being a sport's model the head phone comfort level is unsatisfactory.Conclusion: Baiscally at this price I persume one can tolerate a bit of inconvience as to the player but the headphones do need to be replaced or upgraded."
1,BEWARE... POOP QUALITY! Glorified coloring book.,"Aparently, all of the Marvel ""Essential"" books/TPBs are in black and white, on cheap newsprint, and bound poorly. They resemble coloring books more than comics. So if you just wan't a cheap way to read the these old comic stories (and don't care about durability and/or quality) go for it, but I would recomend going for something a little higher quality."
2,Don't buy this!,"Buy the equivalent ""Marvel Masterworks"" Uncanny X-Men volume 1. It's the same story, but in colour as it should be. The ""Essentials"" are all in black-and-white, on low-quality paper and badly bound - the cover on my copy came off within a day. The only thing the ""Essential"" edition has to recommend is it contains specials and annuals like ""Giant Sized X-Men #1"" (where the new team are recruited), whereas the Masterworks contain only the regular books. But get your act together Marvel, these should be collectible books, not throwaways. Print the books in colour!"
5,Essential X-Men review by:Kenny Benton AN AWESOME BOOK!!!!,I have never been interested in X-Men but after I read this thrilling X-Men novel I have been collecting the book.This book has a great storyline and the ending is fantastic.If your an X-Men fan this is a definate reader!
4,Good Price + Good Comics = Good Reading,"This is for people who are intrested in the origin of Phoenix and the ""new X-Men"", and at about $.55 an issue it's a good deal."
4,An obscure dose of electric blues,"This CD contains some good electric blues from an obscure British band from the late 60s / early 70s. My favourite track would be 'Junior's Wailing', the guitar tone is just chilling on this as it wails its plea 'love me baby, love me when I'm down'. This version is way better than the Status Quo version IMO. Other good tracks are 'When All Your Friends Are Gone' and 'Contemporary Chick Con Song' as well as the extended 'Riding On The L & N/Hold That Train'.The only disappointment with this CD is the over 'hot' mastering, it clips in places and the dynamic range is too compressed, why can't the engineers get this right?"
4,"Not an instant classic, but brilliant nonetheless","Ian Hunter's second solo album didn't hit me right away like his self-titled debut or 1979's ""You're Never Alone with a Schizophrenic."" Sure, I knew it contained one of his greatest creations, the wistful and bittersweet ballad ""Irene Wilde"". But after a repeated listens, it grew on me and I found this to be essential Hunter even if Mick Ronson is absent and sorely missed. It contains Hunter's stab as Bowie-esque blue eyed soul (which he pulls off fairly well) in ""All American Alien Boy,"" the hard rock of ""Restless Youth"", the soaring ""You Nearly Did Me In"", and the philosophical ""God (Take 1)"". The musical eclecticism delivered by Hunter and his band here are to be admired and appreciated. It takes some effort to be fully appreciated but the rewards are well worth it."
4,The first high point of an overlooked solo artist,"The critics may have preferred his first self-titled solo album, but this one has many more high points and fewer low ones. Sounding still like a mix of Mott the Hoople and David Bowie, Hunter's dry humor has never been better. The droll deadpan vocal and superb bass solo of the title track could easily be counted among Hunter's solo best. The same dry sense of humor shows through on Hunter's take on religion, ""God Part 1."" The rockers rock hard (Restless Youth), and the ballads compare to Lennon's best in melody and style (Letter to Brittania, Irene Wilde). Some may be turned off by the preachiness of some lyrics, but Hunter is one of the few who can write personal songs that appeal to many. A rather run of the mill guest vocal by Queen also appears here. A must for Mott fans and those who search for the good albums that have been missed."
5,under appreciated,"this was always one of my favorite albums, still is. some of the most poetic lyrics hunter has ever penned."
1,How much is that worth really?,"This is an outdated computer priced just below a brand new one. For what it costs to have this thing shipped to you, you could add that together and by a new BETTER computer. Why are all these used laptops priced so high?"
4,still rockin,"I rememember dancing to ""Sex"" at the clubs and listening to ""Rock the Box"" on the radio when we all would be going out partying in the car. This c.d. brings back good memories. Isn't that what buying some music is about? Associating song with good times past. Don't get me wrong, the music stands alone,plus you get bonus remixes not found on the original album. Not my favorite sylvester project but still quite good."
4,Vic get's it right in the end,I really enjoyed Deep Water. It is the first Highsmith novel I've read and it won't be the last. A dark and painfully precise look into the mind of a man torchered by by the despicable adulterous acts of his wife. It's only real fault is trying to accept the initial notion that anyone would tolerate as much as our hero did. In the end he finally get's it right and does what he should have done much earlier.
5,In a League of Her Own!,"I've read the Ripley books, her book on writing mystery and suspense novels, which I found excellent, and just recently read Deep Water and found it absolutely hynotic. Highsmith was a marvelous storyteller, understated and brilliant! Just ordered her bio A Beautiful Shadow by Andrew Wilson, looking forward to it.Chill Waters"
4,"I bought a dozen titles, they were all good, not great.","very good music. I bought a dozen titles, they were all good, none stood out as great or better than the rest."
2,Not a multiplayer game.,"I think they did a fine job implying that you could play this game with more than one person. It is only the case if you want to play the rediculous side games, the game itself can only be played solo. The websites description of the game does not specify this, and neither do any of their trailers. Pretty lame."
2,Have You Read The Game Editiorial?!,"Yes, this game appears to be quite excellent, but it is NOT a ""Season 8"" story. The creators have been telling us the entire time that it will be a lost episode from SEASON 5. Please only post information that you know to be true, otherwise you will lead someone to make the wrong decision."
5,I Love this game!!!,"I love this game!!! It is a must have for any Buffy fan, and even non-Buffy fans. I have a friend who liked the game, and he doesnt even watch the show. Anyway, this is a really good game with semi-dfficult parts, and is a really good game over-all. I love it!!!!!"
1,The game is not arrived!,Sto ancora aspettando il gioco nonostante l'arrivo fosse previsto per il 26 ottobre 2011.Questo mi ha creato non pochi problemi dato che doveva essere un regalo di compleanno!Nn si può sollecitare il venditore?Grazie
2,Forget this precurser,"Although the philosophical side of this book is okay, the practices are not. Lomer suggests you to get your palm and handwriting analyzed, gather peas, sit still (without blinking), and many other seemingly pointless tasks. I suggest that you begin with Initiation Into Hermetics without this."
5,dr dre,"jeez... I cant verbalize music like I can enjoy it so my words will be accordingly lame compared to this! anyway... creme de la creme album here. a pretty mellow vibe if you dont know this band.. think : mellow, harmonic, a touch psychedelic, very original and creative, slightly catchy too -- but all in all very very cool in the end. they also have this cool no-cal thing going - harmonies are country meets beach boys - great. anyway, if you are not all about pop but instead love quality, great and orginal music you will make this your top 100 of all time. I certainly did. an amazing album. get it."
2,cheaply made!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was so excited to own a lenox flatware since they are known for having good quality product, but this set of flatware is very discouraging. I bought this set a month a ago to be exact! but after using and wash it in the dishwasher, rusting spots shows all over the knives, forks and spoons. I have to return it so badly since I can't use a lot of them. I can't beleive that lenox will sell an awfully cheap made flatware!!!!!!!!!"
3,Just Clearly Wrong.,"Japanese Adverts? You see in the UK (small country at the top of 'Yurp' for that *special 93% of y'all), we have this guy called Chris Morris. Bit of a media-baiting leg-end. My theory is this is actually by him. Its also got some samples of his work, but I think this is because people will think that *surely no one could be that arrogant*, and thus makes himself into a clever fellow. Incidentally atrecordings.com have it cheaper.But buy it here! that way it gets listed, and more people get to see my pathetic name listed as a reviewer!The acclaim!"
4,The Logic of real arguments,"I've bought this book after reading Alec Fisher's ""Critical thinking"" which i liked very much. ""The Logic..."" is not an easy reading for me as it requires a lot of thinking about philosophical issues but very useful as it teaches how to tackle long and difficult arguments. I believe that is the main purpose of the book and if someone likes that sort of reading then this book is a good choice."
2,Not very readable,"I had this book assigned in a class and the teacher, with avid support from the class, decided three weeks in to cut it out of the syllabus for the rest of the semester. My classmates and I all found the book rather difficult to understand and the format not at all intuitive to the way we learn. Maybe if you already had a background in philosophy or argument analysis the book would be more useful, but the arguments that were published for analysis were really complicated and required quite a bit of background knowledge that we didn't have."
4,"Not quite ""assorted""","These bottles do not come in assorted colors. By ""assorted colors"" they mean that the company does not have any control over what colors are sent. We received a box of only solid opaque black bottles. As we required these bottles to be clear and colored for a children's craft program, we were disappointed. The bottles themselves are of decent quality.The company was reasonable and we reached a resolution, but we hope they will consider updating their description."
2,Laser Mouse Prob's,I have a wireless microsoft mouse 7000. It has a little problem with the laser on the black part of the mouse pad.
1,Mouse does not slide easily.,"Very good looking mouse pad, but not usable. There is too much friction between my Logitech mouse and this mouse pad. Covering the bottom of the mouse with tape helped, but did not solve the problem. As much as I wanted this to work, I have to return it."
1,Not quite what is advertised!!!,"Bought this to use with my new Canon EOS 500D/Rebel T1i and the Canon EF-S 55-250mm zoom. When I received the product my first surprise was that in the included spec document it stated: ""This teleconverter is not designed for digital use. We do not guarantee its performance when used on Digital SLR cameras.""One would think that this is a rather crucial piece of information to warn people about on the Amazon site, given the amount of DIGITAL SLRs and associated equipment being bought...The second surprise was that I could attach the converter to the camera OK, but neither the 250mm zoom nor the standard Canon 18-55mm zoom would fit on it.In short, this MAY be a good teleconverter, but the information provided (from both Amazon and Tamron) to properly inform the buyer on what it is compatible with is very poor and misleading..."
1,Buy bigger lenses,Image quality is deteriorated and in the case of long zoom lenses AF does not work.Pretty much useless attempt at saving cost of buying bigger lenses.
4,Good results,"I've used the 1.4 teleconverter several times now with the Tamron 200-500mm zoom lens, and so far it is working great. Sharp photos, sufficient light. I do use a tripod with it, but then I used a tripod or some kind of stabilizer with this lens even without the teleconverter. The only issue I see so far is that I have to use the manual focus more often than I did without it."
4,GREAT TC+Cheaper Lens UPGRADE!!,"With a combo of my Nikon D300s+Nikon 80-200mm 2.8 and this Tamron SP AF 1.4x, I was able to get great up-close soccer photos! I can only speak for my lens combo, make sure you get the ""SP"" version of this TC. At 2.8, it will drop you a step to f/4.0, which is great during the morning/daytime games. In the evenings, I found I had to bump up my ISO with the above combination but cant beat it unless you have $$$$ for a 300mm f/2.8 :)"
3,Not bad,"The reason why I bought this item is my tele-converterter (by Kenko) was out of order. Comparing the picture with the previous one, I could not find remarkable difference in the picture and the AF speed.But, it seems sometimes the EXIF showed wrong information. I am not sure the cause is this item or my SLR..."
2,Extremly good,Nice multiplier. however i was surprise by the compatibility. all lenses from canon do not match with it. only the lenses with a red spot can fit it; I don't think it was describe in the product specification and technical document from Tamron
1,The Lebanese American,"I have to admit I couldn't finish reading this book. In fact, I wasn't able to move beyond its sickening Introduction; a frantic piece of propaganda, gasping for some historical depth to the recent ""Arab"" addition to the American mosaic. What better better way to offer that longed for depth than by hijacking 19th century Lebanese history, and the history of the migration of Christian peoples of the Middle East to America, and attributing it to the Arabs. Only bankrupt cultures resort to such tactics. This book should have been titled ""the Lebanese American"", but then again, the Lebanese don't need a rabid Arab Nationalists to tell their story to them. We know who we are, thank you very much! And please, stop hitching rides on our backs simply because your culture has nothing to show for!"
1,Utter Rubbish,"I agree with the commentators below! This book is pure propaganda, trying to pass itself on as scholarship. I could think of a million other things I can do with $45, none of them include coming even close to bying a piece of garbbage like Kayyali's ""book""."
4,Intelligent Procedural,"An intelligent, well-plotted, Roman police procedural. Hewson's strength lies in his ability to write for readers who want to think, and to develop characters we want to know."
2,"I second the ""Villa of Boredom""","While the ""Villa of Boredom"" reviewer already said a lot of the same things, much better than I could. The book was slow, the characters were bland, and some were moderately unlikeable. The so called hero seemed to be in the background of most of the book. Personally I found the ""crazy"" pathologist the truely likeable actual hero of the book, although she also seemed to take a back seat at times. I listened to the audio format, and the narrator's grating female impression also made things worse."
3,Heinous Crime,"This was an interesting book with many Biblical references. There were times when I felt lost. The story was missing continuity. I did find it rather implausable at times. Some of the character development was sketchy and never did complete itself. I would however, recommend it."
3,Not sure what to make of this one,"This story was an odd one. It was contrived, but it was supposed to be. The plot jumped around a bit, but it turns out that was to be expected. There were some unexplained turns and plot holes, but (I assume) they were intentional.I liked the first three quarters or so of the book, but once the Doctor left the town to confront the Writer, I felt that things started to go downhill. The huge chip that continues to grow on Ace's shoulder has become quite annoying as well. That said, I liked the way the plot was set up, I just felt it finished weakly."
3,Good Basic Cantonese,I have gone over this book in it's entirety and I must say that it's put together very nicely but the most important missing are the tapes. It would be excellent if it came with tapes.
4,"Good book, but misses some points","The first 5 chapters are redundant. The book starts out with crash course in HTML and VBScript which is barely useful for most of us. Only one chapter (28 pages) given for ASP tutorial. However the ADO coverage is highly informative. The book is good, but if you're looking for an ASP tutorial, go somewhere else."
3,This book is VERY Microsoft...,"Written by Microsoft people, this book does not even mention a word about browsers other than Microsoft Internet Explorer."
5,"Excellent book, easy to understand, very usefull & current.","This is an excellent book, detailing most of the important web techniques in a very easy to understand way. The chapters are dedicated to topics that are necessary to develop database enabled dynamic and browser independent web sites. The topics are covered in as much as detail but not to bore anybody with too much technical depth. Highly recommended for beginers to expert for reference. The ADO recordset is the best part/chapter. Read/buy this book if you are serious about Web Database Development."
2,Out of date,"This is a grate book, except for the fact that most of the examples do not work (even from the provided cd), and some of the controls referred to are out of date and some, no longer supported. The first half of the book is ok to get you familiarized with ASP and web based data access."
3,"Okay Book, Some Examples did not work.",Very interesting book with lots of information. I had a very frustrating time with the examples that did not work. I ended up not really using the CD at all and just stuck to reading through the examples in the book.
3,Good for users with VB knowledge,"This book is good for reader with basic knowledge on VB. The most usefule part is the first two weeks' chapters. From which, you can build a good and simple database/interactive web applications. The last week's chapters required deeper VB knowledge and don't provide the same details as previous two weeks. Anyway, it's a good choice for Windows based developer (especially beginner) to develop web database application."
2,Some examples don't work but good coverage of ADO & ADC,This book had good coverage of ADO and to a certain extent ADC. For the first 5 chapters a lot of the examples didn't work which is frustrating because you expect examples on a CD to have at least been tried before being included. All of these could be made to work by changing the code around a bit. You would think as the book was part written by a Microsoft person that they would know what they were doing! All I can say is if you do buy this book don't think it's something your doing wrong when these examples don't work - Hopefully this will be corrected in future editions.
3,Would be better if the examples all worked,"Not a bad attempt to teach a quite complex subject over a relatively short time. It is infuriating however that some of the examples do not work i.e In chapter 5 the script was put in the wrong place on some of the examples causing an error to occur. I can understand printing mistakes, but surely the examples should have been fully tested beforehand."
3,"Ok reference, bad organizaton, non practical examples","I expected this book to show more real world examples, not just cool non-practical ways to make your code work on generic applications. Get ""Professional Active server pages"" as a better detailed reference book. I got so mad after spending money on this book that I wanted to just throw it out my 7th floor window."
4,Perfect...Except For One Flaw,"This controller is great.It frees you from those messy,tangle-prone wires.The controller is similar to the Japanese Xbox controller (Controller S) except that it is a little wider,and heavier.The Left/Right triggers are a little harder to press,though...I had one problem though.I play Xbox Live a lot,and you probably know that you use a communicator headset,which plugs into the controller.There is no expansion/memory card plug-in on the controller.It's on the wireless reciever,on your Xbox.This controller is perfect for offline play,but...You know.GamerTag:TurboCircuits"
3,Hmmm not as good as I thought!,"Ok the controllers wireless functions are superb you really cant tell you are not wired to the console. Something to note if your a hardcore gamer though after only 4 weekends of play the left thumbstick has started to make a weird noise when it is pushed to the right, the stick actually feels really flimsy compared to the left one I was wary about it from the getgo. Another problem is the digital pad stinks if you push up you usually get a diagonal up not very good in a gameplay situation at all."
1,Logitech is missing the boat,Run do not walk away from the Logitech counter. When the rubber pads wore off my game pad I was willing to pay for replacement parts. Their 800 number sales line was delighted to tell me to call their toll call help line and sit on hold for 20 minutes. According to Logitech these parts are not available for replacement regardless of wether or not you wish to pay for them. This is a terrible example of customer service. Logitech has enough brand recognition apparently that it does not need new customers. I personally will never buy another Logitech product. Companies who refuse to support their products will not get my business.
4,Mr. Torres is correct,"Indeed the controller is incredible for what it does...it allows people like my sister, Ignacious, and Brett to walk right in front of me while I'm playing and they won't trip. It reacts very quickly and seems wired, but after playing with Mr. Torres' three controllers, I have noticed a thumbstick issue. I too play car games (NFS UNDERGROUND!!! Wassup!! It's so money and it don't even know it!) and the wall crashing is a pain...Also, the pad for the thumbstick seems to have worn out quite a bit...YO LOGITECH...where can I get a replacement pad, kid? May wanna recall the joystick issue..."
2,Not For Serious Gamer Use,"I found this controller to be good for only about 20 minutes. After that, the buttons and analog sticks sticks start to have a reaction time that usually gets you killed or makes you lose a race. I did buy it refurbished though, I'm not sure that that would have made a difference. I will definetly never buy this controller again or anything else by Longitech."
3,"Great at first, doesn't last long","I was very happy with the controller for the first 3 months I had it, then the left thumb pad wore down and is falling off. Then the left joystick also began to stick, and would not return to the home position. When playing halo, I can't stand still, when I let go of the joystick, it makes me slowly drift left, often falling off cliffs to my death. I would not buy this model again."
2,wore out in less than a year,"As noted by another reviewer, the rubber joystick pads wore out and were unreplaceable. After improvising with rubber bands, the controller itself then became unusable, drifting and not moving where the right joystick was pointed.This product was great for about six months, but I cannot recommend it due to it's short life."
5,This Product is great,"I think that this is the best controller that i havae ever used. The controller is better than one with a wire. The only thing that has given me problems is the rumble pack.WHat happens every once in a while is that the controller starts rumbling for about a minute, but hat has only happened once or twice. Other than that this is the best product that I have ever bought from microsoft, other than the XBOX console."
5,Best Wireless controller money can buy,"I got this controller last xmas and I have to say it is perfect in every sense of the word. I have two large dogs so with no cord no worry they will trip and bring down my xbox. The battery life is pretty darn good. I play madden alot, probably 2 to 4 hours at a time some time longer and I have gone at least 75hrs with out having to change the batteries. Granted with 4 batteries it is a little heavier but I do not think it is that noticable. I have never had an problems with mine other than I ahd to buy a new one when My rottie ate the one I got for xmas. So it is not doggie proof. Overall I would rate this as the best wirless controller out there. I have two of them."
4,HEART ATTACK!,"This is not an easy album. It might even be the Future. Innovative. Almost had a heart attack laughing the first time I heard ""Music Box Innards""--I'm OK now. We have most of his discontinued-by-manufacturer records. Buy this to get the Classic Rock out of your head and move forward."
3,Hit and Miss,"Im a big fan of Bucket's music, but this album doesn't do much for me. I liked Monsters and Robots, his Cobra Strike albums, and Cuckoo Clocks, but kaleidoscalp is too scattered and noise ridden even for Bucket. With the exception of few tracks (Android of Notre Dame for one) the album consists of severely disjointed songs filled with cuts to 'robot' sounds that destroy any chance of my enjoying the music. Too much messing around, Bucket, and not enough actual music. You rock, but not on this album. If you want hard shredding and pyrotechnics get a Cobra Strike album or Cuckoo Clocks. They're much better."
3,This album made me feel insecure about my organs,"The title of this review is not a joke. After listening half way through this album, I literally felt insecure about my organs. I honestly don't know how that is possible, and it is pretty much impossible to explain what that feels like, but that is what it felt like. The music is definitely strange. If you are checking Buckethead out for the first time, this album is definitely not for you. If you are already a Buckethead fan, then I don't know what to tell you, since you already probably know about this album/.It is electronic, with only percussion and the possible bass with every song, and it is all metallic, sporadic, and somewhat mesmerizing. I really don't know if I should be disgusted or in awe of the final result of this album, so I gave it 3 stars."
4,Russell seems like a true gentleman,"Great behind the scenes look at Gilligan's Island. Plenty of trivia for the fans, too.I had no idea how G.I. essentially ruined his career. He was a steady-working actor in Hollywood until he got his ""big break"" with Gilligan. He became typecast, and then found it difficult to get roles after that. Plus they were only paid for a few re-runs of the show. After that, no more $. Hence when it went into syndication even though it was played continuously in the 70s and even today, he doesn't make money from it.I was pleasantly surprised to find how Russell is quite gracious when talking about his co-stars, especially Jim Backus and Natalie Shaffer. And in contrast to many ""tell-alls"" there are no sordid tales, or even profanity.I was somewhat surprised to hear how much he disliked Ronald Reagan personally. Almost seemed out of place in the book. Oh, well.Mr. Johnson is a great writer, and seems like a genuine Hollywood ""nice guy"".I'd like to meet him."
3,Written Just Like A Professor,"Even though he denies it, you almost get the feeling that Russell was writing this book in character. Or, maybe he WAS destined to play a part that stayed with him all his life. I guess if he had made money on the residuals, he would have had a different attitude.Still, you learn a little about Russell's life outside of playing The Professor on Gilligan's Island and that he was decorated WWII hero. You also get his take on all the other cast members with a pretty good idea that most of the crew basically tolerated Tina.Bottom Line- if you want to know more about the making of Gilligan, buy this as well as Bob Denver's autobiography but stay away from those focusing on Sherwood Schwartz."
4,Potential Adoptive Parent,"Wow.....my husband and I just started our home study for an older child adoption, and this is the first book we read on the subject. Grace Robinson is very discouraging. She provides NO redeaming reasons why anybody would want to adopt an older child. However, the book prompted us to have many long conversations about this searious endeavour we are undertaking, weather our marriage and extended family could handle adoption, etc. It encouraged us to look for even more books on the subject, and seek an adoptive parent's club for more perspective."
4,"Adopt an older child, its not easy, but it's rewarding!","Grace, paints a rather grim picture of what is to come, however, I think many of these are some worst case issues. If the Parent or Parents are informed on the child's issues and have done the needed research on each issue, as well as on what they want and need then it can work out great. Esp if you put the child's needs first, and that is one thing Grace does touch on! The child must be the most important thing in your life at that time. How many parents would hold a 12 yr old and give her a bottle, but with RAD, that is one of the bonding issues, and a way to help the bonding... If this book did not scare you away, then take the next step and start the process of adpting an older child."
5,Pleasing to the eyes and ears!!!!,This book really surprised me. It was well written and had lots of information for the single woman. I highly recommend it to any one who is at odds about what they want out of a relationship. I met the author at the Romance Slam Jam and I told him I was going to buy his book and let him autograph it. He politely told me that it was not a romance novel. I must admit I read it the same night. It was fantastic and I have recommended to all my friends. I give a high five to Mr. Crutcher and patiently wait for the next installment to the book.!!!!
2,Don't believe the hype!!,"Well, Well, Well, here goes another one. My girl's book club picked your book to discuss this month and my girl gave me your book to read. I am not in the least bit impressed. Mr. Crutcher, you supposedly wrote a book about the games men play. Brother, I am assuming you are black, do me a favor and get a real job. You give a lot of useless information about men. I am sorry to say this has got to be the worst book I have ever read. If you decide to write more books please stick to a topic you know about."
1,Buyers Beware - Not Very Impressive,"I was not very impressed with this book, at all. It was pretty predictable, therefore bored me. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It was a total waste of time and energy, lacking substance. I fought to finish(taking me a little over 31/2 weeks!)"
1,Nothing.....BUT HYPE,"Okay here it goes...2 reviews in one. My sister passed this book to me to get my opinion. As a man, I felt it was a bunch of bul****. I give the man his props (as a pretty boy, he's probably had his fair share of ladies), but this book ,from a heterosexual male perspective left much to be desired. It was basic, very general, and offered nothing. IMy sister, hated it. Lacked substance. She mentioned the book is so similar to so many other books out there with men trying to help women out by spilling our secrets. A total waste of time."
5,ATTN: ALL LADIES IN NEED OF ADVICE!! A MUST READ,"I bought this product about a month ago for a situation that I was a bit unfamiliar with. Well, because of the inspirational words from the author, I was able to carefully decipher the thoughts, actions and, words of the person without having to go through the extra ""drama"" in my life. He deserves praises for explicitly exposing what's really going on behind the scenes by publishing his book. Thanks to the author. I really hope that upon discovering this book, you'll decide to buy because I assure you, you'll never regret the decision you made.Also, thanks Amazon!!"
1,Misleading intent for writing this book,"This man became a Christian after having 'played' many women. This book needs to be advertised as being so..............this author hides his Christian intent.In life, you get what you give...........later, more intensely, and and too bad, so sad.Misleading title. This would be better advertised in a Christian venue."
5,Eye Opener,"Mark Crutcher has opened my eyes and showed me the truth about the dating scene. Goodbye fairy tale and rose colored glasses. The way he illustrates how ""players"" use their techniques to use women, very clear and to the point! CheckMate a must read for women who will be amazed to see what men are willing to do to stay in control and play them over and over again.What an empowering book!"
4,In A Time When Some Men's Games Are Becoming More Disingenuous....,Women need to arm themselves with this knowledge...Author OfBlack Women Deserve Better
2,Just Didn't Do Anything For Me,"I met the author at Black Images in Dallas and although I did not purchase the book at that time, I later decided to give it a try. I understand this is the author's first book, but it just didn't do anything for me. I passed it on to a girlfrind who couldn't even finish it. Keep on writing...there is some hope there. But, this book fell a bit short."
2,"The hits are here,but not the soul","The hits are here but it sounds as if it was recorded in the back of the room. The pure energy of the concert seems lost, or at least muted, by the way the album was mixed. The result is a soulless performance. Hopefully, someone will take another stab at capturing the energy these girls have on stage.... and hopefully soon."
1,Disappointed,"Oh, Midge, what a disappointment this album is to me. I heard 'Breathe' and loved it, bought the album, played it once.What a shame."
5,A breakthrough,"I cant beleive this book isnt bein published anymore. it was a ground breaker for me. I came from a seriously dysfunctional and abusive ""family""(the f-word to me). Before i read this book, i had no idea there was a logic or order to the chaos of an abusive household, I guess i was very naive. This book is the one that started me on my path to recovery from my past."
1,Pure new age garbage,"This book is terrible. Useless talk about""The inner child"" and extremely poor writting mar this so-called self help book. Help yourself, don't read it"
2,Substandard,"I frankly thougt it was a waste of money. When the first preogramming sample/example doesn't bother to tell you the basics, such as how and where to declare the variable so that the program will actually work, you know not enough thought was put into it. I often find the author's train of thought changing direction or jumping track completely; demonstrating ideas or features that he doesn't explain in full until several chapters ahead.This book will be confusing to a programmer with experience in another language and impossible for the first-time programmer. Mr. McKelvy et. al., you have got to be able to do better than this!I gave it two stars because the back cover and the snippets I read got me to believe this book was actually useful."
2,Not ideal...,"The mistakes in the programs annoyed me enough to write the publisher. That was about two months ago, I have yet to receive a reply. This book was definately rushed out the door. The ActiveX section was worthless. The typos, lack of clear directions and lack of response from the publisher make this book one to skip. On an up note, I'm now using the Visul Basic 5 Certification Exam Guide(McGraw Hill) and find it excellent. I'm sure they have it here."
3,"2nd Edition, does it live up to its hype?","Having read the reviews of the first ""Using Visual Basic 5 Special Edition"" book, I noticed that one person said that there where many mistypes and mistakes to the coding, he/she was right! I am a beginner to VB, although I have done some Qbasic and the second example in the book didn't work! What makes this worse is that Que's web site no longer has support or resources accompanying this book, no CD rom included either. Why I gave this book a 6? It is a very good book for starters ONLY if they manage to find out and fix the miscues in the book. If anyone has read this book, please email me about what you think..."
2,Not of Much Use,"For whatever reason, the trend in computer book publishing these days is to produce a thick book (1000 or more pages would be great), double spaced, with large fonts and low information density. This book is not double spaced.Although the cover bills it as a ""Special Edition"", ""Comprehensive"", ""Authoritative"", I did not find this to be true. In general, it covers the topics I was interested in, but the coverage is shallow and uninstructive. Each chapter tends to skip around haphazardly, without much of a unifying goal.The examples are poorly thought out, and often confusing. They illustrate only the most basic ideas. Many of the things you might want to do in a real application - standard things - are not covered. I found the chapter on database access and bound controls particularly disappointing.The book would be OK for a beginner, if there weren't some better beginner's books out there."
2,"Good book, if you pay attention while you read","I feel a little bit funny about this book : If you never seen VB in your life, it's a great source of information, with lots of examples and tips. On the other hand, it has so many errors and misprints, that if you're not an expert VB programmer, you might learn things wrong. I had the clear impression of handling a beta-version of the book. The fact that you have to download all the chapter's demos and samples from the book's website doesn't help much either."
3,Not much use,"I purchased this product so I could load my home pics into a screen saver. Right after obtaining, MSN upgraded their OS system to include this as a free option. I never even used the product...."
3,Can be made better with the right Professor,"As a past student of Dr. Bradford's, I can honestly say I don't know why anyone would choose to use this book either in their own course or in casual reading. Yes, it does provide some introductory grounding in Philosophy, but it is more a compendium of Dr. Bradford's philosophic views than a truly introductory text."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,This book is full of Contradictions! What a hypocrite!!! I would not recommend this is anyone unless they want a good nights sleep!
4,It's Okay But....,"... if you're serious about the chocolate and confectionaery arts consider adding ""Chocolates and Confections: Formula, Theory, and Technique for the Artisan Confectioner"" [Hardcover] by Peter P. Greweling to your list. Greweling goes into much more detail than Recchiuti does. I own both but find Greweling's book my ""go to"" manual."
2,Not so much...,"I'm a pastry student and I didn't like this book so much. I bought it because of the reviews on this page, and I'm disappointed with it. Now I want to buy the book of chocolates from CIA."
1,wrong delivery.,the picture in the ad is not what I received.I receive some small little peaces that I don't know what they are for. the cost is little so there is not value to send them back but I had to look again on what I needed
1,Foam Superman doesn't last long,Superman is foam with a hard plastic head and post thru the body. My son had this for 2 days when the foam split apart. It is also not that easy to launch for a child. Don't waste your money.
1,cheap material; poorly made,This toy won't last long in the hands of an active child; dosen't launch very well.
5,"SheSaidThat ""mom26andblessed""","The quality of this shirt is exactly as i would have expected it to be and I thoroughly enjoy it.The only other person here that commented on this and didn't buy it should probably shut up and stop commenting on things they don't even own. You have ruined what could have possibly become a 5 star review for the seller of this shirt. Lemmings ARE retarded. They are much like some religious people, they blindly follow that which has been placed in front of them to a fault..."
3,Not the same as the original album.,"I missed the album that I have, that's packed away, like most of my belongings right now, so I bought this CD. I was disappointed that some of my favourite songs are missing."
1,It should not get any star.,The mouse is an antique. Too many cables. How do they still sell it? They should sell it for $0.50.
5,Excellent Album,"I bought this album accidently several years ago, and it was a great mistake. It is one of my favorites. It is an all acoustic concert in a small restaurant in Amsterdam. I recommend it to everybody who appreciates great music. Its not an easy one to find, so buy it while you can."
4,Really nice camcorder...But one drawback.,"This is a great camera for the price. It has many useful functions that use to cost quite a bit more. The only problem I have with it is that you have to charge the battery on the camera itself. I'm sure this was just a way for Sony to cut their cost, and get people to buy more charger accessories. This kind of annoyed me when I opened the box, but the rest of the camera is great."
4,Pretty good camera,"I have owned my camera for over three years and have enjoyed it immensely. Contrary to what the specs say, it does have preset titles, and you can also make custom titles. It also has good quality pictures. I don't mind the battery charger, and I like being able to use the view finder or LCD screen. I have certainly gotten my money's worth. Too bad it's not a digital. It is a really good, dependable camera that is easy to use."
1,This camera Is terrible,"Like the other reviewer, My camera is about 6 months old and it doesnt work. Don't buy this camera or any camera from Sony. A friend of mine had a different model from Sony and that to doesn't work. Sony also does not care about their customers. So, I'm stuck with this worthless piece of junk."
5,From A big Elctronic fan,Wow for me a big Elctronic fan i just wanna say that it is a great cd . The deep Ambient sound and the beautiful voice of madona make this cd a great Tribue to Elctronic Pop Music its sound Like Depeche-Mode with the Specially vibe of William Orbit
1,do not buy this book,"It would be EXTREMELY foolish to buy this book. If you want to know your child, actually get to know them. So what if they are exploring different religions? Who says it will make them happy? They are teenagers, and that is what they do. They explore and try new things. They want to see if the way they are living now is the way they would like to live in the future. Its as simple as that. So why don't you jsut try to get to know your own child, instead of calling what he/ she is doing wrong. Because it is not. It is EXTREMELY SELFISH to force such things apon your child, just because YOU think it is right. They are humans too. And most likely a a lot more intelligent than you. They arent manipulated."
5,Great CD!!,Amazing ! ! ! Great CD. A great recording of this great artist. A great buy. I recommend. You can buy because it is very good.
5,Another Jon Lord Masterpiece,"""Before I forget"" is different from the other albums and I agree that it's not only for fans (like ""Windows"" and ""Gemini Suite"").You'll find some very beautiful tracks like ""Where are you my friend"" which is the one I most think about. Anyone who likes progressive music should buy this record - and someone who most likely forgot, should do it immediately, too.BEFORE I FORGET...Wonderful"
2,It takes feminism way too far.,"She uses a lot of references, but overall the subject matter could be made a hell of a lot more interesting. She can put you to sleep, which is unfortunate because there are still not enough attention on women in US history."
1,Please don't buy this,"I brought the iconcepts thumb keyboard from Compusa.It worked a little bit at first. Sometimes it typed and sometimesnothing. I put it away for 6 months and tried it again and this time nothing worked. I called customer service and they couldn't get it to work. So they said to mail it in and I'd get a new one, but I don't won't a new one. I'd rather give mine away now!Please don't buy this item.Onawecy"
1,Piece of junk locks up my Zen,"When I plug this cable into my Zen Vision: M 60GB, it locks it up; forcing me to reset the player. Then, for whatever reason, after I reset it and wait for it to Rebuild, it charges it just fine. You get what you pay for and I highly recommend not being dumb like I was. Just go pick up another Sync Adapter from Creative if you really need a second charger or sync cable."
1,Horrible...,"The cable will regonize my zen vision:m but it just fails when I try to put any actual music on the player. Not only did the cable succeed in not serving its function, but it also succeeded in locking up my player (which has yet to unlock as I am writing this review...) So if you want a device that doesn't tranfer data, freezes your zen vision, and is liable to break in a couple months (doesn't seem very sturdy), this is your product."
2,Cannot use this cable to transfer data,I was wanting a data cable to transfer music to my Zen. This is purely a power cable. You cannot transfer data with this.
5,Excelent fun,"I have only got this toy this summer but we have enjoyed it. We live on the river and swim in it constantly, my son (8 1/2) and I. It is so cool to see fish and the lights give enough light to see betewwn the rocks. It has been fun. It so far has held up well and the strap is pretty durable but seems ealy to replace if it does break."
2,Come on man....,"Toy requires a little rubber ""O"" ring for each of the battery tubes to keep water out. One of the ""O"" rings is missing from the tube...."
1,NOt so good........,Son bought these for himself and very disapointing. Can't see good at all under the water. Waste of money.
3,great (wile it lasted),we bought this for our trip to hawaii .the lights were uselessand the gogals were great for about 2 houres then the hole thing was useless wile they did work thought what i saw under the water was amasing but i would recomend a basick speedo pare they show you just as much and last for years (depending on the amount of use).
2,Nothing special,"Nothing special about this game. It's another first person shooter but with monsters, creepy backgrounds, and creepy cut scenes. Okay if you like those type of games."
5,You Will Have NightMares,"One Word: WHOA!!! This game is scary. I just got this game when it came out and have been playing it ever since. The graphics are great, the sound is very real, and it gives me the creeps when I play.The story is completely original and really gets your nerves going. Do not play this game at night. You will have nightmares."
4,Demo is great cant wait util this game comes out!,"I just played the demo on OXM and I will have to say this is one of the coolest, creepiest games I have ever played.The demo starts with Torq being led into death row. There is a whole lot of ""beeping"" the dialog so I cant wait to get the real version to see what it says. The dialog seems to fit with the prison setting and is very well done.Once in the prison all hell breaks loose, literally. All of these weird creatures start appearing, killing everything in sight. Its awesome!I dont want to give too much away I am preordering this game right now"
4,"Not really scary, but still pretty fun","Good atmosphere and game design make this better than average. I wouldn't say that I was ever really scared by it, but then it is just a game. There is an interesting collection of enemies and some decent, but basic, weapons. The story itself has some thought put into it and although it uses checkpoints, it also allows you to save whenever you want."
4,A must buy for any horror fan,"This game is much more action-oriented than your average survival horror game and for that it's worth buying if you're into horror and shooting games because it mixes both styles. The controls are great and the graphics are really good, although not as good as Silent Hill or Resident Evil. Value for money is great because you have 3 different endings and I am going through it 2nd time round, this time in hard mode.The only thing I thought was weak were the puzzles that could have substantiated the game. Nevertheless it has a great story, acting, controls and gameplay.."
5,The Suffering is awsume!,This game is one of the best games to be released ever! You start off in the game when you are sent to prison for murdering you're family. When you're in prison all hell breakes loose. You see a shadow behind the inmate infront of you and not scared you watch him die. Then you start to play the game. Everyone's dieng left and right infront of you. When you get to a cop who teams up with you go into the bathroom he was in and open the door. You're insanity will turn up and you're skin will slightly tear. Then kill the cop and you will see a bathtub with blood in it. after that go down stairs into the control room. Turn on the electricity and look in to the secerity camras. You will see someone behind you. Then kill one beast and you will tansform into a moster. It's not just a cowincidence that you're in prison there's a reson you're in there. The monsters will stop at nothing intill you turn into the monser PERMENITLY. This game is going to come out March 8.
4,Its about time!!,"Its about time somebody updated the horror genre. This game delivers a creepy, action pack experience not seen in traditional horror games like Silent Hill 2 or Res Evil. If you want puzzles you will not like this game. Its all about immersion, feeling like you are in this horrific environment. The world is very interactive unlike other survival horror games. You can use or destroy almost everything in the environment.This game is much more like Half Life or Max PAyne than Silent Hill.The graphics are good, but the shooting is awesome. And wait until you see Rage Mode, its incredible!Overall, this gets my vote as one of the best games of the year!"
1,Oh My Freaking Devil Child,This game is the most messed up game in the world. My child got it and he is scarred to sleep now. I am a police officer and i work the night shift and he is scarrd for me to go to the jail. Supposedly the game takes place in jail. He cries every time i leave. This kid is 18 and he is on the varsity football team at school and now this game has turned him into a whiny boy. If i was you i would NOT allow my child to get this game because it is obviously terrifyin. I am goin to sue the game manufacture for making this here horrible game. You've Been WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,He is one of the best!,"Like everyone else I first saw his Great Performances appearance years ago, more like 6 years ago now and was dazzled! I have looked for this video for a long time and am happy to find it now. It will be a treasure.Also of note for Michael Moschen fans: He did choreography for the new Cirque du Soleil travelling show ""Quidam"" and I beleive he remains associated with them."
4,You can't do that!!,"This video is incredible.I agree with some others, after you've seen the teaching parts and the cute family life part once, FF on by(I'm kind of insensitive that way), and his students just aren't as talented so after the first viewing I FF on by them as well.But MM juggling and the other stuff he does is mesmerizing. I've yelled, ""You can't do that"" more than once while watching this. It's Pact with the Devil kind of optically delusional stuff.Think ""geometry nerd finds acid"" and you'll get an idea."
5,The best juggler in the world,"I have not seen this tape but seen him on Maury Povich. He is AMAZING! He is the best juggler in the world. I am going to order this tape this week. he did a juggling thing where he is in a triangle frame and with a bunch of balls bouncing all over the place. And he has an act with crystal balls. I heard those tricks that he performed on Maury Povich he has on his tape so it is worth the money. I would be willing to pay $50 for it... lucky me, its only $20. GET IT NOW!!!"
3,Incorrect Fact,"I have to admit I was loving the book and thinking about buying it until I read one of the facts. It said that all spiders are carnivorous, yet it had a photo of the mostly herbivorous Bagheera kiplingli on the front cover. This spider eats acacia leaves and occasionally will eat meat but still it has a mostly herbivorous diet. So if you try to say, ""Well it still eats meat."", that would make it omnivorous (technically). Still an OK book though, just might be a little old or not studying all the facts."
5,Excellent book,"As an ""amateur"" on spiders (I do macrophotographies), I was searching more informations on these beasts. I found exactly what I was looking for. The Text is absolutly clear and the numerous figures are fantastic."
5,"The facts - clear, concise and thorough","This book was recommended to me by arachnologists everywhere as 'the gospel' on spider biology. There is a great deal of misinformation out there about spiders. This book provides the authoritative reference on the physical aspects of these incredible creatures. It covers every aspect of the physiology of spiders with clarity. It does not drop into jargon, but explains all of the scientific terms used. Foelix's book is essential for anyone who wants to have the most respected reference on the topic."
5,Easy to read and extraordinary,Easiliy readable and very profound in content. Not only a must reading for researchers in set theory but also the best introduction in mathematical logic.
4,Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis Review,It is a book that the most part of him is written in a naive form(not in formal logic).You need a basic knowledge of Set Theory(like Halmos Book).Very interesting and the book started from the root of the problem.Very Good
2,Hard read,"I wasn't expecting an easy read, but I'll wait to tackle this after I've absorbed ""The Joy of Sets"". Typographically, the meat of the book looks like it was photocopied off the original typewritten draft."
4,Dr. Dog is a great band,"I have found a new favorite band. I started with their album ""Be the Void"" and I was hooked. I recently ordered their entire back catalog and am continually amazed by how fun this band's music is. Highly recommended!"
4,Great for Second Grade,"I teach second grade in New York City, where the curriculum is the history of New York City, and this book is perfect. It provides a comprehensive and age appropriate description of life in New Amsterdam, couched in a compelling time travel story that keeps kids raised on the Magic Tree House engaged. I use it as a read aloud and it is both a big hit, and a cornerstone of my social studies teaching.Kids love it on their own as well."
4,Search over,"I've been searching for this book since childhood -- bless the internet for leading me back to this wonderful place. As New York grows ever more homogenized, with fewer landmarks to its history, this book and its story of Dutch days in New Amsterdam becomes ever more meaningful. Loved it as a kid, and still do."
2,Not what it looks like !,This is not Willie singing w/ Conway ! It has 5 songs by willie and 3 by Conway.
4,Excellent Introduction to 60s Beefheart,"I can't think of a better way to introduce yourself to the early Captain. One reviewer has quibbles aplenty with,'Electricity', but while understanding those, not for a moment would I pass up on this 'cheapie'. The soung quality is good to excellent, and the material is right out there with the most consummate stuff the Captain ever produced. The nucleus of, 'Safe is Milk' is here, if you haven't got it.'Sure 'nuff 'n Yes, I do', 'Zig zag' the title track,'Tarot plane,'Kandy Korn', 'Yellow Brick Road', the parody of the Beatles,'Stawberry Fields'; all this razzles and dazzles, just as it did in the 60s. That's presence!"
1,Warning this is a mono recording,"Beware this is a Mono recording, and quality of recording is weak. They could have at least issued re-mix ( the tunes are good). Eric Gale is in my top ten guitarist. Reading the other reviews, I thought this was a safe bet, but I am disappointed.There probably is not enough demand for a re-mix, Eric died in 1994. I do not usually write reviews, but I feel that this album is mis-represented on the site. I just want to give others a heads up, before they buy."
5,Excellent B&W Book,"I found this to be just what I was looking for in a digital B&W book. The author gives a basic overview of digital cameras and equipment, shows a couple of different ways to convert a digital colour file to B&W and spends most of the time with ways to make money. This was perfect for me. Too many authors I feel are intellectuals with no real world experience. This author obviously has a viable portrait and wedding photography business. His images and those of others that he chose to include are salable. This is real world photography. Excellent book for anyone that wants to make money shooting digital B&W photographs."
2,A book for entry level,"Overall, book is well organized and written for a beginner but it is far from covering advanced techniques and methods. Good starter book but far from being professional."
4,Good about the inner workings of Photography,"This is an excellent book, however, it wasn't what I was expecting. I was looking for a How To book. This was more about the aesthetics and philosophies. The nitty gritty comments were excactly what I needed.I write Travel Photography books and would like to eventually have my books on Amazon.Photographic Reflections by Joleene"
5,Great Book.,This book is great for teaching you about black & white photography. Gives you all the info you need to take the picture and how to manipulate in photoshop.Black & White photography is really hot right now. But there is a right and wrong way of doing it. In this book Patrick Rice walks you through all that you need to know to produce AWESOME black & white images that your clients will LOVE.
5,Exceptional Black & White book,"As a portrait and wedding photographer, I found this book helpful and inspirational. The portrait images are quite stunning and the wedding pictures gave me lots of new ideas to use on my own weddings.There are some nice black & white landscape photos in the book, but that really isn't my area of expertise.It is a very, very good black and white book."
2,Disappointing,"This book is not what I had expected at all. Producing fine black and white images in digital form is not easy and I was expecting all sorts of information on doing B&W conversions from colour files, but there's very little of that. It has very little good information on producing a professional standard digital black and white at all. The author talks a lot about very basic digital stuff such as selecting a camera, basic lighting for digital, exposure for digital and composition, everything you see here can be found in dozens of other books. The REAL info on fine quality professional B&W is either missing or just barely touched on. He does have quite a bit of info on Infrared but he has authored a different book on that subject so why the extended coverage in this book? There is info on special effects such as handcolouring that is interesting but the info on producing fine B&W that I was hoping for is missing. A disappointment."
3,"Title should include ""Wedding Photography""","Patrick Rice must be a wedding photographer. What other reason would there be for all the wedding and portrait photos in the book? The title should be ""Black & White Digital Wedding Photography."" Even though the content is applicable to other types of photography, the overwhelming number of wedding and portrait photos makes it difficult to imagine any other type of photography while reading the book."
1,A disappointment,"This book lacked information on most of the things one would expect given the title, such as exposure response of digital cameras, contrast control, grain control, lighting, and digital manipulation. It contained a lot of images which often were not tied at all to the text, lacked captions, and were boring. Some of the images seemed to be examples of what not to do, but were not labeled as such, given one the impression that the author was proud of these crummy pictures he took. Two things that were covered in some detail were making ragged looking borders and infrared b/w photography - both gimmicks. In all, there wasn't a great amount of text and little to help the reader improve his photography."
4,new learning techniques.,"this is not the common photography book that tells you the aperture and speed setting. this is more towards the artistic sideof photography that you do not read in other photo books. you will uncover new things that you don't find elsewhere.the photos here are impressive, the only problem is that most of the photos here are not from the author...duh?"
4,ZIGGY SAYS THEY ARE A BIT TOUGH TO CHEW...,"... but he likes them. I was told by Ziggy's doctor to give him up to 3 per day. They are larger than he likes - he is an African Grey Congo - so I try to ""quarter"" them and I just place them in his food bowl. He seems to like them, but I do find it hard to believe even parrots can naturally chew these. Not sure why they make them so HARD. Harrisons makes good, natural products. Sometimes I add a different brand of bird pellet in with the usual Harrisons Everyday and their High Potency pellets for variety. I also add cutup carrots, snap peas, walnuts, grapes, broccoli, etc., to his bowl. He likes air-popped pop corn. No oil is used and I only put salt and butter on the ones I am going to eat!! Harrisons has great customer service. If you have a question, just send them an email and they will get right back to you. That is totally impressive."
5,Happy CAG,Harrison's power treats are a big hit at my house. My gray picks them out of her bowl and eats them first.
2,Post office section is small,"This book says it covers the Post Office KSA'S. It covers about one third of the KSA required to get a supervisors job. The rest and not even discussed. I am still looking for the book which shows all of the KSA's, this book is not the one I wanted."
4,Medical Records Technician,"I bought this book for my husband. Hek, this book is fantastic. We utilize the information, converted it to his present job and he went from GS-5 to GS-6/7/8. It is good for both straight civilians and former military people if you know how to use it. Would be a 5 star if it had KSA's for the medical field."
1,Smart to avoid,"There is absolutely no one to care about in this movie, which really makes it a waste of time to watch. The character development is non existent. We take a group of pathetic people and watch them evolve into semi-pathetic people. I laughed twice.Note: Typical Hollywood jabs at conservatives too. The daughter in the movie is growing up in her father's loathsome shadow. As a result, she is becoming hateful,reclusive, and unable to have fun. So (naturally), they make her a member of local chapter of the young republicans. This has absolutely no purpose in the film other than to characterize Republicans as hate mongers that are incapable of relaxing or having fun."
4,Discover Ellen Page,"This is a solid three star movie, but I elevated it to four stars because of Ellen Page. It's the first time I've seen her, and what a great surprise. She dominates every scene she's in--even those with Thomas Haden Church--and she does it with perfectly-honed understatement. Lillian Gish once said (something to the effect): ""never let 'em catch you acting,"" and Ellen Page doesn't.UPDATE (9-5-09): I have seen two more of Ellen Page's films. ""Juno"" for which she received an Oscar nomination, and ""An American Crime"" in which she was downright outstanding. She reminds me of the great French actress, Isabelle Adjani, [who, coincidentally, was the same age as Ms. Page when she received an Oscar nomination for her powerful performance in ""The Story of Adele H."" (1975), the setting for which--though not filmed there--is Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Page was born and raised]."
3,Where is the Smart... in the People?,"Very fine acting, but conventional and uninspired plot. Dialogues unrealistic and the characterizations stereotypical. Are ""smart"", or academic, types supposed to talk and behave as these characters? Don't think so -- this is from someone from a family where all 4 kids went to Ivy schools - Harvard, Yale... There are doctors and professors (math and music) in the family. I don't recognize any of the characters or their behaviors except for the step brother. It seems that the director wanted to capture the audience with quirkiness rather than intelligent interaction, and the writer went for ""wits"" instead of real ""smarts""."
2,Why Bother ?,"Given the cast I was looking forward to this movie.I have appreciated Dennis Quaid since Breaking Away. However, what is going on here? His performance feels so inconsistant. At one point it's like he's doing a bad Donald Sutherland imitation on zanax. Stop the freaking mumbling! Sarah Jessica Parker was just so dessipated and mundane. She flatlined. The supporting cast's work which at times was favorably noteworthy, could not balance out Mr. Quaid and Ms. Parker's downward spiral. At times the script offered a little something something, but for the most part this poorly metered, badly directed movie was numbing. There was nothing redeeming to be found in the set designs, hair styles, lighting, interiors... no where to run! It all just contributed to the uncomfortable fragmented muddy design of this boring production."
4,smart people,"I purchised the dvd smart people, i found this to be a good product, works well and in very good condition!"
3,This movie was underrated.,"I don't understand why this movie got such bad reviews. I really enjoyed it and thought the cast was brilliant. The script wouldn't stand out on it's own given a mediocre cast but SJP, Ellen Page, and Dennis Quaid really brought this movie to life. I thought it was a cleverly done dramedy and if you appreciate these actors and that kind of film, I think this movie is definitely worth a watch."
2,"Smart People? Uh, more like ...""Dumb Movie""","Formulaic caricatures comprise this thin plot line. Dennis Quaid is haggard, cast as a misanthropic, self-absorbed English professor. Sarah Jessica Parker is not credible as the high-heeled E.R. doctor who has time to casually chat up her patients and give injections that are usually delegated to nurses. Ellen Page reprises the implausibly wisecracking character in ""Juno,"" sans the teen pregnancy. Thomas Hayden Church delivers his flat catatonic lines as though he is on anti-depressants. (I wish I had some before inserting this DVD...)Add in a creepy semi-incestuous romantic relationship between the desiccated uncle and a teenaged niece and you have a recipe for a real stinkeroo.To buy into this movie, you not only have to suspend your disbelief, you have to suspend your intelligence.I had high hopes for the movie and had read the positive reviews but would recommend you pass on this one..."
2,Smart People,Why is it that so many movies rely on the pain of loosing a spouse to set up the dysfunctional family that results from this loss? Smart people is shot in a color pallet that tends toward grey which is also the color of the mindset of this cast. Ellen Page proves she can provide life to an otherwise hopeless film. The rest of the cast seems uninspired and disconnected.
2,WHY would anyone make this film?,"""Smart People"" is a film you watch,and have no idea WHY?I've been a fan of everyone in the movie,and there all great,but WHY would you make a movie like this?You have no idea Why these charaters are interested in each other.No wonder they released ""Smart People"" after Ellen Page's huge hit ""Juno."" That's the only SMART thing they did."
3,Is this really the way smart people think of themselves?,"Much as I admired Dennis Quaid's performance in this film, it bothers me that the director buys into the myth of ""brain smart--heart stupid"" so glibly--a decidedly anti-intellectual message. It's just another example of bigotry masquerading as comedy."
5,Dennis Quaid and Thomas Haden Church Have Great Chemistry,"I know everyone has talked about Ellen Page in this film (who's great) but an added bonus was the surprisingly terrific chemistry between Dennis Quaid and Thomas Haden Church as brothers. This is not the first time Quaid has played a writing/humanities professor (see the late '80s remake of D.O.A.), but it is a first in terms of the approach he takes. While he has lost his way a little bit (as have most cinematic profs), he's helped back on course through an unusual and effective narrative design maneuver -- the reappearance of an adopted brother played by Thomas Haden Church. True, the lead female character (the aptly named Dr. Hartigan) also helps revive Quaid's character, but the camaraderie between the brothers really is the main attraction."
3,Not what it was said to be...,"I selected a new DVD for this purchase. When I got it in the mail the product was open, clearly used, and the package was even slightly damaged. I contacted the seller and she reimbursed me fully. I would have rather had the new product, but appreciated the refund."
4,Perfect for people who want to eliminate their mouse!,"I bought this because I quite literally sit in front of a computer keyboard all day. I prefer to use my left hand, however, my wrist burns and I'm forced to wear a brace so I moved the mouse and began using it with my right hand and found my shoulder ached like no tomorrow (listen to me whine, I know...). Anyway, I thought the ideal place to have a mouse was right in front of me so I began my search and came up with this keyboard. For me, it is the perfect solution! I mostly use the keyboard shortcuts vs. my mouse anyway. This mouse is a lot like one you'd find on a laptop but it has a scroll feature, which is nice. I think the space bar is a little loud but I have no way of knowing if it is just this keyboard or all their keyboards in general. Either case, I'll get over it. For the price, I don't think this is a bad deal at all especially if you are looking to eliminate your mouse!"
4,"Part Review, Part Question","Okay first the ""review"", obviously I haven't watched this DVD set yet as it has yet to be released but I remember these being two of the best seasons of this awesome show, even if it doesn't have the tons of extra features I am hoping for I'll most likely buy it.Okay, now the question: Does anyone know if this has any extra special features that weren't already on the Season 5 DVD set and the Season 6 DVD set??"
1,Reconditioned Tool needed to be Reconditioned,"Saw came in with a warped base plate. Too bad. Sent it back and bought the Milwaukee equivalent. Probably just the luck of the draw, but QC could obviously be much better."
4,Works well,"Improved my tangles, but not as much as I had hoped. My hair still gets tangled when I use this product, but it is less. Smells great and feels nice. I would still recommend this product. It is expensive though so I wish it worked a little better that is why I only put 4 stars. I have to use a leave in detangler as well as this in order to get my tangles out."
5,Who let the dogs out?,"Henry Horenstein, that's who. A master photographer, his black and white photographs are studies in light, shadow and texture. Horenstein, whose evocative book ""Creatures"" made artworks of crocodile teeth and fish lips, has captured in ""Canine"" the very Essence of Dog. A must-have for any dog lover, or photography buff."
4,"Good Quality, Great Price !","This is a great camcorder for starters. The Night Shot (witch is really infared) is one of the best things Sony could of put on Thier camcorders. The remote is nice when you are watching the viedo ar tape recording it so you don't have to get up. The 2.5 in. LCD I could live without because it dosent have that very good of clarity. The only real diffrence that it has between digital camcorder is it's abilty to do computer editing and the abilty of being a digital camera, anyways the quality of the digital camera feature is really poor. Steady shot is a good feature for amature camera people. The thing that really took me in suprise is the top notch zoom which is top of the line when I wrote this. All in all it is a good camera for a good price."
5,Excellent Video Camera w/ lots of extras!,"I bought this camcorder back in July and I have enjoyed it ever since. I have taken a lot of footage of skateboarding in my area and such. All I need to do is find a cheap fish-eye lens, and some cables to go to my PC. Can anyone help me find the right cable for this camera to a PC? Thanks. Joelizlar@mediaone.net"
1,Item arrived damaged and appeaered to not be in original condition,"When I received this product, the box appeared to have been used. The box was beat up, bent, and not in new condition. When I pulled out the jar of cream, the lid on the jar WAS NOT in new condition; I could tell it had been used, part of the symbol on the top of jar and the gold coloring was rubbed off. The seal between the jar and the lid was broken. I was not sure what to think, so I just sent it back. I decided to purchase from a local department store where I knew the product I was purchasing was new."
1,Keyboard is a PAIN!,"Not much to say about the screen protectors, styluses, or case, but the keyboard is built horribly! First of all, there is no information about how to put the keyboard on or take it off (even though it SHOULD be self-explanatory). I tried to put it on first without the black protector that comes with the iPAQ, but it was a very loose fit. So I put it on with the case, and it fit perfectly. The only problem is, I can't get the keyboard off now. The release button grabbed onto my iPAQ, but won't RELEASE! I can't sync-up to my computer anymore, or put it in ANY case because the keyboard is too thick.When I called iConcepts tech support, I was told to press the release button. Since that obviously didn't work, they said there was nothing else they could do."
3,a mixed bag,"I had never heard this album and was a little disappointed. It has a great stereo sound and the material is generally good, but it`s a little too much brass and rhythm for me. AND THE ANGELS SING is my pick of the bunch with a Latin beat. Perhaps more change of pace might have pleased me more."
2,Not up to date,"This book has some good pictures and it does describe general characteristics of the uromastyx but it does not go into great detail on species specific care. Also, the list of species is not up to date which is indicative of it's out dated information."
5,Excellent Learning Tool,"Wow! I highly reccommend this prduct to anyone who has commnunication problems in the workplace , or anywhere else in their life. By using the idioms in this book I got a promotion at work .Thanks."
1,Terribly Disappointed,"I am so terribly disappointed in Ina's third book Barefoot Contessa Family Style that it prompted me to write my first customer review ever! I absoluletly love her first two books. Family Style is grasping to fill pages with basic recipes such as mashed potatoes, herbal ice tea, apple pie, scambled eggs and mac and cheese. The book is lacking the stlyishness and finesse her first two books offered. The recipes in her first two books are creative and inspire you to be resourceful in your entertaining! It appears this book was frantically pulled together before the holiday spending frenzy just to make a few bucks or perhaps the success of her first two books and recent TV show has gone to Ina's head making her think we will rush to purchase her third book regardless of it's lackluster content. I wish I had not purchase it."
5,"Exceptionally simple, practical and delicious","All of her books are outstanding. The recipies are tasty, simple, and composed of few ingredients. I highly recommend all of her cookbooks."
4,The tequila lime chicken was the best grilled chicken I've ever had!,"I had never heard of Ina Garten before I bought this book, and so had no idea about Barefoot Contessa or anything, but the tequila lime chicken was the most tasty grilled chicken I've ever tried. I am really excited to try more of these recipes. Some of them seem a little simplistic to me and are things that I already know how to make (like mashed potatoes) but the dessert section looks great and I am considering buying one or two of the other BC books. Very impressive and the photographs inside the book are gorgeous. I would recommend adding this to any cookbook collection."
4,"Easy, tasty food in this book","I was given this book as a gift and have made many things in it already. I have liked all so far and the nice thing is that they are simple to make. No weird ingredients that you'd have to hunt down. I have noticed though that she uses generally more salt than my liking, but maybe not a problem for most. I will be looking for more books by her. Mmmm..."
4,My mother will love it.,"This was just what I was looking for to give the cook in my family. No really exotic recipes she'll never use, but easy and better ways to make favorite dishes."
5,Perfection,"I have every cookbook Ina Garten has written and have never been disappointed. I have used her recipes for dinner parties, friends and family and even as a charity dinner auction item. The latter was very popluar, and have been asked to donate again. All recipes we used were from her cookbooks. Wouldn't be without them! I also give them as gifts when people want to have my 'recipes'."
5,A California Cook,"I think this is an excellent cookbook. I've made several things from it (Chicken Noodle Soup, Sunday Rib Roast, Creamy Mustard Vinaigrette) and all were excellent. I've only had the book a few days, but I know that it will be well used after reading it cover to cover. The pictures are beautiful and the menus at the end are helpful. I think this would be an exellent gift as well."
2,Dissapointing,"I love Ina's cooking show and I decided to buy one, I did that after reading the raving reviews. Getting the book, it was huge disappointment. There is not that many spectacular recipes in the book. I would rather recommend a latest find on the shelf that came out recently Catherine's Kitchen ISBN 1420832123. It contains great appetizers and a fantastic mexican soup that is to die for, it also have a couple of anekdots that are very entertaining to read. This book I find a gem amongst a whole ray of cookbooks that is out there. Ina's book is a kind of waste of money. I will save my money and just watch her on the foodnetwork show."
3,"Good, not the best out there, but might suit you fine...","The author provides some helpful recipes and tips, but I can't help to wonder why she insists on encouraging the oversalting almost all of the food she prepares. She also seems to have almost no formal training whatsoever (nor do I, but I recognize bad technique when I see it), and a fairly crude approach if you ask me. Trying to be a ""poor-man's"" Martha Stewart or a more ethnic version maybe, but I don't quite get it. I would recommend picking up a book by Emeril, Rachel Ray (30 Minute Meals) or one of the other Food Network personalities first, but if this book contains more of the recipes you want, then I say go for it...what's the harm, plus you can always adjust foods to your tastes or diet. If you're wanting to entertain for groups or cocktail parties this will help you add a few more dishes, for sure."
5,Great Item,It fit true to the description and how I expected it to be. Worked great for my sister's xmas present!
5,INA GARTEN HAS THE #1 BEST COOKBOOKS,INA GARTEN HAS THE BEST COOKBOOKS I EVER PURCHASED. THEY INSPIRE YOU TO COOK. BEAUTIFUL PICTURES AND TERRIFIC TO READ.
2,Disappointing,"I love Ina's first two books- in fact, they are my favorite cookbooks. I am so sorry to say that her much-anticipated third book was disappointing. While the parmesan chicken and frozen key lime pie were acceptable, the other recipes did not have the same appeal. I agree with the other reviewers who write that it seemed that she hurried too much with this one. Regardless, I am looking forward to her fourth book."
4,barefoot contessa family style,We were very impressed with the layout of the recipes of this book. These recipes were very easy to understand and always turned out. I purchased one for myself and one for my friend.
5,I love ALL the Barefoot Contessa cookbooks!,"After watching Ina Garten, The Barefoot Contessa, on the Food Network, I had to have ALL her books! As a collector of cookbooks, most may have one, maybe two, recipes I actually use. This is not the case with the Barefoot Contessa books. Her recipes are fast and easy enough for cooks who want to cook at home, but want recipes that do not require hours and hours in the kitchen. The results are delicious and special enough for having the family over or when guests are expected."
5,Every recipe is a success,"I got this cookbook as a gift and what a gift it has turned out to be! Every recipe turns out so well. I often have people ask for the recipe when I use this cookbook. Some of the recipes are a little salty for me, but I don't like a lot of salt in my food and no one else has ever had a problem with it."
5,"Love Ina, love the book","The recipes in this book are relatively simple to make and delicious. I love the pictures that go with the recipes. This is my second Ina Garten cookbook, and I love it as much as her original cookbook. Your dinner will take on just a hint of class when using the recipes in this book. Very easy, but somewhat sophisticated."
5,Great Gift Item,I have this book in my own library and find that it makes an excellent gift for your fellow foodies and hostesses. I like to highlight a favorite recipe in the book and send along with a gift certificate to a local supermarket to encourage them to explore new dishes.
3,Average cookbook,"Most of the recipes have photos, which made the book delightful to browse. I'm sure these are tasty, delicious recipes but nothing appealed to me enough to want to try and fix myself. Most of them seemed fairly easy for the average cook. This is a book that will charm some foodies but not all."
2,Disappointing,"I love the previous Barefoot Contessa cookbooks, but there are very few recipes in the new book that have the wow factor. The originality seems to be lacking in this new cookbook. I was so excited to receive the cookbook, but after reading it I should have saved my money."
4,Good & Simple Recipes,"These recipes are easy to understand and simple to make. I made a few right away and they turned out fine. It's a little harder on the kindle than using a book, but its probally just a matter of getting use to the change. I recommend this book also for the helps on entaining. I plan on using it a lot."
1,Big Disappointment,"This is a beautiful cookbook with enticing pictures, but the food does not hold up. I have cooked many of the recipes. The cooking times are consistently innacurate (most are way too long) and the food is bland. With the exception of the Parmesan Chicken, which is wonderful, I haven't found anything I would serve to guests and very few recipes I would even repeat at home. I've been to the Barefoot Contessa, and it's wonderful. It's impossible to believe, based on this cookbook, that it's the same person..."
2,A Dissapointing Third Outing for Ina,"I also had very high hopes for Ina's latest. But ""Family Style"" is woefully uninspired. She features a recipe for roasted asparagus - wasn't that in one of her previous cookbooks?? If not, a reader of her earlier offerings could just duplicate the instructions for her roasted carrots (first book) or roasted cherry tomatoes (second book). I own the thing now, but don't see myself turning to it half as much as I do the other two. Could it be that the Barefoot Contessa is played out and has nothing new to offer? From the looks of ""Family Style,"" I'd have to surmise as such."
5,Ina Garten is the best,Ina's recipes are very easy to follow and turn out perfect. She is probably the best chef I have found.
5,More Delicious Offerings from Ina Garten!,This is a fabulous cookbook with more of Ina Garten's mouth watering receipes. I love all of the recipes in this book!
1,Unfit for Giving or Receiving,"I had such high hopes for this cookbook, thinking that it would be a perfect holiday gift for several people on my list. After ordering it, however, all I can say is that I'm glad I didn't ship it direct. While beautifully photographed and put together, the book is woefully short on substance. I've found more original recipes in my civic association's monthly newsletter. The whole reason I'm back at Amazon.com today is to find replacement gifts, since I'd be too embarrassed to give this to anyone."
5,Love Barefoot Contessa,This is my first Barefoot Contessa cookbook and every thing I have made from her has turned out great. I just love that all of her recipes are winners.
5,Unbelievably good stuff,"Wow. Heard a cut from this album on the radio and HAD to have it. And I was rewarded - not a song on this album is not a 5-star effort! It's all good. I had not heard of a Chapman stick before this - but sure hope to see another CD soon! If you like acoustic guitar, this will definitely float your boat too!"
4,"Get Hip, Hipsters",Awesome cd from an awesome band. One of the best releases of 2002. Buy this than go see them when they come to a town near you.
2,Nothing to it,"This record is a complete waste of material. There are notes, chorus, verses...but the sound is just plain and boring...after the first 3 songs you don't want to listen anymore. Fortunately for me, this album only costed me 23 mexian pesos (about 2 dlls). An advice...dont buy it."
5,Outstanding!,"Mitchell gets it! This book was right on the money. From both intellectual and visceral perspectives this book is dead on. I flew through the pages, had a hard time putting it down. It's clear the author is in tune with the world around him and has a deep appreciation for that world."
5,healing sound,like wind... How sophisticated his plays are! It's pity that Amphibious Consciousness series are temporarily suspended. Fevian Reza Pane is one of the greatest pianist in Japan.
5,Haydn: Nelson Mass,"Haydn: Nelson Mass is a recording under the direction of Richard Hickox who leads the City of London Sinfonia on the first 11 tracks on this Decca recording from 1985. The last 2 tracks are under the direction of Chistopher Hogwood who leads Handel & Haydn Society and starring Arleen Auger (soprano). Kenneth Chalmers essay ""Missa in angustiis ('Nelson Mass')"" is very informative and well-written. Highly recommended. 5/5."
5,Great!,"My son received this on the 19th of October, 2011.He has not taken this costume off.Loves wearing it on around the house, wore it to a Nature center today.He wore his winter boots with it. They are a size 9. He is 3.5 years old. Wears 2T pants and 3T shirts. He is not very tall. The costume fits him perfect with his boots.So, if your son or daughter is tall, you may consider a different shape of footwear.Perfect costume."
4,Despite the title this appears to be a scholarly work.,"I recently had an opportunity to glance at this book. The title makes it sound like a coffee-table book, but in fact it consists of hundereds of mini-investigations into the sources of very well-known pieces of music. Footnotes include references to other works and to primary sources. Recommend to anyone with an eclectic desire for information on music."
1,Keep Away from Kids!,My five year old loves Superman and got this for his birthday. After about two minutes it was spread all over the house and in my youngest son's hair. It took 1/2 an hour in the tub and 10 minutes to comb the stuff out of my son's hair. It is even extremely difficult to get off of your hands. It was a mess and I can't see why this is marketed to ages 4+.
2,"Fun, but not sure about recommending it","That said, it is a bunch of fun. Ours didn't drip as indicated in the review below, but it did dry out quickly and become hardened even after storage in the container. It is fun to use but the price here is atrocious. We got ours for two dollars at our local krogres store. That's all I'd pay for it too!"
3,Kryptonite Slime,"Although the package description makes the compound sound similar to Silly Putty, this product is much more like Slime. You need to keep it away from more than the dog! After a minute or two, my 6-year-old had it stretched into fine webbing and stuck all over his hands. It took at least a half an hour to rub it all off. It also tends to drip. The user needs to take care to keep the compound moving; it behaves similar to corn starch/water, in that it starts to spread when idle.Although I can best describe this compound as a cross between green bubble gum and cornstarch paste, it was fun to play with."
4,Solid as usual!,"We purchased this Super40 series Flowmaster for our 2006 Tahoe and it produces a nice growl that is a little different from the original 40 I have on our 2001 Tahoe in that the interior resonance is cut in half.I enjoy the in your face growl of the original 40 on mine and it made sense to go with the super 40on hers having kids in the truck all the time,but come summer its windows down listening to it roar.Never the less another awsome product from Flowmaster,never have and never will be disappointed with their product.Flowmaster has always been king of keeping V8 muscle sounding/feeling american.Brent"
5,flowmaster 40 series on chevy silverado 07 4.8l,So I bought the 40 series on here and I looked around a little first I like this muffler a lot great deal for sure. It's not too loud but I would get something just a tad quieter. She roars.
2,Disappointment!,"I am a fan of Sephardic and Yiddish music, so I was looking forward to listening to this. I was specifically looking for Yerushalayim Shel Zahav (Jerusalem the Gold), and yes, this album contains that song, but I had to stop the CD before the song ended. About half of the songs on this album are sung rather well, but THIS was not one of them. Perhaps mezzo-sopranos have trouble controlling their pitch at high volume and/or slow tempo and I should just be more understanding. Perhaps I am completely spoiled by the perfect tenor I can hear each Shabbat -- Hazzan David Propis. (If you can find his CDs, you will be glad you did.) Whatever the ""handicap,"" today I was looking for a good soprano voice in this genre, and it seems I must continue the search...."
5,This game is great!,"This game is sooo much fun! I just got it yesterday and have almost been playing it 24/7. Its really good. You can us up to six characters including (of course) Buffy and (my favorite) Faith, who kicks major butt. I highly suggest you buy this game! It's a lot of fun."
5,Summer's Best,"Absolutely among the finest recorded versions of this work. Ashkenazy and the Philmarmonia bring us all the freshness of summer just as Beethoven has tranferred it into music. The atmophere is totally relaxing and the rainstorm surreal. You almost feel the thunderstorm passing, and washing away the day's stress. It is a pity that this exquisite music making partnership did not finish a complete cycle as they also performed superbly well together in Symponies 5 and 7, another buy recommendation"
1,not worth it!,"A more accurate description of the contents: 8 brown paper bags, 8 pieces of ribbon, 8 bic-type pens, cheap corkscrew like they give away in the liquor store, 8 postcard invites printed black on white (oh, one splash of color for a line of type and the wine in the glass), 8 rings of paper that you can put around the bottom of the glass to id your glass, a decent wine ratings card (8), includes how to taste on the reverse, a 12 page booklet on how to throw a party. The kit's main purpose is to get you to form a club and buy more kits. Perhaps I'm a little jealous of its creators! Don't forget to add tax and shipping! Save your money and just do a little research on wine tasting; and buy some decent party supplies!"
2,Disappointing,This book has instructions for 24 quilts with only 4 I would consider making -- and 2 are similar to quilts in other books. I was quite disappointed in the book and do not consider it to be worth the cost.
4,Inspiration for all . . .,"Javed Mohammed is a friend whom I have grown to respect and trust in our sporadic time together. He is a thoughtful man, one who is dedicated to his profession and his religion. In this book he shares some of the inspirational thoughts, readings, and speeches that he has come across in his life experience. He shares them with us, providing insights and introspection that is well worth our time.We can, after reading this wonderful volume, be ready to gather our own gems throughout the day. Tom Campbell (US Congressman - R/CA) put it well: ""A must read for all American youth and adults. This book informs and illuminates the way through inspirational Muslim literature."""
4,A great book for both young and old.,Javed Mohammed did a great service to all people when he wrote his book. The Islam he loves and writes about is the Islam that I have experienced in many parts of the world. He and Rumi would have gotten on well.
5,True Inspiration for Human Beings,"I am a Muslim living in the United States, and this book is the first one in a long time that made me feel proud to be Muslim. It also made me feel good to be alive. If you need a small book to carry with you for daily inspiration, this is the one."
4,"Excelent quality, but...","I did some research before I chose this unit and I don't regret it. This one has great picture quality. It lets you easyly choose between, text, standard, movie, gaiming and photo modes which really make a difference. In photo mode for example, the pictures look way better.Ignore the bad reviews about the glossy screen. I have a HP Dv4000 laptop with glossy screen so I knew it would not be a problem. It makes your images look so much better. Just adjust the light in your office and enjoy better color and contrast it gives you.This is a great LCD, why four stars then? if only this monitor had height adjustment! That is the only thing I am missing. I put it side by side with a Dell 1907fp to use dual mons and I had to bring the dell half a foot down to make it level with the NEC. The dell has excellent adjustments and beautiful design too. I have to hack the NEC somehow cuz I wanna keep it."
2,"Good Cartoons, severely cropped!","The cartoons could be fun to watch, but they are severely cropped on all four sides, which means characters are often only partially visible etc. Think abaout it twice even for this great price."
1,DVD,"Bought wrong product, I confused with the ""cat & mouse"" Tom & Jerry, but this was not the cat & mouse, at the time I bought it, it didn't show me the cover of dvd. I did not have any interest in this particular classic cartoon."
5,Great cheap collection of rare cartoons.,This DVD is a great bargain for the price. This DVD contains rare cartoons of the original Van Beuren studio's Tom & Jerry. If you are a fan of Fleischer Studio and other east coast style animation you will really enjoy these shorts.
1,disappointed,It is one of those old cartoons were characters don't speak and the humour is very infantile...all of this into an unattractive display and not creative enough for the nowadays viewer
5,SEAHAWKS DOOR MAT,MY DAUGHTER IS A HUGE SEAHAWKS FAN ! THEY JUST BOUGHT A HOUSE AND THIS MADE AN AWESOME HOUSE WARMING PRESENT.ONLY DRAW BACK IS THAT SHE WONT LET ANYONE STEP ON IT. ! ON THE PRODUCT.. QUALITY ! IF I AM EVER IN NEED OF A RUG LIKE THIS AGAIN I WILL BUY FROM THIS COMPANY !
2,NOT overly impressed..,A decent enough door mat but it wearing out on the very front edge (losing the blue coloration) after only a few months of actually use..Probably would not purchase it again..
1,Here is one more money saving tip,"I have been reading lots of these types of books of late so I feel that i have a pretty good sense of what is good and what is not.Here is tip number 61: dont buy this book, it is so simple and basic that only a 15 year old starting out with his first job could possibly find the content useful. Instead I would purchase ""The Wealthy Barber,"" a useful and timeless classic, and its Canadian content is a plus.If you are still curious then follow this advice instead, go to the bookstore and spend 10 minutes reviewing the headlines in each chapter. There is not much more depth beyond those words."
3,SO so....,"idk what to say. 2 great underground hiphop artists, im just not feeling this album. cage is one of the best music artists ive ever heard and my music i listen to varies. to me this is something to listen to once or twice, not one id be playing alot. cage-hells winter... now thats were its at!"
2,sadly not as good as i had hoped,"I got this album the day it came out cause i'm a huge MHz fan, and I'm sort of feeling some of Cage's joints, and thought this CD would be dope. I was so wrong. I don't know how to describe it, any other way than below average. The whole project just bores me. A lot of my friends who own this or have listened to it @ my house agree. Just something about the concept seems to get old after the 3rd song. I would have to recomend you pass on this if your considering picking it up. Until I read that other guys review on this, i hadnt heard one person say they halfway enjoyed listening to this CD."
1,have not yet received so no comment,we have not yet received this item so therefore i am not willing to make comment on the product we were sent a cd of the sounds of india and returned it the next day and are still waiting for nighthawkes to arrive !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Amazing!,You will not be disapointed in this one. The blades are top notch and the saw feels great. My son has this thing about jig saws and I was going to buy a cheap model for him but after receiving this one I let him have a chance on it. I am sure that this will give me many years of service and as soon as I get a table saw; We are planning a few bird houses. I'm still figuring things out on this saw but I have a friend that is in Upholstery and working out of my garage. We have been using this to cut the pannels for custom love seats and chairs. I was using my old jig saw and it took forever; Now that I have the Bosch; I zip through the plywood with no problems. Sometimes you get what you pay for and in this case I got top notch preformance.Thanks to the guy that gave a review on how to put the blades in. I printed it out and things went very smooth the first time around!
4,"Great jig saw, but weak blower performance",Had bought a new DeWalt DW321K prior to this saw...it stopped cutting straight on it's first job!I then read the reviews (should of done my homework) and subsequently took the DeWalt back and traded it for the Bosch.This is a great jig saw! Beautifully built and great cutting performance.My only 'complaint' is the very weak blower at lows speeds.
5,Buy the BOSCH,"This is a really nice jig saw. When I helped my father with some scroll work, he was using an old Craftsman, and while that saw still runs, I cant say much else for it. The BOSCH has so little vibration, the blade changes are so easy, line of sight is very good and the variety of blades available is incredible. I also own the BOSCH barrel grip jig saw and I actually preferred the top handle model for scroll work and the barrel grip for cross cutting ( just because it is esier to push and maintain a square cut ) , which surprises me still because I bought the barrel grip for the other stuff. Nontheless, I own them both and every time others have used my jig saws, they buy them too. These saws really are that much better. BOSCH invented the jig saw and they still lead the way. I'm still not sure how much help the anti splintering tabs are though."
3,It's just OK,"I expected more from this tool and I was disappointed. Yes, compared to the discount brands it is good. But that is not a good comparison. Could be smoother, more powerful, with less vibration and more control. Could also be a little sturdier."
3,Sold Out,"bought my first bosch jigsaw in 2002, still in perfect running order. Could not pass up the good deal found online, however dissapointed my newly purchased saw was made in china. Seems everything these days is made there."
5,The best!,Very very smooth. I have had mine for over two years now and am very happy with it. Blade changes are fairly easy. It feels right in my hands and is well-balanced.
1,Don't buy this hunk of trash!,I owned this piece of junk for about 2 years and only used it for light jobs maybe 5-10 times a year at most. The black knob on the handle that tightens the blade is a joke because it pops off all the time and is poorly designed. Recently the trigger only intermittently worked and the variable speed feature stopped working which made cutting metal a nightmare. I've been a long time user of Bosch tools and I expected much more from them. To be fair I've never had a problem with any of my other Bosch tools. Maybe I should have paid for the higher end model. Quite disappointing given how little I used this Jigsaw. Finally got so fed up I tossed this hunk of junk in the dumpster.
2,Won't stand the test of time,"I've had this jigsaw about a year now. Perhaps went through 20 blade changes. One would expect a thousand more before this tool goes to lala land, but that's not the case. The tool is now rendered useless because the mechanism for blade changes has gone caput. I am past warranty as far as bringing it back for replacement or refund. The other choice is repair which isn't worth the hassle from my perspective. In my opinion this tool will not stand the test of time. This is a twenty dollar tool if the blade mechanism is flawed. {{I suspect it is}}.I don't want to disparage anyone from buying Bosch, just this particular model. The tool wants to do business - but for cripes sakes - It's gotta hold a blade to work. I am not a happy camper."
3,Strong Performer / Flawed Design?,Like many other reviewers I had to have non-warrentied repair to the saw for the blade change mechanism. Repair was so expensive for the PLASTIC gears that I just sold it for parts. I DO love Bosch products and am moving up to Newer Model that had better blade chaning mechanism.
3,Never straight!,"One major frustration I have on this Bosch jigsaw is that the blade doesn't attach perfectly straight (90 degrees). You have to try keeping the blade straight with one hand while you try locking the blade with another (by turning the knob on the top of the jigsaw). A very tricky operation. The problem is evident when I use the anti-splintering insert. The tilted blade rubs/cuts into the plastic insert, causing terrible friction (noise!), as well as damaging/ruining the fragile plastic plate."
2,Great for freehand..,"This saw is very solid, with a nice feel, and a smooth cut. It functions very well freehand, but dont even think about using it with a straight edge guide! There is no way to align the blade with the axis of the body. I thought I had bought a defective saw and was going to exchange it, but found a review on woodnet.net that says its a basic fault. If Bosch ever fixes this I'll buy it with no hesitation."
5,Some of the best anti-poetry out there,"Cook doesn't follow the ""rules,"" and that's what makes him great. His poems are easy to understand and follow, and I think that drives so called poets nuts--you know the poets that think a poem has to be a mystery or hold some deep truth, hidden from the majority of the world. Cook's poems don't toe that line, and they're better for it. That doesn't mean they're light pieces of fluff meant only to get a laugh. There are some poems that have deep emotional content, and once examined, they are as profound as anything by James Wright or Forrest Gander. You just don't have to look as hard."
2,"maybe spoken, but not read","These are short cute spoken word pieces.This is not poetry. Don't yell at me, I don'tmake the rules here, I only follow them.Matt Cook is brash with very little depth.He wants to create his own perspective, butJames Joyce never did speak about boxers,and poems should not always end with a punch line."
3,David and Goliath...,It is difficult to imagine two more contrasting works by a single composeron the same disc. Yuri Temirkanov and the Leningrad Philharmonic give their authoratative all in these live performances from 1989 and 1990.The performance of the miniature Sym. #1 is played with wit and panache but the close upmic recording suffers at times from shrillness. A little more weight on the strings would have helped. On the 5th Sym.(mammoth in size compared to the 1st.) the acoustics are not much better as the big moments don't come off powerful enough.Congestion is especially noticed in the finale with a lack of detail. For perhaps better sound recordings seek out Temirkanov's recent recordings from St. Petersburg. This disc is best for die hard collectors only!
4,Wonderful Romance Novel,"Great romantic novel. It has it all action , comedy , and most of all romance."
1,Used CD barely played,"Luckily, my computer fixed all of the errors from the scratches. This CD doesn't even play properly in a regular CD player."
3,"Not a bad set of remixes, but it could have been better","Addendum is a remix collection based on songs found on Assemblage 23's feature album, Failure. There are also a few new songs, and some older unreleased material. There are a few remixes that catch my attention on Addendum, but most just lack the flavor of the original tracks found on Failure for one reason or another. The new tracks, Let Me Be your Armor, Breath Of Ghosts, and Away are excellect however. Perhaps the reason the remixes did not appeal to me is because they tend to have a more abstract sound than the fast paced originals. I believe if you are a devoted Assemblage 23 fan, it couldn't hurt to try Addendum...just don't expect the remixes to match the quality found on Failure. If you are not yet familiar with Assemblage 23, I suggest you buy Failure or Contempt instead."
2,"Pretty good, but not their best (I give it three stars, not two)","I bought this CD for one song, ""let me be your armor"". I love that song! The rest of the CD is ok, it was fun to hear remixes of ""naked"" and ""disappoint"", but the originals are much better. If you are new to Assemblage 23 I recommend that you buy the Storm album instead."
3,SO SO,Well i thought that it would be spectacular but it was ok i like it but its not the first thing i wanna listen to but i do like it.
5,"EXCELLENT MESSAGE BOOK, I used this professionally with ZERO problems!",This carbonless duplicate message book is terrific for any business or even keeping around the main landline phone in your house. Check out the picture I posted on the main product page for a higher resolution image of what is on the actual message page.Here are some quick comments.Pages tear fairly easily along the perforated lines (sometimes if you're in a hurry you'll have some paper tears but not too oftenEasily transfers to the yellow page behind without having to press down too hard and by having this extra copy you'll never have to worry about what happened to that message you gave to someone and now they don't know where they left it!One book will last quite a while! (400 sets!)I found all the check boxes and writing room on the front more than enough to use for any type of message I EVER tookAt this price the book easily pays for itself in the trouble it savesOverall 5 stars and highly recommended!
3,telephone message book,I didn't realize that every other page is carbon so the book is half the size. Otherwise it is fine.
5,"MAN, WHAT A CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!","I don't know anything else to say, but that Ramon Orlando y La Orquesta Internacional are loaded with ""MEGA HITS"". All of the songs are really great!!! And if you like a lot of ""love merengues"" Ramon Orlando is a genious at that. This is a really good album and you'll enjoy repeating the songs over and over again.......PapyDavid #1 (el punal)"
1,Steering linkage sucks!,"Look cool, but the hiem joints don't have enough material to hold on to after the steering is adjusted. They strip out as soon as you hit the first pot hole. I had to use stock hiems to get them to work and when I did that the cross tubes started to bend. I have never bought anything from this manufacture that actualy works. If your looking to just put your modle on the shelf, then by all means, but if your trying to up grade, you should look around a little more."
2,"bold card play: best strategies for carribean stud, let it r","I am normally very impressed by the gaming books Frank Scoblete has written. However, I was very disappointed in this particular book because it had very liitle substantive, practical advice you come to expect from his books. In addition, there is a glaring mistake in the Three Card Poker section where he discusses the payout schedule (odds) for ""Ante"" and ""Pair Plus"" bets. Specifically, the author list tables of payout schedules that do not correspond to the writtten text (shame on the author as well as the editors!). This made for a very confusing and frustrating read and tempted me to go back to the bookstore for a refund."
1,Way over-priced!!!!,"Although, I highly recommend Arnica as a very wonderful remedy, I do not recommend this brand as it is not necessary to spend 30.00 for 12 capsules. Do a search on Amazon and you will see what I mean. The majority of homeopathic remedies are extremely reasonably priced. If not, then you know your are getting ripped off."
4,"Excellent animal cartoons for children, although some adult interpretation may be needed","All children have the twin love of cartoons and animals and in this book they get both. The cartoons depict animals in funny situations related to the characteristics and environment of the animals. My favorite was on page fourteen, where two goats are chewing on garbage. One is saying to the other, ""Eaten any good books lately?"" This line is also used in the episode ""Deja Q"" of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation."" These are some of the best cartoons about animals for children that have ever been inked, although some adult interpretation may be needed for a few of them. For example, on page 18 there is the buffalo parent telling the calf, ""Did I just hear a discouraging word?"" in an obvious reference to the classic cowboy song, ""Home on the Range."""
1,CESSNA MODEL 170,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE BALSA WOOD WHICH WAS A VERY LOW GRADE, SOFT AND HARD TO CUT. SECOND THE DESIGN WAS VERY POOR, BODY PARTS THAT WAS IN TWO SECTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN ONE PIECE WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE IT MUCH STRONGER, THE PARTS WHERE CUT IN A VERY GOOD SECTIONS."
3,5/e is not much better than 4/e,"The 5/e is much better organised, though, there are still lots of typos.Some of the important formulas that can be found in 2/e vanish in 5/e.Most importantly, certain example results cannot be duplicated by using the data provided in the author's web site.Fumio Hayashi's ""Econometrics"" is still the best in terms of learning.Paul Arthur Ruud's ""An introduction to classical econometric theory"" provides many good exercises, but no empirical examples at all.John Johnston's ""Econometric methods"" is highly readable but not enough to get to the literature.For Greene's 5/e, it is a good reference but not a good textbook."
3,heavy book with massive obscure notations,"This intermediate book has a broad coverage of modern econometric topics. The author is also the developer of the Limdep software and certainly has pretty good understanding this subject.Although his effort of bringing some theoretical points into the book should be encouraged, many concepts would be better understood if he hadn't used his vague notations. In addition, It would be more appropriate to introduce the general ideas of MLE, GMM, and GLS in the first chapter so the following chapters would be easy to follow.One strength is that this book covered a lot of time series analysis. This may serve well since this book is likely used in applied instead of theoretical econometric students.Nevertheless, I think it may worthwhile to take this book."
2,just so-so,"Don't buy this book unless you are 'advanced reader' who can detect typos and figure out what Mr Greene is trying to say. If you really want to know the advanced econometrics without getting lost in meaningless technique details, read Hayashi's book. That book is much more readable."
1,this book stinks,"i bought this book as a grad student a couple of years ago. as the title of this review suggests, this book stinks. it's poorly organized, and the proof and derivations (when included) are difficult to follow not because the math is hard but because greene's not a good mathematical writer. if you have to learn econometrics, go with hayashi and hamilton; they're way better."
1,Virtually incomprehensible,"This book is poorly organized, badly written, and so difficult as to be virtually incomprehensible to all but the most advanced mathematics students. Even the infrequent examples skip so many steps that they are hard to follow. Do not torture yourself with this book unless it is absolutely required - and unless first you have vigorously but unsuccessfully lobbied against its use. Pair this textbook with a sub-par instructor and you will be living a nightmare. Surely there is a more user- friendly option available!"
2,No unified framework,"This is an okay book, but certainly not all too clear. The authors do not distinguish between the important and the not so important topics. The order of the chapters is not well chosen and summaries of the most important results are missing. This book certainly gives a lot of information, but a unified framework is missing and hence makes this a rather difficult book to learn econometrics from."
3,blah...,"Having read many, many books on Egyptian history, I was looking forward to this one. I read ""Child of The Morning"" written from the point of Queen Hatshepsut that I absolutely loved, and was curious to see what the other side had to say. Unfortunately, I was under whelmed. Not that ""Warrior Pharaoh"" is bad, on the contrary, it is very informative and carefully researched. Well, maybe a bit too carefully... I just couldn't shake the feeling that I was reading a detailed textbook on Egypt rather than a work of fiction. The fact that it is written as a diary did not help. The narrator sounds like a tour guide rather than a pharaoh. As a result, I had no emotional connection with the characters. No vested interest in the outcome of the story and remained a mere impassive observer throughout. And if I had to choose sides, I'd go with Hatshepsut..."
3,H&R vs GTA -can't help comparing,"Let me start off by saying, I love the Simpsons and I love this style game. I have to say, though, that playing it was a bit frustrated...I couldn't help comparing it to GTA3(Grand Theft Auto 3). In GTA3, you are your own man and can do pretty much what you want. The Simpsons characters, however, were held too much to a structured game play. It would have been neat if parallel mission strings existed in which you could define Springfeilds future in some way.For those who can't stomach grand theft auto, this game is for you. I assume you don't know what your missing.If you have played grand theft auto, you may be left disappointed."
4,Cool game,Cool game for the gamecube. A must have if you're a fan of the Simpsons and the Gamecube. Decent price as well.
5,Worst Simpsons Game Ever!,"Well, that's what Comic Book Guy would say about the game, anyway- and he would be wrong. This game is easy to pick up and have fun with, but has tons to do, is difficult to master the controls, and has many unlockable items. In other words, it has everything a new gamer or a hardcore gamer could want. For any Simpsons fan, this is a must have. Thanks to the creators of this game for putting out such a solid title on Gamecube- we need more of these!"
4,GTA! Not!,"This is a sweet game! If you like Grand Theft Auto, but not all the blood and the killing, this is the game for you! It's completely loyal to the show, and the cars are awesome! (Absolutely EVERY car has appeared on the show... As far as I know, anyway). But you may remember many of the famous gags and landmarks.(Ex. Quik-E-Mart, Larry the Looter)"
5,AN AMAZING GAME!!!!!!,"WOW! I am a 34 year old male and this game had me completely hooked. What an incredible job the developing team has done. I have never played such an interesting, captivating and well themed game in my life. If this is the future of gaming, sign me up. Great, fantasic, superb, amazing job. Thanks for the fun!!!!"
3,Is the language really necessary?,"It's bad enough that my son talked me into buying a game that includes running over people, police chases, and car theft - these things he understands are make-believe - but is the bad language really necessary? The first time he played it, after five minutes, I was tired of hearing Homer incessantly swearing, cursing, and namecalling. While my son isn't going to run people over with a car, he will pick up phrases and words. Fortunately, the game has the option of turning off the voices."
4,Great,"This game is alot of fun, u get to be the whole Simpson family and be able to interact with all the other famous springfielders in fun sometimes almost impossible missions. Loved this game even before I started watching the Simpsons and its so much fun picking up on the episode trivia in the game!"
3,Simpson hit and run,"Bought for our grandson. He said it was fun but not a much as he had expected., But he does play it every once in a while."
3,Funney and fun game,I bought this game for my brother in 2006. Its a funney game full of simpsons humer. the good part about this game is that it uses real evets from the show to play out the story. In the game you have to drive aroud in at least 25 different cars (all from the show) and compleat events like help chef wigom collect doenets or find all of Dr nicks lab monkeysThe down side of the game is there are way to maney game errors like invisable walls and geting lost in nothingness but you probably won`trun into these things unless you use cheats.The other downside is there are only 7 levels and 3 worlds. But the levels are really long and the world are really big.I give this game 7 out of 10
5,Wonderful GTA-Style Adaption to the Simpsons Universe,"This game provides a great open world, Grand Theft Auto-type experience existing in The Simpsons universe. You can play as several characters, including Homer, Bart, Marge, Lisa, and Apu. The game has many familiar Springfield residents and references for the casual fan, but also a surprising amount of semi-obscure references for the true fans out there.I found it to be a rewarding experience for a true Simpsons fan."
3,"A fun, quite annoying game.","A Simpsons fan will enjoy this game for a few days. The game takes place in a very realistic 3-d world of Springfield. You can drive around town and explore at your own pace. But, then there's an actual game with missions that takes place. Bart gets abducted by space aliens, and the family works hard tracking him down. You take turns as Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge and Apu repeating virtually the same missions over and over again. The game is fairly hard, and quite frustrating. Going to all the different places in Springfield is very fun, but the mission's are a pain in the neck. Especially when you come real close, and miss, and have to do the whole thing over again. The game's cheap now, so it's worth a pick up. But, play just to drive around and explore the town. The vehicles are fun and fast, and if you get bored, actually play the game."
3,"not bad, and it doesn't suck or blow","it is hugethe diolog is okgraphics are goodsound, obiosly is good, and there is plenty of songsinteraction, isn't that great, but the levels are huge so it really doesn't manorgameplay, is fun and fasthonestly i really should have gotton true crime in the streets of L.A.i used to be a simpsons fan so it was nice to see a simpsons game that didn't suck or blow"
2,EEEEEWWWWW!!!!!!!,this is NOT what i 'spected from da simpsons.i think U waste ur time with 'dis gayme. try a difernt game or go back to pacman! Haaaaa!
3,miss read,"i bought this thinking it would be like the one i played as a child, but it's not and it wasn't compatible on my computer."
1,Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?,"loved this game as a kid but, cant even play this will not work at all on windows 7, which realy sucked, i donated it to my local elementry school. it does work ok on the older comps."
1,Wrong edition,"As a student in college, having the edition requested by the professor is important to success in that class. Needless to say, after waiting for forever to have the book delivered, I was severely disappointed to find that they sent me the wrong edition of the book when the receipt that came with it made it clear that I had asked for a different edition. I made over 12 orders for textbooks at the same time, and this was the only order that 1) came a week later than everything else and 2) sent me the completely wrong edition."
2,Okay Game.,"My favorite genre of games are survival horror. This game isn't as good as Silent Hill three. Plus it won't sell good because many parents won't let their kids buy this game. The Suffering is also scary, but not like Silent Hill 3. The graphics aren't great and it's too gory. Their is a lot of pointless gore. They tried to make it like a Grand Theft Auto with more Gore. If you want a better game check out Fatal Frame 2 or Silent Hill 3. These are better games."
4,Much more difficult than I remember it being.,"When I first bought this game many years ago, I was amazed at how difficult yet fun it was. I ended up selling it because it froze on me many times. When I saw that there was a sequel I decided to buy it again and try to see how it ended. I am looking forward to completeing this game for the first time."
3,Right...,"First of all, i live and breathe Silent hill. And the main thing I've been seeing in these reviews are people knocking SH. Stop it!Secondly, this game is not all that. And the flaws go well beyond comparing to RE or SH, it goes to the controls. Which suck. To turn around to face a creature behind you takes far too long for a vid game of this Genre, even when you turn the sensitivity to the max level.Now, let's talk about the length. Now SH2&3 also were very short games. But they provided memorable characters with real emotions and disturbing twists. This game offers you characters which talk about how they wish there were in the hood other than this prision and curse farrrrrr too much for a survival (or action) horror game.Last is the good. Which is the atmosphere. This game lives and breathes it. And of course the action, which is stylish, but yet sadly enough I never found myself wanting for anything more than the duel revolvers.So, rent it for a weekend and you'll be more than pleased"
3,Title Says It All!,"I must agree with the other reviews that while this book is adequate for survival, it is no more than that.It has no notes on Hungarian grammar (which is VERY different from English) and only a minimal dictionary and hints on pronounciation.Ditto the phrases themselves - they do cover the essentials, but nothing more than that. That said, at least they are all correct, free of mistakes!Still, if you just go for a short trip to Budapest, you'll probably find this book adequate.But if you want something better, I recommend Lonely Planet's Hungarian phrasebook, published in March 2005.But do bring a phrasebook if you want to explore Hungary in any depth - apart from those working in the tourism industry, few Hungarians speak English, especially out in the rural areas."
3,You shouldn't have to make much effort speaking Hungarian...,"...So we won't make much effort writing a book. This guide to the Hungarian language begins with an explanation that locals will ""feel gratified"" that you're making an attempt at Hungarian and will ""probably go out of their way to understand you."" The editors' view is that Hungarian is very difficult to pronounce, so why bother with much of a pronunciation guide, so ""just wing it."" Hmm, well. To be fair, they do offer phonetic transliterations beneath each phrase that approximate the proper pronciation while still being pronounceable by English speakers. Still, since they offer three (whoo! three!) pronunciation hints in the pronunciation guide, they might have made a point of also mentioning something pretty major such as ""J' apparently is pronounced as a ""Y"". However, they let you figure that out as you go along. Again, to be fair, the book is very economical and should be sufficient for a short trip."
3,Just enough hungarian,"It is very practical, for tourists and for everyone, who just wants to be able to speak a few words, or just wants to please some Hungarian friends. You can find pretty much everything you need to say, without learning the extremely complex and difficult Hungarian grammar. It's basically a dictionary with useful sentences.The only weakness is, that the pronounciation is sometimes somewhat off, at least when pronounced by American."
4,Grat help!,I had a business trip to Hungary in June 2005. I was there for 2 weeks and Just Enough Hungarian was a huge help. I used it in conjunction with another guide and was able to have a great and successful trip.
2,Collects dust....,"This book is simply an overview of different systems, with no detailed information on the design and setup of actual installation. While it may be a good primer for someone who knows nothing about nitrous or forced induction, if your serious about learning how the systems work there are many better books on the market. Out of all the books I own this is one of the few I would gladly get rid of- It hasnt been opened in years.-Jack"
1,minuse zero,I ordered a book and special print on the cover of the book but when I received my book it was another edition with another cover picutre on the cover of the book. I don't like to work with this suplier again because I feel that I've been cheated.
2,Chevy lovers beware!!,"This could be the answer to Chevy lovers. Especially if you are interested in Turbo system. But, sorry no dice. This book will come without the front cover it shows. To start off things, It will come with a Ford Mustang. Inside the information is not bad, but when you are going to look for specific information about Chevy engines it will give you Ford, Honda, Mazda (piston engine). It is a little deseving. If you are a Ford lover this book is for you. In my case, I can always resell it."
5,what you need,"this book has all you need to know about turbochargers, superchargers, and nos. I also suggest giant spoiler, loud exhaust, and fast driving. this has all you need to give your car the extra little horsepower you need to push minivans into the road to be run over, or to get a few more mpg. good buy"
4,looks just like it,"works well. big mouth, easy to refill, a little challenging to clean with Baking Soda but serves my water! Reccomend it."
4,Expensive,"Expensive, but very nice and worth it to me. Bring the price down some, and then it rates 5 stars!"
1,bluewave home 3 gallon water jug,Very disappointed!! I thought this jug was safe for water storage but apparently it's one of the worst plastics to hold water due to leaching. This was advertised as safe & stated that it was BPA free which it clearly isn't.
2,The cap leaks if the bottle is horizontal on a rack.,"If you are going to store the water bottles horizontally on a rack, then this is not the bottle for you."
1,"Not sturdy, not water tight","I bought several of these 3-gallon bottles less than a year ago. I was pleased to find a BPA bottle and while $20 seemed high, I didn't mind when I thought that I was getting a high-quality long lasting item. I was hoping to store the bottles on their sides, but that didn't work because the caps weren't water tight no matter how hard I screwed them on. We're pretty gentle on the bottles so I haven't had a chance to test their stength, but this week, my grocery cart was bumped and a filled bottle rolled out of the space under the cart. It only dropped a few inches, and not at high speed, but the bottle shattered spilling water all over the grocery store. I contacted Blue wave and they told me to work with amazon, but amazon's return policy isn't helpful either. Disappointed.Update: a few weeks later, another bottle broke when it tipped over. Reducing my rating to 1 star. Total garbage! Do not buy these bottles!"
4,Good,"Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it took a while for the ""plastic"" taste to go away from the bottle. Once it did, it was fine."
1,Did not last long,I bought four of these 3 gallon water bottles 3 months ago and they worked fine during that time. It is nice having a screw on cap versus a snap on cap; also good is the handle feels sturdy. Unfortunately one of the bottles started leaking from the bottom. It wasn't dropped or hit so just be careful that the plastic may not be very durable.
1,Bottle shattered on the first day!,"This bottle shattered on the first day of use. The filled bottle shattered right in front of us when my husband placed it on the floor in the garage and water was all over the place. Well, the good thing was it shattered in the garage and not inside the house...on my hardwood floor. I was so disappointed with its quality!!!!! The wall of the bottle is very thin. If you decide to give it a try, make sure you handle it as an egg!"
2,Get something sturdier,"The bottle was great until it got knocked on the side and cracked - not a small crack. I was going to order another since it was my fault that it was damaged but realized there were several reviews about it cracking at the seams and not being very sturdy. I think I'll just try something else. From reviews, it also seems like a waste of time to contact the company since their customer service is lacking - another big turn off for me."
2,High Voltage,"I watched this movie to see a very young Carole Lombard act. She did a great job. Her acting, however, was not enough to make this film worth watching. I would skip it unless you are a true Lombard fan!"
3,Too obscure for me.,A lot of trivia-type goofy questions. Love the whole collection of bathroom readers but the puzzle books.... not so much.
1,Mastey Frehair,"Worst product ever! I ordered this online because Ulta3 no longer carried it, the packaging was different but was still Mastey Frehair ... they must have changed the formula! It used to be light and great anti-static ... but no longer, its heavy and yuck!The seller delivered as promised, but the product isn't worth a hoot."
3,The Normans,On the whole this was a good documentary. Very good footage of historic places and for the most part accurate. What was disappointing was the total inaccuracy of the crusades and the take over of the middle east and north africa by Islam. This was all done in the typical British fashion of being politically correct to the point of rewriting history to soothe the muslims. Fact of the matter is that the muslims took over the middle east by force with great bloodshed and the crusades was not a racial war. It was a religious war trying to regain what Judaism and Christianity lost by force to the muslims.
1,Junk,"This case has a great appearance and I really liked the idea that my PDA would be protected in a non-crushable case! However, the clips that hold the PDA are flimsy and never actually held on. So, if I dropped the case--the cover would open and my PDA went flying. That defeated the entire purpose of getting this kind of case!"
3,It works,"I had this surrounding my PDA for about 3 months. Didn't really get tested this morning when I left it on the trunk of my car (wow am I smart!) and drove away. About an hour and a half later I got a call from a guy who found the PDA in the street. The case is destroyed and the PDA did sustain some damage (scratches and dings in the plastic) but it still works fine. I was probably moving about 20 mph when it flew off. So, for the first impact, it did it's job.On the down side the case doesn't close very securely and the pieces that hold the PDA in place don't do a great job. Next time around I'm going to install my own security (Velcro or doublesided tape) because, when using the case with an SJ30 you never need to remove it to change out rechargable batteries."
2,iConcepts Alum Hard Case for Sony,"The case fits the PDA well, but the method of securing the PDA into the case was poorly ""engineered"". The case would work better with (Velcro) loop and hook strips to secure the PDA."
1,Worthless! Poorly designed.,"I guess I should have known this product was worthless when I saw the pricing disparity between it and the well-known Rhino Skin case (which I can't review because I've never owned one). The Sony won't stay in place in the case and it's hard to open. Also, very difficult to get to the stylus. I purchased this because on my Sony Peg S-320, the cover constantly came off. Now the factory flip cover locks on and seems more secure. I still would prefer a hard case because I am always concerned about it getting scratched in my bookbag. Bottom line, under no certain circumstances should you purchase this item."
3,Better than the RhinoSkin,"I purchased this because it looked more secure than the RhinoSkin I had purchased. This case has a much larger securing tab on the outside of the case so it does not open as easy as the RhinoSkin does. With any slight bumps or even just putting it in my pocket the tabs would be rendered useless and the case would flip open with just holding it upside down. This securing tab does not bend like that.I will admit that the tabs holding the PDA in place are much worse than the RhinoSkin's, but that is easily fixed with velcro as stated in another review. I was also able to secure it pretty well with the cheap little tabs and after closing the case pushing resecuring it. We will see how long that lasts.If you want your Clie held in the case when it is open, get the RhinoSkin, but if you want the case to remain closed with the Clie inside get this one. Neither is awesome, but this is better for my needs."
2,Contradictory!,"My girlfriend and I got this book after she recently became pregnant. We're going through the food section and getting ready for our first trip to the grocery store for pregnancy food. And we're running into all these contradictory statements... for instance, one page says swordfish is a high risk fish for mercury and it should be avoided, and two pages later there's a box that includes swordfish as being a good thing to get. The book seems to contradict itself about other fish, and cheeses and lordy knows what else. It seems like a thorough book but this isn't a good start!"
5,Phillip Marlow meets Herman Goering,"It's been awhile since I've read a mystery series that has grabbed me with the intensity of Phillip Kerr's Berlin trilogy. Right from the start, his writing reminds you of Raymond Chandler, though more vivid and descriptive. But Phillip Marlowe never had to worry about ending up in a concentration camp and that threat gives the first two novels in this series even more of an edge. Kerr creates a dead on accurate feel for what it was like to live in Nazi Germany before the outbreak of the war. Like all good historical fiction, famous names grace the pages as minor characters, including Goering and Renhard Heydrich. Their appearances give the books weight, but Kerr is careful not to overdo it. Fans of Caleb Carr's superb novel ""The Alienist"" in particular should love this series as well as anyone with an interest in Nazi Germany."
3,Mixed Results,"This trilogy is intriguing because I have several complaints about Kerr's style, yet I really did enjoy these books. First the complaints: 1) Way too many cliches. It's as if Kerr is trying to write a parody of thirties detective stories, except it isn't supposed to be funny. He's trying too hard to get the reader to see Bernie as a ""seen too much"", jaded character. 2) Kerr's description of Bernies sexual adventures is overdone and quite frankly the prose is laughable. It's like he took it straight from ""Penthouse Forum"".On the other hand, I thought the storytelling was very good, and the plot lines were solid. And Kerr, to his credit, is capable of coming up with phrases that stick with you instantly.An enjoyable and worthwhile read, but Alan Furst is a much better example of the genre."
4,"Thanks, Reinhard!","Never thought I'd find myself reading a PI tale where I was rooting for Reinhard Heydrich to come to the hero's rescue! And he does! These three tales are full of Nazi- and post-Nazi era Berlin atmosphere and detail. I couldn't stop reading for that alone. Bernie Gunther, the hero, is a PI-Gestapo cop-PI who doesn't really like the Nazis but does a lot of work with and for them, simply because he needs to survive. The plots are a little too conveniently convoluted for my taste, and I find the main character's hard-boiled wisecracks too imitative of Philip Marlowe to be believable. So Bernie is a long way down my list of favorite PI's, but his time and place rate much higher. The author can occasionally turn a nice phrase, but just as often can write something clangingly bad. But recommended for its research, background and semi-originality."
4,A Phillip Marlowe for Berlin,"One of Chandler's strengths was his portrayal of the diverse suburbs and layers of society that made up 1930's LA. Phillip Kerr gives us a similar feel for Berlin in the 1930's. I can't vouch for the historical accuracy, but it seems well-researched. The plots are not wholly convincing. March Violets in particular has an endpiece that seems to have been grafted on to the main plot. The denoumement occurs in a concentration camp, which gives Kerr the chance for a portrayal of conditons in the camp but doesn't add greatly to the storyline. Kerr also has an irritating tendency to overuse metaphors, to the point where he sometimes seems to be lampooning the harboiled gumshoe genre. But on the whole, all three novels are good reading, with interesting and well-drawn characters."
2,Soft boiled,This is bad Chandler.This is bad Chandler with a boring gazetteer of Berlin thrown in.This is Chandler with a boring gazetteer of Berlin thrown in and a few German brand names that we haven't heard of to make it feel like there's a veneer of period immersion.It's like visiting a National Trust property in England with the idea that you're somehow in touch with the past.Even Chandler never wrote anything as bad as this even when he was having a really bad day. And Chandler isn't a very good writer.Can I have my money back please?
3,Berlin Noir,I know this is supposed to be a classic. I read about it in the Wall St. Journal. There are three novellas in this book. One thing I didn't like about this edition was the print was so small. I'm not a youngster.
2,Nasty too,"I enjoyed the earthy, impudent and skeptical tone of the narrator-detective, and found the first novel great at conjuring up the atmosphere of Berlin in the early Nazi years, but was disturbed by the vicious homophobia in the second novel, THE PALE CRIMINAL, which plays in part in the gay subculture. While the hero objects to Nazi anti-semitic policies and stresses the need for moral backbone, he apparently fully ENDORSES --without irony-- the Nazis' persecution of homosexuals. The novel is filled with invective against gays, and the protagonist not only endorses sending homosexuals to concentration camps, but enjoys (!) shooting them ""between the eyes"" himself. I'm frankly surprised that of all the people writing here, nobody has even noticed these hateful diatribes."
4,Really enjoy them but cannot quite justify that fifth star,"The first of the trilogy was slow going, and I was not certain that I would warm to this series, but by halfway through the second book, I was hooked. Agree with one review that questions the hard-boiled similes and metaphors - seem a bit overcooked - but not speaking German, I have no real sense of contemporary German slang in the 1930s and 1940s. As much a period piece as crime novel, the books do address the moment in history and give one pause to think about he lives of everyday Germans as the Nazis came to power and then lost the war. The third novel is probably the best of the three. The portrait of post-war Germany is sad and frightening - my boss served in the occupation forces in Germany after WWII and his stories confirm the Germany portrayed in the book.Will definitely keep on with Bernie. Well worth the money and the time."
5,First rate!,Philip Kerr is a real find. His characters and setting come to life in all their sleazy splendor. Enjoy!
4,Synchronicity,"In the second of these novels Jung's concept of synchronicity is mentioned, and it is an apt explanation for the strings of coincidences that drive the plots of these novels, and ultimately come together in a more or less coherent whole, as is typical of this genre. There were some critical plot elements that were obviously wrong, no doubt due to the author's oversight: in particular in March Violets the photos of Six's daughter that Bernie had already seen. Nevertheless, these novels are vivid and gripping."
2,A Slow Day in Berlin,"Unfotunately even though I am a fan of this books character, I was not a fan of this book. Slow, ponderous and not very compelling."
5,A wonderful intriguing set of mysteries. A great value,"I think Phillip Kerr is an outstanding mystery writer. The three books in this collection take place during Germany's disastrous time of Nazism. He manages to insert some sort of sanity and humor to a time when nothing made sense. He does not make excuses for what happened to Bernie Gunther, the detective of this series, during the Nazi period. Bernie is an endearing character. I recommend this trilogy highly"
4,With little mistakes,"Kerr's trilogy is in the best Chandler style. He captures the feeling and atmosphere of the Third Reich. While it is a fast and good plot, Kerr fails in the geographic accuracy. ""Clayallee"" i.e. did not exist in the 30s as it was named after General Lucius Clay, organizer of the Berlin airlift.Kerr's direct translations of German pro-verbs or colloquial language is a bit annoying, but if one can overlook these, his work is very enjoyable."
3,Berlin Noir,"I like books about Germany during this time as I find it interesting as well as horrifying. Mostly I read auto-biographies and biographies. I like mysteries as well so I thought I might like this book. Unfortunately, I ordered two. I agree there are way too many cliches. Plus, it is a little too graphic and the language and content is too blatant for my taste. I prefer a little lower key type of thing like Mr.Downing's novels.It was a horrible dark period in history but the characters in these books, even the main character, to me have very few redeeming features. I like it that the detective is against the regime but I wish he was also a little more moral. Sorry, that sounds silly, but I guess it is just a matter of taste."
5,Vocode Your Love,"Hands down one of the best albums that I have listened to in a very long time... The music, the composition, and the harmony... It is so good... You can so just chill and get a good vibe to it... Play it for your girlfriend... Show your silly and sensitive side at the same time...-You know-"
4,Data 80 - Data 80,"Bright and glossy 80s-style techno, courtesy of Mr. Hakan Lidbo. But instead of much of the 'electroclash' coming out these days, DATA 80 goes for the highly polished sheen of pop (""Love Will Always Find You,"" for instance), rather than gloomy new wave. Plenty of vocoder, for those who like that sort of stuff. Lidbo messes with the system, however, by throwing in slightly glitchy touches that keep the listener on his toes. While the majority of the tracks are upbeat, ""The Boy Who Grew Up to Be A Boy (Extended Mix)"" goes a slower route, an electronic ballad with vocoder, while the non-extended version is all glitchy electro. The real gem of the bunch, however, is ""Don't Believe Me,"" the best meta-pop song I've ever heard. It's self-referential and irreverent, which automatically puts it on my spin list. A great album altogether."
3,One Spectacular Moment.....,"This film contains the single attempt of MGM to bring Billy Eckstine to the silver screen, though the plot line stalls and the dialogue is silly, Mr ""B"" delivers a true knockout punch in his scene as a night club singer. His appearance onsreen equals majesty."
2,"Well, they tried","Stuck with a turkey script--a sort of reverse ""On The Town"" with three waves trying unsuccessfully to land a sailor during a brief fun break--MGM brought in Debby Reynolds and Bobby Van to do a frantic dance number, Keenan Wynn to introduce himself (!), an old guy (inevitably called Pops) to add time to the film, the De Marco sisters to sing, and jazz crooner Billy Eckstine. The minute and a half with Eckstine is wonderful, but the rest of the film is embarrassingly bad. The swimming numbers and lousy songs were low budget, the ""training camp"" Wave scenes were ridiculous, the acting...well, let's just say that Barry Sullivan was miscast and Vivian Blaine had already done all that in ""Guys and Dolls."" Oh yes, and you have to see Keefe Brasselle trying to sing! Taken as a satire on Esther Williams movies, this might be enjoyable to a few. Otherwise, it might help to get drunk before hitting ""Play."" Better yet, avoid this stinker. No wonder it didn't make DVD."
4,Great for one shower but not 2+,"I totally love this Bridal Shower memory keeper! Its perfect in almost every way...For you lucky brides that are receiving more than one shower, as I did, it only has enough space for one shower. I wish the binding was 3 ring binding so that I could add more pages to include the other showers I was given. I had to copy the pages myself and added them in a separate scrapbook. But other than that, its the ""almost"" perfect bridal shower memory keeper :)"
4,Saved the day!,"I was in big trouble for time and needed a Bridal shower book fast! This was definitely that. It came in no time and It is great. It's got plenty of room for guests to sign, give advice, list the gifts you recieved, and room for ton of pictures too!! I like also that it has special little things like ""Keepsakes from the shower"" and ""Special Moments"". I pressed flowers in mine from the shower. I also like that it showcases the bride and Bride & Groom in the front."
5,A Fabulous Gift!,"This book is the perfect keepsake for any shower! The illustrations are attractive and heart-warming, and will help you to remember all the loved ones that helped make your this the most special time of your life. A fun project for any bride - a fabulous gift!"
4,A thoughtful story of exploration,"Comparisons to Ursula Le Guin are unavoidable, it seems. After all, here is a quietly paced, thoughtful journey/adventure story about a girl whose life is changed forever when she is exiled from her homeland. ""Kinless"", she moves from place to place, interacting briefly with various people and searching for her identity and for companionship, in a world that is becoming foreign to her. There are frozen landscapes, an identity crisis theme, and tragedies along the way. Despite the comparisons, this is a well written novel. ""Jan/Jana"" is a compelling and sympathetic character, and her experiences are movingly told."
3,The best Ursula Le Guin novel she never wrote,"Maureen McHigh's latest is not by any means a bad book. In fact it is a superb story of troubled adolescence and the uncertain relationship between low-tech and high-tech societies.The problem is that it reads like the kind of book Ursula Le Guin used to write thirty years ago back when she was writing her best feminist science fiction. In fact it reads so much like Le Guin that it doesn't read like McHugh anymore.This wouln't be so bad if McHugh's previous books had been bad, but they happened to be the best things I had read in ages. Come back Maureen!"
2,More of a world-exploration than a plot-driven story,"If you're looking for a book with a plot, keep looking. While the author has created an interesting world, only glimpses of the world are shown, as the main character simply has event after event happen to her. It read like a series of short stories that were written about a character in different points of the character's life, then strung together the day before deadline.There wasn't much of an ending, which isn't a surprise since there wasn't much of a middle either. The whole book is all ""beginning"", without anything being developed. Which is sad, because there were a lot of good ideas mixed up in there."
2,Autobiography of a Zombie,"If it is true that the unexamined life is not worth living, then the heroine of this book has lived a pointless life. Everything happens to our first person narrator and it is all accepted without any sense of emotion or evaluation. Maybe the author intended this, but I felt I was reading the autobiography of a zombie. If the narrator didn't care, why should I? ""Only connect . . ."""
2,Skip It.,"This book doesn't come close to how interesting China Mountain Zhang or Half the Day is Night are.The book is well written, however the story goes nowhere and the ending is totally curt and unsatisfying. I kept waiting for something to exciting to happen, nothing ever did.Don't waste your time on this book - I'm sorry I did. Read CMZ(5*) or HTDIN(4*) instead. Those books were MUCH more interesting and engaging."
5,Very helpful book to weaken negative beliefs about yourself.,"I first read Overcoming Shyness and Social Anxiety in the ""Overcoming"" series and found the writing style, presentation of the model, and steps to change extremely helpful. That book also helped me to identify one of my core issues as low self-esteem which led me to this book. I have read numerous books on CBT and psychology in general but these two books have been the most helpful. They both present an illustration of the model for the issue which simplifies the problem and makes change seem not so overwhelming. Then the systematic change process is clearly explained with plenty of examples. The bottom line is the change process presented in these two books works. I am not completely healed but I see these negative beliefs weaking by degress and my confidence improving. I believe that I have finally found the answers that I have been looking for for a long, long time."
5,"Everybody Should Read This Book. Chances Are, You Have Low Self Esteem",This book explains how to set boundaries and identify bad behaviors that hold you down in life. Everybody talks about having high self esteem or believe they have normal or high self esteem but have never read about it.Buy this book and find out if you really have a normal self esteem or where is that anxiety or depression coming from.
3,great info but does not translate well,"to a kindle. No matter how I turned my kindle, the tables and questions presented could not be read without a magnifying glass. So if you don't mind skipping those parts, it's a good read but I'm not sure I'd want to pay $8.35 again for info I can't read. And no, the info will not get bigger expanding one's fingers over the screen."
5,The BEST Christian step-family book,"My husband and I read several books about remarriage/step-family life and this is the one we have returned to over and over again for it's wisdom and practicality. Mr. Deal's training and experience as a licensed counselor lends additional credibility to the material. This book offers more than just a few memorable guidelines (ie: 7 Steps), it fosters a healthy and productive attitude toward step-family life with sound, biblical foundations. The format is easy to read and includes questions at the end of each chapter to help generate discussion. Highly recommended to anyone entering or in a step-family."
5,a must read,"This is a must read for all engaged couples who have been married before, and/or are bringing children into the new marriage. It is a practical eye-opener that helps the couple prepare with appropriate expectations. All couples hope and assume that their next marriage will be successful, but many times expectations are too high and unrealistic, and this can sabatoge the new marriage. The book is also great for couples already married into a step-family situation, showing them how to set appropriate goals. The book lays it on the line how difficult the challenges are for a step family, but also encourages the reader to look for the strength and blessings God is providing for them daily."
4,Great for Pre-marital Conversations,"I recently got engaged to a man with 3 kids from a previous marriage. I've always had some concerns about how we blend my single life with his family situation and had sought out books about becoming a step-mother while dating. I ordered this book after becoming engaged and we have gone through the first few chapters. We have had great conversations about how our marriage impacts the kids, how to manage different things. The book confirms what many people have told me - it won't be easy, but we can have a successful, rewarding marriage if we communicate and work through things, especially with God at the center of it. While intimidating, this book also helps me see how much the kids can benefit from our strong relationship."
5,What Would I Have Done Without This Book?,"I bought this book during the process of my divorce in hopes of learning the kind of ex-wife I wanted to be in preparation for a future family with a new husband (whether he brought children with him or not). It helped me through that process and now, as I'm beginning a new journey with my new husband, it is helping us to better understand our family and how to interact together with my children as well as their father.Thank you for being so inspired to write this book. It was a God send!"
2,Too Preachy,"I am a recently-minted step parent who needed to work out some issues with my stepdaughters. I started looking for books on the subject and read an excerpt from this book on a blog, so I ordered it. I was not prepared for the overly religious tone of the text. Yes, we do go to church each Sunday. But religion is not the overriding factor in our life, as Deal would want it to be for our family. Therefore, I haven't read any further than the first couple of chapters in the book. This would be a good book otherwise, but Deal needs to tone down the Christian angle a bit."
5,A step-family must read,I have personally led step-family groups using this book as the material and have found it very helpful for many of the issues that step-families face today.
3,Pretty basic stuff,"This book is well-written and is an easy, enjoyable read. However, if you are honoring God in your marriage and respect is already demonstrated in your house and everyone's roles are clear, this book will not help you much. It seems to be more of a wake-up call to those who might have entered a second (or subsequent) marriage based on shallowness. If you are thoughtful and living as God intends and acting as the fully-realized adults in the family, you would already be coming up with the ideas that are in this book, in my opinion."
1,Not worth it,Apparently this is a comic book in the print version but is just a short novel in the Kindle version. The story is weak and unnecessary if you've read the Saga of Seven Suns.
1,Failed Alliances,"This is a comic book. Unfortunately I did not discover this until after I had placed my order, for this product but thought ""Hey it's still SoSS of it's bound to be good right?""Wrong. Or rather, it was OK but nothing more than that. The drawings are good, but the story is nowhere to be found. If this work is designed to draw readers into the series, I fear it has failed. Not only does it offer HUGE spoilers but it fails to bring out the most basic intrigues and plots that make the series great. Words cannot express my extreme dissapointment when I read a $12.00 comic book that offered me nothing that I hadn't alreadr read in the novels.If you like pretty pictures this product is for you.To the rest of the SoSS fans, skip it. And to you who haven't read SoSS, go pick up a copy of Hidden Empire today!"
4,nice companion to the saga,"It has become something of a fad for authors to have graphic novel ""prequels"" released for their popular series. The Dresden Files, Mercy Thompson, The Hallows and Anita Blake all have a graphic novel that takes place before the series begins. This is billed the same, however, it actually includes minor spoilers for the first two books. This is a problem because if you have read the series, there is nothing new here, and if you haven't, some surprises will be lost. That said, this is worthwhile to pick up. The alternate format is a nice contrast to text heavy novels and the artwork is simply stunning - clean, well drawn, and richly detailed. The book is full color throughout, on glossy pages. The plot is limited, but clearly revealed, and leads directly into the series. This is a nice companion to Anderson's rich and sprawling science fiction epic. Highly recommended, but I suggest reading Hidden Empire before beginning Veiled Alliances."
2,Comic Book,"I recently read all seven novels of the Saga of Seven Suns and came across this title thinking it was a prequel to the original stories. I was surprised to receive a comic book! A very quick read, and nothing new learnt about the main story line. Buy it for completeness of the collection, but don't expect an interesting or riveting reading experience. Maybe I missed the fine print on the amazon product description page, but it was not mentioned anywhere that it was a comic book."
4,Great prequel,"Star Wars has given Prequels a bad name, but Veiled Alliances proves that they can be good. This look at the Saga helps explain how things came to be exactly how they are, providing an interesting plot to go alongside the beautiful illustrations.Recommended for anyone who's read any of the Saga books."
1,OOPS!,My husband requested this title for a Christmas gift. Neither he nor I realized the item is a COMIC BOOK. Our mistake! We returned it.
2,The shoes are pretty but are not confortable,The shoes are very pretty however the leather is very hard. They are not confortable to walk like other flats shoes. If you want just to show pretty shoes that are flats then this is a good choice.
3,Mostly bland and repetitive,"Most of the 3 stars I'm giving this game is for the minute Simpsons references - things like Popsicle Skyscraper and the 50 ft. Magnifying Glass. It seems that the designers of the game were either pretty big Simpsons buffs, or just knew how to do research. With respect to creating a Springfield, this game deserves a lot of credit.With respect to actually being a fun game, especially one that could have drawn so many elements from the games it attempts to emulate (Grand Theft Auto series), the game sadly fails. Yes, all your favorite Simpsons characters are there with authentic voices, but almost every single mission in this game consists of Bring X to Y or Race Y to Z.Overall, Hit & Run is a nice looking, but dull and boring game."
2,"boring, boring, and BORING","Simpsons mixed with GTA.....sounds great, right?? That's what I thought until I spent several days playing the exact same three missions over and over.....and over again. Every single missions is either one of three things: racing someone, hiting something with your car, or getting somewhere by a certain time. The fact that its set in Springfield is its only saving grace, as gameplay is marginal at best. This is a rental if I've ever seen one.....don't waste your money."
2,it's not that great,this game can be described in one word. mediocre the graphics are poor and since when is the family car a convertible? missions are tedious and arn't even fun. if you get the police on you there's no running all they do is ticket you if they get within 20 yards...Rent dont buy
1,It has it's moments (I mean MOMENT....singular),"The ONLY thing I liked about this game was that you could beat up little kids, which is fun, admit it. I was dissapointed, being a huge fan of the show."
1,After a Few Hits You'll Want to Run,"This game is not worth anything. I played this game and it was okay for about 3 missions. Then it got extremely dull. The missions became repetitive and didn't make sense. The driving in this game is lame, along with graphics. If you want a real racing game get Need for Speed Most Wanted. If you liked Destroy All Humans then you might like this game. I didn't like Destroy All Humans, which also got repetitive with missions. Also if you fail a mission, you have to go back and redo the entire mission over again, which is really annoying. Watch some gameplay on Youtube before buying."
3,"Fun at first, but...","I bought this game and had a blast for the first few hours I played it. After that it started getting repetitive. It has all the characters I love from the show, but it just gets stale in my opinion, the missions seem to be the same one with just a different outcome (races, find a certain amount of items before the time runs out, etc). If you are looking for a GTA ripoff, this is kinda it. It has the same elements, but the missions only allow you to play one character per area, and other characters cannot go into those areas (unless this happens later in the game, I got too bored to find out).My suggestion is to rent it, and if you arent bored after the first few days, buy a copy. Maybe its just me who got bored easily."
1,never would order,I would never have ordered this what on earth would I have this charge back please i nrver got it
4,Good game but gets boring,My title says it all. It's fun while it lasted but after a while it gets boring. But the game is fun. You should rent it.
1,Game came broken,"My son really wanted this game. Waited anxiously for daily mail. The game came with a large crack in it. Obviously, sent to us that way, not broken in transit. I emailed the seller twice with no response. I am out a few bucks, my son is sad and I would never buy from this seller again.I have purchased about 10 items from amazon all others met or exceeded my expectations - from games, to videos and books!!"
1,Worst Game Ever!,This is the worst game ever (seriously). The missions are fun for the first two carachter levels but then they get way too repetitve and not worth doing. DONT BUY JUST BECAUSE THE THEME IS SIMPSONS!
3,"Good game, but hard as heck.","I've always liked the Simpsons because of their humor, adventures, and cute diologue, even though they can be crude at times. It's no wonder why I would play this game. I rented it from a video store, and played for 5 days straight.There were many levels I had a hard time passing. I had to repeat some levels 5 to 6 times before finally letting me skip it. Level 7, the one where you play as Grandpa to get some nuclear waste from the power plant and deliver it to the aliens is near impossible. I must have played that level 25 times and never passed it.Overall, the game has cute graphics and fun levels. The scenery is cool too. However, some levels are extremely hard to pass. Good luck."
4,Frustrating,"If you're a Simpsons fan, you'll obviously like the game because, hey, it's the Simpsons. You can't go wrong with that. If you're not a fan though, you probably won't be reading this anyways...SO yes it's cool because it's the Simpsons and there are actual missions on this game. Missions are actually ok; there is some flexibility in being able to skip them; some flexibility as to which character you are. All of these are good things.The chief complaint I have is that this game is too hard (or maybe I just suck really badly). Missions are beatable but they take forever. My friend and I took turns getting frustrated and passing the controller to each other. A Beginner/Easy Skill Level would have been nice. So it's frustratingly difficult which really takes away from the fun of it all. I wouldn't buy it for that reason - rent it and see how you do at it (or in my case, don't do at it) first."
5,Best simpsons game in the galaxy,"The characters are great, levels are great,graphics are amazing, and there's great comedy."
4,It would be better if you rent it,"This is one of the most awesome games I've ever played. But there are some parts that are very stressful. In the game you play as Homer, Bart, Lisa, Margie. My favorite character was Homer because he was alot more better than all of them. So if you want this game you can at least rent it."
2,Ugh. Too many Race missions.,"I'm only on level 2, but there are too many annoying race missions that seem impossible to win. Even a couple of the timed missions(like the meat(mission 5) and monkey one(6) on level 2)there isn't enough time to complete. This game is a Headache in more ways than one. Too hard for kids and a tad challenging even for adults. Stupid video game designers--a game is SUPPOSED TO BE Fun, not a headache.Update 7/21: I finished all the levels(thru 7-7) after taking a break several days. But most missions a headache and not worth playing again."
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE,"This purchase was my first purchase with this vendor and I must say their service and delivery are EXCELLENT! If I could get service like this in retail stores I would not be shopping on-line. If you want great service, fast delivery and good prices-shop here. I ordered the game on Saturday night and received it on Tuesday afternoon. Many thanks for making the holiday shopping so easy."
4,Great Game,"This Game is one of the best Games made for PS2. I highly recomend this game. It is funny, fun, and action. With all your favorite charecter."
2,Little disappointed,"Having an MBA degree and being involved with M&A on a regular basis, this book offered me not much more than its bottomline ""put people together to make things work"". I expected a more concrete elaboration on ""how to"" deal with post-merger cultural issues. The books is filled with cliches and stories you will remember from HR courses in college, it does not offer you many ""real world"" experiences. The CDrom is not really of an added value."
1,Useless Book,"This is an absolutely poor book of no added-value to the reader. It is poorly written (not much text anyway, more bullet points)."
2,Ok,I was disappointed there is no depth to the story. I have been reading a lot of romances lately and this writers story I rank low on my list.
3,Solid 3 - predictable and formulaic.,Enjoyed the characters - found the premise to be predictable - nothing to recommend the book past the 3 stars. But certainly worth the time I invested. I escaped.
4,ok,"Out of the other Tomb Raider novels I have read, this one was the best. The storyline was better, and it seemed to capture the feel of the games more than the others. But at some parts it was confusing. The cover shows Ekhardt (Angel of Darkness), but he isn't even mentioned. Also, reading ""New Strategy"" a gazillion times gets a bit boring."
2,when talk is not cheap,"The criticism that a lot of the perfume and aromatherapy community has leveled at this book has been that there is nothing in this book that is not already in print. I'd be willing to agree with that. Considering that Chrissie Wildwood is out of print, and that Arctander and Tisserand are hard to find inexpensively, this book is an okay stand-in for those which preceded it. It is not the final authority however, despite the glowing reviews. Get the original works from these three authors if you possibly can, if you consider yourself a perfumery scholar."
4,goodgame,this is a pretty goog game I would have to admit it is scarythe story is great. the gore makes it realistic. overall its really fun and i recomend it.
3,Not as bright as original,"NOt as bright as the original bulb. Dimmer has limited range, otherwise workable.. but for the the price..overall condition it's acceptable."
2,Disappointing,The premise of the book was good the execution however was not. A large portion of the book was repetitive especially concerning the h's feelings. I could not find it in myself to like her at all. The H was not a fully fleshed out character in my humble opinion.
4,Vivid writing - difficult life,"This is a book I remembered for 30 years and went back one day recently to find. I was not disappointed although I can see why this book appealed to me so strongly as a 20 year old. Isabelle is an amazing writer. Like the writers of haiku, Isabelle captures the beauty of the desert around her and her feelings about her life in so few words and yet so beautifully. Her love of her adopted country and religion season her view and experience of life. One might wish she had had a happier time of it or been a little better at making a living, but overall this brief book is an amazing contribution to the world by a very unusual person. I highly recommend it."
1,Something creepy this way comes,"I can't put my finger on it but there was something about Isabelle Eberhardt that just made my skin crawl. I didn't like her as a person and never really got to care about her or what happened to her. It's strange because normally I love this kind of book about unconventional women living outside of society's expected norms for them, but this woman, I just did not like!"
2,Meh,"Despite the album art (12 traditional instruments, none of which are drums) there sure is a lot of western-sounding percussion and other electronic effects on the recording. I'm pretty broad-minded and listen to a lot of world music, but I find very little on this album to recommend it. If you want traditional Chinese music, keep looking elsewhere. If you want Asian-flavored generic instrumental pop, you might like this."
3,Got on my nerves after awhile,"Loved the video of them in concert, but without the visuals this music gets on your nerves after awhile. IN rotation with other genres it serves as a refreshing break, but listening the whole thing in a row could be considered Chinese Torture."
2,MISSED THE MARK!!!,"The 12 Girls are EXCELLENT musicians, unfortunately the technical quality of this CD is poor. It has been over mastered. Many of the songs have limited dynamic range due to over compression evidently in the pursuit of getting maximum level. Also some of the musical arrangements are poor and not suited to the Chinese instruments used to play them. I would say pass on this album and look for something with better recording, mastering, and overall better sound quality. Some of the recordings that I heard in China are superior to this album."
3,Chinese Insync,"My wife hit them on the nose - ""more like Insync than Dixie Chicks"". Ie they are manufactured. They grin too much, and dance around awkwardly. Too bad because I love Asian music. I will say it is heads above J-pop. Probably would be a lot better without watching the video"
3,Clocks,"I bought this CD just so I could hear their stellar arrangement of Coldplay's, ""Clocks"" over and over again. Well worth the purchase price as their version is other-worldly beautiful."
1,Wonderful CD!,"The Twelve Girls Band Western debut is remarkable! Several memorable tracks include ""Only Time"" ""New Classicism"" ""Alabruham"" and ""Clocks"" (the rendition on the Coldplay song) The traditional chinese instruments give a very exotic, almost haunting air to the slow tempo songs, and adds a bit of whimsy to the up tempo ones. The Bonus DVD as well is a good extra as you watch the women play live in a concert from Japan. Seeing their expressions as they play their songs shows how passionate they are to their music.This is definatly a CD worth buying.Oh and I messed up with the stars, this is DEFINATLY worth FIVE STARS."
5,Wow,"A while back I said it was rare that any good music came out like it used to. Boy has 2004 proved me wrong! This CD is probably the pinnacle of neo-classical music. The 12 young ladies play with such emotion that you can hear it on the CD. I think it's amazing work and my favorite songs are Miracle, Clocks and New Classicism.This CD is great just to sit on the beach and listen to in the morning."
5,I Love Twelve Girls Band,I purchased his as a replacement. I had given my original as a gift and then missed it greatly. I would love to find some new material from Twelve Girls Band!!
5,"Wonderful, I loved every other second and cried the rest.",I could not wait for this book to come out and am pulling my hair out for the next. You become so attached to the charactors with each book that you anticipate their every move. It was magic.
4,"Good, but not as great as Ruins of Ambrai.","Ms. Rawn did a great job in writing this novel--she truly has a great style of writing. The subtle hints that are imbedded throughout Mageborn Traitor and Ruins of Ambrai are entertaining and attention grabbing. I personally liked the fact that women are dominant over men on Lenfell, and it shows a lot of creative ingenuity. The only thing that I found a slight problem with is that one of the three most popular characters, Collan, was killed off. I sincerely hope that in the Captal's Tower his story will be revealed. By the way, when is the Captal's Tower due to come out?? I know that I will look forward to it's release!!"
4,I loved it.,"I thuroughly enjoyed this book. Through Ms. Rawn's description of the characters and their world, you experience their feelings. It almost transports you to their world. The only things I did not like were the killing off of a favorite character and the revelation of the imposter. Other than that, Melanie Rawn did a superb job on this book. I would recommend it to all who like reading fantasy."
3,disappointment in an avid reader of Rawn,"Being only fifteen years old I haven't the same reading experiences as some. But, I was very disappointed in Rawn's newest book. She was my gateway into fantasy and I have enjoyed all her work published with the exception of her new book. In her new book I actually knew what was going to happen to the characters before it happened because of the striking simalarity to her other series. I also felt that she tried to 'tackle' to many issues in her book such as child rights, and sexism... making the book a little rough around the edges. I more than likely will buy her next book whenever it comes out ( does anyone know when it does?? ) just in the hopes that it is equal to her other stuff. If anyone knows any books that I would enjoy that are similar to Rawn's past books I would be grateful if you e-mailed me since I don't have much time to browse.-christine"
5,The Mageborn Traitor,This book is interesting. I could not put it out of my thoughts! I really like this book and cannot wait to read the next one!
4,Typical middle book in a trilogy,"It was hard deciding what star rating to give this book. I wanted to give it a three because i felt that this book suffered from a plot that dragged in places, but on the other hand i could see where the author was heading. I can almost feel all the plot threads twisting tighter.This is what I always feel happens in a trilogy, everyone knows that there are is another book to come so the middle book is in many cases just padding or fleshing out details. This book suffers from that in a big way. While some of the plot twists are enjoyable, the book just seemed to go on and on only getting to the point at the very end. I wish i could give this book a 3 and a half stars - which is a more accurate rating for this book - and i could get the edited version, a book that would be well over 200 - 300 pages shorter.I will buy the next book in this series as i think it wil be very exciting to see where all the characters end up.3.5 stars is my true rating"
1,Rawn misses out,"I have to admit, Rawn is one of my all time favorite authors but like so many other fans, I'm sick of waiting for the end of the trilogy. She has written other stories since book two of Exiles but I haven't bought any of them. She's a great writer,no doubt but Exiles has been left hanging far too long. Robert Jordan has put out numerous additional titles in his series while we have all been waiting for the last of the Exiles trilogy. To be honest, I've lost interest in Rawn as a writer. I have all of the Dragon Prince books in hardcover and will enjoy reading them over and over again but I'm sorely tempted to just toss the Exiles books as there seems to be no conclusion to the storyline. I'm giving the ""duology"" a rating of one star due to the lack of interest from the author in completing the story. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this ""trilogy"" until after the third book, if ever, is published."
4,Waiting.....,"As in all of Melanie's works I was completly submerged in the story and characters. I loved the Sunrunners series and was captivated once again in the Exiles books 1,2 and, as is becoming much more prevelent with authors today the next book in the series which is still not released. This is the second series in which Rawn has yet to produce a concluding book. What has it been now? Almost 4 years? We had a brief respite in the Golden Key which was published in 2000. The next book in that series has also been on hold. I know Rawn will probably never read these but just in case I will let my opinion be known.Another note, I sincerely hope that she does not kill off all of the main characters in the end as she did in the Sun-runner's series. This Author is a buyer be aware. You will love the books but become frustrated in the end."
1,"The Mageborn Traitor (Exiles, Vol 2)","I enjoyed reading the book up until I realized that the most colorful person, and my favorite person in both books was killed off. It was like watching the young female doctor on ER killed off, and I stopped watching that too. The only reason I can see for killing this person off was because he was a very strong male person, and Ms. Rawn doesn't like strong males lasting too long. Because of this, I don't care when the next book comes out."
2,Worked great for about 6 months,"I loved this thing when I got it and used it every day during my train commute to and from work. It worked fantastic ... the sound was awesome and it was more than loud enough with the sony headphones I bought for it. I recommend buying aftermarket headphones since the headphones that come with it are big and [crazy] looking and don't sound too great. Then all of a sudden one day the headphone jack (where you plug the headphones in) just stopped working. For a while if I twisted the little plug the right way it would work, but then it just stopped working alltogether. I tried three other pairs of headphones including the ones it came with, and none of them worked. Hopefully mine was an isolated case, but I don't think I would ever buy this again."
2,SCRATCHES your CDs,"This player has excellent bass and sound quality, won't skip and will run on batteries reasonably long; which is a shame because it just might scratch your CDs. After owning it for 6 months, the player started abruptly stopping (and shutting down) in the middle of tracks. The lens also began to make circular scratches on the CDs it played - very irritating indeed (this is usually the sign of a very cheaply make CD player). I never rocked it around or dropped it, or did anything that would cause this - it just started happening on its own. Now I have to replace it AND one of the music CDs that got quite a bit of playtime, and you can bet I'll not go with Philips again."
4,CD Player for all seasons,"After lots of reasearch online, This one turned out oto be the best for me, and it's $20 less than the other ones. It has great skip protection, a hold function, a battery indicator that works, and it's incredibly thin. And its a lot cheaper than other translucent CD Players. This is a great Buy, even through this site,and that says something."
3,skip protection is less than desired,"I am a runner. I bought this CD player because of the electronic skip protection. The players skips like crazy. I am very happy with the sound. But if you are running or something similar that jolts the unit, it will skip very badly. Too bad it claims anti-skip, because it does not work.-Chuck"
2,Misses its mark,"This could be a valuable book, but its worth is diminished by a fairly large number of mistakes. Buildings are mis-identified. Some photos of Wright's decorative features are printed upside down. Other photos are backwards. Several of the aerial views are dramatic, but others seem to be space fillers. One in particular of Forest Avenue in Oak Park shows no details of the homes except for the roofs. With a bit more care in the choice of prints, the photos could have a far greater impact on the reader's understanding of Wright's design genius."
4,Thats the stuff,"Dance Dance Dance. Thats all I want to do when I hear this cd. The first half of the first disc is really good. Too good in fact because just like when im partying the lights come on and I look around and say ""where the hell have I been dancing all night?"" Its a good mix and I love it but I think it ends so quietly. The second disc is mixed really well and I like to chill to it. All in all its worth whatever you pay for it."
5,Theres no shame in this girl!,"ani difranco is beautiful song writer,and always sweeps me off my feet.This album relates to me in everyday life.#4 on the cd is my favorite, it makes me cry with delighted tears.I saw Ani twice in my life and both times she looked increidible.I listen to her music everday especially the album Dilate.If any way I could meet this girl it would be a dream come true.She is truly my superhero! Enjoy this cd, it will bring a sound so different to you that it will overtake your mind and body with a feeling so promised and cherished! Thank you Ani!"
3,A Disappointment - Not Up To Ten Years After Standards,"I was a fan of Alvin Lee and Ten Years After when I was in high school back in the early 1970s, but I lost touch with Alvin Lee's solo music after the last Ten Years After album.I saw this one recently on Amazon so I decided to check it out.It was a disappointment. I thought perhaps it would grow on me with repeated playings, but it didn't.The album has some decent tracks, like Alvin's Blue Thing, but there's nothing here that matches Alvin Lee's standards from the Ten Years After days.I hate to say it, but my advice to Ten Years After fans is to pass on this one."
4,"Looks great, pressure is good..mostly","I do love my faucet, however, I have found that on occasion the lever controlling the water tends to fall down and the water turns off, this is particularly problematic when the water is going at a slow stream, if I have it going full on then it is less likely to turn itself off."
1,Hopeless IR Keyboard,What a piece of crap. This item is priced ~50% less than competitors - now I know why. The item simply would not communicate with my iPaq 4355. I tried every angle possible to get the keyboard to communicate with the PDA. Don't waste your money on this item.
1,Get NHL 07 instead,"Played them both but nothing compares to the new SKILL STICK revolution in NHL 07, it has changed the way you will play hockey games.....for the better!!Everything screams next-gen in 07 where this kinda still looks like xbox."
4,Not your next Gen NHL Game,"If you love this series like I do, than buy the game. Its improved on a lot of things from last years release. Which mind you a lot of people said was buggy. The graphics aren't next gen but who cares. If you aren't a die hard must have perfect graphics, this games for you. Don't be afraid of other reviews saying its NHL 07. Nothing is ever an EA Sports release. So don't try. This game ha a great feel and is just plain fun for all ages. Who care if other are more challenging. Enjoy its hockey at its best."
2,"Quality seems good, but it didn't ""work""",Purchased this (as well as black cohosh) at the recommendation of a doula and several other holistically inclined momma types in order to give mother nature a nudge. Unfortunately it did not work and after several weeks I resorted to surgery anyway.
1,Seriously - Don't Bother!,"OK, I bought this game with great anticipation because I love the concept and I love the genre. Wow, what a huge disappointment when my 1 year old computer couldn't play it due to graphics card issues - it doesn't run on GeForce 4 cards. Not to be beaten, I tried to upgrade my graphics card for another $100. Did you know that you can't upgrade Dell graphics cards? Well, I couldn't. So I waited six months and finally broke down and bought a brand new computer with an ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card. Well, it's still no good. Now the graphics card is too fast! I tried adjusting it to slow it down, but the sound skips and the graphics are jumpy and the game is completely unplayable. Huge disappointment. These guys are on my list of games to avoid."
4,Complicated and beautiful,"When I first bought this game, I assumed I would be getting it for the PS2, I misread it when I was sleep deprived.I was peeved at first, but then realised it was a simple mistake on my part, and I took advantage of it, and am now enjoying this game.However this game is complicated, the movements are hard to get used to, the puzzles are a nice refreshing challenge, and you actually have to search EVERYTHING.Next, if anyone has found a good walkthrough lol, I am stuck and can only find PS2 walkthroughs :) thank you!"
3,game installed and runs fine on my xp,I have an xp that i bought back in 2006 and the game installed and works fine. Only bad thing is the navigation is tricky but i eventually got better at it.
1,Doesn't work,This game would not work. I tried to install multiple times. Always got a Access_exception_violation. No help found at 2k's web site. Buy at your own risk. I had to choose a rate but that wasn't fair because the game doesn't deserve even one star and there was no ability to choose zero.
1,impossible!,"I cannot play it! I can never win the combats, which is the reason that I cannot play the game! It is impossible!"
1,Can't play game and no support response,"I bought this game and tried to install on my Dell notebook (which I play many full-graphic games with) but I couldn't even play. While the first mission's loading, the game shut down and I've got the message...EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION(Slayer) Exception address e86aa20[5, Map_PostInit, 0xFFFFFFFF]IMAGE HELP STACK:ITriggerVisualDatabase::GetSingleton+9930MAP FILE STALKWALK:...I uninstalled and reinstalled but the same message kept coming. I tried to install on my desktop and still the same. I thought maybe it's the error of the DVD so I went back to the shop and claim to get a new one. After I tried installing, always the same problem so I gave up and claim my money back from the shop. However, I wrote to the support to ask about the problem, no reply. Now I think I won't buy this game anymore, it doesn't worth my time and money, just got me mad. I hope the others won't be unlucky like I was."
1,Never got started,I was unable to play this game because it required a special sound card which I did not have and was unwilling to purchase (cost $50-$100). I found this peculiar since no other game that I've purchased in the last 10 years has required this sound card. Why create a game that requires some obscure kind of hardware??
1,Won't run on my computer,"I have a fairly new Dell computer bulit with gaming in mind, I have many other games that run flawlessly. This game gives me an error of Slayer Exception address 456c410, as yet I have not received any help from the support group, I will update this if I get it to run."
1,Won't even work in a new dell gaming computer,"I have a brand new dell computer built for gaming and this game won't play, I get an exception_access_ violation error that reads (slayer) exception address (4b7bd9) (no game crash info) image help stack: TArchive ::operation=+BO599 Map file STALK WALK.And not to mention when I tried to take the game back, the store wouldn't give me my money nor let me exchange it with anything but this product. I wouldn't buy this game unless you are 100% sure your machine has major upgrades.would be happy to hear from others with this problem or anyone that has suggestion on fixing it"
1,My computer too!,I spent most of the afternoon downloading patches and upgrades and still the thing won't work. BEWARE buyer! This game was obviously not designed for the average computer. Too bad too.
3,crazy,"$14.99 now? Really? If it wasn't selling at $3.99 which is what the price was 2 days ago and has been for a while now, do you really think someone wants to spend $11 more for it now? Who knows if the price will go up again after I post this message. Yes, it's a import. Pick a price and stick with it or lower it because the item is not selling. I really don't understand the way some people think on this stuff."
4,Not too shabby,The picture seemed pretty grainy when i first started using it. After fiddling with the exposure it got better. Otherwise I really dig it. Nightshot works really well. Menus are pretty usable too. Only other thing is the battery only lasts about an hour. The 16.5 hour battery they talk about is sold separately for over $100.
4,Great action figure!,"My 3 yr old grandson fell in love with Superman. I got this one for him since it has the sound effects, movement, etc. He adores it. He flies him all over the house! Very neat toy! Great price! Very durable!"
3,Does Not Play Superman Theme Song,I got this for my soon to be 4 year old son after he fell in love with a Superman card that played the Superman March Theme Song. The product description claimed it played the Superman theme song. He is very disappointed it does not play the song as described. I should not have hyped it with this feature or trusted anything besides the Manufacturer's description (which does not claim the theme song can be played). The 3 star rating is due to the incorrect description being provided. I am hoping my son enjoys the toy soon though...
3,Ultra Powered Superman,This figure is a lot of fun. It's not very poseable but kids will love the sounds and effects.
3,A FANTASTIC LITTLE FILM I'VE NEVER HEARD OF.,"Quite accidently, I stumbled onto this film. What a great story, and good cast. A tidy little noir from our English cousins!But the quality of this DVD is not that impressive. Sharpness and contrast are not the worse I've ever seen; but certainly doesn't look much better than an Alpha release at times. (Who is WHAM USA, anyway???)Despite the fact that it is single layered, the DVD offers no extras with the exception of a very lame slide show of images from the film that I suppose are to take the place of genuine stills. Truly a disappointment of a release and a shame as the film is prime noir. The only real incentives to purchase it is the outstanding quality of the film , story and cast, and the fact that it's relatively cheap at the moment.BUT THIS FILM DESERVES A CLASS ""A"" RELEASE!!!"
3,"WHY, Bill ??","I kept asking myself - why didn't Bill start a fire to create smoke and alert a rescue? He had everything he needed in his prison: matches, kindling, wood, a bathtub and access to water. Why, Bill? WHY ??"
5,Ahmed ROCKS,"I try to visit one of France's largest electronics and music stores, FNAC, whenever I am in Paris and to purchase music that I would not know about otherwise. That is how I found this magnificent performer and the current production being reviewed here. His work is melodic, super emotional, and totally moves me at every level. I hope that Amazon.com will soon have more of his work available and would encourage anyone that loves music to purchase this CD!"
3,Bowling for Aliens,"I read this book a long time ago but remember it fondly. It is a light and light-hearted story in the ""aliens among us"" genre wherein the visitors resemble nothing so much as Brunswick's finest and, of the denouement, it may fairly be said that the reader is ""skunked."" Simak was a good science fiction writer--one who was not part of the 50's technocrat SF crowd and not quite far enough along to belong to the socially--overconscious 60's ""new wave"" types."
4,Have a fast gun?,"If you have an electro, you need a fast loader. The Halo B is at the top of the loader market. It will feed as fast as you need to shoot. It's also durable and has a pretty low profile. There are a few minor nuisances with halos such as it is difficult to clean, the drive cone can break, and it uses 6 AA batteries. There are aftermarket parts available to correct all of these minor issues. The only hoppers I would reccommend over the standard Halo B are the Halo B with Rip Drive (very handy should the batteries fail) or the Emipre Reloader B."
4,The Simpsons in the 30th century,"I Love this show. But because of bad programmers at FOX, this show is no more (who thinks this should have been on following the Simpsons)? Maybe then the show would have fared better.At least they are getting a good sendoff. The game (from what I've seen from screenshots)looks amazing and not to mention funny. However since it's being billed as a ""lost episode"" or final episode it's worth it just to watch a regular TV episode which is what matt Groenig (who's supervising the entire project) is billing it as."
5,a bombshell of a war movie,"This is a movie about the other aspects of war, and would not look out of place alongside of 'Soldier Blue' 'Welcome Home' or the TV series 'Anzacs'. Sharky (Bob Hoskins) poses as a Unicef worker in war-torn Bosnia, as a cover for his illegal activities. He convinces Vlado (Sergiusz Zymelka), a nine- year old bosnian orphan that he is there to take him to a better life abroad. This is a powerful story about the forgotten victims of war, and about the need to care."
4,"Love the designs, but not ready to use","The designs are fabulous, but extra steps are needed to make actual stencils. These are merely great designs on paper."
3,Not Bad for the price,"I purchased two of these wooden hose reels, and the quality of the wood is OK. I stained them to match my outdoor furniture, which made a huge difference. Mechanically, the auto-rewind feature is cool, but you have to have a spot for the runoff water to go. I have a 75' Soft and Supple 5/8"" hose, and it won't fit completely on this reel. I have at least 10' that still remains out when the inside mechanism starts to jam. Nicest looking hose reel in the neighborhood though!"
4,THIS GAME LOOKS AWESOME!!!!!!,"I have been tracking this game ever since word of it came out. This looks like it could possibly be the best game ever to be based off of a TV show. If you are a Futurama fan, this game is a must have. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that they cancelled the GameCube version of the game, which is the only system of the 3 I own right now. But I know that if I get a PS2, this will be one of the first games I will get."
2,What I think,"I love the futurama t.v show.It is so funney. I have done some reseach on this came and it is about Dr. Farnsworth sells something to the robot lady,Mom and it is something that allows her to take over 50% of earth making her the sumpreme ruler of earth and you have to stop her. I think it will be a great game."
3,differed from posted illustration,the coil insert tool that was included in the set was different from the diamond shaped handle that was used in the illustration. The tool that was sent does work but doesn't match my existing set.
4,It is what it is.,"Fit the Saturn just fine. Edges are square (not round like the factory ones), but I don't even notice anymore. Easy to install."
5,A must-have,"If you're looking to flight instruct, this book is necessary. Coupled with The airplane flying handbook, and oral exam guide you're sure to pass the checkride."
3,Rated Version not that great,"I remember seeing this movie some years ago and decided to buy it. This is the rated version that seems to have most of the sex scenes edited. If you want this movie, try to get the unrated version."
4,Small big band??,"It seems that the small band experience of this group often made it difficult for them to use the full power of a ""big band."" I often thought I was listening to a really talented quintet instead of a big band. In some pieces, of course, the full power of the ""big band"" came through such as in Danny Boy. It's a great group but I wish that their arrangements were more oriented to using the full power of the band on all the cuts."
5,Awsome!,The food saver products work very well. The size is perfect for small items. I think I buy more of them.
1,Not Worth The Money,"I bought these because they are smaller than the other Food Saver containers. They aren't anything more than harder Rubbermaid/Tupperware-like items. They do not hold a seal for longer than 2 days, 3 tops. We wasted so much food using these. The lid has a removable gasket, which is nothing more than a plastic rubber band. If it ever comes out (which is does when you clean them, they are that loose), you will never get them back in properly again. I would buy the regular, real Food Saver containers over these any day, even if they are too big; they are the same price and you'll waste less food. I'm getting rid of mine and not even giving them to Goodwill like I normally would."
5,SAVE MONEY AND HAVE FRESH FOOD,Foodsaver is fantastic....I make individual salads in these containers. I have six of these and I can make 3 days worth of salads for my husband and I. They keep them fresh and you can save tons of money. No need for plastic wrap anymore. This also makes these products fantastic for the environment!!!! Love these!
1,Didn't work in my Benz,"Didn't work in my Benz, tried everything to trouble shoot and in the end... it had to be this part of the puzzle."
3,Good value...but,I purchased this to use in a car sound system and it would never work. Unit functions fine for laptop use.
4,Great buy considering similar products out there,"I've just purchased this item, so I'm reserving my fifth star for when I see how it performs over the longer term. The product delivers as promised--looks great on a desk or chest of drawers and works quietly.A note about the settings: if you normalize the settings for a 24-hour period, you'll find that the 33 sec./10 min./30 min./1 hr. settings translate into 60, 160, 240 and 480(!) minutes of rotation in a day, respectively, which seems counter-intuitive to me because I would've thought that more time between rotations would mean fewer overall rotations in a day. I'm not a mechanical watch expert (I only recently acquired a second one, hence this purchase) but from what I've read its not a good idea to wind one too much, too long."
4,Good but not loud,"This cd player is a really good one, it's taken quite a bit of abuse I've given it and still works great. I also like the cd-rw capability. The only thing I don't like about this cd player is that it isn't very loud. I usually have to have the volume on about 7-9 when I listen to it. It's pretty bad when there's lots of background noise and it drounds out your music."
5,All You Need and then Some,"Unless you want an AM/FM tuner or MP3 capabilities, this is as goo as it gets. The 40 (I thought it was 45) second skip protection is perfect. It is perfect for jogging, since the anti-skip actually seems to rid it of skipping at all. The car kit allows you to hook your CD player to you cars audio system via casette rack, enabling you to save on the new car you may be buying. Also includes car power adaptor."
4,It was Ok,"I liked it but I think that if you are planning your wedding on your own I would recommand getting ""The Knot"""
5,Best wedding planner available !!!!,I went to the book store and spent several hours reading every available planner. I chose to buy the Beverly Clark Wedding Planner because of the taste level of Ms. Clark as well as the efficiency of the planning organization component.I bought the book on Amazon because they had the best price available. I used the book to plan our wedding and it was truly a life saver. Our wedding was simply lovely and we enjoyed every moment. We even bought the Beverly Clark wedding accessories at www.bridalsalon.com.Congradulations and good luck on your wedding plans!!!!!Heidi
3,Nice Planner although it looked used when it arrived,"I found this planner to be very helpful but when it arrived it looked as if it had been purchased before, The outside cover had dirt stains and the binding was worn. I sent an e-mail with my concerns but no reponse...I am a little disapointed."
3,cant live without.,"I was at a loss on how to arrange my first marriage till I came across this little piece of genius, Ive been to many a wedding, but the only one anyone else remembers is uncle terrys where he was caught touching up the bridesmaid. hopefully with this book, they may remember mine instead."
3,Wedding to Remember,"the book was great but the cover had dirty marks on it, Not very happy as its a wedding book and something that i would like to keep forever"
5,The Best Wedding Book in the World!,"I loved this book, it is a must have for any soon to-be-bride. Buy it and you won't regret it or need any other book, this one has it all. This book is a life saver for every bride. I have recommended it and given it to a few friends since I have been married. It is great for someone who wants everything orgranized in one book and likes to make notes. It has answers to many wedding questions and also has tips and hints for brides that have never helped plan a wedding before. This book saved me from more stress than neccesary. It is also a great to look through and remind myself of what a beautiful and special day it helped bring me and my husband."
2,A Disappointment,"I have really taken to the blues over the last few months and have been expanding my library. Seems from what I've heard that I'd better get a Michael Bloomfield cd. I chose this one due to it being remastered. I need the best sound qaulity as I have a expensive stereo system. I guess I picked the wrong one. The sound is not the best and I found many of the songs annoying. I only liked 3 tunes on the whole cd, one of which was instrumental. Not near as good as most of the blues cd's i have purchased. I think I'll return it."
3,Disappointing,It is too bad this could not be an actual flute music CD. It is more piano and orchestra than flute. What about the idea of having an album with just flute music?
1,Don't bother,"I got this book based on it's description and the fact that I have some erotica written by the same author. However I learned nothing from this book that I didn't already learn from my own trial and error.This MIGHT be an okay book if you just do it missionary style and want to add some flair to your sex life. One suggestion in the book was to masterbate....I learned that years ago. Everything in it just a basic suggestion and doesn't go into detail. You could learn all the content in this book, plus more, just by searching [ ... ]"
1,A piece of defective junk,"I paid plenty for this phone and expected it to work. However, the keypad never worked properly. Numbers which I dialed were not received by the phone, or numbers which I did not dial were received instead. Within 10 months, the phone's reception was not working consistently, crackling and making it impossible to use. I tried replacing the battery, which I had to order by mail.... No dice, the problem remains. I called the maker, TT Systems, and they told me that since it was out of warranty, tough luck. I'll never buy another ""IBM"" phone again, and IBM should be more careful about their licensed products. Buyer beware!"
5,The Joy of Words,This book is a delight. The narative is fun to read and the information the book imparts is easy to understand and fun to learn.
2,Not helpful for a ten year old!,"I didn't find this book helpful, and here's why: My 10 year old daughter tends to over eat and crave unhealthy foods, so I'm working on educating her on nutrition and keeping her active. I thought this book looked like a good resources, but the problem is that it looks like a young child's book, even though it contains good information in the second half, appropriate to an older child. So, my 10 year old took one look at it, declared it a 'baby's book' (because the cover and art and first pages look like it's designed for a very young child), and I couldn't get her further in it, because she prides herself on now being able to read 'big kid' (chapter type) books. The packaging/art approach just don't match the level of the content!"
3,Good but darn that old food pyramid,"I ordered the book online. It is colorful and does contain some really good information given in a way that kids are willing to read and discuss it. I am pleased it is detailed, discussing protein, vitamins and such. However, I was quite disappointed to see the old food pyramid. I thought by now that it wouldn't still be going into books about nutrition. If I could easily rip that page out I would. Frustrating"
4,beautiful sandstone7,"This sandstone really is beautiful. It is of very good quality. I gave it a four star for two reasons...firstl I expected to receive it with three holes predrilled for a faucet and secondly I find the color to have more gray colors as apposed to sandy tones. I took it to our granite and marble place to have the holes drilled in. I lovethe sink. Easy to clean, well built, ."
2,Brief Overview of Slapstick,"""Slapstick Too"" is a brief (no special features) hour and a half overview of clips from various slapstick films highlighting these main actors. Sadly, there are no film titles. Although the film does compare the slapstick of the early century to clips from films of the late 30's, I was hoping for more car, plane, and train chases and even the Keystone Cops. The final five minutes is worth watching because of the funny quick montage set to ""can can"" music. Being a Laurel and Hardy fan, I was glad to see their moments, but this 1998 version lacks some of the funny sight gags set to turn-of-the century LA.I know that I've seen another VHS from before the 90's that did highlight the Keystone Cops and that they are probably fading on VHS, too expensive to buy on DVD, or in a vault somewhere. A great for young ones and the family to rent, but probably worth less to buy than the retail price."
3,OK,"This book is pretty good read, but it seems like he was just getting started when it ended. I'm excited to read more of his work. i'm thinking he has the talent just not so much in this book"
3,slow reading,kind of slow and tedious. I have tried to like this book but just cant seem to get into it. it took a long time to get to anything that seems resonably interesting but i still have not gotten to anything relevant to the title
2,Not so much.....,"This was my first read of Gothic-horror. Not my cup of tea, although I managed to finish it. I appreciated the author's skills and will probably read another one of her books, just not Gothic/horror."
3,"Clegg, Breeder","Breeder by Clegg was a nice little horror novel to pass the time between more memorable horror novels. It wasn't my first Clegg read and does not stand out in my memory as anything fantastic. I thought of it as a sort of Rosemary's Baby, only without the incredible use of psychological horror. Nothing bad here, but I have nothing that positive to say about it except for it being very well-written and, in the horror field, this is something worthy of mention."
5,Can't stop listening to it,"I don't know what expectations the Amazon reviewer had but I for one can't stop listening to ""I Dug Up A Diamond"" - which is how I feel about this CD."
5,Two voices that blend and harmonize well!,"If you enjoy Emmylou Harris, then you will love her voice paired with Mark Knopler's of Dire Straits. Here's hoping that another collaboration is in the works!"
5,Two for the price of one,"This CD delivers! Two great artists with huge talent come together and deliver an awesome musical experience. Emmylou could sing the phone book and sound like an angel and Mark has the deepest soultry voice, accompanied by that famous accoustic guitar. Each and every song is a delight, especially ""This is Us"" and ""Love and Happiness"". Especially haunting is ""All the Roadrunning"", sung by two veterans of traveling on the road to bring their music to the people. Every single song is great. I have listened to it many times already and still sing along and enjoy the music. I love it!"
3,"Not Great Knopfler, but Not Bad Music","As a devout fan of Mark Knopfler, it's hard for me to be too disappointed any time new product appears in the market. Admittedly, this joint effort with Emmylou Harris doesn't approach some of the notable heights he attained with Dire Straits (e.g., ""Brothers in Arms"") or flying solo (e.g., ""Sailing to Philadelphia""), but I always welcome some new guitar mastery as performed by Mr. Knopfler. The old saying I've heard applied to sex might work for my assessment of less than the best efforts by Mark: ""When it's good, it's great; and when it's bad, it's still pretty darn good."" ""All the Roadrunning"" is pretty darn good."
2,These people are still making music?,It would be more interesting to hear Speedy West and Hazel Dickens team up. I dare you to evolve in your listening.
4,Emmylou & Mark,"I would love to disagree with Alana Nash, the Amazon reviewer, but I can't. I love the CD. I love the music, the musicianship, the vocals, but there really is something missing. I wish I could put my finger on it. It could/should have been much better, but maybe I expected worlds to collide."
5,review of all the roadrunning,"fabulous cd!! two great artist, who i never would have thought of together, have made one of the great cds of the year or maybe of all time."
2,Left behind,"I'm afraid this struck me as too much of the same old country that we hear from others. I did not find Harris' voice carrying that extra edge that pulls me into the pathos of her songs with the echoey sounds here. It seems they both left behind the striking qualities that made them stand out from the crowd. Sorry to agree with the official review, but I do."
3,when the whole is less than the sum of the parts,"I love both artists, have numerous CDs by both, and in particular have enjoyed Knopfler's recent melodic journeys. Here too are a few nice songs, as others have described. However, the voices in fact do not blend well, nor are there really very many highlights on this effort. Knopfler's deep, almost spoken voice simply does not work well in consort with Harris's sharp, high and thin voice. This incompatibility is particularly disconcerting in the harmony choral vocals, but even is distracting when one alternates with the other. Few songs are memorable, and fewer still truly excellent. All in all, a very average effort, somewhat lost in practice, while appearing quite exciting ""on paper."" The obvious talent of both redeems this collection somewhat, so that it is still better than a lot out there, but I would rather listen to more than a handful of albums by each done individually before I listen to this again."
4,Enunciate... Please,A good album by two excellent musicians that would have been better if only they had enunciated the lyrics clearer.
2,eh,"Just ""eh."" I like both of them, but both have done better work before. This is OK, pleasant, but offers nothing that I want to blast in the car because I love it so. Just OK."
2,"Chemistry ""NOT""","This is a good technical musical piece of work but I didn't feel there was a great alive feeling with these two together. I'll listen to it again but probably with the same colorless, emotionless lack of memory of anything to whistle to later on feeling I usually like to get from a music experience. Plus, I didn't think there is any point to their title of this collaberation except that they both may be burned out in their art posture."
3,Country Elevator Music,Not up to the best of either Emmylou or Mark. I love both of the musicians and song writers but this CD seemed just a marketing ploy.
1,Is this really comparable to Suprise by Paul Simon?,"I have liked Mark Knopfler's music in the past so when I saw it was recommended in the Amazon catagory of ""people who bought Paul Simon also bought this"" I thought OK lets go for it. Firstly it took ages to arrive and when I played it I could not believe how ordinary and depressing the sound was. As a child on wet Sundays we would struggle to find a radio station that wasn't just Songs of Praise. Inevitably it was whining Country & Weston at it's most melancholy. This album could have featured on one of those shows with Emmylou Harris doubling the whine and depression. Sorry C&W fans, there's lots of it I like, but if this album had arrive within the stipulated return period it would have been straight back."
3,"Not great, but better than average","I love Emmylou Harris and I like Mark Knopfler. Looking at most of the reviews on Amazon, people seem to either give this cd 5 stars or 2...I think it's in between. The songs are good. Not great, but good - the title track is my favorite - and all are very listenable. The singing is the mixed bag here. Knopfler has said that Don Williams is a a big influence on his singing and it's never been more evident than here, but Williams is a better singer. On the other hand, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better singer in the world than Emmylou Harris and her voice shines on these songs like it always does.""All The Roadrunning"" could have been a stunning album. Instead, it is just good - and way better than most of the dreck flooding the airwaves today."
2,GOD how I wanted to love this record...,"But the truth is they both sound like they're asleep. Knopfler's now-standard Nashville sound is great...for about two cuts. Then it's just a drone. Same with EHarris, same with Knopfler, who seems barely able to finish singing the words, like he's going to faceplant at any minute. Even he's not interested, and he wrote most of the material.These two should be able to generate some serious heat, but if this is them, I don't want to know them.Interestingly, there was a PBS Soundstage presentation of a concert of this, and while I found it interesting to watch (because I like seeing how Knopfler plays) I just found it so damn mechanical, just like this record. All the Roadrunning leaves the odometer going 'tick...tick...tick...'"
2,Not a typical Emmylou CD,I really like Emmylou Harris and hoped this CD would reflect similar songs that I enjoy. BUT this CD is really too much country. IF I had known that I would not have bought it.
2,Sorry to go against the flow,"This album is spotty, and leaves much to be desired as a Mark Knopfler project. It has no central anything. And without going into vast detail, this hopefully one off is not worthy of, If you are a collector of all things Knopfler or Emmylou, by all means acquire it. If you like either of these artists, buy their solo albums. This one is a drowse, and I simply do not care for the songs or the playing. They seem calculated and searching without any real answers to anything that the collaboration promises.....might be just me, but I don't think so."
2,Wheres the real Mark Knofler?,"I bought this CD without listening to any tracks, just by my love of the two musicians, but was very disappointed. I have been a Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fan since the beginning. I always see him live whenever he passes through town, but I have to say this CD was very disappointing. The songs are slow and unmemorable and although the two voices are a nice mix, the material doesn't do them justice. The CD is lacking any of the great guitar leads that make Mark Knopfler unique. I wish I had listening to this one before I purchased."
5,Who the heck is the Amazon official reviewer? obviously an incompetent!,"It really makes me sick how hard wannabes try to stand out. Obviously the Amazon official reviewer (Alanna Nash) is a complete incompetent: a person who can't sense the beauty and the depth of WHATEVER Mark Knopfler writes, sings and plays has no right to write such a disgusting review on this beautiful album. As a musician myself I consider Mark Knopfler a true musical genius and in this album the unmistakable sound of Knopfler's guitar and the voice of Emmylou Harris are a match made in heaven. Maybe Ms. Alanna needs a better set of speakers at home, or maybe a new set of ears!"
5,Beautiful,"Alanna Nash needs to take long walk on a short pier. ""Underwhelming?"" Please. This is Mark Knopfler's best record since Sailing to Philadelphia at least, if not Neck and Neck. The songs are perfect jewels with beautiful melodies and great lyrics. And the interplay of Knopfler's and Harris' voices is sublime. If you like Mark Knopfler I guarantee you will like this album.Every time I listen to this record it just sounds better and better. My only regret is that the tour will not be coming to the northwest of the USA."
5,Excellent duet CD,"I purchased this CD as a long time Mark Knopfler fan, i didn't know very much about Emmylou Harris but after listening to this CD i am a big fan of her voice. These two sound great together, very nice mood to this album, nice guitar fills as always, nice flow. very very enjoyable. Reccomended!"
5,Emmylou Meets Dire Straights???,"I've always like these two performers, and it was great that they collaborated on this effort. One critic mentioned that the CD had no particularly outstanding tracks. Well, no one song jumped out in my face. If I want ""in my face"" music, I've got everything Metallica for that. Actually, I'm sure that was a simple referral to having no single song standing out as better than all the others. That's okay with me. This is a very good, sweet and consistent set of music featuring two excellent singers. I noticed that ""Rollin' On"" reminded me of Emmylou's ""All My Tears"" on her Wrecking Ball album. Of course, Mark's unique guitar work bore strong resemblance to his Dire Straits days (I have all that, too). I was far from disappointed and will be listening to this CD many times in the future."
5,Great Harmony,"The harmony of Knopfler and Harris is tight and beautiful to hear. Just sit back and listen to all the music - read or sing along with the lyrics and absorb the sounds and feelings. Emmy Lou's voice is a wonder to those of us who ""practice the art of harmony"". The Amazon reviewer said she felt the CD flat - but I found it to be uplifting throughout."
5,Best since Wrecking Ball,"I had never heard of Mark Knopfler, but this CD does not disappoint. I haven't fallen in love with any of Emmylou Harris' CD's since Wrecking Ball, but this one is just as good, if not better. Knopfler's voice complements Emmylou's well."
5,ALL THE ROADRUNNING,I am very pleased with the product I received and will continue to do more in the future.
5,All the Road Running Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris CD,"The CD arrived in excellent condition with nary a defect and with pefect timing! It arrived in plenty of time to gift a dear, 47th birthday celebrating friend who is a fan of both of these exceptional artists."
4,Lovely Duets,"This is a nearly perfect collection of songs. Each cut id elegant and spare, with Harris' and Knopfler's wonderful voices supported by tasteful arrangements. It is a wonderful ""driving late at night and thinking"" CD. My only criticism: I would have liked a cut or two that pushed the tempo and their voices a bit. The cuts all have a similar sound and feel and tend to blend and (I think) lose some of their power. That being said, it is a lovely piece of work that will have broad, cross-market appeal."
5,A great time with two fantastic artists,"I just had to get my in 5 star rating. 'This is us' and 'Red Staggerwing' are worth the price of admission on this country tinged cd.I can't call it a true country release but country music influences flow through each of the tracks. So those of you who want to hear some flawless harmonies and excellent music don't have to be scared away if you're not a country fan. Remember, Emmylou spent time recording with Dylan and others in the world or rock. And we all know how great Mark Knopfler can be. I'm just hoping we get more from this team."
2,Another New Adventure for the in-group only,"This may be the epitome of the sort of New Adventure book that New Adventure haters hate, with references that can only be understood by reading other New Adventures, all-too-clever fannish inside jokes, and a violent, angst-ridden Ace who bears no resemblance to the basically cheerful soul from the television series. It's a far cry from the same author's Revelation, which is one of the few New Adventures I've found worthwhile.Like Kate Orman's book, this does nothing to make me reconsider my decision to stop reading the New Adventures."
5,attractive blinds,"I've had these blinds in my bathroom for about a year now and have been very happy with them. The slats are each unique so it gives the room a little bit of a rustic look. They do filter light, but do not block out all the light. They also do not completely conceal shapes, so probably not the best for a bathroom or bedroom without a liner. However, I have been very happy with how they hold up to being raised and lowered regularly and how the color has stayed true. They were very easy to install."
3,Payne-era Asia continues their evolution,"""Aria"" is a solid effort from Payne/Downes and co. You can really tell with this collection of songs that they were developing and maturing their sound which would find its zenith in their magnum opus, ""Aura"". It may not be quite up there with ""Arena"" or ""Aura"", but still has a lot to recommend it. Pretty good from start to finish. It's definitely superior to ""Silent Nation"", their final album. For the true Asia fan, ""Aria"" will not disappoint."
2,Asia goes hair metal,"I wanted to like this album, but I just can't get into it. While it is a more consistent album than its predecessor Aqua, it is the least Asia-like album in their catalog. Unlike Aqua, which had a nice balance of keyboards and guitars, Aria has the guitars up front and the keys in the background. The combined effect is to sound like the 80s version of Deep Purple at best, or yet another hair metal band at worst. That's a shame, because Asia is not a hair metal band. To be fair, three of the Payne-era band's best songs are on this disc: Anytime, Feels Like Love, and Military Man. Things improved dramatically with the group's next release, Arena, so hopefully this is the low point for Asia."
5,Masterpiece,"""Aria"" is yet another magnificent album from Asia. The songs are strong, the band is amazing, John Payne sounds terrific. A little- heard masterpiece."
5,Guilty Pleasure,If you lived through the 80s and love guilty pleasures then check out what these guys were doing in the early 90s. Just an outstanding effort.
2,Very Disappointed.,"I have to agree with another reviewer, this is Asia's weak attempt at being a hair metal band. The song writing is weak and they sound like their trying be Whitesnake. From the opening track ""Anytime"" to ""Are You Big Enough?"" to the slocky ""Feels like Love"" is by far their weakest effort in their twenty year career. Don't bother."
3,"Not their best, but not a failure either","""Aria"" was never a disappointment in my opinion. Not as good as ""Aqua,"" but still a good album. It's more straight ahead than ""Aqua,"" or ""Arena."" ""Sad Situation"" is my favorite song on this album. Worth a listen."
4,90s Asia begins to find musical direction on Aria!,"The one problem with the 1992 Aqua release was that the album sounded very disjointed and fairly unfocused, jumping from progressive to AOR and back again. With 94s Aria, Downes and Payne show what Asia is becoming capable of, musically. The songwriting is stronger and the album flows much more smoothly, based more in progressive rock styles. The only major downfall is that the album feels a little dry without Steve Howe's trademark virtuoso guitar play..."
5,Lots of Fun,"My niece loves putting makeup on this doll. I didn't realize the large silver thing was an airbrush (I thought it was a hairdryer!). She never used it and never made a mess. The plastic faces are hard for her to use to tattoo, but she doesn't care. She loves using the brushes on the doll's face."
2,Bad Bratz,"My daughter begged for this toy every time it came on t.v. or we saw it in the store. The only reason I bought it was because Amazon had it for only $10. I knew it would be a dumb toy and I was right. The ""make-up"" spray didn't work and I was afraid of the mess. I threw it out with the make up and let my daughter keep the doll. She ended up disappointed in the make-up but understood why it had to go. I do not recommend this to anybody."
4,"Tamas Merei played great, but the Caprices are still better in Violin","In this disk, Tamas Merei shows the world his brilliant technique in the thoughtfully transcription on Paganini's famous 24 Caprices. The complaint I have is that not all these works sounds great in cello. It kind of reminds me the boring and discomfort when listening to some violin version of Caprices which only exhibit technique without interpretation. Tamas Merei did a great job in other cello virtuoso pieces, so he is not the guy who cannot deliver personal readings. I think the Paganini transcription is just too difficult for cello. Tamas Merei successfully conquered the technical, but that's probably all he can do. Other works like Hungarian dances are much more enjoyable and demonstrate Tamas Merei's touch as an musician. The recording sound is outstanding, a very good reference for cello lovers."
3,Not good with EA Active for the Wii,I bought these to replace the bands that came with EA Active for the Wii but these don't work very well with the controllers. However they are pretty good as just fitness bands so if thats what you need I can say they do their job.
2,Don't fall for this.,"While the idea is good, the wrench simply does not cut it when tigher grip on the nuts is needed. I got it from the Homedepot for twenty-four bucks and had to return it the very next day - I was trying to use it to install a bike rack and it kept slipping and eventually rounded the nut. I had to use a plier to get that nut off..."
1,Worthless piece of junk,"Crescent has earned as reputation for making quality tools but should be ashamed for selling such a worthless piece of junk. This tool has slipped on every nut or bolt I have ever tried to use it on. Even with light torque the jaws spread and the tool just slips off, sometimes rounding the edges. Don't be fooled by the cleaver design or the name on the tool this is nothing but a waste of money."
2,Was DOA - did not work,"I bought this at Home Depot hoping to use it on some lower end bikes that we are rebuilding. I pulled it out of the packaging, and could only get it to ratchet in one direction. Flipping the switch, it stopped ratcheting all together. I tapped in on the ground, flipped the switch back and forth, but the barrel just spins with no take-up. This will go back to Home Depot for a return."
2,"Intersesting concept, poor execution","I was tempted to try this because it looks like it might be convenient for some tasks. Unfortunately, as most other reviewers have noted, it does not get a good grip and tends to slip. Essentially useless."
2,poor quality,"Appears to be Chinese construction. Thumb screw mechanism catches at certin points, without apparent cause. Added oil and gentle touch, little or no good effect noticed. Wiggling the jaws does not help. Not convenient or a one hand tool. I'll keep my ratchet handle and socket set from the past and return this one."
5,One Tool,This is one very handy ratchet. It handles just about any size nut or bolt that is used in most around the house jobs. Great!!PS. The wife can't lose any sockets.
1,Didn't work out of the package,The second time I tried to adjust the thumb-wheel to a new nut size it stuck and won't move! I've contacted the manufacture of Crescent tools (Cooper Hand Tools) for assistance.I'll update this review when I hear from them.I returned my wrench to Cooper Tools for repair/replacement. They supposedly shipped me something in return 2 weeks ago. I guess I'm out $29.95.
5,awesome tool,This wrench is great. Mainly I use it for tightening the handle of clamps. It saves my hands from much strain and pain. The fact that it has the feature to tighten hooks and such items is fantastic. It has not slipped on a nut even when I used it to loosen the nut from my oil pan on my car. Overall WORKS GREAT. Just wish they made a bigger one.
4,Get it for the first track at least...,"I'm serious. Abstract Truth did quite a remix for ""get another plan"". Superb sounds...music that pushes you farther. Put this track in, get on the highway, and floor it! You won't be dissapointed."
4,Celex-C == a solid B+,"I have used this ever since my dermatologist recommended it. I have difficult skin; a delightful blend of acne and wrinkles, etc. I am convinced the only things that work, really work, are dermatologists...(no, I am not a dermatologist...)So, here is the bottom line -- it smells great, especially if you are a fan of cucumber scent. It washes off easily, foams lightly and generally I use it every day, so obviously I am a fan. I recognize that it isn't inexpensive, so to be clear ....I am not sure that using it results in any miracle changes to my skin. However, my husband loves the scent and says it reminds him of me...so what can I say...I'm not giving it up any time soon."
4,Cleanser rating,It seems to work and has high ratings. It removes makeup and dirt well but I just don't like its smell.
4,I like this product!,I have already reviewed this product and will keep using this product as it gives a clean feeling to your face when used every few weeks.Service is good & reliable from the seller too!
1,Garbage,"You get what you pay for -- and you won't like it. Ghosting and blurriness sufficient to cause severe eye strain. Replaced with a better quality cable, and the picture became clear and sharp."
3,"A good product, but way overpriced at Amazon","My review title says it all. I generally trust Amazon to offer fair prices, and in this case didn't notice how little of my favorite liquid soap I was getting in this $7.16 refill -- just 16 oz! A few days after its arrival I comforted myself by ordering 3 identical bottles for $2.99 each from a website from which I often get such items. That will be my source from now on, naturally."
4,"Good poems, slim volume.","Tornado Alley is the best poem in this collection of 12 poems. It is lyrical, dramatic, moving, and powerful--telling the story of a tornado busting up a small town in America on a Sunday afternoon."
5,Straight to the top shelf with my favourite albums.,"I discovered Slowreader's ""Every Part of Nothing"" on a sample CD their label Fueled by Ramen sent me when I ordered a CD of The Stereo. Needless to say I fell in love with it on the spot and did not hesitate one second before ordering the whole album.As the first one I heard, ""Every Part of Nothing"", with its moody bass line and ah-ahs, is still among my favourite, and ""Politics, Music and Drugs"" makes you want to stomp and clap along. But in my opinion, ""Anesthetic for the Amputee"" surpasses all the others with its tremendous beauty... Repeat Track.It's hard not to be full of praise for this record. It's got atmosphere. In fact, it is so addictive that if I try to come off it for a couple of days, I then catch myself humming ""Politics, Music and Drugs""'s catchy tune while hanging up the laundry or washing the dishes... as the irresistible urge to put it back in the player rises up in me again... Repeat All."
5,the genius of rory allen phillips and gabe hascall,"let me say this, slowreader is picking up right where the impossibles, before their second and final unfortunate break-up, were headed. rory and gabe really put their hearts, minds and talent into this album, and have made it more than just another piece of plastic with laser-burned music on it, they have made it an auditory landscape of self-understanding, self-loathing and damn good music. let's hear it for eleven songs, nearly forty minutes of pure pleasure and thought-provoking goodness."
4,Excellent book also for an adult,"I've just started studying Spanish and been looking for books about its vocabulary. This book is not only good about the word selected but also its beautiful figures. (I guess that all figures are made of cray.) They are excellent! Never get bored! I gave it four-star 'cause I wish each word was written with an articles. (la, le)"
5,The BEST Spanish Book Ever!,"This book is awesome! First of all, it is *beautiful*! The art work is amazing - all the illustrations are done in clay, but in a wonderful way I've never seen before. The illustrations are bright, eye catching, and very engaging.Second, the way the book is done makes it extremely versatile. On your first look through, you can read the names of all the objects pictured. In your subsequent use, you can ask your child to find the objects pictured in the margins in the picture itself. ie: ""Donde esta la mariposa?"". We use this book not only for learning Spanish, but also for sharpening observation skills [like a ""search"" book or ""I spy"" book]. And my child has to know the meaning of the word I'm using [ie: Mariposa] to know what to find in the photo - it makes the whole process extremely interesting to her and she really, really enjoys our Spanish lessons!I can't recommend this book highly enough!"
3,Get this for your child or for yourself,"My daughter just got this book for Christmas. Everyone, including the adults in the family, love it. It puts Spanish words in their context. There is even a glossary in the back that tells you how to pronounce the words. This is a fun way to learn a new language and be able to practice it on a daily basis. Living in L.A., we are always on the lookout for Spanish language books. This one stands out because it has great photos and is reader friendly."
5,Just GREAT!!!,"This is great music, great performed. We should have more composers like Hajdu in the concert hall!"
1,I wish I could give this a zero!,"Spend your money wisely and get another book. This book is poorly written in what seems to be a foreign language. The phrase ""it's Greek to me"" certainly applies here. This book contains grammatical and spelling errors alike. The coding is incomplete and as a student of C++ I find it outrageous that computer science professors require this book as a textbook. All in all do not buy, try C++ Primer Plus."
1,False Advertisement,"The item that I ordered was what I thought was in the picture, which is the old style Cadillac symbol. I received the new style Cadillac symbol which will not look correct on my 1969 and 1985 Cadillac's. I purchased three of these plates and now I have to either return them or eat the cost. Both decisions are an additional step and burden on myself."
5,Best Perfume Ever Made!,"Every time I wear this perfume I get compliments. It is more of a fruity smell than a musky smell. It's hard to explain in words, just buy it and you won't regret it!"
3,Different Approach,"Dr. Karkkainen approaches the subject of the Holy Spirit in a different way by giving an overall understanding of various views of the Spirit. It is a good book to obtain a general overview of Pneumatology, but it lacks substance in my opinion. If you want to a summary of different views on the Holy Spirit, then this will be helpful. If you want a more indepth, theological work, then this is not the book for you. One very positive element was his summary of the Greek Orthodox Church's view of the Spirit, which we in the western church tend to overlook. One area he neglects though is the Celtic Christian concept of the Spirit, which may be good to include in a revised edition some day.Dr. Danny"
4,good book,I own other texts by this author and appreciate the clarity and focus he brings to the topic through his work.
2,cheap,"it took about a half hour to unhook the thing from itself when it arrived in the mail,and now it is held together by cord and twistie ties because it breaks every time we put anything in it."
1,Not Good,"It's nice looking from a distance, but its cheaply made! The wire on the one side was messed up and you can see where somebody just wrapped the broke pieces around another piece to rig it to work! Bad craftsmanship!"
3,"Handy, but not terribly durable.","I have used this for several months now, and I primarily put bananas in it. It can hold about 15 or so bananas spread out on the three levels, but from time to time the chain links bend and the chain breaks. I have lightened the load a bit, because I don't want all my bananas to fall out and bruise!I would recommend it as a temporary or lightweight basket. However, I may reinforce it with some string woven throughout the chains. I will come back and update how that goes."
2,Flimsy,"Might be good for sponges or cotton balls. I put less than 10lb of produce in the thing and it snapped. Fixed it up, put less in it and it broke again. Flimsy, only good for super light things, wouldn't hold half a dozen small potatoes and a couple onions. I'd have given it 1 star, but they are making the return pretty easy."
4,"Good Looking, Pretty Well Made","just got this hanging basket, no problems so far. holds 3 avocados, a bunch of bananas and a dozen apples just fine. better quality than i was expecting based on previous reviews."
2,Very weak when overloaded with onions,"We bought this to use as kitchen storage and find that, when it gets loaded up, the chains open up and come apart. Ugh. Pretty and functional for light use."
1,What's really on this disk,"Nowhere could I find a list of what was on this disk. Finally I shelled out the six buck because each time I did a search for an old movie it would show on the list. This disk is a collection of 25 of the best classical music favorites (their words, not mine) accompanied by beautiful scenes of nature's creatures great and small... I am not going to list the music (from Bach to Vivaldi with Sousa thrown in)... not completely what I expected when you do a search on Stars and Strips Forever or Clifton Webb (for the movie he did) and get this..."
5,LOVED this book!!,I love the way Nora Roberts/JD Robb blended the two stories together. WONDERFUL read! .. and such an innovative idea!
5,Excellent,"I highly recommend this book! This was the second Nora Roberts book I've read, and the first J.D. Robb and I loved it. She is a gifted story teller and easily draws the reader into the story. I love the way she sets this story in the present (2003) and then takes it into the future. Hers are books you don't want to put down until you're finished, and then when you're finished you wish there was more. The characters are very real and endearing. I'm am a big fan and will definitely be reading more of her books."
5,book,"loved this book, j d robb is fantastic and her Eve and her adventures in law and life in the future are great"
4,got me interested in the in death series.,"yes,the book could be boring, and if you have not read the in death series, eve does come across strong. but, the book gives nr fans a chance to see what jd robb is writing and maybe get some new fans. the first part is classic nr. very well written. after reading the other 17 books, the second part made sense. do not be turned off by the 56 year difference. take a chance. i don't think you will be disappointed."
3,Offended,"Did anyone else find this use, of Gods name, in its various forms, to be offensive??I have read all Nora's books, but cannot ""remember when"" I have seen so much attention to Our Lord's Name. I am a great fan, but I find this new road to be very offensive. There are multitudes of writers out there that I might expect this from and was very disappointed to find that Nora is becoming one with them."
3,Disappointment Part II,"This combined storytelling of Nora Roberts and alter ego J.D. Robb was brilliant in its conception, but a little short on execution. While I enjoyed Part I very much, I was very disappointed that Part II didn't stray from the Eve Dallas formula in order to tell the story of Samantha Gannon from her POV- which I was hoping would happen. Don't get me wrong, I like the Eve Dallas novels, but after reading the story of Laine Tavish, I was really looking forward to reading a romance that involved her grand-daughter, and not the old been-there-done-that romance of Eve and Roake. Plus I figured out who the perp was in about chapter two...doesn't make for too great of a mystery. My advice - try it if you really, really can't get enough of Eve Dallas."
3,Half and half,"Loved the first half; good characters, people you got interested in ana cared about....but TOO MUCH SEX!! Second half...well, mostly boring; just kept reading to see how it would turn out. znone of the characters were especially well developed or appealing. And, had to skip over the sex parts. I like Nora Roberts; this the first I have read by her alter ego and doubt if I will read any more."
4,The marriage of 2 individual books never worked so well!,"Two completely individual yet connected novels in one action packed book that combines both of the authors personalities.Hot Rocks:What if your father was Big Jack O'Hara - thief, scam artist, grifter?Laine chose to change her name and move to a small town where no one knew her. Things were going good for her, too, until her her father's friend manages to get himself killed right out in front of her antique shop. His last cryptic words to her being 'Hide the pooch'.Big Jack:Upon returning home from her two-week book tour all Shannon can think of is putting her feet up but instead she finds her house-sitter with her throat slashed and winds up with a hotel mixed with interviews with Eve and Peabody. All due to some rocks her grandfather stole."
2,Not Worth Buying,"The first part was okay, it's got romance, sex, suspense, just everything it needs. But when part 2 came, it was as boring as hell. Yes it shows a little affection between the hero and heroine. But over-all I didn't really like this Nora Roberts book, and I feel that I wasted money on this book. To be honest, I bought this book because of the name. Nora Roberts always manages to surprise me, but over-all I really DID NOT like this book. It was a waste of my time. The first part was good, I mean, everything was planned out set out, it was out there. But when the second part came I wanted to throw the book away. I read all the way till Chapter 25 and it just bored me to hell. I said, ""Forget it, never mind I'm not going to read this.""SO overall in my opinion this is not worth it. If you want real Nora Roberts, Read BirthRight, Carnal Innocence, Donovan Series, and Midnight Bayou."
3,two time zones is difficult,This is the first time I've read anything written as Nora Roberts. I loved the characters she developed in the novel but then switching to the JD Robb style was not an easy transition for me even though I love that series.
3,Fans and devotees.,"This is a very low key documentary.It has its pleasures for the die hard Pynchon fans (I'm one.).You get to see some hardcore Pynchon devotees and that is alternatly funny, interesting and creepy.There are no great insights into the literature though, so back to the books."
1,Richard Lane is a moron,"Do not buy this piece of crap. Lane is a pompous *ss. He gets things wrong, for instance, misdating the marriage of Richard Farina and Mimi Baez, and justifies making up stuff with the argument that Pynchon doesn't discuss himself so we can say anything we want. Save your money; I wish I had saved mine. I guess Irvin Corey's acceptance speech was worth hearing, though not worth [...]."
2,Pride and the Adventure of Youth,"I gotta tell you... the book is a good story full of fun readings and adventures, but it's also chock full of bragging. Excessive bragging. Bragging of the skill of the Scout, of how the Scout is above others in all ways, of how the Scout has, can and should utilize their skills to exact psychological warfare on others. I just kept thinking to myself as I read it that it was like a teenager, bragging about how he was better than others, and demonstrating that with amusing tales. It's like an adrenaline rush for Tom... and I quote, ""With each passing moment, the excitement within me grew more intense (pg 127)."" It's about his search for thrill, not a helpful guide to developing any sort of Scout skills for ourselves. Alas. I suppose we'll have to attend his classes for that. ;)"
1,Ridiculous super-ninja wannabe fantasies -- don't waste your money,"This book is fiction, even though it is not listed as such. Boring, unrealistic, childish fiction.Tom Brown's over-the-top lies get more and more ridiculous with each chapter, as he tries progressively harder with each of his tales, to try to make himself look like some sort of superhero. Anybody who has spent any time out in the woods, and doesn't spend all of their time watching Rambo will immediately see through these childish stories ... Tom Brown is a complete fool: don't make this fake richer by spending your money on his trashy fiction novels.If you actually want to learn about tracking -- I'd recommend the following books:""Tracking and The Art of Seeing"" by Paul Rezendes""Mammal Tracks And Sign"" by Mark Elbroch""Tracking: Signs of Man, Signs of Hope"" by David DiazThese are three of the most high quality tracking books you'll find, and you won't feel like you've been scammed after receiving them."
5,great book,"this is a great book!!! probably the best of all the tom brown books. 'the way of the scout' reminded me of my younger days of running around in the woods. many times, i evaded people and slipped through places unseen. many times, i had been right under caretaker's, security, and law enforcement's noses and came close to being caught. this book is similar to those kind of things i did, although, i never took things as far or as hardcore like tom and rick did with stalking wolf! great stories in this one and definitely worth reading over and over again. the way of the scout is definitely a way of life that fits me!"
1,this book should be listed in the FICTION section,"there are many good stories with lots of adventure which makes it interesting to read. unless tom brown can show proof of what he claims in this book, it should be listed in the fiction section. if other people went and and tried to copy cat what tom brown claims to have done, they would get arrested or possibly killed."
4,i liked it.,"It's definitely different. There are a few that I skip, but there are some great ones too. It's an interesting experiment in music."
2,only a couple good ones,"I bought this for Sebastian Bach's songs only. Really only 3 songs on this whole CD that are worth the listen. But since it's hard to find otherwise, you should probably go ahead and get it if you must have them all!"
1,THIS IS WORSE THAN HARD TIME!,"This just is not a decent effort, I can say there is 3 out of 7 songs you could listen to, the rest is drivel. The interviews are just wasted attempts to fill a cd, intensely mindless and not even serious or funny! No real sound or production. Definetly no rock, ..."
5,Excellent Value for the money,"There isn't anything bad you can write about this book. The advice is solid, there are many action plans and check lists as well as example of businesses which have implemented the various plans. It touches many aspects of marketing and is a great book to help the average small business move more products and services. It would still be a bargain at twice the price."
3,Angie deserves credit,"The difference between this book and ""Backstage Passes"" is that ""Free Spirit"" is the ""I Still Love You, David"" report whereas BP is the ""sour grapes"" account. I do believe Angie had been treated unfairly both by David and some of his fans. Of course the talent is David's and will always be, but Angie was there for him through hard times. Incidentally, my favorite Bowie albums are the ones he recorded while Angie was his wife. If you're a Bowie fan, do hear Angie's side of the story. You won't be disappointed."
5,Finney is one of the best storytellers around,"I've read everything that Finney has written and this is one of his best. He makes you really care about these people. They are rather ordinary people going about their lives, but all the story lines are engaging and interesting. I stayed up all night with this book."
1,Banter,"I think the first reviewer got this right. its a budget cd that doesnt fill the disc at all, put out by the record company. these songs are the singles, which happen to be more ballad like than rock ones that most of their songs are. if you are a toto fan seriously look elsewhere (isolation, hydra, seventh one). if you are a new toto fan, also look elsewhere, unless you are like a top 40 party dj or something wanting the 'singles' theres seriously more to toto."
4,"good value, good music","This is not the most complete Toto collection you can buy, or the best, but it tends to be the least expensive, and gives a good retrospective of Toto's most popular years as a group. Largely forgotten gems like ""99"" and ""Georgy Porgy"" (check out special guest vocalist Cheryl Lynn [""Got To Be Real""] on the chorus) show that there was more here than just ""Rosanna"" and ""Africa.""Serious fans will want more Toto than this collection offers, and should also check out some of their excellent contemporary work. But casual fans will get more than enough of this great group from ""Super Hits"""
4,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,"Stevie, Carole, and Lisa are ready and excited for the upcoming gymkhana, a three-day event full of relays and games and fun - all on horseback, of course. The girls need a fourth team member, and surprisingly, Stevie's brother, Chad, fills in. Chad is not the most experienced rider, but he's entertaining, and they soon discover that he has a crush on one of them.Carole also meets Kate Devine, a championship rider who is introduced in this book and later becomes a main character in the series. The girls think Kate would be the perfect fourth member to the Saddle Club, but unfortunately Kate has sworn off riding ever again.HORSE POWER is the fourth book in THE SADDLE CLUB series, and it continues to be relatable and fun for the intended age group. With each book, readers get more and more attached to Stevie, Carole, and Lisa, while also being introduced to new characters, so it's a good thing the series is so long!Reviewed by: Andie Z."
4,horse power,"The Saddle Club is busy preparing for the upcoming gymkhana, in which they will play horse games and compete against other teams for a prize. The girls discover that Kate, Carole's new friend, was once a championship rider, but gave it up due to no longer enjoying competition. Can they persuade her to join their team and recapture the joy of horses?"
5,I like it very much,"The second album of the band. My favourite song so far is ""summer days"" partly because it's english and the lyrics is very cool and not to mention the music too. It rocks. The orchestra version of Yesterday & Today wasn't very good. I meant there's lots of rooms for improvement."
5,"It's fantastic...buy it, buy it!","Ok, I've gotta say that this single is awesome. It's not my personal fave, but the bonus track is pretty cool! You can really hear Mel C and Emma in the background, especially. Listen carefully! ooh, ya better buy it first..."
5,Really interesting read,I read this book because it was assigned to me by one of my teachers so I had a slow start but I have never enjoyed an assigned book so much!! I couldn't put this book down and I'm sad that it has endedI recommend this book to anyone it's relatable on all levels of ages and situations !!Props to Mr.Rai for this awesome book!!
5,"thank you, free design!","Oh well, this record is simply gorgeooooous. I loved the original sixties recordings by the Free Design, and this brandnew album features all their classic trademarks: stunning vocal harmonies, unusual & unique songwriting, great thoughtful lyrics and truly mindblowing arrangements. A favourite track on this album is the great ""Springtime"", already a classic song in its own right (if you ask me). Think of Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks trying to write a hit single - and then SUCCEED. In a better universe this would be a smash hit. This album is a treat for each fan of classic, well arranged pop music in a Beach Boys/Harpers Bizarre vein. Beautiful albums like this are so rare, don't hesitate to buy it. This is really worth all your cash!"
2,"O Brother Bruce, Where Art Thou?","There are two stellar tracks on this: ""McCarran Airport,"" sounding like a lost Jimmy Webb classic, and the wistfully gorgeous ""Spring Time."" A quick look at the credits show they're the only two from the pen of brother Bruce. As for the rest -- think Kenny G meets H/D/H. Sadly, that stands for Hallmark/Doggerel/Hallmark. And that's too bad, as the vocals and sparse arrangements are right on the money. If there's to be a follow-up, give Bruce free reign."
5,Demand This CD!,"This album is ,as they say, ""OFF THE HOOK"" ! I really enjoyed they way the fuse reggae/dance-hall rhythms and hip-hop beats together to come with a unique sound. This CD is not only good to listen to , but completely danceable. I enjoy this group in more ways than you can imagine, I have had the opportunity to see them perform live and in living color. The groups performances are energetic and fun, they want to involve the audience as much as possible, and they do. The positive message they put across is necessary these days, With all the trifling messages that are put across in music we need something that will lift our souls. Not only is the Massive message positive but the group is too. I had the opportunity to meet them and get to know them...i can honestly say they are a genuine group of young men! GO GET THIS CD...GO SEE THE SHOWS...I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. one love"
4,Nice clear DVD player,"I gave this DVD player to my daughter for Christmas last year and the player still runs great. It is very clear to watch it and it's easy for her to use. I did notice that it freezes sometimes when you try to load a DVD after it has been used for quite a while (it's hot.) I just unplug it, wait 5 seconds and plug it back in and it works fine again. Also, the DVD's get loaded on the top, so it needs plenty of ""head"" room so the lid can open. Those 2 reasons is why I give it 4 stars and not 5."
3,Freedom (Angel Air) self-titled import CD,"For those of you that are unfamiliar with the band,they were a decently talented UK progressive band that existed from 1967-72.Included two former members of Procol Harum which were drummer Bobby Harrison and guitarist Ray Royer.Soon,Royer left and was replaced by Roger Saunders.The trio was then rounded out with bassist Walter Monagham.This self-titled lp was originally released in 1970.Most promising cuts are ""Nobody"",""In Search Of Something"" and the band's namsake ""Freedom""(perhaps the CD's best track).Noticed that ""Frustrated Woman"" sounds like a reworking of the Standell's ""Dirty Water"".Some nice tight harmony vocals here from all THREE members.Should appeal to fans of Cream,Traffic and maybe some fans of Zeppelin and Sabbath."
4,"It t'was good the first time I heard it in the early 70s, and, still good listening last week (12/2012)","The title says it all, its been forty years since I heard it on 12 inch lp, on CD it just enhances the sound. This is pre metal and pre shred, jout good old rock."
4,Entertaining,"For light reading, it's hard to beat Dick Francis. I've read lots of his books and this is one of the best."
5,the Brat Pack,A must own for any comic/super hero fan! Easily in my top 10 greatest stories. Rick Veitch's take on the super hero genre is phenomenal!
3,Not as good as I remembered,"The material added to the collected edittion that did not appear in the miniseries is a bad fit, jarring to the reader. Would have been better without."
3,Ehhhh,"Not at all what I expected from Rick Veitch; no new insights into the hero/sidekick relationship. In fact, pretty much is what I would expect from the myriad of lesser lights that flood the graphic novel market every year."
2,A one track wonder,"I'm an avid Grant Green fan, with 7 of his albums already in my collection. This is a weak CD and only two tracks caught my ears. ""Ain't it funky now"" is a standard jazz-funk number driven by Idris Muhammed's peerless drumming, however his version of Lennon/McCartneys ""A day in the life"" is something altogether better.After an unpromising start in which Green states the theme a couple of times, the band soars off into the most uplifting improvisation, starting with Green and ending with an excellent saxophone solo, buoyed up by some rare rythym playing.Is it worth the money? Well, there are better Grant Green CDs in Amazon's catalogue, but for die-hard Grant Green fans and guitarists hunting novel licks, this might be worth buying."
2,lab rat reporting for duty--after the sugar high,"they can hide the candy in the yogurt pretendo health food, but this is WAY TOO SWEET. I am sugarholic and this stuff was too sweet for me after just four five. Not much flavour. Just...sweet.pass......"
3,"Sort of tasty, but don't mistake it for a healthy alternative. It is candy.","This candy tastes ok with an interesting mouth feel. However, I don't think I am the target market. They are quite small. My granddaughter ate some of them, but wasn't wild about them. They don't make any claims for this to be a healthy snack, but the use of ""yogurty"" and showing a big strawberry on the package seems to want you to think it is a healthy choice. In fact, it is merely sugar with various flavorings. The closest it gets to fruit is apple puree. And instead of yogurt you get yogurt cultures. OK.If you like them, enjoy them. I don't think I'll be looking them up again for myelf."
5,Still beats me.,"Too long ago to ID the CD. Here are eighteen more words: more words, more words, more words, more words, more words. How's that for creativity?"
3,best of the lot,"a good book, the greatest by howard's ""successors"". great opening. good battle descriptions. but there were also moments where nothimg much happened, and some things didn't feel so natural. but a good book, mind you."
4,Too bad Wagner's not still with us.,"This is easily the best non-Howard Conan book. It doesn't fully capture Howard's style and characterization but comes much closer than any other book. If Wagner were still around, he might be able to write other novels in this vein. He was far better than the vile L Sprague de Camp certainly."
4,A Good Adventure.,"Necromancers and barbarians don't mix. That's what I have figured out in Karl Edward Wagner's Conan - The Road Of Kings.This novel was a nice light read. I have only read a couple of Conan novels not by Robert E. Howard, and so far this one has been one of the best.Conan is about to get executed at the beginning of the story where he is rescued by a band of rogues. The rogues turn out to be a secret rebellion against the kingdom they are in. Conan gets caught up in all the battles and politics. There is no lacking in action in this novel."
3,"Better than nothing, but ...","This trap will attract and catch coddling moths. However, it has a tendency to collapse and stick to itself at the bottom. This makes it difficult, though not impossible, to correctly count moths. I used it this year and had to pry the sides apart each time I counted moth catches.I have used Trécé brand coddling moth traps and never had this difficulty. Next year I'm going back to that brand. It's a bit harder to find on the internet, but much easier to use."
1,Not as friendly as you might think,"We had a sweet pair of Chikadees making a nest in our bird house. We noticed that they were no longer around and thought they moved on. Weeks later, (today), we looked at our codling moth trap high in our apple tree (per manfuacturer recommendations), it didn't seem right. My husband climbed up and found that one of the sweet birds has gotten caught in the trap! I'm feeling very guilty and sad about this, and now wish I had smiply chosen a bug spray instead of traps. I had no idea that this could ever have happened.I won't ever use a trap or tanglefoot in one of my trees again. If there is room for a bird or honeybee to get inside, they are trapped just as much as any moth could be."
4,Compendious,"This really has it all. Don't try to run a science fiction or genre-mixing game without it. The only thing weak here is that some of the new rules are a bit unweildy and are probably best ignored or replaced. But that's more a reflection of the weaknesses in the underlying design of the Rolemaster combat system (like all systems, it's good at some things at the expense of not being so good at others) than it is a reflection of the content of this book itself. Its reach simply exceeds its grasp at times. But face it, it's not the rules you need from Blaster Law, it's the charts. Mmmmmm, charts..."
1,Poorly designed latch housing,"Greetings, I purchased a RS-06051 two months ago and mounted it on the swivel they provided. The Housing is built in two large pieces that are screwed together. The seam of the housing runs through the mounting holes that supports ALL the weight of the housing and the hose. Bad idea! The slip mounting bracket goes into the holes of the housing. Over a very short period of time the soft plastic bends and the seam separates. This happens because the stress of pulling the hose from the housing and rewinding is all concentrated on the seam that has no screws to strengthen it.. I am an engineer by trade and this was not designed properly. If you bought one, it can be fixed with a couple of screws and a small piece of metal."
1,Hydro-Indusries warranty sucks!!,"Shortly after I bought the Compact 60 the winder started hanging up on the left. When I called their office, they assured me a part would arrive shortly. Well, it's almost a year later, and they will not stand behind their reel. They ALWAYS tell me the part or a new reel will be sent, but always have an excuse why I never received it - they lost the complaint, they moved offices, please send my receipt, please send it again - they lost it, and today, their message says that the message box is full - & GOOD BYE!! Their warranty SUCKS!!!"
2,What is Customer Service?,"I purchased the Reel Smart hose winder, model 06051 and it didn't come with the swivel mount. After several frustrating calls to the company, I've just about given up. They suck at customer service. I'm going to return it to Amazon. It just isn't worth the aggravation."
1,Not what I'd hoped for...,"Attempts to redesign a kitchen with floorplan 3d were pretty unsuccessful. The program lacks an intuitive interface, and I spent a lot of time fighting the controls. To make matters worse, often I simply couldn't do things because the program had limited options- for example, when I tried to ""place"" windows and cabinets in a design, my efforts were blocked by a program that only really imagines standard sized cabinets, and a very limited number of standard sized windows.Visualizing ""results"" was dubious at best. In the end, I drew plans up by hand. It was a bit like buying a word processor program, and finding it so awful that you go back to writing with pen and paper. Pretty disappointing."
1,Misleading information on the box,I have purchased the FloorPlan 3D version. It states on the box that it provides 1000 eitable floor plans in the soft ware. There are no instructions in the User guide to find these. The text support to speak to a person cost $9.95 per call. That is not mentioned on the box. On the box it states that there is a 30 day Money back guarentee. It does not state that it is a limited warranty for defective disks only.I will be attempting to return this were I purchased it. Don't buy!
4,Not as good as Part I,"Anemic sequel to the earlier and superior MAGIC OR NOT? The same children reappear, Kip, Lydia, Laura, Gordy in an upscale suburban neighborhood something like Scarsdale, NY or Greenwich, CT. Children love this book with its search for magical wishing wells, as well as trying to figure out Eager's clever puzzle--are the things that happen to them the result of their wishes, or is it all just a coincidence? Adults will like the spectacle of the different John Cheever-ish neighbors being lampooned in a variety of smirky ways. One added bonus is that, his character Madame Salvatini, the retired opera singer, reminisces of the days when she was young and she was just ""plain Maggie Smith."" This book was written well before Maggie Smith became an international star. ""No one gave a hoot about me when I was plain Maggie Smith; but they drank champagne out of Madame Salvatini's slipper!"""
2,Doesn't care about it,It's an okay toy overall. It doesn't make noise and the mirror is tiny on it. He will not put this toy in his mouth even though he is teething. My child likes Freddie the firefly Lamaze toy a LOT MORE.
5,Another great book from Greg Tang!,"Greg Tang encourages his audience to develop number sense in a lively way. With the help of this and his other books, you can encourage your students to develop a more fluid approach to math. I have used many of his books in my classroom, and find it is best to pre-teach his way of combining number sets before reading the book aloud (just a short lesson).After introducing several of his books last September, I spent the rest of the year listening to students' spontaneous explanations of how 13 is really just two sixes and one more, or 5 + 8 which is really 5 + (5 + 3), but it's easier to see it as (5 + 5) + 3, and so on. When kids catch on to what he is doing with numbers, it is hard to get them to stop...but why would you want to?"
5,westside connection is back throw it up,I'm feeling number 1 worth bumping could be a little harder but it's cool my fave on here and the rest of the cd's not bad either.
1,"yes, bulls%@t","I bought the one with the ""parental advisory"", but it's still censored so bad that it's not worth listening to, much less paying for.Stay away."
3,Some missin' & Song Title,There're some good songs missing on that OST but anyway it's kind of cool.The song which was played right after 'family affair' on the party (which is also not on the cd) is called 'i taste just like candy' performed by foxy brown feat. kelis. i think that was the song you're lookin' for.
1,just asking,Hey does anybody know that song that played when elroy and pinky were fighting over the girls. Its not on the cd. Help me out
3,whats that song called?,"Does anyone know what that song is called, the one that was play'n when Day Day was talking about pimp'n out of the barbecue shop? Sounds like Ras Kass but i'm not sure. Can anyone help me out?"
3,song name,"does anyone know that name of the song that was playing in the backround of the apartment when Craig left to go get his dad from Miss Pearlies apartment, it is not on the soundtrack"
3,Help with song,"Just a quick question? At the end of the movie whats the name of the song that starts off talking about having Nintendo, and Genesis and so on?"
2,cd review,i think the cd sucks cause i bought it and it has the advisory sticker on it but when i play it it beeps the words out if anyone can help me get some tracks that does not beep out and can send it to me thanks
3,bulls%*t,sounds like a bangin cd. the westside connection song is tight and so is the nappy roots track. But why in christ's holy name is it all edited? I even got the one with the parental advisory warning and still. kinda ruined the moment cuz alot of dirty lyrics on here ya know.
2,FRIDAY AFTER NEXT Soundtrack Review!,"""Friday After Next"" is easily the weakest of the ""Friday"" films and it has easily the weakest soundtrack as well. Most of the songs on the album did not even appear in the movie and most of the songs played in the movie aren't on the soundtrack. The holiday-themed Westside Connection track, ""It's The Holidaze"" is pretty good though the horrid editing ruins its replay value. Ditto can be said for the excellent G-Unit track, ""Bad News"".What could have been a potentionally good album is ruined by a company foul-up. Even the albums listed as having ""explicit content"" have been edited. The people at Hollywood Records did a real poor job in putting this whole thing together. After the two excellent soundtracks that accompained the previous films, this one was a massive letdown."
3,Wow this is a letdown,"This is a great CD, if only the cd didnt have edited lyrics. Even on the Explicit version!(PS- That song is called something close to ""Santa Claus goes straight to the ghetto""Does anyone know that Christmas song that plays when Money Mike yells ""Theres gonna be ball juice everywhere!"""
4,Beautiful book,"It is a beautiful compendium of the author's world, with great info on the characters and amazing illustration. My only knock on it is that Brooks has published several Shannara works after this was released, so it is somewhat obsolete now."
3,Poor illustrations,"For a compendium book, I expected much better illustrations, but sadly, the illustrator is not up to the task.It just does not compare to the quality of the Darrell K Sweet and Brothers Hildebrandt illustrations that was in the first Shannara series or the Keith Parkinson illustrations in the Scion series.Worst still, the new illustrations bears no resemblance to the old illustrations. I know some creative licenses is allowed, but come on, the characters in this book looks totally different from the old illustrations."
1,Disappointing,"My daughter bought this book for me as she knows that Terry Brooks is my favorite author. It is misleading to have Terry Brooks' name in large letters on a book he didn't write! I don't think this is worth the money, not even half."
2,ehh......poor illustrations,"The book, text itself wasn't all that bad though i thought the illustrations just slaughtered the world of Shannara. There were way to many of the illustrations the like that adorn the newly printed Shannara books. They look like a cheap 1970s computer graphics, just horrible. The real illustrations also were'nt exactly qaulity work either. The info wasn't too bad (which is why I'm giving it two stars and not just one). Shame on Mr. Brooks for picking that particular artist."
2,NOT UP TO IT,"This book is nice, but only that. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone foreign to the Shannara world, and would give a word of caution to those familiar with it. It is but a third-person's view about the Shannara World, I barely enjoyed reading it, it made me remember all the things I like in the books, but many of these memories where triggered by disagreements with the author.I mainly bought it looking for spectacular art, and if there's something this book lacks is art of any kind, the illustrations are scarce and very dull, you don't see any of the passion or detail that you see in the original book covers.In short, take a look at the book before buying it."
5,An extremely readable hands-on book,"A good introduction to the theory of generating functions and their uses. In fact, the only readable introduction I could find. It is NOT one of those many generation functions books written by mathematicians for mathematicians.Shows lots and lots of neat tricks that become available for a ""generatingfunctionologist"" in the fields of combinatorics and probability.All the material is presented in a very clean, organized way, with good examples. I use it as a hands-on reference book."
5,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"Look out all you Egyptians and Romans because here comes Asterix and Obelix. When Caeser thinks the Egyptions are a primitive people and only good under semi-slavery, Cleopatra sets out to prove he is wrong. Asterix and Obelix come to help and surprises are at every corner. This is the best and funniest Asterix book yet as the two struggle to help build a temple with the druid Getafix."
5,My favorite Spice Girls single,This was my favorite single from the Spice Girls. Stop was just a great song to sing along and dance too. Everyone knows the dance moves to this song. It's a shame that it never made it to #1. It was the only single they released that never made it to #1. It peaked at the #2 chart position
3,Not what I thought,When I ordered this for $20 I thought I was getting a teddy bear-sized doll of FDR. It's not. It's a 3 inch figure. Overpriced and hard to appreciate at that size.
4,A very informative book,"Charles Dunn gives a very detailed book on the traditional way of life of Tokugawa Japan. From the lowly peasant to the nobles Mr. Dunn extensively explains what they did, why they did, & how they did everything. For the casual reader this book might be a little too detailed; but for the historical interested - it is a must. I have yet to find the kind of information that Charles Dunn presents in this book anywhere else."
2,Too little for too much,"The quality of this video and the efforts made to produce it do not warrant the price of it. One is used to better historical presentations of ancient Rome from the History channel and other television presentations. I should have previewed the item before purchasing it, and I would recommend that others do the same. Save your money."
1,SciFi watcher from birth,"There has to be some smidgen of believability even in the most outrageous SciFi. I didn't believe it for one minute as at all possible. I believed it even less the next minute. This is for the youngest minds only; mere kid-stuff SciFi. After all, this premise has been done to death, and usually with poor results. The characters were nothing and the kid-appeal was gearing up to superhero kids outdoing their parents/elders. I just could not watch to see this same tired old act come to fruition. I suppose we might expect some help from one of he aliens who feels sorry for the earthlings, etc, etc, & the usual etc. I won't be watching any more of this."
2,Really bad,"Cheesy, dialogue is unreal, characters one-dimensional stereotypes. Best part is the aliens. Maybe they'll win and rid the world of those horrible people."
4,"A bit to much battle for me, but darn good otherwise","I am a bit sci-fi buff and love post-apocalyptic tales, so this was a natural for me. The characters are well-drawn and the relationships are important to the story -- again, features that appeal to me. There is a bit too much emphasis on battles for my taste, but I did watch every episode and await season three with every intention of viewing! So -- if you like your sf with family and relationship at the center, an engrossing story, good production values, and a strong cast -- this could be for you."
3,Good TV Fare,No Battlestar Galactica (new series) but enjoyable and entertaining family based SCI-FI. Characters are likeable but no stand outs. All that said defienitely worth a watch.
3,Falling Skies,enjoyed the program very much but think there ia another season that IS NOT available. Picture was not very good on Prime.
4,"greta show , streaming quality just so so","Great show, can't wait for season 2, streaming quality could be better, looks very good but not as smooth flowing during fast motion."
4,Not the best Sci-Fi but I'm hooked - BD Disc Issue Maybe,I'm writing this just as a FYI. I received this and played the first episode and it was choppy. Well I have a Samsung 3D Player and 24p Mode was set to auto. For whatever reason since the show was made for TV perhaps it was shot @ 29.97/30 but the BD Player thought it would play it at 24p which pretty much makes it un watchable. Turning that off for this disc fixes it. :)
1,Series that aims to please everybody and instead pleases nobody,"This is a show that aims to please everyone but instead pleases nobody.Do you like military type action? The lack of accuracy and absurd dialogue will make you cringe.Do you like sci-fi? The deus ex machina and lack of any explanation for the aliens, will make you shake your head.Do you like drama? The obvious and poor attempts at setting up dichotomies that never really boil over will have you pulling your hair out!Do you like romance? the awful attempts at angsty teen relationship drama will make you want run out and castrate yourself with the nearest rusty gardening tool.On top of this there are many many other reasons to hate this shows, obvious product placement in the OPENING EPISODE. Terrible dialogue, token and insulting characters that seem to be filling up a stereotype quota.TL;DR don't watch this show, you'll be worse off for it."
1,"Contrived conflict and melodrama among the ""survivalists""...","If you want to see bickering, arguing, whining, flirting, yelling and endless discussions between cardboard cutout two dimensional characters, this is your show. If you want a story about an alien takeover of Earth, then you're out of luck. 99% filler and 1% meat."
3,How stupid can the survivors be,"The survivors in this TV series rival the ""Lost"" survivors in stupidity. I'm not sure whether stupid characters are just an easy way for writers to evolve plot or what.In this episode, the survivors we have been following for the last 5 episodes give over all there children to one fella who several of them know, to be taken to a ""safe"" house before a skitter attack.I could smell a rat the first thing when I saw this guy.I won't write a spoiler, but the stupidity of this bunch just does not make any sense. How people so stupid could survive after an alien invasion just doesn't make sense.The only thing that keeps me from giving this a one star is the little bit of action in it."
2,Awful acting,"I love science fiction and that part of series meets the bar but the drama and acting is so bad, you can't bear it for more than 10 minutes."
2,Bad and boring,"The acting is poor, the special effects are B quality, the dialog is below average, and the pacing can best be compared to continental drift."
1,Chicken Little Sky is Falling,"I keep watching hoping that this show gets better, I keep watching? This show is getting worse. Each episode continues to drag the viewer around looking for some meaning. The plot has gone downhill. What's next, lesbian love scenes? Just like Stargate Universe, sex is the only way to save this series. There is no later...."
1,horrible show,this shows idea of a national guard unit is a couple of kids riding dirt bikes wielding assault rifles so there that's how unrealistic and just plain bad this show is. stay away at all costs
1,Crap!,"If there are trillions of the alien invaders who catch kids and control them, why is this kid able to color it? ""They say it hurts a lot."".............what a loon. He is another terror victim with NO signs of being truly frightened. This is America, totally desensitized and unrealistic. Get the piano out, the gentle voice of an adult. How rude."
5,EXCELLENT!,"Love this show! Human instinct survival, it's so realistic! Can't wait for Season 3 to begin, so ready to watch it now!!!"
3,"Good Sci-fi, shame about the video quality","We are currently watching this on Amazon Prime Instant video and, although the sound quality is good, the actual streaming itself is a little ropey; ""stuttering"" in almost every other scene. Hopefully this will rectify itself as we work through the season.The storyline itself is a little predictable; alien invaders, survivalists all the usual, with an interesting twist in the form of the harnesses. Hints of the invasion in War of the Worlds, and a familiar, but as yet unidentified noise made by the ""mecs"".I don't think we would have paid for this, but as it's free not a bad deal at all, and a great relief from all the usual Christmas fodder."
5,Falling skies,"I was not sure about Falling Skies, but to my surprise it is a fantastic series, the human element in the show is a breath of fresh air, not just all CGI and aliens, highly recommended."
3,Can be better,I'm trying really hard to like this show but people are getting on my nervs. Way too much talking about this and that and few actions if any. Too chatty. You'll see and next thing you'll know is you're frustrated. Could've been but nah...
4,Great series,"I watched it on TV and liked it enough to want to see the next season, bought the Blu Ray so my girlfriend could get caught up....I ended up liking it better this time. 4 instead of 5 stars because of the occasional silly Hollywood liberal writing that just makes you say ""really?"", like when the kid runs at the mech to save his dog, which could only result in his certain death... who does that stuff in real life? No one. Yes, I know there are no alien Imperial Walker things in real life, it's the concept, people. Hollywood writers come up with the dumbest things for people to do, that no one would ever do if the situation was real. This is just one example.Other than a few things like that, awesome series though. I particularly liked Tom's references to historical events and quotes. Good stuff."
2,"Great plot, Bad Acting and even worse Writing","Much like the walking dead this show started out with a clean canvas and could have taken the plot anywhere, but its a sad reality that the writing feels like it was done by a 12 year-old, it is choppy and does not always make sense. Unlike the walking dead it does not get any better. all the same bad acting / writing carries into season 2."
4,Falling Skies review,"Falling Skies is an amazing series. The setting of post-invasion lets you see the characters if Earth lost, but was still fighting. Great over-arching plot as well as great writing and characterization make this series well worth it. The cast is excellent and really comes together to flesh out their characters and their world. I can't wait for the next season to be available to see what happens next."
4,Worth while,"The acting is good and the action was too. Aliens got killed which is what I watch this stuff for.If the writers keep it up and don't fluff it down it should be a good series.Hopefully they won't cancel it like they did ""V""."
2,PLEASE!,"Labored script. Stock characters. Implausible events. Too much hugging. Far too many messages. Too easily predictable outcomes. I am not buying the Second Season,"
1,Worthless,"This is supposed to be about an alien invasion and this whole episode is about a team of 6 survivors that stumble like a bunch of retards into an ambush and get captured by a gang, and about how they FINALLY fumble around and get out of the fix.Such stupid people would no way survive 24 hours in an alien invasion.Hope they improve on this crap."
2,Falling Skies episode first half...,"Sorry to give only 2 stars. I sat thru the first hour and was struck by how homogenized and typical the screenplay and acting was. Everything was typical: crab monster aliens, walking alien 'armored' robots, things on the backs of the controlled humans. And lots and lots and lots of 'typical' banter! The alien 'city' over the city looked like a huge oil rig... real creative (sarcasm there.) I couldn't justify spending another $1.99 for the 2nd half of the two hour pilot. I'm not sure I can trust Spielberg as executive producer anymore with his sci-fi influencing (especially after the disappointing War of the Worlds). Not much else to say. I might add I am an avid sci-fi movie lover (since 1957!) and would have expected better for a 'major' series. But for those who enjoy: don't listen to me!"
5,Great for free with Prime,"This is a great series if you are into sci-fi or even if you aren't, because it is free with prime. It's one of the better ones on prime."
4,Good balance in Falling S,"Well written series with interesting characters. Always something new to keep one hooked on the next episode. Mostly plausible story line, with enough variety of character types. Keeps me watch and wondering."
4,Just a good le sci-fi,"Maybe I'm getting old, but I just want to see sci-fi without blood and gore and sex and political aganda's and this fits the bill perfectly. If you just want sci-fi, with an interesting story line (not sure how we humans will ever be able to come back from the brink) and good special affects, then check this series out."
5,Exciting and intense,We've enjoyed this fast moving action adventure. Don't know how me missed it on the line up during the regular season! Now we're hoping there's a third season
2,Too over the top,"Falling Skies is entertaining, but only at a juvenile level. It's mostly a mixed bag of too many things we've seen too many times before. Here is the recipe: take a healthy dose of smaltz, throw in some corn, pepper it with lots of hammy acting, sprinkle in a rather silly and unbelievable storyline, add an overly, melodramatic musical score for dressing, and then toss it all together in a relatively well done apocalyptic setting, and you've got a good idea of the flavor (and smell) of Falling Skies. The first couple of episodes weren't too hard to watch, but as with most of these series it kind of degenerates as it goes. Too bad! Seemed like it was an idea with a lot of potential."
2,OH!!! IT'S JUST FOR FUN....!!!,"Falling Skies: The Complete First SeasonThe advanced nort american technology falls, and a bunch of rednecks with rifles have success!!! Jesus.....oh...it's just for fun....!!!!"
4,Try it,"noah wylie shows talent beyond ER. Post invasion survival and rebellion theme has been done a lot but this one seems to be done with a little more style than the usual ""b"" movie."
3,Neat idea for using Noah Wylie,"I like this show as it gives us the thought that the world could be full of others that do not see us as wonderful. The disappointing part is the complete disregard the survivors have for doing things safely, by always being out in the open. But I do appreciate the way they study their enemies to defeat them . Overall a good show"
4,Good series - worth watching,"I had never heard of this series before seeing it on Amazon. I wasn't expecting too much, but there was nothing on TV so I gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I watched the first episode and it was good enough to keep watching and after about 2 weeks, I had watched all of season 1 and 2, and I'm eagerly awaiting season 3. I'm happy I ran into this series, it's good."
2,Falling Skies?,I already forgot what it was about. So that may tell you something. I don't have the seven more required words.
2,The most clished science fiction series of the last 20 years,"Usually i don't like alien invasion stories since there are stereotypical and unsophisticated but i was willing to give this a chance. I was vastly dissapointed. Falling skies is an amalgam af the most clished ideas in science fiction tv (since we saw them many times before). Good heroic humans fight evil aliens. Add to this the unavoidable (these days) family drama between a father and a son, the stereotypical character of a ""heroic"" commander and a totally clished aproach to human emotions and you have one of the most boring science fiction tv series of the last 20 years (at least). But ofcourse there is also Terra Nova which is even worst!"
2,This series is like a nightmare,"I do not know where to start.- fully armed civilians obeying a withdrawn para-military person??- A professor of history (an intellectual!!) who is mentally and physically capable of fighting like a well trained soldier??? His obsessive addiction for AK47 is another issue..- 16 - 17 year old teenagers armed and fighting like trained mercenaries?- many different weapons but no shortage of ammunition for each of them??- unlimited supplies of food, equipment, water, ammo and fuel???- alien robots with ""impact weapons"" firing Earth technology bullets??come on. is that the best you can do? even my eight year old son can create a plot better than that.to me, this series is a mixture of Lost and V but much worse than each of these.by the way, 2 stars is for very good acting of Will Patton and not for the series."
2,You have to be a believer,"I totally lost interest in the first, PILOT, of the series. Kept nodding off, what is all the excitement about the show? Surely not aimed at 1950's boomer generation. NOT FOR ME"
3,Could be great,This show could use more character development and less battle scenes. I feel like I'm just starting to get into characters relationships and then a battle interrupts it.
3,Weak Story,OK as far as TV series go. Special effects marginal. Acting pretty good. Character development not bad. Story is weak.
2,Lackluster,"I was hoping for something more like the new War of the Worlds or Skyline and less like the waiting room at the doctor's office. It was as though they expected us to care about characters we haven't gotten to know and thought we would really like to learn about the logistics of being a survivor when aliens attack, rather than experiencing some intense action and seeing what happened. As far as openings go, this one was poor."
1,"should be called ""Falling Asleep"" because you will if you watch this one","Had to keep switching around to keep awake. lame acting about people we never get to care about. alas. this isn't engaging at all. I was routing for the skitters, it was so bad.I love good sf. This ain't it."
2,I didnt like it,"I just didnt like it, thought it was dumb. I thought it was awfully familiar, perhaps like The Walking Dead but with aliens and I think The Walking Dead is stupid too. I used to be a big fan but after spending sometime in the Army I have grown and learned and find it hard to be entertained by shows such as this. I chuckle to myself when I see the ""experts"" in the movie talking lkke they know something but clearly they are clueless. I would not have rated this but Amazon kept sending me emails to rate this. I know I am too critical which is why I would not be watching this again. Oh it drives me insane when characters refer to rifles as ""guns"" and call magazines ""clips"" its clear they are clueless. Anyone that spends any time around weapons know a gun is something that is towed behind a truck and placed on a hill and a clip is what the ammo is packaged inside an ammo box, A clip is used to load a magazine with a speed loader"
2,So get this . . .,"The group of people who were giving humans to the skitters are captured by the survivors and let off with a warning . . . NEVER TO DO IT AGAIN.Is this total BS or what. This is more stupid than anything I've seen in the last several years of stupid TV series.Can you imagine in WWII, a group of American GI's running across a group of Germans that had been giving American prisoners to the SS who were killing them and the American GI's letting them go with a STERN WARNING. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. This is even worse than stupid. It's pathetic and an insult to the viewers intelligence.The only thing that would have made sense, especially under the circumstances that it is war, that they be executed summarily.This series goes from being passably good to pathetically stupid and insulting."
1,bad button placement,"I am using my thirty day free trail of Amazon Prime. I was attempting to press the resume button and hit the buy whole season button . The shows are O.K. but not anything I would spend 15.99 on. By the way this only happens while using my 8 inch screen tablet. Why does Amazon has 1 touch buying turned on with their streaming and mp3 pages. It would be much better with a ""are you sure"" button before you actually buy it to cut down on mistakes. Edit add on. just set parental controls on myself so accidental 1 click should not be a problem while on my tablet any more. Maybe a notice that's a little more noticeable on this quirk. I will probally continue my Amazon Prime when my free trail is done."
4,Nice Concept - Needs to Build Further,"I bought the first season on my PS3 through Amazon Instant.Very nice concept to the show for a Sci-Fi fan. The execution so far needs to bump up the action and better develop characters you truly want to be involved intellectually and emotionally with their story from show to show. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he said:As it stands, the show had a decent (if not spectacular) debut but needs to heighten the action and human drama in its sophomore year. It has a talented cast, they just need to be allowed to shine. I want to love ""Falling Skies,"" but merely like it. As a viewer, I need an urgency from the writing that makes me feel like I'm in the trenches with heroes that I really care about in a meaningful way. I just haven't gotten there yet.Same here. I said to my wife last episode pretty much the same thing. Im feeling it won't survive to a 3rd season if it does not."
5,Favorite series,"When I discovered this series, it was the middle of the second season, so I ordered the first season before watching the second season. It is so very good and my skeptical son, who borrowed it to watch, has also enjoyed it. Can't wait for the next season!"
4,Fun sci-fi show,Not much to day other than this is a fairly well done sci-fi show about an alien invasion. Pretty solid plot and CGI.
3,It's okay..,"I'm not going to go that in depth here, enough other have and its just a tv show. I found it to be interesting, I tended to want to know what would happen next. The effects are not what I thought they would be but its a step up from the usual sci-fi channel stuff. Check it out if you like sci-fi and want something new to watch."
3,"not bad, not good","If you're looking to kill time and have already watched Downton Abby, 24, Sherlock, and other good shows on here then you can give this a try. I am halfway through the 1st season and I'm not that impressed but it has kept my interest. The main character has a smirk on his face for the WHOLE movie! It took me a long time to get over that. Having him smile when there's a sad moment, or if he was getting into a heated argument. Graphics are sub-par."
5,fantastic,"Fantastic show. Hooked me quicker than walking dead has. Survival of humans seems more plausible in this post apocalyptic show, granted you gloss over the fact that the aliens didn't eliminate all humans in their initial attack."
3,It's ok,"It's ok, some bad acting in it and predictable plot, but I still enjoyed watching it. Looking forward to season 2."
5,Postapocalyptic dystopia caused by aliens that still threaten humanity? YES!,"Noah Wyle is amazing (and he's not the same character as in E.R.), and there are a host of other one-off characters played by actors you'd recognize from other shows. All around, it's a fun watch, if you're into this sort of thing. A friend of mine also described it like the future in ""Terminator"" but with aliens."
4,Good show,"Good show quality was questionable at times, but could be the internet connection. Give it a try second season is better"
4,Good show,Always kept you guessing. Look forward to seeing season 3. Aliens and most Chr are well put together and clever with holo.
3,Its OKAY,I watch it because there is not much Sci Fi available. Generally weak plots. Not much left to the imagination.
4,Great but could be awesome.,I think this is great but it could be better by fixing the sound quality and maybe adding some subtitles.
4,quirky enough,"Quirky enough to be entertaining with interesting plot line while keeping the soap drama to a minimum. Fun and Cheesy, yum."
1,Plot and Acting Subpar,"The description of the series is inviting, but when we actually watched the first couple of episodes, we were disappointed in both the acting and the storyline. We made it almost half way through the second episode before we gave up on any chance that the series would improve."
3,It's okay but you need to ignore the ridiculous,"I'm a big sci-if fan but want it to make sense. This series tries - but there are leaps of logic that simply don't make sense and the acting, to me, is often overdone. Having Wylie's character continually relate things to history becomes tired. It's as though the series creators can't decide what they want the show to be - melodrama, sci-if or comedy. I like the premise however and will continue to watch, hoping it becomes better. I would recommend watching to see if you enjoy it, but would not recommend purchasing until you're sure."
4,It ain't just about aliens vs. humans,"This show suffers from the perceptions by some folks that it is just a human vs alien action series. The best part of the show is the interaction between characters as they deal with the loss of their families and their old lives, their fear of what is yet to come, their determination not to give up, and how they live life when every day may be their last. And, oh yeah, there are also scary looking aliens, robot killing machines, captured and enslaved children, and lots of shootouts between the humans and the invaders.It's similar to The Walking Dead - which I also like - but better."
4,Very enjoyable,I watched this interspersed with episodes of Walking Dead series 2 ...which in retrospect was something of a mistake. Both are similar in type although very different in style... and I liked them both very much.I am a scifi fan anyway but this was a great story told well - can't wait for the second season!
5,Good Series,This is a good sci-fi series in the vein of The Walking Dead! The first two seasons are worth purchasing.
5,Falling Skies: The Complete First Season,I thought I had already reviewed this product. Love the TV SeriesI hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
5,Aliens vs. Humans,"The show is great, the actors are great. You feel with them all the time, an just think for your self "" what would i do""."
1,my wife watched it,I'm tired of any kind of post-invasion crap. We're already in trouble. Shows like this do not entertain me at all.
3,I appreciate the effort,"Like most males, I am a sucker for sci-fi post-apocalyptic stories. The majority of the time I am disappointed because the creative teams on these types of shows either play to the lowest-common-denominator in their audience (ie. ""Earth 2"",""Terra Nova"",""Revolution (especially terrible)"") or suffer from poor acting and/or direction...often times both.Falling Skies seems to just skim above those problems and delivers an entertaining, albeit sometimes cheesy/unbelievable story. This show is watchable but not to the same quality as shows such as ""Battlestar"" or ""Walking Dead""."
2,Moronic and cliched,"This series was clearly written with the beta version of the PlotMaster1.0 software. Take all the alien and sci fi shows you have seen, add a linear plot, and a bunch of gore and you have this show. It is not in the least intellectually engaging."
2,Disappointing,I love science fiction. I love believable stories. This series is neither one. I just cant get into it even though I have watched it several times.
5,Great Show,"I love this show, it is great. I DVR as any shows as I can watch & have missed this show. I am so happy I was able to watch it here. I highly recommend it to all and hope it has many more seasons, looking forward to season 3!"
3,"great start, then............","I stopped watching when the survival effort couldn't stop using ""magical thinking"" that assumed everybody will play fair, and everything will turn out OK if they just CARE deeply enough."
3,"Interesting overall story, bad side-stories and acting","I'm a sci-fi fan, so I was very interested in a new take on the overall ""aliens invadate, earth fights back"" story... Unfortunately, the series is full of boring side-plots that fall flat mostly due to some rather bad acting."
5,"Well thought out science fiction. Lacks the ""glam & glitter"" of modern sci-fi.","A great portrayal of a group of freedom fighters vs. aliens, hardened by battle and tempered by a lack of provisions. Not an original concept, by any means, but a well thought out, smart storyline and characters that grow from the John Q. Public type to guerilla freedom fighter to Army Ranger-style warfighter. Way to go Mr. Speilberg."
4,Compelling scifi/family show,"This is a terrific show for people like me, who are fans of ""soft"" sicfi. Although there is a lot of violence--blood of several different species--the central characters are very appealing humans who most of the time make ethical decisions when faced with difficult choices. The series was vey good in the first season, although a little predictable. The second season is much more tightly scripted and even more compelling."
5,amazing,"This was an accidental finding on my kindle but was hooked after the first 30 minutes, characters are well developed with twists and turns you don't see coming. Can't wait for season 3"
5,Wonderful family ties and beginnings.,I liked the show from the beginning but could never seem to watch much of it. Had to buy it to truly love it...can't wait for next season!
3,xxxxx xxx,"Surprised that so many hollywood actors will playact as assault weapon welding saviors of the planet from alienattack,yet they make videos bad mouthing the very guns their alter egos use. Beyond that it reminds me of theseries Jericho. Lots of gun play not enough why we fight except gotta save the teens."
3,Take off on War of the Worlds,"Very similar idea to the War of the Worlds, but with more characters. Not a very engaging story line. Pretty good special effects. I'll probably watch a few more episodes, but I'm pretty sure I won't watch the whole series."
4,"Good TV show, average PQ","Falling Skies is a good show and I was glad to see it get a bluray release.Picture quality is average (at best) for a 2011 bluray, but considering the show is literally a dark/murky show; that is to be expected.Audio is above average, with the show having a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.The only thing I can really knock is the cheap cardboard case.I'd love for the blurays to be housed in your standard plastic case. But in a world where companies are pinching pennies and worrying about their carbon offsets; like it or not, this seems to be the new standard."
5,Falling Skies - Complete Season 1,Superb sci-fic series. Another wonderful series from Steven Spielberg. Totally hooked! Now waiting for season 2----cannot wait! Highly recommended but not recommended for the very young.
5,Falling Skies Season 1,I very much enjoyed the plot and the acting. Noah Wyle is an awesome actor. I also enjoyed the cliff hanger at the end of the season.
5,Great show,I found this show by accident and once I started watching it I got hooked. Great show with good character development and acting.
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"If you're looking for science fiction, I strongly suggest avoiding this film. Don't waste your money, too much boohoo la la land drama, and virtually ""ZERO"" science, strategy, or adventure. I would not force my worst enemy.... No, on second thought, I ""would"" force my worst enemy to watch this dumbed down garbage! IMHO it seems that this series was meant to amuse the elements of society who are (for lack of a better phrase) ""a little slow""."
3,It's okay,"I have to rate this fairly average, as someone who's seen a lot of sci-fi, both good and bad. I'm given really no main character to identify with as a female. Ignoring the girl geeks is a rather serious mistake. I loved Star Trek in all its incarnations, as well as Star Wars, Babylon 5, Stargate, and Doctor Who. If the premiere is any indication of how the rest of this series will go, I'm going to have to skip it."
2,Now serving number 3 out of 2097,This is the second episode and it is still as exciting as sitting in a doctor's office waiting to have a rash looked at. There is an alien invasion going on and for some reason we are treated to the logistics of being a survivor some more and seeing people that are competing with the aliens for being the biggest pains in the rear. Where is the excitement? Where is the fear? Who knew an alien invasion could be so boring?
3,Too gooey...,"Maybe it picks up, I hope so. The first episode was very overly sentimental for a first episode. It reminds me of the original Batllestar Galactica, vs the faster paced Star Wars. They need to develop the chars before we can care too much. The way they did this just seems very cliche."
5,awesome series,I have watched this series all the way through so far. It is hands down my favorite series that I have ever seen.
4,Falling Skies,Awesome. Caught his late in season and am now doing catch up. Hope they continue like Fringe has done. Don't want a cancelled season anywhere in near future..........
5,Entertaining,Typical scifi premise of invasion by a technologically superior and destructive alien enemy of mankind and humankinds response against what seems like overwhelming odds.
3,"Good premise, but falls short","This is kind of a post-apocalyptic space invasion drama. I'm a sci-fi buff and I was prepared to like this show, but it's produced by Steven Spielberg and it is really kid oriented. Everything is tied back to kids and family - I don't think it is aimed at adults."
4,Willing To Try New Things,"- nice and sometimes quick orgasm (if placed on the clitoris)- kinda too big for first-timers- kinda difficult to put on and get into the motion- doesn't use up much battery life- the one extra bump on the clitoris-stimulation side has to go (can be painful)- is bigger than it looks- the vibration controller can get in the way but don't mess with its wires too much- its a product that grows on you, the more uses, the more you love it"
4,dimentions differ,"this product is NOT 5 x 1.5 x 1.5 .... it's 8.5"" in length and about 1.5""-2"" wide dong.The clit tickler is about 3"" wide ~2"" wide ('front' to 'back') and maybe an inch thick.The conroller is a little big and blocky... I'd suggest tucking it into the thigh strap so you don't have to hold it."
3,Very nice for the price,"we were looking for a toy to play with for some time and after going to the porn store seeing all the choices this one is the best and its about $50 less! the only thing is its not 5""....its about a foot!"
1,Waste of time and money,"This DVD is one big waste of time. It is pretty generic, and really has no value. I may as well flush $60.00 down the toilet. Thank you."
4,The Holy (Modal) Family...a Brief Explanation,"East Coast fans of the HMR (& the gentlemen from Japan) may not realize that in the 20 year hiatus when Stampfel & Weber were not performing live, they were living on opposite coasts. And the Holy Modal Rounders (sans Stampfel)--Steve Weber, David Reich, Robin Remailly, Roger North, Richard Tyler and Teddy Deane were playing at least once per weekend every night of those 20 years in Portland Oregon. The band that is known as the Clamtones is the SAME aggregation, fronted by Jeffrey Fredrick and Jill Gross, without Weber. Reich and North are still in Portland, still performing, currently with the Freak Mountain Ramblers."
2,There was only one cut that I liked,"I am not a fan of Michael Hurley. He seems like the poor man's Jimmy Buffet with slick mediocre music and mostly second rate lyrics. He did write ""The Tea Song,"" which is one of my favorites. Since he dominates this album I cannot recommend it to anyone. Weber, Stampfel, Remailly, and Resich are worthy of attention but I would recommend ""1&2"" and/or ""Too Much Fun"" instead of this disappointing collection. I wish that someone would reissue ""The Moray Eels Eat the Holy Modal Rounders."" Some of it might seem dated but I'm sure that it would play better than this stuff."
2,How do you get it to stay on your bottom teeth?,"Well, I've been using it for about 5 days now and I hate it. Last night I woke up at 2 AM and just took it off, it dries to a white, thick chunky paste that you can feel whenever you're awake. If you never wake up during the night you'd probably be fine with this. But if you do, the first thing you'll think is ""what is this thick paint on my teeth""?The biggest problem, however, is with the bottom teeth. No matter how well I dry them the gel clumps, then dislodges sometime during the night. I don't see how it can whiten my teeth if it's no longer on my teeth. Also, I don't think my teeth look any whiter. Not noticeably so at least.They should give you a prize if you can keep this up for 2 weeks.White strips are better. They're not perfect either, but at least you only have to wear them for a half hour or so a day."
1,eh,"Junk, this stuff did not work at all and felt like crap on your teeth, I think strips are the better way to go."
4,Just wish they would put out more music.,They are one of the best celtic punk bands out there...but they barely make any music. I never see them on tour. I guess this is just a side hobby of theirs.
4,Its a god damn shame they don't tour.,"There are a few jems on this cd. Sam Hall is a song that speaks to the downtrodden who in the end would love to have the guts to flip their finger to ""the man."" But the song that really got me was God Damn Shame. From beginning to end I was hooked. I wish the band would tour....and come east."
3,Overpriced research paper,"I will readily agree that this is a well written paper with a great deal of information. However, it is basically a doctoral paper rather than a true book. I expect I could find something similar in a college archive. The price is extraordinarily high for what amounts to a 70 page paper. I wouldn't buy it for more than $10."
5,I bought this for my GNX4 Guitar Work Station and it works,"I have a discontinued GNX4 work station which only supports Type I CompactFlash cards for storing memory. With this work station, I can record guitar tracks and loop them and play over them. However, one day my memory card no longer functioned and I was unable to record for the longest time. When I finally realized I could search for it on Amazon, I found this product and this one works perfectly and I can record myself playing now.I don't have any cameras which only use Type I or anything, so sorry if you were looking for a review about taking pictures and stuff, but if you're looking for a card supported by the GNX4, this one is it!"
5,Works great with Boss BR-600,Bought this after searching long and hard for a reasonably priced CF card for my Boss BR-600 (v1.1 firmware). Works great.
5,Unique find,"I was impressed to find this hard to find size compact flash card, still available and for such a good price."
5,Transcend TS,This item worked as advertised and excellent customer service. I would do business again in the future with this vendor.
4,Good price...good item,"I can't say anything negative about the card. It was what I ordered, it worked well, and a great price. Can't ask for more than that."
4,Not Compatible !,"""Industrial"" , used to be called ""pro"" , & is Not compatible with the Boss Br 600 ! & So I need to exchange it for a regular old , "" 80 X "" , Please ."
3,The color is lighter than I expected.,The color is lighter than I expected. I would choose one number darker for next purchase. The quality was acceptable.
5,Buy this now,Awesome to finally see all of these albums compiled into one box set plus some bonus tracks. I recommend going for the complete Early Rod experience and buying the following:- This box set- Faces - five guys walk into a bar...box set- Faces - A Nod is as good as a wink...- Jeff Beck - Truth & Beck Ola- Ron Wood - I've got my own album to doCan't go wrong
3,"Great music, careless remastering","As nice as it is to have all of Rod's Mercury material in one place, I have to agree with the Serbian reviewer below regarding the occasional but noticeable digital ""pops"" that mar what would otherwise be an excellent remastering job. What's the point of a remastering project if the end product contains obvious, irritating flaws like this? Looks like I'll be ripping the bonus tracks and selling this set off, hanging onto my individual remasters."
3,Disappointed,"W.a.s.p. Needs a New studio record out, and needs to lay off the greatest hits, and live albums for a while. I mean, isn't 3 live albums and two greatest hits albims enough?"
1,Time to give retirement for this free camera,". Poor video quality if used as a webcam. If used as a Digital camera, it can take decent pictures only in sunlight long distance shots.. If you got this free when you bought a Dell computer, do yourself a favour and give retirement for this camera.. If you got this free, you can also give this camera to kids as a consolation play toy, if they are asking your costly digital camera to take pictures and you don't want to give it to them :-))For webcams, I recommend Creative Labs PD1130 WebCam NX Pro ASIN: B00009V7MUFor digital camera, I recommend Canon PowerShot S400 4MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom ASIN: B00008OE6II highly discourage you to buy this!"
1,Worst. Camera. Ever.,"Got this free from Dell, it's the worst I've ever used. Comes with useless stand and lousy software, picture quality is atrocious (pixelated and dark) and video frame rate is really slow. Don't ever buy this camera."
3,AVERAGE FILM,"I was not expectin a heck of a lot from the DVD so I wasnt too dissapointed. I just thought it was a little bargain basement quality. I sold mine because my daughter didn't like it either. I try to be open minded and to let my kids decide what THEY like before i give my opinion. This was not that great. I am sure some love it but for ME, i wished i had not wasted me money on it."
4,great bass,I was very skeptical about buying this bass and it exceeded my expectations sounds great I will buy another one without hesitation. thank-you lakland
2,Just buy poptarts,"Pop tarts are way cheaper, and less messy to eat on the go, in addition the ration of filling to crust and frosting seems better to me with a pop-tart. I tried these, and will not be buying them again."
1,No Information,"Hood insulation.I am in the market for hood insulation for two 1970's automobiles.How in the World do you expect me to purchase this item when there is no;DiscriptionFiber contentSizeColorApplicationAnd, no photo?????"
3,Good product except for light bulbs,"Did some extensive updating of kitchen countertops and backsplash. As part of the project I installed this product under the upper cabinets. Since the wiring is of a standard length it didn't work for me, so extended the wiring where needed. The original bulbs have all failed now (long before their rated life) but the replacement bulbs I purchased seem to be holding up well, so I suspect it was just a bad batch of bulbs that came with the lights. The finished results look great at night and add a nice touch to all the tile work. If the bulbs had held up I would have given the product five stars."
3,Very basic but broad content.,"Very basic book. Suitable if you don't know anything about the topic and want to get very broad view about area of logistics.Pages were thick, which made it harder to handle."
2,BEWARE! THIS IS A RE-RECORDING.,"Sunset Boulevard has one of the best film scores ever written. It is one of Mr.Waxman's masterpieces (if you consider a man with such a great talent can have many masterpieces).I didn't like this recording because (in my point of view) it falls into the temptation of making bigger, broader, lusher an orchestra that (in the movie) was tightly conducted and recorded.The music is beautiful and I am sure it will delight your ears. But call me a purist... I prefer listening to the original recordings in the movie (unfortunately not available on CD). Most film music cannot live outside the film. Sunset Blvd. is NOT one of those. Yet, in the movie, it is subtle, discreet and quiet. On the new recordings from classical Films (such as this) they have a tendency to overdo the music.That's what I feel about this recording."
4,I'm a member of ESRA,"and I just knew that having a Cpringer Spaniel on my charm bracelet would help show my love for the wonderful breed that they are. I wish I could have afforded the gold, but the silver is great. I would recommend it to anyone"
5,WAY TO GO RITA!!!!,"This is an AWESOME CD for people who loves Beatles and / or Bossa Nova. For the rest it is as good as you'll get from a brazilian lady singing Beatles songs. Absolutely great gift. Just relax, get a drink and let the music play!!"
5,Absolutely B-U-T-FUL!,"Where should I begin? Hmmm.....I guess I should probably stop playing this album if I want to be able to finish this review! It's just so beautiful! From a Bossa Nova Music lover's perspective....this is as good as it gets. Rita has the most touching voice. If I were to dream of what a female Brazilian singer sounds like....she is it. Not being a typical Beatles fan (they wouldn't be in my playlist), I still believe I am qualified to say that she more than does these Beatles songs justice!"
3,"Interesting read, but not for CISSP preparation","While an interesting read and applicable for a security professional, if you are interested in a book strictly to help with CISSP preparation, try the CISSP Prep Guide instead.Regardless, I still enjoyed reading it."
2,Not so great.,"Adding this cable to my monitor caused ghosting, the double images you get with some monitor extension cables. In my experience, this tends to happen more with cheap cables like this. Some monitors are more susceptible than others, I purchased a different (better quality) cable locally and it does not cause the same problem. It's so cheap I won't bother to return it, but lesson re-learned for me."
1,One hour boredom,"1 1/2Arranged with a remix CD mentality through and through, vacantly repetitious techno overpowers any organic funk the band's been known to bring."
2,US cars only,"If you own a US brand car then this may work for you. I had to go to a hardware store and buy long metric bolts just to be able to use this thing. I am shocked that it doesn't have metric bolts, maybe KD tools is not aware of the fact that 99% of the world switched to metric decades ago and that other tool makers ship metric bolts stock."
2,Must be for Foley fans...,"A brief review. It's pretty dated, of course. He talks a lot about what Flair said in his book, and harps on it for pretty much the entire shoot. I stopped liking Foley (legit) after he turned heel in 2006. I don't know, I just never had a reason to like him after that. So maybe I'm biased. I just don't find his schtick cute anymore, so I really didn't like this shoot. But for ardent Foley fans, they'll really enjoy more for what he has to say, even if you've probably heard it many many times before."
3,"Different! In a sick, twisted, entertaining way, it was new!","Different! In a sick, twisted, entertaining way, it was new! Kinda gross but kept my attention."
5,Perhaps the most interesting illustrator today,"This is the best book present I've ever received. Whenever I come across AT's work in the New Yorker, I take a second, third, fourth look. There's definitely a pop sensibility in all his drawings, which I find appealing. The NY illustrations have been getting a little worn around the edges. AT's work brings back some of that edge that makes the NY still interesting--if only for the original art. (Someone dump their poetry editor!) That he could marry bright scenes and clean lines with his often alienated characters is a testament to his skill. Anomie has rarely been so colorful or so curious."
4,VERY GOOD,"Thank you Logo and thank you SF Rockdogs for inspiring me. I'm sorry it took me so long to watch it, Wow! What I missed!"
2,This book is mis-named,"I do not think this book is for the ""absolute beginner"". It has been frustrating trying to build the programs in the book, because, even in the first chapter, the author does not explain how to do things, he just says ""do it"". I am sorry I bought the book. I am now using ""Visual Basic 6 Complete"", which I find much better for a beginner like myself."
2,Good as a 2nd VB reverence book,I learned VB years back and was looking for a book just to brush up on it again and this book is not a good reference book for that. Things that I wanted to brush up on are not even covered in the book. As a beginners book I don't think its very good book for that. It has some good information in it but you have to have some understanding of VB and anything that would be useful for practical programming isn't even covered.
3,Predictable but good,Dieselboy has been a steady artist that we have always been able to rely on for pumping out some pounding and crazy jungle. This cd is much like all of his other ones and is very typical of him. It can definitely be considered to add to the collection but if you are looking for something new than this is not it.
4,JUNGLICIOUS!,"DIESELBOY COULD ROCK ANY HOUSE WITH PHAT MATIERAL LIKE THIS. HE'S SHOWED ME THAT HE IS THE MOONTRIBE'S DRUM'N'BASS MASTER. HE'LL BUMP THE SUBS, MAKE THE HIGHS SCREAM IN YOUR EAR, AND MAKE YOU WANNA GROOVE YOUR BODY ALL NIGHT LONG. HE EVEN HAS TWO CUTS ON THIS DISC OF HIS OWN. NOT MANY ELECTRONICA DJ'S NOW A DAYS DO SUCH A THING, SO HE GETS BONUS POINTS FOR THAT ONE."
2,scorchingly so-so,"In this mix, restless drumz careen your way at breakneck speeds, riding atop phearsome bolts of headstrong bass. There's no shortage of sonic energy here, and Dieselboy's mixing is uber-tight.Still, I'm kind of disappointed. I prefer wild, original beats in hard jungle, but the underlying beats change little over the course of the entire disc. Predictability is boring, and this mix offers few surprises. Don't get me wrong -- it has its high points, such as E-Sassin's ""Symptom"", Dom & Roland's ""Can't Punish Me"", Technical Itch's ""Deadline"", and the wicked bass globs in Hive's ""Ultrasonic Sound"". Even so, I don't feel this CD is worth the money I paid for it."
2,have we changed songs yet?,"I have to admit that even though i am a big fan of diesel boy, this cd was very boring. The beats are too similar on every track, and the cd as a whole just has no ""feeling"" to it. If you want to hear him at his best, by 97 octane."
3,More of the same,"I must admit this is not as good as their other CD's (in my opinion at least). Still it is hypnotic and you want to listen to it till the end. It's the same psychedelic formula that you hear on all their works. With the Tentacles, you either love them or feel indifferent. If you liked their other stuff, then by this one as well."
4,The first Ozric albums I've heard,"This, along with Arborescence, were the first two Ozric albums I've heard. Jurassic Shift is as you expect from other Ozric albums, lots of killer spacy jams, killer guitar, and spacy synthesizers. ""Sunhair"" and ""Stretchy"" are just nothing short of amazing, while I found a lot of the rest of the album a little uneven. Some of it seems to drag on a little longer than it needs to, but at least there's that mystical feeling I can't get enough of. I more prefer Arborescence since that album didn't fall so much in that filler trap like the last couple of cuts on Jurassic. Still, if you're a newcomer to the Ozrics, both this, and Arborescence are wonderful places to start."
5,Archetypal Tentacles,"This is the first Ozric album I have heard, so of course it has special meaning. I personally think this album stands out from everything else they have done, although Arborescence is close. There is something about this album that is just timeless. I strongly recommend it."
5,Ozrics do it again....,"Somebody had once remarked that the Ozric Tentacles had released a number of recordings based on a repeated theme. If that's the truth, then they must be doing something right, because this is music that never gets boring. They slam into us with their ethnic-influenced, trippy-hippy psychedilic dance music. Great stuff."
4,ASPECTS OF HAWKWIND,"Its a strange world that this CD puts you in, its kind of similar to what happens when you listen to the very best moments of Hawkwind, very spacey. I like this CD alot because it takes some big risks and pulls them off. I would call Ozric ambient neo progressive with a tad of fusion mixed in and as I say, any body who likes the more keyboard aspects of Hawkwind must give this a go. Its very consistant and for a 1992 recording the sound is cutting edge. There is no need to indulge in nocturnal activities the great music makes you feel bent even if youre not, oh yeh the cover of the CD is cool also. Get this CD its great."
3,EF 90-300mm f/4.5-5.6 USM Canon Lens,"I've been using the EF 90-300mm f/4.5-5.6 USM lens for some time now and it is a good lens considering it's value. It creates a sharp image whether you're up close and personal or shoot's distances. Moonshots are great, even shoot'n ""handheld"" gets a nice clear detailed lunar image. Recommended mostly for landscape photography. :)"
2,How I Liked Where The Red Fern Grows,The book was pretty good. The reason I didn't love the book is because im not the kind of person that likes slow and sad books I like the fast action books but the imagery in this book was magnificent! it was stronger than I could imagine. Most people say its a book that makes you cry. If you like the sad books that make you cry you should consider reading this book!
4,where the red furn grows,"Where the Red Furn Grows is a book about a young boy that lived in the Ozark mountians named Billy Colman. All his life all he wanted was two hunting dogs. His parents offered him a collie but he wouldn't have anything but what he wanted. Over the summer he finds a way to get his dogs.He named them Old Dan and Little Ann.He spent the rest of his time training his dogs. When racoon season opened he hunted every night and still did his chores in the middle of the day. He turns his dogs into the finest pair of hunting dogs in the Ozark mountains. I would recomend this book to kids that are nine to eleven years old, likes the outdoors and dogs.By Scott F."
4,The award winning where the red fern grows,Do you like books that have action and adventure. Do you like books that are set in the outdoors. Do you like books that make you laugh and cry. If so then where the red fern grows is for definately for you.This book is about a boy that wants coon hounds. So he earns the money by selling stuff to the fisherman. He saves his money for two years and finally gets enough money to buy the hounds. He goes and picks them up in town. He names the dogs big dan and little ann.This book shows how a boy in the country grows up hunting and fishing. And going through the hardships of being poor. If you like the award winning hatchet and books whith in that category then I would definately reccomend you checking out the book WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS.BY: JAMIE SCOGIN
2,Not very good,"This book is about a boy living in the Ozarks with his two hounds. It did not really live up to my expectations. There were some good parts, but not enough to make up for the rest of the book. The ending was too predictable, the mother seemed too preachy, and Billy's sisters didn't even have names. The most entertaining part of the book was when the town kids called Billy a ""hillbilly"", because he actually was named Billy and he lived in the hills. The book wasn't even very sad (to me). If you like books about dogs, then read this (so long as you don't mind bittersweet, if predictible endings.)"
4,Red Firn rocks!!!,Where the read firn grows is a great book. It takes you on an adventure of a boy and his dogs. The bond between Billy and his dogs is so real.They have had many adventures but my favorite was when the dogs cought their first coon.The dogs work toghether so well it almost seems unreal. The ledgend of the red firn brings the book to life.
5,Were the Red Fern Should Grows,Where the Red Fern Grows was a very good book. It was filled with exciting chapters. It raelly got to me when the dogs died. Billy was a very intresting charecter but he really should work on his crying problem.
5,Where the Red Fern Grows Reveiw,"I thought Where the Red Fern Grows was a excellent book! It is about a boy,named Billy, that lives in the Ozarks of Oklahoma. He has been wanting two red blood hounds for a long time. He found a ad in a magazine that had two hounds for $50. He saved the money by working everyday. When he got them he trained them to be the best hounds in Oklahoma.They have a lot of deadly adventures in their hunts. Some that could have killed all of them. Little Ann and Old Dan (hounds)get in a fight with a huge mountain lion and it turns out to be a sad ending. Saving someones life can cost yours but it is the love and the thought that counts.3BRS"
5,Where The Red Fern Grows,"Where The Fern Grows is a great book.IT is about a 10 Years old boy name Billy.He wants two Houngs and he save his money for two years,just to get them dogs. Them dogs are smart and they can hunt. The dogs help Billy every time he was in trouble. Everywhere that Billy went Billy had a ax with him. He loves his dos so much that when he frist got the dogs he fought for them dogs.Then they got to see The Red Fern Grows. It is intersting, you should read it someday.4 periodA.T.G"
5,Awesome book!,"Where the Red Fern Grows is an excellent book. Probably one of the best books ever written. I give it five stars. The book is written by Wilson Rawls. The story takes place in a rural area during the depression. The main characters are a young boy, about 11 years of age, and his two hound dogs. The book is about the relationship between the boy and his dogs. If you are one of those people who like sad books then this one is for you! It's a real tear-jerker! I read this book and when i got done with it I had streams of tears rolling down my cheeks. This is a really great book. I highly recommend that you read it. The movies good too!"
4,My review on Where The Red Fern Grows,"This book was great, I really liked it. If you like adventure book, you should not miss this book. It was sad at the end, so maybe it will make you cry. The thing I don't like is that they don't really talk about the Red Fern a lot. The tile was ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" and in the book they talked more about the dogs, instead of about the Red Fern. I give this book 4 stars."
5,Where The Red Fern Grows,Awesome book!!!!! I wanted to find an original version to give to a friend in memory of her father. It was his favorite book. The book came in very good condition. The vendor was really nice and sent several emails to ensure I was pleased with my purchase. I would definitly buy from them again.
4,best book I ever read,This book is a moving book. It nags at your heart. I'm 10 years old and loved this book because it made me feel very excited and sad at the same time. Billy's love for his dogs is just something you can almost touch.
5,Classic,This book is a classic for a reason I've read it several times in my life. And its a great read every time.
5,Awesome,I really liked the bookIt made my days more specialI think other people should read this book this book is awesome
3,"was this book boring to you, or not?",to me this book was boring because it took all this time just to explain something that didnt really matter. you have to have a lot of patience to read this book. but it had a lot of great meanings in it.At the begining it was boring than it had alot of meaning in the ending.
5,"TISSUES, ANYONE?!?!","I read this book several years ago and it still remains probably my favorite book. As an animal lover, I was already biased towards the story, but I don't think I've ever cried sooooo hard at a story(except for the Green Mile). I was deeply moved and tremendously saddened. It may be a trite circumstance---a boy and his dog(s): think Old Yeller, Sounder, and My Dog Skip, but this novel is by far the best. The relationship that the boy develops with Old Dan and Little Anne is often humorous, but indentifiable and understandable. I highly recommend this book to not only kids, but to teachers, adults, and anyone looking for an emotional, heart-wrenching tale of love, friendship, and courage."
