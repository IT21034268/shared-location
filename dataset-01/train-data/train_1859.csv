5,Great read,"In Borders a few weeks ago I was looking for a new book, something different when I remembered ""Thank You For Smoking"" and how much I enjoyed the film. I had heard great things about the author (Christopher Buckley) and his work, so I figured he would be worth a read. After seeing the wide selection of books written by Christopher Buckley, I decided I'd try to go with one of his other books aside from TYFS, figured I'd be a little adventurous. I was not disappointed.I constantly found myself laughing out loud while reading this book which was usually followed by reading a paragraph or two to whomever was in the same room as me. Buckley creates a collection of characters who draw you in and his knowledge for political satire did not fail. There's no question I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a an intelligent read and a good read. I admit, the X-Files fan in me was drawn to the title, but the politically-savy would likely enjoy the book just as much as I did."
2,Disappointing,"I recently read Buckley's ""Thank you for Smoking"" and loved it. So, I was predisposed to liking ""Little Green Men."" Unfortunately, the book, and especially the main character, never grabbed me. Buckley re-uses many of the same puns (lobby group names) and characters (undercover women). If you want to read a Buckley book, try ""Thank you for Smoking."" It was captivating and hilarious."
3,RK Put Down Your Dictionary,"Robert Konrath, please put down your dictionary - your review was more verbose (wordy) than any book I've ever digested (read)."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This is one of the most uninteresting novels I have ever read. There was nothing in the whole book that was worth reading. The characters are so 1 dimensional that from the get go you can see through them all and wish you weren't reading the book. I finished the novel, just to see if it ever redeems itself. Please don't waste your time."
2,Excellent Airport Fluff,"Really just an extended National Lampoon piece that doubtless never would have been published but for the Beltway solid pedigree, the womb-lucky Mr. Buckley has written the perfect book for those extended airport delays plaguing those of us who don't fly private jet. The book is funny, yes, but while it purports to skew the D.C. crowd, it really just congratulates the reader for identifying who each character is pretending to ridcule. In short, the perfect roman a clef for the in-crowd. How many characters can you guess? How connected are you? So Banion is George Will, the hostess is Pamela Harriman/Katherine Graham, Kissinger is there...doubtless others that this poor fly-over country boy can't spot.Also, some of the humor is simply ham-handed. The Senate Hindsight Committee? Oh, please. Exhausted women demand the removal of Viagra from the market? Oh, Mr. Buckley, that's naughty don't you know!So, it's a quick engaging read, but not much more than that."
3,Worth reading if you hate George F. Will,"It would be hard for a novel to be as cleverly written and plotted as Buckley's first book, ""Thank You for Smoking,"" and ""Little Green Men"" isn't. Though Christopher Buckley's command of vocabulary (""chthonic"") is reassuring and his parody of George F. Will as the main character is welcome, his caricatures of Washington life get predictable and kind of boring after awhile. I am so impressed by Buckley's wit in general and his ability to carve out a separate life from his evil father that I will continue buying his books as they are published. Reading ""Little Green Men,"" however, gave me the feeling that he knows what his audience likes -- self-referential humor -- and is coasting on his existing reputation. I hope that he will stretch himself and not just become the yuppie neoconservative WASP equivalent of old Catskills comedians, chugging out the same stuff for decades to come."
5,Outstanding!,"The funniest book I've read since, well, since ""Thank you for Smoking"". This is a real writer's book as well, containing such prose as this:""Jamison's untimely death at the age of eighty-eight, after stepping on a garden rake, was treated by the establishment as the end of an era""To me that sentance alone is worth the book price, and there are many more to follow."
5,As enjoyable as Vonnegut!,"Christopher Buckley's ability to write great satire makes the plot of his stories inconsequential. That is not to say the story line is weak, in fact, it is just as entertaining as the one line parodies that constitute it.If you like Kurt Vonnegut you will enjoy reading ""Little Green Men"". There is nothing so sacred that it cannot be made fun of. I laughed out loud reading this book. And before I finished reading this title I bought ""Thank You for Smoking"", another great book by Buckley."
3,Worth Reading,"3-stars = worth reading. This book starts out strong andprovocative with recognizable characters and a unique premise. Itwould have been nice if Buckley put a little more into the build-up of the main character and, ultimately, the writing becomes a little slow and thin, which is unfortunate because there are many great moments."
2,Starts off like the X Files; ends up like a sleeping pill.,"This book began so well. I had just relocated to Washington DC (where the author lives and subsequently where the novel takes place most of the time) and some of the inside jokes are hilarious. I am an X Files fan and there is a similarity. Humor, a good plot line, a conspiracy and alien abduction. The problem is, it moves so slowly and then it gets corny. Not enough is left to the imagination. Too bad really, because I was enjoying it through the first 100 pages."
3,"Funny, but not as funny as ""Thank You for Smoking""","Every Saturday, I drop by the bookstore and pick up the weekly ""junk"" book -- a diversion that requires no deep thinking and may even provide a few yuks. Buckley's previous books (""White House Mess"", ""Smoking"", and have always met my needs perfectly (4 or 5 stars). This book is not quite as good. As noted by the other reviewers, the ending is weak; it seems as if Buckley just quit caring about two-thirds of the way through. I recommend waiting for the paperback."
3,"A nice story, but...","Buckley leads the reader on a romp through America, ranging from the private parties of the Washington elite to the stereotypical trailer park abductees.... He chooses to clarify vocabularly that doesn't need it, apparently doubting the intelligence of those of us outside Washington. If you've read Buckley before and like his style, go for it. If not, I'd recommend staying away."
3,Surprisingly funny comedy of personal folly!,"Christopher Buckley deserves a slap on the back about this book, along with congratulations. The premise of this book - a hard-core conservative political columnist ""abducted"" by ""aliens"" and forced into a life of conspiracy theory - is hilarious, and Buckley does a great job expanding upon it.I had a few problems with the setting, in that it takes place before the millenium, but certain events happen that can only occur after Clinton's presidency. It does help certain events in the story, however, so it isn't a big complaint.There aren't any other complaints I can think of. I recommend this book to fans of political humor and fans of conspiracy theory humor."
3,"A cross between the ""X-Files"" and ""Frasier""","First time Buckley reader who read the first 260 pages in two nights. To bad it took the next two nights to finish the final 40 pages. However, I will happily pass the book on to a friend as well as buy some of his other books."
3,Funny premise,"and a very good protagonist as well as accompanying cgaracters and situations, but, sorry, the only book of Buckley's that you need to read is Thank you For Smoking. The ending kinda just peters on out, and ruins an otherwise somewhat amusing read. (Maybe Buckley deserves a probe for this lazy tak-on?) If you have to read it, just take this one from your local library or maybe wait for the paperback. Trust me - you can wait."
3,A good book that loses its steam half-way through.,"Overall, this is a good book, but it loses its steam half-way through the story. Up until he loses his TV show, Banion is a great character - intelligent, powerful, witty, and hilariously snobbish. His reaming of the President over his NASA policy early in the book is a classic. Afterwards, however, he becomes disappointingly bland. People's feelings start to matter to him and he loosens up considerably, making him a better person but a far less enjoyable character. I was a bit disappointed with the ending because it was too pat. Hopefully, this won't give away too much, but everything's explained away and none of the main characters end up the worse for wear, which is ridiculous considering the enormity of the conspiracy Buckley creates. Even with all that, however, it's a good read."
2,Ain't Thank You For Smoking,"I love Christopher Buckley's writing and always turn to his pieces first when they appear in the New Yorker. But I was disappointed with his latest book. Compared with Thank Your For Smoking, this book is flat. I couldn't relate to any of the characters. Better luck next time."
2,Disappointing,"I loved Buckley's previous book, Thank You for Smoking, and eagerly anticipated the release of Little Green Men. I was disappointed. Gone are the cutting insights and absolutely hysterical humor. It seems as though, after making a name for himself with Smoking, Buckley has decided he no longer needs to work at his craft to win readers. That's a shame. I laughed out loud many times during Smoking, not once during this book. In fact, a barely managed a grin now and then. Buckley can be a simply terrific, engaging, and hilarious writer when he wants to be -- but not this time."
3,Good but not great,"This is mildly amusing but can't compare to Buckley's classic, Thank You for Smoking.The book starts out well---excellent premise (the US is staging alien abductions to up budgets) and Banion is the kind of oozing slime one loves to hate but somehow it just doesn't hang together well. There are a couple of good laughs but Buckley seems to be straining to make the laughs. A disappointment (buy a copy of Thank You for Smoking instead!)."
2,Clever plot does not make up for undeveloped characters,"Mr. Buckley delivers a clever story, but fails to fully develop potentially entertaining secondary characters the way Carl Hiaasen does. Additionally, Mr. Buckley's use of ""SAT"" words does not add to the plot, rather, it is distracting in the way an over-eager student in class might be. One can't help but think that Mr. Buckley is trying to live up to his father's famous vocabulary. However, his transparent inclusion of famous Washington icons adds a tantalizing bit of masked non-fiction to this political comedy (is Strom Thurmond really a perv?), and the protagonist of this tale, John Banion, is an interesting if not sympathetic composite of our favorite Sunday talk show hosts. Overall, Mr. Buckley deserves an ""E"" for effort."
4,Roadmap for Reinvention,Reinvent Your Work is straightforward advice on how to reinvent your career. Takes you step-by-step through the reinvention process. Written such that you feel you are sitting down over lunch with the author. Real-life anecdotes are compelling.
4,A pleasing light comedy,"Other reviewers have summarized the premise of this book, so I won't do so again here. I found this book to be a very appealing light romantic comedy of manners. It requires a little suspension of disbelief, but what farce does not? The characters are engaging, and I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent in their company."
3,Not that good,"I bought this book based on the over-whelming positive reviews, and I understood their reasons for liking it--it was a pleasing and light comedy; unfortunatelly, I also had to agree with the reviewer that gave the three-star rating. I, too, thought this was more for young adult readers. It just lack certain depth and sophistication for the plot and characters development, but it was also true that it is somehow funnier to see and read about male dressing up as females than vice versa. But I must say that I really liked the front cover of this large-print hard-cover book a lot, it really presented a old English charming mood, much better than most of the romance paperbacks with tasteless photos, and this book was very nicely bond which made very easy and pleasant to read."
2,Almost too silly for words,"When the nasty OTT villain is the most interesting character in a Regency romance, you know the book is in trouble. The hero can think of nothing but himself and his masculine pastimes, nevertheless the heroine has loved him since childhood. They decide to marry, but first she wants a 'Season' in London. Then the ridiculous begins, with the hero dressing up as his own grandmother in order to provide the heroine and his own sister with a chaperone. Oh, groan upon groan. Well, perhaps I'm not being entirely fair, for there are some funny moments, but the plot is so shot through with holes that it's infuriating. The ending is even more preposterous than anything that went before, and that's saying something. I'm afraid that even though the villain is fairly interesting, his motives and machinations are thoroughly distasteful, and leave a very queasy feeling. Not a book I would recommend to anyone."
5,Pokemon - Johto League Champions - Crash of The Dairy,This Pokemon VHS is the only Pokemon VHS that is not done Pioneer. This is a very good Pokemon VHS in episodes contents. It is very high voltage VHS though.
3,Mod quad kicker,"Kick starter is nicely built,but the designer needs to take another look at how it fits against the case. I have a factory clutch cover. I wanted the kicker to be positioned correctly,u know with the bar u rest ur foot on to start it,horizontal (flat). Not tilted back toward the swing arm. I guess the designer wanted the buyer to,rotate the kicker back one notch on the shaft splines? I personally didn't like that? The kicker rubs on the clutch cover,it doesn't allow the kicker to be at rest,because it's propped up on the side of the case. So I used a flap disk on a 4-1/2"" grinder,&reshaped the kicker. On the inside where it was touching. Then I re-polished it when I was done. I like the design,but for $[...] bucks? I shouldn't have had to do a thing to it,except slide it on the shaft&put the bolt in..."
5,Life Changing!,"I purchased this book as a precursor to coaching with Talane. I agree with the basic philosophy that Talane shares -- that you have to have your life ""cleaned up"" on all levels (ie., mentally, spiritually,etc.) before you can attract success in these areas. By illiminating the things that drain your energy, such as tolerations, you free yourself up to have more energy to put toward your goals. All of the above information is delivered in an upbeat and down-to-earth manner. I feel that working with Talane, combined with the tips in the book, have set me on the path of getting my life in great shape. Highly recommended!"
4,A good improvement resource to be revisited often,"As a reader of many business and self-improvement tomes, this book is worthy of being devoured word-for-word and will be referred to often. There is not much new under the sun, but this book presents things in an intelligent adult manner with specific examples. Each section begins with a concise description of the topic and then progresses into the example, I enjoyed the first paragraphs more than the examples and found myself highlighted 3 to 4 sentences under each topic to refer to later.Well written and a good overall primer that brings coaching guidance together in one book."
4,Great step by step for getting out of a rut,"I felt like I had so much going on and was just barely keeping my head above water. Talane's book offered a valuable step by step process to figure out where you are and actually make progress . . . in the right direction. I LOVE the suggestions she has and must admit that I have a constant list of irritating little things to get rid of, but at least I feel like I have accomplished something when I tackle it once a month. A great read for someone who feels stuck and doesn't know where to start. It is tempting to read ahead, but you get so much more out of it when taking things in the suggested sequence."
5,"A ""Must Have"" Book","I have worked through the steps and suggestions several times in the years that I have owned this book. I go back to it time and time again when I feel I need to get my life back on track. Besides being practical and readable, it offers ideas that are original and fun to work on.I highly recommend this book."
5,Re-read this book as often as you can!,I have read and re-read this book a couple of times now and carry it around on my Iphone for easy reference. It's insights are common sense but altogether make for a grouping of great tips and advice. I totally recommend it.
1,Does not practice good habits.,"I've just been under the misfortune of attending a speech of the author.A sense of anger had began rising when I listened to her discuss refusing people asking for a hand up.She said that when she counseled those who had deep, troubling backgrounds, she would tell them to seek other help and come back to her when they were stable.Not long before telling us she directed ""troubled cases"" to psychiatrist and therapists, she had also attempted to discredit both of the professions.To me, the author is no better than a paramedic who refuses to help a dying child because he or she is off-duty.I would be weary of people like her's opinions and theories on success. I believe she is mostly self serving, and is pushing towards others gaining her attitude on life."
1,MY TABLE WOBBLES NO MORE,"Well, the best I can say is that I bought an antique table that the legs were uneven. Using the techniques offered in this book, my table is now even."
3,"Does what it is supposed to do, but how is a product like this supposed to be any better.","Just as described, I don't like being asked to write such a long answer for a very simple question. This should be optional and not a requirement."
1,Some did not work,I cannot plug the male counterpart on one end of the device. I cannot fix because it is solid device. Do not buy
1,didn't work. dont buy,I bought this to add to the end of my audio extension cable to to extension my headphone range from my tv. The sound was deplorable. Absolutely horrible. I couldn't use them at all. I would advise against buying
3,no connection problem,"Quality looking, easy to grab rough plastic housing, fits properly and tightly, for me so far. - fits 3.5mm (1/8"") minature plugs. Average rating of 3 for an average product. If you expect to frequently be reconnecting ANY connection, suggest you spend more and hope for excellent long-lasting quality. Then, also suggest, gold plated contacts on everything. No reason to believe this connector will somehow break !"
5,Product Works and seems as if it's durable,"Haven't had it for long but I feel as if it's durable and will last for awhile! The coupler stays on tight, it isn't a loose fit which is what I was worried about."
5,just great,"i just love this product. It enables me to listen to my ipod through the usb port. I plug in a cable in the bottom that has an 3.5mm male end, add this adapter, plug in the earphones, and....we listen! It helped me alot since the earphone jack on the top has something stuck inside & its unusable."
3,Works but...,"The coupler works, like other reviews already state the connection isn't the greatest. I have to pull out the cord a little to make a good connection but for my use it works and it was CHEAP. I sure wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for this."
5,An excellent passive component for stereo hookups,The 3.5mm stereo coupler makes it so simple to connect two short stereo cords together when you have to have a longer cord. Saves you from the need to purchase a longer cord when two short cords connected together will do the job.
5,works,Great. Im currently using this to hook up my ps3 to computer speakers and the sound is solid. Can't go wrong with this.
5,3.5mm female to female stereo coupler,"The 3.5 female/female coupler does what its supposed to do. The metal portion is gold colored, not silver like the coupler shown. It provides a tight fit, stereo sound, and no static at a very fair price."
3,does what it is supposed to do,There's not much to about this product except to say it does what it is intended to do.This is a cheap and easy way to extend short audio cables.
5,It works with great price !,"I use this item to connect the audio in my car. Everything works great as aspected, no issue found. I would say best for the price."
5,Great Price!,Me and my buddy often hook up my Tv and a computer monitor to run 2 xbox's at once. This work great for connecting the audio adapter to the computer speakers.
3,Beautiful orchestral playing but variable singing and tepid conducting,"Oedip is a wonderful opera. In this work Enescu achieved focused melodies and dramatic passages from his highly chromatic style that he mostly failed to achieve in his orchestral and chamber music. I wanted to like this performance but it is definitely inferior to the Van Dam version with Foster conducting and even the old Electrecord LP version by Brediceanu and the Bucharest Orchestra. This version does have beautiful orchestral playing superior to those two earlier editions, but Gielen's conducting is slack with tepid tempos. The singing is not very inspiring either generally speaking."
5,How long has the Kiss community waited for this beauty!!!!!!,"Well, I know it aint out yet but figured it could use a simple review as its been circulating as a bootleg for ages - It's a great show put simply - Kiss in makeup with the best line up Kiss had during the 1980s (Gene/Paul/Ace/Eric).Great set too from the Unmasked tour so a few odd tunes rarely seen on other Kiss shows like Shandi and Talk To Me pop up alongside the classics.... the live drum sound sounds a bit like upturned bathtubs being hit with mallets but other than that a top notch DVD (hopefully!).Chris"
4,Good introduction to Kierkegaard's philosophy,"Kierkegaard had a complicated personality, and wrote many of his greatest works under pseudonyms. He is ponderous and verbose a great part of the time. But the reader who persists is richly rewarded. According to Stendahl, Kierkegaard ignored most philosophical questions, or rather, approached them from unconventional angles and therefore one must be familiar with his indirect method of exposition to get the most from his writings. In the first three chapters, she gives background biographical material and then provides summaries of the thought in some of Kierkegaard's major works such as Fear and Trembling and Either/Or. These are not a substitute for reading Kierkegaard directly. But for those who have read his books, they are good review summaries. For those who feel daunted by Kierkegaard, they can act as appetizers to get you to go for his books."
2,Warning - these are re-recordings,"These are re-recordings of 20 great songs that are all available elsewhere. However, the price is a good bargain. I should point out that the photo of the cover shown on Amazon is different than the one on the CD I purchased, even though the content on the disc is identical."
4,"Lovely, Serene Acoustic Guitar","This is my first album by Alex De Grassi and I am impressed with his skill and style. Pure acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by bass or percussion, but no vocals. This album of versions of old time folk music is both respectful of the music and yet playful and frisky. Great version of Saint James Infirmary (see my list of the many many versions of this amazing old song)."
5,Not Left Feeling You Need A Little More,"Skillet cranked will make your ear drums bleed. HUGE guitar power mixed with unbelievable vocal strength makes this album a MUST own for all rock lovers. Stolen, lost or scratched I have owned three copies of this CD because I have to have it in my CD changer at all times; YES this album is that good. If you haven't heard Skillet this is the album you need to start with and I dare you to crank ""Savior"" because afterwards you may need new speakers. Skillet is pure adrenaline for your radio."
5,Great Album,After years of searching I finally found a good Christian Rock band. This is their best album so far.
4,Not bad. Liked Comatose better.,"Saw Rebirthing on the Gospel Channel and owned Comatose less than a week later. Great CD. So I decided to get their previous release and was a little let down by it. Of course I recognized Savior, but beyond that, it just didn't do much for me."
3,Great Cd,Again they have came out with another great cd.Except this time it's heavier My favorite Songs are Savior andThe Second song(Can't remember what it's called.) This cd is a must get for Skillet fans. I personally am one of them.There are rarely any slow songs. This cd is for someone that likes things a little heavier than your average Skilletcd Ex. Hey you I love your Soul is not heavy as Collide.
3,Pretty good,I bought this cd just to buy something and I was impressed at first. But now it's just old. And it got old quick. I'm not meaning to bash them but I thought it would stay in my cd player for a week the way everyones talking.
4,the review,"Other than a few very minor flaws this album was very well produced. I only have two complaints. One is that the strings are low quality strings. We all know the strings are from Korey's keyboards but cmon, make em sound real. My second complaint is that the couple solos that the few guitar solos they did have were not loud enough. They are too vague and leave alot to be desired. Other than these two flaws this is an awesome album. John's voice is very raspy which normally would sound like crap, but he makes it sound good."
5,Hard Hitting CHRISTIAN Rock,"I have read so many reviews about people asking ""Are Skillet christian now"" and stuff like that because the lyrics aren't corny and don't come straight out and say ""Jesus loves you"". God forbid you actually having to LISTEN to the lyrics and find the meaning yourself instead of it being blatently corny. I saw these guys in concert and I can tell you they are definately still great christians. Anyways, this album is awesome, very hard hitting and probably the best they have put out so far. And while it has its hard songs, they also find a few spots to slip in a great slow worship song. I would recommend this album to anyone."
5,Great rock for anyone!,"Skillet's ""Collide"" is one of the best albums I have ever bought. Their music is satisfying to everyone, and still has a Christian meaning. Their lyrics and melodies mix perfectly together, and the instrumentals are great! I would really request this band to anyone want good, hard rock! Thanks!"
5,Skillet is one of thee best CHRISTIAN bands AROUND,Man i got this cd when it first came out not knowing what to expect from them. I have all their cds and they keep getting better by each cd. Yes it is a lot different from Alien Youth which was very good but i think whatever new cd Skillet has out will top the previous. This cd his a lot more heavy then the other ones they don't use the keyboards played by his wife. He screams in a lot of songs.
5,Skillet is #1 in hard rock Christian,"i luv this cd!! some ppl say that the songs are too ""depressing"" but if you actually listen to the songs they DO start out as kinda bleak but gradually they sing about the hope and that everything will turn out alright! i don't think anyone can resist this cd at first b/c my bff only likes classical music stuff but after hearing just a FEW songs off of this cd she loved it and went out and bought the cd!"
4,I see a glimmer of their first album,I was so excited when this album came out. I had greatly missed the skillet of old. I love the hard rocking Skillet. They have reverted back to their guitar-driven songs. This is a more mature and exciting Skillet. I Love it!
5,Loud and all for God,"I read that someone said that this CD is not Christian. Well I have to say that this CD is Christian in a different way. Skillet sings by screaming to Jesus Christ. I'm a huge fan of Skillet and this CD is by far there best. Energy, Savior, Open Wounds and Forsaken are my favorites from this CD. This is a must have for anyone who like music period. Also, when you put it into your computer it plays a little DVD like clip. Very cool. Just buy it."
3,Gaining momentum,"The band really begins to shine in new ways on this disc. Not all of the tracks could be hits (in fact, I'd say nearly half are b-side material at best). But the tracks that do hit home are breathtaking and make this album worth owning."
4,Thoughtful heavy rock metal tunes!,"This is a cool, deep band with suprisingly positive heavy catchy rock metal tunes, and inspiring lyrics. Try this good uplifting album by a very different band. Cool stuff."
5,Just Good Stuff,"I'm not going to go into a long narrative about this disc.. I own it,I like it I think it's great and if you're looking for some good christian rock then buy it. BUT if you're looking to buy this because you like Skillet then be careful because before this disc came out I didn't particularly care for them. This disc has a pretty different sound from their previous releases.. I'm not saying that they're bad I'm just saying that I personally don't care much for their sound before this disc..I hope that this review has been helpful for you........."
5,daughter loves it!,16 year old loves Skillet! she is thrilled with this CD- Not much else you can say but that! :)
3,Skillet does it again...,"There's one thing that kind of irks me about Skillet. Buy one album, and the next CD is something completely different. I found Skillet back when their first self titled album was released. When ""Hey You, I Love Your Soul"" came out, I jumped for it immediately but was completely dissapointed! Then came Invincible, a new Skillet with a whole new sound and feel. I found this album to be lukewarm. When Alien Youth came out, it seemed like Skillet was finally settling in on a style, and from the melodic ""The Thirst is Taking Over"" to the in your face ""Earth Invasion"" they seemed to be doing well in developing their industrial/rock sound. With Collide, they've changed their style once again, now diving into more mainstream hard rock sounds. Its an okay album, but listening to it didn't particularly impress me. The vocals can use some work, and musically it sounds too much like music I've heard before. Perhaps we'll see some more creativity the next album?"
2,Tastes Great but Less Filling,"First of all I love(d ?)Skillet. The composition and arrangement of the music is always first rate, and this continues on this album. The sound quality, energy and excitement in their albums is always high, and this continues on this album. Their lyrics are always uncompromising, unashamedly Christian, and not shy about using the name of Jesus, and this is absolutely missing on this album. Lyrically what you get is Christianity lite, and Christianity in disguise. Oh don't get me wrong there is Christianity on this album, you'll just have to look for it, where in their other albums it was in the open for all to see. Skillet used to be my favorite lyrical band, and they also stood out as Christian leaders. Now they wear ""The Exploited"" t-shirts, and hide their faith. Where is the lyrical courage and genius of ""I Can?"" Seems to me like they're taking over the world by assimilating to it."
4,Polished,"Verrry smooth- this is a nice collection of chilled tracks from a range of my favourite artists, Apollo 440, Leftfeild, Morcheeba and Orbital - great to read, study or just to listen to... leaves you with a warm, calm feeling while keeping enough pace and rhythm to keep you interested. Can't really compare to other chillout CDs as this is my first but if this is anything to go by I will defiantely be buying more!"
2,"Good Idea, Poor Execution","The places ""visited"" in this vidoe are certainly must-sees if you decide to go to Istria (Birthplace of Lidia Bastianich!). Too bad that the video quality leaves a lot to be desired. Washed out colors, hazy vistas, often too-fast panning all combine to make the area not exactly enticing. The unique blue-ness of the Adriatic never comes through; a shame since that is one of the chief draws to the area. Perhaps, Rick Steves will one day decide simply to do one (or better yet, a series) vidoe on just the Croatian Adriatic. I'm sure his level of professional skill and attitude would do it justice. For now, you'll have to be satisfied with his Eastern Europe set of DVD'sRick Steves' Eastern Europe."
1,Wild Game Butchering,"Video does NOT hold up to its title, to any significant exaggeration. Extraordinarly brief regarding the butchering, and does not give the viewer the opportunity to complete the job on their own. Running time was only forty minutes with at least half covering how to BBQ and cook...? Very little detail on butchering. Poorly labeled video. Does not teach the different cuts or go through them. I butchered this year but other video resources were essential. Will not gain significant knowledge from this video to attempt butchering on your own. ...not informative as title implies, sorry."
2,You get what you pay for,"Well, so much for finding a hidden gem. This video is sorely mistitled. About 5 minutes is spent on helping you butcher the wild game they discuss. Most of their advice is, ""Follow the line of the muscle."" There, you now know about all they are going to tell you. The rest of the time is spent on recipes and cooking the meat. The host says he is a chef right at the beginning and that tells you where the whole tape is going after that. You can find better resources than this on the internet with a search engine. If it weren't for the cooking tips, I would have given it 1 star since it doesn't even come close to delivering what it advertises"
1,Better video called the Finest Cuts,"If you want a great video on butchering a deer or elk search: The Finest Cuts. This video is extraordinary. The production value is excellent and the description and skill of the host is great. I have watched it over and over just for the knowledge how it related to beef cuts and I have learned so much! The Finest Cuts: a hunter's guide to deer processing, is the full title."
3,Various Biblical Errors,"The overall book was good, but there were a couple Biblical errors. Especially in talking about the washing of feet, names were given to people that did not have names in the Bible. Also, there was a section where they discovered a part that is important to the overall plot and it appears that part of the conversation is skipped and hard to follow."
1,Failed to hook me,"I read the previous book in this series, Maire, and while I definitely wasn't impressed (I gave it a weak three stars) I did decide to give the author one more try.Unfortunately I only made it through about 30 pages of Riona. The book was bogged down (no pun intended) by an overabundance of long, descriptive, expository passages. There wasn't enough dialogue or anything really happening for me to even remember what was supposed to be happening. I felt like I was reading more of a dissertation on ancient Irish culture than an actual story. Perhaps it is because I just finished an excellent series of fast-paced, action-driven books. Or perhaps it is just that I am extra tired this evening. Whatever the case, Riona utterly failed to hook me enough to make me want to read past the first 30 pages. Given that I wasn't impressed with this author's previous book, I figured this one wouldn't get any better and so would be a waste of my time for me to read further."
3,Some issues,"I love the way the product looked. It came in one piece and was easy to get out of the box and put where we wanted. The only flaws I have found are that the drawers move poorly sometimes. And we had one draw come out and the slider break, but my husband was able to fix it. Beautiful up close and at a distance."
1,"Looks great,, but poor quality construction and flimsy material","Don't be fooled by the description ""Cherry"". These Leslie Dame products are made in China and while they are real wood, the wood is of extremely low quality. This is not cherry. It is some kind of cheap, soft wood that has been stained dark to look like cherry. It is extremely soft and prone to splitting and cracking, as I discovered when the unit arrived, due to insufficient padding for transport. The entire back panel of the unit is a thin sheet of wood board and had come undone.The drawers are difficult to pull out due to poor construction. Yesterday, I pulled out one of the top drawers too far and it dropped to the floor, where a chocolate-bar sized section of the front panel broke off!To make things worse, the varnish sticks to certain objects placed on it! Looks nice, but the poor quality and construction really shows. Avoid this product."
4,Most Definitey NOT a Novelty Item,"Those that love Rudy Ray Moore's stand up routines know it's his overamped bellow, with which he could just as easily start his own end-of-the-world cult, that makes his audacious vernacular wordplay so damn funny. The voice serves him well as a soul singer also, communicating the same level of passion that all the 60s greats put into their simple, shamelessly emotional music. Granted, there's some filler here (no comp this extensive is going to be seamlessly good), but the winners (like ""Ready, Willing And Able"" and the bluesy ""Hully Gully Papa"") rank with anything else in the genre. I think it's great that anyone would buy this strictly for the kitcsh value if that's the only way they would dig into cleansing soul--it'll do them good. Don't sell the man short because he happens to be more successful in the comedy arena; Ray Charles can crack a joke, too."
1,Don't step in this steaming soft spot,"Ever wonder what Neil Young might sing like after an accident incurred while hurdling a barbed-wire fence? If so, this is the CD for you. If not, then...Wake up!! Unless you're over 60 AND thinking of calling it quits soon, don't waste your time with this limp wishy-washy stuff. There are people out there making real music - go out and get yourself some."
1,Flush this floater,"Be warned: the editorial review's reference to ""Eef Barzelay's lovably awkward voice"" is thinly-veiled code for: ""this guy REALLY can't sing."" I'd rather listen to the non-vocal but equally pleasant emanations bouncing 'tween the stained walls of a bus station restroom stall. The music is lifeless, dull, stupifying. Oh, and not very good either.Be doubly warned: a couple of these tunes are the sort you really don't like but find yourself humming later in the day. You don't want to remember the tune. You can't stand the tune. But it's there, right there in your head. You trying flushing it away, but it only circles the porcelain and manages to float and defy the drain. Must keep flushing..."
5,Don't Make It Stop,"They've done it again. Those crazy lads of Firewater have produced another gem.The Man on the Burning Tightrope is a circus nightmare like Mr. Kite on a bad acid trip. Play it for your friends, under hot lights if you want them to confess deeply held secrets. Full of hope and optimism, if you're looking forward to falling into a spiralling inferno. A rock'in 3 ring punk klezmer celebration of doom, interspersed with burlesque, t.v. themes for shows too dangerous to air, and drunken carousel rides.Tod A is a genius. Too bad he can't use his incredible intellect for good instead of evil."
4,"Not their best, but still good","My favorite Firewater is probably Get off the Cross. That album has a number of different sounds, but comes together to make a great package. This album feels a tad listless, and meanders a bit too much.There are still some good songs and is overall worth the purchase."
3,Mediocre,"Bought this after hearing an awesome song by the same group on a compilation disk. Firewater does have an interesting style, but the CD overall doesn't really have any ""stand-out"" songs that energize or engage the listener. It's above average in technical aspects as well as in creativity, but it's lacking the spark that draws the listener in. I imagine they'd be a good band to see live, though."
4,Great product,"My 10 year old daughter loves it - she loves putting blue and pink streaks in her hair. Fairly easy to use, but sometimes hair gets tangled, so you need to be careful. It's not messy like the spray in color, so I don't mind doing it for her. Only takes a few minutes to put several streaks in. Changing color cartridges is simple."
1,This is the biggest bait and switch,"If I could give it less than zero stars, I would. I don't know how anyone can say this works great. Maybe they can tell me what I'm doing wrong because I can't get this thing to work at all. I bought it for my daughter's birthday thinking she could have some fun with temporary hair color. She has brown hair and nothing showed up at all. I tried everything -- dry hair, wet hair, dirty hair, clean hair -- you name it, I tried it, and we couldn't even get a remote hint of color. The picture on the package makes it look as easy and successful as painting your hair -- total false advertising. I kept meaning to return it but never did -- now, it will end up at a garage sale for 5 cents and a note saying ""purchase at your own risk"""
3,Not as great as it looks,"I purchased this items for my daughter, as a washable option for coloring her hair. Make sure to add some water to the pad and let it sit before using. The hair will also be a little wet and will need time to dry. I probably wouldn't purchase again because she doesn't even use it anymore."
1,Father,"Poorly described , falsely sold - it gives you the impression it comes with the appilcation kit , which has been discontinued- its worthless without it and should be a free return and credit."
1,Conair Pro Color Accents Refill Kit,".........I am sure this product works great, however, I still haven't received the Conair QC1RP Pro Color Accents Tool, so this product remains unopened until I do receive the other product that I ordered, until I am able to use the refill, I can not rate its actual performance, however the ""thought"" of it is good!"
1,bad product!! it sux,"ok i highly suggest NOT getting this, all my friend says about it is horrible, it like makes her hair snarly, and stuff, and the colors suck, i mean, come on, get better colors, like the other person said, purple would be COOL"
3,Pretty Good,"I first read this book about ten years ago, when I was twenty. I thought it was hilarious then. I recently re-read it and thought it was pretty good, though I didn't find it as funny as I had in 2002.Just one note: Bill Bryson mentions a Lear Jet crash about a fifth of the way into the book. He says that no-one had been able to locate the airplane. There is then an update from two years later, saying they had *still* not been able to locate the aircraft.If anyone is interestied, the jet was found, almost three years after it went down. The details are located here:[...]"
2,Misleading title and book description,"I read this book hoping for some interesting insights on what it must be like to live in England for 20 years and then return to the US. I was looking for indications on the subtle and not-so-subtle differences between these two countries (""Separated by a common language,"" as Winston Churchill used to say).Instead, for the majority of the book, I got a mixed bag of musings on inconsequential topics in the style of Andy Rooney, along the lines of ""Have you ever noticed how the cutting thing on the floss container always seems to. ...""This book has pot-boiler written all over it; and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,A Rip-Off Disappointment,"I have been a Bill Bryson fan for many years, but this book comes off as a commercial rip-off, taking a collection of his newspaper columns, throwing them together, and saying, ""Here is my latest book."" Sorry, but that will not fly. It was funny in places, sure, because Bryson has the gift of turning a phrase, but much of it just plods along on topics of little or no consequence. I think I've had enough of Bill Bryson by now, though I'll revisit some of his earlier efforts with great pleasure."
4,"Good, but Bryson can be preachy","Bryson has been one of my favorite authors for years now - the first thing of his that I read was a magazine article comparing American weather extremes with those in his beloved England. This collection of his writings on things American has me confused. Most of it, as his wife points out, is griping about this and that. Bryson has a tendency to talk down anything that doesn't fit into his view of how life ought to be and a maddening myopia when it comes to understanding why things are the way they are in this modern world. Balancing that though is his self-deprecating humor and his beautiful writing skills. There is a piece on global warming in this book that all ought to read. So, basically, even though he is preachy, and a bit gripy, he is laugh-out-loud funny and writes so very well that I will keep reading him."
3,"Funny, But Gets Repetitive","This is a collection of short anecdotes and columns about the trivialities of American life. Small town diners, backyards, drive-in movies, lots of businesses that cater to drivers.It's fun to read, but how many criticisms of metal-framed diners can you read about?"
2,"The book is nice, but comes with publisher restrictions and DRM","This book is an entertaining read, but the ""Text to Speech"" feature on my Kindle2 won't work with this book -- presumably due to the publisher wishing to sell an audio-book for an additional fee. Be careful of DRM infected eBooks!"
2,If you like non-stop complaining!!!!,"I enjoyed ""A Walk in the Woods"" on tape, so I bought the tape of ""I'm a Stranger Here Myself"". While there's some amusing anecdotes and insights, this book is something best taken in very, very small doses. Especially on tape, Mr. Bryson is a world-class whiner. He complains, kvetches, and moans about every small annoyance that confronts people in everyday life. If life is really this bad for him, I'm surprised he ever leaves the house."
1,Misleading,"When I buy a chocolate cake, I expect it to be chocolate inside and out unless the label says otherwise. This book was chocolate on the outside and marble or plain white once opened. As a person who has re-entered the U.S. on 4 different occasions after living overseas in various places for extended periods of time, I felt really cheated. The author writes of some of the culture shock he encounters, but spends much of the time rambling on about things that have no relevance to the title. I did not expect biology lessons on why leaves change color in the fall, skunks (are there none in England?), his childhood memories of Iowa, etc. I could barely get through the last, very long chapter on English architects, architecture, and furniture makers. If I'd wanted to read up on those subjects I would purchased appropriate books. This book was a waste of my time -- and money!"
2,Hostile,"After reading ""A Short History of Nearly Everything,"" I became a fast fan of Mr. Brysons writing style. I felt that he inserted humor and wit with accurate fact.However, this book takes on a very hostile, almost scathing review of the USA. I pity the foreign reader on what seems to be a very downtrodden review of the United States as a whole.Granted after not living in his country of birth for over twenty years, it is not nearly as terrible as Mr. Bryson makes it out to be.The book starts out with humor and wit, and turns sharply to a very disappointed view of what the USA has become in his absence. The book is riddled with what seems to be one constant complaint about everything and anything. I am sorely unsatisfied with the contents, and would not recommend this piece due to it's brief chapters and sore dissatisfaction with living in America."
2,Tedious reading,"This was required summer reading for my son's AP ""English"" class. He is an avid reader but is trudging through this book. At first it seems quirky and interesting but is repetitive and meandering. He said it is like reading an entire book of editorial magazine columns without the benefit of reading what the editorial is on."
1,Unpatriotic,"A book that I thought was supposed to be about re-experiencing the U.S. from a foreigner's standpoint turned out to make a mockery of Americanism. Don't get me wrong, I agreed with some of the issues he discussed, but I felt it was a political, whiny, irrelevant and diluted book that was masquerading as a comic novel. A shame, because I liked Bryson's other books, and I read it on my honeymoon."
2,Not his best book....,"Bryson is an author with tremendous flair and expertise... I tried to remind myself that this was written by the man that brought us ""Notes from a Lost Continent""...Sorry, ""Stranger"" is...not his best book, and I can only hope his book on Australia is better..."
1,More complaining than humor,"Parts of the book were funny. The book was portrayed as very funny and at first I would have agreed but then the author ventures into many more subjects that obviously upset him quite a bit about America. Bill Bryson can find a tremendous amount wrong with America and that seems to be his desire in this FREE Country but don't claim that the book is ""on an affectionate, hysterically funny tour"". I was looking for humor when I purchased the book."
5,One of my favorites!,"I bought this book in Germany as the funny part of the preparation of my ~2 year stay in the US (beside serious literature). I found a lot of interesting hints why people in the US are sometimes different to people in Europe (especially in Germany).Bill Bryson is pointing to several things like food, shopping and other problems how to get settled in another country. He made sometimes the same type of experiences that we did.I love this book because it shows things that are totally normal to people in the US but seem strange to people from other countries (e.g. the waste of energy). He does not blame people for what they are, he just shows how they are and tries to explain why."
4,"Quirky, curmudgeon's take on returning to America after 20 y","Personally, I found Bryson's books ""A Walk in the Woods"", and ""In a Sunburned Country"" better. One of the enjoyable things about Bryson's travel books is that it is so easy to disagree with him.What I mean by that is most travel writers are wishy-washy and state things in a neutral, innocuous and boring way. You can always tell what Bryson thinks, and agree or disagree, I like it that way. If you want a vague account of natural beauty or accounts stating some boring museum is ""educational"", this book is not for you.In this book specifically, you get to hear some of Bryson's thoughts on politics and culture in general. He has absorbed a little too much liberal, socialism, but I still enjoy his fine eye for detail.Overall, not his best, but still enjoyable."
4,Great batch of humor.,"I read this book a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Great laughs, well worth the read."
5,Great as almost always,"Bill Bryson in a collection of sydicated newspaper articles is just as enjoyable as he is in his longer works. Quirky, witty, and inventive. Great choice if you only have time to read a few pages a day and nobody in your local paper floats your boat."
3,Wasn't what I expected,"After reading A Walk in the Woods, I picked this book up expecting much of the traveling commentary that was in it and books by Bryson made in the past. Boy, was I wrong. What the book really is, is a compilation of two years' worth of articles written by Bryson, about living in America again. These articles were meant for a British audience and so they do get a bit irritating, things being generalized to the reader that, in America, are well known. These articles may be entertaining, on a weekly basis as they were released, but as a complete read, do get a bit tiresome. This could be said for any article though: try reading a year's worth of Larry King articles, let alone two."
2,"Bryson Light, I found this collection disappointing","Yes there are many humorous observations and bits of irony, however, I found this to have a little too much ""David Barry"" type writing in it. I very much enjoyed his last four travel books. His clever and insightful observations (along with the wonderful dialogues he becomes engaged in) do not work as well in this ""collection of newspaper essays"" format. While reading his other works, I was always sad when they were finished. I was fairly happy when this one ended."
1,Bill Bryson sells his soul for a writer's advance check,"Bill Bryson is a funny writer - but lately he has franchised himself and over extended his abilities. This is a collection of fairly predictable, albeit sometimes funny, newspaper articles he wrote for a local newspaper. Nothing is original and nothing hits home on the mark... it's like your cantankerous uncle came home drunk and started blathering on about nothing."
1,Not that funny,"I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so. He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it. He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics. I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world. All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later. Still lots of people think he is great"
3,Too much America bashing...,Not his best work. He is getting a bit too left leaning but still funny at times.
1,"Contrived, sneering, and worst of all, unfunny","I've never found Bryson as funny as my British friends do, but this book is his worst yet. The ""humor"" felt contrived and his experiences were obviously exaggerated, if not made up from whole cloth. I heard Bryson on PBS awhile back, with his phoney accent and fawning manner in full flow. Bryson is that most loathesome of creatures: the sycophantic, Anglophilic American. I think Mr.""I've always wanted to be a European"" Bryson should pack it back to Yorkshire, where his Uncle Tom act is undoubtedly more appreciated."
2,A reissue of Byson's older essays on America,"I would have given this collection of short essays more stars, but I can't. The publisher is retreading Bryson's earlier work and calling it new and original. It isn't. It appeared years ago.The purpose, of course, is to keep the author in the public eye until he can float his new book on Australia.I recommend all of his earlier books. I especially loved his reading of A Walk in the Woods on audio-tape. The man is perceptive and very funny and sounds exactly like the kind of companion you'd want to spend an evening with in a pub."
4,funny and informative,"Easy and fun to read.This author states facts about the American government and lifestyle in a very comical sense, you would think to yourself ""yes, that's true about American culture"" as you laugh through each chapter."
5,Delightful,"I got this book for Christmas and upon opening the present asked: ""Who's Bill Bryson?"" Well, I know now! He is one of the most delightful writers I have read in a long time, well....ever. This book and a cup of coffee: what a treat! (Don't choke on your coffee if you try it!)"
4,Amusing rants on American life,"I originally bought this book because it was required reading for a class I was taking. We were assigned only the first 17 or so stories and I decided to finish it on my own because it was an enjoyable read overall. Yes, he does have some passages that are more whiny than others, but overall the book has a nice to tone to it. If you're not one to laugh at yourself, you may not enjoy it, but if you enjoy finding humor in simple, everyday situations you often find yourself in then I suggest reading this."
5,"Informative and entertaining, what a great read!",Bill Bryson's I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After 20 Years Away was one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. His observations are entertaining and informative and provided me with many hearty laughs. I highly recommend this title.
5,Bill Bryson is the best travel writer ever!,"I'm a huge fan of travel writing and love to live vicariously through other travelers' writing. This book is slightly different from his other works in terms of the subject. In this book, instead of writing about strange lands and travel, he shares what seems like minute observations that he made upon his return to America after being away for 20 years. The short essays are a pleasure to read and are of a good length for busy readers. I identify with his musings on the American way of life as I am an immigrant myself.Although amusing and comedic, Bryson's observations are also quite astute. Some of stories are also simple and relateable things about his family, which I enjoyed very much. If you're into a well-written, funny, touching and relateable short essays about living in America, this is the book for you!"
5,Hilarious,"This book nails us -- simply put. After buying it, I took it to the gym for light reading while doing cardio exercise, and I have to say, I probably put on five pounds during that period. I simply could not stay on the stairmaster long enough because I was laughing so hard. It's one of those books you take with you everywhere you go, and read even while you're walking to and from places.Enjoy. I sure did."
3,Another brilliant Bryson book!,"Another brilliant Bryson book!This was the second book I've read by Bryson and this time, instead of telling us his stories of far-off places, he makes a place closer to home seem interesting- New England, his new home. It doesn't matter what part of America you live in, you'll still enjoy Bryson's fascination and bewilderment at our way of life, which as changed a lot more than we've guessed in only twenty years. Originally, the stories in the book were published as a weekly newspaper column in England, so it's more a collection of essays rather than a cohesive novel about his experiences. Still, Bryson writes with just enough humor and detail to make each essay seem satisfying. I would have never thought I would enjoy stories about dental floss, car cup holders, and toy shopping with children. Yet, at some points I was laughing out loud. I bet you will too."
2,Not my favorite author in this genre,"I read through about the first third of this offering by Bill Bryson and found I simply could not get into it. Written in the spirit of Dave Barry, Mary Roach and maybe Erma Bombeck, it is intended to draw humor from the little idiosyncrasies of daily American life as seen by an expatriot returned from years in the U.K.Where I find Dave Barry's turns of phrase highly amusing I tend to find Bill's commentary more rankling. Each article highlights some aspect of American life that I find less than satisfying and the commentary, though trying to be amusing, simply comes off as frustrating."
3,Bottom drawer Bryson,"This book is called Notes from a Big Country in Canada, presumably to cash in on the popularity of the author's Notes from a Small Island. This book is not in the same category as its namesake. It is just a collection of reviews written over two years (6 Oct 1996 to 17 May 1998 to be precise) for a British newspaper, offering various gripes about life in America. The book simply reproduces the columns chronologically, and as a result there is no overall organization. The Canadian edition that I read was appallingly poorly copy edited, which is ironic given Bryson's scruples about the English language. Some of the columns are funny, and some (especially one about the sinking of the Titanic) are just plain awful. In sum, this is not nearly as good as Bryson's other books, but still has enough humour to keep you reading to the end."
4,Great fun,"It is hard to know who this book will appeal to more, Americans willing to laugh at themselves or non-Americans wanting to laugh (jealously?) at our friendly neighbours. Actually, i think it will just appeal to people who want to be entertained. A very light-hearted book, with some genuinly hilarious moments. What a change to read an author who doesn't take himself too seriously. Maybe a bit of a con for those Brits who, like myself, religiously read the stories in Night and Day magazine a couple of years ago but still entertaining."
3,Different,Always interesting adventure with Bill. It was different than what I expected. Nice reuse of material but got old after a while.
4,Renamed book. Not happy,Great book but VERY disappointed when I realized I already had it by a different name. I f you aHave Notes from a big island don't buy this book.
3,"Funny, light-hearted, interesting.","Good, light-hearted read. It's difficult for me to laugh out loud from something I read, but I did with this one. Funnier in the beginning than in the end, partly because you start to get used to his writing style and his sometimes outrageous asides lose their element of surprise. Still, it's well worth the money if you're in the mood for funny anecdotes and the occasional comic insight. I recommend it strongly for those who have never read him. Those who are familiar with Bryson (as I was not, but as many of the other customer commentators apparently were) might as well skip it; it's nothing exceptional."
5,He is an American also,"Finish another one of Bill Bryson's books. Full of witty imagination and great reading experience.The message I got from this book is: there are plenty of unsatisfying things in life that you can be cynical about, but still you will love living (in) it.Of course some people don't like (tolerant) being made fun of (with goodwill), even Americans. So they accused of this book not telling the truth, which I would argue that it contains more than most of the printed material, even with Bill's cartoonish exaggeration.That reminded me of a Chinese writer Qian Zhongshu. His novel ""Fortress Besieged"" carried this kind of witty cynical flavor about Chinese society of that (all) times (1930's). I heard that ""Fortress Besieged"" was on the forbidden list by the Chinese government of that time.Since he is also American, Bill Bryson wouldn't be in trouble because of this book, I hope :)"
2,"Whine, whine, whine!","This is a collection of short articles in which the author whines about anything and everything. We all know one of those people. They can complain about anything - too hot, too cold, too rainy, too sunny. At one point, he even complained about other people driving with their windows up! How can that bother someone? Several times, I found myself almost in disbelief that he could complain (or even care) about these things.I would have probably given this book 1 star for the negativity, but he is funny at times, and he had the mercy of making each chapter only a few pages, so the reader only needs to take it in small doses.Ok: I'm done whining about his whining."
4,On the mark,"Once you get past the fact that this book was not written for us on this side of the Atlantic, things will go much smoohter. Bryson is able to make his point in these short articles and makes an impact on almost every one. One regret I do have is that it does seem a bit cheesy to just rehash old articles and compile them in a book, but Bryson thinks so too, (at least he says so at the end), so that helped a little."
2,Not up to his usual standards,"I guess because it is a collection of observations and not as focussed as his other books I lost interest in this one. Without a central theme other than ""How strange America is now"" Bryson's generally on target wit and observations tend to meander from point to point. Viewing America from the perspective of an American who had been away for years is definitely aimed at a British audience who I hope enjoyed it more than I did."
2,Overly exaggerated stories do not equal humor,"The thing that makes stories about everyday minutiae funny is some semblance of believability. Nearly all of the ""anecdotes"" in this book are so exaggerated and unbelievable that they are simply not funny. It is far too easy to exaggerate any situation to make it so ridiculous that it becomes ""humorous"". That is what Mr. Bryson does with most of the stories in this book and it quickly becomes very repetitive and irritating. What is even more annoying is when there are flat out factual inaccuracies used in an attempt to make an already exaggerated situation even more ""humorous"" (Americanos always come with whipped cream?) I was determined to finish the entire book in hopes that things would evolve but this was not the case until the last two stories of the book (No. 69 and 70). To give Mr. Bryson a bit of slack, I've heard that this particular book is not his best one to start off with so I hope to give him a second chance."
2,May have been OK in weekly installments...,"Someone in my book club selected this book for the group to read. It is a compilation of articles written for a weekly newspaper. While I'm sure the articles worked as a weekly supplement, the compilation is... boring. While certainly a talented writer, article after article seemed the same style - flat - and eventually boring. Perhaps more selectivity should have been exercised in picking those articles to be used, rather than just slapping them together into a book. Also - the author's wife is correct - he complains alot!"
4,One of his best,"I thought this was one of Bryson's best......short weekly column type stories on one subject. They were humorous, to the point, and folksy. He does (as he says himself) complain a bit too much, but if there's only one side to the story, it sounds like marketing material instead of a commentary. Enjoyed this one."
4,painfully funny,"So I was reading this book late at night and wound up doubled over with my face in a pillow so I wouldn't wake up the person across the hall with my laughing.This book is insightful (I'm sure I learned things about being American, despite being American), funny, and well-written. The one minus, for me, is that the way he talks about his wife eventually got on my nerves. She comes off as a bit of a 50s-tv-show mom, by turns irrational in her femininity and annoyingly wise. That he refers to her as ""Mrs. Bryson"" doesn't help matters. But that's minor, and maybe if you didn't read it all in one night as I did, it would be less evident. Mostly, this is just a wicked funny book."
4,The sheer silliness of being American,"Laugh-out-loud hilarious. Bryson's observations about American society and its absurdities rings so true and the author is the perfect vehicle for showcasing these stories. He is just so lovable in his books. His absentmindedness and his sharp wit both serve him extremely well. While poking fun at others, he also pokes fun at himself. His work is just priceless."
4,"Good, but not as good as his others","The short-essay format does not suit Bill Bryson's talents. Just as each chapter gets going, it's time to end, and most chapters end in a formulistic way, referring back to a comment near the beginning. Some chapters still had me laughing out loud, especially in the back half of the book. I've given his other travel books 5 stars, but can give this one ""only"" 4. Wait for the paperback (sorry, Bill)."
3,Okay but no Walk in the Woods,"This is a collection of short essays on various topics such as going to the barber shop and the number of cupholders in cars. While some are funny, some seem a bit contrived and other seem to be forced. The essays jump around with no continuity. Not a bad read but not a great one either."
4,Yes! I am not alone!,"Having spent two years in the US of A recently, I found myself puzzeling repeatedly over the quirks and contradictions of our BIG SISTER. Now, FINALLY, we are NOT alone.Every single column in Bryson's brilliant flare describes actual daily happenings. I will testify before any court. IT IS SO.How could the most influencial of democracies survive when its individuals are totally devoid of the burden of general knowledge, so often lack wit, and do not have any capacity for taking responsibility? repeatedly relating anecdotes of our stay in New England, we found our listeners wearing unbelieving and bemuzed expression.Of course, generalization is silly. Among the 275 million Americans there are witty entrepeneurs with insight and distinction. I'm sure. It is my suspicion, though, that for the most, these qualifications have been outsourced....M. Beeri, MDIsrael"
5,Best algae wafers,"I have five fish tanks. I really like bottom feeders and have a tank of cory cats and a tank of loaches. There's a 10 year old pleco in with the loaches. I also have a tank with two green spotted puffers. To feed the puffers, I have a tank with snails. The snails have to eat and I feed them algae wafers. I also feed my cory cats some of these wafers in addition to flakes and sinking pellets. The pleco and loaches also get some of these wafers. Because I can get these wafers bulk, they are cheaper than any other algae wafers. I live in dry climate and the last bag lasted me two years. These are great algae wafers!"
3,bad string,"I received the Rotosound 77 jazz bass strings. Got them in a timely matter no trouble there. The problem is that the ""D"" string is dead. A thuddy sound instead of nice clear tone. I use these strings a lot and this is the first time anything like this has happened. What now?? I feel cheated because the string is not right. It is the .60 string on the 40-60-80-100 set of flat-woundRotosound SM77 Monel Flatwound Hybrid Bass Guitar Strings (40 60 80 100). I guess I will just use it, practice only for now, then after some time when needed, put the other set on and see what happens there. I bought 2 sets of course. Hmmm, disappointed."
2,Very basic overview of the subject,"If you already have *any* experience in programming asp.net then you can disregard over half of this book. Three out of nine chapters deal only with asp.net code that you can pick up from any book and many websites.Chapter 2: ASP.NetChapter 3: Programming in Visual Basic .NETChapter 5: Web Forms, Web Controls, and Web TemplatesAs for the ArcGIS Server parts of this book, the only topics they cover are using basic templates that ESRI provides in its Developer's help. One of their examples comes straight from ESRI documentation.You can teach yourself a ton more just by exploring the forums on ESRI's website, the developer help, and playing with the sample web apps that come with the software.Don't waste your money on this book. In fact, if you are an EDN subscriber (ESRI Developer's Network) then you will get an electronic copy of a book that is over 700 pages long that will cover everything in this book and tons more."
4,Lots of magnets,The magnets are great. Not much guided activities though. I would have liked to have some lessons to work with my 8-yo. Don't store this near your computer. :)
5,Insightful & Perceptive,"This book has received far less attention than it deserves, in my opinion. I came across this book quite by accident in the library, & was very surprised to see it - I hadn't even know it existed! Blanche Howard is a wonderful writer! She writes with great perception & enthusiasm about one woman's experiences as she ages, struggling to maintain her independence, her health & emotional ties, & to experience fully the challenges & joys of daily living. It is deeply insightful & speaks to everywoman's experience as she enters the age where she becomes, in society's eyes, so much less visible. Howard explores the rich & colourful inner life of this woman. Excellent!"
1,Worst of the Worst,Horrible Horrible! If you want to fail the LSAT BUY THIS BOOK! The practice tests have so many incorrect answers I doubt very much that the author could get into an accredited law school.
3,"Definitely not ""LSAT for Dummies""","I am not a law student, and I don't think I will be with this book. Maybe I should say that I am not pre-law. I have no prior understanding of law, except what I've seen on TV, which is totally accurate, I'm sure. If you're like me and you have no knowledge of law, you might want to get the Princeton Review book, instead.I went to my library and started reading it and found it much more helpful. This book reads like a computer manual. I will use it for the practice tests that come with it, but I think for advice on the LSAT I will go back to my library and study the Princeton Review one. And no, I don't work for them, in case that's what you're thinking.If you are good at reading computer manuals or law jargon, then this book should be great for you!"
5,Great to keep everything in order!,"We use this with a 2 inch Avery binder to keep all our finances and household affairs in order. The tabs are great to quickly customize categories that need to be specific. More useful than pre-printed tabs that just say BANK, HOME, AUTO, etc. Very easy to set up, print and use."
4,Get organized,"Great tool to get your life, school work or business organized. The two-sided slant binder pockets are perfect for storing your household bills, organizing your classes and school work or creating polished presentations, proposals, legal documents and more. I even use these to organize upcoming trips placing my itinerary, ticket information, and car rental and hotel reservation information to help keep me organized.The pack includes one package of Index Maker dividers (5 tabs per set, 5 sets in the package) plus a 1.5 inch Avery Heavy Duty Binder. Easy Apply Label Sheet lets you label all tabs at once. Index Maker dividers included are for use in 3-ring binders, but unpunched Index Maker dividers can be purchased for use with binding machines.The quality of the product is good."
1,Smudged w Laser Printer,"After printing with my HP Color LaserJet 4600, the labels smudged. Exactly, what I didnt want b/c I used them to create binders for the company that I work for. The selling point for me was that I no longer had to have my chicken scratch handwriting on the tabs of my business's binder tabs.Also, I felt that the labels were not easy to apply at all! It was time consuming and frustrating, especially if I didn't place them down perfectly straight on my first attempt to stick the labels."
3,Handy but Not Necessary,"The product is good quality and the idea pretty handy. But adding labels individually to a tab is not really that stressful for me.I would like to see the dividers made out of thicker paper or a cardstock. I use these kinds of dividers at work and flipping through them on a daily basis wears them out very quickly. The 3 ring binder with the labels is a nice addition and fairly stout and should last a while.If you like the idea of printing your labels out and applying them in a strip, this product will work."
3,"Neat, but not exactly necessary","I didn't really have a chance to use this binder/tab combo until very recently in a new office, so I am just getting around to reviewing them. I didn't read the description well enough, so I was pleasantly surprised that the tabs came with a binder (a nice binder, too!).The peel-off feature is pretty cool, and overall, I do like the product. I personally didn't find it that much of a shortcut or ""life changer,"" but I think anyone with bad or questionable penmanship will get great use out of it."
2,"""Easy apply strip"" just a pain","I am not impressed. Sure, if you manage to get it just right, your tabs will look gorgeous. But it is SO difficult to get right! I wouldn't recommend these tabs...old school dividers with tabs that you can either write on or print out label for are MUCH easier and more practical for most uses."
1,Didn't work for my needs,"To use this product, first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing, but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again, another time drain. In my case, the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder, making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs, which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
5,"Sturdy, with rubber-covered push tab that makes the ring easier to open and close...","You can count on Avery to bring to market an excellent heavy-duty three-ring binder that can be depended upon to be easy-to-manipulate and hold-up to the abuse inherent in office work.I particularly like the plastic cover over the push tab to use open-and-close the rings to place the dividers and paper in. With free templates and software to make the index tab dividers and a study 3-ring binder to put materials in this is a good, solid, dependable product. The rings themselves appear to match up perfectly.Bottom line? Buy this heavy duty 3-ring binder you won't have to struggle ever again to open and close the rings like you do on most."
4,Time saver for a busy office,"I'm not exactly sure what I am reviewing, since Avery sent a special kit to the Vine reviewers that consisted of a 1.5"" Heavy-Duty One Touch EZD 3-ring binder and the tabs.The EZD binder is made very well, with an easy to use ring locker.The Easy Apply tabs come in strips of 5 that allow you to label 5 tabs in one fast stroke, perfect for the office commandos that need to file stuff on a daily basis. The kit also comes with a tab sheet that allows you to print tabs using a Word template. All of these tabs are self-adhesive, so it saves you time from having to hunt down lost inserts.Avery comes up with nifty ways of organizing information and this is not an exception."
5,Great product,"This is a really nice addition to a filing system. The tabs are easy to use and they look so nice in the file. The added bonus of the binder was neat, I didn't expect that."
2,Look at the picture,"Look at the product description. I thought I was ordering what is in the picture. Suffice to say, I was disappointed when I saw my actual product."
2,Six sigma or Six histories ?,"It seemed interesting in the beginning, but my interest was not to read a pile of ideas that they have gained (the companies like Ge, etc), but like really implementing it and really disillusioned me."
2,"How many, how many and who.","I FELT YOUR BOOK WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AND VERY INTERESTING AND REALLY MOTIVATED ME TO START A BUSINESS USING THIS MGT STYLE.BUT, YOU DID NOT ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS I NEED TO KNOW 1. HOW MANY BUSINESSES OR COMPANIES ARE USING SIX SIGMA IN THE UNITED STATES? AND HOW MANY AROUND THE WORLD? 2. CAN YOU JUSTIFY OR PROVE THAT THESE BUSINESSES OR COMPANIES ARE USING SIX SIGMA STYLE."
2,"Better Title, ""Come to the Six Sigma Academy!""","I first ordered and read this book when I was just beginning my journey down statistics and the Six Sigma Quality initiative training. Back then, I would have rated this book a 4 or a 5. But as my learning grows, so does my dissappointment in this book. If you have no knowledge of Six Sigma whatsoever, here's a heads up: ""THIS BOOK IS JUST AN ADVERTISEMENT."" I found ""The Six Sigma Way"" by Peter Pande a much better written, much more meaty book that has something for you no matter where on the scale of understanding you are. Not to slam too hard on the superficial content of this book, I have been told that Mikel Harry has written some better books in greater detail on the Six Sigma process but right now I'm afraid to shell out bigger bucks to have bigger dissappointments."
2,Where's the beef?,"I agree with the complaints of many of the other reviewers of this book. I believe that Six Sigma truly is a powerful industrial/business tool. Unfortunately this book reads like it was designed as a brochure for managers considering implementation of quality control programs for their companies. There are some basic Six Sigma tenets outlined, but in disappointingly little depth. It was especially frustrating to wade through all of the RAH-RAH name-dropping of corporations and CEOs to get to any real information. I did not expect to be a 'black belt' when I finished this book, but all I really came away with was a cursory introduction to the Six Sigma approach and the sense that I had just been delivered a thinly veiled sales pitch."
3,Close but no cigar,"Yes, we all know about the high profile cases, ala GE, but the key issues where the book falls short, as most panacea books do, are examples of how 6 Sig works or doesn't work in knowledge based functions where low volume and high judgment prevail, and a step-by-step,amply annotated plan for applying 6 Sig to these types of processes. In the end, how TRULY different/better is it than standard process analysis and cost reduction methods? I suggest interested parties start with a review of the basic principles laid out in The Process Edge by Peter Keen. Follow that with Rummer and Bache on Improving Performance and you will be ahead of the game."
2,Six Sigma and the Industrial Engineer,"The book gives a good general overview of the Six Sigma system. It offers little real ability to do projects UNLESS you are an industrial engineer (IE), in which case it gives you a concrete case to sell your solutions to management. Six Sigma appears to be a buzz word for PART of an indutrial engineers repitoire of skills. ..."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,This is a poorly written 300 page piece of marketing fluff for the Six Sigma Academy consulting group. Either save your time by skipping the book and contacting the consultants directly or find a different book if you really want to learn about six sigma
1,P. T. Barnum would be proud...,"How many times, and in how many ways, can we ""discover"" or ""invent"" the radical concept that doing well what you do every day tends to produce success? For people who go to sleep at night with phrases like ""market share"" and ""profit margin"" dancing about in their heads, this book may seem helpful. One cannot help but wonder, however, what would happen to quality and productivity if the time, money, effort, and energy devoted to ingesting this sort of thing were instead pumped into attending to the job at hand. One saving grace: There are people who still don't get it, and this book just might make a dent in their thick skulls."
1,Non Ecological,The authors used more than two hundred pages describing what can be written in ten. At least they could had saved some trees... It would be better classified as a business romance.
1,Don't waste your time.,Book lacks any indepth discussion. It's an article stretched into a book.Jack Welch's quote is misleading. He is not talking about this book.
2,Six Sigma or Six Figures?,"The book sounds fine in principle, but I read it with interest having lived through a Six Sigma project or two.. Just as Marx's philosophy's were twisted by Lenin and Stalin, so is Six Sigma by the leaders of today's business. It becomes a fancy name for cost cutting and bureaucratic nightmares."
1,Regret to buy this book,"Talks a lot on how good Six Sigma is, but after reading the whole book, I have no idea of exactly what Six Sigma Breakthrough Strategy is. Maybe I need to pay for their consultancy service to learn this."
3,"Good start, but where's the beef","This is six sigma 101. Does a nice job of getting you 'in the game' but is really lacking depth. Good only for the novice.Goes a little to far in praise of Jack Welch. I wanted a book on Six Sigma, if I wanted a book on GE, I would have bought one on GE."
2,Six Sigma - Uninspired Reading,"This book had some interesting concepts, but wasn't written well. For such commonly used concepts and well-known themes, I am somewhat surprised. Didn't like the book much."
1,Free Advertisement,"From my prespective, readers who purchase a book on Six Sigma are somehow experienced on Quality processes and want to learn more on the topic. However, this book is a total dissapointemet, as it is more of advertisement than knowlege. The author could have written ten pages to describe what was said on 281 pages! All that was written were Black Belts, how vital were they to the process. No emphasis on the Six Segma process, no description of the mechanism from an engineering prespective. It is more of 'Six Segma is the best and we can deliver the impossible' approach! For me this could be a good Novel to read, not for serious Managers."
1,To be expected,"Not surprised, but disappointed. This book is what is to be expected from a group of people who have a good understanding of concepts but no understanding of application. No detail and no meat toward the important aspects of actual implementation.May be ok for a first exposure to the concepts of Six Sigma, but don't expect to learn anything about how it really works or about how to fit it into your organizations culture."
2,Nice but little meat,"The authors present some good information, particularly the success stories at GE and other selected companies. They outline the general six sigma steps and the roles of the green belt, black belts and other players in the six sigma methodology.However, upon close reading, the book is poorly written and has apparent self contraditions. There is not much meat in the book. For what they covered, the book could have condensed to 30-50 pages.They leave many questions unaswered -- you may have to hire them to help you implement six sigma.In summary, it is worth a quick glance but do not read closely. It is a book on six sigma written at the minus 1.7 sigma level, in my opinion anyway.P.S. I am not panning six sigma; it is a fairly good system and i like how it is tied to the customer and financials of a company -- something other approaches have assumed, but did not stress.You can reach the reviewer at doestat@yahoo.com"
1,Product does not work....read the review on Amazon and Costco,"The product does not work. We have a large family and ski extensively. I purchase a sizable amount of these type of warmer products each ski season. Many of them work great. This brand does not work period. It is difficult finding out the product does not work when you are out in the cold and expecting it to perform. I would go so far as to say this product is dangerous. Obviously reading the reviews after the fact, I realized that many people have the same experience and I hope one more posting will help others from making our mistake. I would strongly suggest you purchase another brand. We have had great success with Thunder Bay, Hot Hands, and Grabber brand. Basically, any brand other than this. You will also find the company does not provide any customer service follow up. I am a little surprised both Costco and Amazon still carry the brand."
1,Litttle hotties toe warmers and hand warmers,"I just started an outdoor job 2 weeks ago, living in New Jersey can get pretty cold sometimes . I made a special trip to Costco to purchase the Little Hotties toe warmers and hand warmers, I tried them for 3 days and the heat never kicked in, I tried the grab warmers and they worked like a charm , more expensive but they worked . The old saying is true you get what you pay for."
1,little hotties warmers,Bought a box of 40.the expiry date is 2015these do not heat at all.don't waste your money.
1,Little Hotties,The hand warmers barely get warm. Much less than other brands I have used. I would not buy again for sure.
1,"Horrible, don't get hot or even warm....barely any heat",I'm giving these back to Costco and ordered the brand that I've purchased in the past from Amazon....Hot Hands 2. These little hotties are a joke. My bad for even considering the switch to these.
5,Little Hotties Hand Warmers,Excellent item to have when elk hunting in the snow to keep your fingers warm. I will not be without them. They really do last 5 hours.
1,These suck,"They really don't get very warm and they warmth DOES NOT LAST AS LONG AS advertised! Be warned! I got them because they were cheaper than the Grabber Hand Warmers, by like a dollar or so for the box. I regret that since, even the EXPIRED Grabbers were hotter and lasted longer than these cheapies. Never again!"
2,changed,"I've used these for a couple of years and been very happy, but something has changed. I use them in my right sock because for some reason toes on that foot get cold, and in the past, I've removed them after 8 hours and they were still warm, but the warmers in this recent purchase don't get near as warm and are cool in just a couple of hours! I see they are made in China. Back to HotHands toe warmers....they are made in USA. They don't last more then a few hours, but at least they get warm!"
4,Great hand warmers,"good product,although a few packets are rock hard and unusable. Hotties are still the best hand warmers I have found."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I spend a lot of time outdoors, both for work and pleasure. My husband ordered a case of these, sadly seduced by the low price. THEY ARE A COMPLETE WASTE. After shaking them up as directed and waiting at least an hour, they seemed to be lukewarm. He pulled out his infra-red thermometer (He says to say it's a Fluke brand, ""so they know it's accurate""), and the temperature is 92 degrees. So my body at 98 degrees is actually heating the Little Hottie... Update: it's now an hour and a half since shaking, and the temperature of the Little Hotties is actually going down rather than up... 83 degrees and dropping..."
2,"Good songs, but, again, remakes","OK, if you're just looking at the cover of this CD in your local store, or online, you think you're getting eight Merle Haggard classics, but, be warned, these are the same ""sound-alike"" remakes that are on the ""For The Record"" collection. These recordings were actually recorded in 1995 to round out the ""Super Hits"" cds Haggard made for CBS, and while they are pretty good, they are far inferior to the original Capitol and MCA recordings of these songs.If you're looking for a good budget Haggard CD, go for the Best of the Best of Merle Haggard on Capitol. Don't waste your time on these remakes."
5,Living Colour continues to collide ideas,"It was worth 10 years for...it has a little bit of everything, but its coherent. The reggae to hard rock of ""Nighmare City"" has hints of Bad Brains, the cover of the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" might even surpass the original, the playing is super tight, the songs well crafted. The only medicore parts are the campy version of ""Back in Black"" and the almost too-indie ""Operation Mind Control"". This is a great live band (one of the best) that is finally getting closer to their live sound on record."
2,How the mighty have fallen,"Not total drek, but as a long time admirer of the band and the men in it, this wasn't worth waiting year for, let alone ten. I've got somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 LC CDs in varying types of promos, imports, live recordings, etc., and this wins out as the worst single CD of the entire bunch. There are a couple of gems (""Flying"" strikes me as one of the best songs of recent memory), but there was little grab upon first listen and even less after my 40th. I don't have a problem with the covers as some do (I love their rips in years past through ""Should I Stay or Should I Go?"", ""Sailin' On"", and ""The Ocean"", amongst others), but even the covers seem forced. I know these four can do better work. Even ""Sacred Ground"", a needless repeat from the greatest hits CD of 7 or so years ago, sounded better the first time around. I just hope this is the accidental b-sides album and the real Living Colour ""new"" album will be out soon."
1,Music Fan,"This is what We waited for?!Mailed in performances, covered up by garage band distortion.My only problem is not reading more than just the first few reviews!Because I can't figure out what alot of people see in this recording.Not only is there no power in the writing,It's sonic crap!And I think a lot of bands these days have proven you can make distortion work.This stuff just reminds me thier trying to hide something.And I dont know who the early bass players were , but GET THEM BACK!I remember Living Colour to be a cross between George Clinton and Jimi Hendrix.Now it's Play that Funky Music White Boy!"
4,LEGEND RETURNS!,"STAIN has been in my CD players rotation now for the last 10 years! No joke. A masterpiece of a recording that manages to alwayts sound fresh and current. Masterpiece for sure. When i heard LC were coming out with a new release I had my fingers crossed. Now I have to say it is no STAIN but very good non the less. Their sound is different. A great experiment by Vernon and the rest of the guys. I cant argue with it. They wanted a unique sound that set them apart from the sound we are hearing today and it works. (Ala Smashing Pumkins with their sound on Siamese Dream) Song wise, LC retain the dark edge from STAIN and pull a few musical inventions along the way. All in all a STAIN is a 10 where this release is an 8.5. Still not bad at all. I can only imagine this CD getting up to a 10 with time."
4,It's Living Colour 'Nuff Said,"As a longtime fan of LC I listened to this cd without the expectations of""it better be as good as Vivid"" and it isn't.What it is is more good work from the band as they continued to grow and experiment with their music.You have to appreciate the work of these guys in their present state and not judge everything against their first landmark cd.It also must be listened to a few times to appreciate just how good a band LC is(hopefully not was,as I hope there will be some future releases).The more I listen to this cd and others they have released I continuously find songs that I get to really like.I think this is true of most artists out there that not everything they release is going to be your favorite but you can find some good music to listen to.Open eyes, open ears will set you free!"
2,high hopes - dashed...,"I've always considered myself a fan of Living Colour because they've been quite impressive with each release. This album, however, seems hurried and doesn't seem to be recorded all that well either. Sometimes I can't even hear the bass! Most of the songs lack the lyrical depth and emotion of ealier recordings - and most also seem to repeat themselves too much. Living Colour's earlier recordings never had this problem - so it's quite a stunner. Vernon is great as is Calhoun but for the rest - Grrrr... Perhaps more time should've been spent on the material. AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" is great but then they re-record ""Sacred Ground"" and ruin it in the process. It hurts me to say these things, really. I mean to go from albums like ""Times Up"" to this is working backwards... - Still a great band to see live though...Only buy this album if you're a hard core fan. Most of the songs are duds unfortunately... Man, I hate to say that too... Grrrr!"
2,not worth the wait,"I Grew up on these Brothers Who Rocked Hard&were a Cool band back in the day.""Cult of Personality"",""Glamour Boys"" etc.. they vibed Funk Metal&were on point.but this Album seems forced&Contrived in so many spots.they could do this as a EP or something.I've seen many Bands come along who couldn't carry Living Color's Luggage.but this Album is just kida there worth the wait."
1,Not worth the wait,"What a disappointment. There is the old saying the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but, in the case of Living Colour right now, the whole is much much less. Vernon is the greatest living guitarist, period. Corey is tremendous singer, avoid buying this album or sell it and buy his solo album Hymns instead. Doug Wimbish is an amazing musician, and Will is a damn fine drummer, which makes it all the more confounding that they produced this dog after such a long layoff. The lyrics are terrible, and the music is worse. The only thing worth listening to are the two covers, and that is sad. I hope they try again, but, until then, I'll just listen to the first two albums and hope they get it together."
2,Vernon plays heavy!,"But I can't stand the CD. There is not one song that makes me want to play this again. I understand that after soooo much time off they needed to change a little. I just can't get into it. I dig how heavy Vernon's guitar is but the songs just don't work for me. I hate the ""Back in Black"" cover, Yikes Corey!At first I thought it was a joke. Then I realized that this is serious. Why the cover songs? Cuz, there tain't nothin worth playing on the radio. So they turned to covers songs to try and reach the masses. And what is with all the electronic noises and crazy rythyms. Guitar, Bass Guitar, Drums, Vocals. That is all you need in this band. No Sequencers!Anyhow, keep putting out new CD's. Perhaps the next one will be better.Good to have you back."
2,Be careful what you wish for.,"First off, I've been a LC fan from day one. I've always considered them my favorite band. Vivid blew my mind, Time's up made me re examine what I called music and Stain like the other two was a masterpiece. Since the day I heard of them parting I always wondered what the next CD would have been like. Because every album before was so amazing and different.Well I ordered this CD from Amazon UK because I wanted to hear it ASAP. I went home and like I did for Time's up and Stain, I sat alone in front of my stereo to experience the new LC CD. How do I describe this record? BORING and CONTRIVED. I wanted to like this record, Will is asleep at the wheel, Corey sounds very uninspired. The whole album sounds like they're going through the motions. Where's the fire?"
2,2 stars simply because they 'used to be...',"I was excited. I loved these guys. Still do. But I don't love them for this. I've had it since it came out and keep putting it on to see if it will hit me differently. It doesn't.Frankly, anyone who can seriously do a cover of AC/DC (and a truly poor cover at that) is just not trying anymore. Even the production was bad.I'm sorry guys, time's up."
2,And i USED to be a die-hard fan!,"All i could do with most of the tracks on this album was shake my head. What a JOKE! I'm down for the cause and will always check out new material from Living Coulour. But i gotta say..i was hugely dissapointed. Oh..don't get me wrong. The (Back in Black) cover was pretty good. And (Flying) is pure inspirational genious. Just Beautiful. But the rest of the album made me want to use the disc as a coaster for my drink. I was especially dissapointed with the Beatles cover..(Tomorrow Never Knows). Now, if a quartet of brotha's can't get that song to come out soundin'as funky as the Beatles did, well....Nuff said. Get back in the woodshed guys. i want something on the level of the first two Living Colour albums. Got it?"
3,"Somewhat dissapointing, but some good stuff in there","AFter putting out the masterpiece Stain, the boys have gotten back after a 10+ year absence for a new album.Considering what has happened since then, the boys still got it, but considering their past grand history, the album does have let downs in places.Essentially the album is more stripped down, but along with some good tracks there are some duds. They still manage to have highlights in songs like 'A ? of when' , 'Flying' , 'Nightmare City' and 'Tomorrow Never Knows', but then there are tracks that make you wonder what happened? such as 'Operation: Mind Control', 'choices Mash Up', and 'In Your Name'. Some experimentation gone awry, but some of it also works out beautifully.Not all is lost, and at least there is something to salvage, but considering their past greatness (I can't think of a single bad living Colour song until I heard this album) this album seems like a dissapointment.Maybe 2.5 stars. Enjoy!!"
5,A Truly Welcome Return,"It's been 10 long years since Living Colour's last full-length studio album, and Collideoscope was certainly worth the wait. The songs are powerful and emotional, many of them dealing with life in a post-9/11 world (if the lyrics to Flying don't move you, you may want to do some literal soul-searching). Fans of intelligent song-writing and talented musicianship will want to pick this up ASAP. The rest of you can be content with the latest disaster from Lumpy Bisquick or whatever Fred Durst's ""band"" is called..."
3,A little let down.,"I was sooo ready to love this album. But, it's just not happening. The album seems to be all over the place. It seems to be half Glover solo album and half LC. LC has always been very experimental in the past, but this is different. I can't put my hand on it, but it's just not the LC of old. Believe me, I used to be a diehard fan. Stain in still one of my favorite albums of all time. Burnin Vernon is still burnin on this album, but is just seems to ""produced"" or maybe ""canned"" would be a better word. The first time I listened to it, I hated it. Now that I have listed to it a few times, I have found a few songs to like, but that about it. Normally, I would give an album like this 1 or 2 stars, but LC has earned 3 stars just for making a comeback.Jim."
2,I want to like this but...,"I couldnt wait for this recording to be released. Im a huge L.C. fan(have the cd's & seen them live many times) but boy is this one way off! They had nearly a decade to write this one and it sounds like the Stain leftovers.Back in Black: Yes, your black and your back but the song is painfully out of reach for Corey.Tomorrow Never Knows: did away with the groove!Operation mind control: Worst L.C. song ever?Not a hook to be had in remaining songs and overall the recording is muffled, open it up and let it fly!. Less techno experiments and more Bad Brains influence.When the band first came out they were touted as having the ""Best Rhythm Section"" in rock. Now Vernon seems content on sitting on power chords and playing with drum machines. They sound bored.I still plan on seeing them live when they come to town and hope that this is just a phase."
3,Lost in Delivery,"Dennis is one of my favorite comedians, which is why I rated this work so highly. The cover says ""Read by the Author"" and that's what he does, he reads. Not in the fiery tongue of his TV monologues but like he was reading a bedtime story on a night when he felt under the weather. And some of the material was previously released. At least 3 of the bits are in ""Rants"". And the jazzy musical interludes between bits is not preferable to dead silence. But he makes you think, and sometimes go look up stuff, which is why I like him."
3,a good read but not my favorite Amanda Quick,Liked that fact that Emma is a paid companion but she seems awfully dense for a woman who was intelligent enough to make an investment to increase her inheritance. Didn't think she would be the type to succumb to Edison so quickly. Characters seemed oddly 2 dimensional and plot too much like a formula. Not a lot of PASSION. Enjoyed but not Jayne's best effort.
2,Definitely not her best work,"I am a huge Krentz/Quick/Castle fan, but I was very disappointed with ""I Thee Wed."" The characters didn't keep my interest. I actually didn't really feel compelled to see them come together. Not the usual sparks I expected, and I had the ending figured out about half way through the book. I think it's time I went back and re-read the Quick classics!! This is probably one of the first Quick books that I didn't read in one sitting. I kept falling asleep!"
3,A fun light read,"While I enjoyed the book, it was not a favorite. The beginning is interesting with the characters meeting while hiding entangled in a wardrobe. Edison Stokes is charming, eccentric and has some witty lines. Emma, on the other hand, is just down right annoying. All she seems to ever talk about is needing money and references, and for the life of me I cannot figure out what about her Edison likes. She is stubborn, bossy, and all about herself and her post. She does not possess too many redeeming character traits. Most of her comments I found grating. I do like how Emma handles Edison's grandmother and the grandmother's role in the story. There were a few funny moments, but overall, I think the book was merely average and that Emma's character developed poorly. The love interest was weak and the Vanza scheme was weak. But it was an easy read and interesting enough for me to finish the book."
5,JAK just cracks me up!,This book spends much time explaining Vanzagara that was touched on in the last book. Edison is searching for a book that was stolen from the Vanzagarian library. A chemist that specializes in Vanzagarian herbs has been murdered. A lady no one has met prior to this season is pushing tea down everyone's throats and asking them to guess which card is in her hand. It really is a fun book - intriguing and difficult to put down!
4,A real page-turner!,"Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down. The conversaton kept you moving through it. The twist in the end was great. The only thing I didn't like was some of it was a bit predictable. Ohterwise a great read."
5,"Great Characters, enjoyable story","I was prepared to be disappointed with the book after reading some of the reviews but was very pleasantly surprised to find that I throughly enjoyed it. I loved Emma who was funny and never at a loss for a witty repartee. She was, like most of Quick's heroines, a practical and self-sufficient person but not quite as quirky as some and therefore more believable. Edison was also a refreshing change from Quick's usual brooding, mysterious heroes and I liked his character. The interaction between the 2 main characters kept the story going along nicely."
4,A good one of Ms.Quick's,I am very fond of this particuarly book of hers I though it was very cool. I love Edison he has got to be one of her better male characters. I found the whole book to be quite good and interesting. I recommened it to anyone who just wants a good book full of suprises.
4,To Have and To Hold...,"Charming story of a paid companion finding herself engaged and working for a wealthy and powerful member of the Ton. As they combine their abilities to track down a missing ancient book and secret recipe for an elixir, they have some exciting adventures along the path to true love. Perfect for light reading and escape. It is both interesting and easy to read, requring no special effort from the reader to suspend disbelief."
3,I Thee Wed,I hadn't read a Amanda Quick novel in a few years but decided to give this one a try. I won't be reading another of hers anytime soon. It seemed like the plot was stuck in one place and didnt EVER go anywhere. Frankly I was disappointed. Guess I'll stick with some other authors who can actually write a story that has more than one theme.
4,Read books based on your likes and dislikes!!!!,"I liked this book. I own 2 of AQ's books, read about 5 total. So far I have not been dissappointed. I liked this book, and I am very ticky about my reading materials. Granted this was something totally different from my Sandra Brown (romance) and my Perry Mason & Murder She Wrote Mysteries, it was still a good read."
3,I Thee Wed,"I Thee Wed, being a Quick novel, was still enjoyable for a one-time-read. It truly does not measure up to her older works, but is worth at least a read-through."
3,CAN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN THIS.....,"Thank goodness I borrowed it from my library. I believe this is the only QUICK title I will not have sitting on my keeper-shelf. Whatever happened to the used-to-be witty sparring between the hero & heroine ? I always giggled & sighed over the intelligent plot & the charming characters of her previous books -- which were all marvelously-written thank U very much -- after I read 'em. I also re-read 'em all from time to time. Sadly this one really missed the mark by 10,000 feet. I found myself skipping over some pages just to get to the finish line sooner. Next time, I'll also pre-screen her upcoming novel from the library....."
4,A great read..,I just loved this book. It was my first AQ book. (I usually read just JAK) I couldn't put it down. I felt that it kept you guessing and I loved both of the main characters..
4,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Read,"I have recently started reading Amanda Quick and although I found this book a very good read. However, the book did tend to dragged in a few spots. I did thoroughly enjoy Emma's spunk and ability to speak her own mind. I also enjoyed the bit of mystery mixed into the plot, even though some of it was a bit predictable. It was also not completely realistic, however, I found many scenes extremely humorous and over all the book managed to captivate my attention. I thouroughly enjoyed it. I would reccomend it to anyone who enjoyed ""With This Ring""."
3,Not the usual,"After buying my first Amanda Quick book, I was hooked and now own all of them but I find that with each book that comes out, it's starting to get very formulaic and I could interchange the characters in each book. Come on Amanda, I know you can do better than that. I found this book lacked the usual chemistry and intensity that the first few books had but I'll still wait for the next one to come out and hope that things will improve."
4,OUT OF THE ORDINARY!,"I got really burned out on romance novels for a while because they all seemed the same.I am really glad I took someone's suggestion and tried this book. There was more exicetment than in most romance novels, and the charachters were the best and most original charachters I have seen in a long time.If you want an easy read that is suspensefull and makes you smile, then this is the book to get."
2,Very disappointing,"What in the world has happened to Amanda Quick ? I was hoping that the somewhat disappointing ""With This Ring"" was simply an anomaly, but ""I Thee Wed"" doesn't even give the reader characters to cheer for. Emma is charming, but we don't really get to know her well enough for her to be compelling. Edison seems to made of cardboard...stiff, unsympathetic and boring. I made the mistake of buying the hardcover edition of this book, but I will not make that mistake with Ms. Quick again. The earlier novels, although formulaic, were filled with great eccentric characters and satisfying plots. This book is not even worth checking out from the library. Sorry, Amanda Quick, but have you taken a sabbatical or something ?"
2,Ick Quick,I had to force myself to finish this. It was my second and probably last Quick book. Emma and Edison were quite boring characters. The drawn-out mystery was over-done and covered up any romance. The romance scences weren't really too romantic. The Vengaraza stuff wasn't too imaginative.
2,I Thee Wed,I had to force myself to finish this one. Edison and Emma lacked any character to keep the reader interested in what happened to them.
3,I Thee Wed--Not a Work to Stand Out,"Good plot. The characters are likeable enough. Many times I felt that the author forgot that she was writing a romance at all. The romance is decidedly second to the mystery. I didn't find the conclusion particualarly believeable. This is not a bad book, but there's nothing that makes it stand out from any other Amanda Quick novel. Those of you who know her works like I do are probably pondering the same question that I am. What does she have against beds? If she thinks they're mundane, then she must know that, after a dozen books, so is the now predictable love scene in the carriage."
2,What a letdown!,"I am a fan of Amanda Quick's historicals - ""Ravished"" is an alltime favorite. However. . . This story is a letdown. The characters are hard to like or even care about, Quick's trademark humor is missing, and the supposed chemistry between the couple is not believable. I wish I'd never read this book, rather than be so disappointed with her latest (paperback) effort."
1,Big Dissapointment,"This book was not worthy of finishing! I started it at the beginning of a five hour plane trip and actually stopped after an hour, never to pick it up again. The characters were poorly drawn and utterly unlikable. As for chemistry, forget about it. Amanda Quick has lost her way with this one."
3,Not What I Expected,"I was disappointed that the characters weren't fully developed. It was almost like the storyline competed with the characters instead of having the two blend together as a successful novel. I guess this book was okay, but it surely wasn't what I expected."
1,I could barely finish it.,This book unfortunately lacked the spark that her prev. books had contained. The main charachters lacked that certain chemistry. In all it was a disappointment. If you want to read an Amanda Quick book read another one besides this one.
2,Formulaic,"This book follows a very predictable formula, and therefore, offers no real insights. Here is the Formula:1. Terminally ill doctor (the doctor part is important to the plot) sets out on a journey to end his life.2. It is necessary that the author gets him out of his car so he can interact with other people. So there is a car wreck.3. The assorted people he runs into once he has been extracted from his isolated car, of course, offer him Things to Consider and A Reason to Live.4. End of story.The doctor part is necessary because that enables him to do noble, helpful things for his Fellow Man (or Woman), including delivering a baby. This presumably shows him there is still a role for him in life, however long it is.Ho hum. If only life were really this neat and provided such handy packaged answers to our despair."
2,Boring work from a very good writer,"Some of Guterson's descriptions are marvelous. The loneliness of his main character trying to meet the goal of his death is a long and thought out process. Problem is the thoughts are slow and plodding. There wasn't much dialog and it seemed you wanted to rush through the book in order to find out the ending, or the meat. I became edgy reading this, and the fact is, I couldn't get through it."
1,East of the Mountains,"The premise of this novel seemed interesting and the author garnered a slew of accolades for Snow Falling on Cedars (though I haven't read that work). Based on the above I thought I'd give this a try. Unfortunately I found it a poor effort. The writing is uninspiring and the plot unimaginative. If Cedars was as good as the ratings indicate, Guterson either rushed this, or resurrected something he'd written before he developed his talent and had wisely stored away on a closet shelf, forgotten. With his Cedars' success, he pulled it out to foist on an unsuspecting public. Either that, or he and his publisher mimiced his East of the Mountains' character, Ben Givens, and were smoking dupe. I made it through 200 pages and skimmed the rest. Take my advice and skip the whole thing."
3,What's the point?,"I identified with David Guterson's East of the Mountains on several different levels. Namely, I live in Washington; I have a father who has had colon cancer; I hunt birds in eastern Washington, and I own two Brittanies, one of which is named Rex. I've also been to a lot of the places in the story, and I'm familiar with the landscape and terrain he describes. For these reasons alone the book was interesting to me, although I kept reading, waiting for Ben Givens to have some sort of epiphany, or for the story to have a point. Ben lives through a series of incidents which evoke chapter long memories of his past, and it appears that he finally just grows tired of the whole adventure as I did.The author obviously has an incredible talent for descriptive writing, but I found it overused at times, reading flowery descriptions of objects that could be described with ordinary prose, without taking away from the story."
4,Eat the whole apple,"I read this flying from the east coast to the west. At first I, too, was disappointed at the spare, slow action; I missed the lush western shore of ""Cedars"" but as I kept reading it came together. The journey into cancer, the journey into the seemingly bare landscape of eastern Washington, the journey into life itself is hard and slow. It is the mundane, plodding details that keep us too busy in this life to leave it. Guterson may have disappointed the fans of his first book by not doing another one like it, but it is that difference that makes this special. I am buying another copy to pass around."
4,sentimental journey,"Ben Givens is a man who has given up on life. Because of a devastating disease, he has lost control of the future, which he plans to regain by committing a well-planned suicide. Well, the 'best-laid plans' are quickly turned topsy-turvy, and Ben finds himself moving toward an immersion in, and appreciation of, the present. It is a sentimental journey, of wonderful and harsh reminiscences of youth, interspersed with the current physical trek, full of encounters and exploration. There is much description of the landscape. The book is well-written and engaging. In the right hands, it will make a beautiful film; but read the book first!"
5,Great!,"This is a story of a retired surgeon dying of cancer who sets out to kill himself, and through a series of incidents goes down some unplanned paths (I will not spoil the story for you). It is a thoughtful and compassionate look through the eyes of a dying man and an engaging story that I loved reading and which reminded me of books by Wallace Stegner. I recommend it highly."
4,Serious Stuff,"I love this author. Makes you think and even though this is a serious subject you can laugh about and relate to some of his situations. this is the second book that I have read by Guterson, and I am looking for some other titles."
2,I did not like it and was very disappointed.,"This is my first reply to your book review optionI was very disappointed in this book. I loved Snow...Cedars but this one was a WASTE OF MONEY! I expected much better work from this author- I found it boring and very drawn out, so drawn out that I skipped most of the middle and read the last few pages just to give myself closure. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!"
5,Must Read,"Whether or not you loved Snow Falling on Cedars, you will love this book. It is very well written, and despite what may seem to be a depressing premise, the book is uplifting, not depressing.This is one of the best books I have read in awhile."
4,Simple is nice.,"Everyone is right, the book is a hair contrived and at times drags on (especially the flashbacks). But, I really became attached to Ben. Like all road stories (Blue Highwways, On the Road etc.) this tale shares people and events that keep us rivited. Unlike others i have not read Snow Falling on Cedars but I think I will give it a try. This is a good rainy day Sunday book, nothing more nothing less. But I would defintely recommend it."
4,Enjoyable book,"I think reviews are most effective if you compare the book in question to others that most of us have read, so prospective readers have something to measure it against. East of the Mountains could be best described as a novel of courage and dedication--with the emotional power of The Triumph and the Glory or Stones from the River, the literary charisma of Grisham at his best, and a theme worthy of the tradition of Snow Falling on Cedars."
2,Don't waste your time.,"The narrative is good, the ending OK. But the dialogue is wooden, there are wrong usages of words (adverse-averse; ""may"" instead of ""might""), which were written in error and not edited out. The book looks as if it had been rushed out to capitalize on Snow Falling.I tell myself to stop reading as soon as I know a book's a dud; I wish I'd followed my own advice here. At least ""East of"" is short. If you want good writing, try: Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes, Mordecai Richler's Barney's Version, Martin Cruz Smith's Gorky Park, John Irving's Widow for One Year, and anything by Richard Russo. But don't waste your time on Guterson."
3,Great story ... no ending,"I enjoyed reading the story and thought that the idea of the trip and the characters he meets all along the way were all well done. From the very beginning ... all through the book, the exploration of the characters was well done.But ... the ending was so abrupt and sudden I felt like he had not reached that point yet. Found it to be very disappointing...."
2,"Doesn't come close to ""Snow Falling on Cedars""","Rarely do I not finish a book, but I admit to not finishing this one. My interest just ran out before I was halfway through. For me, the story was tainted by images of bowel habits and human decay. The story line could not overcome my distaste enough for me to get through to the end. I am not in the habit of reviewing books but this was such a disappointment. I loved ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" and actually purchased it twice after leaving the first copy on a plane. On the other hand, my husband really likes this book! I may have to try it again when he's finished."
2,A Short Story/Travel Commentary fluffed to Novel proportions,"Weak storyline, an ending that could not be justified in this short novel. Check this one out of the library."
2,"Good writing, bad story.","Guterson's use of a pack of wild Irish Wolfhound is just plain absurd. Irish Wolfhounds are the most docile of dog breeds. They are lazy, if anything. They are very independent-minded and I doubt if any ""pack mentality"" in the way Guterson suggests would occur.The author plainly used wolfhounds because of their size. Equally as plain: he never met one.Otherwise the book was good writing about implausible events."
3,Too wordy. Would edit to a good short story,"This does not compare with 'Snow Falling on Cedars"" The first two chapters are good , but after that the book becomes tedious and too repetitious of scenery, weather, etc. The conversations are stilted. It almost seems that the author ran out of things to say in the last chapters."
3,Disappointing.,After reading 'Snow Falling on Cedars' I was ready to rip into David Guterson's next book.I wasn't ready for the hopelessness of Dr. Givens and his intent to control even this last act of his life. I kept saying....why am I reading this?I got tired of all the rambling. There is some good that comes out of all of it....Dr. Givens finally gets the point and changes his course. But it took a long while to get there.Not the great that 'Snow....' was. Sorry.
1,What a disappointment!,"This book in no way compares with ""Snow Falling..."". The characters are so undeveloped they are obscure. We don't know them or understand their stories. On page 142 Ben asks, ""What in God's name was he (Ben) doing out here..."" It's precisely the question I'd been asking from the book's beginning. It's never answered and it should have been. My advice: save your time, read something interesting."
3,Climbing this Mountain,"I looked forward to this book the way I would a gourmet meal. After feasting on Guterson's ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" I set aside a weekend to savor every tantalizing flavor of his new literary meal. It smelled so good; alas, the taste couldn't match the promised delight. Guterson can write beautifully, evocatively, with keen perception into human relationships. He did this in his other ""feast"" while surrounding these basic nutrients of writing with the spices and herbs of strongly portrayed place and setting. Once again, he tries to season his wordy offering, but this time the herbs detract rather than enhance, the spices bite rather than tease. This journey from the mountains was barely worth the climb. But--golly gee--if Guterson sets the table one more time, I'm sure I'll sit down for a bite."
5,As death approaches,"This is an elegantly written novel about a physician facing death and contemplating suicide. The main character is Dr. Ben Givens, a thorasic surgeon who discovers that he has colon cancer. His journey ""East of the Moutains"" is a hunting trip he hopes to use as a cover for his planned suicide. He has recently lost his wife of 50 years and wants to spare his daughter another long illness. The book is populated with brief encounters with interesting, well drawn characters. I've never been to eastern Washington but the writing so fluid and descriptive I now feel I have been there. For some reason I was reminded of the best of Steinbeck's work. Mr. Guterson manages to make us think about mortality, and entertains us on the journey. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,Better than Snow Falling on Cedars,"I'm quite suprised by the reviews that rate this book a poor follow up to Snow Falling on Cedars. They are very different books, and East of the Mountains is intentionally more focused on an internal journey of an individual man. If you understand that going in, the book completely lives up to what we expect from Guterson's writing.It does lack the intricate weaving of multiple characters and storylines of Snow Falling on Cedars, but I really enjoyed the attention Guterson gives to Ben's character development. And no one has ever captured the essence of Eastern Washington like this author has--having lived there for 5 years (now in Seattle, much like the lead character), his visual portaits of the land are both accurate and stunning.If you appreciate understanding what motivates characters, and enjoy rich, descriptive detail of landscapes, you will like this book."
2,Stilted narration makes this a real snoozer,"I, who grew up in the very towns Guterson described, looked forward to reading this book with great anticipation. What a disappointment!The narrative was stiflingly slow. Guterson seemed intent on poetically describing, in minute detail, every windswept road, tumbleweed and piece of sagebrush from Vantage to Wenatchee. The book literally reeked with graphic descriptions of wounds to dogs, birds and humans. The purpose of these descriptions seemed intended solely to shock the reader.The ponderous descriptions drew the focus so far from the main character that he seemed like an afterthought. The main character's flashbacks to his youth -- which could have brought him to life -- fell flat, simply overshadowed by Guterson's obsession with creating a backdrop for this character.Hunters, veterans or doctors MAY manage to find some redeeming value in this book, but it's doubtful. Don't waste your time on this one, folks."
4,Human life and loss,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Snow Falling On Cedars with my book group, I looked forward to Guterson's second book. He handles human tragedy with grace and dignity in both books, though East of the Mountains was even more intense as the reader examines Ben's pending mortality prior to the autopsy table.East of the Mountians is about loss: Ben's loss of his own life, loss of the love of his life, loss of his youth, loss of hope and the world's loss of Ben, of Rachel, of their love for each other. Snow Falling on Cedars looked at past loss and moves on; East of the Mountains looks at future loss and lost of the past too. The omnipresent feeling of loss as life comes to its end was overpowering to me, so much so, I had to put the book down often to let the vicarious despair pass.I enjoyed the book, but closed it with a feeling of overwhelming sadness; knowledge that my own life will contain the same sorts of loss as Ben's and the same, sad evenual outcome."
2,a disappointment after the wonderful Snow Falling on ...,"Boring, depressing, full of vivid descriptions of the bowel problems of a man with terminal colon cancer."
2,Big Letdown,"His first book, Snow Falling on Cedars, was terrific and one of my all time favorites. This one falls flat and disappointing -- and would be so even without comparison to his first book. Save your money. A major weakness is the Army/combat stuff, which was also the major weakness of his first book. Like a lot of Boomers he has no experience of war, and the scenes ring hollow -- at least to one who has had that experience. Hope his third book will be back up to standard"
5,Loved it !,Although not as good as SFOC Gutersons 2nd novel is a worthy read. Can't wait for him to come up with another one.
3,"Be a little more flexible, Guterson fans!","Sure, this 2nd novel isn't as good as the first one, and true, it is about something depressing. But the middle and last part of the book is well worth sticking with the first part. Guterson's main character's description of his mother is as beautiful as a song, and his vignettes with various migrant workers seem authentic and enobling. If you liked the novel ""Cold Mountain,"" you'll like the descriptions of the natural world found in Gutterson's new one. Both books are incredible treats for gardeners more than anyone else, maybe outdoorsy types too, like me, who are more interested in the acual running of a real apple farm than the running of, say, Wall Street or the White House."
3,Disappointing...,"There have been a number of Snow Falling on Cedar fans who found East of the Mountains not exactly what they had in mind. I'm certainly not going to say that David Guterson has no talent and that East of the Mountains is not literary. As someone very familiar with nature, I admire his observations and his manner of expression. Nonetheless, this is a book read once that will not be read a second time. Somehow, it just fell flat.I've met David Guterson and understand his point of view comes, admittedly, from Russian ancestors. Perhaps I'm just too non-Russian to understand why anyone would have wanted to write this book."
3,Nice story but could be better,"This novel had so much potential, but fell short. The plot showed promise, the style of writing flowing, but the story soon disappointed me. The characters were shallow and needed to be developed,, with more engaging scenes. I never felt the actual transition of Ben like one expects in really great books."
2,Had to put this down...,"Determined to try this as a big fan of Snow Falling, I didn't make it past the early chapters. I was mildly shattered when I first learned about the cancer themes - a subject too personal for this reader. However I live in Washington state and wanted to try it and love it. Just could not get past the gruesome, dying man themes to enjoy Guterson's lovely nature writing. Bought the book at Amazon and have since donated it to my library. I hope there were good motivations for the cancer themes as they are excruciating to read about for those who have had the disease."
2,Disappointing; rushed; loose prose,"I was so looking forward to reading this second novel by the author of the delicately crafted Snow Falling on Cedars.But this novel proved a disappointment. I can't help but feel that he has been such a sensation that his publisher pressured him to crank one out quickly - and it failed.The dialogue seems stiff and forced; the characters encountered by the elderly doctor seem artificial and one-dimensional. His decision to smoke pot comes too quickly and with no explanation, on the heels of an adamant refusal to smoke that stuff. His memories of childhood, the war and meeting his wife seemed an author's trick of filling uncomfortable gaps in the action.I ended up merely skimming too many pages. This is a shame. I believe David Guterson is a magical writer. And this story could have been so good. I hope he takes more time on his next one."
2,"Good writing, theme, characterization, but excessive descrip","The writing is smooth, relaxing Guterson, but the story falls far short of ""Snow Falling.."" Way too much description of the country and landscape around Wenatchee. In a story of peregrinations, the author can confuse the reader by so many places where things take place. The theme, a man intending suicide, has his mind changed by events, a good one, and effective here. But I thought the book tended to be too padded with travelogue, names of rivers, highways, etc."
2,Nice try but no cigar.,"After reading the great new novel, The Triumph and the Glory, I was looking forward to another memorable experience with East of the Mountains because I'd loved Snow Falling on Cedars so much. But this new one from Guterson just fell flat for me. I just couldn't accept the main character's motivations as believeable, and that will pretty much destroy a novel."
1,This book was so poorly written that I could not finish it.,"I had high hopes for this book when I began reading it, however, these hopes were dashed right away. Mr. Guterson could not create a believable main character and when this man began to have ""experiences"" with other characters this story became so predictable that I gave up in disgust. It was obvious that each character was meant to impart some bit of wisdom and then vanish forever. How trite and hackneyed. To go from ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" to this is a disgrace. The only explanation I can imagine is that Mr. Guterson wrote this book just to fulfill his contract with the publisher. I won't be so quick to pick up the next book he writes."
3,Disappointing,"After all the hype from the reviewers, I was set to stay up all night reading, as I did with Guterson's debut novel (""Snow Falling on Cedars""). Boy, was I disappointed. The book is not bad...but it is not good either. The rich character development I was expecting from ""Snow"" was all but gone, and I found it hard to care about the protagonist. This book was a definite disappointment."
3,storyline takes intellectual easy path - misses opportunity,"First, Guterson is a man of substantial writing abilities. In fact, I agree with many who have noticed Cormac McCarthy in this piece, and I believe he has the talent to pull it off. I thought the novel started out with a great premise, the foundation that could have made a truly great novel was laid with grace and considerable skill. However, the novel seemed to get off-track in the middle, and by the time I finished the piece I wondered who actually developed the plot line; Guterson or his publisher, wishing to produce a piece of neutral pablum that would create that largest possible economic market for this book. Too bad, this could have been a Great American Novel. The good news is I think Guterson still has one in him."
2,Guterson attempts Cormac McCarthy,"If you like the beautiful work of Cormac McCarthy's trilogy(All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, Cities of the Plain), do not read Guterson's new book. Here, you'll find a writer obviously attempting to write in the style of McCarthy, and failing. I seriously struggled to get through the first 64 pages of this book, but ploughed onward, with the knowledge that the book will be featured everywhere, from Barnes & Noble displays to dozens of reviews in magazines and journals. The book loses its ponderous McCarthyisms in the second half, which is better. My favorite parts include the relationship betweeen Givens and his dogs, and the sexual attractions he has with the younger female characters. I never read Guterson's Snow Falling on Cedars, so I can not compare it to that. I would advise readers to skip this one, and pick up McCarthy's Cities of the Plain for first-rate writing."
2,the first paragraph sets the tone,"In the first paragraph we learn the character's sleep is visited - not interrupted, mind you, but visited - by phantoms: images of everything from family members to fruit trees. In the same breath we are told he didn't dream - that these images guarded the portal to dreams. Hmm. Sounds nice and literary, but if your sleep is visited by phantoms and images isn't that dreaming? Then we learn that he is insomniac and didn't sleep at all. Okay... But the pain he feels ""throughout all his waking hours"" only hits him when his feet hit the floor. Huh? Three self-contradictions on the first page. If good writing is long, rhythmic streams of words, and that seems to be the definition of the other reviewers here, then DG is a genius. By any other definition this is verbiose, pretentious drivel."
2,A disjointed tale containing two fine set pieces,"East of the Mountains was a very disappointing follow up to Snow Falling on Cedars. Snow was a suspenseful murder story, combining a compelling criminal trial, a disturbing return to the internment of Japanes during WWII, a fine description of landscapes and a touching love story.East of the Mountains is a disjointed tale with little of interest. A man ill with an incurable cancer has a car accident and then is sucked into a succession of improbable events that is broken up only by two longish and compelling set pieces.The first is a reminiscence of youth in this region of orchards as the protagonist met and fell in love with his eventual wife.The second is a brutal depiction of a battle during the Italian Campaign in WWII.At the end of the book, the protagonist returns where he started, symbolizing neatly a book that achieves very little, as even the central story of how to deal with death gets nowhere.All in all disappointing."
1,Guterson has lost his way.,"When compared to Snow Falling on Cedars, Guterson's East of the Mountains, has disappointed this reader. It's as if he had to publish another book quickly to recapture his audience. I fault his publisher. He would have better spent more time and write about a more interesting subject. He even could have used this theme if he had found some way to develop his characters in more depth. They are all very shallow and superficial. Hopping from character to character did nothing for me. Guterson should reread his ""Snow Falling..."" to find a book worth writing. I know he has the talent. Please try again, Mr. Guterson."
1,A waste of time and money,"Reading this book is mental torture. The plot, if there is one, moves at a snail's pace. The characters are wooden and forgettable. A major disapointment."
1,A disappointment,Way too much hunting. Some lovely descriptions but writing generally wooden. Unconvincing ending. Last but not least -- painful to read for anyone who loves dogs.
4,A novel of self-discovery,"A sometimes disturbing story of a man's attempt at suicide--a suicide that will appear accidental AND hide the fact that he will die before cancer kills him.On the way to his suicide mission, Ben Givens is involved in an accident that forces him to make a soul-searching journey. The foot-journey ""east of the mountains"" allows him to reflect on his past--his family history, his one true love Rachel, his medical career.And the turning point comes with a birth. Called upon to assist with a difficult delivery, he witnesses the struggle for life. His efforts save both the mother and infant. ""Things looked different now.""A great story of self-discovery. And the reminder that self-discovery is a life-long quest."
2,"Beautiful words, contrived plot","Yes, I loved Snow Falling on Cedars and was anxiously awaiting his new novel. Although Guterson very ably shows his love of the land, I thought he fell disappointingly short in his depiction of Ben Givens and the adventures he encounters along his trek to end his life. Some were OK, others were downright hokey. The flashback scenes were the best part of the book. Still, it wasn't enough to save this story whose denouement, I'm sorry to say, seemed so contrived and unconvincing."
3,"Pleasing, easy read but lies in the shadow of those Cedars.","After Snow Falling I had to get hold of this book. It is good, he is a very good writer - maybe a 'great' in the making but I felt that the 'mood' was a little forced and his journey predictable. Any book is an investment of both heartbeats and hard currency and I certainly did not regret either."
2,"Definitely NOT ""Snow Falling on Cedars""","Guterson is a WONDERFUL writer. His use of words is absolutely beautiful. So ... after ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" which I adored, I really looked forward to this one. Alas and alack, I was disappointed. I was, let us say, a captive audience in the car while the tapes played, and after a short while I was beginning to get antsy for the book to have a storyline. The detailed descriptions of the gore (my friend said he'd never heard the word ""viscera"" used so much before) made me queasy. And it's so depressing! Eventually, I was sorely tempted to grab the steering wheel and ram the car into a tree to stop the horror, and by the end I was ready to rip my ears off to escape. My boss loved it -- recommends it to everyone he sees. I didn't love it -- and I'm not alone. Like I said, the writing is beautiful -- almost poetic. The plot leaves a whole lot to be desired. So give it a try. Just please be warned that it's definitely not like ""Snow Falling on Cedars."""
1,Maybe he has only one novel in him,"I was disappointed in this second novel. After having read 'Snow Falling on Cedars' (recommended) I was looking forward to this book. 'East of the Mountains' lacks the ring of truth and as I made my way through this irritatingly soppy story; I suspected Guterson of writing, rather than a novel, a potential screenplay."
2,A disappointment at best.,"I'm disappointed. It took me months to buy this book, because I thought Snow Falling on Cedars was a little too soft for me, but then I saw this over and over on the bestseller list, and decided it must be good. Wrong! What IS the author's point? I couldn't feel sorry for Ben, I think I would have respected and liked him more if he had gone on with his plan. Ben is not even developed to the point where one could identify with him, instead he is written about as though he was never really supposed to exist anyway. The beginning of the story holds a little, but begins to fade in the middle, when Ben's exploits and adventures (if you can call them that) are being described, and the ending is really stupid. I'm horrified that the hardcover edition of this book costs $17.50! It isn't worth $2.00 at a bargain basement. Still, I gave it two stars instead of zero because it filled a few hours of my time, and anyone interested in a mindless trek into nothing might just enjoy it."
4,A book of strength and character,"This is an outstanding book that moved me from beginning to end. The character of Dr. Ben Givens is one that I will remember for a long time - - a man who devoted his life to saving others, yet in despair couldn't bear to live out the rest of his own due to a terminal illness. In East of the Mountains, his journey both into the wilderness and his past were basically one in the same, allowing him to face his impending death with strength, courage, and ultimately on his own terms.I must admit that I have not had the pleasure of reading Guterson's first book Snow Falling on Cedars (but I plan to right away). However, I think it is unfair for many of the readers to compare this book with his previous work, or any other. In my opinion, this book more than stands on its own merits. It is an introspective, insightful look at relationships and life."
2,Givens Up,"David Guterson can write well; that much is evident in ""Snow Falling on Cedars."" But this book fails as a follow-up to that novel. In fact, about one hundred pages to the end, I've just given up. I find little to recommend in this novel. Most of the characters are cliched, two-dimensional creations, and the plot (what little there is of it) just plods along; about all that can be praised in the novel is Guterson's way with a descriptive phrase. I found Ben's wartime experiences jolting interruptions to the flow of the novel. The whole thing sort of seems just thrown together. I happened to read the last page, and am glad I didn't waste my time with the preceding hundred or so pages. Maybe Guterson will fare better with his third novel. Let's hope so."
4,My First Guterson Read,"I did not read Snow Falling on Cedars, and I am glad I did not because it seems to prejudice ""Snow"" readers against the style, structure and content employed for East of the Mountains. The book's premise, a retired surgeon faces terminal cancer, drew me in. The writing kept me there. The writer makes it look easy as he lays down a beautiful, thought-provoking story."
3,Plot to rival Disney,"I approached this book with anticipation having enjoyed Snow Falling on Cedars so much. However, despite the fact that Guterson is obviously a great writer, he disappoints in this book because of the artificial plot. In a few days our hero accomplishes an awful lot, especially for a 73-year-old. Some of it is believable but towards the end, as he helps to save a Mexican boy from dying of Tb and finally ushers in a new life threatening not to arrive in this world, I am pushed to the limits of my suspension of belief. Next time a simpler, more believable plot."
1,Bored to tears,"""Snow Falling on Cedars"" is one of my favorite books of the past five years. The author's talent is truly amazing. I was anxiously awaiting this book, and told my mom that is was the only thing I wanted for my birthday. What a disappointment. It is without doubt one of the most boring books I've read (or tried to read - I quit half way through) in a long time. Do yourself a favor -- skip this and just read ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" again."
4,Beautiful.,East of the Mountains held me. I found myself staying up through the night to read - a pleasure that few books can bring me to. Absolutely beautiful.
1,A tour de waste of time.,"A second book that is second rate, so disappointing after his great debut.It would have been so much better if Ben had taken the opportunity to have had a fatal car crash in the first 50 pages and saved me the time of reading the other 200."
2,SORRY...NOT THAT INTERESTING,"I started the book with anticipation and enjoyed the first few chapters. However, the story started going downhill when Ben meets character after character with not much happening. Ben doesn't seem to come to any conclusions through the course of his physcial journey and and I didn't see any emtional journey taking place either. Also, the writer mentions geographic areas endlessly and unless you're familiar with the area of eatern Washington, it was bit boring to hear of all the landmarks and town names. Not a very stimulating read."
2,The Literary Talent is Obvious But No Story Here,"The author of this book has wonderful literary talent. But unfortunately I found the work to be,if not downright pretentious, highly presumptuous. There was no story. The events were episodic, predictable and boring; points to be made by the author masquerading as plot. One cliche after another. Snow Falling on Cedars was much better but even those characters never really breathed life either. All the characters this author creates seem to have life happen in their close vicinity rather than that they lived."
4,enjoyable,"i read this book before reading 'Snow..'-to be honest I listened to most of it on PublicRadio's 'Radio Reader' then I got the book. I thought it created a very strong visual of the Northwest. Having never been there I felt as if I could picture sagebrush, chukars in flight, huge farm fields and mountains. I'll never claim to be an expert critic on books, but unlike some other reviews here, I look for a book I think I'll enjoy and find interesting. At times i felt sorrow for Ben and other times I envied him. Enjoyed the characters of the young couple who picked him up. GOOD book!"
3,Provocative book,"This book was an interesting read. It covers many controversial issues but it merely mentions them and then moves on without any real discussion. However, the book was very well written. The descriptions were beautifully done and made you feel the woods around you and smell the smells he described. I'm glad I read it but I would say that it is not as good as Snow Falling on Cedars."
3,"Beautiful descriptions, but predictable and slow","I so enjoyed reading ""Our Lady of the Forest"" and ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" that I was sure I would like this book, too. The story is that of a recently widowed heart surgeon who is diagnosed with colon cancer. He doesn't want to put his kids or himself through ""death by cancer"", so he heads out on a hunting trip with his two dogs and intends to ""have an accident"" to end it all on his terms. From page one I predicted what was going to happen, and I was right (won't tell you because I don't want to spoil it if the reader of this review hasn't figured it out). Since I spent many years in the western and middle sections of Washington state where this story is set, I enjoyed the author's beautiful descriptions of the scenery and the way of life there. But the story drags, and I skipped lots of pages in order to make it move along. Definitely not my favorite Guterson novel."
4,Fine novel set in Eastern Washington state. Ordered 2nd copy.,My brother is unable to order from Amazon.com so I do so for him. He asked me to get him another copy since he wanted to read it again and had lost his. Is there a better recommendation than that?
5,Captivating gracefulness,"When my older brother recommended this book and briefly described the plot, I was not particularly enthralled. In a day of sensational exposes and relentless action novels, a man going forth to die does not sound particularly mind-grabbing. However, I was underestimating Guterson. Here is a writer who can truly write. The best thing about it is that he does not seem to be straining to write well, as some authors do. One is not aware of the author, only of the narrative moving inexorably forward with language that can only be described as graceful and seamlessly descriptive.This novel will make you think about things that matter. It may even motivate you to reassess your life and make a few adjustments. If you are so stuck in the mundane boredom of your life that you refuse to reflect, then you perhaps can pass this book by. Otherwise, pick up a copy and read it."
2,BORING,"All I can say is insufferable details that go on and on, are boring or make you sick, I believe I skipped over more than I read. A vast array of small insignificant details leaked together make up most of this story. I believe this would have been a much better story without a lot of the detail."
3,"Mixed feelings--interesting premise, bland characters","I wanted to like this book much more than I ultimately did. The story had an interesting, engaging premise, but didn't really deliver. We're given only glimpses of other characters and they lack any real depth. The main character is not well-developed. His profession as a surgeon--spurred apparently by one war-time incident--seems like a tired cliched plot device in what otherwise could be a much more complex novel. And even though we're told he's a surgeon he just could easily have been a civil engineer for all the difference it really makes in the novel. It also stretched credibility that someone with this advanced form of colon cancer was able to keep his condition hidden from loved ones and perform some pretty arduous hiking."
3,A pleasent read,"East of the mountains is the follow-up novel to Snow on the Cedars. In this book the author attempted to duplicate the charm and concept of his first book but did not fully succeed. The use of flash backs can get a bit irritating, but do add a certian charm to the book. The story line is a bit dragged out and tends to loose the readers interest at times. I give the author merit for his ability to tempt the reader with romance and war without having to fully discuss the event. This is a book that I would recommend to a younger audience as well as a matured reader. No profanity, no vulgarity. Deals with a topic we will all have to face eventually...death."
2,"Eloquent language and description, yet a contrived plot","I eagerly awaited this book and was ultimately disappointed. The descriptions of eastern Washington are absolutely spectacular. The way the story and descriptions of the landscape mesh reminded me of Wallace Stegner. Ultimately, though the plot seemed contrived and not particularly compelling. I hope the author comes up with a better plot for his next effort."
3,Will three be the charm?,"David's first novel was so compelling, it seemed unlikely he could attain the heights a second time. And yes ... it proved unlikely. However, because of the strength of ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" I would be willing to read his third attempt. ""East of the Mountains"" failed not for lack of a plot ... but in execution. The dialogue was hurried and thin. A pokey pace. And the presentation never approached the same standard as his first work. Did you change editors? Give it another try, David. I'll read it."
3,Read this book,"Get over it, people. Mark McGwire doesn't hit it out of the park every at bat. This is a good book and if you like Guterson, you're a fan already. It's not a page-turner-can't-put-it-down, but it's a good read and you could do lots worse."
1,A grave dissapointment.,"East of the mountains has retained the sophmore curse - the second of anything is never as good as the first. This book leads off with an interesting premise, but doesn't go anywhere with it. The author just moves the main character around, leaving him with nothing to do. He wants to commit suicide, he's in a car accident, his dogs are attacked, he meets a few new people on his way to the vet, and he helps with the delivery of a baby. There is the whole story in a nutshell. I hope his next book is a vast improvement over this one, and I also hope that he can learn from his mistakes."
2,prime example of the tyranny of creative writing classes,"Amazing how much wordiness we've learned to put up with - no, we even demand it, as proof of good writing. We therefore learn in Chapter One of Guterson's new book that a character steadies a ""cup of lemon tea"" (lemon, note - lest you think it might have milk in it)""on the dashboard so that it shed a crescent of steam against the windshield."" Very nice, good observation - but so what? The writer includes it for the usual creative writing class reason: because he can."
5,"a powerful, haunting novel","After ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" I wondered if this fabulous writer would prove true in a second novel -- this book is even better! It's so crisply written, so eloquent, so compelling. I have already started reading it a second time -- I usually don't do that until after a year or so from the first read, but I couldn't wait on this one. We are so lucky to have a wonderful writer like Mr. Guterson -- I can't wait for his next novel... and the one after that, too!!!!"
4,A tribute to Papa,"Guterson is a marvelous writer. His first book contained elements of To Kill A Mockingbird and Moby Dick, an understandable point when you think of his experience as a high school English teacher. This, I think, contains Hemingway and Stegner: man faces nature, love, family, society, war, responsibility and himself in the most profound ways possible. I've been lonely since Stegner left us; here's a chance to pretend that he and Papa have returned. Don't miss it."
3,I could smell the apples.,I enjoyed this book very much. The detailed description of the area was great and the reflections on real war situations gave me insight into what it is really like. I like this guys writing.
2,The Bible according to the opinion of Sister Mary Theola,"I did not read all of this book because Sister Mary gives her opinion on Angels, how Adam and Eve were created, and whether Adam and Eve really lived in the garden of Eden. There are words used that even I had to look up the meaning in the dictionary.All in all, I think I'll stick to a Childrens Bible that the Church recommends, and will not read this book to my grandchildren."
1,"If you love truth, don't buy this book for your children.",This book runs contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church. Not a good book for impressionable young minds. Unless of course you want them to lose their faith?
4,Good pruduct,I have purchased this product more than once it works well for holding my perintoneal dialysis cath in place without being obvious under clothing.
5,Christian Teaching Classic,"I first saw this book two or three years ago in a used book store, and purchased it because I wanted something that would explore Jesus teaching methods. Sadly, it sat on my bookshelf until recently when I finally got around to reading it. However, when I finally read the book, I found it to be one of the best books I have ever read on the subject of teaching. While it was written for Sunday school teachers, the information is applicable to all ages. It is clear, concise, and the principles are timeless. I felt it was so good that I wanted to share it with four others in our church who teach/lead women's Bible studies. When I mentioned it to my Pastor, he indicated he would like to read it also. I found five more copies online. All the copies are used, but this is not an issue. Used or new, this is an excellent and well written book for those who teach any age level in churches.Donna L. Morse"
4,A good over all presentation.,"So, I just got this dvd and I thought it was pretty decent but nothing that hasn't been covered before. This was somewhat generic as far as the information goes and there wasn't real great combat footage. There were many scenes of actual footage but not much engagement. I think they left out the graphic stuff because this was originally on tv. Also, like every other Vietnam documentary, it excludes most of the war crimes committed, especially anything mentioning agent orange. But aside from all this, the documentary was well done, it definitely wasn't boring and the footage was very crisp and clear, obviously remastered because this is a newer documentary. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a solid and well rounded documentary of the Vietnam War."
3,Good Program,"There have been a lot of programs and material in written form about our War in Vietnam. For someone looking to learn more about it, this is a good balanced program. Much of what is here is not new to me and many details are glossed over. So for me it is an ok one."
2,Interesting but...,"Not terribly useful if one is looking for anything in detail about this long conflict. A n umber of scenes used over and over and over as if there was a paucity of decent film clips. No mention that Walter Cronkite got the significance of Tet '68 totally wrong. It skips lightly over Kennedy's motivations for sending troops in the early 60's, McNamara's duplicity over the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and Johnson's incompetence as commander-in-chief / target analyst for the USAF. At the end of it, I was disappointed. Recommend a good book instead."
4,National Geographic: Inside the Vietnam War,"Inside the Vietnam War is one of the best stories about Vietnam I have seen. It shows for those who served there what took place before, after and while you were in-country. It's very informative and may help to bring some understanding about the war."
1,caveat lector,"For a knowledgeable review of this book's content, see Stephen Meyers' detailed examination of the carelessly sensational content, faulty documentation, and plainly inaccurate assertions. Meyers cares about the truth and is patient in his refutation -- not the kind of reviewer who can be casually demonized or dismissed. His concerns are applicable to other books by this author as well. [...]"
2,"""Scientific"" evidence","Overall I was disappointed with this book. I find some of the ideas interesting but I found mistakes concerning scienctific theories and major flaws in the research. For example when the author is discussing the birth of Christ he mentions that all the genetic information needed for the blood of the baby comes from the father. This is incorrect. These types of errors probably stem from the fact that many scientific articles listed in the bibliography are substancially out of date. I basically feel that most of the ""scientific"" evidence mentioned in this book is circumstancial and needs further investigation."
5,Best Mono book yet,"I prefer this book to the Mono : Developers Notebook which was also recently published. This book provides a much wider angle view on the .NET cross platform development space. For example, the developers note book covers TK#, this book covers TK# and #WT.This book is much more architectural in design than the Developers Notebook. So if code is your thing then you may want to evaluate both. I personally prefer architectural perspective because in this case it's more about choosing a direction of development as opposed to learning the structure of the TK# library, which is interesting, but can be gleaned from the online documentation.This is a must have book for anyone who wants to take their .NET code beyond the confines of the Windows operating system. It's well worth the price of admission."
1,overproduced garbage.,"First album - WonderfulLive at Stubbs - Excellent! One of my favorite albums of '05.This album. . . junk! Super overproduced, terribly boring songs and I'll be damned if I was waiting for a guest appearance by Jessica Simpson to come along somewhere. Seriously, this was probably the biggest disappointment I've had in some time seeing as I despise most new music. I was hoping Matisyahu could come along and change that opinion for me. . .instead, he just added himself to the top of an already overflowing pile of rubbish."
3,what,"to start, i haven't heard this album but i will relate what i've heard from my friends. this album is good, but not as good as his live at stubbs. whether its because of the quality of hte songs or because of hte energy associated with live songs i cannot say.as to Matt ""On3H34rT"" , what are you talking about. are you saying that musicians change style of music based upon fans level of interest? im assuming that matisyahu and co. just wanted to explore more stuff and not play the same stuff. i dont' believe it has anything to do with the fans interest because i don't believe matisyahu is just trying to write what we want to hear."
2,A Disappointment,"i was expecting some experimentation and something UNexpected, really and got none of that. almost all the songs have the same basic beat with different overlying beats and that can get annoying after a while. his song 'King Without A Crown' is by far his best, and all the rest just don't have that spunk and originality. i also have his 'Live at the Stubbs', and if u like Matisyahu, get that album and leave this one alone. its so much like the last album, just the bad version. his songs 'King without a Crown' is also better live on the LATS album. save this money and just add him to your myspace. he's so friggin cool, he just needs to get a little more experimental with his music."
5,Fantastic!!,"Matisyahu is a fresh new artist with a truely original sound. This CD seriously rocks, I have gotten many of my friends hooked on him. This album has a fast upbeat tempo that has a positive message. It is a mix of Reggae, beat-box, and some rap sounding lyrics mixed in. So different, so creative, and so refreshing.The album resonated with me. I am of a different faith, but love his devotions to his G-d. The lyrics are fast at times, and sometimes difficult to understand, nonetheless clever in every regard. Drop a few bones for this one..."
4,inspirational,"While I think I enjoyed live at stubbs more(which in my opinion is one of the best raggae albums ever), this album did not dissappoint. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is due to the over produced sound on some tracks. Overall a very good album, and the lyrics are very inspirational. Thank you Matisyahu for keeping raggae dub alive."
2,I expected more,judging for matisyahus first album i expected this album to be similar. I wanted an album that you could listen to from start to finish without pushing the button for the next song. Youth brings a different side to matisyahu with much more vocals and less cantering and slightly less reggae feel. Ill admit that i am somewhat dissapointed.
3,"Entertaining CD, but might not stand the test of time","I bought this disc based on the title track, which I believe is one of the catchiest and most inspirational songs in quite awhile. And other songs contain great hooks as well; songs like ""Jeruselum,"" ""What I'm Fighting For,"" and the hit ""King Without a Crown"" are instantly memorable.Unfortunately, somebody went crazy with the Pro-tools in recording this CD. There are times when Matisyahu's vocals sound more like a keyboard than a human voice. Becaused he got famous with the in-concert ""Live at Stubb's"" and he's a popular act on the jam band circuit, why not just let people enjoy his natural sound?This is a fun and engaging disc, but its heavy-handed production is destined to make it a period piece."
2,Reggae star lost the reggae,"What a monumental blunder. Unlike their promising debut, Shake off the Dust Arise, you'd be hard pushed to find any reggae at all here. I cannot describe the disappointment his fanbase feels."
5,"Excellent Album, talent and message!!!",I am personally glad that he went alittle more main stream or I would of never discovered this album. It's a work of art and very uplifting. We need more artists out there like him. I'm a new fan in a big way. I think there should be more indie sounding tracks. Recommended.
3,Sony is trying to ruin another amazing artist,"I hated it when I first heard it. Now after a few weeks I'm liking it more. Matisyahu was so amazing on his first CD's. Shake off the Dust...Arise was, despite an obvious low budget, amazing. Live at Stubb's kicked it up with a little more energy and although just a little different sounding, was still another amazing CD. I had assumed especially after seeing what Sony had done to other Artists (look at the difference on Incubus' albums from S.C.I.E.N.C.E. to Make yourself and you'll see what I mean) that this CD would be geared more towards a broader audience and WAY overproduced. Dispite the overproduction on this album I still think it's pretty descent. Not as original as before. A lot of it reminds me of like 90's music. Still I think it's pretty good CD."
2,not what I hoped for,"I loved...LOVED shake off the dust and live @ stubbs. I saw matis twice live and he was more incredible than words can explain. Of course I respect his right as an artist to grow, evolve, and expand. But for me, this album seemed to get away from what made Matty matter to me. i'll keep listening but, have been playing the old album since. It seems he went for a poppier sound, trying to cross over genres and reach more people. his original sound put him in the spolight and now he's gonna switch it up... fine. it's just not there for me."
5,Youth is Exuberant,"I must say that I was intrigued by the concept of a reggae band fronted by a Hasidic Jew, but what really drew me in is the quality of his beats, the fluid movement of the rhymes and the spiritual messages in the songs, I'm picky about music and I can't seem to find a song on this album I don't at least enjoy. My wife and I even chose to play ""Unique is my Dove"" as our first dance at the wedding. Keep an eye on this band, they'll be going places."
5,"Beautiful, Inspiring and Different","This CD is wonderful. The lyrics are uplifing, the sound is original and it comes togerther tocreate TRUE ART!"
3,"Refreshing and enjoyable, but a sidestep from previous efforts","Live at Stubbs was one of my favorite albums of last year, it was addicting, well crafted reggae. In the wake of that album I saw Matis at a show here in Chicago and he was absolutely fantastic, so my expectations for Youth were quite high.What I hear when listening to Youth is overproduction, a fate of many indie albums now. Part of the draw of live at stubbs and shake off the dust was that they weren't glimmering, shiny pop music, but instead had thier subtleties and nuances. I appreciate production values, bt not when they come at the cost of soul.Simply put this album is enjoyable (especially if you haven't heard the earlier stuff) but feels too robotic and poppy to have the same soulful resonance of his earlier work."
5,great!,"'King Without a Crown' from Live At Stubb's is most definitely my faviorite song of Matisyau! But now I have a second faviorote- Youth! The title songtrack is so amazing it's worth the album for it! The first song, Fire of Heavan/ Alter of Earth starts the album off with a Matisyahu bang, I love it! For those who are not ""sooo reggae"" comes ""What I'm Fighting For"" a guitar-based song, and to sum it up, there's a few I skip pretty often, but there's too many songs that are good to not get it!!!!"
4,Not just flavour-of-the-month!,"While many other reviewers are calling this flavour of the month (largely because I think of Matisyahu's incredible amount of TV and radio airtime), there is quite a bit of complexity in every song he creates, including everything from this latest release.Although this CD serves as a huge jump in the genre, mixing some rock (a transfer from the Live at Stubb's album) and even a little bit of other styles, it's still Matisyahu. His lyrics are powerful and piercing. These songs are about something that he cares deeply for -- and it shows.His title song is different, I agree. But is it any less appealing than King Without a Crown? I don't think so. It's just not what everyone was expecting.Despite a few imperfections, this is a solid ablum with a mix of genres that should appeal to everyone who is a fan of the original. It's different, but I think it's a fresh sort of difference that only adds to his music."
2,beware the bandwagon,"Admittedly, when everyone starts salivating over a particular musical act, I listen with a skeptical ear. So, I checked out his first two CDs and they are markedly better than this one.When my brother was about 8-years-old, he would lock himself in his room with his karaoke machine, Casio keyboard, and Jaminator and record his sessions for posterity. I found one of these tapes a few years ago and had a good laugh at his now 25-year-old expense. Now I'm wondering if I shouldn't send it in to a record company.This CD isn't the worst thing I've ever heard, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to listen to it ever again."
2,Pretty weak shtick,"If Matisyahu were a black guy, this would be a mediocre pop reggae album circa 1988, and you probably wouldn't even consider buying it. But he is a hasid and capitalizes on this shtick, and somehow we are supposed to think this makes the music sound better. Sure the word ""zion"" is peppered throughout his lyrics, and there's some psuedo spiritual angle here that offers some redemption, but overall it's pretty weak. His fake jamaican accent, overly produced electronic sound remind me of some bad reggae from way back!"
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I saw great promise in this album because I enjoyed some of his ""older"" stuff. Although some of that older stuff was often rather bland, the foundation was there for something great in the future. Unfortunately, this album didn't impress me in the least. The music is more progressive, but I find myself annoyed more than entertained. The most annoying thing about Matisyahu is his penchant for singing ""Oy yoy yoy oy"" in nearly every song. Even when he's not singing that phrase, he seems to makes every word some derivative of those nonsensical words. It just should have been so much better than this. ""Time of Your Song,"" ""Indestructible"" (very dancehall feel to it), and ""King Without a Crown"" (although the version on this album feels rushed) are some tracks I found more interesting than annoying after the first few listens."
3,The Legend of Reggae?,"Matisyahu is the greatest thing to come out of Jamaica in a while. You can tell by his lyrics, accent, and attitude that he is a true Rastafarian. Move over Bob Marley, theres a new player in town.It remains questionable to see if mainstream media will be willing to latch on the another reggae superstar. My guess is prospects are good."
4,Modest Yahoo,"Matisyahu never claimed to be Bob Marley or Shlomo Carlebach, so he shouldn't held to those standards. His music is damn good, better than most of the crap out there. As for ""selling out"" or going commercial, so what? Rage Against the Machine felt no cumpunction on being on a major label, they said that was the way to get their music to the most amount of people. This is way for Matis to spread his message beyond JCCs."
5,Best Matisyahu album.,This album is just amazing. I owned it before but had not heard it in awhile. I just ordered it again and I've fallen in love with it a second time. The lyrics are just fantastic.I regret not purchasing it again sooner.Really great songs!
4,"Honoring G-d, one stutter-beat at a time","These men, who look like three yeshiva drop-outs and one graduate, have turned out another delightful CD, overflowing with good cheer and genuinely groovy beats. The song ""Youth"" is a bit silly, but standouts tend to be in major keys anyway, and feature Matisyahu rapping/scatting/SOMEthing a bajillion miles a minute in a high, not-very-in-tune tenor: the over-the-top ""Send In The Troops"", the multi-levelled ""Indestructible"", the really pretty ""Time Of Your Song"" and one you'll barrel down the highway actually singing: ""Jerusalem"". The production is not as raw as some would like. Instead, it's addictive. And Ill Factor produced my favorites. Yowza!Reggae's unstoppable: always morphing, and, as with any medium worth the effort, serving back all artists who truly serve it. So: Crown Heights, Brixton, Kingston or Haifa--who cares? If it keeps up as cool as a good chunk of this CD, Matisyahu might just take over the world."
3,Matisyahu - 'Youth' (Sony),"Review no.89. Okay,I had someone pull a gag on me,telling me that I just HAD to give this CD a listen. After I saw the cover,I thought,""What the...?"" Always wanting to be fair to new/er artists of every genre,I must admit that Matisyahu (aka Mathew Paul Miller) performs his music well. Even though, this work of the Hasidic Jewish musician fusing reggae with rap isn't my bag, I've still heard his name mentioned before. In fact, I believe he played at a 1,000 seat concert venue in my town fairly recent and the newspaper write-up mentioned, ""You know in another year that Matisyahu is going to be BIG"". Let's wait and see."
4,Surprising to say the least!,"This artist and album surprised the crap out of me in many ways. For one I'm no big fan of reggae, but every single lyric from Matisyahu just pulled me in for more. And to see a Jewish artist getting airplay, i can't help but smile! Each song is powerful in it's own way, whether about Jerusalem and the holocaust, or old highschool memories. Matisyahu is a force to be reckoned with, and is not compromisng to anything."
2,Disappointing,I love Matisyahu. Live at Stubb's is awesome.This CD is overproduced and has only one good track.
1,Dont waste your money,"I would retitle this book How to Dominate Your Horse With Fear and Punishment. Some of the suggestions are likely to get an inexperienced person hurt and will certainly cause problems for horses. Even some of the photos are painful to look at, such as the foal panicing with a rope around it's neck, or the rider attemting Piaffe by using draw reins. Instead of buying this book, please buy one of Mark Rashid's books and learn how to be a good leader for your horse."
2,Don't be Fooled...NOT A SET!!,"Zevro Indispensable Spice Mill Set - Oatmeal...I received this spice mill 'set' today, and was surprised when I found only one mill in the box. The 'Product Features' state there are two, one with a black ring and one with a white ring. Further down the page 'Product Description' states: ""ZSM201 Includes only 1 Mill; Ring around center is actually BLACK."" Very confusing! I didn't read the product description, only the product features. I spoke with Wayfair (the distributor) and was told I could order another one at a 10% discount. With shipping it would be another $21 for what I thought I was getting in the first place when I paid $23! GRRR... A set means 2 not 1 and they refused to honor the item's title description. Bad customer relations in my opinion.I'll be WAYY more careful in the future whenever I buy something from another distributor through AMAZON."
5,Beautiful Blue Large Watch,"This is my fourth Citizen Eco-Drive Watch. I buy these watches because they never need batteries,keep great time and are very stylish. This design is lovely -- large oblong with big clear numbers and a blue leather croc look strap. It has a stainless steel case, very important for those of us who have allergies to metals such as nickle."
1,Not Jerry Jeffs best work!!!,Defiantly not Jerry Jeff's best work would be an under statement! This CD is not good jazz and does not reflect the Jerry Jeff Walker style of music that I have followed for years. A big disappointment for a big fan of Jerry Jeff!
1,Don't matter how you do it-,"JJ hisself said Just do it like you know it. This isn't like he knows it. Singing isn't really Jerry Jeff's forte, which makes it hard to get excited about hearing him sing Jazz covers badly that aren't all that good in the first place. But- Jerry Jeff audiences aren't hard to please. If he can make millions singing Redneck Mother enough times to engrain the noise patterns in the Austin Texas dirt he should be able to sell plenty of copies of this. Economics are a funny thing."
1,Kind of cheap.,"The material for this costume is cheap. I don't expect the highest quality from a costume, so I wasn't too surprised. The hat is cute, but the antlers don't stand up well."
2,Just curious...,"When Hemingway met with the man referred to as just the Arab in Frankfurt, were there any leftist talking points the Arab missed? I literally laughed when he said, ""You have only 5% of the world's population but consume 25% of the energy."" That was one of about twenty liberal talking points he managed to get out in about two pages. I felt embarrassed for the author after reading that exchange."
2,Justification for terrorists,"Baldacci, rather than just tell a good story, has his characters repeat and repeat the left-wing reasons why the terrorists are justified in hating and attacking the United States. Portions of this book must have been writen by George Soros or Alec Baldwin.I have enjoyed Baldacci's past books, but this is my last Baldacci."
2,Disappointing,"Having read other David Baldacci novels, I bought this expecting the same enjoyment I had reading them. I was disappointed indeed. The story is unrealistic and the plot is a muddle. It moves from one superficial character to another and from one incident to another without too much depth. Characters are under developed and weave in and out of the story without a connecting thread. Incidents and conversations happen without reason or explanation and kept me wandering what the logic was. Altogether, the story is wrapped in ambiguity. I kept on hoping it would get better further on, but reached the end without ever really enjoying it."
2,Camel Club dissapoints,"As I read this book I was rollng my eyes and thinking that it had to get better. This novel doesn't get better unfortunately, it just gets more hackneyed and contrived with an unmistakable antiAmercan slant that drips from the page after page. It seems as if Baldacci wrote ths one in about as much time as it took to read it. Wow was this bad."
2,Super preachy,"I've enjoyed the author's work in the past. However, in this book he can't help but preach his politics through his characters endless ramblings. I don't even care that he has a leftist streak, but it was waaaaay too much. Stick to the story, David."
3,"Good, but not top shelf","Baldacci can certainly spin a nice yarn, and he does so here. The plot is full of action, intrigue, and interesting twists. And the book is certainly timely in light of all the controversy surrounding America's real lifes spy agencies.But to enjoy the book, you simply have to suspend disbelief over an incredible sequence of it's-a-small-world-after-all coincidences required by the plot. And Baldacci also inserts a healthy dose of sermonizing against stereotyping the Islamic world into his characters' dialogue. While I appreciate and agree with everything he and his characters say in this respect, the sermonettes make for some awkward passages and stilted dialogue."
1,the unusual book i read,hi we are reading this book for our book club this book had me fall assleep while reading it since i am not fond of terrorism or violence since we live in a world like this so we all know the world is not a perfect place why expose adults and younger kids to this type of reading here i found this book awful and disrespectful and rude here but hey i am just a young adult college student here these books should be banned here since reading this book for a book club all i can say is yikes i'll never read another one like this one again!frommary
4,Get ready for an all-nighter...,"The central characters of this group are a rag-tag foursome who camp out in tents near the White House, and collectively call themselves the Camel Club. The group spends their days compiling and seeking the truth behind various conspiracy theories. One night they witness the execution-style murder of a Secret Service agent, and are soon thrust into the middle of their own conspiracy when they are marked for death themselves. An added backdrop to this novel is the planning of an unprecedented terrorist attack on American soil.I tell you this book grips you right from the beginning and it is VERY difficult to put it down, even when you want to! The plot is complex and there are a myriad of characters to sift through, but in the end it is well worth the time and effort. This is an extraordinary political thriller, great dialogue and very entertaining. Well worth the price, and may have you dreaming of your own conspiracy theories!!Cris Cunningham for Amazon.com"
5,Fast paced and realistic!,Finished this book in 3 days. It is an international espionage fun ride that is both realistic and still contemporary in 2011. I have to give this book 5 stars and hope one day to see it made into a movie.
3,Weak Ending,Compelling during first and middle portions of the book. Weak ending. Read like a story teller that could not find a way out of all of the problems that had been created.
2,"Good read, but dreadful ending","90% of this book is well structured and a really interesting read, unfortunately the last 10% when it is all being drawn together is dreadful. Some of the most predictable conclusions I have EVER read.The ending of the book read likes the most naff American movie drivle, it's as if he was deliberately writing if with the screenplay in mind and a half-hearted dramatic ending.Without wanting to spoil it for anyone, the line around ""bad atmospheric conditions in the atlantic"" made may laugh out loud as one of the most pathetic efforts at building suspense I have ever read, it was just SO predictable. If it ever gets made into a movie it'll be straight to DVD and straight into the bargain bucket."
4,"Good novel, nice group","Very good novel, nice characters, filled with action... Entertaining...I'm more in the climate created by authors like Indridason or Mankell, but for american novels, Baldacci is a very good choice. Now I'm reading The Winner... and I don't find it so good.. But he's a very good choice."
3,"Not David Baldacci's best, but still worth a read","I mostly agree with the other reviewers - the plot gets slowed or even derailed at times by excess information. However, I still finished it and liked it for what it was. It's one of those books with a fantastic concept, but not the best story execution."
2,Too many unbelievable moments to be good,"This was my second attempt at a book by David Baldacci, who I know is very popular. Sadly, I still don't know why that is. This novel, while interesting in its many sides of American/Muslim relations has so many impossible to believe moments and coincidental happenings that belief is totally suspended. The climatic ending actual reads like '80s GI Joe cartoon. That's probably too harsh but that's the first thing I thought. Another problem was the title/series itself is the ""Camel Club"" although the members save one are almost purposeless. So, I'm glad I read a novel by a popular author to see if I agreed and I simply don't. Skip it."
1,offensively idiotic,"I did not believe that anybody could match the idiocy of J.Patterson's books, now we have a very strong contender in the field."
3,Okay but not outstanding,"This is the third Baldacci novel I have read, and I approached it with high expectations. While this was still good escapist fiction, it lacked the cohesiveness and the directed energy of his other novels.Some great twists, some wonderful (black) humour but overall not great.There was enough there to keep me reading, and I'll certainly be reading his other novels as I come across them.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
1,I just couldn't pick it up!,"I read this book to the bitter, ridiculous end, but it was an excersise in discipline, patience and self-flagellation. I wanted to like it, but it was so un-engaging that I couldn't force myself to read more than about 25 pages at a time. Consequently, it took me about two weeks to make my way through this quagmire. That said, Bush-hating, blame-America-first Kosputin liberals will love it. One man's terrorist is another man's noble freedom fighter, you know.This was my first and last Baldacci book. I just can't believe that the author of this tripe could write anything worth my time. Try Vince Flynn, Joel Rosenberg or Oliver North."
2,Standard stuff maybe a little better,"The first half of the book seems kind of flat and he appears to telegraph the plot line, i.e. typical terrorist take over. However some of the characters do come thru with interesting hidden backgrounds, that prove vital to their survival. Again, in a somewhat tyipcal fashion and ""won't talk about it"" etc. Taking all that into account is was not bad but I will not be saving it to read again in the future."
1,major dissapointment,"The story line and the characters were nowhere near believeable. I thought as did another reviewer that this book was written by someone else. It went to the bestseller list based on the Baldacci name. That name has now been used to make political statements wrapped in a novel, and thats something that always annoys me when I read action fiction,whether I agree with the statements or not."
2,"Shallow, but somewhat entertaining","Written in multi-threaded, Tom Clancy style, Camel Club is an entertaining mystery if you can suspend disbelief at the ridiculous plot. The characters are shallow and pontificate in silly, left-wing drivel from time to time. Suspense keeps one turning the pages, but there is no lasting substance to the book. Good to read on an airplane, it will soon be forgotten."
1,The Camel Club,"What a disappointment. Page after page of Baldacci's personal political agenda. The message is government is not to be trusted, there really aren't any good guys left and US policy has been wrong since WWI when America dropped the bombs on Japan without thought for the millions who would suffer from fallout. It gets even worse, Jimmy Carter is the best US president ever and our National Security along with CIA and FBI are running rough shod over all those nice, peaceful, Muslims. He has always been an entertaining writer, but there is nothing here to entertain or call mystery. I've just bought my last Baldacci book. Maryrsunshine"
1,Writer sympathizes with Middle East/bash USA,This writer is not even close to Grisham in story telling talent. He uses shallow characters and a lame story to spout his USA bad/Middle East innocent opinion. It's all very tiresome. I stuck with it hoping the characters might blossom but they are way too weak. Don't waste your time. Get a Vince Flynn or John Grisham and enjoy a good story with interesting characters.
2,There's probably a decent short story here somewhere...,"There's just enough background information to make it seem plausible, but the wooden characters and the leaden writing make you want to throw the damn thing across the room.If it wasn't for the drywall repairs, I might not have minded this one."
1,Probably my last Baldacci book,"This was exciting book, no doubt about that. I did NOT like though the bashing of US in it. I have read all his other books and didn't see ultra liberal messages in them. I can get those messages from plenty of sources. I am vet of VN War and don't like this kind of far left garbage like is hinted and stated in this book. I wondered at times if moveon.org had written it. Thanks"
2,Cheap tricks,"My husband was raving about Baldacci's books so I finally decided to try one. I heard some vague rumors about the Camel Club being a timely story (it was an interview, I think), and the conspiracy afficionado that I am I picked it up. And then... I put it down after forcing myself to read through about 1/3 of the story. Now, I fullheartedly agree with those who describe America as the ultimate rogue who replaced the soviet as the number 1 evil and would've loved to read an intelligent, if fictional story about it. Unfortunatelly Camel Club read like something the author had tossed off over the weekend, with predictable and shallow characters and such poor writing it was hard to believe it came from somoeone who sold ""millions"" of books.This was my first and last Baldacci story."
2,Baldacci Blunders,"While the first 75% of the book kept the reader hooked, the last 25% was just bad writing from an author who should know better. The ending was pure fantasyland with Middle East ""terrorists"" only killing themselves, not the good guys(Americans). Come on David, most readers ain't that stupid too buy what you were trying to sell them.Great fiction must have characters and a plot that mirror real life stuff. Terrorists that dont't kill their enemy ain't believable, unless a reader's IQ level is 85 or that of a 2nd grade elementary school student."
4,Camel Club Action,"I always enjoy Baldacci novels and this was no exception. Lots of action and intrigue. Maybe not totally believable, but fun to read."
4,The Camel Club,"Good reading, Now I'm hooked on Baldacci and will have to get more of his novels. If they are as good as this one I won't be able to put them down."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have read all the Balducci books and this book was ""excruciating"" to read.I read 2/3 of the book and finally had to quit.Way too many unrelated characters and plots that never seem to mesh.How could the editors have ever allowed this talented writer to produce this poor piece of mystery."
2,OK. Not as good as his early Work,"I liked it better than the Hour Game, which was so slow I never finished it. Baldacci has unfortunately, like other authors gotten a little preachy. They disguise it as part of the story (as if their readers don't see it) but there are whole sections that flash ""Author's Message"" in neon lights. First, there are much subtler ways to send a message, second, I just don't like being preached at no matter if I agree or disagree with the message. I stopped reading Tom Clancy (opposite view) for just this reason."
3,Disappointing,The plot was just OK. DB tried to make too many political statements in the book. I bogged down in many places while the everyday life of terrorists was explained. He has done so much better in the past.
1,Balldacci obviously of the blame America crowd.,"I bought this book on my kindle thinking I was getting a political thriller,but a short way into the book I realized it was just a vehicle for his hate America , blame America views."
1,Still waiting,It is now a week and a half after the estimated delivery date and I have not received my book nor have I heard from the seller. Apparently I am not alone in getting this lousy service from this seller. I should have listened to the other reviews before placing my order. Shame on me.
5,Baldacci one of the best,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were vivid and interesting and the plot was filled with intrigue. I looked forward to my nightly read.
4,Mystery Lover,"Camel Club is a book that can not be put down. The author holds your attention, a page turner."
4,Mixed feelings,"After 2/3 through the book, I finally couldn't put it down. Too many main characters and not enough character development. Overall all, the book left me wanting more, but only because it didn't give quite enough. Still a decent read."
4,FICTION?,"I'm afraid this plot is not picturing ""fiction""...In todays world it could actually happen somewhere."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have been an avid David Baldacci reader these past years. His plots are unique and his characters have grit. His stories are thrillers and suspenseful.However, Camel Club appears to have been written by a political hack, in particular a left wing hack. The book is riddled with propaganda and leftist cliches that I almost threw the book in the trash.""Oliver Stone"" is the main character in the book, and it appears that Oliver Stone may have helped write the book."
2,More on the theme,"Baldacci joins a large rank of current authors who use their prose to spout the liberal view (over & over in Baldacci's case). While it is hard to tell where he stands in the book, I did skip the parts that went on & on about the poor muslim terrorists & what they have suffered. The story itself is plausible...a club that centers on conspiracy theories, an almost retired secret service agent, who is likeable...and several fanatics. I hope there is no truth in this story.Basically it doesn't make a lot of sense in the end...just goes on & on with the violence & subplots. Baldacci can do a lot better than this one. From now on I'll read books written before 2000...just enough already of the liberal ideology."
4,Constantly moving suspense,"I enjoy David Baldacci's work as I like escapist spy stories. The Camel Club is the name of a group of friends who investigate incidents of national security that they become aware of. They use their multiple skill sets and past experiences to solve strange happenings. This one begins with the accidental discovery of a body by the members of the club and the subsequent life and death adventures they get into as they race to solve the crime, save their loved ones and dismantle the larger terrorist plot."
4,"Slow start, satisfying ending","Thought it was a great read. The characters were compelling and the story, although, it started off slow, had a very satisfying ending.-WG"
2,Too Slow,When the author when into a two+ page tangent on the Library of Congress he lost me. The first 100 pages don't move. I quit at p. 107. Several of his earlier works were much better.
2,Absurd Plot,"It has been mentioned by MANY others already, but I had to voice my displeasure of the book.The plot has so many forced twists and suprises it takes away from some pretty intersting parts of the books. 1/2 of them are pointless to the story, it seems like Baldacci just couldn't help himself from adding 1 more twist. Then he could help himself again. 7 twists later the book ends.Also, some things are just not plausible even for this type of book genre. I can't give it away but for those who read it - it could never happen.This is my first Baldacci book. Others have said his earlier works are good, but it will be a while before I go back to him, if ever"
3,"A Good read, but not his best.","The Camel Club is a Baldacci thriller that does not stand up to his other writings. Though an enjoyable read, I cold not read in this in one evening as I usually do with his books. I did not find this a fast read. And it may be because the author tries to fit all the agencies and use current events as a background into one book. And a very unbelievable ending. This is a book you should just borrow from the library. Reading a bad book by David Baldacci is better then most books written in this genre.The characters are not well developed. The Camel club consists of four eccentric, yet intelligent, conspiracy theorists. One of who lives in a tent across the street from the White House. A sign hangs on his tent, ""I want the Truth."" And as can be expected, they are the eyes in which this story unfolds. With all that said, these four characters would be interesting to watch in a movie."
2,Lazy Writing,"The first 300 pages of this book aren't too bad, although the author's opinions about how to fight Islamic terrorism are all too evident. But, the last 100 pages seem like they were written by an absolute amateur: plot twists that are just too convenient to allow credibility.Not a total waste of time, but close."
2,"Great if you agree with every liberal talking point, if not stay away","This book would have been enjoyable had it not been filled with every liberal/blame-America/anti-US military talking point from the last 40 years. If you hate America, this is the book for you. Otherwise, stay away (like I wish I had done)."
2,Not up to his usual standards,"Unlike his previous books this one was tough to believe. While some of the material in the past books stretched the possibility, this one was over the top. It took me 3 months of trying to get through this."
1,Worst Book Ever,"David Baldacci is going to be rich, once he sues the 12-year-old who wrote this book using his name. That's the only plausible explanation I can come up with as to how Baldacci could possibly have written such an awful novel.You think my explanation is silly? You won't like this book then, because every single idea in it is worse than silly. The plot is a mess, the dialogue is attrocious, the characters are tired and cliche, and the worst part is that the author is capable of so much more.Don't waste your time on this one - you'll never get those hours back."
1,Terrible read,"I was unable to get more then three quarters of a way through the book. I liked the other book that I read which was written by him, but this one has turned me off on him for the rest of my life. Straight up liberal propaganda. The United States created terrorists. America bad, terrorists misunderstood. No thanks ever again Dave."
3,Thought provoking,"A fast moving mystery that leaves the reader questioning the creditability of every government organization. The in depth descriptions of some of these three lettered named government groups does not deter from the overall plot, but actually adds to the flow. The characters come alive with the author's colorful descriptions.Baldacci paints a beautiful portrayal of how power can be intoxicatingly corrupt. An entertaining and thought provoking read with just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you turning the page."
3,Camel Club,"While I really enjoyed the book, it was definitely not in ""new"" condition. It was very much a used book that the seller sold under ""new"". The other book I purchased from a different Amazon sourch was ""The Collectors"" and it definitely was a new book. The difference in the shape of these two books was pretty substantial. With that being said, the story was very good - another great book from David Baldacci."
3,Great Read,"Really enjoyed this thriller. The story involves several characters, most strangers to each other at the beginning but Baldacci brillantly brings each character into play as their paths cross for a surprising ending."
3,Spend a little time at a shooting range.,"He says some silly things about guns. In Absolute Power the shooter liked to use a .460 Weatherby Magnum. Silly!And in Camel Club the guy is wasted with a .22 revolver loaded with jacketed bullets! Huh?Then there is the deal about two guys carrying an unconscious victim a considerable distance in a tarp. Just try it. And then one pulls a boat out of his pocket big enough to carry the three of them and, by the way, has an amazing silent motor to power it. Tom Swift stuff.But it's still a pretty good read."
2,Can't Get Started,"I'd read all of David Baldacci's novels and anticipated settling down for a good long read, however, that wasn't the case. This is my second time starting this book and I just can't get past the first few chapters. It just doesn't hold my attention like his previous titles. For those of you reading Baldacci for the first time please don't let this novel turn you off to his other titles. I started reading his books after seeing the movie Absolute Power with Clint Eastwood. Absolute Power was his first novel and after reading that I was hooked. Several of his novels have reached number 1 on the NY Times bestseller list. I'm hoping that his next book will restore my faith in him."
1,Disappointing,"I was a Baldacci fan until I read this book. However, his page after page of Anti-American, pro-Muslim preaching and juvenile political rhetoric finally got to be just too much of a distraction. His book ended up in the trash and his name off my must buy list. Very sad, the plot had much promise but could not compete with the rhetoric."
1,Hollywood bound for sure!,"This book is the most anti-American book I have ever read. I'm sure the ""New York Times"" will love it. Not only is it poorly written, it fails to ever get off the ground as a ""thriller."" Thriling it is not. The characters are flat and their dialog so stilted to the left that they all sound like Cindy Sheehan. This anti-American tripe is so far out that it will no doubt be scooped up by Hollywood as it continues to advance the political agenda of the far left. My copy is going straight into the trash; I would hate to have a part in the distribution of this worthless rubbish. What happened to the David Baldacci I used to read and love? I guess Hollywood got to you too."
4,The Camel Club,"This Kindle eBook was very interesting. I had read the other Camel Club books by David Baldacci prior to reading this 1st one! Baldacci is a great mystery writer. I would have read it as a library loan, but there was too long a line to wait for it as my first wait was about two months, so I purchased it from Amazon.com."
3,Politics is Dangerous to a Thriller Writer,"David Baldacci is a wonderful story teller and he continues to use that ability in this book. However, in this book he has a message which is that America has to be more understanding of the Muslem world and that world peace requires mutual respect. Unfortunately he does not have the depth or ability to make this argument and he lets his political views get in the way of a good story with some of his wonderful characters. There are too many speeches and too many unbelievable coincidences.Baldacci has had the ability to paint wonderful characters. In this book Lucky and the background of the members of the Camel Club are interesting.As one reviewer said a weak Baldacci is still worth while but not nearly as satisfying as the real thing."
3,It is only fiction.,"Fiction: ""An imaginative creation or a pretense that does not represent actuality but has been invented.""This book is a work of Fiction and obviously the characters are imagery and the plot is unrealistic and is not meant to be taken seriously. (Unlike some of the other reviewers who took it seriously)But then again, that's what fiction is - a pretense that does not represent actuality.I picked up this book just to read it and entertain my mind. I read it, finished it, and kept it aside. That's it!Although I must point out that there are better thrillers out there.This one is just OK.Oh! and if you are a Bill O'Rielly fan...don't bother reading this one."
1,"Preachy, tedious, and difficult to finish","I felt like I was in a freshman seminar at UC Berkely and couldn't wait for class to end. There was not a single liberal soapbox missed: from the dangers of the Patriot Act to the inhumanity of the meat packing industry to racism in the US to the 'rogue elephant' of the intelligence community (hey, even Frank Church admitted he was wrong on that one David) to the evils of Christianity...I could go on, but why bother. Read the NYT or watch CNN and you pretty much have Baldacci's research. His hero has even oh so wittily dubbed himself ""Oliver Stone,"" a truth seeker. This is just pitiful. I only gave the book one star because the story wasn't bad; however, it could have been written in 200 rather than 400 pages without the ridiculous and pedantic ravings of a rather inept author. This was my first and last Baldacci."
3,Too political,"For the most part I found the book to be enjoyable and a good read, however I can't remember his prior books being so overly left-wing and preachy. Those parts of the story stand out like the worm in an apple. Unfortnately, these propaganda rantings went on for pages and when Balduacci returned to the plot, I couldn't remember what was going on.I used to enjoy John Grisham books as well but I know longer read them due to his ""preachy"" stories. My advice to David is get back to the good stories and leave the politics to the talking heads."
3,The Camel Club,"The Camel Club was a very different approach to the routine mystery story. I found it easy to read, and compelling in it's plot Since I am a senoir citizen, it was comforting to find an older hero, and I hope his group will follow their curiosity, and find another mystery in the near future."
5,One of my favorite authors,"One of my favorite authors has done it again. I love the excitement and the stories of the Camel Club. I read them out of order, but found them easy to follow and very exciting. I have enjoyed reading everyone of them."
2,Some good but mostly BORING,Too LONG. The plot was slow and confusing . One of the most boring Baldacci books I have read. Extremely disappointed.....a waste of money.
2,Join the Hate America Club,"Another liberal viewpoint on how bad America is -- Regardless of what the middle eastern terrorists did in the book --the U.S. was equally or often more at fault and responsible for the evil deeds bestowed upon us. I found myself getting angry for most of the book. All the bad guys were Americans, connected to our terrible government. The thing I don't understand is if the U.S. is so bad -- authors should stop tring to make a buck off the terrible folks.The story was a little far fetched, and the book made a lot of leaps connecting a murder to a plot to kidnap the president. I am really not sure how the Camel Club figured it all out except they had to or the book would never end!I used to be a great Baldacci fan in his earlier days and this is one of the few I have purchased in the recent past based on positive reviews. Overall I was disappointed."
1,Little More than a thick politcal tract,"If you view the U.S.and the War on Terror through Michael Moore style coke-bottle glasses, you might like this book. I don't and didn't. Even sophomoric politics aside, the book lacked the novelization and plot skills of a Lescroart, Connolloy, W.E.B. Griffin, Grisham (most of the time) etc.I gave up reading it halfway through. Just seemed a little too contrived and I was put off my his anti-American bent. In this, it seems little different than other of Baldacci's book which I seem to toss before getting to the middle of the book. And that's where this book's heading."
1,Let's all bash America?,"It's too bad this very clever writer had to spoil the story by saturating it with his anti-America viewpoint, especially on pgs.308 thru 311. Having read every one of his books, I expected to enjoy The Camel Club as much as the others but instead it made me angry and very disappointed."
1,pathetic,"The Winner and Absolute truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world."
1,STABBED IN THE BACK,"This book ended in the trashbin. We feel betrayed, stabbed in the back by another of our favorite authors. After spending good money to buy his book, based on our enjoyment of earlier books, we are subjected to a political diatribe. Maybe these aging authors realize they are not going to be here forever and feel the need to inflict their personal agendas on their trusting fans while they can. It would be more honest to write non-fiction."
1,Over-inflated,"It's too bad Baldacci wasted his considerable talent on this book. All I have to add to the negative reviews is that I found my puppy chewing on this novel after I reached the half-way point. While I view the destruction of a written work as a sin, I wish I'd gotten the hint."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"I don't write many reviews but I felt that I HAD to for this horrible piece of crap! How can a major publisher allow a book like this to be released? With it's ridiculous plot, incredibly boring dialogue, and horrible characters it's like reading something written by a dim-witted high school english student.Bottom line: Reading ""The Camel Club"" was a very painful experience and should never be done by anyone!"
3,Not the Best Baldacci.,"It's too political at times, which gets confusing, but at least he gives you more of a glimpse into the world of different Islamic sects, something most people think doesn't exist. Some of the villains are just too unreal to be believed, but I liked the characters that made up the Camel Club enough to want to see them again. I hope The Collectors is a step up, because it involves them again, and ""Oliver Stone"" is a pretty awesome group leader."
3,"Pretty good read, it started slow, but really picked up....","The author certainly has his political thoughts and agenda, which is fine, but it was clearly out there....The book was fast paced, but not totally believable....."
4,A Good Read,"Most government spy thrillers are boring to me, but by using the odd characters who somehow got together and formed ""The Camel Club"" it had a more interesting feel to it. The ending was a little far-fetched, but the author made you care very much for the characters and what would happen to them. For that and the fact that the last 1/3 of the book was a page-turner, I gave the book an above-average 4 stars."
1,Not one of his best,"I am a big fan of Baldacci, and the plot of this book is awesome, however, too much information at the beginning makes this a slow read and easy to figure out the end halfway through the book."
4,Not his best but entertaining,"I don't think this is his best work because he did get away from the plot and tended to get preachy. The book started off very slow for me but picked up about a fourth of the way through. He stretched some of the plot twists a little far, but for the most part it kept me entertained."
3,D. B. Does it again!!,"In typical Baldacci fashion the reader is swept onto a roller coaster of action, suspense and murderous intent with most sides; the Americans, Iraqis, North Koreans, Persians clearly intent on massive death and destruction. Then, Deus Ex Machina! Baldacci does it again when he unfortunately uses the very same devices he used in an earlier book, also about the Secret Service, to carry the plot forward. After this disappointment, I found it hard to continue to the predictable end. Maybe, David should get to know another Service Branch of our government for fresh story and or plot ideas."
3,Not the author's best work,"In this time of anti-Arab sentiment, David Baldacci should be credited here for featuring some muslims capable of acting in less than totally villainous ways. The quality of the writing is certainly adequate to the task of this sort of action novel, and the story steps along briskly. The plot and the action are a bit implausible, but that's what escapist novels are for, if the implausibility is kept within bounds. Anyway, the other qualities of the book make it overall a fun read. The members of the Camel Club are certainly interesting enough to warrant another story."
1,What a diatribe!,"I did think something was going to happen to overturn the pro-terrorist leanings of the book. But it never happened, and I'm more than 1/2 way thru. I'm done. I will never finish this book."
4,Camel Club,"Enjoyed the book. I enjoy books that make me want to continue reading even when I have something else to do. This book was fun, not especially difficult to follow and very simple words. The history lesson that each of Baldacci's books gives you is an extra. It was fun to read."
2,"Blah, unfortunately","Well - i kept seeing these Baldacci books, and figured i'd give them a try. I started with the one, forget the title, where Stone teams up with the female who reunites with her father, who is being hunted by the casino boss guy...well, that was a solid book, so i thought i'd backtrack and read some earlier ones by Baldacci. The Simple Truth was also a worthy effort. But then, i read Camel Club - i was curious as to the origins of Oliver Stone and his little band of friends. This book was average. I'd give it 2.5 stars. The character Hemingway was interesting, but Stone/Carr was pretty dull. There are flashes of intrigue and great reading, but they are few and far between. I was also reading another book called Term Limits by Vince Flynn, and it's far superior."
3,Not bad,"Since the copy I am currently reading--at exactly the mid-point of the book--was found in a New York City subway car I can't complain about the price. This is the first David Baldacci book I've read, so I'll take other reveiwers' word that he has done better.All in all, while I agree with many comments regarding the plethora of characters and seemingly implausible plot line(s), it is a pleasant enough book, certainly an engaging beach read. I AM glad, however, that I didn't have to buy it in hardcover."
4,A Club Worth Joining,"The Camel Club by David Baldacci, was my first Baldacci book. I was thoroughly entertained. There have been numerous writers that insert some of their own political views in their books; in fact, it is safe to say that most do. With that said... who cares. Seems to me that the writer of a book can write about whatever they want. The Camel Club is a truly entertaining book with a cast of memorable and eccentric characters. Based on the sheer fun I had reading this book; I will be working my way through the entire Baldacci collection.Four stars, highly recommended."
2,CAMEL CLUB IS NOT A 'WINNER',"A group of conspiracy theorists witness a murder set up to look like a suicide, and become enmeshed in the most convoluted and unlikely series of events imaginable. Rueben Rhodes, Caleb Shaw, Milton Farb, and their illustrious leader ""Oliver Stone"" do battle with the evil ""Captain Jack"", not to mention Muslim terrorists, and factions of the U.S. government. If you think this tale sounds like it is better suited to a comic book....your right!For a Baldacci novel with a better story as well as characters you care about, try ""THE WINNER""......it's a goldmine of good writing."
1,Unreadable,"I had to stop reading this book at page 118, as there are just too many ridiculous, unrealistic, and unecessary conversations between far too many ill-conceived and unlikely characters. I bought this at random at an airport out of sheer boredom, but I would rather do just about anything else rather than read this book."
5,Really enjoyed this one...,"Really enjoyed this book and I am placing orders for the next 2 that follow. This was the first ""serious"" book that I have read in years (since college) and I must say it was great. I endured a few late nights as I didn't want to put the book down. I just finished the book and I am sad that I don't have the next one to start reading right away."
3,Enjoyable thriller if you can ignore the talking points,"This is my first Baldacci read, and Camel Club was enjoyable enough to pick up more of his books. One of my favorite genres is the political/espionage/thriller, and this has a good balance of technical info, action, and character development. You do engage with the characters and that allows you to get past some of the wordy or improbable parts.Unfortunately this book suffers from a common fault of many writers in that Baldacci rolls out a lot of the worn out political talking points for texture rather than actually creating real back story. One character is angry because his army unit was decimated by Agent Orange; another character loved ""Ronnie"" Reagan but thought Jimmy Carter was the best president ever; the American invasion of Iraq turned Baghdad into a ""constant fireball,"" etc.Just skip over the political commercials and you will enjoy this book. It's a great beach read."
2,"okay, not great","I had a tough time keeping all of the characters straight when I first started to read the book. Thought that some of the story lines were a little far fetched and somewhat boring. I kept wondering when the book would come together, there seemed to be 3 different plots going on. It's an okay book, not great, I almost gave up on reading it, only reason I kept on going was because I wanted to get my money's worth and atleast finish the book."
4,Held my attention to the end.,"Like most Baldacci books this one is longer than it should be but it held my interest on a long drive. With the distractions of driving while listening, the unabridged book is best as you can 'miss' some of it and still keep the flow going. Well spoken audio book worth the money."
2,pass this up...,"This was my first Baldacci audiobook. It seems I picked poorly. I agree with the other reviews that bring up the unbeliveability of the plot, but that was not the worst thing about this book. There were way too many conversations had by characters that were incongruous. When you find yourself saying, ""why are these guys talking about this, it makes no sense"", then there is trouble. Most of these conversations were to bring background (and i guess Baldacci was going for depth in his characters) but were just boring. Why would the director of a national spy agency and his right hand man have a conversation about ""hey, remember when we had all this trouble getting all the spy databases together?"" It's like they are reminiscing about old times in a part of the story when they should be talking seriously. blah blah blah. One could be overlooked, but there are many conversations in this story that could be left out and the book would be better. Maybe the abridged version is better :)"
2,Intricacies within Intricacies,"This one tended to be dizzying, with its involuted, convoluted, prevoluted, and retrovoluted wad of plot lines. My limitted unravelling skills were overwhelmed by the tangle. Hard to keep track of who's who in the zoo, and, of why one should care. Weirdly, there seemed to be magical cross-linkages, and major difficulties impossibly easy to overcome in the midst of simple but immovable obstacles. Love sprang suddenly and unquestioningly to life across the crowded bar, just in time to thicken the mix. I wouldn't go to the movie."
1,Read by the River,"I have enjoyed all of Baldacci's previous books, but I simply could not get through this one. It is marred by the rapid introduction of many similar characters and frequent pauses to blame Americans for vitually everything that is a problem on this planet. All of the American characters are, at best, vacuous and self-absorbed, or are members of U.S. intelligence agencies who routinely commit assassination and other mayhem to further American interests. All of the Muslim characters are pure and devout but forced into extremism by American misdeeds. A sophomoric and annoying book."
2,Political Views of the author?,"Camel Club isn't one of Baldacci's best BY FAR. The story is more of a comic book creation of hi-level government spooks and how they can do anything, merely by saying it's available via the computer databases.Also, Baldacci devotes an inordinate amount of space to muslim criticism of the many faults of the USA, thus justifying their crimes. Maybe Baldacci is grooming himself for employment by the New york Times?But if you like fiction with heroes who are never seriously harmed, though taking on insurmountable odds, this is for you."
4,Gotta love The Camel Club,"I gave Camel Club 4 stars because I love the action, plot twists, and total interaction of the characters. Oliver Stone and his crew keep your interest and heart rate elevated from page 1. The whole series is a must read for lovers of exciting action fiction."
3,Gripping but unbelievable and TOO political,"Baldacci should stick to writing fun thrillers that stay out of the political arena with his commentary about terrorism, islam, etc."
2,Disappointing,Baldacci has a great plot but the follow through is boring and not worth the effort: there is poor character development and too many strange and quirky characters. With a lot of editing and streamling it might make a good two hour movie for TV.
2,Medicore Effort,"This is the first book I've read by Baldacci and it will probably be the last. While the book overall may be good enough to pass the time on a rainy day, the plot and characters are constructed in such a sloppy manner it comes off as very amateurish. The terrorist plot in this work requires so many things to happen just right that it simply blows any ""willing suspension of disbelief"" out of the water. The entire effort seems to be nothing more than a mechanism to serve up the author's political views in a convenient manner, even down to the fact that Baldacci's terrorists use only sedative-laced darts instead of bullets so as not to actually harm anyone. (What exactly do Al Quaeda, Huzballah and other terrorist organizations have to do to convince the left that maybe, just maybe, they are dangerous?) Anyway, there are an infinite number of better reads than this on the bookshelves; pass this one by unless you just love Baldacci."
2,Starts great then crashes and burns!,"Baldacci has written some of the best thrillers of the past decade, almost all rating 5 stars. But ""The Camel Club"" has hit the wall. The first 250 pages are traditionally pure Baldacci, and promise a great read. But it ends there, it is almost as though he has written himself into a corner and suspended all rational, logical plotting thoughts and threw in a ludicrous set of plot points that just didn't quite seem possible. The idea of the Camel Club I felt, right from the get go was a terrific means of getting into a high tension thriller, much like ""Absolute Power"", but then, it fizzled to a point where I almost could be pursuaded to believe someone who had never written a work of fiction had been handed the task of completing the book in record time and simply lost interest in the project."
2,A highly populated conspiracy,"Four D.C. area wacky people, starring the brilliant, brave, misunderstood Oliver Stone, uncover an amazingly complex, cast hundreds of Muslims, who plan to kidnap the president on the occasion of his birthplace changing the town's name to his name. This is the first time I have been disappointed with a David Baldacci novel. Was he trying to write a farce?"
3,Ok but end of novel seemed rushed,"The Camel Club was entertaing for the most part. The first 70 percent of the novel was suspenseful but after that it kind of went downhill. It became boring, tedious and seemed almost as if the end was rushed by the author."
2,disappointed in Baldacci,"This is the first book I have read by David Baldacci. I had been anxious to read him because friends of mine really like his books. So when our book club selected ""The Camel Club"" for our May choice, I was really happy about it. But, boy, was I disappointed. Some of the other members of our book club felt the same way. I guess we started with the wrong book. But now I am not anxious to read any other books by him.JFFontenot"
4,Camel Club,It was imaginative and well 'put together'. Real world characters. He kept you interested.
3,Scavengers will save the world?,"As many Baldacci's books the end of it lacks in inspiration and when you finish a book and the end just bores you it doesn't matter how the rest of the book was. You'd remember the last you read and you won't like the reading very much.Maybe what says this book is true, but you'll really believe it? I really don't think so. So if you want to read a so-so book you can read this one and maybe learn some of the new venues that has the government to defend the world, so to speak.Queries:Why Hemingway made that plot?What he wanted to demonstrate?Why the North Koreans wanted to kill the president?Why they killed Patrick Johnson?"
1,NEGATIVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE,I still have not received my product. This has been the WORST experince that I have ever had on amazon!!!!!!!
1,poorly reasearched and written,"First let me say that I have liked ""Last man standing"" and ""Split Second"" by Baldacci. Camel Club is a hack effort. Having terrorist that don't kill? Nuclear warfare that looses communication and has no redundancy? A bad guy (Carter Grey) who pays for- killing the lead characters family (Oliver Stone), ruining countless lives, and wants to kill the president- his major act of redemption is resignation??? Aldelphia is never really explained and developed as a charachter. why is she so anti-abortion? I was very disapointed."
1,Politically Unappealing,"Having taken a few days to let the disappointment pass, I will concede that the story and characters are interesting, but it is all a bit scattered. The politics contained in this novel are completely one-sided which I believe makes it less interesting.It never lives up to its potential and interesting characters are wasted with story telling that focuses more on the politics of the author than the drama of the situation."
2,We are the bad guys,"If you like conspiracy theories where the US government is the bad guy, then this is for you."
2,Poor access to the charcoal pan,"Just finished cooking a chicken on this. It was hard to maintain a good temperature (today was about 70 degrees and sunny, almost no wind) and working on the coals through the small door is hard at best.So I don't recommend this model. If your interested in a smoker, I'd recommend moving up a level to a model that gives better access to the charcoal pan. I'd return this model if I could but I don't think they'll take it back now that I've used it - so I guess I'm stuck with it. There is a video on ""youtube"" that shows a guy modify this to make it work for him, maybe I'll try that.I also don't like that the temperature gauge in it doesn't give you the temperature. Instead it has 3 zones on it - warm, ideal and hot. Not very useful - so now I have to buy another gauge to tell me what the temperature is."
3,Its ok,"We got this grill for a present so I was not complaining. Assembly was very easy and all around it looks nice. Using it as a smoker is a little difficult because it does not stay hot, not enough air circulation. You will bump into the same problem when you try to to use it as a grill. The coals go out very quickly so you have to work quickly."
1,brickman smoker/grill,Not what I expected an open bottom not good for smoking and no air vents to control you temp. No grates for air flow even just grillingI returned it.
5,Super good smoker,I bought this to replace one I've had for 20+ years. Nothing wrong with it but in moving lost 2 grates and not able to find a replacement size to fit ? So out with old and in with the new.
3,This smoker needs improvements,"I have owned this smoker for a year and a half now, but after today's experience, I thought I needed to review it.This morning, I put a 14lb. pork shoulder on to smoke. Firstly, the thermometer built in is extremely unreliable. It said ""warm"" the whole time, when I KNEW it wasn't ""warm."" Then, after replacing the charcoal tray 4 times in 2 hours, I decided it was a waste of money.The only way we can get this smoker to work is with a certain modification that allows us to lift the smoker off the charcoal pan (which is sitting on bricks)and then having a box fan on high to keep the coals ignited.It's yours to purchase or not. We are going to buy a different smoker soon!"
1,Avoid this smoker!,"There are no vents to adjust airflow, or to allow smolder out rather than ruin your meat.If you're trying a long smoke, you have to disassemble the entire thing to add coal, again ruining the temp of your smoker and the quality of your cook.If you're trying a slow smoke, you have to stick your arms and face down inside the unit to pull out the coal and wood when the cook is over. This is a hazard to your arms, your face, your body hair, your clothing!Really, this product should not even be legal to sale."
5,Father's Day Gift,"This smoker was a gift from my children to their dad. My husband had owned a smoker before. He was in need of another. This smoker was perfect. He especially likes the temperature gauge which he didn't have on the other. The price was so great in comparison to the pricing of other smokers. I would highly recommend this to other avid ""smokers."""
5,Great Product,This is my 3rd Brinkman. Have yet to wear one out. My son appropriated one and another was the closer on our california house sale. I tried a few other devices for our Texas Smoked Rough Brisket but the Brinkmn is essentioal!
3,A little bummed,"Received the clocked yesterday, it was a gift for a friend. It came preset and running and was just as it was represented but, I couldn't help but feel that for almost thrity dollars it should have been more. It's small and seems to me at least, that fifteen bucks is a more realistic price.That said, my friend loved it ( she has no idea what it cost ) and I guess that's all that matters.P.S. Mine is white , not black."
1,Wish I could return this,"I bought this in October, but did not try it out because I was waiting to use it for our Santa countdown. I wish I would have opened it and tried it out. It was hard to get it to set to the right time and it is very small. I was very disappointed when I finally opened it in December, but by then, Amazon would not let me return it. There are better countdown timers out there and I plan to find another one for next year!"
5,Amazing hints,I read this book on the advice of others and found it to be fascinating in its content. Do not be mislead by the title. The contents are helpful and link cognitive therapy with hands-on methods.
3,Which tape was that part on again?,"I think this must be a great book, but the audio tapes are confusing. I relisten to them and take notes, but wish I had bought the book instead. These tapes need a booklet or visual aid to refer to. The information is really interesting and the techniques are powerful stress reducers. Get the book."
1,Don't buy the tape buy the book,I have not bought the book but I intend to. The audio tape set is too confusing without any illustrations included in the box. In my opinion this is a huge marketing mistake. It made me give up and return the tape to Amazon. I had more emotional healing needs after trying to follow the tapes!!! At one point the authors even refer to the illustrations which had me turning the box upside down thinking I must have missed it. Tapes are really valuable for sight- impaired people and/or audio learners like myself. If you are interested buy the book and Good Luck!
1,Don't bother,"This book is crap. Try Glenn Harrold's ""Overcome The Fear of Flying"" instead. It relies more on controlling your breathing, which works better."
5,hooked on david leitz,"I've been fishing for some years, but I'm just learning to fly fish. Found this while browsing on the internet, ordered it, read it -- and the hook was set. I'm now reading my second Leitz fly-fishing novel, and have just ordered my third over the internet. Good, fun, interesting characters; basic plots might be a little dated, but that really doesn't matter. Characters develop, relationships wax and wane, plots thicken, with good twists and surprises; I recommend these books to non-fisherpeople, beginning fly-fishing people, and I'll expect the expert who's teaching me to fly fish will enjoy them too when I pass them on to him!"
1,Please--no more Eve Duncan books!,"This will be the last Iris Johansen book I'll ever read. The author undoubtably has some serious issues with male-female relationships. Eve Duncan is what my late husband called a p---- teaser. At least Johansen is good at character development. She makes Eve so stubborn, willful and downright obnoxious I just want to throttle her. The constant petty bickering between her and both John Logan and Joe Quinn is so annoying I wanted to scream! How can anyone enjoy a book when the main character, the heroine, is so despicable? All the arguing, etc., completely destroyed any enjoyment of the story for me. Do us a favor, Ms. Johansen, don't bring Eve Duncan back for another encore."
3,Fast read,"This book is perfect for waiting in line for the ferry or killing time at the airport. It doesn't take a whole lot of concentration and the plot is interesting enough to keep your attention.While the title implies some pretty gritty stuff, it turns out this is more of a suspenseful romance novel than a grim murder mystery. Although the heroine is being hunted by while hunting for a serial killer, there aren't tremendously gruesome and gratuituous descriptions of the killings which is a relief.The plot is moved along primarily through the use of dialogue which makes for fast and easy reading. And while there aren't a whole lot of surprises in here (I mean does Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis ever actually die in their movies?), the ending was a nice little twist and Johansen does a good job of defining characters deftly with minimum words.Not a deep book by any means, but a decent and quick read."
2,Not very exciting,"This is my first book by the author, and it will be my last. I found Joe's 'protectivness' to be rather creepy. Eve, who is made out to be a strong and together woman, is easily influenced and breaks down often. The killer is obvious upon your first meeting of him. All in all, a very hard book to stay focused on, due to the irritating and shallow dialouge. Not a good read."
1,"Dumb, dumber, dumbest!","This has to be the most unbelievable premise for a book. What a waste of energy. Who could possibly believe Eve's involvement in this farce without the benefit of the sanction of the authorities. Secondly, who would allow her to conduct her own personal investigation with her closeness to the killer in relationship to her daughter's death. Also, no one is ever monitoring the calls on the digital. Eve simply reiterates what is said when she feels ""up to it."" Give me a break. This heroine is no heroine. Boring at best."
4,An Excellent Read,"Ranked against Iris Johansen's other works The Killing Game ranks up in the top. Johansen sticks to the theme of the unknown darkness throughout the book. Her many twists, turns, and backtracks keeps the reader avidly turning the pages. She develops each character relatively well, except for a few. This underdevelopment, however, is essential to the plot and climax of the book. Overall The Killing Game is a well written mystery/suspense novel with a splash of romance added in."
4,A Great Suspense Story!,The Killing Game is a wonderful continuation of the story started in The Face of Deception. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and I couldn't put it down. The ending was a real surprise!
4,Unusual style,"This author displays such a varied range. The reader is quickly drawn into the story. Caught up in a web of intrigue and consumed with a conflicting desire. As with any truly good book, the reader wants to end the torment and have all questions answered; on the other hand, the realization that the reader is right smack in the middle of a well crafted story lends one to procrastinate the consumation. Don't take my word for it. Experience it for yourself."
1,This is definitely Not the Iris I know!,"I hate to say this, but I really HATE her recent novels! So long, draggy, impersonal and VERY,VERY BORING! I'm sure a new direction is good, but I think she should concentrate on what she is good at. When I got my hands on this book, I was anticipating a good book, like the many good books precedenting this one. However this was a BORE! I gave up in frustration halfway through the book. People, spare your time ,and don't read this.It's so agonizing that a trip to the dentist seems like a better idea!Iris was and still is one of my favourite writers, I just wish she'd write something befitting of her talent again!"
2,Only the dog saved this book.,"Like other reviewers, I too am tired of whiney Eve. She and Joe have the same argument over and over and over and over. Blah, blah, blah. The only thing that saved it and the reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 was the appearance of Sarah Patrick and her wonder dog, Monty. I'll read the reviews for the next one in the series and if it seems to be the same old story, I'll skip it."
3,regular ol' mystery,"Don't get me wrong, the Killing Game was a good book. But it was just another ol' mystery like all the thousands of others. There wasn't anything unique about it. It's the same old ""There's a happy woman--Then man comes and haunts her--Woman tries to figure out who he is--Man threatens to kill somebody else--She must save this somebody else--The man schedules to meet her--The man meets her--somebody saves the day and everybody goes home happy"" basic idea. What I would like to see in a murder mystery would be the killer getting away and nobody finding out. We could still know who he is maybe because, like the Killing Game, the killer schedules to meet his ""prey"", but just don't have anyone save the day. If the killer would actually kill the main character it would be unique, but the Killing Game was just another regular ol' mystery where somebody saves the day."
1,Disappointing.,"I really enjoyed ""The Face of Deception."" Sorry to say that I can't endorse this sequel as heartily (at all, for that matter). The main female character (Eve) doesn't seem to have emotionally changed one iota in the year since we left her in the first book. She also seems to have become whiny and a user of men to boot.I felt that little time and/or effort was put into character development or even scenic description, and the book was sloppily plotted from a technology standpoint...caller ID or *69, anyone! In the real world, the authorities would've scooped Dom up like a roach ten minutes after he made his second phone call to Eve.This book read like it was written in a rush - the curse of authors who, once they attain a certain level of market success, must produce new 'product' quickly to keep their readers happy. I'm glad I borrowed this product from the library so I can return it.Take your time, Iris. We'll wait! :-)"
3,"Enough already, no sequel please","I was looking forward to reading the Killing Game, I believe it would tie the loose ends of Face of Deception. Eve is a woman that women love to hate, you just want to shake her. She's crazy, I can't image losing a child in the matter that she did, but as I read the book I kept on thinking this woman really needs a therapist. She a user, and can't see pass her obsession to bring her child's bones home. She doesn't care about anyone, and uses the excuse that she went thru a lot to cover her selfishness... The dialogue in this book is unbelievable... It is also unrealistic, the hero waits for the woman for 10 years, and is still waiting, WOW! The one good thing about this book is that it's a fast-pace book, a good read while on a plane.I used to like Iris Johansen, but since she wrote Ugly Ducking her books have pretty much the same premise. I feel that I'm reading the same story over and over with each of her books. Just the characters change a bit..."
5,Killing Game,"This book kept me on the edge of my chair, and the ending I did not see coming! Enjoyed it very much."
4,Tension,"I liked the book very much.It kept you on the edge of your seat most of the time, and the ending took me completely by surprise."
4,Easy read,It was a very easy read and read it in two days. It's m first book by this authour. I am sure I'll read others. It's not the best mystery I have ever read but it was enjoyable. I'd recommend it.
3,Enjoyable but not incredible,"After reading many reviews on both the author and the book, I was very excited to read The Killing Game. This was my first book by the author and I had high expectations. The book is very well written and it keeps you interested throughout the entire novel. Her characters are likeable and the dialogue flows smoothly. The only knock I have against this book is it was never shocking. The end of the book was a let down only from the standpoint that I was never completely surprised. I still recommend reading this book, however, and look forward to more novels by the author."
5,Very Good Read,"This was my first Johansen book. There were more things I liked about it than disliked. However, you can tell it was written by a romance author. If the romance and tug-of-war between the lead character and her boyfriends was edited out you would have an even better story. At first, it wasn't such a bother, but after a few chapters it becomes more and more a part of the story and bogs things down. One finds oneself skimming over the romantic/dramatic soppy parts hoping to find more mystery.Yet, I still enjoyed it. Stayed up all night to finish it. The characters were fun, beleivable, and a few were endearing. I enjoyed the ghost scenes with Bonnie because they were direct, to the point, and not too long. They were emotional, yet didn't seem silly like the romance parts.And, of course, my favorite character was the dog Monty. I would like to read more about Eve and her mystery solving career without the romance."
2,"Very disappointed, The Face of Deception was much better","Joe is portrayed as an unbelievable chauvanist, who says words like ""adjust"", and finishes Eve's sentences for her. Eve is portrayed as a real dummy who puts up with him. Both of them were portrayed as too gooey - Oh Joe, Oh Eve - enough already."
1,Pure cheese,"I found the story contrived, the characters unbelievable and the entire book a waste of time. Unlike the better practioners of this forumla (ie Patricia Cornwell), Iris Johansen did nothing to make me like or respect her characters. I won't be going back to Eve Duncan and crew for a second chance."
2,A good (not great) mystery ruined by a love story,"This book was probably one of the most annoying books I have read in a long time. Although the plot was OK, I quickly tired of the fast paced dialogue between the heroine and the hero(s). It kept my attention, but barely. Every single detail fell conveniently into place and it seemed like all the problems of the characters' world were solved by an instant phone call. Very unbelieveable. It was a quick read, but that's because it was written like a play....all frivolous ""Hallmark"" dialogue, very little narration. The most annoying part of this book was that they kept referring to their cell phone as ""the digital"". Very annoying. Waste of 5 bucks."
1,"All angst, all the time","It's time for Eve to move on. Bonnie has been dead for 13 years - get over it! The fawning attention she receives at the hands of the male characters Quinn and Logan borders on nausea. Their concern for her health, eating habits, sleep quota, etc. consumes far too much of this ""been there, done that"" plot. There is nothing fresh or new and the main character Eve seems to be caught in an endless cycle of sameness. If you have read one of Johansen's books, it appears you have read them all."
4,It is a mistory about kids going to a servival camp.,"I like this book, because it keeps you in suspence. Something is always happaning at all times . The things that happen you con imagine that it could happen in real life. For example, Rabecca and Lee went looking around the island and someone shot an arrow at them and they ran back to camp. Melony was gone so they went to to Rabecca's tent and found a snake in it."
5,Made the trip to LA worthwhile,"I read this book on my plane trip to LA and was disapointed when the plane landed because I had only four pages left to read. When I did get to them I was pleasantly surprised. Ms. Johansen mixes the romance with the mystery well, not an easy task to do. I was expecting the romance part to ruin the mystery, but instead it actually contributes to the suspense. I loved it, just as I have all the ones before. Although, I wish we got a small taste of the next book as we did with this one at the end of Face of Deception."
5,Great sequel!,Loved it. Couldn't put it down. Don't start this one unless you intend to be up all night.
4,killing game,The Killing Game by Iris Johansen is the best book that she has written. This book is filled with many discoveries and a twistful ending. The characters are humorous and whitty. Iris's new book is very suspensful and it even has a romance story mixed into the plot. I gave this book four stars because it was full of action and kept my attention. I just couldn't put it down.
1,"Should be named ""Killing Time""","The story isn't so bad, but it's just another ""whodunnit"". I would have been more satisfied if it was a little more believable. The author using phrases like: ""turned on her heel"", ""digital phone"", and various other phrases continiously. It got annoying. The child's ghost was a little believable. If you have time to waste, nothing better to do, and can get this book for free...I suggest you read it. Otherwise, stick to Dean Koontz. His books are ""out there"", but at least he is an outstanding writer and really gets you involved in the story. Thanks."
2,"Weak beginning, weak plot","After reading Face of Deception I was really disappointed in The Killing Game. The plot was very weak. The fact that Joe came to get Eve to sculpt the childs skull was not good. Duh, Eve has a lab on the Island, bring her the skull. The romance part of this book was lacking also. I was very disappointed that the romance with Logan did not continue they had a good chemistry. Overall after reading the first book about Eve so much more could have been done with this one. It was very disappointing to say the least. In Face of Deception Eve was a strong women, in this she becomes weak."
2,Used paperback,"The ""used"" paperback had a moldy odor to it as if it had been in a damp basement for years. I would never purchase a ""used"" paperback again."
3,IRIS JOHANSON,"FOUND A SERIES SHE HAD WRITTEN. I THOUGHT I WOULD READ IN ORDER. I LIKE TO START AT THE BEGINNING. WELL; STUPID WOMAN, WEAK FLOW OF EVENTS, STUPID SITUATIONS"
3,"enjoyable, go jo quinn","i liked the book, not as good as other books by johansen, but worth reading. Johansens style is great - mixin the romance, tension, mystery...fun ride!"
5,"Awesome photos, moving story","Webster's Snow in the Kingdom is different than, and better than, the many Everest books that have come out in recent years. The stunning photography--literally hundreds of photos, many in color and many appropriately in black and white--come at a great price for Webster and are worthy of a more expensive coffee table book themselves. Add to that a fascinating, moving text that goes far beyond the usual ""we climbed, we almost died, we made it out"" adventure saga. Webster talks about excursions and experiences that made him the person who wanted to climb a new route up Everest. He humanizes Himalayan moutaineering in a way that not even Krakauer does. It's an exciting story, but it's much more than an adventure yarn. This is one of the best text-photo combination books on any subject I have seen."
5,A Good Read and A Great Mountaineering Story,"""Snow"" is an outstanding achievement----well written, beautifully illustrated, and meticulously edited. Ed made alive the routine of expeditions. This is a great read for the non-climber and essential for novice mountaineers and those stepping up to the expedition arena. I have not seen another book that so accurately describes the discipline and careful thought that goes into successful and safe climbing. Beyond the technical details, Ed reveals himself--- letting others know what motivates elite climbers to risk everything for climbing success. In an age when Americans seem to most value the things they own, it is refreshing to read of a life that most values experience. I am a better person for having learned Ed's struggles and successes.George B. AllenAuthor of ""Ultrasafe-A Guide to Safer Rock Climbing"""
5,brilliant and so consuming,"Not only does Ed Webster describe in detail the technical aspects of his mountaineering, but takes the reader into the emotional, social and physical challenges involved in world class climbing. A brilliant read that is so hard to put down in the wee hours of the night!"
2,Bummer,"I grew up with my dad playing this music. I remembered the music as a lot of trumpets and really fast tempo. This cd is a bit boring, and I definitely don't think it's his best work. Bummer"
2,camera work needs improvement,"The camera focuses an excessive amount on extreme close ups of the feet on the pedal or the hand reaching. This is often done to the exclusion of seeing Moira's tactile cueing, and how the body is stabilizing and mobilizing in a given exercise. The result can be both frustrating and boring."
2,Missing Chapters,"I ordered this book, but unfortunately held it for a future class. I discovered that it was an ""abridged"" version. I am missing the following chapters: 6, 8, 9, 10, and whatever might come after these. This has indeed downplayed a great rating and review."
4,Players' picks,"This is an interesting mix that was part of Alvin Lees' defining himself after TYA. Makes for quite an insight into the music that he thinks defines him. All really good choices for anyone who doesn't have a good collection of Alvin Lee (with and without) Ten Years After, or just wants a good CD to listen to."
3,"Good premise, bad ending","This is an enjoyable read, with an intruiging premise. I had high hopes for the book, especially given it's publishing history. Unfortunately, the ending was silly and the feminist overtones too much."
3,Overrated.,"Our book club just finished discussing this book. None of the 7 members thought much of it, though it was a fast and easy read. The best that can be said about it is that it made us think about other things, like our profligacy, and how much we would miss chocolate. It also made us reminisce about other books we'd read which handled the subject better (like Memoirs of a Survivor by Doris Lessing). Much of the story was gratuitous: the lesbian episode, the rape and subsequent pregnancy. There were a lot of loose ends and unfinished directions. The ending (not to give too much away) was unsubstantiated. Most irritating of all, perhaps, was the sucking up to current political/multicultural correctness. The white-girls-being-saved-by-Indian-lore is old hat. Just so you don't think we're a bunch of sour pusses... Our book club's most recent favorites: A Fine Balance (Mistry), and, also a first novel, Behind the Scenes at the Museum (Atkinson). -- The Vulcan Foundry Book Club"
3,This is a book for women.,"I like novels on this particular theme. Most of them are written by men, essentially for men. This was written by a woman, and clearly she intended it for a female audience. While the perspective is entirely different, the book deals in some places with what the Greeks called ""Women's mysteries."" Enough so that I was acutely uncomfortable with some parts of it.The book has a good plot, well developed characters, and is extremely interesting. I think most men would rather not read it, though.But then, I live on a mountain top in Appalachia, miles from other people. Maybe I'm out of touch."
1,one of the most boring books I've ever read,"As a voracious reader, I am not afraid to toss a book if it gets too dull to finish. After forcing myself to read half of this book, I began skimming it to find out when and why they finally go into the forest. I gave it one star because some of the writing was poetic, and because I like the idea of 'Nell' finally getting intelligent enough to look outside of herself for answers - finally! But I really couldn't like either girl enough to care what happened to them, and that's what makes a good story. This isn't."
2,Good book until the incest...,"Into the Forest by Jean Hegland had the potential to be a great book with an interesting plot. Two orphaned teenage sisters living on their own in the forest far from town after the collapse of society. The character development was up to par and the story was flowing smoothly, until the gratuitous incestuous sex scence between the two sisters. Ick. I put the book down in disgust. I returned to finish the book only to be disappointed with the conclusion, in which the girls burn down their house and go off to live in the forest like primitive peoples. I guess they still have each other...if the mood strikes them."
2,What was the point?,"I realize that this book meant to envoke thought and perhaps discussion of how much our society relies on material things, but I think it could have done so with better character development and without ruining the ideas the book presents by adding an unnecessary incest scene. I skimmed the book after that.What was the point?"
2,Unecessary scenes,"I enjoyed the prose and the flow of the book, but then well into the book, there is an entirely gratuitous lesbian sex scene between 2 sisters. It is so far into the book that it diminishes the whole of the work, and is pointless for the story line.Reviewers who say just ignore it just CHOOSE to ignore what they secretly dont mind reading. If it were racism or homophobia, they would not ignore the point!"
5,magical,"I picked this book up at the library when it first came out. It sounded like an interesting read so I checked it out. It was unforgetable. The story stuck with me for weeks after I finished reading it. The writer, Jean can really tell a wonderful story. It flows so smoothly that you cant put it down.Lots of reviewers didn't like the part of the story that involved sex between the sisters but I think they missed the point of it. The older sister gets raped so I think the sex between the sisters was to replace the violence of the act with something tender and nice. At least thats how I took it. It's a small part of a beautiful story so don't let that stop you from reading this book. You won't be sorry you did."
4,Some amazing parallels,"A short way into this engrossing novel, I was struck by the parallels with our lives today, even though this book was written in the mid 1990s. There's a faraway war ""to protect our freedoms"" that does not affect most aspects of everyday life but may be behind much of the collapse. There's a terrorist bombing, problems in currency markets, natural disasters including unimaginable floods of the Mississippi, huge government debt, and increasingly common shootings in US cities and towns.My spouse and I used to kid each other about what we'd need ""when the collapse comes."" This book tells more about it. A good read, though I agree that one scene could have been cut and the end is a bit extreme."
5,Explore Into The Forest,"This is a tale of being at the end of the road, isolated from the main stream of society, and then the breakdown of society as we know it.A story about two sisters who are home schooled and live in the redwood forest with their parents. The story takes these sisters through the loss of their mother, the society that we all know, the waiting to return to normal, and the efforts they make to survive.An increadible story that is hard to put down. I listened to this book on tape, and the narrator adds alot to the story through pauses in all the right places. I would recommend the audio version."
5,AWESOME book!!!,"Any reader who enjoys books about the outdoors, survival, and living off the land, in addition to stories about family bonds and learning to adapt, will love this book. It tells the story of two teenage sisters who are left to fend for themselves when the world suddenly changes abruptly, leaving them without power, phone lines, and oftentimes, food. It will make you really think about where our civilization may be headed. This is an extremely realistic story told touchingly by the younger sister's point of view in journal style (but it's not annoying like some journal style writing; it flows seamlessly and you won't find any dates here, because they have no idea what the old-fashioned dates are!). You really get to know the characters and feel for them. And you will really start reconsidering what you would do in this situation... because the time may come that we all must face something similar to this. Definitely recommended- you won't want to stop reading! :)"
5,Post Apocalyptic Superstar!,"I read this book many years ago. It has stayed on my top ten list ever since!It tells the story of two young sisters that are stuck in the forest and in the midst of a world that has melted down around them. They lose every thing, but manage to gain themselves in the process.I can't recommend this book highly enough!"
3,A Place to Hide,"In a post apocalyptic world, teenage sisters Nell and Eva find themselves living alone in their house in Northern California which is in second growth redwood forest in the book Into the Forest by Jean Hegland.The premise is interesting and the book reads at a jaunty pace, but disappoints in a few areas. As someone who has grown up in the country, I find it hard to believe that two girls could grow up in the forest and truly know so little about the flora and fauna around them. The other area was a scene that I consider icky and unnecessary.Overall, I would recommend the book for a quick and interesting read."
4,Hit home! Nice book...,"I have two daughters and the two sisters in this book really had my heart. I love apocalypse themes and this brought that theme together with a calmer, more personal story. I read it quickly and that is not typcial for me - very good. I guess I would have liked to know a bit more about what happened in the world around them but I also accepted that the story was more about them than an apocalypse - nice book."
4,Interesting novel,"This is a curious novel that focuses on two sisters in a world that is falling apart. Not much is said about the outside world, the focus is on a cabin in the woods and two sisters who eventually lose their dad (Mom has already been dead for a while) and they must fend for themselves. The outside world is unraveling, so services like food and medicine cannot be taken for granted, which make the sisters' lives difficult at times. They have to hunt and raise their own food and the like because stores are no longer an option. I do wish that we had a little more info on the outside world and why it has fallen apart. The ending is a bit open, so you can surmise for yourself what happened, but I do wish it had been a little more concrete."
5,The best book I've read this year!,"Follow the lives of Nell and Eva, two sisters forced to face life in an eerie and horrific apocalyptic world. The authors descriptive first person narrative brings all of the emotions to the surface which grips the reader through this entire book. She also creates a warm and seductive landscape painted with memories of what was and with the horrors of what is. Sure to please the palate with an 'end-of-the-world' flavor and satisfy the 'coming-of-age' appetite in us all!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"This book didn't do much for me; it was our book club selection recommended by a friend. The consensus of my group was that if you are a sister or have daughters you can relate to the story which in hindsight I agree. The story was flat and didn't answer many questions for me. It is an easy read but not a gripping one & to be honest, I found it kind of boring and really odd in some places. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,"Sensual, tactile, thought-provoking, relevant","Loved this book, have read it twice. Highly recommend it if you care about the woods, music, and preserving what's beautiful in the world. Wonderful descriptions."
5,extremely profound and thought provoking,"This book completely blew me away. I felt as if the aouthor has been in my head in sneaking a peek at my fantasies. I too, you see, have two daughters and am unschooling them as Eva and Nell have been. I can tell the aouthor has probably read some the same books I have and has many of the same gut feelings about life and the world as I have encountered. This book really shook me up and blew me away. I have told all my home/unschooling friends about this book and strongly recommended it. Our homeschool moms book club is reading it. It will be fun to see what all my ""hippie-wanna-be"" friends will think of it."
5,all time favorite,"This book goes on my list of all time favorites. It is beautifully written, has a unique interesting story and great characters. It really made me think about how we live, what we take for granted and how life might be different in the future. I highly recommend it."
5,Best Book I've Ever Read,"A haunting tale full of powerful emotion; a frightening look at a possible future we may be forced into one day. The author may have set out just to write a story, a good story. But she ended up doing so much more. She forces us to look at our world and realize how fragile it really is. Without grocery stores and fast food chains, how would we get food? Without the power companies, how would we stay warm and find light? Build a fire for warmth and light, hunt or grow food...it's easy to say, but could we really do it? Eva and Nell are faced with that reality, and we see ourselves in them. I would put this book in anyone's hands and command them to read it--and believe me, I have!"
2,Just didn't buy it,"I enjoyed the way this novel was written, the word choice and syntax were enjoyable. However, beyond being intrigued by the idea of it, Into the Forest falls short of being even a good read. The characters were not well developed and some things did not make sense. Incest? Please. It is the last thing anyone would want to do after being raped, even if it was helping them feel connect to the only family left.I pretty much skimmed it after that."
2,Didn't care for it,"...The prospect that the novel sets up is fascinating. The world as we know it has been destroyed-largely because of over consumption, and ecological and political problems. Nell and Eva must learn how to face this new world without all of the luxuries that we are used to and with many new dangers. However, too much of the story involves reminiscing about the past, rather than showing the reader this new world-the here and now. Also, while I don't mind an author having an agenda, the message in this novel was painfully overdone. ... It illustrated the point the author wanted to make...The characters were never really fleshed out to begin with (Eva in particular), and that was a problem in itself. ... The message of the novel is valid. We are a materialistic culture. ...I can only see a connection to the stereotypes of women as earth mothers, creators and nurturers. But these are simply stereotypes. In reality, women are as materialistic as men."
4,"Get a clue, this is a work of fantasy!","This is fantasy fiction, so comments like ""this book is too far-fetched"" are out of place. The novel made me reflect on how dependent we are of modern-day conveniences, and how a huge catastrophe would wipe out all of those things in given time. I enjoyed the sisters' resorcefulness, and felt truly bad at every disaster they encountered, but was very put off when they became intimate. One of the editorial reviews mentions that this book would appeal to teenagers...Hmmm...That's a bad call. I wouldn't want a 14yr old reading through the lesbian scenes...Anyhow, i think this book is very valuable in that it makes you think about what would happen if we had to do like our ancestors, live off the earth and make do with what mother nature provided. Until i read the book, i had never stopped to reflect on that. Had you?"
1,Painfully Bad,"A terrific premise, but very badly written. The author seems to have too little insight into her characters to give them distinctive voice beyond the broadest of cliches. Note in particular the narrator and the father as examples of the worst sort of TV-drama dialogue.The awkward, obvious social criticism is simplistic and cliched."
2,Beautiful language but otherwise a PC fairy tale,"Jean Hegland writes beautifully, which is all that kept me reading. Unfortunately, there is not much else to this book, a politically correct, thinly-veiled tribute to the ""noble savage"" and diatribe against the modern world. The story is farfetched: -All the calamities we worry about seem to happen at the same time: earthquakes, wars, nuclear power plant meltdowns, (was there a volcanic eruption somewhere too?). -Incest between the sisters -Burning down their home and fleeing into the forest for good. Not believable even as a post-apocalyptic tale."
1,Dreadful dreck,"I previously wrote a review for this book about a year ago, which for some reason was removed. Anyway, this book is just so ham handed with its stereotypes and its ""message"". Men bad, women good, earth good, natural herbs good, got it. I am fairly liberal politically, quite liberal on environmental issues, so the theme of the book sounded appealing, but the author has no sense of character development, or making charaters complex, real people; the male characters especially are so one-dimensional. And ""that scene"" with the sisters is repugnant, not to mention completely superfluous. Skip it."
2,Just a bad book,"This story has, by far, been one of the worst I've read in the past 2 years. Good plot, bad everything else."
3,falls flat,I was disappointed how the author ended this narrative. All of the sudden it was like she just gave up on the story. Did not make sense to me
2,"Knock, knock. Is anyone home?","Okay, I have to admit. It's hard to put this book down. Two teenage girls living in the forest, 3 years of firewood, stores of food, a gun and rapidly devolving way of life. BUT, there are serious gaps in logic here. Not to give too much away but would anyone question moving your family miles from the nearest town in second growth forest but yet know nothing about that forest or what it has to offer? Would there be no adaptations to the environment in which you live? Would such a family really be so reliant on electricity and modern conveniences? Still, there are things that get one to thinking about just how well one would survive if our modern way of life were to gradually devolve to say the turn of the 20th Century. How well would we be prepared for that? It's a short book and a fast read with an alluring topic. See what you think."
4,20th century Boston city planing,"Kennedy's research for this book was funded by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) for whom he also served as consulting historian. Hence, the strength of this book lies in its focus on city planning in the 20th century.The first 100 pages are devoted to the period from 1630-1900, but anybody with a special interest in that period is better off with Walter Muir Whitehill's ""Boston - A Topographical History"".Kennedy's writing about the 20th century also is more animated. Chapers follow administration (Fitzgerald, Curley, Collins, White & Flynn) and Kennedy gives a very readable account of the development of urban city planning in Boston and how it has been helped (and hindered) by politics. As is to be expected, the City Planning Board's and BRA's history and involvement in planning are treated in some detail."
3,Evocatively written but grindingly slow,"Smith is a talented writer who evocatively recreates the speech and culture of the holler people of Appalachia. The book suffers, however, from such a slow pace that it verges on the moribund through some of the narrative. In conveying the culture and landscape of Appalachia, Smith sometimes lets that overtake pace, plot and characterization leading not to just a slowing of the pace of the narrative but its grinding halt."
1,$15 Southern Sleeping Pill,"I was required to read this book for a college level Appalachain Appreciation class. This book was praised for its story telling abilities and discription of Appalachain culture. While it succeeded in telling a story of a cursed, inbred family, it failed to keep me awake long enough to finish in time for the deadline. The book entertains a host of narrators (maybe entertains isn't the right word) that losely follow a century of the Cantrell family. This book was the fifth book author Lee Smith wrote, following four massive failures. She continued the trend here dragging out a campfire tale for 300 pages. I reluctantly finished the book hopeing for a smashing ending to save myself from feeling like I had waisted my time. Unfortunatly that didn't happen. I don't want to spoil the ending for you, Lee Smith will though. Long story short, save your money."
4,A piece of Appalachia,"This is the only Lee Smith book I've read, so comparisons with other Smith books are impossible.The story traces the history of an Appalachian family from the late 19th century to the late-mid 20th century. It is told from various points of view, by various characters, at various times, resulting in a book which on the surface might seem ""downright Faulknerian."" However, Smith's main concern is the story and not the experience of reading it (which could, on some level, be said of Faulkner's literary goals), hence readings don't have to wrestle with the language. That being said, readers unfamiliar with the grammatical and lexical idiosyncracies of Appalachian English might sit scratching their heads at some of the characters' utterances, but the language is far from incomprehensible.""Oral History"" offers a view into a period and location that, until recent years, has remained fairly secluded. It's a pleasurable and rewarding read."
5,Extremely creative,"An extremely well-written, thoughtful novel with fascinating characters. The novel is very well-paced and hard to put down. The breadth of imagination is staggering. The ending could be described as unsatisfying, but I thought it was reasonable (especially if this is really going to be a 3-part series)."
4,Original Ideas,"This will be a short review of the book. As ususal Robert Reed does not disappoint. It's obvious that this book was not planned, i.e. that Marrow was to be a stand alone novel. Normally when an author decides to expand a story from one book to three, the writing seems weak, almost forced. The same cannot be said about this book. It's very entertaining with enough action to keep the reader interested from beginning to end. I've read almost all of Mr. Reed's books and consider myself a huge fan. What amazes me most is that he is able to describe scientfic terms/concepts almost as if it were poetry. The write is clean, crisp and flows. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed Marrow."
1,Outdated and Useless,"A lot of the percursors mentioned in this book, namely androstenedione, are no longer legally available in the U.S."
2,Some exclusive mixes...and little substance,"Peter Rauhofer's discs are always anticipated because he puts a handful of unreleased tracks on his mixes. This is the only reason I buy his discs, because he never gives us a mix that is true Peak Hour stuff-stuff you'd want to listen to again and again at home. Track times on this volume are:CD11. dance with me (8:36)2. If you want me (7:23)3. Sleepers (2:58)4. In this world (6:00)5. Bucci bag (4:59)6. Execute now (5:56)7. Appreciate me (7:52)8. The light (7:02)9. Shined on me (5:53)10. Chemical generation (5:10)11. unique (7:31)CD2:1. my empire (6:52)2. No way back (5:29)3. Walking on thin ice (8:07)4. Liberta (5:10)5. It's U (7:16)6. Young hearts run free (5:56)7. Pounding your soul (7:51)8. Elephants (5:11)9. I Try (7:23)10. Ethno Pole (2:27)11. This is my House (6:43)"
4,could have been a little more aggressive!,"This is a great cd, you will not be disappointed. On the other hand i expected it to be a little more aggressive. the best track on the whole cd is # 7 on the first cd ""trip to paradice"" this song will go on to be one of the best dance songs of the year. overall this cd is very good, you will enjoy it."
1,No no no,"This book has way to many ingredients that the average vegan would not have sitting around in the pantry. Perhaps a gourmet vegan might, so take this into account. I was excited to buy this book until I went through and marked the recipes I might cook. There were only 3 that sounded even remotely tasty and/or used basic ingredients. And these 3 recipes are very similar to what you can find in any other basic vegan cookbook. It's very frustrating to see a recipe and realize you would have to purchase nearly all of the supplies for that particular recipe. Rather than this book, I would recommend Vegan Planet, Vegan With a Vengeance, or How it all Vegan. These cookbooks are much easier to cook with without doing any major shopping first."
4,Entertaining film with hot actresses,"Brain Blockers is a film about a college professor who invents a new drug to ""cure mental illness"" but when he secretly experiments on his students with it, weird things start happening. His student assistants and a newspaper reporter are the ones who uncover the truth and try to stop him before several college students wind up dead.The film is more of a comedy than a horror film and is very entertaining. It also features several really attractive actresses (including Diora Baird)and is certainly worth checking out.The special features on the DVD include some deleted scenes, still galleries of the actresses and the hillarious ""Brain Blockers"" music video."
3,Early Dench still eclipses fellow actors.,This series is a must for all Judi Dench fans. This woman out-acts nearly everyone else oncsreen.An unusual 'almost biography' from one those infamous Mitford sisters. The early part with the girls as children is a little wooden but when they grow up the story really takes off so stick with it.It's a rather campy tale of the lives of the wealthy and titled in 1920's-30's England with Judy Dench as mum.
3,Not as I Expected........,"Love In A Cold Climate............I was disappointed to see what a small role Judy Dench played in this video. I enjoyed the movie, as it became interesting as it progressed. You must pay attention to the very first part of it to make sure you realize who all those children are and how they are related, because you watch them grow to adulthood. I have a hard time with British humor. I thought the father, Judy Dench's husband, was an absurd character. Not laughable or funny, just absurd. I believe he overplayed his character and his booming voice irritated me. Just my opinion. Would I buy this again? Yes. I adore Judy Dench."
1,oh my gosh this was awful,"One of my favorite novels, turned into a badly produced, badly written, badly cast pile of badness. If you're looking for something to keep you going while you wait for the next season of Downton Abbey, this is not it!"
3,Love in a Cold Climage,"Yes, most of the acting was excellent but for me that didn't justify a story about shallow, spoiled people (except for Frances/Fanny) doing shallow spoiled things. I also thought that Judi Dench's formidable talents were put to little use in this film. Very wasteful."
3,Love in a Cold Climate,"This movie is hard to understand. The children talk fast and have a British accent. I can usually adapt to accents easily, but this one caused us to turn off the movie and not finish watching it. We bought it because we love Judi Dench, but we disappointed."
1,Love is a cold climate,"Bought this movie account of Judy Dench being in it. If I had only known that this is NOT what I was looking for. It is unbearable to watch. I wish that I could return it, and get something else. I would NOT recommend this at all. Don't even think about it. Too bad there is not a rating lower than 1 star, because that is what I would have given it."
3,Manor House Backstage,"This is an excellent companion to the Manor House series on PBS. It combines the historical background of the Edwardian period, information about each of the participants in the project, recipes and instructions for making items seen in the series, and information that was not shown during the series, such as the story behind the pig's head (and whether Monsieur Dubiard was trying to gross out the Oliff-Coopers) and more about Guy's education (a surprise there!). I only wished it had information on the selection process and what happened after the series ended."
1,"Awful, and wrong","One of the worst books about gambling that I ever read (and I read many of them).First of all, it is too old: written in April 2001, that's more than two years ago, and that's not good for a world (the internet) that's changing daily.Even not considering this, it doesn't give any particular advice or original consideration. Every chapter is filled out with questions that are, in the end, not answered efficacely. And if you ever played at least one online casino, you'll know more that he does.But the worst part is that he gives wrong indications about Blackjack, Roulette, and Craps strategy. Anyone who knows the odds and basic strategy for these games can understand that. And the money management part is wrong, too.My suggestion, go find another good gambling book."
4,Classic Lou,"If you are looking for pure Lou Holtz motivation, you will not be disappointed. There are no ""silver bullets"" here, but the book will do a good job of reinforcing some great principles for creating a successful team or organization."
4,Enjoyable read,This is a easy read where many of Lou's points hit close to home. There are instances where he dwells on points too much but those are few and far between. His story-telling is excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed his advice. This is a motivation book that gets you in a positive frame of mind. I read a lot and this book ranks among the top if you need to create a positive environment about you.
5,I love this bbok,"I actually lost this book when my car was totaled a couple of years ago. That copy was dogged eared, hightlighted, and underlined in red throughout. I am so happy to get a new copy. It is so inspirational and I use quotes from it all the time. I love this book"
1,There is much better books out there for self improvement,My coach for high school basketball made everyone on the team read this book and honestly there was nothing in there you haven't heard or that isn't new. Basically to sum it up do your best and be ethical is all lou says. He in every chapter tells pretty boring stories of Notre Dame which might only be somewhat interesting if your a huge Fighting Irish fan. Overall this book feels like he reminds you of stuff you should already know is right.
3,Winning Every Day.,"I never received the book. Some how it got lost or went else where, I don't know. I purchased the book thru ""THE BOOK GROVE"". We e-mailed back and forth after not seeing the item for days after the approximate arrival date. To make a long story short, they refunded my money. It was just one of those unfortunate issues that happen. If I have the chance to purchase a book thru the ""Book Grove "" again in the future, I will."
2,The other reviewers are correct- duplicates abound!,"I actually ordered the entire Cheezy Trailers library from Netflix recently. Nearly every disc (with the exclusion of Cheezy Exploitation) has duplicate trailers on them...and some of the discs (including Horror Vol. 1 & 2, Scifi 1 and Fantasy) have duplicates of the same movie trailer on the same disc. Did these folks even watch what they were adding to their product?While many of the trailers decent quality you just can't overlook the numerous dubbed from video trailers (complete with authentic scan lines and squiggles and sometimes static from crash edits).On a positive note, you do get some interesting drive-in intermission reels on each disc which add to the variety (but once again, beware of duplicates).I work in the horror business and love wonderful old trailers, but I would have to warn against spending your money on these discs...you're better off renting them if you can."
1,CD does not work with current Mac operating system.,The CD requires Mac classic mode which is completely outdated. It will not work with any current Mac OS X operating system.
2,Bleach Memories of Nobody,This Movie Is Worth About 1 or 2 watches i watch a lot of anime the show is pretty good but this movie is 87 mins long maybe 10mins of good action thorught the whole movie save ur money better of buyin inuyasha movies or dragonballz movies rip off folks
1,I have not received this item,I have not received this book yet and am having trouble navigating the help menu
2,WORDY!,"I thought this book went on too long, rambled through two continents, and was UNBELIEVEABLE at the end. This certainly won't be on my Christmas list to give anyone."
2,There's a lot better stuff out there...,"Reading some of the positive reviews for this novel, I am a little surprised. Along with descriptions that often seem forced and unnecessary, the dialogue is clunky and sappy - read the first scene b/w Patrick and Julia for a good idea of what it's like. There are MANY better WWI novels out there. A few suggestions would be Helprin's book (mentioned by other reviewers), All Quiet on the Western Front, or Sebastian Japrisot's ""A Very Long Engagement"" (even in translation it's much more eloquent). I read probably seventy-five novels a year and I would say this is in my bottom five for the last twelve months."
1,Need a cure for insomnia???,"This was one of the WORST books I have ever picked up. I got to about page 80 while at school one day I and I felt compelled to just leave it in the garbage. I love books and am ashamed that I even bought it. The ""hero"" is Patrick Delaney, a man dying from cancer- but I think it was more painful for me than it was for him. This is vague, unemotional, and the characters are paper thin. You don't care about anybody in the story, you can form no emotional attachment or care whether he loses or finds Julia. The war scenes were graphic and admittedly well written but there was no good story around it so what is the point? Hull should just write non fiction history books. This was truly awful; what more can I say? I wish there was an option where I could give this book -10 stars."
3,Unbelievably wonderful until Epilogue,"I found this book absolutely spellbinding for the most part. Actually I was loving the history, the time changes, the philosphy.....some really thought provoking passages that you want to go back and read again and again. Then came the the last few pages and the Epilogue. At the risk of ruining the whole book for future readers, I won't disclose what was written there but I wish I had stopped before reading those pages. The event described there taking place is unlikely if not completely unbelievable to say the least. I will try to just remember the first 370 or so pages. Those pages and that story .....unforgettable."
5,A pleasant surprise!,"When on vacation at Glacier National Park, I ran out of reading materials and picked up a copy of this book, expecting it to provide some pleasant times sitting by the fireplace at the lodge. From the very beginning, I found it captivating. The first chapter hooks you and the rest of the book reels you in. It uses a clever series of flashbacks, moving from the reflections of an elderly man living in a nursing home to the experiences of trench warfare in WWI to a remembrance ceremony ten years after the war. As I read the book, I found it causing me to do serious reflection about my own life and our purpose on the planet.I am an avid reader and would count this among the half-dozen or so best books I've read in 53 years."
5,"A bridge to the past, the present and a good man's soul","This poignant first person story is told thru the pages of an old man's diary as he approaches death in a nursing home and relives a life filled with love, tragedy and ultimately happiness. The book will make you smile, and cry. It will be with you long after you put it down. Don't put this book down! Send it to a special friend that loves to read. Someone who will appreciate being transported to Paris in the spring with love and to Verdun in the trenches during the first World War. Someone who embraces life!"
5,A Wonder of a Book,"""Losing Julia"" is a gem. An exquisite piece that gently takes the reader by the hand, down the road of memory, of ageing, and of love. Read this book - it will warm your heart, make you weep, and give you a precious understanding of what it's like to grow old. The customer reviews that compare ""Losing Julia"" to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and other WWI classics are missing the point - and comparisons are odious at best."
5,Great Read.,"Hull's ""Losing Julia"" is a powerful story of the life of a survivor of World War I (the war to end all wars). I have never read such devestating discriptions of war, love or old age. Yet it is first and foremost a beautifully written bittersweet romance. I cannot recommend it enough."
5,diamond in the rough,"I think probably most people approach this book, as I did, as just another mindless Harlequin style romance novel.Nothing could be further from the truth. Hull has constructed an insightful story, and it is one which most will find, contains a great many shared experiences. I can safely compare it to All Quiet On The Western Front, not only in its WWI setting, but in its exploration of character interaction.I would hope that Hull will submit a screen play to the film industry for translation to the silver screen."
4,This book's got all the Big Ones,"Love, war, the ages of man. Boy, no wonder this book is so engrossing. It deals with the biggies. It truly is a book that you are sorry to see you're coming to the end. The author uses the flashback technique so skillfully that you more or less feel you're in there in the protagonist's mind -- you can share his joy, feel his pain.Another novel I read recently which had this same effect on me, of making me feel I was right there in the mind of the main character was Asher Brauner's book ""Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf""."
4,"An interesting story overall, but...","I found myself not really liking the character of Julia very much and hence found the love affair aspect a bit overdone. It took me some time to get into this book - I've been picking it up and putting it down since March and only just ended up finishing it last week. It didn't really grab me as I thought it might based on reviews. However, I found the writing strong and will definately seek out other work of the same author in the future."
2,A Negative Voice in a Sea of Adoration,"It's a strange experience to read this book and then read the reviews to date on Amazon.com. Strange because I find myself agreeing with most of the comments written by others. There is no question in my mind that Hull is a fine novelist with a strong command of character and plot development. I was also strongly affected by the story. But did I like the book? No. It is unrelenting in its agonizing. It is painfully devastating and disturbing, page after page. The author is merciless in pushing the reader into the twin horrors of WWI trenches and modern-day nursing homes. This was clearly the author's intent and he does it very, very well. And that's obviously a measure of his success, as the other reviewers note. But it's as if Hull was afraid that taking a break to explore something positive in Patrick's life would somehow delute his message. Just a note to prospective readers...be prepared."
4,Blood and Guts and Romance! What more can you ask for?,"Told in Flashback, a WW1 vet tells the story of the friend he lost on the front and the woman that changed his life. A beautifully crafted story with nice historical perspective mixed in. This book rekindled my intrests in WW1. I highly recommend it, and the audio version has an excellent reader!"
1,Peaches,"The book had know feeling, you did not know what any one looked like, they were characters with out faces. Now lets take Peaches, boyfriend to me he was just a person with a name who was flying from one state the another, did not say if was tall or short, light or dark, long or short hair. Was he bulit? The love sence's there were now. The only character you knew about, was the dead friend. There wasn't enough imformation or background to know who they were, or where they came from. The female P.I's, is a good idear, but not well written."
2,Warning - Not Divine Offices!,"I pray the prime, sext and compline almost every day.So in great expectation I played the CD and immediately I got all confused.Then it just got worse and worse.This is not a recording of the Vesper and Compline of the Divine Office.This is a recording of the Post-Conciliar Liturgy of the Hours.The monks of Solesmes do chant beautifully, but the material is flawed.The Latin of the Liturgy of the Hours is awful.It's like chanting the Tax Code.Secondly, the sound quality of the recording is substandard.It sounds as if they recorded it in a fishbowl."
4,A Great DVD finally released!,"If you like Bill Hicks' twisted, outspoken, and in your face comedy, then get this right now. If you haven't heard of him, go to his website and check out some clips. first.""One of the few people who may be mentioned as being worthy of inclusion with Lenny Bruce in any list of unflinching and painfully honest political philosophers.""from http://www.billhicks.com/"
4,Being an evil genius is a good thing.,"Bill Hicks was/is one of the masters of stand-up comedy. He was fearless in his subject matter, and pointed in his delivery. Not for the faint of heart, or the stuffed of shirt. Bill Hicks will make you question everything, inspire brutal honesty, grow a healthy skepticism about your fellow man, and most importantly make you laugh. ""Bill Hicks Live"" is a rich journey exploring the dark, twisted landscape of this man's amazing talent."
5,Bill HIcks - one of the funniest adult commedians,I'm only sorry he isn't still around and touring. I'd like to hear what he'd have to say about these times.
2,Funny - but repititious,"While DVD is lengthy, the material from show to show is the same. Of the 3 hours, only about and hour of it is different material, but atleast that hour is pretty funny."
2,Eh,"When I was an angry 19 year-old, I thought Bill Hicks was a god. Now, being 24 I realized that I was just the same type of sheep that Bill hicks said was destroying the country, IE a person who listened to every opinion except his own. Bill Hicks is a pretentious d-bag. All his ""political"" rants amounts to nothing more than idealistic tripe, ""capitalism=bad"" is all the depth you get from a bill hicks ""skit"". He's not a prophet, he's just some asshat with no credibility or following who moved back into his parents house right before he died. I wouldn't criticize, if Hicks wouldn't have spent 90% of his adult life denouncing/rebelling against said parents. His legacy is over inflated because he died young. He's the Kurd(t) Cobain of stand up comics. Talent that was never realized, but is constantly speculated/exaggerated upon."
2,Overrated,"It is amazing how a bloke this mediocre can attract so many followers. Is this a case of the emperor's clothing?Let's examine his comedy (for want of a better description of what he actually does). Firstly,he tended to repeat the same jokes in different shows. Did he lack the innovation and creativity to come up with new material?Secondly, and more importantly, his jokes aren't funny at all. He liked to be shockingly crude for the sake of it. Cussing can add poignancy to jokes when used cleverly, especially in scolding skits, but this bloke was totally incapable of being profane and funny at the same time.Hicks had revelatory insight into American politics. His take on religion was interesting even though I did not always agree with it. his ideas were inspirational, thought-provoking and deep, but never amusing.Don't waste your money on the Hicks lectures- cos that is what this dvd is about."
5,Bill is great.,"Both hilarious and insightful, Hicks always delivers, even when you aren't prepared for it. Never has there been a comedian with such poise in his analytical method, with which he assaults everything from fundamentalism to modern musicians. Great buy for a fair price."
5,The Legend Lives,"On ebay, nobody sells more comprehensive collections than Bill Hicks.This is higher quality production than duped tapes on ebay.Buy this DVD now, please.check outwhatwouldbillhickssayDOT comfor a writing contest and see how people are keeping Bill's spirit alive"
1,"um...well...yeah, uh huh...okay...","well...I tell you what, I know samoan music and during my ""review""...the samples played were latin music. I don't remember the urge in breaking into a ""Flamenco"" when I hear my all time favorite ""Manu O Le Vaveao""..."
1,samoan...what????,ok...listening to the samples of this album..well I didnt hear one samoan word in there...made you want to cha-cha than siva. I dont know there is a mix up because that was not samoan anything....
1,WARNING - NO MAC BLUETOOTH SUPPORT,"I just bought this printer for my office and am sad to report that contrary to the product information provided on this page, this printer's bluetooth capabilities DO NOT SUPPORT MACINTOSH/APPLE OSX. I'm upset to say the least, as I have a powerbook and bluetooth was the reason I bought this printer."
4,It works.,"This is not the greatest printer ever, but it will do for simple printing needs. Works fine with OS X and updated bluetooth firmware. No 5 out of 5 because the printing sometimes messes up when printing with bluetooth, and is pretty slow with BT. Like I said, ""It works."""
1,pheew!,"Cheezy filming. Horrible music. Acting even worse. If this was supposed to be erotica for women, it was still shot from a man's point of view. Not very good at all."
3,"good protection, hard to get on",I like the set. I wish it had elbow pads too. The only downside is the wristguards are difficult to get on a toddler. They should be made with one side open so that one might lay their hand in it and then close shut with the velcro fastner. Good quality and works well.
5,Well Done.,"I liked the authors' treatment of the subject, and his plausible explaination for how Gunpowder evolved as a resource, as well as the impetus for modern warfare. He brings up quite a few points which make for intersting reading. Definitely one of the better books I read in 2004."
1,Schaum's Outline for Applied Physics,This book did not help me out. I am in general physics 1. I am so lost in physics right now and when I bought Schaum's outline it confused me even more! It was a waste of money. It may look helpful but it's not.
5,Great in home gym,"The Total Trainer DLX 3 is a great in home gym and arrived very quickly from Bayou Fitness. The Trainer came 90% assembled and nothing was broken or missing from the parts list. I use the Total Trainer every other day and it gives me an awesome workout. This machine give me a great cardio workout on the low settings(I use setting 2-3 to warm-up.) and a muscle twitching, sweat-dripping workout on the high settings(I use setting 11 for legs and setting 6 for upper body). The trainer folds up to a compact size when not in use, I have it in my bedroom. I'm glad I bought it!"
5,Great Trainer,"I haven't exercised regularly in quite a while and was somewhat concerned about buying this exercise equipment. But I have to admit it's one of the best buys I've made this year. Very easy to attach accessories, you can complete movements very easily without constantly having to get on and get off. I can easily tell that my muscles are getting a great workout."
3,Not quite classic Dan Hicks,"This CD/DVD combo sound promising:Dan Hicks' 60th birthday, with all of his musical cohorts from over the ages and some of his greatest songs. The problem is that there are too many people on stage and too little rehearsal (although it is pretty good for a single rehearsal). While there are great solo spots (notably from Sid Paige), this album is not as tight as what we have come to expect from Hicks. Dan also sounds a little off, and not quite as funny as usual. I would highly recommend another Hick live album, Alive and Lickin', as a five star alternative to this, if you're looking for a tight band, great music and good humor from a true American music original."
1,Shipping from company sucks!!,I paid 11 extra dollars for a 7.95 set of these sticks and its been 6 days and no delivery yet.The promised dates were between 1-3 days. If I hade the chance I'd give whomever is in charge of shipping a nice kick or dozen in the rear.
3,Before and After : Living and Eating Well After Weight Loss Surgery,This was not my favorite book. However if you are having gastic by-pass surgery this may be a book you want to consider. It is mostly an account of an actual by-pass patients day by day and week by week experiences.
2,Not What I Expected!!,"This book doesn't have much information that I needed for my weight loss surgery. Most of the recipes seem to be for post ops who are over a year out and many that just sound too much bother to make with too many ""off the wall"" ingredients (that I would have to go out and shop for or order online). I need meals that are fast and easy to prepare, not a recipe for a Bloody Mary that contains 12 ingredients."
1,very disappointing,"Very Disappointing. Some love it, some hate it. Only too late did I find out those who love itJust didn't know any better. Mostly recipes that call for items sold by the author from her website. Not for those looking for truth about life after WLS and how to adjust food intake. It promotes living on protein drink supplements sold by the author. Got a used copy and it wasn't worth the money."
1,What a waste of time and money,"I'm sorry, but this book was more of a travelogue of Susan's adventures jaunting around the globe after her surgery. Please spare me the details of how exquisite the gardens were, or how lovely a time you all had - just give us relavant facts about the experience of Weight Loss Surgery. While there was useful information in the book, you had to wade through her sappy stories and useless details. Sorry, but I wish I had spent my time and money elsewhere."
5,The Surgical Weight Loss Queen without a doubt,"I had weight loss surgery 6 months ago, and one person who can make your trip a very pleasant one is Susan Maria Leach, not only is her book the best, but, this lady had dedicated her life with a vengance to helping WLS patients. The book is great, and please, please, if you have this surgery, Go to www.bariatriceating.com I will be a customer for life, and you will be too once you try it. Check out her site, she has a WLS store as well as the web site, and if that is not enough she has a blog and message board that is great 4stars! WLS is the only answer for thousands, but the battle has just started when you are approved for the surgery and have it. To live well and feel well, Susan Maria Leach is a Godsent for weight loss surgery patients. If you only buy a few books about WLS, this is definitely one you must have! Before you buy one thing, remember Bariatriceating.com A loyal fan forever!"
1,Not worth the money!,"This book was like an infomercial selling her vitamins. Wow if this is all it takes to make money, I'm going to write a book too and make millions. Nice try Susan Maria. As preachy as she is on OH and always slamming the wonderful Carnie Wilson, she really needs to follow her own advice and there is no way she weighs 135 Lbs. I met her and I can vouch for that. I just wish people who have had WLS can be honest about how much weight they are really losing and keeping off. I had WLS and I am smaller than she is and weigh 135 Lbs."
1,Copy cat,This author stole our name for our weight loss company then she put our name on her book--she lives in our neighborhood so I know she knew she was infringing on our name. I have no respect for her and her book sucks.
1,What a Waste - Not Waist,"I did not like this book what-so-ever. I didn't care for any of receipes because has it has already been stated, they are not user, family friendly for those with a lifestyle that includes cub scout meetings and baseball games. The entries regarding her financial lifestyle certainly didn't help either. If you want to read this book either pre or post op I would suggest borrowing a copy, not purchasing. However I will give the author a point for stressing the importance of protein."
4,Great if you live in Florida,"The author's relating her experience with weight loss surgery is very good, informative and easy to relate to if you have undergone the surgery. The recipes are interesting, but there is too much emphasis on cooking as if you lived in Florida. Still and all there is something for all tastes and while some of the recipes are a tad involved they are worth trying. While I'd love to make some of the recipes I live in a land locked state where fresh fish is not an option; but if you are willing to pay the price for fish flown in then by all means try a few."
4,Very Nice,"I can't say any other adjective for the book, other than it's nice. It seems sugar coated to me, because obviously she has suffered more than she leads on. OK, i see that the results are fantastic, but still, i just can't believe everything she says. But I hope that's exactly what she went through, because it's very motivating. (I think, because for those people who didn't lose as much weight, it can be pretty stressful) As for the recipes, I didn't try them yet, but other than that I think it's good resource. But not for the Gastric Banding! Only for Gastric Bypass. Though some suggestions may apply to both."
1,Waste of money,"This book is so annoying, I cannot believe it was even PUBLISHED. I agree with the previous reviewers- she comes off as better than thou, arrogant and a hypocrite. She writes about how her life is so amazing and charmed following her surgery, seriously, anyone with THAT kind of money would have such a ""charmed"" life. She talks about all these things she does and all the things she buys, while just appearing shallow. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time, and please don't pad her pocket with another dime, cause I don't want to read about it in her next book. Which I'm sure would contradict half of the things she ""recommends"" in this."
1,Before and After: Living and Eating Well After WLS,"I was more like a journal of her experience w/ wls in the ~1st 60pages... (perhaps if I read preop would of been more excited???) it is 1/2 recipes pages pp93-244 Q&A pp61-92 and should be a cookbook not WLS book (IMHO)...I guess with almost 2 yrs under my belt and being on 15 ossg-yahoo boards or more it didnt give meanything ""new""...Dont get me wrong it isnt bad it just didnt add to my research/knowledge! My 2 cents..(*I wish I had saved the $17!!!)"
2,Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was so excited that this book was coming out, hoping to get some new info. Well what I got was an OKAY cook book, that is it.If you can get a used copy or even have someone lend it to you then that is the way you should go. Do NOT spend the $24.00 on this book. To bad I can't get a refund!!!"
5,Thank you Susan,"I found this book to be the guiding light that I HAVE BEEN looking for!! I had the lap banding instead, but found so much help and advise from Susan's book. I can't wait to try the recipes she has graciously given us in the book. Thank you for being out there for us ""loosers"" Susan."
4,Before and After,"I enjoyed getting this book. I was really having a difficult time just two weeks post surgery and ""Before and After"" was helpful and hopeful for me. I would recommend this book for anyone who is preparing for gastric bypass or has had it done.It is a good aid however, I had lots more pain and distress than the author related to having."
3,Before and After: Living and Eating Well After Weight Loss Surgery,This book was disappointing because it was excerpt of the Authors diary and really not as informative as I thought it would be. I did enjoy checking out the recipes for possible future use. I thought it would be more indepth.
2,before and after,This book is helpful for a beginner in learning about weight loss surgery. Although the book was informational it was boring. There were helpful tip pages and nice recipes however. Do not stop with this book for more info on this surgery to make your decision.
4,"Good for Atkins dieters, too","My wife bought this to be prepared for bariatric surgery, but looking through it I think there's lots of applicability for my non-surgical Atkins-type diet, too. Most of the recipes are high protien and low carb; perfect. Looking forward to some of the holiday treats."
2,Before and After,"I am a new post op RNY Bypass patient and was thrilled to see something being written on the subject by someone who had actually something positive to say. I was to say the least disappointed that Ms Leach didn't follow most of the guidelines for eating post-op. Further she didn't suggest to others that you might not EVER be able to eat the way she was eating. Also Alcohol is a big NO NO which she talks about at length. There was some useful information, but on the whole the book lacked true content and was certainly not worth the price-Wait for a used copy or if it come out in paperback-Thats about how much the information that was useful was worth."
4,Anecdotal and Useful,The journal part of the book should prove informative to those contemplating WLS. The recipes are very good.
5,EXCELLENT RESOUCE!!!,"This is a nice, well-rounded book in terms of the gastric bypass experience. The best part, however is that she provides really great recipies and discusses their possible uses in different phases of recovery after post-op, and how to adapt them both to the patient and the patient's family. I haven't tried a recipie in this book yet that my family didn't love!"
1,Who eats at these places?,"I had gastric bypass surgery a month ago. I bought this book afterwards thinking it would give insight into the ongoing process. Instead I felt like I read a series of restaurant reviews. She continues obsessed with food, eating out, getting bites of desserts, instead of learning to direct her energies in other directions. I agree with other reviewers that her recipes are not made with easily available ingredients."
3,Yet another Hannibal review.,"By now there doesn't seem to be much left to say, but since I managed to ignore most reviews and read Hannibal years after it was released, others might as well.Hannibal would have been far more enjoyable as a standalone novel rather than a sequel to Silence of the Lambs. I find it impossible to ignore the changes of two main characters. There was *nothing* in Silence that suggested what would eventually happen to Starling. Even not considering that, Harris seemed to be more interested in shocking the reader not because it fit the story but just because he felt like it. One theory is that, after his initial refusal to do a sequel to Silence, Harris wrote something he figured would be unfilmable to spite those putting pressure on him. Hannibal is not all sludge though, as the prose was often captivating and I found the Florence section rather good, so I'd suggest to anyone who might pass over Hannibal to borrow it from the library and read that part alone."
3,False advertisement,"I got the book today (which was faster than I thought it would come) but I was expecting a new one, because that is what condition it said it was in, and I got a used one. The pages are all there and there are not any damages that I can see right now but as a bonus I got an Amtrack stub, a coat check ticket, and a different cover! Not cool. I am not going to send it back as of right now but don't advertise one thing, sell it, then send another. It's just bad buisness."
4,Doing the job,This is a item that rarely if ever gets put into use. It is there as a safety devise. I chose this one because of the Flint and walling name and quality.
4,The Quakers In America,Very informative but a bit dry and sometimes hard to follow. A real eye opener.
5,Crashingly wonderful,Bought this as part of a gift for the Hubs. He smashed the bujeezees out of it and loves every second of it. :) Success!
3,"Still Good, but glad it wasn't my first Spenser read!","Being a true fan of Robert Parker and his work I have to give this book a three on the scale. This book was the slowest moving that I have read so far. Hat's off to Spenser for staying loyal, (he always will) to Susan with the tempting, beautiful Clive sisters around....If this was my first Spenser mystery I may not have become hooked on them. It is my 9th and by far the most disappointing one yet. I miss Hawk and some of the action. This story seemed to move very slow. I am looking forward to the next story, hoping it will be ""back to normal"". What I mean by that is having the, ""Can't put this book down"" feeling."
3,"Good, not great","I always enjoy spending time with Spenser and Susan, so I enjoyed this adventure. However, it's not one of the series' best. I figured out the mystery long before the end, perhaps even before Spenser, and knowing who dunnit so early on took some of the fun out of it. And I missed Hawk. But most of all, I had a hard time with the Clive family. The sisters had such sad, empty lives, and the story took them nowhere towards a happy ending."
2,Disappointed!,"I was disappointed with this Spenser novel. I found Spenser to be more arrogant than usual. The plot took a couple unneccesary twists. ""Whodunit"" was the obvious character."
2,He's been better.,"Well it wasn't awful but Robert Parker has surely lost the need to write tight, well-crafted, believable novels. My thought on reading this was that he wanted to write off the expense of a trip to Georgia and so dashed off a book in that locale one lazy weekend. For readers new to the Parker mysteries, go back to the early Spenser books; they are far superior in terms of story, pace, and relationships. The newer books are witten in black and white; there are no grays or shadows in the characters or story."
3,Parker wilts in Dixie Heat,"Parker's latest installment in the Spenser series finds our hero south of the Mason-Dixon. Unfortunately for the reader, it is Parker and not Spenser who seems to wilt in the Georgia heat.For the most part, Hugger Mugger is filled with all of the ingredients that readers enjoy in a Spenser novel, i.e. action, interesting characters, and humor. As with other books by Parker, readers will find this easy to get into the story and a fast read. The ending however, seems poorly crafted and comes somewhat abruptly (with Stephen King-like suddeness!).One wonders whether Parker was tiring of writing this story or was perhaps distracted by his new Sunny Randall series. If you are new to Spenser, I would suggest Double Deuce or Pale Kings and Princes."
4,"How Many Times Can You Say ""I Loved It!""","A sniper is shooting horses at Three Fillies Stables. Spenser is hired. The mystery is good, Spenser is very funny and as usual, the dialogue is terrific. I'm waiting for a Parker I don't like so I have something to complain about."
4,VERSATILE PARKER,"This is another entertaining, suspenseful Spencer, which takes place in the horse-racing world of Georgia. I will miss Parker's 1-3 books per year with his main characters that readers have come to know on a personal basis. Spencer is his normal fit, deadly, wise-cracking self, who takes care of the bad guys, and of course, enjoys his sweet squeeze Susan the Shrink. Parker obviously does a lot of research about the main topics of his books. His descriptions of the humidity of the South is outstanding, and you canmost feel the sweat oozing out of your body, even though you're sitting in a comfy chair overlooking the ocean in cool Oregon. Also, few can write dynamic, fast-moving dialogue like Parker."
4,Spencer All Over Again,"Typical Spencer novel. It is so similar to all other Spencer novels that I almost thought I had read it before. Again we get to learn how tough Spencer is and yet how unprejudiced he is towards women (represented by Susan as usual) and all types of minorities.Yet again, I just love Spencer novels. I should probably be bored with them by now but I am not. Just a perfect reading for a lazy sunny Sunday, if you like Spencer that is."
3,The formula still works,"I like Robert B Parker's Spencer novels, I've read most of them and am always interested in picking up a new one. They are smart, clever and funny. I like the character of Spenser and the tone and style of the novels. Hugger Mugger fits snuggly into the formula for Spenser novels that Parker has developed over the year.Ok this isn't one of the all time great Spenser novels, but it still works. The plot may be a little contrived and I always miss Hawk's ascerbic comments, he's presence is sorely missed here. Parker creates the requisite number of oddball characters and suspects, and even though this novel feels formulatic, it's still an enjoyable way to spend the commute to work.This isn't supposed to be gritty realism, or a shocking page turner. What it amounts to is good entertainment value, with familiar characters we know and love. A nice way to loose yourself for a few hours in Spencers world."
3,usual Parker,"The plot is weak. The characters are uncompelling.There's not a lot of mystery or suspense.The description of the region in Georgia where most ofthe action occurs is undistinctive and uninformative.A dud, right? If so, why did I enjoy it so much?It's Parker. He could write a book about Spenserwatching paint dry, and I'd be riveted. He pace, hisdialog, his style -- one is completely drawn into thecharacter and the scene.True, sometimes it seems Parker's a bit tired --running on autopilot, perhaps stretched too thin byhis accelerated writing schedule of recent years.But Hugger Mugger's still a good read -- a chanceto once again indulge in the work of a master of hiscraft."
4,Giddy-up,"Hugger Mugger is a racehorse and a potentially valuable one at that. When someone starts shooting his stable mates and makes an attempt on him, his owners decide that it's time to bring in the big guns. Enter Spenser, imported from Boston down to Georgia to try to weave his magic.When he arrives, he realises that things don't add up. The horses that were shot aren't particularly valuable, no-one appears overly concerned that the shooter will strike again, and the family who hired him are, quite frankly, full of weirdos.Once again we are treated to a mystery that is investigated Spenser-style, which is to say, humorously, capably and never, ever dully. Ever quick with the snappy line, Spenser is always in control and although at times it seems that the investigation is going nowhere, you find that you're having so much fun you don't really mind."
3,An improvement from recent Parker novels,"Robert B Parker has been one of those authors whose books I look forward to reading on a wet afternoon. I was generally pleased with Hugger Mugger but Parker is getting into a rut. His characters are getting to be all the same: Hawk is replaced by a Southern sherrif like Spenser was made into a female in Family Honor, but the characters are identical. There is a tough homosexual character in both the last 2 novels, entirely interchangeable. The plotting of Hugger Mugger is better than most of his recent books, and I am looking forward to his next book, a Jesse Stone novel. Hopefully we will see some originality."
2,"Dialogue is ""off""","I'm a Spenser fan, but this is the worst I remember reading. Parker's dialogue is ""off"" or forced. Most of it isn't funny but is trite. There's not much to the book, and I haven't been entertained."
2,"Spenser, we hardly knew ya ...","RBP's best works (with Spenser of course) take the world as it exists, poke fun at the pretension found there, and provide surprising Spenserian solutions to crimes, situations, etc. that are based on a view of justice that is wise, pragmatic and morally pure. In HM however (and some of Parker's other more recent efforts) the emphasis is on sexual situations, PC, and recycled 'cute' repartee. Spenser himself is more pretentious than real and the reader hopes that his main squeeze (Susan Silverman, a PhD Harvard shrink who is vanity personified) will float down the drain as she sits in the sink putting on her makeup.What's wrong here? The plot is ludicrous, Spenser is sleep-walking, Hawk is in Paris, Tedy (who appears as a Spenser sidekick in at least one other RBP effort) is a PC cardboard character, and Susan is too much with us. There is little action and no suspense, and the conclusion is unsatisfying by almost any measure."
3,Nothing New.....,"I have read every Spencer book that Robert Parker has written, and I am beginning to think that he has hit the proverbial wall. While early (and even middle)Spencer books are terrific, the last three books have left me severely wanting more. Dont get me wrong they remain very well written but the plots and story lines are getting ever more formula. I will keep reading them as they come, because Parker writes terrific characters. I just hope he can find new and exciting things for them to do!"
2,"Comedy and light drama, not mystery","I've now tried to read several of Parker's ""Spenser"" novels and have to admit they are lost on me. The mysteries are trivial, and the characters one-dimensional. Plot development is meagre and sadly predictable. What makes them go along so quickly is the finger-snapping, fast-quipping humor of Spenser, Hawk, Susan and others, which makes me think Parker is writing something more like the TV show ""Friends"" than a proper Hammet, Christie or Conan Doyle mystery. I probably would recommend this to anyone who likes light reading to pass the time, but not to a diehard reader."
3,Dick Francis need have no fears....,"My disappointment in this Spenser book is probably my fault. Reading the jacket, I thought that hey, Parker is going to see what he can do with Spenser in a Dick Francis type story. I shoulda known better.The race horse element in this book is strictly peripheral to a rather tired and typical Spenser storyline. Even Spenser himself sounds like he's getting tired of the series. When he's let go early in the book, he actually says okay, goes home, takes a ho-hum case and is ready to forget all about the job he was first hired to do, until he's hired by another of those involved. When he goes back, those he wants to question refuse to talk to him, and be darned if he doesn't accept that. Hey, this isn't the Spenser we've known and loved!I'm not going to tell you not to read this book. If you're a Spenser addict like me, you'll read it anyway. However, this book convinced me that it's time for me to investigate his two new series."
3,Standard Spenser novel,"Someone is shooting horses at Three Fillies Stables in Lamarr, Georgia and Spenser is hired to find out who and why. But no clues are forthcoming and he stumbles around until the man who hired him, Walter Clive is found murdered. And then Spenser is taken off the case and sent back to Boston. But, never one to let a client down, even a dead one, Spenser goes back to unravel the who and the why of it with the help of gay bouncer Tedy Sapp.This is not one of the better Spenser novels, but even a mediocre Spenser is better than most of today's mystery fiction. The dialogue, as always, is razor sharp and Parker's supporting characters are as good as ever. Like most Spenser novels this is just plain fun to read. If you like Spenser you'll want to read this one. If you haven't read Spenser before I'd recommend starting with one of the earlier ones like ""The Judas Goat"" to get a real feel for the character."
3,Hugger Mugger,"The story moves right along, but the author needs some synonyms for ""said"". The overuse of this word is very annoying on the recorded version."
2,Hugger Mugger was an overall disappointment,"I've read nearly all of Parker's work and the last few spenser novels have left me feeling cheated. The plot is weak, the entire book is predictable, and it seems to have no final ending. Spenser's investigation is nearing conclusion and then the book just runs out of pages. Parker has done so much better in the past. Readers new to Parker would do better to start out with the Godwulf Manuscript or The Judas Goat."
5,Hugger Mugger,Spenser is back! The characters are crisp and memorable. The dialogue is refreshingly straightforward. The plot is well paced. More please...
2,falls way short,This latest book along with Hush Money are far from Parker'S BEST. I have read all his Spenser novels and these last 2 are not close to the fun of his previous work. Spenser without Hawk is a waste of time. Next time leave Susan behind and find Hawk in a hurry so some real sleuthing and action can take place!
2,Not bad...,"Having read almost all in the Spenser series, this latest installment is, of course, a must read. Very interesting plot that falls a little short due to 1) Lack of Hawk, 2) No gourmet wizardry, 3) Too many references to Coca-Cola, 4) Minimal fisticuffs. It also seemed to me that the Susan/Spenser relationship was sweetened a bit much by the pair literally crying over the phone about how much they missed one another (Spenser's away on the case). C'mon guys, you've been separated plenty of times before - it's not the end of the world!"
2,Robert Parker disappoints in his latest book,"I've always made it a point to buy the latest Spenser novel when it comes out but I should have waited and gotten this one from the library (Sorry Amazon). Parker has run out of steam on the Spencer series and this book confirms this. Tired dialogue, miserable plot turn this book into something to be remaindered quickly. Instead of just moving the story south Parker needs to change his characters and let them grow. Afterall people change and grow as they get older. Spenser hasn't changed since 1985. If your looking for a good book by Robert Parker check out his series with Jesse Parker."
3,This really needed work,I have read all the Spenser Novels and this has to be the worst one I have read. There was no plot and it was BORING. I finished the book but I was very dissappointed.
1,"when you can't do it well, do it again","Someone must say it. Spenser is cold toast. And it should not be a great surprise. It's nearly impossible (even Doyle's pen nodded) to sustain a series character beyond 10 -12 books, and Parker began to rehash plots that long ago. This book is notable only for the aspects recently become common: large type, small pages; interludes of romance with dear Susan; sub-plots with no relation to the main plot (here, the nanny and the wicked mother/lawyer); Spenser's smart-aleck dialogue, even with friends; and a thin, thin plot,whose resolution brings not a single surprise. Parker's other recent books without Spenser have had, despite the poverty of plot, at least the freshness of new character. Here, even Pearl the WonderDog gets scant attention--though maybe that's a good thing after all. The book is enough of a dog as it is"
2,Not a good effort.,"There has been a decline in the quality of the Spensernovels for several years, and this is probably the worst effort of all.Since I have never read a non-Spenser book by Robert Parker, I don'tknow if his powers as a writer are deserting him or if he has just lost interest in this character. I suspect the latter, as this novel reads like a middle draft of a book, rather than a final. The ending is abrupt and gives the impression that the author just gave up rather than that he finished the story. Parker at his best was a serviceable writer with a gift for wisecracking dialogue, and in Spenser and Hawk he had two excellent characters, and a series formula which worked very well. The best Spenser is comparable to the best John D. MacDonald, but a long way from the least of Raymond Chandler. Still, a lot of people enjoy the series, and we hope that Mr. Parker will give us a better effort next time. END"
2,SPENSER FANS DESERVE BETTER,"I've anticipated every Spenser novel for many years and am disappointed with the latest effort. The book ends abruptly and without the kind of result an early Spenser would have achieved. There are about 25 pages mid-book that are a completely different story than the main plot. On p. 273, Parker refers to ""Walter Clive"" as ""Walter Klein"" in an obvious editorial mistake/oversight. And in the age of jet travel, Spenser drives from Atlanta to Saratoga? The characters are getting to act and sound less and less realistic, a pity because Spenser is a great character. Maybe Parker is spending too much time dividing himself between Jesse Stone, Sunny Randall, and Spenser, all in a year's time. Spenser devotees will see this book as a letdown."
2,"Mugged, not Hugged","One of the thinnest plots ever involving Spenser. So sparse that in the middle Spenser goes back to Boston (from the south) and gets involved in a few chapters of do-gooding that has no relation to the main plot. No Hawk. All the good guys are either black or gay. The bad guys are white and rich. No suspense. Wide margins, large type and double spacing make this a perfect airplane book if you aren't flying too far. If going from coast to coast, bring a back up, because you'll polish this turkey off by the time you hit the Mississippi River."
1,Don't order these they unstick very easily,These tabs are extremely frustrating. They do not stay stuck in place and will constantly peel up and get caught on other pages.
1,Very loud and unable to perform,I purchased this product from some other local store but it did not perform as per the price. It looks good but the performance is nothing compared to its appearance. It makes a really really loud noise and I have to keep adding more water to make chutneys and salsa. Then it starts leaking at the base. Avoid at all cost.
2,Not Dishwasher Safe!,"I recently received this blender as a gift. I stuck the top glass portion and lid in the dishwasher before using it, and the small center of the lid melted up in the dishwasher. So my blender ""broke"" before I even got to use it. Otherwise, it was very affordable and seems stylish.Motor seems to work well, but who knows how long it'll hold up once I start to use it. I suppose you get what you pay for."
2,Worked well for a while,"I bought this blender about a year ago because it was on sale, and it worked well up until recently the liquid started leaking into the base. The problem is the seals that are on the blade assembly go bad, so I contacted Faberware for a replacement blade set and they very politely replied ""can't help you"". Are you kidding me? The motor in the base still works fantastic and it could be fixed with a $5 part that the manufacturer doesn't sell for some reason. I'm avoiding faberware from now on, I don't want to support a company that contributes needless electronic waste to landfills."
1,Blender and Farberware are both disasters,"Extraordinarily loud, and performance is unexceptional for the brief time it works, after which you can't replace the part that wears out (the blade/bearing assembly) or get any support from the corporate drones. My opinion is that buying from Farberware is like setting fire to money, and this blender is their way of saying consumers are just mud for us to slog through."
1,Don't buy it...,From the beginning the blender made a very loud noise. Eight months later it started leaking and the blades were very loose. Now 2 years later while taking the base off to clean the blades etc. the ball bearings fell out. I rarely used this blender and only for smoothies. Farberware will not sell the base assembly so I have to replace it. I will not buy a Farberware blender again.
2,"So good, yet so bad","I purchased this blender from a local store about a year ago. I use my blender daily. At first, it was great! Stylish, solid base, heavy glass jar. But like earlier reviews state, it has recently started to get so loud that my kids plug their ears and I have to leave the room to blend anything for more than a pulse. The base has started to unscrew on its own mid-blend, the burning metal smell is there, and as of yesterday a bunch of black junk scraped off and what appeared to be tiny metal balls were in the base when I took it off. Now the blade wont turn. I also noticed a high amount of liquid needs to be present to create the vortex. With as much noise as its making, this should be a heavy duty, solid product. Not so much. It was a nice year, but since I seem to not be the only one having these issues, I'll move onto something else for my daily blend."
1,Broke after sparatic use,Don't buy this blender! The seal quickly wears at the bottom it starts leaking and eventually comes apart completely!
1,DOA,"there was no damage to the box what so ever... yet the blender is a baby rattle, loads of broken pieces inside the body of the blender.. total junk..."
5,"bond, james bond","I don't even like the James Bond movies, but this game is awesome! It's soooo addictive, it will have you coming back over and over. And although most of it is shoot-em-up, there is strategy involved too. But it's really fun for anyone who likes this kind of video game, and I suggest you buy it because it will have you hooked right away."
5,The Best Video Game Ever.,Getting an N64 is worth it just to play Goldeneye. The three difficulty levels with different cheats available for completing levels within a certain time goal make sure the game has long playability.
5,My review is going to be nothing but good stuff about 007!,"I think 007 is good for kids about 11 and up because it has some content in it that is kind of bad. But it is still a good game in my view. It is fun to try to beat an opponent but just playing against the N64 is fun too. The good thing is that if you have a child 10 and under it doesn't have alot of visable blood and the ""bad guys"" are not like monsters but people so it won't really fighten them. If I had to recomend a game to someone I would say 007."
2,Why do people worship this game?,"Well, to be frank, ""GoldenEye 007"" is decent. It is an average first-person shooter with some challenge. (You need to beat missions at a certain amount of time to unlock a secret, for example, which was a good idea.) However, there are more cons here than pros. The graphics are mediocre, not detailed enough. There's no replay value (for the one-player missions). The Multiplayer Mode is so boring and dull, there are not enough stages, or the stage just isn't large enough. The weapons are good, even if they're not real. Lastly, the lack of good enemy AI disappoints me. The only real fun in this game is purposely failing a mission. What also makes this game worth playing are the sounds of the bullets and ricochets as they hit a wall. The music rates 8.2. The short cutscenes when you start and end a mission are so pointless. The lack of enemy soldiers screaming in pain as they're shot also disappoints me. I'm sorry, but I think people looked at this game so blindly."
2,"Multiplayer isnt bad, Single player totally blows","This game is supposed to be a spy infiltrating a bunch of places following a guy thats going to jam all the computers in London creating global chaos. Yeah right, more like Bond running around like Rambo gunning down Russians without a hit. I'll admit the multiplayer is good, they should have added more maps and better ones. The guns are real but where did they get these names! KF7-Soviet, D5K deusch, PP7, DD44 Dostovie ? They really are supposed to be (in order) Ak-47 or AK-74, MP5 , PPK and I have no clue what the last one is. In short the game is good for the first day or two, but then it goes downhill from there."
5,A Good Bond Game!,"This is a good shoot'em up game if yur that kind of guy! Cool weapons,cool characters,many challenges! This overall is a good game may not be the best but it's good! Good graphics for N64 and has fun to play multiplayer with modes such as The Man With the golden gun and You Only Live Twice! Over 20 missions of fun and excitement! If yur a big 007 fan this is one of the best games oyut thur in the 007 dynasty!"
5,Golden Eye 007 is so bad I couldn't put it down for 3 days.,The start is infuriating but the excitment builds until you have the hang of it all. You complete the fist levels and then you find that there are another 2 levels of difficulty ahead. Why do people write these programs to waste my time. Oh my son wants his Nintendo 64 back now so I will tackle the higher levels later. PS I am 40 and my son is 7. Dads are horrible aren't they.
4,an amazing and action gripping game,This is a really amazing game! with a few friends you can have a great laugh with non-stop action! It is a game for every-one even the single player game is fast and fun. I advise every-one to save up and get the game as soon as possible!
1,This stinks,Man this game is so bad. IF you dont agree right to me.I beat the game in one day. IT's graphics were horrible. The new 007 game is much better. This actually has good graphics.All I know is this game was too easy and had horrible graphics and all the other reviews are LYING!!!!!!!!!
4,COOL!,THIS IS AN OLD BUT VERY GOOD GAME. It is one of the best shooting games I played yet and is a lot like the movie. The weapons could improve though
5,The Roughest Nintendo 64 Game in the West,"I bought this game the week it came out, and I still play it all the time! This almost beats ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"" as the best Nintendo 64 game. ""Goldeneye 007"" is actually two classic games in one.The main game is extremely well made. It is also the hardest game I've ever played. Then there's the Multiplayer mode. This is a lot of fun, with many possibilities. I highly recommend ""Goldeneye 007""."
5,"This is a great game, who cares what others say.","You people who say this game is to easy and fun are probably those sissy people who do nothing in their lives except play video games and smoke pot all day. Then you get on here and whine about every little thing and wonder why the world isn't the way you want it. And you, the guy with the 13 your old kid, get a life kids used to play cowboys and Indians all the time 30+ years ago. So quit pushing your PC crap on other people.By the way this was a great game and still is."
5,The BEST GAME EVER,"I have to say when I first heard of this game i thought it wouldnt be as good as games like Doom. Then i played it at a friends and i got addicted. This summer i bought N64 and i bought it for GoldenEye. The missions are amazing and some like Aztec and Temple and very hard(sometimes even with cheats)Some of my friends are saying that this game boring but after playing multiplayer they love it again. That is the best part about, multiplayer because you can have fun battles with your friends using mines or shooting threw the windows of bunker with sniper. The only bad part about Goldeneye is that in multiplayer you cant play the computer. So far N64 has tried to make better games than Goldeneye like Mission Impossible which i have to say is terrible. N64 might come close with Perfect Dark but still Goldeneye will always be my favorite N64 and almost everybodies"
5,GREAT FUN FOR HOURS,THIS GAME IS SWEET. YOU CAN SPEND HOURS OF FUN SNIPING OFF YOUR FRIENDS OR PLAY A MISSION WHICH IS A COMBO OF SHOOT-EM-UP AND STRATEGY. A MUST BUY FOR ANY N64 FAN!!!!1
5,this rocks,"This game is so realistic and it is the coolest game ever.You go around killing guards and offecers and bosses like 006,xinia,general aroumoff and mutch more. You can pick up sweetwepons and items."
5,best gun game ever,this game is amazing and has good graphics. my favorite wepon is the rocket launcher
5,Did Anyone say fun?,Not too much that I can say that hasn't already been said...but this game is a must get that's for sure. I brought this game over to a friend's house and have competitions(that I always win) over and over again cause that game just has endless replay value and challenges for us. In fact another friend is coming over this week to challenge me...cracks his knuckles well I better get practicing and quit typing this review.
5,james bond is still at the top,"the perfect secret agent, daring, charming, and of course dangerous. now i know this game is old, and i'm still reviewing it, but it doesn't get boring. it was game of the year, '96 or '97 i belive, and it did deserve it. it is an instant classic. and it was kind of easy because if you watched the movie, you could probably beat it. but i liked the difficulty settings, agent, secret agent, and 00 agent, then there is the the hardest 007 agent, which took me a while to get. the cheats are also fun, especially the gold pp7. anyway, it still interests me after all these years, and if you don't have it, i say , go get it. you're missing out on a great game."
4,Great game.,"There were a few stickers on the cartridge, but it's alright because the game worked fine and it's such a fun game when you're on multiplayer mode."
5,good game,This was a Christmas gift for a friend. It arrived in time for Christmas. She says the game works great and she loves it. Thanks so much.
5,THE game that spawned the console shooter legacy,"My N64, it acts like a rock sitting right there under my tv. I bought a total of 8 count em 8 games on this pathetic system (I have what about 60 for my computer). But this game made me believe that a good shooter could be made on consoles (although very few of the ports from pc to consoles are, usually the original games for the consoles are good.)Of those 8 games I have, this one is worth about 10. The makers of this game are geniuses and have spread that on to other games like the timesplitters series (if there is any game that will make me buy a gamecube, besides metroid prime, it IS timesplitters 2. It is a master peace that will be lived on in my memories and it will remain stuck in my damn cartrage slot of my forgotten n64, or it would be forgotten, if not for this game"
4,ALMOST flawless,"Goldeneye 007 is a great game. It set the standard for N64 shooters although it DID NOT follow the storyline as well as it should have. The feeling of being James Bond infiltrating a facility in Russia gets to you wanting to play it constantly. Soon playing it constantly will get boring. There is no change in the way guards shoot, act, stand, no extra challenge except the fact that it unrealistically takes a whole round of ammo to kill a guard on a higher difficulty setting. Still, I reccomend this game to James Bond and shooter fans alike."
3,Nightmares....,"My brother brought this game home from a friends, and showed me how to play. After ten minutes, I was hooked. It's an addictive, imaginative game that comes to you at a great price in my opinion. However, I'm seventeen years old, and this game's VERY realistic killing gave me nightmares, and I've seen dozens of horror movies that didn't affect me this much. Maybe it was that I was actually shooting these people, not watching some unimaginative killer on tv doing it. I don't know, but I would reconsider giving this game to a child who is sensitive or too young to handle this. Thanks."
2,I love this game!,"I like all the leveles that you can choose from. The different guns,difficulties,and easy to open codes give you many different ways to play.So over-all Goldeneye 007 is the best game I own."
3,Overrated,"I don't see what the big deal is about this game. I am a big Rare fan (I have about 15 Rare games between my NES, SNES, and N64 libraries), and I'd have to say that this is not as good as many other games that they've made. There isn't much variety, and the framerate kinda sucks. If you like first person shooters, then you'll probably like this. However, if that kind of game gets boring to you after awhile, then this is not for you. I'd recommend Turok over this (the orignal Turok, I haven't played the other 2 yet)."
3,This game is ok.....and just ok,"When I first got this game it was really fun. About 1/2 way through, the missions started getting impossible. It's like it jumps from easy to hard in 1 mission. And you'll notice on the back of the box it says ""Smart enemies"". A bag of peanuts is smarter than those guys! They stand there forever and after a good 20 seconds they notice you and start firing. This game is fun the first time around but after that it just gets BORING. If you are concerned about how to spend your money, don't buy this game."
2,A Shot In The Dark,"This game is a poor, repeating open-the-door-shoot-someone-see-the-blood-splatter-all-over-the-place game. I don't understand why the bathroom doors open by themselves anyways. The poor aiming of the opponents gets on my nerves also."
5,One of the Best games EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game inspired me to get N64. This is the best shooter game ever and has great action. To this day i still play the game conatintly over and over. This game made N64 what it is today. The only bad thing about the game is the graphics but who cares it was an early game of N64. If you have N64 but don't have Goldeneye go out and buy it. It doesn't madder if you have all the new stuff like Gamecube or PS2 this is what made all that. Goldeneye is forever.
5,"My opinion: Seriosly, best game ever.","Wow. I'm 16. I LOVE this game. it's a couple years old, and my friends and I still play this game every week, tournaments with 3 Tv's and more at a time. Wow. great level of difficulties, easy to very hard... it'll challenge the best of players, and there's somethin for the youngins too. Get it, and get it now. Wow, whatta game."
4,One of the best fps ever! Tie for best on n64 w/Perfect Dark,"Goldeneye has to be one of the best multiplayer games ever. I still play this game against friends even though i have a ps2 now. The graphics are still ok to look at, even though i have seen far better on dc and ps2. It has excellant replay value and is very challenging to defeat on all difficulty settings. Pick this up if you want the best fps on n64."
5,One of the best first person shooters for the N64,This game has plenty of levels weapons and it has challenging gameplay with a pretty good multi-player (but i wish u could face computers in the multi-player) good graphics great play control and sound get this game if u don't already have Perfect Dark
5,da bomb,"this is the ultimate game, you can shoot guys with tons of different guns plus there's millions of codes i had trouble on the first level though i beat it in 2 days (note:i played for the longest time) i think this is the best game and it hasgreat graphics and sound"
5,Badass,"This game is just top notch! I don't know what else to say. It's pretty realistic alright. Ever take out a guys genitals with a sniper rifle and watch him cringe? This game will let you do it. My favorit part is taking out the guy on the toilet. It's just so real! I come home from classes everyday, and just take out my frustrations. The storyline is as close as possible to the movie, and the episodes just keep you on the edge of your seat. Can't wait for the next one...!"
5,best video game ever,"This vidoeo game is the best ever. Now all games are complicated, and it can take a week to just learn. Goldeneye took only a few minutes to learn how to play it well, but many many hours of multiplayer to master. It kept me and my friends busy for years. Four years after it came out it is still my favorite game . All of my friends and myself at college still play multiplayer almost everyday."
5,THIS IS THE BEST N64 GAME!,"This game may not have a lot of flashy features like sound, or simulant multiplayer, but who cares? I bought this game in 1998 and I still play it. I recommend it to anyone who likes first-person-shooters, or a James Bond fan."
5,awesome game,"I give this game two snaps up! (snap, snap) this is the best game nintendo has ever made. I recommend this game to everybody.I especially love the multi player mode."
5,This game is still good,"I know this game has been out on the market for a long time, and that other games such as Perfect Dark and The World Is Not Enough have come out and are newer, but I still think Goldeneye 007 is the best first person shooter ever. The best part is all the weapons and gadgets you get to use. There are also so many levels with so much to do. You can earn cheats and things that help you that make this game much more fun. The Multiplayer is just as good as the regular game. The only problem with it is that it doesn't have computer players in the multiplayer, so if you want to do a team battle, you have to get three or more people to play. Also, If someone isn't very good at the game, they're automaticaly going to lose. All in all, this is a really good game, and I hope it stays the best for a long time."
5,BEST GAME EVER,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER. THE MISSIONS ARE AWESOME. MULTYPLAYER IS AWESOME. THIS IS THE BEST GAME IF YOU HAVE 64 PLAY THIS GAME
5,"SHAKEN, NOT STIRRED","Hands-down the best N64 game. Goldeneye is very similar to the movie, like the Siberian dam mission, the satellite control facility, etc.. The graphics are the best I've seen for the N64, except for Zelda 64 (the first one). The auto-aim feature and 4-person multiplayer make the game perfect for the common area of a dorm room."
5,Only the best FPS on N64,"I had lost this game a long time ago in a move and was very happy to pop it into my N64 and relive the excitement of GoldenEye! The cartridge is in good condition and works flawlessly. Shipping was fast, and there were no problems overall.Thanks a bunch!"
4,A good time. Could be better.,I've played Doom and Quake. These games get really boring after awhile. GoldenEye is a freast look at the Doom consept. One guy trying to save the world. Although GoldenEye has made some improvements on this idea it still lacks in the sence that your running around with a gun by yourself. It takes forever to kill the enemy and takes even longer to kill yourself at times. The game requires planning and a bit of stragity. You can't kill everyone either just almost everyone. The cheat mode and multiplayer opions are a fun way to look at the game as well. So to sum it up as good as the game is and sounds is just partily correct. In truth it really is just a game witch does has realizum in only some respects.
5,the funnest game ever,"i played this game when i was about 15, and i'm now 24 and still love it to the death (literally). I have a blast shooting other things other than just people and watching bullet holes go into the items and how it looks so freaking real. I also have always loved how you can choose many different people in 2 player mode, such as 007 to scientist. The golden gun is the coolest because it only takes on shot to kill, but if you like a really smashing good time, you can always punch or cut your way out. A must have game for the 64 :-)"
1,This game is very childish!,"Here is my review- I won't restate the specific features of the game, which can be found in the editor's review. This is an extreamly childish game. There are many courses, all based off of about four different track styles. The music, and especially the sounds, are very corny. I can definately relate this game to my little brother's Reader Rabit Preschool on the computer. The graphics are okay, but used in a cartoon manner to create a very colorful, but unrealistic world. The physics of the game were planned poorly. The characters look like those Pokimon things. I would only buy this game if it was to be used by those under ten. Otherwise, it is too easy to beat and way to childish. (I am 14 and I beat the thing in all of the different difficulties in two hours. It is not very interesting after completed. You are not rewarded in any way with new tracks, characters, codes, or special features.)"
4,Just like new,"amazon.com is the way to go to buy used media.If you like to save money and don't mind a Waiting for delivery, it's the way to go.I bought this game for my son and he loved the extra instructions and literature that came with it."
5,Best Racer out There,"Wow. Mario Kart is the best racer. Here is my chart:Pros""1. Good tracks2. Good sound3. Very fun4. Great musicCons:1. Graphics are fair.This game is awsome. In every track, you get weapons such as shells, shrinking stuff, slippery bananas, and more. There are many multiplayer modes, such as Single Race, and Battle. In battle mode you are in an arena and you have to defeat your player by hitting him with weapons.The tracks are spectacular. They are the best, ranging from the easy 'Luigi's Raceway' to the hard 'Yoshi Valley' to the super hard 'Rainbow road'.You can pick characters such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, DK, Bowser, Toad, Yoshi, and more. Each character/racer has they're own characteristics.This game is a must-have for everyone. Buy it now, because it is worth all the money. Buy it! It is the best racing game EVER."
3,Its okay......,This game is pretty good. I found it more fun with a compatible N64 steering wheel. Although the steering wheel made it hard to control it gave you a more challenging race than with the standard N64 controller. If you like Mario and cute little racing games than this is the game for you. If you are into all out hardcore racing than I wouldnt recommed this game.
5,Mario Kart 64 By Nintendo,We appreciated that the delivery of this game was quick and on time. It's a great game for the kids and we are very happy to finally have it in our collection.
4,THE ALPHA-OMEGA GAMER,"Pretty fun (and funny) game. It is pretty easy on all the parts but time trial. I can make first on all of the tracks, but it would not be easy. O, about that 6 seconds wario best time thing, It was either a glitch or it happened because someone cheated"
4,it is a fun raceing game,I like this game for nitendo 64 it is fun to race i would buy this if i was you i have it is fun to play it when I got this game I thought i would not like this game but I love this game evenn though I dont play Nitend 64 that much.
4,Fun Game,"This game is really fun, but I honestly enjoyed Crash Team Racing for the PlayStation a lot more. One thing that annoys me about this game is that you can't look behind you. I pressed every button and I can't get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming. So nine out of ten times, I'm going to miss my target. How did Nintendo screw up this badly. And the racers are pre-rendered much like how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES. I was wondering why wasn't it computer generated like Super Mario 64? It's still a nice little game, a little pricey, but still nice to have in your N64 collection."
4,2nd Best racing game ive played ever,"The first time I ever played this game, was at my home. It was a rental game and I enjoyed it... ALOTTTTT!! .I would recomend this game to be a good birthday present for your child."
3,ok,"This game is ok. The Mario Grand Prix is fun, but there is no storyline whatsoever. Time trial is the part I hate most. You cannot beat the best time on any course. you can get 2nd on the star road, but you are lucky to get 5th on any others. this part is a programing error, but on wario raceway it has the best time set as 6 seconds!!!!!!!!! only get this game if you have multiple controllers, because there is V.S. and battle. v.s. is a race around a track, and battle is there you have a track to drive on (you're not racing) and you use items to knock your opponent's 3 balloons off the car.Only get this game if you have 2 or more controllers!!!"
3,i never won...lol,"I am speaking for all of those who never can never win in video games. My sister had bought Nintendo 64, and she had got this video game. Soon after, I was thinking maybe I should play one game just for fun. But this game drove me crazy! If I lost, i got crazy lol I kept on wanting to win! But of course, I never won lol. But my sister won, and she likes to play every now and then. I guess I am not the video game type, and I guess I'll never win lol But sometimes I try every once and a while. Even though I get fustrated, it's good to rent this game first. If you don't get fustrated (like i did) then you should definately buy it."
5,Kart racing rules!,"The best racing game i have ever played the multiplayer mode is great! You can battle or just race the other players in a versus mode. The Mario GP has 3 modes 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. When you race the object is to get the most points which is great!"
5,10 years later and still a blast!!,"Mario is a man that needs no introduction, and Mario Kart is just one of the off-shoot genres that helped the Italian plumber get where he is today.To this day, there are only 3 Mario Kart titles; the original Mario Kart for SNES, Mario Kart 64, and Mario Kart Double Dash (if you don't count the handheld and arcade versions). By far, the best one is the 64 iteration, followed second by the original. Double Dash for the Gamecube was absoutely terrible in terms of controls, graphics, and overall fun. The idea was good on paper but something just didn't translate well. Not the case for MK64. This is a great game, and I still enjoy it to this day. Me and my college buddies will sit around, have a few drinks, and have a go with this racing classic."
4,Awsome!,This game is so fun. I gave it 4 stars because there is'nt much 2 do. I think this is #1 graphics. Buy this game.
2,Nothing compared to the snes version,"I guess this game is ok if you take it by itself. But if you've ever played the snes version of mario kart you are going to be very, very disapointed. The tracks are slow and boring for the most part, theres very little difference between the characters, and the powerups are weak.The graphics are ok, but the suffer from very repeditive texturing, which can get pretty boring after a while. The only other good thing about this game is the 4 player capability, which makes its ok for parties etc.Still, you'll thank your self if you can get your hands on a copy of the gba or snes version instead."
1,A poor sequel to the classic original,"I'll probably be in a minority here when I say that the N64 version of Mario Kart represents a poor offering from Nintendo.Yes, the graphics are better, but when one benchmarks this game to the previous SNES version for sheer enjoyment and playability, you'll be disappointed. The new version has been made overly complicated with new track layouts, and this has adversely affected the flow of the game. The karts also don't seem to move as well in the previous version."
2,Gets boring if you have it a long time,Don't get this game because if you do and have it for a long time it gets really boring.But when you first get it its exciting but if you have it about like a year or so it really gets boring.But you should still get this game.
1,mario crash and burns,mario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret places[i think]. I tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i don't like racing games. The producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatified.
5,the best of the best,"when my brother first showed me this game back in...well i dont know it was a while ago (probably late 90's) but as i played it i was blown away by the graphics (nintendo probably took a page out of rare ware's book with the amazing 2d sprites) the level design is easy enough that even a two year old can pick up and play (and i would know) the controler design is simple. my only thing to say is bad is... there is nothing to unlockin every other mario kart i have playd (double dash,advanced,wii,ds) there was something to unlock and this one falls short. honestly i have played every mario kart in the series with the acception of snes but i have played some of those levels in mk-advaned (NOT the fighting game) and have to say if you could only get one mario kart...get this one"
4,Mario kart 64,The game is fun to play and its is better than Mario kart double dash the characters are limited unfortunaly.
4,Fun,"Mario Kart 64 is definitely a whole ton of fun. And when you're battling with friends, the fun is magnified by a bazillion. The character selection is good, and the race tracks are fun. The music is good, too. What I don't like, is that I can't just do a free race. I have to do a Grand Prix when I play by myself, or Time Trial. I would like to be able to pick any course I want in any order I want without having to do a bunch of others before getting to the specific ones I want. But otherwise, this game is great! -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,Mario kart 64,"This mario kart changed all mario karts in the future. This is the first mario kart that has mini games and computer generated graphics. I mean the 64 as u can tell the graphics have changed allot from the snes. This mario kart has many more features and great graphics. The sound is great also. If i had a choice of which mario kart to have for free if i did not have any of them it would be this one. I dont know why but for some reason this one is really fun. It has a great multiplayer, especially on mini games."
5,NEVER GETS OLD 9.5 OUT OF 10,"This was the first real game I ever played along with the first I ever owned. Despite the fact that I've grown out of many kids games and spend my time focused on M-rated games with a lot of violence or sexual themes, this is one of those games I most definitely have not grown out of. I love the tracks, the weapons, the characters(Yoshi's my favorite), and simplely how much fun this game still delivers to this very day. The replay value is endless, and multiplayer is still very engaging(It's always fun to humiliate your friends at this game). This game is what got me started on games and it will continue to be one of my most memorable games in my life as a gamer."
5,Fun for all ages!,"Ok, I am 26 years old. I rented this game so my girlfriend's 16 year old brother would have something to do over Thanksgiving when I visited. We ALL ended up playing this game! It is an incredible amount of fun, and it's reply value is incredibly high. I wish there was better music, but it would take away from the sound effects, which are definitely very good. This game is a must for all ages, particularly those who like to play games with other people. Note, if you want to play a 4 player match, you should have a pretty big TV."
5,$399.99? HUH?,OK now what person would pay $399.99 for a game?Is this game made of gold?Stay off the meds whoever put that price on it.
3,And they are off...,Mario cart is the clasic N64 racing game and is accually quite fun. Join Mario and 7 of his friends race around 16 different circuts from Rainbow Road to Toad's Highway. Only bad thing about this game is the graphics!!!RatingSound: 3/5 starsGraphics: 3/5 starsFun: 3/5 starsMultiplayer Fun: 5/5 starsOverall: 3/5 starsGreat game overall
2,Fun At First,"I absolutely loved the game until I beat it. It is VERY easy to win, and the battles arn't any fun! I only liked it for the first week or so! I helped that my review has helped you with you purchase!"
4,Welcome to MARIO kart?,"I hope my last review was helpful to you. Well Wario, Bowser and DK are heavey:Pros.1.They only times they sipn out is when they hit a banana.2.They bash most of the other players.Cons.1. It takes a long time to go up to max. speed.2.Their speed goes down when you go in grass or sand.Mario and Luigi are avrege.(NO PROS. OR CONS.)Toad, Yoshi and Peach are light.Pros.1.Their speed is a little bit higher than avrege and heaveys.2. 'Don't take long to go to Max. speed.Cons.1.They often get pushed alot2.They usualy slip alot.I hope this was helpful!"
4,This is a pretty good game,"I think this would make a great toy for all ages. First of all, it stays fun. If you are an expert at the game, you will still have a challenge, because the computer gives your opponents (computer operated) a little boost to catch up to you and keep you racing for first. This can also be disappointing, because if you aren't good, or you mess up while in the lead, they stick with that little boost and 'dust you' to put it simply. It keeps you on your toes, but sometimes it can be quite infuriating (like when you keep falling in water over and over and over). It is a great game."
5,Best racing game ever!,This game is super fun! The tracks are fun and the game is pretty easy. You should buy this game but not for that ridiculus price!
1,Save your money!!!!!!!!!!!,Don't get this chalk reel its junk! I owned two and they both broke in a week! The handle is too weak and snaps off of the plasic gears. Go spend your money on the(old) yellow and black model they seem to last twice as long and cost half of the price!Thanks Carpenter Greg J Wallander
1,don't buy this,"i wouldn't suggest purchasing this. it is a knockoff from 'paraclete press', an american publishing and distribution house. apparently an incompetent on their staff decided that only about half of the original CD (18 tracks versus 29) issued in europe by solesmes abbey should be offered for purchase in the united states. it's amazing how americans demonstrate contempt for themselves."
4,"Creepy, moralisitic fun!","I didn't like this book so much that I felt compelled to review it. Rather, I'm adding my two cents because I wanted to alert people that most of the other reviewers--typically those who didn't like the book--have chosen to ruin it for others by mentioning important plot twists that wouldn't otherwise be readily guessed.My opinion on the book though... I think Wiggins is a skilled writer and storyteller. I enjoyed the book enough that I couldn't put it down the night I finished it, despite knowing that it would give me nightmares. The comparisons to Lord of the Flies are inevitable, but it is its own work. Some complain of being bored or confused by the first half. I felt the first half established her writing prowess, and overall, I consider this book to be creepy, moralistic fun."
4,Little Women Meets Lord of the Flies,"Although I'd hesitate to recommend John Dollar to anyone I didn't know well, I found it a compelling, disturbing, and thought-provoking read. It's a bizarre combination of Lord of the Flies, Little Women, and Pink Flamingoes, and definitely not for the casual fiction reader. I was troubled by the novel's structure, which is almost two entirely different subplots pieced together on a thin thread. And many of the images are almost impossible to dismiss from memory, as much as I would like to. But if you're looking for challenging fiction, willing to completely ignore the annoying ""Study Group Questions"" provided by the publisher at the end, and up to the challenge of thinking hard about what an often-brilliant novel is pointing to, this book is something you'll want to read."
2,Not for me...,"This book is set around 1919. Charlotte, a widow, takes on a job of tutoring the daughters of British families in Rangoon. Charlotte falls into a passionate affair with John Dollar, the captain of a small ship. A picnic leads to series of tragic events.Wiggins does a terrific job in developing Charlotte's character and the environment she lived. On the other hand, I found the story line bouncing around from character to character and scene to scene during the first 100 pages (of a 214 page novel). I found the story and the other lightly developed characters difficult to follow.I'm a huge fan of Marianne Wiggins later works - ""Evidence of Things Unseen"" and ""The Shadow Catcher"" so I decided to try this earlier work. Unfortunately, this novel was not for me."
3,interesting read,i did not enjoy the first half of this book. i did not like how the story jumped from topic to topic. it didn't seem like it was being developed enough. the story picked up a lot once i reached the climax. from that point on i could not put the book down. the ending was twisted. i would recommecd this book.
2,Just OK,"This immobilizer is just OK. I ordered this for tendonitis I got from nursing my daughter, I wanted a second brace, so I could wash and alternate between the two. The support is not very giving to re-form. My doctor had to even work pretty hard at it, and he had stated when I told him that it wasn't very comfortable, that the support, or metal whatever, pushes right on the tendon, whereas my other one, supported above and below, making it much more comfortable. I ended up just buying another one, like my first, and hardly used this one."
5,Best splint I have tried!,I purchased this Thumb Immobilizer for the arthritis in my thumb after researching wrist and thumb supports. I didn't even know such a thing was available. It has made my life so much easier being able to keep my thumb supported without an awkard and bulky splint. I love that it can be used on either hand and I have used it for tenosynovitis of the wrist as well! I've tried other supports but this is the most comfortable. I can even sleep with it.
4,"Barabbas, Import","You should buy this. I promise. My only regret with this fine collection of leftovers is the import price. It boggles the mind as to why American audiences do not appreciate Chris Goss and his works. No American distribution hurts the wallet.The songs are less coherent than eitherMasters of RealityorSunrise on the Sufferbus, but that is to be expected. My understanding is that these tracks are from the cutting room floor of the two. Even though there is less of a cohesive feel, the album is solid and the tracks are just as memorable as anything from Blue and Suffer."
4,Decent reading for Class,It's intriguing book. I would recommend it to a professor or high school teacher for required readings. I've enjoyed this book as a student.
5,Great Stuff,"Stuff is a terrific exploration of the lifecyle of products and services that we pay for as consumers. This book feeds us info, but more importantly, shows us how to be more aware of what we consume and why. Great exercise for anyone interested in learning or teaching about our environment, (which should be everyone!)"
2,"Please, take up a new profession!","I am sorry to say that I have to disagree with the majority of readers. I found ""Stolen Moments"" an absolute dud. While Harley Jane Miller is an interesting character, Duncan Lang is a whiny nobody who keeps making references to some comtess so and so. Jeez, who cares? More importantly, Michelle Martin cannot write! Her syntax is terrible. And for me to notice is a pretty big deal, since I'm usually easy to please. From the looks of it, nobody edited this book before it went to print. Furthermore, the premise of this story was so improbable it made me want to gag. About half-way through the book I put it down in favour of something else. That's how much it had me enthralled. If Michelle Martin insists on writing, she should stick to lesbian erotica...as for the mainstream, please spare us."
5,EXCELLENT!,There's nothing better than discovering an author whose books you've never read. I am so impressed with Michelle Martin's writing. She's developed the plot and characters of Stolen Moments beautifully! Stolen Moments is my favorite of her books so far. Duncan is delicious and Harley is fascinating. I would suggest this book to everyone who enjoys good romance!
3,New Style,"For Jewel, she has often tried whatever it takes to really let the singer-songwriter image make it in the industry today. Although her last record didn't do very well, largely because the female singer-songwriter outlet wasn't there anymore. Still, she came back within a big surprise with her latest song, Intuition, from 0304. The song was unlike anything you'd expect from Jewel, taking chances with new styles in her sound and her voice. These are the stands acts like Liz Phair and Sugar Ray are taking to make their voices known to a different level. I really didn't like the new version Jewel did for her music. It seems a little catchy now, but it falls back down a little later on. Hopefully, she can make something that will blow everybody away."
4,"1st Offering, but ""playin' with the big boys""","I read a lot. Clancy, Brown, Coonts military-thrillers, Higgins' spies and heroes, Cussler's Bond-ish adventures; to the sci-fi & fantasy of Burroughs, and Doyle's Conan. Jondal has managed to combine elements of each and all...into one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in some time (including offerings by those above). An acquaintance turned me on to ""Passportal""...I've since passed my copy on and continue to recommend it to others. I'm anxious to see what else Jondal has up his sleeve ...he's a talent."
4,Wonderful First Offering,"Surprise, surprise! A book just under 500 pages that made me wish there was MORE to read! I can't wait for the sequel. This first time offering from the author was so good, I literally could not put it down. The story line focused on sci-fi creativity with just enough historical fact thrown in to really make you wonder ""what if he's really telling the truth""? Mr. Jondal does a great job of character development and his fight scenes are wonderfully vivid without being stomach churning. This book speaks to the real dangers we all face when we take too many things at face value, especially each other! The unique, quirky ending made me long for more. Hope I get it soon..."
5,The single most helpful book in getting my daughter started,potty training! She loved seeing her favorite Sesame Street characters in the book. The book is more geared for girls than boys. I think every girl who is potty training should have this book.
5,EPIC ON A CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Final Fantasy blew the doors open for the RPG genre. This game is pure epic. You cant go wrong with such a legendary game. It spans across a huge believable universe and is just so impressive.....Its really one of the best games of all time!
4,"Amazing game, some holes, good story,an adult's babysitter !","This game is like a novel one reads and participates in. The graphics are both great and yet ""rinky-dink"" simultaneously. There's so many games inside this game. Chocobo racing, fighting random onslaughts, ever developing power for the characters. It's like you go out, earn money, buy a better weapon, armor, magic, accessories, items, a room at an inn to heal your wounds! It took me 5 months to finish and I can't wait to start over again so I can get it right this time! Like a good book, there are some boring moments where you just have to watch scenes of character histories and events that can not be sped up, but those are good times to eat, refresh your libation, hit the lavoratory. I've renamed all the characters after people I know. This is the best RPG I ever played. Got to go feed my baby Chocobo. Ciao."
3,"I find this game is a bit on the gross side, and unusual.","You know it is cool in all, but Final Fantasy Mystic Quest(for snes)was better. Final Fantasy Tactics was best out of all ff games."
4,It's not as great as the hype,"Sure, the graphics were amazing for it's time, but let's focus on the real thing that makes people continue playing the game... the story... It was so amazing, and it could only be two things: A movie or a game... Square had no experience with movies, and it wouldn't have been as popular a movie because it wouldn't be 60 hours long.The fighting was actually better than most Final Fantasies, if you ignore the slowness of a single battle, which I did somewhat. I liked the system where you could level up your materia.Pretty good, not worth the hype thoughm sorry."
2,Best Ever? Not even Close.,Extremely linear game that becomes boring quickly. Much better than many console style RPGs but really should not be considered by experienced adult RPG fans.
2,"Ummmm, no.","What the hell was going on when you people did this!?!?! The only bit of help I got was in those few sections, where it's not exactly clear where you need to go next (i.e. City of the Ancients, Disc 2), and to help beginers with materia junctioning. And I am missing 2 and only 2 of the Enemy Skills, no thanks to the guide, which only gives you about 10. If you want secrets, hop online kiddiesm cuz this was just no good at all. I'm not even sure if it listed anything about thar damned, locked treasure in the man house in Kalm. Also, no 1/35 soldiers...I have 3! Where are the others? Save your money for something good."
3,Does not run on Windows Vista,"If you have Windows Vista or later, this game is going to be extremely difficult to play. I recommend playing it on an older system. Eidos hasn't bothered with supporting this game anymore, and I cannot play it on my Vista PC.If you have XP or earlier, there is support for it if you search online.Should you be able to play this game, you will enjoy it tremendously. My whole family played the game on Playstation years ago, and we all loved it. It's a damn shame it doesn't play on Vista.Good luck.PS- The vendor I bought the game from sent brand new discs and I was very impressed with the purchase.I just have to play it on an older PC."
4,A Review Of The Computer Version...Not The Game Itself,"If you want to know what to think of Final Fantasy VII the game...where have you been???The computer version is, at best, a nice version of FF7. Hey, I could play it on my laptop, so alright!But honestly, it's just sub-par to the PSX version. It's pre-rendered graphics are a bit fuzzy (essentially the background images) The character images are a little brighter and smoother, but then they feel out of place compared to the rest of the graphics. Personally, I think the 'graininess' of the PSX version lended to the overall atmosphere of the game, anyway.I will tell you, if you want to cheat your way through the game, a nice 'save file' editor will do nicely. But then what's the point, really?The point is, if you want this version of the classic, fine. It's good, and almost stands up there with the PSX version. But if you've never played it before, and you have a PSX or PS2, buy the PSX version. You'll be glad you did."
3,Fun!,It is a fun game the first time around and it still is; having some problems with the movies running on my computer.Ronna C.
5,Final Fantasy VII experienced,I had been looking for final fantasy VII for about 3 years.Awesome game. A++
3,Overated but worth the play,"This game has excellent characters and character depth - the best RPG around in that department. Unfortunately, the turn-based combat can grow very annoying by being sprung on you every 5 to 15 seconds whenever you're in a dangerous place. This timing system is especially annoying on the World Map when the timing is reduced from 5 to 10 seconds. This is a real downer in the game as the turn-based combat isn't even all that engaging and can grow quite tedious at times. However, with all that being true the game will just go on and on and is ideal if you want a long-term adventure. But be warned, don't expect to be entertained if you like atmospheric games. Anyone who hates 'cute' games should keep well away from this."
2,weird...,"This installment of the FF series was well... weird. I guess it is just me, because everyone else seems to love the game (why?). The games real time battle system was frustrating because well... I can't do everything or see everything at once! Also, the cartoonish style of the game (not to mention the cardboard figures and heartless charcters) really turned me off. In my opinon FFX is a much better game due to the obvious inhansment in graphices, cut scences, charcters, storyline, minigames, and entertainment. Maybe the game is better on the Playstation but if not buy FFX (possibly FF8 and FF9 but I haven't played them yet. Hopefully they will be better than FFVII)."
3,Great game---but . . ..,"No doubt about it, FF7 is a great game. Awesome graphics, cool story, very well-thought out.So why'd I take it back?Because I am not a big fan of swearing. If you don't want a game that swears at you every ten minutes, DO NOT GET THIS GAME. If swearing doesn't bother you, go ahead----you won't regret it."
5,Final Fantasy 7 on the PC,"Can we all say, ""awesome""? This game is by FAR the best game I have ever played and probably ever will. The beautifully computer-rendered graphics are incredible and bring you more into the world of the game. The story is the greatest ever done by SquareSoft. The characters with their own histories and stories add even more to the incredible depth that is already there. This game really deserves 7 stars!"
4,"Great, the best RPG ever, if not the best game ever.","If you liked Final Fantasy 1,2,3,4,5,or 6 then you will love this. It is the god of all RPGs. I will take you over 70 hours to complete and not for 1 minute does it get boring. The storyline is fantastic and will keep to griped. I recomend anyone thinking about buying the game should buy it."
4,"So far, the best RPG in America","Final Fantasy 7 is the best rpg I've ever played (but ff8 is coming out soon)! You play in a world of nature vs. technology, complete with commercial corruption, the supernatural, and a world crisis thrown in. The game is so much fun, it takes hours and hours to finish, the graphics are stunning (especially the full motion movies), and you can explore a huge beautiful world. The music is beautiful too, some songs just set up the mood for the setting, especially towards the beginning in the urban slums. Others are beautiful and symphonic, like the character Aeris' theme. This game is the best! The only problems with the PC version is that the CD's always fall out of the case they come in, and you need a fast computer with 3-D capabilities to fully appreciate the game."
4,Great RPG,If you love rpgs this is great. It is better on playstation though. It takes a lot of hours to beat so you better have some spare time.
5,THE Final Fantasy (or it should be),"I'll admit it, I'm only on the 1st CD, but this game has me hooked. The graphics are incredable, the music rocks, and I just love the story. This game has depth. The best part? Materia combos. It keeps the stratagy going long into the game, and it keeps you interested. Well worth $20!"
4,Very Rare indeed,"(I not a kid I'm just too lazy to login) Back in the year 2000 I knew basically nothing about RPG's except they were slow and boring. That was until my friend told me about this game FFVII. He said it was a lot of fun and I should get it. I searched for it everywhere including places like EBgames and KB Toys (which I might add is a good place to find hard to find stuff). It must have been fate that I got the last copy at Best buy. I loaded it up to my new computer and found it to be great. I played it for hours and I never truly gave up on it. I had to replay it from the begining about 3 or 4 times because of viruses but it never stopped me from beating it. Oh yeah if anyone is from Allentown PA. Check out Staples or OfficeMax in the area. I saw a copy for 10 dollars a couple months ago. It is a must have for Gamers to get them into RPG's.The Story is great, but the graphics are dated. The Chocobos are fun, but new computers need a patch to run it right."
5,Great Graphics and Good Sound (Depending on your sound card),"This game has fantastic graphics for the fight and summonses and outer world. Movies are a little to pixellated for me. Recommend downloading to your hard drive instead playing off of CD ROM, much faster (if you can afford the space). My 16MB Voodoo Banshee is wonderful for this game!!"
5,GOOD GOD! WHAT A WONDERFUL GAME!,"When I first installed the game I was ready to see some playstation all over the place. Boy oh boy was I wrong! As I got farther in the game I felt as though I was there talking with the charecters, and with battles! God, I've never seen an rpg fighting situation/layout so well put together before in my life! Whether I was casting Cure 3 or letting loose the fury of Knights of the Round I was dazzled and amazed by it's effects! I must say that Final Fantasy 7 is by far the best game/rpg ever!"
5,"WOW! WOW! WOW! *gasp, gasp, gasp* WOW! WOW!",THIS GAME RULES! Buy it now then come back and read these reviews! GO BUY IT! If you havent bought it yet... BUY IT! I don't know why but I have 2 favorite things in this game that make it better than even FF8. The first is Red XIII. He is the coolest character! He is like a lion type thing and he is smart too! The second thing is Bahmut. Bahmut is in FF8 but the FF7 bahmuts are better. Oh and one more thing FF7 has a wider variety of enemies over FF8.An estimated:FF7 monsters: 90FF8 monsters: 40Oh and by the way... you guessed it (or not) but BUY IT!
4,"This is a great game, you'll never want to stop","This game is highly addictive and fun. As Cloud Strife, you'll go through multiple CD's full of a very complex storyline from start to finish. A must have for all serious gamers."
4,Only FFVIII Can beat this game,This game has great graphics and a complex storyline that unravels as you play the game and the movies and the songs are the best in this game. This is the RPG game you'd want and Final Fantasy VIII will be what you'd want when it comes out!!!
4,This IS grate,If you haven't bought this yet then you don't know what's going on. I say buy this now and when you finish Final Fantasy VIII will be out (9/9/99) then you can beat that.I have beaten every thing in this game from the slums on Midgar to All the Weapons and the Forest. It can take over 59hrs 59min (when the clock stops) to 24hrs. Depends on what you what to get done in the game.
4,awwww......,i would LOVE this game but ff7 is only shipped to u.s adresses.too bad im in hong kong. now ill have to wait two months for it to be back in stock. *sigh* oh well...Final Fantasy game are probably one of the best RPGs ever.
4,One of the best games of all times!!!!,"I would recomend this game to allmost everybody, beautiful graphics and one of the best story line I've ever seen. Its on 4 CDs as you go through the game you learn more about the background Let me put it this way ""The More YOU play the more you like it"""
2,PC version is not up to par,"Be careful if you decide to buy the PC version of this game. I've owned both this version and the playstation version. I can say with conviction that if you purchase the game for the PC, then you will likely be setting yourself up for frustration.The first problem is that it will likely crash if you try to play this on a newer computer. You've also got to be aware that because this game was originally designed for the playstation, it generally won't run quite right on the computer. This means choppy or slow animation throughout the game (both cinematic and the gameplay portion). Sometimes the cinemas won't actually play, either."
3,"Great game, but doesn't work on many computers","Storywise, graphics wise, and fun-wise this game is great. If you can get it to work, that is. It is a notoriously buggy game that simply will not run on many computers without crashing every 15 minutes. Be sure to check out the tech support to see just how unreliable the game really is, and how little the company cares about making it work correctly."
5,Absolutely stunning storyline,"An unbelievably complex, deep plot which is strengthened by even more impressive characters. Absolutely incredible. I will never play another game like it. If you like action games and can't stand five minutes of plot development this game is not for you. The cutscenes are impressive but overall the graphics aren't great compared to today's standards. Final Fantasy VII is hands down a classic and the plot and characters by themselves lifted the game to a level above all other RPGs I've played. Not only does it have the best plot and characters of the FF series, but in my opinion of any video game ever made. If this was a book, it would be an instant classic. Surprisingly profound. I cannot say enough."
5,great game!,this is an awesome game! it really brings back memories! plus it has amazing graphics for its time!
2,OK GAME,"THE GAME IS FUN, BUT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS QUAKE II. GET A VOODOO2 CARD AND SEE WHAT I MEAN BY QUAKE HAVING JUST AS EXCELLENT GRAPHICS. BESIDES, SOMEONE SAID THAT IT IS SO GOOD THAT THEY CAN'T BEAT IT. WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I DON'T WANT A GAME THAT I CAN'T BEAT! GOOD GAME, BUT NOTHING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE."
3,its ok,"Well, going into it, I heard that this was SO much better than Quake III arena. I had played that game, and I liked it. So, I gave Unreal a go. After playing for a while, I played Quake III again. Within a few minutes, I quit Quake, uninstalled Unreal, and went back to playing Quake. The difference in the graphics was incredable. All the sharp edges are fine, but I perfer the revolutionaly rounded surfaces. Quake III blew Unreal out of the water graphically. What about the game play? Well, I was kidna dissapointed. Quake III is very intense, the kind of game you get caught up in. I found myself playing Unreal, just to see what it was like. It had no draw whatsoever. I thought the weapons were fairly difficult to use, and were kinda cheesy. For me, it is all Quake III."
3,"great graphics, but ti does have its flaws.","Unreal is a good game...Lots of hours of gameplay, good graphics, and nice weapons and enemies renderings. There is some flaws though. Its very dark and easy to get lost in. Also the game levels are more maze like than they are enemy-difficult. over all pretty good though.***"
4,Even better than Quake II,"In my humble oppinion this game is better the Quake II. The graphics is better, and the sound is so much better. If you have a Sound Blaster Live! card, then get this game, because it was designed to run on this card."
4,"Good game, but requires enourmous RAM and FAST processor",I have the MAC version of this game and it's fun but difficult to run because I don't have 128 megs of RAM and I don't have a G3 cpu. My system is pretty good but not state of the art--which is what is needed to play this game well. It takes forever to load.
5,Pretty cool,"A very fun game indeed, although the gamplay is a little boring. But overall a great game but defenetly costs WAY to much."
3,Myst for the Testosterone Set?,"Well, that's what CGW editor Jeff Green called ""Unreal"". After playing it, I'm inclined to agree. It incorporates (on a small scale) elements of adventure games, which slows down the first-person action without actually adding much weight to the alleged story. It does look nice, though, at least for a 1997 era game."
2,Low-quality game for a non-wealthy single player.,"This game is sooo below the expactations! It's got really nice graphics, rather good sound, but it lacks the most important thing; REAL GAMEPLAY. Unreal is incredibly boring when playing alone, and if you don't own one of the most expensive computers around you can just throw your low-guality game right down the trashcan. But if you're mister wealthyboy go on and buckle up for a quite nice ride in the Online-game store nearest to you."
3,Unreal is fun to play but its day is over.,For less than 10 dollars Unreal is fun and worth its cost but for hardcore gun-toting maniacs thrn Unreal Toyrnament is your calling. However if you just want to play a good shooter with nice graphics and to practice skills against an OK AI then Unreal is a good buy.
5,Simple TV holder,I got this for my new Toshiba 24 inch flat screen. I put it up the very same day with great ease.
2,Rick,"Came in disassemble, assembly was straight forward. Instructions were a little confusing. This was for my RV. First try I mounted to wall sideways.( bad instructions). Once installed I mounted a 19"" TV it has a slight tilt to one side.TV is crooked..Yes I leveled it correctly..Design is sketchy. I am replacing this ASAP..."
1,Biggest piece of junk I've ever bought,"Do not buy this wall mount... mine came half-assembled, with missing hardware, and some of the metal parts are bent completely out of shape make it impossible to mount or even be tightened into a working position. Waste of money."
2,Not as described,This was listed as a recent publication in the separate description but in fact it is the 1976 edition. Not what I wanted.
3,Not bad but could be better,"I expected a bit more but I admit my expectations were a bit high given that the author is a psychologist. If you're very new to psychic protection you might get some benefit but you're probably better off with another psychic shielding book. That being said, there were a few good points and perspectives and the book uses actual case-histories to make it's point which I always find interesting. If you find a cheap copy somewhere and you have the cash handy it might not be a bad read but don't lose any sleep over it. This IS a ""new age fru fru"" type of book. If you're looking for clinical stuff this is not what you want."
1,NEW AGE FRU FRU NO VALUE,Complete and utter fru fru. His best recommendation is to self hypnotise and gain your healing light.Get Robert Bruces book much better.GeoMutter
5,Outstanding Product -- but Buy Rechargeable Batteries!,"The JVC SU-DH1 is a very simple, elegant product: it provides full 5.1-channel surround sound through a set of standard headphones. And it works very well: the surround experience is just as enjoyable through headphones, without disturbing others. Thanks to this product, I can now enjoy movies late at night -- at full volume levels -- without having to worry about disturbing my neighbors.The only downside to this product is that it consumes batteries very quickly. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing a set of NiMH rechargeable batteries, preferably with a ""quick"" (15-minute) charger. I bought a Duracell 15-minute charger and a set of four NiMH batteries, and they work very well in this JVC."
3,A bit overpriced and not as durable as I had hoped...,I use these dividers to seperate sections out of an Avery 3 ring. I love the pockets and the colors are easy to discern from one another. Though since I have bought them two of the dividers have broken away. It started with a small crack then sort of worked its way apart. For as much as these are I sort of expected more. They are very useful so I don't regret my purchase. I just wish they would have been built better for what I paid.
1,...,the reason why I brought this online and not at staples is because they didn't have the specific colors I wanted anymore. But when I have receive the item it was the same colors as the ones selling at staples and the ones they have at the avery website. Im very upset and I cant return them because the shipping price is very expensive.....
1,Not worth the paper it is written on.,With all the books I have ever read this one comes to mind as the only one that has ever turned my stomach. I am sure there are many other ways of treating a subject like homophobia without going this route. I gave it one star because there was no option lower.
3,An Unfinished Story but Still Good,"Sooner or later this will come out in print, but right now it is available only in audio cassette format. Listening on my long trip to work on the train, I found it an unusually compelling and at times gripping reading, very professionally performed indeed, and of a story that is current and valid in our TV age. It reminded me a lot of how John Grisham sounds on audiotape. The only difference is, Grisham finishes his story. At the end of this tape there is still much to tell. It's not something that could be put in a sequel either; it belongs in this book. Well, let it be; it was still quite an experience."
4,Fort Bragg is a post not a base. Good book though,"The reader was wonderful and brought the characterization more to mind. First audio I've ever ""heard"".I usually enjoy reading more and forming my own inflections but this was a very well done book. Just the minor flaw of Fort Bragg being a Post not a Base. Can't believe that slipped by."
3,So-so,"4 stars for decent writing (I do enjoy Wolfe's style; AFB was my first encounter with this author)5 stars for a terrific reading by Edward Norton4 stars for a story that started strong2 stars for a weak 4th quarter and lousy non-endingOverall: 3 star averageEqual parts humorous and repellent, AFB is worth checking out for Wolfe's style alone. I gather Wolfe has deployed his talents to much greater effect elsewhere. If your choice is between AFB and some other Wolfe novel, I'd recommend going with the other."
1,"This can't be the ""real"" Tom Wolfe","I actually came to Amazon.com to make sure that the ""real"" Tom Wolfe actually wrote this. It seemed to be abridged -- there must have been more to it. Afterwards, I kept thinking of Peggy Lee -- Is that all there is?But I did figure out who was in the next stall."
1,Cardboard plot and characters,"Tom Wolfe's reputation is undisputed and his works rate highly. However, this was a complete bore. The characters are so one-dimensional. How many times have we seen the obnoxious TV news personality before? Stock southerners with hick attitudes. Despite a novella format it dragged on too long."
5,epic stories,This disk not only has beautiful pictures but also a fabulous story line. It is as much about the people of the area as it is about the nature. Very nice combination.
5,Well put together documentary,This documentary was well done. I visited India once it was nice to see more parts of it. I probably will not get a chance to visit it again.
4,A History Lesson With Breathtaking Photography!,- very educational and informative - with great photography - nature in all its splendour!- a very good buy!
4,Life & death in & along a great river,"This is a spectacular documentary of a river and area little known to most westerners. From the Himalayas to the delta this video covers the birds, fish, animals, plants and people who live in and around the Ganges.The video would have been better if the places covered were more clearly identified on a map. While a topographical map is shown throughout the video, cities and places are never identified on it. The narration is stunningly boring. The information given by the narrator is informative and of interest; however the voice is one unchanging monotone.Nevertheless this is an important video, presenting wildlife, settlements, people and of course the river, not frequently covered elsewhere."
5,Facinating and exotic culture and history of the most holy river,This film depicts the history of the holiest river in India...the Ganges. The very interesting cultures that honor it. The videography is fantastic and makes you feel that you are there.
3,Mediocre,There are 3 episodes to this video. The 2nd episode was not playing. I had it replaced. Episodes 1 & 3 are good on the replacement but episode 3 is still freezing here and there. I couldn't be bothered going thru the hassle of getting it replaced.
3,"Disappointed - more about species, tigers and less religious","Iam very disaapointed after watching the DVD.I bought this DVD expecting that it shows more about theGanges and it's religious importance and covers more aboutthe religios places Badrinath, Rudra Payaga, Rishikesh,Haridwar, Varanasi and so on. It mentioned little about itand more towards the species around the Ganges basin.It skipped fully Patna big city next to Ganges, and coverd fullepisode about Sunderban and tigers.It should have coverd 2 episodes from It's origin to Varansi,and 1 episode from varanasi thru it's journey towards Patna,Howrah and Bay of bengal.That aspect I disappointed, but the production quality wiseit's fantastic and very scenic.If you are looking for species and animals next to Gangesbasin this DVD is for you. If you are looking at religiousangle this is not for you."
1,Had to return it twice and twice it did not work!!!!,"Received in the mail, son very excited to watch (loves these movies) put in the dvd, doesn't play! return it get another one in a few days, put it in, same thing, does not work!!!! Just ended up getting the refund! I will say though, this has been my first bad experience with Amazon and they were very good on the return and refund!"
4,Fairly good documentary. Great HD imagery.,"I really enjoyed seeing the history and culture of India in high definition, since who knows if I'll ever have the chance to visit? One thing that disappointed me was all the focus on global warming. I understand the importance of keeping a clean environment, but please stop with the green mafia B.S. I can't take it anymore!Beyond that, this documentary was great. Made me almost feel like I was there, enough that I will be saving for that dream trip to India someday."
2,1080i = terrible resolution,I'm not reviewing the content of the movie since I turned it off after a few minutes. The resolution is terrible. What a waste. 1080i are you kidding me? I haven't even seen a 1080i television in years.
4,Poison live in concert,"Poison live in concert is the import version of Seven Days Live, exactly the same dvd with a different cover and title.Seven days Live first released on vhs in 1993 for the Native Tongue album, then finally released on dvd in 2003 as Poison live in concert with a new cover, and then re released again in 2006 with the original title and cover 'Seven Days Live'. The concert is fantastic and really rocks."
1,NOT genuine canon L-50,"When I did my search, I looked for only genuine Canon products, and this cartridge popped up as a Genuine Canon-L50 toner cartridge. In the product description it even mentions the importance of using genuine Canon parts. NOWHERE in the description did it mention it was NOT a genuine Canon cartridge, so imagine my surprise when I received the cartridge and opened it, only to find it was an equivalent, but not a genuine Canon product. Because it was not as advertised, I will NOT be doing business with this company again. As far as I'm concerned, it was faslely advertised, which is a shady business practice. Will it last as long as it is supposed to? I'll have to wait and see, but I am beyond upset. If it doesn't work at all, heads will roll."
5,Another Furst Feast...,"...And every page a tasty morsel. Furst takes us along on the intriguing odyssey of Pravda correspondent-slash-Russian spy Andre Szara through the darkening capitals of a continent descending inexorably into the abyss of unimaginable war. Few writers create a mood of time and place like Furst does. His characters are credible while often bordering on the outrageous. It's almost impossible to believe that Furst did not live and travel in the times and to the places he so accurately portrays. And while a few other reviewers here lament his detail, I, for one, find it irresistible -- particularly when he describes characters engaging in acts of espionage tradecraft. If you love historical spy novels nobody does it better than Alan Furst."
3,Not as Good as Night Soldiers,"My first exploration into Alan Furst was Night Soldiers. That was an excellent, can't put it down, read.Dark Star, not so much.I found the book very disjointed. I understand an author's need to make slight connections between characters and throughout the story, using vague language, which forces the reader to think. That makes for a better novel, in my opinion.That said, halfway through this book I'm still wondering what the heck is going on. It is a tiring read."
3,Atmoshphere Extraordinaire,Dark Star is an enjoyable read and simply seeths with the atmosphere of late 1930's Europe as Hitler's Germany militarized and ultimately mobilized east through Poland and then west.The descriptions of Paris are fabulous and could only have come from someone who has lived in the city of light. Scenes in pre-war Berlin and Poland during Germany's attack give a real picture to the history.Worth the read.
5,A wonderful insight into the mind of the 1930s,"Furst's recreation of the mind of a Soviet citizen going through the Stalinist purges while operating as a KGB spy in France, Germany, and Poland is an astounding achievement. Beautifully written, the book is remarkable for its ability to create three dimensions of even minor characters. I have reread it with pleasure."
2,Way too ponderous for me,"I am a huge WWII history fan, but this novel is so enthralled with its own overwrought descriptions of minor details (eg, the wine offered to Szara by the rich French Jew) that the story is lost and I stopped caring about the (lack of) action. I gave up half way through. On to the new translation of War and Peace."
3,Almost a great book,"Okay, first off, it don't understand what the title has to do with anything. Second, I don't understand why people claim that Furst is really good at making the European setting ""come alive"" - I don't think that mentionning a few car names and train travels would qualify as a great effort to represent the era either. That being said, it's far from a bad book. In fact, it reads really well, many of the characters are fascinating and the story really has some good twists. Maybe i was expecting too much out of it, being fascinated by the pre-war era and war itself, so i felt the book was a bit of a let down. Nonetheless, a spy novel worth reading if you already like the genre."
2,"Improbable, unlikable, inscrutable","Improbable events occur to an unlikable person, but luckily someone acting on inscrutable motives shows up at the last second to rescue him. Over and over, like the old Flash Gordon serials or the Batman TV show.A lot of people seem to love the doomy atmosphere of this John Le Carre imitation and the ""what if"" fantasies that form the plot, such as it is. The fact that all the twists are telegraphed pages in advance flatters the audience while contributing to the sense of fatalism. The writing is literate but pretentious (like le Carre's, only slightly worse).Drawing realistic humans is not Furst's strong point and the protagonist's recollections of his life clang embarrassingly. You can always tell when a flashback is coming, like movie musicals when everyone starts acting funny and you know a song is about to start. If you skip over those parts you'll enjoy the book more."
4,strange book,"It is a strange novel. The chief protagonist is a despicable human being (a communist eagerly participated in the killing of millions who started to think about all things human only when his turn to be wasted did come close), there are noticeable stretches and then there is some apparent weakness in research.At the same time there is some depth in this story, which is not so easy to describe, e.g. somehow I was inspired to take out a Mosing-Nagant rifle I own and just hold it my hands thinking about peoples fate in WWII."
3,eighty pages too long,"very good book, if a bit ponderous, but Furst overwrites like crazy and his editor should have made him cut it by 20%. A bit too much coffee drinking, introspection and Paris in the rain. A little less mood and a bit more action would have been nice."
1,Worst Book I have Ever Read!,"I struggled to finish this book. I kept hoping it would pick up but it never did! Painful reading that just kept getting more painful. It was like literary masturbation - the writer wrote just to write and never developed a plot to even feign there was ever an intention of a plot. The book just went on and on and on with prose that seemed to be written for the author's satisfaction - certainly not the reader's. Here's a hint to Furst - consider the reader and write a story that has some sort of a plot. Just drivel in my opinion. Don't waste your time or money on this horrible, horrible book. Wish Kindle gave refunds as I felt this was a total waste of time and money..."
4,Almost unreadable at start but gets better!,"I have read all of Alan Furst's books and have enjoyed all of them immensely. I recommend them to all my friends. But this one, Dark Star, I have found to be almost unreadable. I am only 25% done with the book and keep waiting for the pace and plot to pick up. I almost never leave a book un-finished, but I am close to stopping this one. I am very disappointed so far., but will let you know if it gets better.Wow, it gets better, just about the next page after I started this review, the plot picked up and i am now enjoying it.I know you might say, why didn't you just read the whole book before reviewing, and I would say you are right, except that I found the first 25% of the book to be so relatively un-readable."
2,Chilton's ain't what it used to be!,"I have bought other Chilton Manuals in the past and have found them very useful. Not this one. I've only read one section for now (Chevrolet B body) but based on that, this manual is severley lacking. The other Chilton manuals gave a lot of engine data and detail. That is missing. What diagrams that are included are so small as to be useless. They resemble thumbnail photos, but since this is a printed book, there is no enlarging.Try the public library first. If they have one and the detail suits you, then buy one, if you need it. Otherwise, keep looking. This is what I wish I had done."
1,GT2 and GT3 are much better,Only played a demo. Sure the graphics are great for PS1. but that really doesn't make up for it. The racing title 'Sega GT' which is complete rubbish. is better. I have Gran Turismo 2 and Gran Turismo 3:A-Spec which are much better games. GT4 will be even better than those 2 And so will be GT5.
5,"1 flaw, but big whoopdedo","I'll get to the point without boring you. The only flaw is that several, the GTO, Skyline, and Impreza get about a 500 hp boost which makes them nearly untouchable, and , to be blatant, the british cars suck, which isn't the case in real life. although it doesnt totally give credit the the cars where it is deserved, this is the only game I play these days. Im thinking of getting GT2 now, since everything Ive heard about it is great."
5,This game is fun,"To be skillful at this game you need a good working knowledge of cars and driving. The real challenge is buying the accurately depicted cars and tuning them to the max. It is an effective tool in learning gear ratios, torque curves and suspension dynamics. It challenges your mental skills and stimulates your interest in car dynamics and you have fun doing it. It is non-violent, the cars do not dent in crashes.Definately an adult game. Kids may not understand the driving and tuing nuances but teenagers like it. Enjoy!"
1,PROTECTED CD WONT PLAY PROPERLY ON COMPUTER,PROTECTED CD WONT PLAY PROPERLY ON COMPUTER. Great cd but not for you if you want to rip it.
1,Practice Tests Poor; Lessons Only Marginally Better,"Three points:1) The questions on the three practice tests provided on CD (or, more accurately, linked to by the CD) are NOT real GMAT questions.2) About 60% of the questions on the second practice test were also on the first practice test (I didn't bother taking the third practice test).3) The text lessons are only marginally more instructive."
5,OUTSTANDING,"I AM RICH POTOSI presents a stirring portrayal of a courageous, determined people. Stephen Ferry's work is a major contribution to understanding the colonization of the America's and the ongoing struggle of indigenous people's. The photographs and text capture Potosi's vibrant culture, and enormous historical significance. This is journalism at its best."
1,FUNNY PICTURES,"I'll try to make a constructive critique as a Bolivian born and raised in Potosi. As some of the books published in the US, this book portrays foreign life styles with an ""american"" mentality that is narrow in concept visualization as a whole. Yes, those pictures show a very harsh reality among ""mineros"" in Potosi. However, the pictures do not show, in any form, the subtle aspects of their lives that make them really unique and respectable. The photographer would have to live a reasonable time with them to really understand the situation and I'm sure he would take pictures with a different approach. By the way, I'm also a photographer."
2,Ready to Switch,"I've had this book for about ten years and am ready to switch. I kept it for so long because it is conservative and orderly. But it is completely lacking in certain subjects that are not uncommon. Also, because the authors are Brits, a lot of the vocabulary is very unfamiliar. It is also very dissappointing to look up a dream and be told all other factors in the dream must be looked up, but you get NO explanation at all of the subject of your dream. There are a lot of incomplete explanations as well,and no matter how many other factors you look up, it is impossible to piece these meanings together for a full explanation.Frusterating!"
3,Dream book with some British words,"The two authors are British. Their words in the dictionary are reflective of the way they speak. Think like a Brit (remember all those James Bond movies??)and you'll find this book that much more helpful. Also: the authors compiled all the ""definitions"" from their research on dream interpretation, going back hundreds of years. So, some of the symbols may not ""match"" with symbols of modern-day life. All in all, this is a fun little book to have on the nightstand. Of course there's no book that will interpret YOUR dream--it's yours. But some of the definitions in this book will get you thinking about what YOUR symbols may mean. And that's the most any book can promise. Lastly, I also agree that keeping a dream journal will offer you all sorts of insights that no book will come close to matching. Sweet dreams!"
5,Very interesting book,"This is a great book. I don't take things like this that seriously but I think this is very interesting for entertainment purposes. It is a good ""thumb through"" book."
1,Dreamer's Dictionary Review,This is not a very current book. The descriptions are very old and do not reflect modern explanations. I was very disappointed in this book.
1,Superstitious nonsense!,"If you believe that your dreams are a crystal ball to the future this book is for you. If you are seriously trying to analyze the meanings of your nocturnal theater, FORGET THIS BOOK! Every third dream symbol is an omen of impending financial success and every other third symbol is an omen of financial ruins. Save the money and read your horoscope in the newspaper."
5,Your dreams are really telling you something - listen!,"I presently own the May, 1975 version and I am looking forthe newer version. As I normally use this book almostevery day, I have actually worn most of the print off mycover and even had to tape the cover back on several times.I am truly amazed at how I can look up a dream and then,""bingo"", the predictions come true! It's utterly amazing!There have even been times that I woke up in the middle ofthe night and have either written down my dream, or takenout my dream book and analized it right away for fear thatby breakfast, I may not be able to recall all the details.Wonderfully entertaining book for all year round and almostany age. Everybody continues to dream which will alwaysleave a use for this book!"
3,Weird Dreamer,"I have strange dreams and thought this would help me find the meanings. You look up things one item at a time ie green, bike, etc. who knows if its right.kind of interesting though."
4,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a dream analasys book that told you what your subconcious was telling you about the day before, but this book is more of a psychic future telling book and it wasn't what I was looking for. Besides the misunderstanding, it is interesting, and it does have a wide variety of symbols and junk. It's great if you like to believe that your dreams tell you about the future, but not what I was looking for"
4,Good,"This will answer the vast majority of your questions about your dreams and what they mean. I found a few items that I've had in dreams that aren't in here, but I can live with that; I have weird dreams anyway. This will guide you on the path to inner truth and what the symbolism of your dreams mean."
2,Not a lot of Meanings,"This book isn't the best type for me it lacked a lot of basic dreams like sexual and things like that, of course if your not one to dream about vulgar things it also had me running around the book to find meanings, I had a dream of watching some one cheat but it had nothing on that, it had nothing on tornado's, another dream I had involved gun shots and I had to look up fights just to find something, if your not good at coming up with other names to explain something I'd suggest another book."
5,"Enlightning, Informative, and Accurate","This book has added so much insight to my life. It has helped to interpret happy, troubling and odd dreams that have guided me through lifes many paths. It offers you hope, inspiration, and warnings, if you choose to beleive. You must read the beginning to understand how to interpret a dream. That is the key. I keep it by my bed. I bought my book in 1985 and it has been my sole source for interpretations. I trust it!"
1,Disappointed,"I have attempted to analyze my dreams with the help of this book, and have repeatedly found it lacking. More often then not, key elements of my dream simply weren't mentioned in this book (and I don't think it is because my brain is wired differently than the rest of our species). I am hoping to find a better book."
5,I love this book,When I bought this book I thought I'd like it. I was wrong...I love it! The copy I have is practically falling apart because I've used it so much. There is almost every symbol you could think of in here....and some you probably wouldn't. A great book for any dreamer.
3,So-So,"I guess I would have to agree with Laura Haggarty. This book is ok. But that's it. It has been a lot better than some other dream dictionaries I've read. However, the dictionary is small, which means not a whole lot of definitions. If you have a dream, you would (proabably) have to choose another topic of your dream (like something else you noticed in the dream). This dream dictionary is very basic."
2,Not very good,"I was disappointed with The Dreamer's Dictionary. If you are looking for excellent dream interpretation books, I highly recommend I Had the Strangest Dream by Kelly Sullivan Walden and my favorite is In Your Dreams by Mary Summer Rain. These books give an amazing amount of information and I think they give accurate interpretations. Dream interpretation is very important and most people need help understanding their dreams so good books on dream interpretation are very valuable. I also like Watch Your Dreams by Ann Ree Colton."
3,excellent book for dreamers,"After another sleepless night dreaming multiple dreams I picked this book up at Barnes & Noble to help me interpet some disturbing dreams. I think it should be taken with a grain of salt, but I also don't think we should ignore dreams or visions."
1,Pure Made-up Trash,"I can't believe anyone would flip through this book and actually want to buy it. Mine was given to me by a friend who didn't want it anymore.All it does is list things that you could dream about, and then try to predict the future from those dream symbols. Everyone's dream symbols are different in relating to different things in their lives. It's ridiculous to say (for an actual example from the book) that dreaming about a kangaroo means your going to take an exciting trip. I think the authors who wrote this were ""on an exciting trip"" to Never-Never Land when they wrote this piece of garbage."
4,Special Circumstances,This was a very interesting book and held your interest. It should have been getting more press on it. I still haven't seen it in the book store.
4,Grabbed Me But Didn't Hang On,"I was interested in this book from the first chapter, despite the many character descriptions that proved hard to keep straight. The story was well plotted and cleanly written, the people reasonably interesting, and the mystery plenty mysterious enough. But for some reason at about chapter twelve or so I started losing it. I had a good idea how it would all end and didn't feel like spending another three hours with this book getting there, so I flipped to the last chapter to test my theory. I was wrong on some counts, right on others. But I wasn't sad I'd missed the middle.I have a feeling legal thrillers just aren't my thing and I don't want to do the author an injustice by underrating Special Circumstances, since it is certainly well written, so I'm giving it four stars even if I couldn't finish it. But be warned -- if, like me, the legal doesn't grab you, Special Circumstances may not either."
3,Not his best.,"The negatives - it didn't seem that this would have been considered a 1st degree homicide, particularly with special circumstances and I felt the ending was very weak. The positives - I love the characters of Mike and Rosie, I enjoy his humor, and he certainly knows San Francisco. I'll definitely keep reading Siegel, but his wasn't his best."
2,Plenty of four letter words,"Although the story line could be interesting, this tape is filled with constant profanity. I couldn't understand why the author felt this was necessary because the characters are interesting, the plot is a good one and all the sex and four letter words are totally unecessary. I would not recommend this tape if you are sensitive to bad language. If it's murder, intrique and courtroom drama you want, save your money on this one and go for an author who really knows how to write a good book."
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME,"I love legal thrillers. I read every one of them that I can get my hands on. Lately, however, I have found that even the authors that I have loved are not able to maintain consistancy. This book is a rare treat. I actually find myself trying to read it a little more slowly so that it doesn't end. Great story, great characters, great way with words. I have not enjoyed a book of this genre to this degree in a very long time."
5,Pittsburgh Pirates 1979 Championship Baseball Season,"Needless to say, a book for the true Pittsburgh Pirates fan.Black and white photos throughout, except for 8 page color photo section."
1,Lousy as a real simulator,"While the scenery, airport,& navaid database is much improved, the actual simulator is a step back from 5.1 . Flight controls are ""flaky"" and impossible to trim for stable flight. Even 5.1 can accomplish this! Have tried on 3 different systems operating with the latest sound and video cards but results are disappointing. Buy something else."
4,Very fun to play.,"I don't think that this game is very educational, except that people might gain some knowledge (very little) about how to pilot something. Trust me, the first time I tried it, I was so bad that my plane crashed every time. However, I think that this is one of the best games you could buy; non-violent (except for maybe the planes crashing); fun."
4,Great fun.,"This is a great simulator, full of great pictures of popular places from around the world and choices of planes to fly. It just needs alittle fine tuning to make it five star"
1,Disappointing,"This flight simulator leaves much to be desired. If you're thinking of getting this, get Flight Unlimited II instead. If you got this already, pray you can exchange."
4,A best buy!,As a simulator pilot I try plenty of simulators and i must say by far this is the best. It is not expensive but is very realistic.It is a great trainer for everyone of all ages.I fyou are looking for a sim with great graphics and realism Flight simulator 98 is the sim for you!
3,Lists and More Lists,"I think I'd rather I'd read this at Barnes and Noble or at a library than bought the book. It's good for people who need help learning about the disability and are new to the subject, specifically for elemetery age kids. But for those who are older of us who are looking to learn some new things, it's a giant book of lists and you know how organized us ADD people are... Hey look something shiney!"
3,A little overwhelming,"Positives: So much information! Each page can be copied and given as handouts to parents. Covers issues for children at all ages.Negatives: Handouts might be written at too high of a reading level for some parents. Out of 124 handouts/topics, I've used less than 20."
3,London Beauty Saloon Story,"A story of the Londoners of a beauty salon is a bit long and boring as characters mixed up between their affairs and bedrooms, leaving at the end in the de-facto open relationship.I was surprised to realise that this library-borrowed DVD set is Season 2 only as no signs Australian produced box provided yet-also I owned Hong Kong made seven disk edition awaiting time to watch it otherwise. And recently, it will wait much long time me to return to."
1,Makes No sense,The review of this book from the reader in VA makes no sense... Why would you post a review that makes no sense and adds nothing?
1,Ammend Review,"Dear AmazonEarlier today I reviewed this book.I am not sure whether I requested it, but I would prefer that my name and email address do not appear with my review of the book.Thank you."
2,Not a great substitute for Microprose Grand Prix 2,"After reading some puffed up reviews on the Internet all I can say is that the game play is dissapointing overall. Sure updated graphics are nice , but the game play and in car sounds are just ok."
5,Answers all of the FAQs of the Tae Bo video series.,"I have been doing Tae Bo regularly for nearly six months. During that period I have been thrilled by the results I've been getting, yet I have not always been confident of my technique or the level of my workout.Finally, Billy Blanks has provided the answers to all of my questions in his new book. He talks about technique, optimum heart rate, and how to judge your fitness level. He weighs in on how often to work out and how many calories you will burn per hour.This book is a motivator because it will enhance your confidence and make you an expert!!"
4,GREAT GRAPHICS BUT LACKING IN A GOOD THEME,"There could have been nothin better for x files fans when they heard of this game being released.it had actual movie graphics,a good gameplay,what this game lacked was the chills one gets while watch x files.there wasnt much action or a spooky feel to it.the biggest drawback was that u dont get much of mulder and scully.the biggest advantage was that u play as agent craig wilmore in search of mulder and scully who have dissapeared and make them look like two rookies throughout the game.whatever i say or one has to say,i feel u must buy this game,cause u wont be dissapointed.i personally feel that another game on x files should be made but with a little more of horror.thats realy what this game lacks.once again id still say its worth the money."
3,Don't get stuck!,"The only problem I have had with this game is several times I have gotten stuck somewhere in the game and couldn't continue on. I even tried putting it on easy mode where it gives you hints about what you are to do next. It wouldn't even do that. After starting the game over I didn't have that problem when i reached the place I was stuck at before. Don't save your game until you know that you are not stuck somewhere in the game, otherwise you will have to start it over like me. Other than that, I thought it was a pretty neat game."
4,X-Files The game,"Although many people have downgraded this game; I did find it both intriguing and even heart pounding with the scenes and investigations. If you are a fan of the X-Files television show-then this would be a must for your collection! Although most games do fall short in some areas and are not perfect, this one is worth getting-and solving a couple of different times..."
5,Do do DO do DOO dooooooo,"Okay, you're NOT Fox or Scully, BUT they make their little appearances throughout the game as does Skinner. This was one of the first adventure games I ever played so at the time it seemed pretty difficult. In retrospect, it might seem a bit easier but still the same engrossing game. Lots and lots of investigating, searching for hotspots and all that.Good things:1. lengthy with strong story the whole way2. good brain challenge3. excellent visually and fab soundtrack4. it ran great on win985. you get second chances, and thirds, fourths, fifths......Not so good things:1. not enought fox and dana2. there's a shootem' up part and I'm not a fan3. no follow-up game? what gives chris carter?Overall, worth the effort as long as you have patience and LOVE to explore."
3,A pixel hunt game that held my attention!,"I'll say right off that I really don't like Myst and many other puzzle pixel hunt games. However, this game really somehow held my attention. It was suprisingly fun to play and the videos were very entertaining. I do agree with others that more Mulder and Scully would have been a plus but the game was still really fun to play."
4,So close yet so far,"I absolutely loved this game. It has everything I enjoy about computer games and more. I'm not an X-files fan but the characters and situations were still enjoyable to me. I like the interface and inventory and overall gameplay. The one disappointing thing about the game was the possibility of dying. I counter this by being careful to save before doing anything rash. However, when I was right at the end of the game, I killed someone who, apparently, was supposed to come and help me later on. The game should not allow me to get into this no-win situation! I had come so far and now I would have to start over in order to see the end of the game. Very disappointing."
2,I'm glad I didn't pay too much for this...,"....The first (and biggest) disappointment is that you have to play a guy named Craig Willmore. I was hoping to play Scully or Mulder. But the video shots of them were very nice indeed, though you have to wait until the end to see them.Then, I think it is actually very weird to play at some points, because sometimes POV ends up in awkward angles. I can't explain it very well, but sometimes you are not behind your character. It seems as if the POV changes at some points. I didn't like that either.Even after that, It was too easy. I beat the entire game in one weekend. ...I recommend it ONLY for rabid X-Files fans. All other people will probably not be impressed."
2,New Weird Al CD a disappointment,"I've been a fan of Weird Al for years, but even I've gotta admit this is one of his lamer efforts. The first single is a parody of a song most of us are too young to remember, and the other parodies sink to being nasty instead of funny. The jab at Helen Keller in ""Pentiums"" was WAY out of line, ""Rabbi"" makes fun of Jews, and the original songs also aren't as good as his previous efforts. ""Albuquerque"" has a meaningless lyric that drones on for more than 10 minutes. If you liked Weird Al classics like ""Amish Paradise"", ""Like A Surgeon"", or ""One More Minute"", you won't find any such classics here. And there's only ONE song about food on this album! The humor of this album is so watered-down, it's like somebody trying to imitate Weird Al. Too bad, I'd really been looking forward to this album. Now I wish I'd have saved my money and bought it at the used CD store."
5,ALS BEST CD!!!,This is Al's best cdTHE SAGA BEGINS:5/5 Great song about Star Wars Ep1MY BABYS IN LOVE WITH EDDIE VEDER: 5/5 Great songPRETTY FLY FOR A RABBI: 5/5 Cool songTHE WEIRD AL SHOW THEME: 5/5 GoodJERRY SPRINGER: 5/5 Great funny songGERMS: 5/5 Good songPOLKA POWER!: 5/5 Great polkaYOUR HOROSCOPE FOR TODAY: 5/5 Funny song about horoscopesIT'S ALL ABOUT THE PENTIUMS: 5/5 Cool songTRUCK DRIVIN'SONG: 4/5 Ok songGRAPEFRUIT DIET: 5/5 Good song about food not as funny as FatALBUQERQUE: 5/5 A funny 11 Minute song
3,Good at first but got old soon,When I first ordered this cd I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread.A lot of his song's were very funny at first but repation of the song made it grow old fast. Now it's sitting at home in my cd rack picking up dust. I sugest listening to the whole cd before buying it.
4,Pretty good,"Al just keeps getting better. As usual, this is a mix of parodies and his own creations. One of his songs, ""Germs"" is pretty good for a creation of his own. It reminds me of ""Closer"" by Nine Inch Nails. It would get 5 stars if he would have left off the last 11 minute track (it sucks) and put another parody or two in it's place."
4,Another gem from Al,"Saga Begins, Jerry Springer, Pretty Fly for a Rabbi, and Grapefruit Diet are all great parodies. His polkas seem to be getting better with each new album. He usually hits the mark with at least one of his original songs, but he might not have a great one here."
4,Weird Al's for you,"Hi,What more to say that all the others haven't said before. If you weren't a Weird Al fan before and you stumbled upon this CD, try ""The Saga Begins"" and ""Jerry Springer"". Those are my two personal favorites and mainly the reason I bought the CD.If you find you like those songs and perhaps the rest of the album, try some of his others. I personally don't have any of his other albums, but there are a couple of greatest hits albums you might want to try. :) You won't be disappointed!"
1,"The Saga Begins is great, but the rest is worthless..","I bought this CD to have a copy of ""The Saga Begins"" which I think is great. (Story of the Phantom Menace set to the tune of American Pie.) However, I was disappointed by the rest of the CD. Hopefully Weird Al will get back to doing some of his better stuff soon."
1,He is soooo stupid.,"I HATE WEIRD AL!!!!!!!!!!!! And I hate him even more for making fun of the Barenaked Ladies. Al's not even funny!! Putting swears and sexual references in a very nice song, ""One Week""...how could you?!? Al, you are over!! (Don't worry Ladies, that insane guy won't hurt your songs again! I'll make sure of that!)"
4,Running with Scissors,"It's so stupid that it's funny. that;s why people like Wierd Al....because he's wierd. Some funny stuff on here though, like ""The Saga Begins""."
4,"Better than ""Bad Hair Day""","Don't pay any attention to the Amazon.com review. This is a FUNNY album! To begin with, the ""Saga Begins"" song had me rolling on the floor, and ""Grapefruit Diet"" takes me back to his great hits like ""Fat"" and his many food songs. I have a friend who watches Jerry Springer all the time, and Al's song about the Jerry Springer Show is right on the money! The only song I was unimpressed with is the ""Truck Drivin' Song."" Dang funny album, people. Get it."
5,One of the best Weird Al CD,"I would highly recomemed it. The best song on the Al-bum is ""The Saga Begins"". It a parody of ""Aemrican Pie"" Weird Al writes about all teh Star Wars people. Another great song is ""albequre""...i dont know how to spell it. It is not really a song. Its just about how much he hate sour croud. Its a 11 minutes of words with backround music. some of teh worst songs to me are GRems, Grapefruit Diet, and YOur Horoscope For Today""I hope it was helpful"
3,Alright,"This is an alright album from ""Weird Al Yankavic"". ""Pretty Fly (For a Rabbi)"" and ""The Saga Begins"" are my 2 favorite songs."
4,Running with siscors,"I really loved ""Weird Al's"" new cd. It was so funny! :) I laughed the whole way through. I listen to it all the time. This is defeinetly his best cd so far! :)(:"
5,"""Weird Al"" Yankovic Rules!","Weird Al is ONE of my favorite music artists. I am a big fan of his, but I wish I had enough money to buy his other CD's. Has anyone out there seen Video 1's ""Weird Al"" Yankovic Behind The Music episode? Well, if you haven't I suggest you do. It's the best, It tells about his whole life and how he came to be."
5,I loved it!,"My favorite song, ""Germs"", is really funny. A definite buy for anyone looking for a laugh. Everyone in my family, from age 6 to my parents loved it. It's worth every penny!"
5,weird al rocks!,"i love the song ""saga begins"". everyone song on this cd is a winner. fun for all ages! let's all pick on eddie vedder and bill gates for a few minutes! you know you want to.."
3,wierd al has changed.,"to me it seems off the deep end was his last good album. his newer stuff just ain't good, he's not as psychoticly cheesy as he used to be, nor as violent. but their are alot of good songs oh this album, alot more than off the horrible alapalooza or bad hair day albums. check it out, but IN 3D is still his best."
5,Weird Al shows again how clever he can be.,"Weird Al has always been known to write clever lyrics, but when I first heard ""All About the Pentiums"" I realized what a <evil> genius he is... To fit all the one-liners into a song and have it flow so well is Awesome! And Puffys background music Rocks! Oh yeah, the rest of the Cd is good too :-)"
5,"Wacka, wacka doo doo yeah!","I'm all for a completely original ""Weird Al"" release, so I was incredibly satisfied by the volume of Al-written songs. I can't continue this coherently... can't concentrate because I'm listening to the CD. Again."
5,AL'S BEST!,"Always been an AL fan, but not since EVEN WORSE have I loved a CD so much! Buy this CD just for the songs ""Albuquerque"" (funniest song he's ever done!) and ""It's All About the Pentiums"". Also, make sure to pop the CD in to your computer to access ""Secret Files""!!!! (don't tell anyone!)Al's best yet!"
5,What the...?,"I've been a big weird al fan since off the deep end, so it's a granted that I'll pretty much love anything he does. Something does bug me though, and it's not this album. One reviewer made a correction that the song ""germs"" is not a parody of NIN's ""Closer"". This is correct, it is a parody of NIN's ""Terrible Lie"". He ALSO said ""Terrible Lie"" and ""Closer"" are on the same album. NO, they are not. OMG!!! Like. Correct Right. ""Terrible Lie"" appears on the 1989 NIN release entitled ""Pretty Hate Machine"" and ""Closer"" appears on the 1994 NIN release ""The Downward Spiral"". Also, it should be known that although the song ""Germs"" sounds like ""Terrible Lie"", it is not credited in the booklet. Trent Reznor and Weird Al should hook up on a record. Anyway, I'm OCD apparently and I really need sleep. Goodbye!"
4,Run with the scissors!,"This album is very funny! It is much better than his past work. It's seems hard to write parodies and keep up with current music styles, but Al has done it before, and he did it again.But why four stars? Simple. Some of the songs get boring, and boring fast. Especially ""The Saga Begins"", especially the refrain. Another good example is ""Albuquerque"", which is a 12 minute song of this guy's adventure through the city, which includes flesh-eating weasels, sitting between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor, and a hermaphodite with a flock of seagulls haircut and only one nostril.A very funny crazy song would be ""Your Horoscope For Today"". (Email me with your Zodiac sign if you'd like to hear your horoscope in that song! Funny!) I guess it's only very funny if you hear it with the tune.So if you're deciding on which CD to buy, and you like weird humor, I'm telling you, run with the scissors!"
5,"E Torrone, Smells like nirvana isn't on this album...","... and it was written in 1992(before Cobain's death) and approved by Cobain himself. If you don't like parodies, don't buy Weird Al, but its idiotic to say this is for 5-year olds since young children wouldn't get all(read:any) of the references(much like E Torrone himself). Is Al a genius; no, but he certainly is more of one than most of the 'serious artists' out there."
5,Hilarious,"This is a funny CD. ""Germs"" and ""Alberqurque"" are the best songs, even though the latter is almost twelve minutes. ""Polka Power!"" is cool, too. Someone should realease a polka version of this CD."
4,the rewiew,"i have this cd at home at it is a very halarious album. it is't offensive but you can't sing with it, you'll be laughing to much"
4,Wonderful Song Parodies,"I love song parodies and here are some of Weird Al's best. ""The Saga Begins"" is especially memorable. He tells the story of Star Wars, Episode I to the tune of ""American Pie"".... My, my this here Anakin guy... maybe Vader someday later now he's just a small fry.... Another winner is ""Pretty Fly for a Rabbi"".Nothing is too sacred for Weird Al. I recommend this to all fans of song parodies and slightly skewed humor."
3,Songs are just a bit too long.,"A mostly enjoyable CD, but the songs just seem to go on and on. In fact, Al does not have enough space in the liner notes to list all the words of the songs. Still, most of the songs are enjoyable and creative. But not his best work."
5,comic genius,"First let me say that I'm not a member of ""Close and Personal Friends of Al"", but this CD is too funny. Best track has to be ""The Saga Beings"". The fact that the man was able put the entire plot of Star Wars I: TPM to the tune of Don Mclean's American Pie is just too much. I played that song over and over again. The video is even better."
5,weird al greatest album to date,"This is weird al's best album. Start with his parodies. The saga begins is good. Jerry Springer, pretty fly for a rabbi, it's all about the pentiums, grapefrtuit diet are great. The original songs are good as well. The horroscope song, germs, truck driving, and the medley are pretty good. The alburqueque song is really a comedy routine and the theme to his show is just an added bonus. This is a well made album and very entertaining."
5,It's Great!,"I'd just like to say what a great C.D this was, and I hope that you guys out there will bye it."
4,"Not Al's best, but still really good","Al has some of his best songs here, but some duds as well. I rate ""Jerry Springer"" as one of his best parodies ever, up there with ""Taco Grande"", ""Ricky"" and ""Eat It"". The best original on the CD is ""My Baby's In Love With Eddie Vedder"" and may rank with his all-time best, such as ""One More Minute"". But some tracks are less than his best. ""Germs"" is annoying and isn't even relevant any more (has anyone even HEARD a Nine Inch Nails song anywhere in 3 or 4 years?). ""Albequerque"" gets tedious very quickly. ""Grapefruit Diet"" is just yet another song about being fat. It's getting old. The rest are typical Al songs (i.e. good). Basically, I like all songs except the three named above. A good effort, but not quite his best..."
5,A Man With Real Style !!!,"If you want a man with talent, style, originality, intelligence, and far-out whackiness then Weird Al Yankovic is your man.Out of all the music I have listened to this is truley the best music you can buy. His music is so positive it gives you almost a spark of energy and brings you up emotionally. This man puts effort and time into his work and his sense of humor is just far out great! I have been listening to him ever since I was eight and ever album he comes out with just keeps getting better and better. But ""Running With Scissors"" was his best. ""Poodle Hat"" was good but not as good as his 1999 release.Every song is enjoyable and you may even find yourself jumping up and down dancing like a drunk polar bear. Hey! You never know!Unlike all the other negative music out there Weird Al Yankovic brings you positive and happy music!Just buy the CD already!Weird Al Yankovic ~ 100 stars out of 10 stars"
5,It Takes a Tough Genius to make a Tender Fool!,"Al Yankovic is a genius! No, I mean, a REAL, certifiable genius! In his wayward youth, he got a kick outta doing math problems, just for fun! How sick is THAT! I'm a long time fan of Al's. His music has always been a delight! He can craft humor that'll get ya rolling everytime, and I often find myself smiling and chuckling at songs he wrote 20 years ago, that I've heard a million times! It never gets old! His comic palette uses every color with deft skill--from droll, completely STUPID, clown hammer classic to insightful, multi-layered social commentary, that will have you thinking for years to come. And, best of all, I've had the honor and privelege of meeting him myself: He's a REALLY wonderful, sweet person and a great role model for kids! Not only is he a great artist, he's a great person. Will wonders never cease!"
4,"This is a pretty good Weird Al record, but it's not the best","Weird Al Yancovic has done it again with this new album of his, Running with Scissors. It features some great parodies, such as ""Pretty Fly For A Rabbi"", the parody of the Offspring's ""Pretty Fly for a White Guy"". He has also unleashed a very Zappa-esque 10-minute monologue/jam onto Running with Scissors, namely ""Albuquerque"". But, having been an Al fan since I was in first grade, I have to say this is not the best Weird Al album of all. It's a pretty good album, but Al used too many songs that were already funny in the first place - ""One Week"" and ""Pretty Fly For A White Guy"" come to mind. Aside from that, the lyrics are just not as funny as on the older albums like Even Worse, UHF, or In 3D. It was, in my opinion, funnier when it was just Al on his accordion."
4,"Pobody's Nerfect (""In Australia"")","Al still has the talent that kept him popular in the 80's, and I enjoyed this one also. But, then again, I own, excluding GH2 and Ameoba, every recording he's done. I loved watching the 15-minute excerpt from ""There's No Going Home"" from the Disney channel on my computer. The only real downside, IMHO, is ""The Truck Drivin' Song"", which didn't really have a very funny premise anyway. Other than that, it's a pretty solid release, albeit a bit late."
5,Great Parodies!!,"This is awesome! I just finished listening to it and it rocked! The ""one Week"" parody, ""Jerry Springer"", was pretty funny. Same with Pretty Fly For a Rabbi and Your Horoscope Today. Albequerque is the longest, most piontless weird Al songs, but it's one of my favorites."
5,Among his best,"I found this to be Al's best album, musically speaking. The arrangements are tight, and the lyrics funny. On first listen, I didn't particularly like ""It's all about the Pentiums,"" mainly because I didn't know the original, but upon closer listening, it's become one of my favorites, mostly for the lyrics. Although Al claims to not know much about the internet, he nails modern computer-speak. The other songs have been described at length by others, so I'll close by saying that his polka medley is, once again, brilliant."
4,Love It,"Hey Saga begins is a more recognize song, especially to youngsters. They probably don't know Al has been around alot longer than they have been alive. I like the album but Al is losing his humor. The songs that makes me laugh is Jerry Springer, Your Horriscope For Today, Truck Diving Song and Albuquerque (I say A-a L-l B-b U-u ------- Querque-querque!)That's 4/12 songs. Normally Al gets a laugh in almost all his songs. But he's losing his touch. But what the heck, he's attracting young fans keeping his popularity up throughout years to come. I betcha he's going to make a comeback and have albums like Bad Hair Day which took the the charts for over 50 consecutive weeks. Keep up with the good work Al"
5,Hilarious,"A bit raunchier than some of Al's other albums (a few songs border on ""too raunchy"" for my taste), but this is one funny album. As others have noted, ""Albuquerque"" is the highlight, and, IMHO, is worth the price of the CD."
4,GroupHug Addict,"As I said, I am virtually addicted to the grouphug.us website, spending perhaps an average of 25 minutes a day there and having made perhaps a dozen confessions. I anxiously awaited the release of the book, and, while it was not a disappointment, it lacked some of the raw material and strange spelling and formatting that make the site so good. Also I had already seen many of the confessions in the book. The advantage of the book, especially to people unfamiliar with the website, is that it separates the chaff from the good, original confessions. I was also happy with the narrative that the author, Gabriel Jeffrey, proovided because it made the site more personal and I had long wondered about the identity of the creator."
5,A voyeristic treat,This book is an exciting ride of emotions. You tap into the secret lives of complete strangers. It's fun not even knowing their real name and yet you know their deepest darkest secrets...it could be written by someone you even know. :) How exciting! 5stars!
1,DID NOT GET TO PLAY IT !!!!!!!,THE COMPANY SENT ME A CRACKED GAME. NOT ONLY THAT THEY KNEW IT WAS CRACKED BECAUSE THE TAPED IT UP AND STILL SENT IT TO ME THAT WAS BAD BUSINESS GUYS. I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOWARD TO PLAYING THE GAME. AND THEY RUINED IT FOR ME.
2,Grand Theft Auto,"I play these games for the violence and not so much for the mission. The vehicle is hard to control and the graphics are okay for the original PS, but I wasn't impressed. I expected a little more out of it."
2,Grand Theft auto is interesting but simply outdated,"Grand Theft Auto has unlimited gameplay but did they ever think about improving the graphics? The graphics are horrobile. The options in the game are incredible though. I recomend this too anyone who doesnt care about the graphics, otherwise rent first, u'll be happy to find out what u were almost goin to buy."
5,"Not meant for kids, but lots of fun for adults","Grand Theft Auto is an interesting game, and, surprisingly difficult as well. While the language and violence of the game mean it should not be played by children (hence the M rating), adults should find it challenging and addictive.Answer phones around the city to get your assignments. These range from picking up your boss after a bank robbery, to getting revenge on members of another crime syndicate, to even blowing up a police station with a tanker truck. If you break too many laws, the cops will be after you, and you'll have to learn a couple tricks to get away clean.There are three cities available for play, and no structure to where you have to go. There's no path to follow, few time limits, and lots of freedom to just explore the city, drive around, and have fun."

1,Pure Insanity,"The author should be in a rubber room. Only in the context of religion could such madness be even listened to. If someone said anything as utterly preposterous, outside of the context of religion, as the authors claims of armageddon and salvation for only the chosen few, there would be teams of Psychiatrists using them as a test study."
4,"Nice, big toy box..","I was looking for a toy box that actually accomodates a bunch of toys. Very happy w/size. Sides and top made of plastic, middle section & bottom made of canvas. Not sure how I feel about the lid. It fits into place, not really attached. Nice looking. My 15 month old grandson cannot reach toys at bottom of toybox w/out climbing in. Oh well. Overall happy w/purchase."
1,tattered,This came all used and tattered. It was a gift for my dad but I never gave it to him. I gave it to Goodwill instead.
2,Flags of our Fathers,This was a disappointing book to me. It didn't have the character development needed for an engaging read and just didn't encourage me to keep turning the page.
2,"oK, just not ""Flyboys""","While I very much appreciate the content of this book, after reading ""Flyboys"" first, this was a little slow and not nearly as good for me."
4,Incredible Journey,"This book does a really great job of telling the story of Iwo Jima. Not only does it tell the story of the flag itself, but you get the background on the soldiers themselves along with the battles."
4,Errors in the research,"I enjoyed the book but it could have used better editing. On page 63, the author states that Bataan fell on Good Friday, April 3, 1942. This is incorrect, the Japanese opened their final offensive on Good Friday, but the troops on Bataan held on until April 9. The book does an amazing job of describing the hell on earth that Iwo Jima was. I could not image any thing like that and I spent 27 years in the Army."
4,most reflective book,"One of the great war story to come out of World War II, the tale of six men who rise the flag at Iwo Jima comes alive in this well told story. Unfortuately, its also a tale of saddness and disappointment as the toll of war made it mark on the survivors while it took the lives of others. I think one of the great tragedies of this book probably lies with the author's father, who strunk back when he should have spoken out during the long life that was blessed him. Men like him should be speaking since so many who were at Iwo Jima could not. But the book proves be reflective on the cost and toll of our soldiers in war, any war."
5,"Incredible, Learn the story behind the photograph","Flags of our fathers is a book that brings out strong emotions on mutiple levels. It provides great insight into an image that is recognized by many but understood by very few. The book explores the human costs of the battle of Iwo Jima in addition to the costs of that famous photograph on the men and their families. The brutality of that battle and of war are brought vividly to the forefront while evoking strong patriotic feelings at the same time. Once again, the ""Greatest Generation"" earns its name."
5,"common man, uncommon valor","with the exception of Joe Rosenthal's famous photo of Sgt. Mike Strank's Marines raising the second flag atop Mt. Suribachi, Iwo Jima was a forgotten pivotal battle in the island hopping campaign to Japan. this book is a grand reminder of the thankless sacrifices our Grandfathers, Fathers, Uncles, and Cousins made during the war. As a baby boomer, every father in my neighborhood served in WWII, and the Korean War. Yes, some were at Iwo Jima, Chosin Reservoir(Korea), Battle of the Bulge etc.. Like the author's father, they rarely spoke about it, and felt the real heroes never came back. This book is a poignant reminder of the courage, devotion to one's fellow soldier, and the tenacity required of our father's to win the war. this is a must read!"
5,"A must read, but it's an emotional ride...........","Perhaps the best book I've ever read. This book captures the action, the drama, the immense human sacrifices paid by the soldiers, their courage, the brutality of war, the history of the era and the war, the biographical background of the young soldiers and their families both before, during and after the war. Superb isn't strong enough to describe how well written this book is as it tells an amazing story about our young men who go off to war to save their country and the world from ruthless military dictatorships. The stories are gut wrenching and tear jerking. You will travel into the belly of the beast that is war and be nourished by the courage and committment to the mission's success and be emotionally devastated by the carnage and loss of life and limb that followed these poor souls 24/7. The men and women who fought in WW2 truly were American's greatest generation. Read this book."
5,A Must read for every Marine,"This book should be a must-read for every Marine who walks through the gates of Paris Island. There is more history about the Corps in this book than most of the ""war"" books about the Marine Corps on the shelfs of your library. This book really explains the ""simper fi"" attitude that Marines carry through their life. If you are a Marine, you will experience the ""why"" you feel like you do about the Corps. You will learn, cry and feel proud to be a part of the few, the proud. Semper Fi even sounds more important."
4,This is an important book...,"I knew nothing about the battles of the Pacific theater of World War II, so when I purchased this book I expected to learn a lot about the Battle of Iwo Jima and the men who raised the flag in the famous photograph. My expectations were completely fulfilled. The story of the Marines on Iwo Jima is horrendous and inspiring at the same time, and now I understand fully why Truman had to drop atomic bombs on Japan. Anyone who believes that atomic bombs were unnecessary needs to read this book. Everyone else, read it for knowledge of an important part of our past."
5,Getting It Right,"This is not a ""battle book"" (Ambrose quote on back dust jacket).This is a book about courage, commitment, the strength of human character, terrifying war and remembrance.And much, much more.To all wannabe authors: read this book. Learn from the author's mature vocabulary, his pursuit of meticulous detail, his tireless research and most importantly learn from his passion for his subject. James Bradley got it right. Thanks Jim. Keep the Faith."
5,A Moving Tribute,This book reshaped my understanding of the sacrifice that the generation of WW II made to preserve our liberty. John Bradley tells a stirring story of the six Marines that were captured in the famous flag raising photograph on Iwo Jima. A must read for anyone under the age of 70.
5,Flags of Our Fathers,This is one of the best books I have ever read. I enjoyed every word! It was difficult for me to put it down. If possible I would have read it without stopping. The detail of the fight for the island and the lives of the veterans was great.
5,A must read for any American,"Only the son of a Marine that fought at Iwo Jima could have gotten the veterans to talk about their horrific experiences 55 years after the battle. Part memoir, part history, and all very good. An incisive commentary about how fame and celebrity enveloped these young men for something they thought of no significance. John Bradley was right that the ""real heroes were those who didn't come back"" from Iwo Jima. But all of them were heroes who fought and only wanted to forget upon returning home. We can learn much from this men through this book."
5,To Mr. Bradley,"I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Bradley speak at a memeorial service for all the marines that served on Iwo. Not only was I impressed by the presentation, but the content and compassion he illustrated as a speaker was awesome. I purchased two copies of this book; I got one for my grandfather (2nd Lieutenant USMC)and one for myself. To Mr. Bradley... thank you and thank your father."
5,"Heroes, all.","I believe that if the entire population of the world were to read this book, there would never be another war. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" reveals the stories of simple, every day American boys who became men before their time in choosing to fight for our country. It tells of their loyalty, dedication and ultimately, their sacrifice. The men who fought in WWII claim that the only heroes were those who did not return. I believe all who served became heroes the day they signed up to fight for our freedom. In addition to the poignant stories, many of the myths that followed the famous flagraising image are dispelled and the truth is told by survivors of the battle of Iwo Jima. An easy read, written by the son of the only flagraiser to survive into old age."
4,Great Book,It's hard to get my 16 year old son to read. He liked the book so much he now wants the movie.
5,WWII,This book is a biography about those six men that raised a flag on Iwo Jima. Those men changed history in the making. A boy was looking for those long and gone heros after the Great War. This book really inspires people on how this battle began and ended. This tells the story on how these boys lived there lives after this great achievement. The event in history changed the way people have thought how we can make a change in the world like the atom bomb which stopped the war on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan
4,"The Lives and Stories behind the Icon, Uncommon Valor","This was a quick 2 week nightly read with photos galore (including a Japanese blockhouse), index and notes for each chapter. The book really fleshes out the movie with great details, though the movie hits one's emotions heavily throughout. Powerfully captures the many dimensions of the lives of the men and women behing the photo. While a great emphasis was placed on the photo and the action of raising the flag in the history books, the courage amidst multiple trials and hardships and the perseverence for love of God and country is the most significant aspect of this historical account. Such detail will NOT be found in school books."
5,A MUST BUY,This book is very touching! Reading the book gives you more emotion and detail into the lives of these brave men. Don't watch the movie! Read the book first. :-)
5,Remembrance,Have not as yet read the book myself. I bought it for a Christmas Gift for my husband who is a war vet that loves to read these types of events about true history. Also I read a great review about this book before I ordered.
4,"Dear Grandpa,","If there is only one reason to read this book it is the letter to Alison Bradley's grandpa, John Bradley. This book is 353 pages of great story and fact telling that bring Iwo Jima and the flag raisers to life. It was not until page 352 when I read Alison's letter to her deceased grandpa that the entire story comes together and you feel the heart of a man, a family, and a nation that raised a flag on Iwo Jima."
4,Great overall; weak ending.,"Good action book. I enjoyed the story of the battle itself, but Bradley seems to digress and rehash the same points over and over toward the end. I often found Bradley repeating himself or re-wording previous opinions, which made the last 1/4 of the book a little dull, but the first 3/4 is excellent and I highly suggest it to anyone. My first impression of James Bradley is that he seems to be a poor man's Stephen Ambrose. Can't wait to read his other book ""Flyboys."""
4,Well worth reading,"""Flags of Our Fathers"" is well worth reading, even if just to learn more about the incredible battle for Iwo Jima. What makes this book special is the extent to which Bradley focuses on the individuals involved in the famous flag raising on the top of Mt. Suribachi. Who were these men? Where did they come from? What did they think? These are the kinds of questions Bradley is asking. And I think he finds some good answers. Researching their childhoods and backgrounds, he puts a human face on these six Marines. This is what I desire to know when I read about World War II. I'm not so much interested in memorizing battle tactics or maneuvers. I want to know what people who experienced the war thought about it, then and now. Bradley catches the essence of these questions with this work."
2,Flags fo Our Fathers,"The book ""Flags of our Fathers"" by James Bradley is a book about the men at Iow Jima and the flag raisers. This book looks into their lives and the thoughts of what they thought about the pictures of them raising the flag. Everyone thought they were heroes except for them. They were dragged across the country on a scam to make people buy bonds form the government but they were against everything they were doing because all they wanted to do was go back to Iow Jima to fight with their friends. I would have enjoyed the book but the book was mostly about info there was not much of a story line that I could see. Other than that it was a good book to what I could see."
5,A sons tribute to his father,"This book is one of the best accounts of Iwo Jima that I have ever read. It tells the story as if you were there, and you feel almost sick to your stomach learning of how these poor marines were dying and yet they kept fighting on. It is about Iwo Jima but i believe it to be a tribute to John Bradley, the father of James Bradley the author. It tells the story of him and the other 5 flag raisers and what happened to them througout there lives. But to me this was the story of John and I felt that i connected with him from his earlier years as a boy through his corpsmen training throught the 7th bond collection tour. I understood John and why he never talked about his ordeal at Iwo Jima, the flag raising, and the navy cross he was awarded. If you have to read a book, read FLags of Our Fathers, its simply a great read."
4,The tragedy of war,"I felt like I was there. I could feel my eyes stinging and my heart pounding with every page describing the battles. These scenes were some of the best I've ever read. However, the book seemed to drag toward the end. Still, it was a proud book that honors the military that will make you want to salute all the veterens you know."
5,A Must read for our Children,"This is a fantastic book. As a former Marine and Nam Vet this does my heart good. James Bradley did a wonderful job capturing an important moment in history as few have before him. Our kids should all have to read this in school. Lest we forget an important part of our past. War isnt like the movies it is more like hell. And it has far reaching impacts in ones life, both positive and negative. This book captures it all. Great read and great job."
5,Has the attributes of a classic for future generations.,"After I read ""Flags of Our Fathers"", it was my feeling that this book was in the same genre as Stephen Crane's, ""The Red Badge of Courage"", but more complete. It brought back the bone rattling terror and horror of the battle. These images are still with me as fresh as yesterdays trip to the barbershop. Over 55 years ago, while squatting in a foxhole with my back to Suribachi, the marine in the next foxhole yelled, ""someone's put the flag up on the f.....g hill"". Sure enough there old glory was waving in the wind. We felt at the time that the battle would soon be over. Only the euphoria was over soon. The battle continued for another month. I found few errors in the book and they were of no consequence to the content of the storyline. For anyone who wishes to get the feel of combat and its terrible effects on the human psyche, this book will help in that understanding."
5,Brings tears to my eyes,"This book is a must read for everyone. As a US Marine, I am a little biased, but everyone should understand what the marines went through. The site and meaning of the Iwo Jima memorial should mean something to everyone as it does me. This book will give you a great description of the hard times and triumph these marines endured. Great read around Memorial Day. We owe our veterans, now learn why."
5,Disturbing and Beatiful,"Wow. What a book. I can't fathom what the Marines went through in the Pacific Theater, but this book helps me to understand it better than I ever thought I would - and I believe I now understand it as well as I ever care to. I don't think I have the mettle to face what these men faced, and my respect and thankfulness for their sacrifice is now with me forever. Thanks, Mr. Bradley."
5,A MUST READ!!!!!,"This is an awesome book. It had me glued from page one. If you don't read any other book this year, make sure that this is the one. I can only hope that a movie will follow for these amazing men and all of the other people that fought and died for our country. We owe them and this book is a fitting tribute to them. I only wish that this would have been written earlier. KUDO's to you."
4,"Very Poignant , Haunting and Thought-Provoking!","While I don't read a lot of non-fiction, Flags Of Our Fathers is a book that was difficult for me to put down. The author's ability to describe in such a poignant and haunting manner the lives of the six men attributed with raising the flag on Iwo Jima before, during and after the event left me spellbound. Further, it made me once again appreciate a generation of Americans that Tom Brokaw refers to as the ""greatest generation."" Flags Of Our Fathers should be read by all Americans, and especially the younger generations, who have an interest in understanding the terror of war and the impact it has on those lucky enough to survive it."
3,"Good subject and story, but poorly written...","Liked the content and the story, but the writing, chalk full of cheap hyperbole, read like a USA Today."
2,A little flat...but ok,"A nice 'insider edition' to the lives of those men forever captured in the most celebrated memorial of WWII, the Iwo Jima flag raising. Nothing, however most grade school kids didn't know 50 yrs ago."
1,Boring!,"I had to read this book for an Honors English class, and it was horribly boring! Yes, the information provided is accurate, but Bradly wrote it in such a way that it was just a pain in the behind to read."
4,and 1/2 stars The story behind the photograph,"James Bradley has written an excellent book about the lives of the six flagraisers in the most famous photograph of all time. I thought this was very well done, in most books you get a general overview of the story or the story as one person perceived it. In this book you find out the history of all six people from the day they were born until the present day. Some would be dead a day or two after the photo was taken.James Bradley's father was the figure in the center of the photograph - his father never wanted to talk about Iwo Jima & felt the real heroes were the ones who died on Iwo Jima. I learned a lot from reading this book. A movie based on the book & directed by Clint Eastwood is coming out later this summer. I think this story should transfer well to the big screen."
4,How could anyone reject this book??????,"To the publishers who rejected this book HAHAHAHA you rejected a wonderful story of bravery,sacrifice,heroism,family and love of country. The flag raisers were from all over the country and were representative of this nation. It also shows the bravery of the Marines, and why they,along with the corpsmen are so highly regarded. For a modern example of Marine Heroism read The Gift of Valor."
4,AWESOME STORY,boorish at times but great historical event and story about men who truly loved their country.
5,One of my very favorites,"I couldn't recommend this book enough to any one who loves history. I felt as if I was there. The author did a fantastic job of painting a complete picture, giving me and anyone who reads this book a much better understanding of what happened."
5,"Two words: Inspiring, Realistic","As the title indicates, this book was the most inspiring and realistic book I have ever read. Every member of my family read it, males and females both, and all of them loved it as well. The book perfectly captures the exact feeling of the battle through detailed examples and eloquent language. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to reconfirm his or her belief that the human spirit can prevail."
5,Must Read,"The book is very touching, you feel that you know these young men and their families. It helps us to see the price many paid so we can live the lives we do. It was trully a Great Generation, we may feel times or bad or that things are rough but most of us will not see in a life time the things these young men experienced in a few hours or days. How many of us would travel 2600 miles to set a story straight about a friend? Could we measure up!"
5,Loved this book!,"I saw the movie when it first came out and was not too impressed with it. A friend began reading the book and was telling me about it, so I decided to buy it for myself. I loved this book! It was truely amazing and I would rate it as one of the top 5 books I've ever read."
3,Iwo Jima,"This was a very good book, but there could have been many more facts shared. This was a historical book and I found it to be very interesting."
2,It fell apart,"Received this book quickly. It was new and appeared in perfect condition, but as soon as my son started reading it big sections of pages began falling out from the binding - almost like the glue was old. He was able to read it in sections and get through the required reading for school, but definitely not an ideal way to read a book."
3,Bradley's son betrays DAd,"Over and over Bradley tells us that his father was reluctant to talk about this. What would his Dad think about his incessant chattering. Half the book is statements like ""..and yet Dad never talked about it,"" or ""when reporters called he would turn them away"" Bradley is just profiteering from what his Dad did not want-publicity."
2,"Too many flashbacks, disjointed","The book is far better than this Eastwood CD. The book is more complete, and more comprehensive in the story of this vicious bloody battle and the men who fought and died there. The movie has far too many flashbacks(and sometimes flashbacks within flashbacks) and seems to focus more on the lives of the 3 surviving flag raisers than the battle itself and all the brave US Marines and sailors who died there. The movie is often hard to follow and I can only assume the viewer is supposed to know what the actor is thinking at times without the benefit of dialogue, but I couldn't and I read the book.I would not buy this CD knowing what I know now, but I highly recommend the book by James Bradley. His is the real story."
2,WW II book,"Did not think this book was on par with ""Flags of Our Fathers"" about Iwo Jima. ""Flyboys"" seemed to drag on and on."
5,Casual viewer,Best book I've ever read. Weren't we great back then. What happened to us? Bought Blue Ray. It was awful.
5,Flag's,"After this book is read please donate it to your local high school library, this history must be remembered. Better yet, keep your edition and buy another for the school. Every school library in America should have this important volume."
5,One of the Best War books ever written!,"Great,great book! I felt like I was on that island 55 years ago the way it was discribed by Bradley.A must read for anyone who wants to feel how it was like to invade an island while being fired upon by an unseen enemy who would not give up. This book is special to me as my father served in the Seebees and was on Iwo Jima building airfields for our planes en route to bombing runs over Japan. Thanks Mister Bradley on a job well done!"
5,"Informative, interesting, entertaining, and heart wrenching",I thought this was a wonderful book -- thanks so much to Mr. Bradley and Mr. Powers for all their efforts in putting it together. I loved it. I think it should be required reading for all Americans.
5,Wonderful story of humility,"I was very surprised after reading this book to learn that the flagraising on Mt. Suribachi in Iwo Jima was nothing more than a simple replacement flag implant. These six men were brought together from all parts of the country, assigned to Iwo Jima along with thousands of other young American men and women, and by sheer circumstance, helped one another replace a crippled original flag on top of the mountain. A photographer happened to snap a shot of the flagraising, and instantly became a national symbol of courage and eventually the monument of The Marine Corps Memorial. The book is filled with clear images of life for a World War II soldier (Pacific Theater), strength, love, friendship, humility, fear, courage, and extreme struggle. I recommend this book to every American citizen."
5,Powerful!,"I thought this was an excellent book. It was the first book I had ever read on Iwo Jima and I never knew anything about these six flag raisers. These were men who were glorified because of a single picture of the American flag being planted atop Mount Suribachi and hardly recognized or remembered because of the amazing bravery and courage they displayed in 36 days of fighting at Iwo Jima. Planting the flag was hardly a heroic act, they were just doing what they were told and a photographer just happened to catch that momement in time. The Picture, as it came to be known, proved to be a symbol of American tenacity and heroism and ironically, a nightmare to the three surviving flag raisers.At times savage, heartfelt and always powerful, Flags of our Fathers is a must read for everyone."
5,Life Changing,"This is the only book that I have ever read that left me stunned (and that's saying something). As a Generation X'er, I read this in May of 2000, before 9/11, before the War on Terror, before Iraq, and I thought - ""We have no idea..."" (Unfortunately, that thought turned out to be somewhat prophetic) I had always had respect for Vets, but that respect is so much deeper, and much more meaningful for having read this book. I cry when I see the flag raised now. I feel my heart swell at Veteran's Day events. You will not be the same for the experience."
3,Wrong book,"It was not the book I thought was ordered. It was a student version which I didn't want. It is a good book otherwise, was delivered on time with no issues"
5,George & Mary Rock!,"I love this song! It truly rocks..I never thought those two voices would blend together, but it works wonderfully!"
3,alright song even better without Mary J.Blige,"i got this song mainly because George Michael was on it.I dig His Cover Version Of Stevie Wonder's ""They Won't Go When I Go"",from His ""Listen Without Prejudice"",album.Babyface does a cool job on Production but this is by no means as great as the Original.the Original Sounds amazing to this day.George Michael can still sing.Mary J.Blige wrecks this song.I wish George Michael could have sung this with Deniece Williams somebody who use to sing with Stevie WOnder&who can carry a tune unlike Blige.it would have been so much better."
3,Not his strongest book,"""Lead to Succeed"" suffers from the same problem that many leadership books do. Leadership is a combination of an individual in a context, and many of Pitino's examples either don't translate well from coaching to business, or then end up being very generic (""be flexible"" - gee, thanks, never though of that ;-)) The other problem is that Coach Pitino uses examples of his principles in his leadership of the Boston Celtics - but his tenure with the Celtics was not a success. He's a great coach, but I think his experience proves that effective leadership is context based. He was great at UK, poor with the Celtics, great at UL, etc.I absolutely loved his earlier book ""Success is a Choice"" which translates very well into business. I'd recommend the earlier book more than this one."
2,Lead to succeed-10 great traits of freat leaders,"I just finished Lead to Succeed this a.m and I'm back at amazon to order 3 more for my key employees. This book had common sense ideas that can be related to any business in the growth mode. I'm not a big basketball fan, but I certainly am a fan of the wisdom of Mr. Pitino. The book was a wealth of knowledge and information,very entertaining and a book that I could not put down till I finished. Pass it on, it will encourage anyone to strive to become the best."
3,Not overly impressed,"This is not one of Pitino's greatest efforts. As a leadership book, it lacks a certain bit of inspiration that is key to a good leadership guide. He uses many of his experiences in coaching in the NCAA and NBA as how leadership can be applied to business and life. Overall, a decent book, but for inspiration and guidance there are better choices out there."
2,Lead to Succeed: 10 Traits of Great Leadershipin Business and Life,It is not what I was expecting after seeing an interview about the author in Fox. Maybe for high school students could be great.
1,Save your money,"This book is a waste of money and time.I expected better and more for my money.Everyone should expect more! The ideas and beliefs set forth are basically common sense.This isn't rocket science. Having Rick Pitino write or contribute to a book about leadearship and succeeding is a joke, an offensive one. This man has had only one real success in his life (The Kentucky basketball team) beyond that what has he done? Nothing! He's taken jobs and made money off of some people's belief that because of his one success he could repeat that. He has yet to prove himself. His leadership qualities have not been proven either. He has not been able to lead any of the people charged to him to success, nor has he been able to change their bad attitudes or instill a work ethic in them. He has not been able to pull anything from them to help or cause them to achieve any kind of real or lasting success. He cannot lead or succeed."
1,Pathological Egomaniac Into Jefferson County,"A perfect selection to augment the University of Louisville Library system-wide single book collection ""Dumb and Dumber: Get Down Dumb"". Also highly recomended on advanced review, Pitino's forethcoming ""The Red Headed Stepchild University That Just Quite Couldn't"""
3,Missing Pages!,"Just got this book Oct 09 and was so disappointed when I opened it, and noticed a printing error! It is missing pages 33-48, and instead has duplicates of 49-64. End result: you don't get Chief or Goodbye."
5,Excelente conditions,I received the book in excelents conditions and on time.For sure I will ask for another book in the future...
5,A Prayer Book Unlike Any Other,This a book of answered prayers that expounds the very mysteries of how a pray becomes successful. Anyone who has been captured by Autobiography of Yogi must make this part of their library.
5,A Masterpiece of Mystic Poetry,"This is a beautiful book, filled with poems that not only touch the heartstrings, but uplift and expand the spirit. In the West we've had some great mystic poets (St. John of the Cross, et al), but in my opinion, these verses surpass in beauty and inspiration anything of their kind written to date.While reading Whispers one can sense that Yogananda was a great lover of God. As one continues to read, one feels the author's mood overcoming one's own. It steals over and enthralls you, drowning out the noisy world with the power of inner rapture and silence.Whether or not you are of devotional temperament, if you love beauty and goodness, you would appreciate this book.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]"
1,Wrong Version,"It's hard to find the ""real"" version of this book. I thought this was it when I ordered it, but now I believe it is not. The test is to read the first line of ""Prayer at Noon"". If that sentence contains the word ""Zenith"" then you are not reading the ""real"" book but a rather a heavily editted rewritten version."
1,An Inferior Copy,Don't waste your money on this inferior copy of a spiritual masterpiece. I recommend the original version published by Self Realization Fellowship.
1,Not Original Whispers,"Be aware that this version of Whispers from Eternity is significantly edited by ""Swami Kriyananda"". Best published version in my opinion is the First Version - 1929 facsimile - or the current version available from Self-Realization Fellowship.Whispers From Eternity"
3,Creepy and disturbing horror game,"Suprisingly scary, extremely gory, terrible play control. That's ""Creatures"" in a nut-shell. It is to my understanding that this game came out for Playstation before the N64. Maybe it needed more development time to enhance the creepy graphics. Or mabye it was to add more creature sounds you here in the distance. Well, whatever it was, it sure wasn't play control. Sudden camera angle changes make the controls hard to manage and frustrating. But I'm guessing it WAS the graphics because they are better than great, suprisingly. What makes the game so scary are when monsters suddenly pop out of no where and make you jump. It's also the tense music and creature sounds that are heard right before the monsters jump out of nowhere. Not for the squeamish.Here are the key elements that make a game good: (Out of 10)Scares: 9Suspense: 8Graphics: 9Game Design: 7Play Control: 5Satisfaction: 7Sound: 10"
4,very creepy!,"This game i think could have been great if the controls were a bit more easy to use. The plot of the story is good but trying to kill small creatures can be a bit difficult. I never played this game when it first came out, but now i see why lol."
