2,Doesn't work with all printers or OS's.,The WL-520GU does not work with all printers or with windows 7. No where on the product description does it state it is a limited print server.
1,FRAUD,THIS WAS NOT A NEW PRODUCT I RECIEVED...PROBABLY A RETURN...BUYERS BEWARE...HAD TO RE-PROGRAM THE THIRD PARTY FIRMWARE...I DID NOT GET WHAT THIS MERCHANT PROMISED
3,"USB issues, alternative firmware","If you're planning on using this device with alternative firmware, be aware that this model (wl-520gu) has known USB port issues. It's unclear if the problem is hardware or software. Depending on what you want to do, you may or may not encounter problems; for example, printing and usb disk access seem to work for most folks, but I could not get my USB 3G/EVDO aircard working for an internet connection. I tried various versions of openwrt, dd-wrt, and koppel(USB 3G enabled firmware based on ASUS source), with similar results. Info about the USB issue(s) can be found via your favorite search engine.If you're planning on using the router for printing, be sure to make sure your printer is supported on the Asus site. It does raw pass-through printing - there is no queue (not cups based). Giving this 3 stars because it seems pretty decent as a wi-fi router otherwise."
3,"Reliable product, slow speed.","I always liked ASUS products and this one didn't fail me as well. Good connection and reliability. The only serious concern for me was the speed. No matter what I did, even after flashing the product with DD-WRT the speed would rarely be higher than 10Mbit.It should be noted that I have different wi-fi products connecting to this router.I returned this router and got ASUS RT-N12 which always keeps 40Mbit.If speed is not a concern you can definitely get this one (you can even attach printer to it to be printed wirelessly) but for high speeds this item need to be avoided."
3,More on Global Warming and Less on Tourism Than Desired,"We were planning a vacation to Glacier this summer so I purchased this video thinking it would be more of a tourist information production, showing the best places to see, to camp, to visit etc. In fact, the general theme of this entire production is that global warming is destroying the glaciers in the park. That may or may not be, I am not a scientist, but the video did not deliver the information I had hoped for.There was a good deal of footage around the park, much of it from a helicopter. Indeed, the park is magnificent and we got to see some of the beautiful spots, but instead of the narration saying ""here is beautiful Lake McDonald"" and here is how to get there, the footage is shown while the narration bemoans global warming. So many of the beautiful vistas we witnessed remain unknown locations, places we hope to find. But we will need other references to effectively plan our trip."
5,Love and Lost,I love this show and they cut it too short. I wish that we knew what happened. Don't end on a twist!
1,Mini means mini,No dimensions for this item in the description so beware. The case is 1 inch by 1 and 1/2 inches. Each crayon is one inch long.
5,Awesome,Little need to be said about this item because I think everybody likes NCIS. Good price and received the item very quick. If u haven't ever watched this show give it a try!!
4,NCIS: Seasons 1-8,"Product is great. All new? Into season 3, so far, only found one fault, 2 of the discs in Season 1 were mislabeled. But we figured it out and switched them around (not the labels the discs in the box)and watched them in order. For the price, not complaining. Don't know if it is a manufacturing glitch. . . or what. Overall was happy with product, vendor and Amazon."
3,DVD's are missing. .,"I love this show. The DVD's came quickly and we have enjoyed watching them. Unfortunately, after the three month return window closed, we opened season seven to find that four DVD's are missing. Please check that ALL disc's are there before you have this same problem."
2,Messed up dvds,Season five of this set is missing 4 episodes. Dvds are labeled correctly but they don't have the shows that are listed on them. Season one didn't have disc 5 correct. It was the same as disc 4 but with a disc 5 label. Not finished with the series yet. Hope I don't find anymore mistakes.
2,discs skip,"I bought this product for $160 so I was expecting it to work, however discs six through eight all skip. I can't return the product so basically I wasted $160. I'm pretty mad about it and prolly wont order from Amazon again."
1,NCSI 1-8 seasons,"After receiving this product and went to watch them they are made about as cheap as they can be made. I have only tried to view season one. The disc first comes on with subtitle in Chinese. After I got the subtitle turned off. Started watching the show the screen becomes pixilated, can't understand what the people are saying. The disc skips,stalls and moves on the the next show. I have changed out my DVD player to one just out of the box and it does the same thing. one of the discs has the wrong titles on the disc cover. All the discs in season 1 did the same thing so I tried the first disc in season 2 and it does the same thing. If I knew before I ordered these I would not of bought them. These were not worth the price I paid in fact they are not worth having even if someone gave them to you."
3,NCIS Seasons 1-8,"Was happy with the product at 1st glance. One Episode of Season 1 was missing. Wasn't too concerned. However, 1st disc of Season 4 was unplayable, skipping, audio missing, incomplete episodes that stopped in the middle. The next disc was fine, but I'm beginning to wonder what lies ahead on the others. I'm sorry I didn't buy this from a store so that I could easily return unplayable/missing discs."
3,NCIS The Complete Season Review,This is a really good buy. I have a few discs that skip when you watch the episodes. I am still waiting til I completely watch all of the seasons before I let them know what is going on with my purchase. The quality of the disc is really good. I would recommend other people buying this product. They are good with shipping it to you. It was shipped to me earlier than what they told me it would take.
3,Missing,I missed the episode where they withheld exculpatory information in order to help convict Marines of a non-existent war crime. See Haditha.
4,NCIS seasons 1-8,"This is a Christmas gift, but my husband enjoys the show on TV, so I know that he will enjoy watching the DVD set."
2,Poor quality knock off of a series that I love.,"Was REALLY disappointed!. Love the NCIS series and was thrilled to find them for less than $29.00 a season. Unfortunately, my find falls into the ""if it seems to good to be true"" category - because it definitely was NOT a good deal. I received poor quality knock off's. The CD covers are faded and low quality, almost looking like glossy copies. Some discs have digital pixelization and breaks in sound. And others don't allow you to access all the special features. Would definitely not buy from this vendor again!!! Shame on Amazon for bringing them up as a reputable supplier in their search results."
4,NCIS Nirvana,"I enjoy NCIS, but my wife and daughter are addicted! I purchased the complete series as a birthday gift, and I have made them very happy. They have been able to find episodes that they haven't seen before, even on ""marathon weekends"". By watching some of the earlier episodes, things that happen later in the series make more sense. In addition, purchasing the DVD set has freed up a lot of space on our DVR, which was previously programmed to record every episode that aired on cable! If you are a dedicated NCIS fan, this set is definitely for you."
1,Great series - beware of bootlegs,"I ordered the 1-8 set through a non-Amazon seller. These were advertised as in new condition, but upon arrival, it was clear these were knock-offs. The print quality of the dvd packaging and insert was poor, like as from a 15 year old inkjet printer on draft mode. The discs themselves appeared to all be factory pressed with silkscreen/full color printing/artwork. However, the episodes/content of the discs were remastered to fit (lessened quality) on a single DVD layer AND to include 'engrish' and Chinese subtitles. I verified the remastering by ordering a disc through Netflix to check contents...no Chinese subtitles and dual layer DVD.I reported this to AMAZON and contacted the seller for a full refund. It's a fantastic series, but just make sure you are getting these through a legitimate party to ensure you are getting what you are paying for and that you don't have any of the playback issues reported by other users."
1,Not all the discs will play,"This looked like a good deal but some of the discs won't play. Tried on a 3 different DVD players but the discs that would not play in one player still wouldn't work in another player. I am very disappointed with this box set. Some of the quality in the first few seasons are poor....they look like analog, but then another episode after will look good...then another bad one so it wasn't the filming of the show."
4,great customer service,"I absolutely love this product. I am even more impressed with this company. When I noticed some problems with a few of the discs and notified them, the response was immediate and helpful. I was given the time needed to check all of the discs. Once I identified the few that were bad I sent an email. I received the replacement discs in about a week. There was also a hand written note of apology. I would order from this company again anytime. This is the type of customer service not found often in today's hurried market place. Thank you for remembering what customer service is all about!"
1,Season 1 messed up. A real PAIN,Update to this review. I really hope people are receiving a better product than I received. We have been playing them on a HD tv. The quality is not very good at all. We have tried them on both of our HD sets and they they look really bad. We even compared to an episode that was running at the same time on Directtv.I would not purchase these again. Not sure what is going on but the ones we got were terrible.sorry. I really Love NCIS. Maybe someone knows where I might get them in Blueray. I have looked but havebeen unable to find a blue ray version.
3,forced adventure,"I enjoyed the book, though I had some problems with it. These had nothing to do with Jenkins' writing, which was superb. Rather, the whole ""adventure"" he writes about seems to have been orchestrated simply so that he could write a book about it. Unlike ""A Walk Across America"" which was written as an afterthought (since he planned his walk for its own sake, not because he wanted to write about it), ""Along the Edge"" seems a bit forced. Though he gives reasons for wanting to check out the coast, we can see that he was just looking for a unique adventure that he could write about.Yes, I agree that this is what he does for a living, and why shouldn't he seek out another adventure? But this one lacked the magic of his other adventures. That said, most of the people he met in this book have fascinating stories to tell. The book is definitely worth reading--even if it takes some 80 pages of describing his preparations and training before he actually sets off."
3,Not nearly as good as A Walk Across America,"In his book describing his walk across many eastern states Jenkins does an excellent job of describing the scenery and people he encounters. You really feel that he bonds with those he meets.The boat trip described in this book seems much less interesting - mostly because it seems so forced. It seems that Jenkins looks back fondly on his long walk and wants nothing more than to recreate it - this time on a boat. The trouble is, an adventure like his walk is impossible to recreate.A Walk Across America was written after the fact. His adventuresome spirit led him to many intriguing places and he only thought to write about it after it was over. In this book however, Jenkins seems to be on a hunt for interesting folks to include in a new book.Sometimes he succeeds in finding interesting people (a Vietnam vet and his brother, a Texas sheriff) but more often than not the people he describes were a bit eccentric but really not worth writing about in a book."
3,A Great Ending to a Sad Start...,"Having read 5 or 6 of Jenkin's other books, I realized at once that the man writing this was not the same author I had come to admire, but rather one who was hurt and needed to heal his soul following the collapse of his marriage. The book started out slow and sad, but as Peter's confidence re-emerged and his passion for exploring new places burned bright again, this book became more and more fun and interesting. His style returned to the easy-to-read prose I had so enjoyed in his previous books. To ""see"" a person's soul heal through his writing like this was like watching a flower open. And to ""meet"" the new friends he made along the way sure got my travel itch going! (Welcome Back, Peter! I missed your work and want you to know that you have positively influenced many of the young people I work with. I have given your books to several and they are all impressed with your love of life and your willingness to take risks that enrich your soul. Thanks!)"
4,A fun read!,"I must admit that I didn't like this one as much as his first, it was still a WONDERFUL book. I rate them the same. It is great having an author who is intimate enough with you to show you his fears and inhibitions. Keeping with his past books, he lets you meet increadible people he meets on the open waters. He brings along many people (friends AND family). And he shows you yet another good use for WD-40. I encourage you to get this one, just for fun's sake."
2,What a long sad journey this has been...,"Most people who go through midlife crisis stay up late for a few weeks and brood. After that, we count our blessings and move on. Not Jenkins. In this sad book, we see a man who has refused to grow up and has stayed self absorbed. The ruins of his marriage are worth the next adventure. Pitiful."
5,A good buy,"I have set up this pump as part of a circulation system in a 200 gallon tank, it is submersed in about 3 feet of water and is pumping water through a 3/4 inch hose to the top of a bucket filter. The distance from the bottom of the tank to the top of the bucket is 6 feet. This pump is working well so far with my system, powerful, great output and good price. It comes with a few adapters, one of which has a valve so the flow can be throttled and controlled. The only con for me is I the cord could have been longer, it is about 6 feet, but nothing an extension cord cant fix..."
4,Good if you care more about the economics than the math...,"I have to agree with the other reviewer, this is a fantastic book. It explains very clearly how powerful a tool linear programming can be in economics. However, this book really ties its hands by only talking about matrices or any of the mathematical reasons why linear programming works as it does in an appendix. If you're a mathematician that wants to learn about linear programming, this is definitely not the book. But if you're an economist, or just someone interested in economics, that wants to learn about linear programming, then this book is definitely for you. It is very rich with economic ideas and covers a lot of interesting topics such as growth theory and welfare economics."
5,Perfect!,I use these to fill lip gloss tubes. They work like a charm and stand up to higher temps without melting.
5,thoughtful and unpretentious,"A senstive look at the daily lives, joys and worries that shape rural communities in northern Pakistan. Jamie does not pretend to write a scholarly analysis of political developments, customs or beliefs. Instead she depicts attitudes and actions of everyday citizens, thus helping readers both understand and break down stereotypes. Jamie has a gift for painting pictures - of sights, people and situations - with words."
3,"Interesting, a bit judgmental","The book was somewhat slow, but overall an interesting read. I felt there was an underlying orientalist bent towards women, even though it seems that the author's intention is to be as objective as possible. As another reviewer mentioned, it is important to remember this book describes a small subset of people in Pakistan.It is also interesting to note that the book was republished after 9/11, due to a surge of interest in learning about Islam and Muslims. I don't think it's a good book to read if that is your intention - there is the danger of extrapolating what you learn from this book to all Muslims. But I would recommend it to those who are already familiar with the region (Pakistan) or the religion, as it is likely to give you a new insight into the tremendous diversity within the Muslim community."
5,Great Pan,"Copper is expensive. This pan, along with all of the Mauviel M'Heritage is solid copper, therefore it is expensive. Keep in mind this pan is 16"" and you won't be able to properly execute a paella on your home cooktop. You may want to consider an LP Paella burner or other outdoor large cooking surface to do justice to this amazing pan. The mirror finish they put on this is absolutely incredible, I couldn't wait to bury in embers as soon as I opened the box."
1,outrageous price,"This item sells for half the price at Smart & Final, or order them directly from the Jarden Corporation, which is the manufacturer."
1,Disappointed,"We ordered these jars after reading the reviews, but we were disappointed with the quality. We were trying to can apple butter and in total 5 of the 12 jars broke in the canning process! We did everything according to the instructions and the way we have canned in the past, yet still the bottoms of 5 jars broke off. We were so annoyed because the apple butter was a two-day process to make. So disappointed in this product and feel like it wasted our time, not to mention that we lost so much of our preserve. Will not order these again."
5,Kerr canning jars.,These jars are eight ounces each and they sealed real well right after filling them with homemade jam. They also have a real nice design on the glass.
3,"Good, sturdy, ugly jars","The jars arrived carefully packed, no dint, no crack anywhere. I washed them, filled them with marmelade and boiled them. All of the jars behaved perfectly, not a single one broke. I would have been over-pleased and over-joyed with the jars if I had used them for myself only; since I gave them away as Christmas gifts I wish I had picked a different design - the jars I bought were simply ugly, and the big 'Kerr' logo didn't help.My advice: if you want to give them as gifts, go for the kilted design, if not, it doen't matter, Kerr are high quality jars anyways."
2,First review correct-more info,Takes 55 minutes to get from room temperature to 48 degrees(according to light on the unit) which is really 58 in this reality matrix. Disappointing!Unit is being returned.
4,one more marine,"The main attraction of this book is the heroine, female working as a mechanic. Then comes this hero, guy like John Wayne, with his don't-touch-my-car attitude. And sizzling is ready. I liked this one much more than two previous books by Mrs. Child. I think this one was quite a good example of the genre. The marines are good characters as heros, beacause they have so black and white attitudes. Discipline above all and so on. I found this one worth the price I had to pay receiving it to Finland."
5,A Great Read!,"I enjoyed this book and I fell in love with the characters. Marie is a strong female lead and I enjoyed reading about how she thrives as a mechanic and owner of her own repair shop. Davis shares a love for repairing cars and I liked how this linked the characters, giving them something in common besides just the typical attraction. This book was a page turner and at the end I was left wanting their story to continue."
2,reads well but...,"I am a foreigner and I have been using romance fiction to improve my english for years... well, this excuse sounds better than my admitting I am an incurable romantic. The more I read, the more eclectic I become. Marine under the Mistletoe by Maureen Child left me with the feeling there was something left unsaid, something lacking from the description of the two heroes and of the events which brought them together and kept them together. There was not enough analysis or, if you do not like this clinical word, description of the emotions and of the story line. I usually rate books by my personal put-down factor. If a book is hard to put down at the end of the day and I want to read just one more page... If, on the other hand, I have no problem leaving the two heroes up to their own devices for the duration of my sleep... I left Davis and Marie up to their own devices for 36 continuous hours. But then again, this is only my opinion... You may enjoy it far more than I did."
3,Bachelor Battalion Christmas Special (grr...),The woman is at it again. *PLEASE.* I just got kicked out of Parris Friggin' Island for cripes sakes...
1,Book Review,The book is torn apart and will have to be sent to a book delaer for binding before it can be used.
4,Bought for a class,"I purchased this book for a class and got it very quickly! The book and CD-rom were in great shape overall; however this was a used book and they certainly let you know that with ""used"" stickers all over the cover. Including a giant one that just about covered the entire front of the book. If not for that I would have rated it five stars"
2,Mz.Will,The cover ras torn whrn the book arrived. But all of the information was in the book. The torn cover is an efesore.
1,Disappointing,"I read this text book as an requirement for a 6 month survey of the New Testament and I must say that this book did not meet my expectations. Gives a lot of good content but fails to back up its on claims with any solid support. For example, when stating a secular viewpoint on a particular topic within the book it would say that evidence indicates that this [secular] viewpoint is wrong and then it would fail to give reasons, opinions, evidence (!) why not.Gives content, outlines, pictures, maybe a few illustrations, but fails to defend the important claims of the Bible. Would not recommend this book to anybody."
4,Simple but Thorough,"I found this to be a very nice overview of the New Testament. It contains many photographs, maps, and other visuals that break up the text. This was the required textbook for my graduate NT Survey class, but I would consider it more appropriate for undergrad or even high school. If you are looking for something meaty, I would say this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a pleasant, sweeping survey of the NT, then you will likely enjoy this book."
5,Excellent book for anyone going into the ministry field,"If you are interested in diving into the true Biblical research of the New Testament, and to get a great view on the critical scholars view points for your congrigations' or Sunday schools' questions this is a great book worthy of your purchase. I used this book in my Neew Testamentsurvey class in my Bible College, Trinity College in Nerw Port Richey, Florida. Which is a outstanding school for your Biblical studies before seminary."
2,Doesn't smell at all like fresh cut grass,"This candle smells nothing like fresh cut grass. In case perhaps my sense of smell was off, I asked several others and no one thought that it smelled like fresh cut grass. It has a perfume-y smell. Very disappointed in this purchase."
2,Doesn't smell like grass at all.,"The candle has a pleasant scent, but it is perfumy and not at all like cut grass. No one who I've shared it with think so either. So, it's not worth it at all if you want something that smells like cut grass."
5,Great Reference Book for Athletic Trianers,I highly recommend this book if you are looking for an easy reference guide. It has all of the important information that an Athletic Trainer would need. It is easy to find the information that you are looking for. Great book.
3,Tina Moore,"""Never Gonna Let You Go"" was actually one of my favorite soul songs of the 90's and a modest hit for this talented young lady, and with good reason; it's a tight, catchy little tune which emanates rays of joyful abandon and young love, with a hook that just won't quit. But cute hooks alone do not an impressive LP make. While Moore is a fine young vocalist, there's nothing particularly distinctive about her sound or this album. I still own it and listen to it from time to time, but it isn't quite 'essential' in my book just yet. Her faithful reading of ""At Last"" is a nice attempt at diversity but it ultimately comes across as too rehearsed and mannered to conjure any true passion, but nice try. Overall, this LP is far from bad, it's just not very noteworthy."
4,Get this book,I used to work as a waitress at the Bakery Lane Soup Bowl when I was in college. The soup and bread and desserts were great then. And with the help of this book you can keep these wonderfully homey dishes alive years after the restaurant has passed on!
4,"Yummy!, Challenging! and Fun!",I came by this cookbook by way of a patient giving it away because she no longer cooked. Since I am an avid cook I gladly accepted it. The recipes have an old East Coast flavor. My 2 favorite recipes are: Shaker Chicken and Noodle Soup and Fresh Apple cake with Caramel Frosting which I just finished icing today.
5,Bakery Lane Soup Bowl,"Shortly after I moved to Prescott, AZ in 1976, a new restaurant opened on Whiskey Row. It was called ""Maude's"", after the owner's cat. The owners were Joan Sedgwick and Marge Mitchell. The food was extraordinary; bread, soup, desserts, sandwiches, occasional Sunday brunch; all wonderful. After many years (?), Joan and Marge moved to Jerome, AZ, a charming old copper mining town about 25 miles from Prescott, and opened another restaurant. I had their cook book for years, and I fear that I loaned it to someone who loved and enjoyed it as much as I, since I no longer have the book. Of course I would love to replace the book, but can anyone tell me why this cook book is listed in the hundreds of dollars? Thanks!. . .Marcie"
5,Stays in your mind,"I have read this book many times. I got it as a present, and the first time I read it in the plane it touched me deeply. Since that time I read it every now and then. It describes very well how I feel about the values in life and it is a wonderful written book with great illustrations. I have bought a great number of this book and give it as a special presents to people I care for, and to make them understand what makes my heart tick. Ton Thole, Loenen a/d Vecht. Holland"
5,Awesome book!,Great book! I read this one a long time ago when I was still studying abroad and it truly helped me overcome some really heavy issues regarding on what to do with my life. Now I have the life I've always wanted thanks to those words that gave me the nudge I so desperately needed.
4,poignant and simple,"like jonathon livingston seagull, this is a moving tale that can be easily adapted and interpreted in many different ways"
2,Jonathan Livingston Dolphin,"I found the similarity toJonathan Livingston Seagullto be highly annoying and distracting throughout the book. Dolphin just isn't as well written and has nothing new to say that Jonathtan Livingston Seagull didn't say better 30 years ago. Shouldn't we expect a new book to have something new to offer? The similarities are so grating. It's a poor imitation if not an outright plagiarism. The only benefit to reading this book is if you get it in Spanish, it's written at a nice easy level and is easy to follow."
3,Easy read reminding you to follow your dreams,"There are many books out there on why and how to follow your dreams. This one is a very ""light"" read (one afternoon), particularly suitable for those who love the ocean."
4,"ok, but nothing special","I have every China adoption book known to humans. This one is okay, nothing special, but not bad, either."
2,Good For Lighter Keyboards,If you own a Karma or TR61 then this is the case for you! If you own a Motif though look for the handles breaking off and the wheels as well :(Also those 2 handles on the top are rediculous! You only need one sturdy handle in the middle. Which is what I put in myself!I also replaced those awful rivets holding in the wheels with some good old fashioned nuts and bolts :)
3,Gator keyboard case,So far this case seems pretty good. I have used it once to ship my keyboard via Fed Ex and it held up okay but the material inside the case is already wearing in spots. Also there is limited padding to cushion a keyboard though mine survived okay. Be aware this case is big and though they call it a flight case airlines will charge extra due to its size and weight. Some airlines may not even accept it. Overall this item is good but a bit pricey for what it is.
5,Must Read,"Reading this book can help you wake up from a complicated life to an authentic one where you become the true creator of your own life. It provides simple and efffective tools to deal with the three main issues of health, sexuality and life purpose."
5,Excellent,"When I first heard Nek, I fell in love with his masculine and unique voice. He is genuinely among the best singers I have heard. I especially like his songs in Spanish."
4,Another great collection from a great player,"I don't have much to say: Illinois Jacquet is a master of the horn and acknowledged by many to be the father of the rock and roll saxophone. This is a fine selection of swing tunes, including some of my favorites: Bottoms Up, Sassy, and Jivin' with Jack the Bellboy.The only reason I did not give this record 5 stars is because there are other Illinois Jacquet collections that I prefer: Jumpin' At the Apollo, Flying Home: The Best of the Verve Years, and Bottoms Up (The Definitive Black & Blue Sessions (Paris, France 1974))"
2,Don't Buy This for the Rare Todd Tracks,"This one is a headscratcher, mostly noodling by Todd which served as a soundtrack to a regrettable/forgettable high school crime flick (redeemed only slightly by Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance). The style employed by Todd here could best be described as ""Beverly Hills Cop Meets Tiny Demons,"" foreshadowing some of the electronics he would later develop further in No World Order, but without the same direction or energy. As a clue to the direction he would later fully embrace in that landmark album, I suppose it's listenable, but only barely.As for the other tracks, I'm not familiar with these artists, but the songs come off generally as Pretty in Pink leftovers. Not bad, but not great either.Take it from someone who spent the time to hunt this one down, I would recommend you move on to more fertile Todd oddities......"
1,It does not work.,"I created a wireless bridge between a WAP11 and a WET11. To the WET11 I connected an Audiotron. The thing worked great for 30 minutes. After that, my Audiotron lost the connection to the network. I was able to make it work again, but again it failed. I read in the newsgroups that people are having similar problems connecting an Xbox to it. This is definitely a flawed product, and you should stay away from it until Linksys fixes its problems."
5,Great!,"I strongly suggest investing your money in this cheap piece of equipment. I used mine to get online with my Gamecube, which is very far aaway from my cable modem and PC. Once I purchessed this item, I was instantly online at amazing speeds. I strongly suggest this product. What I was mostly surprised about, was the good range which this product has indoors. I am extremely please :) buy it!"
4,Wet11 and Macintosh,It took a little while to figure out how to make this work with a Mac. First you change the IP address on your mac to the range of the default address on the wet11. Then change the IP address on the wet11 to the range of IP addresses on the airport. Then change the IP address on your mac back to the original setting and reboot the wet11. It works.
5,Connect different networks cheaply with any access point,"This tremendous and inexpensive piece of gear has two great features: one, you can plug any Ethernet device into it and thus attach it to a wireless Wi-Fi network; two, you can take a network of 30 or more devices connected in a wired configuration, and bridge all of their traffic to any access point within range. This lets you hook pods of computers together without wires, bypassing expensive or difficult drilling operations or wiring configurations. It's not perfect, as the full connection is the equivalent of less than the original 10 Mbps Ethernet, but it's an awful good solution for computer labs, homes that are too large for a single access point, or building small office networks. It's also worthwhile for community and neighborhood networks trying to extend their range."
5,works perfectly with apple,"the linksys WET11 is the perfect solution for people trying to get an apple computer onto a wireless network, but are not able to buy the standard airport cards since apple had the oh-so bright idea to stop producing them. just follow the instructions packaged with the ethernet bridge and your apple will be surfing wireless in no-time. It dawned on me that this product would work after trying to figure out how to get a mac wireless after hopelessly trying to configure the DWL-122 which never completely did the job"
1,WillieB,I'm starting an WISP and thought we had found the answer to our prayers in the perfect CPE device. It has ethernet connectivity to the computer which means no driver installs. It also has remote access via web browser and tells the % of the link. Which means we could connect to any of them in the field and check the signal. This is perfect. Unfort' it doesn't work [very well]. I took the Linksys USB adapter and put it on top of the truck. Then I had the WET11 connected to a 8.5db external telexwireless.com patch antenna about 15-20 foot off the ground. The usb adapter outperformed it in every way. The signal would have to get to 60% before the link quality came up enough to even use the WET11 on the network. We REALLY wanted this to work! It's a great idea. ...
1,Didn't work for me,I'm technically savvy but I couldn't get it to work with my network. I also brought it in to Best Buy to see if they could get it to work and they couldn't. From reading reviews there is clearly a problem with some of these units just not working.
1,Doesn't work!,I got one that doesn't work. I'm going with the Belkin F5D7330. I hope Linksys gets their act together someday.
2,Xbox or PS2 doesn't allow SECURITY feature to be used.,"This is a great product, but here is the problem. On your wireless router, you have to enable WEP which is a security setting so no one located within your routers range can hook up to your router without you knowing. With the WET, if you're using it to get your PS2 or XBOX online, you can't activate the WEP setting because you can't set the wireless device up with your XBOX or PS2 because only a windows operating system can do it. If you don't understand this, call Linksys Tech Support."
1,Never Works!!!,"I tried to use this product to hook up my xbox live. i figured it would be easy, you know, just set it up on the computer and plug it into the xbox. but ive had nothing but trouble! i have easily spent 20 hours on the phone with linksys tech support and have just had enough. im buying the xbox live wireless adapter, the WET11 just aint worth the hassle"
1,dud,"So I don't sound like I'm slamming Linksys. My USB device by them is awesome and my router works like a champ, but the WET11 is a dud. It doesn't set up easy (I never made it work) and Linksys' technical support clearly have no idea how to make it work.Four hours, a restocking fee and tons of heart ache later I'm looking elsewhere for my wireless bridge."
3,Good while it lasted,"I used this for a couple of years, and it worked flawlessly. Initially, I did not use WEP. I caught someone on my network, so I enabled WEP security. Now the bridge no longer connected. So, I tried to run the setup again and reconfigure. I was never able to connect, ever again. Not sure what the reset button does, but did not seem to make a difference.I've owned a lot of Linksys products. The main thing I've noticed since they were bought by Cisco - most of the products do not last more that 18 to 24 months before they start failing. I've been through 3 routers and 2 modems in less than 4 years ( all on an APC UPS' )."
3,"Not fully Xbox compatible - Live yes, System Link no.","Yes, it works for Xbox Live (the primary reason I purchased it). However, as my friends and I found out this weekend, system link does not work through the WET11 (or at least not the games we tried - Ghost Recon and Halo). This has been verified by several websites around the internet.I'm disappointed. It works great for Live, so I'll keep it if I can't convince Linksys to give me a refund, but not being able to play system link when my buddy comes over is a bummer."
3,"Good for what it is, but out-dated","As easy as this bridge was to setup and get working on my network, it isn't a good choice for those concerned about security or speed. The WET11 works great, but it is only 802.11b, so placing it on an 802.11g network has the potential of slowing down the wireless network. Also, being that it only supports 802.11b, WPA encryption is not supported...only WEP. Though I'm a big fan of Linksys products, I would shy away from this one."
2,"Don't buy this bridge, the new one from linksys works better","There is a new bridge from linksys that is [money amount]cheaper than this bridge and so much easier to set up for online gaming. For [money amount]buy the Linksys WGA11B Wireless-B Game Adapter, it rocks. It took me all of 5 minutes to get my playstation to connect to my wireless network with this bridge."
2,Quality Control Issues,"I own four of these. Two of them work flawlessly, but the other two have been nothing but trouble. These lock up frequently, particularly during periods of sustained activity. Linksys technical support was not helpful. They suggested that the problem might be due to an IP address conflict (which was not the case). Upgrading to the lastest firmware (version 1.5.4) has not helped either. I noticed that the two bad ones both have serial numbers starting with BBQ002, while the good ones have serial numbers starting with BBQ112."
3,"if it works, it works well - but beware some oddities","This box is *almost* a bridge -- but not quite. In particular, it ends up putting it's own ethernet address on packets, which is OK for basic IP use, but if (for example) you're using this to extend a network and have a DHCP server on the base-station side of the net, if that DHCP server is ISC-based, it will send responses that don't get correctly forwarded. On the other hand, if you're just forwarding a link, and have a NAT or other local DHCP server on the WET-11-side network, it'll work fine..."
4,Bought it ... can't configure for xbox/gamespy ... yet,"Has anyone been able to get this to work with the xbox/gamespy tunnel?I just got my wet11 from amazon and have had no problems getting it to work with a standard computer. But when I connect it to the xbox and try to play online using the gamespy tunnel, no dice.I'm having no problems playing xbox online with gamespy with a physical cable and same configuration.Anyone else have any luck with using xbox online with gamespy and the wet11 unit? Maybe xbox live will eliminate this problem???Thanks!"
3,Works if you leave it on channel 6,"I have a D-Link DI-614+ wireless router and tried to connect the WET11 bridge to my wireless network. However, after many many attempts, I discovered that the WET11 refuses to connect to any infrastructure channel other than 2-6. Even so, in order to get the WET11 to connect to my network, I had to change the network to channel 6. After verifying that the bridge had connected to the WLAN (green light came on), I then moved the network to another channel between 2-5. After using this bridge for a few days, I find that the bridge loses the wireless connection, and I have to change the network channel back to 6, and then back to my preferred channel, for the bridge to connect.Don't expect this particular bridge to work smoothly if you use a wireless infrastructure channel other than the default channel 6."
2,"A Better Purchase Would Be the ""G"" Bridge","Although it is somewhat more expensive, I would recommend considering the Linksys ""g"" bridge instead of this product. I had a much better experience with the ""g"" bridge and you will always appreciate its higher performance."
2,Better Range + Faster w/ new G version,"The new Linksys G Ethernet bridge functions much better. It is worth the investment. The WET11 has difficulty going one room away, while the G hasn't dropped signal yet.If you have it, return it and get the G. You'll be much happier with its range and performance.Otherwise, this product is easy to configure (assuming you understand wireless networks)."
5,Awesome. Works with XBox-live and with Audiotron,"I use my WET11 with both my XBox live and Turtle Beach Audiotron. (When I want to play the Xbox, I just switch out the CAT-5 in the back of the unit.) It works like a charm. With Xbox live, I'm even using a ""non-supported"" (by Microsoft) router-- the DLINK DL614+. No problemo. The Wet11 is great and has no problems with signal strength. I like it so much I may get two."
5,Perfect in Mixed Wireless environments and for Xbox Live,"I generally don't like linksys wireless gear because in the past I have found them to be a bit flakey in terms of keeping a connection. But in this case, I have to rate the WET-11 a two thumbs up. I run a Netgear wireless router and connectivity between the two is was perfect. Easy setup and a unfailing connection makes this product really worth the money.It should be noted too, that I'm running the bridge three floors below the router and I still get a 11mbs connection with very little latency problems."
2,Difficult to configure if not using Windows,"Got this to connect a desktop Macintosh to a wireless network. I had problems almost immediately:1) Setup via CDROM was OK, but once configured it would not recognize the router. Of note, this requires a Windows machine to work.2) Unable to upgrade the firmware via the utility downloaded from the Linksys website until I discovered that the computer had to be set to static.3) Using a web interface was impossible; none of the changes I made were saved to the WET11.Bottom line: If you want to use this for a single configuration without ever changing it, then it is OK. If you want to use this where you might want to occasionally change the configuration (i.e. change to peer-to-peer, change WEP, change base stations), then the difficulties in changing configuration make this too much of a hassle to get."
3,"buggy firmware, poor quality control?","latest firmware 1.3.2 doesn't reliably pass dhcp to the wired network. linux won't work at all, windows barely works. the unit i bought has very weak reception compared to a friend's, so it is going back. appears to be same hardware internally as similar device from d-link."
5,Attention XBOX and PS2 Owners!!!,"If you have a wireless network set up in your home, and want to shar you broadband connect from your PC, You Will Need This! Easy to setup and you will enjoy your online experiance with your video game system"
2,Does not work with Appletalk,"So Linksys claims this product works without drivers on Macintosh systems (""anything with an Ethernet port""). However, it does *not* handle AFP (Apple's file-sharing protocol) at all. If you are attempting to connect a Mac to a network file-share using AFP (common to versions of MacOS earlier than X), you will fail. This includes other pre-OSX Macs, as well as Microsoft UAM volumes.Otherwise this product works as advertised. The Mac could indeed surf the Internet and use network services utilizing standard TCP/IP protocol. However, I feel it is highly irresponsible for Linksys to claim that their product works on Macintosh PCs when 100% compatibility does not exist."
1,FOR THE XBOX!?!,"I've been at it for 16 hour strait now trying this Linksys WET11 to work with my XBOX and followed the instructions from the Linksys site too! Sometimes it connects through to my Linksys Wireless Access Point Router w/4 point switch BEFWS4, but most of time . . . forget about it! I'm gonna just run the CAT5 cable around the outside of my house to the den, now."
2,uninspired,there are no songs on this album that stir the spirit. i have a difficult time listening to the entire CD in my car because of its listless monotonous nature. there is nothing here that raises Lisa Loeb above the surf of the other similar sounding divas on the market today . good luck next time lisa. like the glasses though!
4,Lots of passion from that nerdy-looking girl,"The only criticism of this CD is to have the artist axe some of the goofy-looking photos in the liner notes. This is a good-looking lady, and glasses are a big turn-on for me, but some of these photos need to be destroyed. Different glasses and a bit of a makeover will probably sell a few more albums, too.With the fun paragraph done, I liked this one very much. This is the second Loeb CD I've tried, the first being ""Firecracker"". That one was nice. This one shows her growth as a songwriter. The nerdy image gets blown away very early in the work, as she shows a lot of emotion and excitement in several of the numbers. And the production is great. I like lyrics, but when they're backed up with too little accompaniment (see Suzanne Vega), it can frankly put you to sleep. This one has no such problems on most of the songs, and I look forward to more of her material."

2,Boring & Bland.... *yawn*,"After 3 dull Lisa Loeb outings, I give up. I've wanted to like her... really...and each CD has a few nice elements: decent arrangements, songs that start well, cute artwork.But when will she please show a spark? I keep waiting for something... anything... of interest to happen! It never does. There's a blandness, sameness, and low energy medium-tempo emptiness that dominates her music. It lulls me into a state of mind where I forget the CD is even on. Every time.This disc is just like the others.I love good pop music. That's why I don't like Lisa Loeb. *yawn*"
2,Repeat,If you have Loeb's other cd's than really you may not need this one. The cd is nice but it has many of the same songs on her other cd's. No need to pay for a cd with songs you already have.
3,Lisa's back with more of the same coffee-table rock...,"Cake & Pie is an album of pop music and collaborations with everyone ranging from countrymen Randy Scruggs (We Could Still Belong Together), rock god Zappa (Everyday, You Don't Know Me) and ultra-slick producer Glenn Ballard. Yet there's nothing groundbreaking here.First I thought diversity here, but the end result, other than Too Fast Driving, doesn't stray that far from coffee-table-Lillith Fair-Lite Rock-Oh So Gentle sound of her earlier recordings.Worth checking out are Drops Me Down, Kick Start and the undeniably catchy We Could Still Belong Together, You Don't Know Me and Payback."
4,Not Up to Par,"Lisa Loebs last two cds had set an unachievable standard that she just didn't live up to. This time she's come onto the market like she is trying to impress someone. There is a complete and different sound, yet underdog and kickstart have the same quality as the old cd. It's good, you just need to get used to it."
1,A poor photocopy,"This book looks like a poor photocopy. The type is pale, the photos are blurry, and the captions to the photos are illegible."
4,Mono - High Life,"Remember speed garage? Well, with the first of Mono's HIGH LIFE singles, there's no way to forget. 187 Lockdown put a bass-heavy house dub on the track, with sufficiently hands-in-the-air results, while Lowfinger and Next Century deliver odd mixes, both of them acid rock tinged. But the one to fast forward to is Herbert's mix, a deep and delicate version that demonstrates that when Matthew Herbert is on, he is on."
3,Beuatiful music,"I met Mono at Great Expectations soundtrack, and after that I have not stop looking for one Mono's cd. Then I bought it because it's a beautifl music and it contains a marvellous lirycs."
3,"Definitely, not the typical Tull","This is not the kind of album a typical Tull fan would yearn for,though numbers like Rocks on the road,When Jesus came to play,white innocence etc do make some impact.There is lot of electronic drumming as in Rock Island (ie their previous album)which definitely does not characterize Tulls music. Also Anderson's vocals ie paricularly in (Rocks on the road,white innocence) sounds very much like Dire straits. To sum it up,a decent but not a very good album by Jethro Tull."
3,Folkloristischer und akustischer Oberton,"Seit 1982 hat mir eigentlich kein Album der Gruppe im Gesamten mehr gefallen. Es gab durchaus noch gute Einzeltracks, z.b. ""Budapest"" aber ... Doch nach dem Anspielen von ""Catfish Rising"" kaufte ich mir die LP von 1992 mit der Bonus Maxi-CD sogleich. Die meisten Lieder haben gute Harmonien und sind vielleicht mit der Zeit von ""Songs from the Wood"" etwas vergleichbar. Der erste Song ist etwas härter und bietet ein flippiges Flötensolo. ""Jesus came to play"" ist instrumental hervorragend gemacht, daß der Text ein Schmarrn ist merkt man nicht, klasse ist die Akustikgitarre und die Drums. Anschaffenswert als einziges Album von 1982 bis 2000 nach meinem subjektiven Geschmack. Die Songs kamen auch bei Konzerten dieser Zeit neben den alten Sachen an. Gut ist auch ""This is not love"" mit einem tollen Flöten-Solo."
5,His Perfect Faithfulness,"I absolutely LOVED this book! It was incredible! My younger sister actually suggested I read it and I am definitely not sorry I did. This book is an encouraging story of a Christian couple and their amazing courtship. This book is great for everyone, but I strong suggest it for teens and struggling young adults; both male and female. It is gender friendly and an easy, but awesome read. I hope you enjoy it, and get as much out of it as I did."
1,Better quality control needed at facility.,"Hi-Capacity Camcorder Battery for: Panasonic PV-21DI had to return this product after several trys and refresh steps in the charger the results is a dead battery. The battery appeared to be new, however I would suggest that the seller did not check the shelf life that all batteries have coded on the battery. I had a used battery installed in the charger which did charge successfully. The return policy was easy to accomplish, but my location warrants a trip to the Post Office to print, label and package the product to return to sender. Time and transportation cost to return the defective battery results in a lost to the customer."
4,Battery for camcorder,"The initial battery I received would not charge. However, when I reported the problem, they quickly (2-days) sent another which charged properly. The battery works really well."
5,A family business,Lynn fasinates me with her insites on every day living and her sense of humor that makes life worth living.
2,Great shoes - if they would last.,"I bought three pairs of these because they are so comfy. I loved these shoes but the sole which is like rubbery, starts to come apart and every step you take the sole snaps and hits the bottom of the shoe making a loud noise and makes them embarrasing. I wish they were made better."
3,not very accurate,"Well after trying it several times, it does not seem to be accurate. Readings are way off sometimes. Not very happy with it."
3,Handy And Effective,"Perfect and easy to use. I use it to check my temps throughout my tortoise enclosure, including my tortoise. My only complaint is that the batteries that came with it were dead."
1,disappointing,"this book was a total waste of time in my opinion. there are a few pages of explanations and regular text, then the rest of the book is simple (and simplistic) exercises work book style. not what i'd expected"
3,Better-sounding on Naxos and Pearl,"I don't understand why the companies who originally recorded such historic performances generally fail in maintaining high standards in reissuing them. The sound on this disc is rahter muffled and lacking presence. Naxos recently came out with a far superior sounding ""Heldenleben"" (coupled with the most harrowing ""Tod und Verklaerung"" imaginable), although there is some room for improvement here, too. Pearl has a superb transfer of ""Don Juan"", coupled with the Phiharmonic ""Heldenleben."" The performances on the present disc are great, but are sonically represented in much better condition elsewhere."
1,Never received product,"I ordered this book from Lettersandkeys (Amazon seller) Dec 14th 2010. Never received it. My father, who I ordered it for ended up ordering it from another seller on Amazon and received it in 4 days. He did say the content of the book was disappointing. It didn't have the detail he was looking for."
5,Helps children get ahead,"I am not in to explaing, but lets just say son who hates Shakespear was able to understand it with the help of Cliffnotes! Enough to get me to purchase these for almost every book he has to read for help on plots, etc."
1,Most Sexist Book Ever!,"I am reading this ""book"" for my Gender and Law class and I have to say, DONT BUY IT if you really want to learn about men and their ""masculinity."" If there has ever been such a thing as ""reverse sexism"" this book embodies the entire ideal. From calling the BlueMan Group racist and stating as a corollary that men are turned on by violence (not adrenaline, violence). This book is not for an unbias class, but only for man-HATING extreme femenists.And this is coming from a pro-femenist!"
5,lovin' nek,"when i first bought his CD, i was expecting to like one song ""laura no esta"", well now i'm hook on Nek. he's a wonderful artist, with a very smooth/sexy voice and his lyrics are very unique and powerful. i'm his number one fan in Boston. Nek you're the best! when will you be coming to boston i wanna see u live! best of luck to u! Muuuuuuuah :o)"
1,Bias,"When I first read this book a few years ago, I was very dissapointed at the fact that Mr Beatie has not given credit to the true creator, the mexican horseman, of the so called ""western saddle"". I would rather recommend a study on saddles done by the Smithsonian Institite. Mr Russel's book, like many other books on western culture is full of bias. This book is not worth the price."
2,Dissapointing,"I recieved this book as a gift and was SO EXCITED.I wished to learn more about old saddles, dates, maufacturing, types, etc.I was really dissapointed when I sat down to read it.It was very vauge...not at all what I was expecting.And NOT WORTH (the money) (to me)."
5,Excellent research material for reproducing antique saddles.,"Provides hundreds of detailed photos and drawings from the first saddles in history to modern day. Great detail on construction and styles. The bibliography lists tons of book titles and their authors that the information was compiled from. Also, a long list of early saddlemakers listed by state. Helpful in identifying possible age for antique saddles. This is THE book on saddles! Truly, a rare find!"
2,Dissapointing,"I recieved this book as a gift and was SO EXCITED.I wished to learn more about old saddles, dates, maufacturing, types, etc.I was really dissapointed when I sat down to read it.It was very vauge...not at all what I was expecting.And NOT WORTH $50.00 (to me)."
3,overwhelming amount of information.,"This book contains a lot of information. I was looking for a specific saddle which unfortunately I didn't find any information about in the text. There are several photos which seem to have a vague description and not the information I was looking for. I found some of the information in this book to be a little disunited. There is no doubt the author knows the subject, and there is certainly a lot of good and relevant information within the pages. I need a book like this about english saddles as well. Any suggestions??"
3,Why Melville is not a great poet ( My feeling of this),"I think that one of the first questions which must be asked about the poetry of Melville, is why it is on the level of Melville's greatest prose, which is a most poetic prose at times. Why is it that Melville's real power is in those vast cathedral-tunes of sentences which sing together though they seem to shoot of in all directions, the prose of his great narratives?It is almost as if the complexity of Melville's thought when confined to small lines , loses its power in feeling .And its rhythm too somehow goes off , and leaves us without the sense and power of the memorable.'Great poetry' as I understand it is 'lines which resound in the mind and return to us again and again' My sense is that Melville's lines do not make it in this way.I of course may well be wrong, but this is my feeling."
4,Hard- but good,"This is a book about learning. Psychology is not an easy subject, but the author does a good job. The concepts are a little hard to grasp but the author does a great job with a difficult subject."
2,not too great,This book was not written in the clearest fashion. He could have done a much better job and given more examples to make the concepts more concrete.
2,Needed for class,"I needed this book for school, it was very costly in the school book store however, I received it at over half the price from amazon, thanks Amazon for the wonderful prices."
3,j b Le noir /. Mojo Boogie,"this recording was a real disappointment. Poor sound quality in the recording, with some pretty bland backup. I don't care if these guys are supposed to be the cream of Chicago for that era.....they just don't add much to the mix. If this was the only way to experience J. B., then I'd say go with it.....but just hearing him with his guitar like on the L+R recordings (Vietnam Blues) now that's the real deal! J. B. was so musical, if you need to add anything to his voice and guitar, it sure wasn't much."
4,Check it out!,"50s blues was a great time for music. I have always enjoyed Lenoir's work along with people like Sonny Boy Williamson and Big Bill Broonzy. Listening to songs like ""Let's Roll"" and ""The Mojo"" in cd quality really bring out the best in my love for the artist. I dont see why anyone wouldn't at least like the music. The sad thing is taht J.B. died at the age of 38 in 1967 and I knew there would have been more hits. Check it out!"
3,I enjoy the emotional rollercoaster of each moving song,"Vocally one must be impressed with the divine talent of Shakespear's sister. With every lyric you find yourself evaluating a place and time in your life that will forever stand out. ""Stay"" which is most popular will have you doing just that!"
2,Best SONG from '96,"The CD was in great condition, and I got the song I wanted...I just didn't realize that I'd only ever like one song by this band."
1,Win2k OS issue & heat factor,"Unit runs hot, and doe not work under Win2k. Unit hangs within 1-15 minutes. Pulling card out of slot resolves the issue, reinserting resets cards, but hangs again within 1-15 minutes.Tech support (in Philippines) cannot help. Issue under review by Linksys.Update: Linksys would not fix. Warranttee not worth the paper it's printed on. The unit is in the garbage, as my new laptop has built is WiFi THAT WORKS!!"
1,Disappointing Product,"I have to agree with another reviewer; the card seems like a great deal, but it just doesn't work. After several e-mails back and forth with their ""technical support"" department, they stopped responding. The basic problem is after running for a while, the card will lock the computer forcing you to remove the card to restore the computer. Purchased a DLink DWL-A650 as a replacement and have not had a problem. Linksys will not take the card back for repair or exchange. Most people are having problems with Windows 2000, but my problem was with Windows XP using a Dell Inspiron laptop."
1,Caused laptops to hang,"I purchased two of Linksys' 802.11a PC Cards, due to pleasant experiences with Linksys products in the past. However, this product caused two laptops (Dell Latitude C840, Toshiba Portege 3480) to hang. The laptops were both running Windows XP. I contacted Linksys' technical support, who stated that the problem was due to IRQ conflicts, and that I would have to contact the laptop manufacturer technical support to reassign the IRQs; however, Dell's technical support confirmed that the IRQs cannot be reassigned. I again contacted Linksys' technical support who told me that the product was not compatible and that I should return it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS THING--NEW OR USED!!!,"These things do not work. I have two of them that I can't get to function in any PC I put them in. I tried them on Windows 98SE, Windows 2000, Windows XP. One of them totally locks up every PC I put them in. I got the other one to work for about 5 minutes and then it has never worked since."
2,Down right awful,"In this poor excuse for a comedy DVD, 6 no-name female ""comics"" stumble over poor writing, poor delivery, and general awkwardness on stage. Watching this trash felt like rubbernecking a car accident on the freeway. The audience isn't into the material, and no one looks happy to be there. Only buy this if you like watching comics bomb for over an hour."
1,"Women who think funny = overuse of ""the F word""","These women aren't funny. Obviously, they seem to think that they need to have garbage mouths in order to be ""naughty"". You can be naughty and funny without using ""F"" every-other-word. And shimmying the body parts isn't necessary, either. I don't mind language (love Robin Williams) as long as it accompanies funny. This DVD is a waste of money."
5,Waterford Beautiful!,Love the fact that there is free shipping on these glasses. They make an excellent gift for my excellent sister at christmas time. Thanks Amazon!
5,"Praise, Worship at it's Best","If you are called to Praise and Worship your Lord (aren't we all!)Then you should love any of Paul Wilbur music. He is about all I want listen to. You know The Lord formed Israel for himself. They have been worshipping G_D for 100's of generations, they know what they are doing! If you love the Word of God, it is here in this music. I have moved many people to this man, and no one has ever left his CD's behind. He has been anointed for this day and time, right before the return of Our Lord! He will teach you how to worship and you will love it all the way."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.,"It's amazing that no one has ever written a really good book about the Rolling stones founder Brian Jones. I myself have been a Brian Jones fan for over twenty years and during this time there have been seven books written about him and only one book was decent. Jeremy Reed's book is filled with unfounded rumours that Brian Jones was forming a supergroup with both John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix, and that he was murdered. Now there's another new unfounded rumour. Brian Jones was a bisexual because he wore womens hats and jewelry. Okay. If you like tabloid books you will love this one. The author did absolutely no research, he interviewed only one person that knew Brian Jones, and takes most of his information from other tabloid biographies about Brian Jones. I suggest DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,the last decadent,"Since the Monterey Pop Festival took place in 1967, not 1969 as noted within, I have to seriously question the accuracy of what i've just read."
3,Brian Jones - for when you can't tell the truth to your parents,"If you ever need to explain why you did something bad, tell them you did it for Brian Jones, although they may not believe you! That's what a buddy of mine told my parents when they found a receipt for some soft-core porn we rented - there was a Brian Jones at my high school. Kind of a weirdo, and it was the first thing that I thought of. I have not read this book but I bet it is just OK."
1,Buyers beware,"You won't find it mentioned in the write-ups here, but the packaging for these dishes says, ""Lid is for storage use only."" I don't see the point of purchasing these as microwave dishes if the lid can't be used (and I wish hadn't). Furthermore, the lids don't snap on tightly enough to make them securely waterproof. They would be okay for refrigerator storage, but I wouldn't trust them to hold liquids if upset. I certainly wouldn't use them to carry my lunch in my briefcase."
3,Cover could be more secure,"Title says it all. Dish itself hold up well in micro and freezer, but the cover doesn't really seal shut. It just sits on the lips of the container. Not very secure for storage purposes."
4,I bought this for Here We Come.,Anyone who can freak the 1967 Spider-Man TV show theme song into a beat has got skills. I bought this CD just to get my hands on Here We Come. I'm listening to it as I type this. The other jams are pretty good too.All in all a good effort by Timbaland.
4,kings of blues no doubt,"Chicago's own Buddy Guy is quite wiz when it comes to the guitar. It is quite a coincidence and a delight that Otis Rush came to Chicago in the mid 20th century to dominate Chicago blues with Guy. Therefore, this was a great CD to listen to because of its unbeatable combination of the two guitarists. i would recommend the CD to anyone, beginner or expert of Blues."
3,Oh Well...,"As a fan of Weather Report from the very start, I have every WR, Zawinul Syndicate and Zawinul solo recording on vinyl and CD. I've caught live performances of Weather Report and Zawinul Syndicate and was looking forward to getting this DVD as soon as I saw it was available. Oh well, I must say I am not thrilled by this effort.The performance is okay BUT the video editing is terrible. Choppy, jumpy, cluttered and annoying to watch. The camera men keep getting in each others way and seem to find it hard to get clear shots of the performers. The sound quality is somewhat muddled too... the mix of the instruments sounds uneven at times.I was hoping for something better, a shame since video recordings of this fine group are virtually non-existent. Short performance for a lot of money... I leave it up to you. Die hard fans will no doubt want to own this but I was left feeling unsatisfied."
5,The only book you need for a great trip!,"My husband and I did an awesome 12 day roadtrip to Niagara Falls - Toronto - Ottawa - Montreal - Quebec City and (besides internet research) this was the ONLY book we used. It gave great overviews of the sights of the cities, and also supplied a bunch of ""off the beaten path"" less-touristy options. In whatever city we were in, I liked being able to visually pick out the sights to see based on the photos and illustrations, and the bits of history are a nice and not too overwhelming way of reading up on the meaning/purpose of different sites and attractions. Our copy of this guide was tattered and extremely dogeared by the time we got back home!"
4,"Another DK product--Oh, Canada!","The Eyewitness Travel series is a nice resource. One downside: It is not as extensive in its coverage as, for instance, Frommer's. Nonetheless, it is a lushly produced volume and provides considerable useful information.The book is organized as follows: The first part is an introduction to Canada. Then, area by area (e.g., Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Central Canada, British Columbia and the Rockies, and Northern Canada). Then, a section on traveler's needs--where to eat, where to stay, entertainment, shopping, and attractions. Finally, a survival guide.Overall, a useful resource, although not quite as informative of a publication like Frommer's."
3,"Okay, but does not do much justice to a lot of Canada","I have a number of quibbles with this guide. Coverage of Montreal and Toronto is very skimpy, as well as the areas beyond the Great Lakes (which isn't covered in too much detail), particularly the Northern and Central parts. The great photos do save it quite a bit, though. I hope that next time, DK can make a better guide!"
3,Not Perfect!,"This is a very attractive book with lots good pictures and information on countryside, historical sites and so such. However, it contains almost nothing on modern Canada and its cities and also doesn't have much information on Northern Canada. This book is fine for the tourist who only wishes to see historic buildings and Niagra Falls but not very good anyone else. The maps and and information on accomadation, restaurants and so on is also not particularly good, as with most Eyewitness guides."
5,I REALLY needed this!,"After enduring too many instances of ""The Blue Screen of Death,"" it eventually became apparent that the culprit was a bad HD. Had to buy two as they needed to be identical. The great price and prompt shipping on these gave my aging computer a new 'lease on life!' Now, I like my computer again!"
4,Good book,"It is a good book to start material science. The first chapter a good overview and has interesting insight to get the reader interested in material science and engineering. However, I feel in the second chapter it goes too far back into detail about atoms, electron clouds, quantum numbers and things of that sort. Just seems like stuff from a general chemistry book rather than a material science book."
3,Wrong Edition,I ordered the 5th edition of a book and the seller sent me the 3rd edition. After some back and forth the seller finally refunded my money. They did send the book quickly but did not have the best customer service.
3,Acceptable,"The book is in OK condition. The seller didn't state that it was written in, nor did they state the extent of the corner damage. Nevertheless, still perfectly readable and acceptable. It would have just been nice to be notified of its minor damages before purchase."
2,TAKE A LOOK AT THE COVER ART,"The cover art of this album already signalize the listener that Gary is not feeling very well the way his career is going, and it's clealry weary of metal / hard rock. The cover has just his face in close-up, nothing more, typical of Barry Manilow, Mariah Carey and others solo artists. THis was the last record by Gary in which rocking was the rule. After this one, he made his famous transition to blues. THis album has his good moments, but they are so few ..."
3,Electro-Acoustic Music Beyond Babbittry,"Sometime during my teen years I was privileged to visit with my classmates the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Studio (N.B. it has been renamed!)We saw the room-sized RCA Electronic Music synthesizer that Milton Babbitt used to create his pioneering, if uninspiring bleeps, blips, and bloops.American composer John McGuire, who has been living abroad(Germany) for for the past three decades, has been creating electro-acoustic music of considerable worth. He has produced electronic textures that possess a shimmering lyricism, rhythmic and perceptual subtleties, and able to hold this listener's attention for full 20 minutes of each compositionon this (British) Sargasso CD. Give it a try."
4,Great Romance Book!!!,"This is a great book that I absolutly love. Sure it's sad, but it's more like actual life that perfect like most romance stories are. When Ivy Lyon's (the main character) boyfriend, Tristan Carruthers, dies, she thought she would never get over it. She declared that she would never love someone again. Tristan comes back as an angel, but at first she didn't see him, since she stopped believing in angels when he died (she believed in angels before he died). Philip, Ivy's brother put her straight and she finally got to see Tristan again as a golden shimmer. But then she starts to fall for her step-brother, Gregory Baines, in and out of love. Then she starts suspecting that Tristan's death might not be an accidents, and Gregory is one of the suspects. When Tristan finds out that his angel mission is to save Ivy, he discovers that some people would kill their best friends to murder Ivy - and that someone killed him."
5,This is the best book I've read yet!!!...,This book is the best!!!! I couldn't put it down!!! I would recomend it to anyone who loves romance and suspence!!!!
5,Wonderful,This book is one of the few books I enjoy. I could not put it down. Elizabeth Chandler really gets you into the story. I rcomend this book to anyone who loves and wants to be loved.
5,I Loved it!,"It's a great book , wonderful and exciting. i loved the way the writter described how tristan love ivy so much that to prove his love to her he came back and tried to save her life , even if it mean that she was destined to love somone else . Lacey was cool . i like the way she takes every thing so lightly ,and she has a great sense of humour .What was dissapointing is that lacey didn't tell tristain about her love for him ! But it is still a great book!i give it a 10 out of 5 ********** wonderful!!"
5,BEST NOVEL I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME!!---Leanne,I borrowed the book from a friend of mine and I couldn't believe how well written and interesting it was to read. I have not read a novel this good in a extremely long time. My applause to the author. Never before has a book been able to make me cry. I refused to put the book down. I had so much in common with Ivy it was scary. Since I read the book I have taken a great interest in angels---I believe that the people we love--alive or dead---are our personal angels watching over us. I recommend this trilogy to everyone who believes in love and angels.
3,Umm... Not so good,"At fist this book kept me reading, and I couldn't put it down! then, by the time I got to ""Soulmates"", it lost it. When I was finished the story left a bad taste in my mouth."
3,"It was OK, but not particularly great...","Goscinny & Uderzo were an excellent TEAM, and with one of them gone, it's noticeable that the Asterix series isn't quite the same. This wasn't a bad book, but I could tell that the writing has fallen off a notch. Those who have read several of the earlier books will notice this. Still, it's not like I hated this book. The illustrations remain as good as ever."
4,Comic book,Cute book - I got it for my husband after he told me he grew up with these comics. We read it together.
3,So-so,"Obelix drinks the magic potion, and turns into stone. The druid tries to make an antidote, which instead turns Obelix into a child. He then has to go to Atlantis in hope of finding a cure. Meanwhile, a ship full of mutineers visit the village.This is one of the newest Asterix adventures. Uderzo has created some pretty good adventures even after Goschinny's death, and here is another interesting premise and it almost works. It's entertaining, but the resolution is something of a letdown. Recommended for fans. New Asterix readers might want to start with another book."
3,Another amusing adventure.,"Albert Uderzo, Asterix and Obelix All at Sea (Dargaud, 1996)Spartacus-- oh, excuse me, Spartakis-- has managed to steal Caesar's galley out from under his nose, and is fleeing for the indomitable Gaulish village. The Romans are in hot pursuit, so the Gauls get ready for the battle. No one's paying attention to Obelix... and we finally find out what happens to him when he drinks the magic potion. Hey, we only waited three decades! That alone is worth the price of admission here, but there's another clue to something upon which Uderzo might eventually expand (keep your eyes sharp!). Good stuff. ***"
5,A Wonderful First Chapter Book,"As reviewed by Marjan Glavac, editor of The Busy Educator's Newsletter.Any teacher, librarian or parent looking for a first chapter book for their children, should take a look at Edward Faine's Little Ned Stories- Book One. Richly illustrated with 45 black and white illustrations and three separate stories, this book will appeal to any child between the ages of 4-8.My six year old son sat down with me and enthusiastically read and laughed and studied each illustration as he turned each page of the three stories: ""No Soap""; ""The Boy Who Hated Halloween""; and ""The Ocean Vacation."" The stories are very easy to read, have universal appeal and would make a great addition to any young child's library."
4,Best practices that work!,"If you're involved in any aspect of software implementations, and you desire to improve your product delivery for your user community, then this book is a must have. It offers practical approaches along with useful examples.What I particularly like is the incremental approach using the five best practices in Chapter 2. The big-bang hammer approaches, which I have lived through and can, relate to in Chapter 4, just don't work!I have used the author's best practices for my last three projects and the results were very successful: Project 1 - no major bugs found during end user acceptance testing, implemented three days early; Project 2 - implemented on-time with a satisfied user community; Project 3 - again, no showstopper issues during user acceptance resulting in a product that was delivered as expected by the user community. The suggested best practices do in fact work.This book is my guide and reference for managing software implementations. I highly recommend it!"
4,Practical Ideas to Stimulate Discussion & Get Results,"I conducted a survey in our organization based on the material from the ""Barriers"" chapter of ""Leading Culture Change ..."". We found barriers and a few ""breaches"" between the barriers. We presented the book's ideas about dealing with the barriers to our steering committee. It sparked a lively and continuing discussion. It brought problems out on the table, got some senior people to acknowledge the issues and is helping us with solutions. This got us to engage and address some deep misunderstandings (quality and business processes aren't disjoint; planning is more than requirements and a schedule) that might not have come out earlier. Having the material in the book made it easy to create the survey and to focus the resulting discussion."
3,The Last Good Man,I read a lot of mysteries so this one was good for a nice break. It moved right along and was currant on treatment for breast cancer.
5,Great Book by Kathleen Eagle,Entertaining book which keeps you attention. Also gives insight as to fears and feelings a woman has following breast cancer. Found it hard to put this one away at night.
3,Sweet story...but not quite enough,"This was a sweet story that also dealt with some difficult issues. While I liked it, I ended the book feeling like the author didn't give me quite enough. If felt like when the resolution came, it was quick and lacking. I'm glad I was able to read it for free as I don't feel it would have been worth the regular price."
3,Okay,"A little too racey for me. Although, it is written about a woman trying to deal withy breast cancer. I wish the author had toned it down a bit."
3,Kinda of boring,Nothing earth shattering. Really lacked the emotional connection and the physical connection wasn't pulse racing. It would have been nice if a plot would have been thrown in.
3,Makes for good reading,It is a very good book. It doesn't have the action I expected but is good reading anyway. I would recommend it to other people.
5,Good Read.,"I really enjoyed this book and I am looking forward to reading other books by Kathleen Eagle. I found myself caring about each character in the story, especially Clay!"
4,Clay was too good,"Savanah had her battles, but she did some of the people wrong! Clay was her friend, from back in the day, and he would be there when she needed him most. Who was gonna be there for Clay? They had memories from the past and he wants to make some new ones too? Then there's her daughter, looking too familiar. Clay's just a horseman, a very serious man when it comes to the horses.I stayed mad at her for the way she treated Clay. No one treated him good enough, he works hard at every thing he does.I read it all the way through just to see if Savanah ever messured up!"
5,Loved it!,I loved this book. It is a great old fashioned love story. I couldn't stop reading it once I started and I didn't want it to end.
3,Predictable But Good,This was your average predictable love story but it was good. The writer has obviously done her homework on horse care and management. I would be interested in reading a sequel.
3,"Good story, but not a romance to me.","I enjoyed the story, and the writing, but it really didn't seem like a romance to me. The story focuses a lot on Savannah, and her recovery, and I couldn't quite buy the falling in love part. I would have labeled it more women's fiction, because it is really more about her. I rate it a 3 because of my disappointment in it not being a romance, not for poor quality of writing or story."
2,A disappointing read,"Kathleen Eagle is gifted author who creates books that are impossible to put down. When The Last Good Man was released, I immediately went to my local bookstore and gladly paid full price for a chance to enjoy this latest Kathleen Eagle book. What a disappointment! The only compelling character is Clay, the man Savannah marries. Savannah, the main character, is an unsympathetic self-involved woman who struggles far too long to come to terms with the after effects of breast surgery. The book is a series of endless drawn-out conversations between Savannah and other characters who populate this slow moving story. Mrs. Eagle's other books were beautifully written and compelling. The Last Good Man is truly not a light romance novel. It is a tedious reading experience. If you're determined to read this book, get it from your local library or wait until the book becomes available in paperback."
2,Not my style.,"I decided to try this book on my Kindle bc of the cheap price, but I was not a fan. The premise of the book was interesting, but maybe my issue is more with her writing style. I'm usually someone who will read a book in one sitting when I'm completely engrossed. It took me so long to finish it, and I would usually just keep reading it bc I was bored at the moment. I did want to see how it ended, but I just would not recommend it at all."
1,This is a good read?,"This book got crazy quick. I didn't even finish the book. Complete waste of time. Don't bother, there are much better books to read."
2,Fluff not well developed,"The plot was interesting but the development of the romance between the main characters was not done well or completely. An okay read, but I was left feeling that it needed more meat. It read more like it was written by an amateur and when I purchased it, I thought it was represented as being written by an established author."
3,Fair collection,"I don't have much to say about Holderlin's poetry, which I find a bit stodgy and ungraceful, but I have to say I cannot read it in German, which I believe is a necessary prerequisite to any true read of poetry. I would merely like to share a poem that I found beautiful:SunsetWhere are you? Dazzled, drunken my soul grows faintAnd dark with so much gladness; for even nowI listened while, too rich in goldenSounds, the enrapturing youth, the sun-godIntoned his evening hymn on a heavenly lyre;All round the hills and forests re-echoed it,Though far from here-to pious nationsWho still revere him-by now he's journeyed.Wo bist du? Trunken dammert die Seele mirVon aller deiner Wonne; denn eben ist's,Dass ich gelauscht, wie, goldner ToneVoll der entzukende SonnenjunglingSein Abendlied af himmlischer Leyer speilt';Es tonten rings die Walder und Hugel nach.Doch fern ist er zu frommen Volkern,Die ihn noch ehren, hinweggegangen. (pp 16).Enjoy the archaic read."
5,Rocks!,"If you're only going to buy one, buy the one that will do it all. If you're going to buy a couple for different jobs, you'll still want to have this one. The adjustability just can't be beat. Makes every cut easier."
5,Great product,"My ex-boyfriend (note ""ex"") loaded my Ipod from his laptop. All I had left from that relationship was my Ipod! I had never used ITunes, never used this software either, so rest assured you can figure it out pretty easy. It worked like a charm for me. Well worth the price of the product to back-up all my songs in case my Ipod fails."
1,BEWARE - Windows 7 alert,"As of 2/12/2013, I was unable to access the website which has the required download for this to work on Windows 7 and other upgraded systems. Check [...] before purchasing to see if site is accessible.the website"
5,Pod+Rescue rescues me,"What a great software experience - very user friendly product with intelligent, helpful tech support - no getting swamped by technology."
4,Rescue for iPod,"I purchased a new computer and somehow I lost my iTune library. I used the software to transfer my library from my iPod to my new computer. The software was easy to use and worked great for anything I ripped from cds. All the information (title, artist, date, ...)transfered. The only issue I had was transfering borrowed music. The software would stop and give an error. All that needed to be done was to accept the error and the song would transfer to the computer. Same thing for the playlist, but you can export the playlist to an Excell file then redo each list if you want to. I transfered over 6,400 song. Even with the ""errors"" it only took me about 1 hour. It was a lifesaver!!!"
3,It worked,"But I can only give it 3 of 5 stars because, it has a very ""clunky"" operation. The instructions did not go into detail. I had to ""wing it"" not something I wanted to do with $100s of dollars on my iPod at risk of getting erased."
2,Worked but be Careful,"My hard drive crashed including my iTunes library, so I purchased this product to transfer the songs from my iPod to another computer. I was able to get the songs to the iTunes library on the other computer, BUT, none of the songs would transfer back onto the iPOD because the songs ""were not authorized purchases on the new computer"". (Yes, I authorized the iPOD on the computer but that made no difference.) Long story short, be careful, the software does what it says, but that may not solve your problem."
5,Works Perfect,My computer crashed and all my son's songs where on his Ipod with no backup. He (age 18) intalled this program and was able to get all his songs off the IPOD back onto the new computer (Windows) without a hitch. Worked perfect and was easy.
3,"Basically, it works","this saved most, but not all of my files (don't know what happened there- it seems like a few are missing). I also had some files on my ipod from personal recordings i had made and titled on my computer. ALL of these recordings transferred over, but NONE of the labels imported to itunes properly.Therefore I had tons of files that just had arbitrary 4 letter tags as names and I had to rename all of them manually. Big pain."
3,Did not transfer all songs for me,About 12 of my 47 gigs weren't transferred to the new itunes library. These included both songs purchased from itunes (but not all) and songs I uploaded from my CD collection.Many of the same songs were successfully transferred the first time I did this several years ago using a program called Tune Tools.
5,Me salvo la vida,"Cuando pense que todo estaba perdido, compre este producto, me manera simple transporto toda la musica de mi IPOD a mi nueva PC, en verdad gracias por existir IPO+RESCUE...save my life & my music..."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful...","I was very frustrated with this product... It did not come in time and my computer did not even recognize the CD. Therefore, I was unable to get the product to work... It could just be a one time occurance - but I was aggrevated that I wasted money on it. Instead I just downloaded a program offline for $20 that worked GREAT!!"
1,No Good,I purchased a Cucusoft DVD Ipod Coverter Program. When I went to the help section the screen was different then the one I purchased so the help section was no good. I e-mail the company several times for help and got no answer? The program never did work. Be careful to make sure you can get a refund before you buy. This company claims a 30 day refund. I will probably have to fight this with my credit card company to get my money back. I'm still looking for a good program for my new Ipod Touch. Thanks Ron
1,Fair and Balanced Reporting,"I can't change the number of stars, but after corresponding with Tastybytes' prompt and nearly courteous tech support, I will shift the blame to Amazon.Amazon is not providing the full list of requirements, so I will provide them here (for Windows):- Windows 2000 or XP- Latest service packs recommended.- 500MHz Pentium of better- 128MB RAM (256 recommended)- A working connection to an iPod- iPod software v1.2 or higher- Quicktime v6.5.2 or higher- iTunes v4.7 or higher- Not required per se (and not on the box), but Tastybytes support recommends USB 2.0."
5,Chubby Wise - In Nashville,"Chubby Wise must be one of the most unsung( no pun intended ) fiddlers of all time. He was in on the birth of bluegrass and played a major role in creating the fiddlers place in what was to become a whole new style of music. There couldn't be a better example of this man's talent than this album. There are no trick songs here - just plain old country and bluegrass - a purist's dream. It could have been cut in his parlor on a Sunday afternoon. He plays the music he loves and it shows. The backup is great. With Gene Wooten(dobro), Bobby Osborn(mandolin), Terry Eldridge and Larry Perkins(guitars), and Mike Bub(bass) you get some of the best country pickin' you could ask for. It don't get no better'n this!"
1,Axis and allies PC game,Game does not work on new computers. Graphics do not show up and all support websites are obsolete. Would not recomend unless you still have an old computer (95\98).
1,Horrible Artificial Intellegence!,"For this game, A.I. should be changed to ""R.S."" for ""Real Stupid."" There are different settings for AI depending on how hard you want the game to be if you are playing against the computer. Anyone who is even slightly familiar with the game will beat the five star general rating which is the highest setting for AI. I can beat the computer in two or three turns depending on how stupid it is that day.If you are playing against another person, there are some glitches to deal with. Some times you cannot land your aircraft in territories that you should be able to land in.About the only thing I like about the game is that you don't have to waste 20 minutes setting it up and the battles are done quickly. Aside from that, forget it."
1,Contrary to description this game DOES NOT work on XP,"I have no idea if this game is any fun to play as it will not load on either XP or Vista. I knew Vista would be a stretch, but the description says it will run on XP. It doesn't."
3,Good translation of a board game.,"This game is enjoyable with a smart combination of chance and strategy. It allows you to customize just how much chance and strategy you actually want to use before, and during, game-play. Unfortunately there are several bugs that can leave the user very frustrated but not all at loss."
1,the disc did not run,i only disliked because de disc did not run but I have played the taebol game and is good so de contens of the game most be good i didint send it back because i opend de package and you cant return the disc if you opened the package
1,Hey there,I sent this back to the sender several months ago and haven't heard from you or the original owner that shipped it to me.
1,Perplexing,"Strange is it not, that the same reviewer give five stars for every volume of this ""back yard"" production that is, at best, high school project level."
5,Great LP,All the vinyl releases thus far are excellent in terms of the ELO catalog. I am figuring if you are buying you already know enough about the actual album. The pressing is clean and sounds great which is really what I would imagine folks reading this want to know.
4,ADULT EMERGENCY POCKETBOOK,"Handy and compact! Great quick reference for dosing regimens and treatment protocols. Not error free though, so should only be used to jog one's memeory. Otherwise a must."
5,I love this item.,I love this item. I would recommend this product to everyone who loves saguaro cactus. I live in the desert so it's lovely on my mailbox.
1,Do Not Buy This Table,"I purchased this table for my three-year-old granddaughter. When my son opened the box, there was a strong, toxic lacquer smell that overpowered the entire house. Even after airing out the table in fresh air, the toxic odor persisted. This is not a toy for a toddler, or for any child, for that matter. My son has returned the table, and at least Ammazon was as gracious as usual in accepting it for a full refund, including shipping.Calico Critters Playtable"
3,"missing pieces, no directions to assemble included",Actually my review is with Amazon. The table was missing the back of the drawer and thus you cannot use the drawer at all. I have reordered this piece but after one week I have still not received it.
2,Terrible smell,We purchased this table from amazon for our 2 1/2 year old. We set the box in our basement until we had a chance to assembleit and the next day our basement smelled awful. We opened the box and the smell is imbedded in the wood as well. Ourdaughter played with this table at a store and loved it but it smells so bad that I am not sure we can put in her room or in the house for that matter. I am extremely disappointed with it.
2,Missing parts and poorly put together,"The package was missing a leg (no small part to miss) and some of the needed special bolts. Result was no toy for the birthday party...........Some of the embeded bolts were not well set making strong assembly impossible.All round I would never order something like this from these folks again, and recommend others beware.A couple of weeks later........ I upgraded this to two stars after getting the replacement parts. I am still not happy with how some of the embeded bolts work and there was obviously a quality control problem with the original shipment. But now that it is together with all the pieces my granddaughter seems to really like it."
3,Love the table not the smell!,"We just bought this table for our daughter & were immediately alarmed by the paint fumes. After a few hours we had no choice but to put it outside. By the second day, the fumes were still at a point where we had to keep it outside. I am leaning toward filing a formal consumer complaint.As for the table itself, it is a perfect way to play with the Calico Critters. In addition, it looks great & the storage drawer is extremely functional - perfect for switching out toys!"
1,Bad Services,"I was wondering, cause after 5 days they send to me a sorry message and my money back because they didn't have the book any more.What a good deal!"
3,Good book- no index?,"I'm doing regulatory intelligence for a client, and this book gave me a lot of great detail about drug development during all the stages, draft guidances and how they're used, etc (I'm about half way through now).It would be pretty much perfect if it had an index. HUGE downside. I'm combating that by highlighting what I might want to find later and using sticky tabs, but with a textbook this big, it's very cumbersome to go back and find things. I would really like to go back and find out where draft guidances are referenced, but that's pretty near impossible. Never even thought to check if the book had one...I just assumed it would!"
3,Groundhogs Live at Leeds 1971,"In order to promote the album ""Split"", the Groundhogs were booked as support on the Rolling Stones 1971 British tour. Glybn Johns recorded five tracks from the set at Leeds. After the gig, Mick Jagger made a gift of the tape to McPhee. A promotional album was made from this tape. Only 100 copies were pressed and distributed to American radio stations. McPhee lost contact with the master tape and despite various attempts to locate it, its whereabouts still remain a mystery. The 5 songs from ""Live at Leeds"" were released in the 1980's album ""Hoggin' The Stage"" which came from one of the few original promo pressings to have surfaced. The sound is crude but the performance is genuine Groundhogs at its best, and it is an historical document, for die-hards only."
1,Classification mania,"This book tries to classify and name things related to IS without giving them in depth (or any) explanations. The WCA classification pyramid goes all through the book. Typical example from p. 162 of the text: ""Communication systems: helps people work together by sharing information in many different forms; Typical user: Anyone who communicates with others including office workers, managers and professionals"" Are you looking for such deep insights???"
4,Information Systems: A Management Perspective,Good treatment of managerial techniques. Excellent case studies and thought provoking questions throughout each chapter. But the format of the book makes it hard to read.
4,Good Books,This book is very helpful for Information Management. It is explain more details in each parts of information system.
5,Very nice chair!,"We have had 2 of this chair for over 10 years of everyday use and has worked well. Had to replace upholstering at one point, but that was very easy.These are our everyday kitchen chairs. We liked them so much that looked for more and found them here on Amazon. Same style and color as the previous ones purchased at Costco. Delivery was quick and now have 4 new ones to match the old ones.Nice clean simple design but still classy. Works with any medium-dark wood furniture. Folds up flat if you need to for storage."
4,Good value,"I ordered this item to complement a set of card table chairs that I use for dining as they are convenient, sturdy, go with the table, & look good.The item is made by Stakmore, a company specializing in folding chairs, among others, and retailed by Wayfair (great service) via Amazon.The new chairs are also cherry, but appear to be lighter in color than my older ones. They are as sturdy, though chunkier-looking. The fabric seat is thicker & more comfortable than the older vinyl covered one, though I wish there were more colors (especially black)other than the off-white offered. Perhaps because the urn back appears to be the least popular model - though I think it is the most elegant.All in all a good product for the price."
5,A Well Deserved Documentary,"Simply summarized....... this is a well deserved documentary that finally gives attention and praise to the largely unknown artists of the 20s-40's who gave us the exciting artwork on the cover of all those thousands and thousands of Pulp covers during an interesting time in American History.Although usually disregarded as ""quickly generated art for hire"" during it's day and by the ""artsy fartsy gallery art world"".......... the fact is these artists produced more intense and enjoyable paintings than 90% of the stuff you see in art galleries today."
4,Pulp Art DVD,"I enjoyed this DVD a lot. I had read in books about the era of pulp art, but seeing it on video and hearing from the actual artists was very exciting and educational."
4,Mcilhatton,"Nice set by the great Christy Moore whose own words say it best:""McIlhatton you blurt we need you, cry a million shaking menWhere are your sacks of barley, will your likes be seen again?Heres a jig to the man and a reel to the drop and a swing to the girl he lovesMay your fiddle play and poitín cure your company up ""McIlhatton"
5,"Terri Defies Type - Country, Bluegrass, Folk? Doesn't matter","If you like folk, country, blue-grass, and are tired of singers that are ""promoted"" based on gloss or ""type"" - you'll love Terri. I first saw her in 2000 in Kerrville, Texas playing at a Saturday night get-together for riders in the Easter Hill Country bike ride. Terri captured the crowd with a combination of folk and country and her own ""secret ingredient"". I was hooked. This CD captures the best of a Terri Hendrix live performance - you can hear her humor and personality in songs like ""Don't Pet the Dog"" in a way no studio mix-synthesis with a studio-created performer could ever equal. Terri is a real artist who loves to perform and it comes across beautifully here. Don't expect gloss, just sheer fun."
2,Disappointing live effort,"Terri played in California this summer, and I saw her for the first time. I bought this CD at her concert, and I was disappointed that the album didn't capture the feeling I got at the show. That is to be expected, but this CD seems particularly unrepresentative of a Hendrix live performance. I bought another live album of hers and it was much better, still not the same experience, but closer than this."
3,"Unsatisfying Follow-Up to ""Places in Between""","As a Terri Hendrix admirer, I'm not sure why she chose to release this CD on the heels of her best work to date ""Places in Between"". It is produced by long-time Hendrix cohort and Tejas uber-producer Lloyd Maines, but I guess he just didn't have much to work with. The whole thing has a slapped-together homemade feel that some might find charming. I found it a disappointing follow-up. If you're not familiar with the work of this talented Texas songwriter/musician, pick up her earlier ""Terri Hendrix Live"", or better yet, go buy ""Places""."
4,A Good Track List,"The import version of Bananrama's Greatest Hits is slightly different than the original U.S. release. This version has a few extra tracks and doesn't include the cover of the Beatles song ""Help."" Banarama's Greatest Hits covers most of their popular singles from the first 10 years of their career. I would have liked to see less popular songs like ""More Than Physical"" make the track list but maybe one day their will be a Bananarama box set or something. But this set is awesome because it includes on of my favorite Bananarama songs ""Rough Justice."" The set opens with the mid 80's hit ""Venus."" Other popular songs on the set include ""Cruel Summer,"" ""I Heard A Rumor,"" and ""Robert Deniro's Waiting."" If you bought the U.S. version the import is worth checking out for the additional songs. The remixes are pretty cool."
4,Good 80's pop,"They're sassy, they're sexy, they're Bananarama. Though they were much more popular in England than they were in America, Bananarama had a sound all to their own in the muddy mixture of 80's dance music where the synthesizer ruled everything. Their harmonies worked well together in that their voices 'fit' each other. It's hard to describe, but you'd just have to call it magic."
3,whee - brings back memories - most of them bad,"Bananarama sux. It's true, none of them can carry a tune in a bucket. But truly, when you grow up listening to it, they immediately have this hold on you that you can't shake. So, it's ""my era"" music that I have to love to hate."
1,avoid these rotten bananas,"i would strongly plead with you to stay far away from this terrible album. i am convinced this has to be one of the lousiest compilations to be ever made by this outdated eighties band.songs like venus ,love in the first degree and shy boy sound dated and dreadful.avoid this stupid cd like the plague.my rating would be minus 10 stars."
5,"Easily, one of Karen's best CD's","Karen is a true virtuoso of the harp. Her renditions of ""Misty"", ""Somewhere in Time"", ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" and others are genuine works of art. She possesses a special talent to make her harp truely sing with joy. The arrangements are performed in a most enjoyable and soothing manner. I have listened to ""Harp by Candlelight"" and other CD's that Karen has produced for hours at a time and find them very calming and relaxing, and yes, inspiring. This is truely a fantastic album."
2,Good book for BW older versions,"The book gives very good step-by-step instructions, but this book is suitable only for those who use BW 3.5 and older versions. If you are using 7.x version, then it is not useful. So many people will benefit, if the authors update this book with BW 7.x version."
2,Old guide with outrageous price,"Several years ago I got some help from this book to understand the basic principles of BW. This book is currently very outdated. The outrageous part is that the publisher reprinted the book recently with a 50% increase in the price, without updating the content at all.If the authors publish a new edition, I'll be the first one to buy it."
2,Seriously outdated,"Man, you can't keep selling the same book forever and keep everyone satisfied. I liked the way they presented the idea of BW, but it was seriously outdated. They should make enhancements and upgrades atleast one in two years"
2,Navigation in 2.0 and nothing more...,"Disappointing in both structure and content; surprising thing, cosidering that the authors come with substantial credentials.It is more of an end-user self-training package targeting the individuals that want to memorize and troubleshoot their way through the setup rather that providing a step-by-step business case driven scenario.Unfortunately the release that make the subject of the book is already obsolete (well, this is not authors' fault).The CD-ROM attached to it is of little if any use;"
1,SAP(R) BW: A Step-by-Step Guide (Addison-Wesley Information Technology Series),This could have been a good book if it were binded properly. All the leaves in the book are flying out few days after receipt and usage.I am even contemplating returning it to you.Thank you.Emmanuel Badasu
4,Useful for Beginners,"As title suggests this book is step by step guide. I think author has assumed you already have knowledge of SAP BW concepts. It walks you through steps on how to create infocubes, load data and create queries and workbooks. Its EXTREMELY useful for people who are thinking to self-train themseleves in BW area . NOT meant for expereince BW people ..."
2,It based on BW2.0B and SAP R/3 4.0. and Really Step-by-Step.,"Currently BW 3.0B is used. But the book deal with BW 2.0B. Too late version. Also The book deal in step-by-step way, so It couldn't treat details.If you are really a novice, it will be good.But If you have any experience and want to know more advanced topics, It will be not a good book."
1,Wake Up,"People People People Please! If you have ever seen Rick James live you would know this is the real Rick James. The one that showed up for the show but forgot to bring the show with him. The band was cooking soul food while Rick was in the backstage eating. When he was on stage he was rushing through it all so he could get backstage to Mary Jane. I love Rick James but let's face it, this was one that should have got away. I was very upset buying this junk, it's not how I want to remmember Rick James. If he had spent more time on the set and actually sing his songs than jumping around and messing with the crowd, who you could feel they wanted Rick to cut to the chase and stop getting them up for a flash of James. ONE STAR!"
5,Pretty Rick,"Dvd live music, Rick James, dvd, funk, soul, It's good that Rick left a live dvd, he was one of kind, his funk is a motown funk but he made it his own. Love you Rick."
5,Buy this and Dave Chappelle DVD,"This is the DVD to keep next to your Dave Chappelle DVDs. Whether you have seen Rick James live in concert or the Dave Chappelle skits of Rick James or not, having both DVDs will truly make you appreciate Dave and Rick as geniuses. The quality of the Live Rick James show is actually pretty good considering that this was filmed in the early 1980s. It has an organic vividness compared to todays' digital sterility. This is Rick James AND his band at their peak. You know, when ""live show"" meant live band and not li(v)e prerecordings. When you see this footage of Rick James, you'll realize that in addition to watching a stellar performance collectors' item, Dave Chappelle really had him down to a T. DaLawn Simpson."
2,Evil triumphs????,"I think the book was well written, however I mistakenly thought the continuation of Jasmine's story would be about her being brought to task for her treachery, instead this story and subsequent sequels are all about Jasmine's triumph. I don't think she sincerely regretted the damage she caused in her friend's lives. I realize Jasmine and Alexis were never really friends, but after trying to destroy Kyla's marriage, she went after the Alexis' husband. I don't think she paid for her treachery and I don't believe she has a good heart, she just does what is beneficial to her. I couldn't get into reading anymore books that tried to show her in a good light and instead returned the rest of the ""Jasmine"" books unfinished to the library. These stories may appeal to some as they are all well written but they are just not for me."
4,VCM creates a character you can feel,"I must admit I haven't read the other VCM novel(s) featuring Jasmine but they are on my reading list. VCM crafts Jasmine in a way that is so intriguing that you can't help but hate to love her. From the twisted way she views being a Christian to the huge lies she tells to get what she thinks she wants, Jasmine is a flawed character that is totally likeable."
4,Shes baackkk!!!!,"Jasmine is back and in full effect. Must admit that this novel gets off to a slow start, but trust me when I tell you that once you get started you will find this page turner one that you cannot put down. Oh, what a tangled web she weaves, but will she finally gets the happiness she desperately seeks?"
3,Typical read,"This was another African-American book with a typical story line. We need more stimulating books besides, trying to get a man and live rich."
5,OMG-Jasmine!!,"4.5 stars. This is my second book by Ms. Murray and she has made a fan out of me. This is the first time in a long while an author has me talking to the book. Jasmine was just too much, but reading her story made me think of a lot situations where either you or your friends had gotten into something that just spiraled out of control. The only reason I knocked off half a star was because the book was slow getting started-but once it did, I had to pull an all-nighter to see how the story ended. Plus, there are quite a few coincidences-and I don't understand why Hosea talked like a cowboy with that 'darlin' stuff. He was straight out of New York. But it's all good. I wasn't disappointed in the ending, especially since I know the story is going to continue-and I can't wait."
3,surprise ending,"I bought this book because I expected it to be spiritually uplifting. It was not until I read the last few pages did I get the spiritual implications. I do recommend that you should know the story in the book of Hosea in the Old Testament to understand the message of God's grace, and forgiveness that is brought out at the end of this book. I found the book easy to read and look forward to reading ""Lady Jasmine"" by this author to see if forgiveness has changed Jasmine's life. This novel left me with a lot to think about in terms of living a godly life, being a good example, the importance being honest with our mates, and what it means to be a christian."
5,Bravo!!!,I just discovered Victoria Christopher Murray last week and thus far I've read two of her books..I am hooked. Ms. Murray is a very inspired writer...her writing style captivates you and leaves you with a pleasant ending and a smile on your face. This was the first book I read by Ms. Murray and I must say that I found it hard to put it down. The characters held very realistic. You'll enjoy this book...I guarantee you!
4,"Easy read, good plot with believable characters","The book was an enjoyable read, even though Jasmine wasn't my favorite character. It was a well written good fiction with a subtle direction toward Christian fiction. Although Jasmine was now a Christian, her old nature tiger stripes were still showing...."
5,Perfect Sequel!,This book was the perfect sequel to the book 'Temptation'. Jasmine still has not learned her lesson even though she truly loves Hosea. The lies continues and things appear to work in her favor for the moment anyway. I didn't care for Jasmine in the book 'Temptation' but I have warmed up to her in this sequel.
2,not as it seems,"Not a blanket for warmth, too thin. My nephew wanted it for the logo. Ok to cover the bed for looks, thats about all. Not worth the money, would have sent it back but nephew (16) said he wanted to keep it."
2,disappointing,"I bought this to try, since I love the Men's Envy. My vial was only a quarter full. I'm not one to bathe in perfumes, but with the total price, I was hoping to be able to wear this more than once to see if I like it or not."
4,Sea Change starring Tom Selleck,Tom SelleckTom reminds us once again why we like him so much with his low key easy performance as the troubled sheriff Jesse Stone. Another excellent outing in this serial role.
3,The Wizard of Oz,"John Updike famously said, ""Ted Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot August weekday, before a small crowd, when the only thing at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill."" That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. The supporting cast is top notch. Even a golden retriever and Ozzie Smith contribute in ""Sea Change""."
3,Scotts review,This movie is one of the jesse stone series and with every movie it just get's better the caractor of jesse stone has really got good and tom selleck has really developed him really good. The movie it's self was ok I still think that the first one stone cold and the third one death in paradise were better. Bu don't get me wrong the movie was pretty good for what they were going with. I just hope the make more.
1,Failure to deliver but charged!,Can not review since I never received the Video! I get no response from Amazon or DVDLegacy!
5,Jesse Stone: Sea of Change,A great movie. I cant get enough of these movies depicting a troubled cop turned troubled police chief. A must see movie.
4,Sea Change,"Jesse Stone: Sea ChangeThis is the fourth installment of the Jesse Stone series. I noticed a difference between the first three episodes and the last two. There is less character development even though the plot basis is good. The original characters don't seem to have as much exchange with Stone as in the original stories which made the two different plot lines meld easier. Still entertaining. Someone needs to tell Selleck to let the story flow, Robert Parker writes a good book. William Devane's portrayal is excellent."
5,Came real quick!,"the product arrived in great condition, we watched it that night. I couldn't believe the speed at which it came-I wish that 3rd party retailers for Amazon would ship their items with such enthusiasm. Amazon needs to instill a condition in regards to 3rd party retailers, that they must send their items (books & movies) using USPS Priority Mail-the cost that is charged is the same versus having to wait four weeks for your purchases. Not only using USPS Priority Mail to speed up delivery, using Priority Mail will ensure a much better chance of deliverys not getting lost. That has happened twice in regards to books I've purchased through 3rd party retailers. Amazon, please listen and please do something about shipping by 3rd party retailers who sell their products (books & movies) through you."
5,Jesse Stone: Sea Change,"Love the series, now I have all except the newest one that's not on dvd yet. Keep up the good work Tom, best thing on network tv in a while."
2,A failed experiment,"My wife has always been big on Christmas music, and I have always been a big fan of the Canadian Brass.We bought this CD with the expectation of being dazzled by the technical expertise of this group as they brought new dimensions to traditional Christmas carols and music.Instead we got a lousy CD of a children's choir backed up by pedestrian arrangements that could have been performed by a high school band of average competence.This CD isn't worth listening to, much less buying."
4,Perfect present for those into pioneer days and western history,"My brother bought this book for me while we were traveling across country from Ontario, Canada to Eugene, Oregon in 2001. We were in the basement underneath the St. Louis Arch Way to the West at the time. We indeed followed the Oregon trail on our cross country adventure by RV and used this book repeatedly as a guide. So when I found new friends here in Oregon from pioneer stock, I thought this book the perfect gift as a memento of our friendship. It's the perfect guide, gift and reference point."
3,Great book with fuzzy B&W pictures,"The author did a lot of research (as described in the book in length) traveling along OT in his jeep wagon. A good summary of general info for the beginners. The pictures and photos are inferior quality, only an experience photographer's eye can tell what they are."
3,Too much,"Unlike most of you reviewing I grew up as a southern girl and fell in love with the New York Yankees in the late fifties.I too think Torre has been one of their best managers although there have been others. The book was too much about Torre himself and not enough about my team.A little too much ego involved but would have to have it to be a Yankee manager or probably even a player.I have, over the years, read much about my team, and would not rate this as one of the best nor the worst. Just hope we win this year."
5,This music is out of this world!,"This album rocks and it rolls. If you like Primus, or Frank Zappa, or the Minutemen, or any great music that is just alittle outside of the mainstream, then you MUST get this CD. Be the first on your block to own the next new thing in strange and wonderful music."
3,Quality good but not as good as it used to be?,"I have been buying Mauviel copper products for many years. I prefer the brass handles because they look better to me than other styles. Pan is fine. Quality is fine. Works fine. Only issue is the craftsmanship on the eye hole in the handle is suboptimal. It has a rough edge as though they neglected to smooth it down properly. This is a very subtle defect, and I actually am annoyed that I have to waste time doing this review. But I felt morally obligated to say something. And I know Mauviel appreciates this feedback and will jump to action in their quality control section. (I will not say the name of the person who ""inspected"" it prior to letting it depart the factory. ha! risible!)"
5,AWESOME,"this cd is so awesome!! i love each and every song on it. when i feel like i need a boost, i pop the cd in the cd player and i feel so much better!i think anyone who is a fan of the WNBA needs this cd. Also, a portion of the procedes goes to NABCO so i would definatly buy it!!"
5,wonderful way of brewing full-leaf teas,"after using this tea maker for some years and, since some of my friends appreciate full-leaf teas as much as I do, I have even purchased it as a present from time to time. The Tea Control mechanism allows me to brew the tea at home and in my office without any spillage, avoiding an otherwise awkward handling of strainers or teabags. And the taste of my teas couldn't be better."
5,"A Simple, Stylish Way to Make Great Tea","As a coffee man, I have precious little experience in brewing good-tasting hot tea. Consequently, when I wanted to expand my hot beverage horizons a bit, I was left with a cup full of the bitter leaves of disappointment--using a regular teapot, I can't make a good cup to save my life. I bought this product from my local coffee shop to see if it could offer any help in the way of making tea.Immediately after removing the pot from the box, I could see evidence of quality. The glassware reminded me of the stuff we used in my organic chemistry lab, which is to say that I found it sturdy and aesthetically pleasing. Its instructions explained (in clear but translated English) a fairly simple process. The first pot of tea I made with it was as beautiful in taste as it was in color.I can't speak for experienced brewers, but for a novice to intermediate who wants to make the process a bit easier, this seems to be a good way to go."
2,Ideal on paper -- falls a little short in use,"Smart alternative press design, however, being that the steeped leaves remain in the pot after steeping it's important that it actually works. I don't know whether my product is defective or not, but after twisting the knob to end steeping I'll leave the pot with half left for maybe 30 minutes. When I return it almost always tastes oversteeped and bitter. I don't see any obvious leaks, but judging by the size of the small holes it doesn't seem like it would take much to leak into the main pot. This is disappointing because I see no obvious way for me to fix this by myself. I also emailed Finum for information on the kind of plastic they used for the infuser and never received a reply. This is my only teapot. I really tried to like it, but if it ruins your other cup, what's the use?edit: extremely disappointed, just made a full pot with the door closed. This doesn't work."
4,Perfect cup of tea,"This is the best brew method I've found, so far. Brew with a timer and you get perfection for white, green, black, and herbal teas. This is the answer for those seeking really good tea!"
2,Gimmick - cant get it open after use!,"1st time I used, it took a lot to,figure out how to get the lid off after making tea, to empty the leaves, wash, & re-use. The moving part has to be in JUST the right place. 2nd time I let it sit overnight & CANNOT get it open again. Because the moving piece has to be in exactly one place only, and some of the old tea leaves prevent it. Catch-22 - I can't open it as long as used leaves are gumming it up, but can't remove the leaves because I can't open it.It's going back, with the used leaves in it!"
5,best product on the line,best product on the market I've he did the boots and applied and that works well sworn by many people waterproof to the fullest hard product to find out side of Amazon priced right for more than enough ship very fast I love it
5,best leather care product I've used,"I regularly treat my leather boots with Sno-Seal to waterproof and condition the leather. It darkens the material slightly, but gives it a lovely weathered patina and improves the look over time, since scratches and scuffs disappear when it's reapplied."
4,Does a good job,"I applied two coats of SNO-SEAL, using a hairdryer on the outside. Since then, the wax has kept my boots dry and easy to clean. It's supposed to help extend the life of the leather as well, which would seem accurate so far.Keep in mind that this wax can darken and shine the leather several shades, depending on the finish."
5,Best stuff!,"Bought this sno-seal product to revive a tired, but well-made, pair of boots. They seemed worth saving. Applied easily, and the boots are better than ever. In fact I don't think they were this waterproof when they were new!"
5,Great stuff for leather,"This stuff is amazing for softening and conditioning stiff, new leather. Rub it into warmed leather, and after one or two treatments, it feels like it has been broken in by years of use. Does a great job of waterproofing too."
5,Awesome.,"I'll just tack this short review on to the plethora of positive feedback already here. I just put this stuff on my USA made Thorogood leather boots and wow they look nice. They got slightly darker (Which I like) and have a nice healthy feel to them. Sno-Seal is cheap, it's made in the USA like my boots, and by all indications it's going to work very well to keep water out."
1,Unfortunately I had problems with Rachmaninov,"Unfortunately I had problems with Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos 2 & 3 - Acoustic Reality Experience as the disc may have been under pressure in the transport for Brazil damaged it, the return is not feasible because of freight cost, I lost money ... .The other disk is OK Awake LiveI think the packaging should be improvedRegardsNeto"
5,this is a very relaxing CD that is highly recommended,"I recommend all jazz lover to listen to this inspiring CD. Especially from a long hard day, it will relax and sooth the mind into another planet, (if you will)."
5,dense and tasty,"Bought two of these orders at different times. Very scrumptious snack. Not too much sugar and enought fruit to where you can taste it. The whole wheat action makes it feel and taste quite good. As there were so many packages/bars in one order, I lost count of the number of times I was able to go to the box and inhale again. They were so good, that I found myself eating quite a few-read that as half or most of a pkg-when I was hungry. Not dry, so I didn't find myself lunging for a glass of milk, though it was superb to rinse down one to make room for another. Like Mom taught me: ""Life is uncertain, eat dessert first""."
3,Not like the others,"This book is not like the other Kim White books I've read. This one isn't as good of a read. I'm really dragging through this one. Usually it takes me 1-2 days to get through a really good book, and this one is taking me forever. I gave it a three just because, but it's not a must read over and over again type book."
2,poor construction,"It is very bright as advertised, but the construction was poor. Almost immediately the rubber grommet and on/off switch became ensnared and after resetting several times the grommet was removed. This rendered the light usable for a very brief period until it began to short circuit."
2,Almost total junk,"This flashlight didn't quit completely, but it goes really dim regularly. I changed the batteries twice, but got no improvement. It usually starts working again with a few bashes in the palm of my hand...for a while."
2,Not really reliable,"The light output is great, at first, but this product drains AAA batteries pretty quickly; something LED's are not supposed to do. However, my main complaint is that the battery cartridge moves around within the housing, causing the light to flicker, dim, and flat go out. I have to shake the flashlight around to make the light come back on. This is a definite design flaw. I don't understand why the designers didn't use a ""C"" cell size battery rather than 3 triple A batteries."
1,DANGER: Contains LEAD!,"This flashlight contains LEAD that the printed warning on the package claims will get on you with normal use. AMAZON SHOULD STOP SELLING THIS!The Warning reads:""WARNING, Always wear ANSI approved safety goggles when using this product. Before using this product, The user should read the operating instructions to understand everything about this product. Normal everyday use of this product is likely to expose the user to dust and microscopic particles containing lead and other chemicals known in the State Of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm. Always wear the appropriate clothing and safety equipment when operating this product. Wash hand thoroughly after the use and handling of this product."""
2,Not reliable,While this little flashlight IS very bright at times... right away it started dimming to not very bright at all. Then it would be fine for a few minutes. Then dim a few minutes. It was annoying and interfered with the task I was trying to accomplish. I tried replacing the batteries but to no avail. I end up whacking it against my hand to get it to go bright again. Very disappointed.
1,Did not meet my expectations.,"My expectations of a light are basic. Push the button and it turns on, nothing above that. So it is a pretty sorry state when this light could not live up to this basic criteria.Out of the package, I installed the 3 AAA batteries, hit the switch and nothing happened. I changed them out for three of my own batteries with the same result.Fortunately this failed right out of the package. It would have been much worse if it had failed in the field.Don't bother."
2,most of the led's work,"Much brighter than the 9 led model, but about a third of the 28 don't work --quality reminds me of Christmas tree lights. Cheap, but poor wiring quality.The case is pretty good, surprisingly."
1,Worst LED Flashlight Ever Purchased,"Unfortunately, this flashlight periodically blinked using batteries right out of the box. Moreover, it fits very poorly in its case and has an annoying metallic smell, which probably will go away over time. It does, however, provide lots of intense light for its size. Nevertheless, very disappointed."
3,MADE IN CHINA,"DISAPPOINTED IN THE FACT THAT THESE LIGHTS ARE MADE IN CHINA. BAD MOVE AMAZON. I DONT LIKE YOU AS MUCH AS I DID BE I BOUGHT THESE, BUT I GUESS I SHOULD OF KNOWN...CANT TRUST ANYONE ANYMORE. FROM NOW ON I WILL ASK WHERE THE PRODUCT IS MADE, AND, IF IT ISNT MADE HERE(USA) THEN U KNOW WHAT U CAN DO WITH IT......THANK YOU,A CONCERNED US CITIZEN, DENNIS"
5,"Small, yet powerful, flashlight","A very small, yet powerful, flashlight which can be used for a variety of situations."
2,Ok if you only need it for a few months or so.,"I bought mine over a year ago. The having to tap it problem that others mention is real, and it gets worse as the months go by. Finally, mine just quit working, a little over a year after I first used it. I will not buy another one."
2,Flashlight seems good but read Warning on package,Here is the Warning printed on back of the package.--Warning--Always wear ANSI approved safety Goggles when using this product. Normal everyday use is likely to expose the user to particals containing lead and other chemicals.... Always wear appropriate clothing and safety equipment.... Wash hands thoroughly after using this product.Reading this warning has tainted the flashlight for me and I'm thinking of returning it.
3,"Great Small Light, But for Real Light Buy the 100 LED Version","Look for the 100 LED flashlight here on Amazon. Yes, it is larger and it costs more, but you won't regret it. Read my review before buying the 100 LED flashlight. But if you don't need very much light and cost is a primary consideration, this 28 LED version is marginally adequate. I've noticed problems at times with flikering light and that is because the terminals inside the light tarnish making for an intermittent situation that is rectified by rotating the battery compartment while pressing it against the LED bulb assembly. And rotate the batteries while inserted to clean the surfaces. It doesn't happen often."
3,average,"I was very excited about the idea of ""28"" LED lights...but apparently at least 5 were not working when I first used it...now I think there are 8 already that are not working...But it still works :)..."
3,Hmmmm - a little confusing,"Well, I had to try it. It is bright. But, not as bright as several single LED flashlights I have purchased. Oh, well, from the price I knew it was too good to be true. It is a nice package, fits the hand well, and the switch seems reliable. Good deal overall, I guess."
4,Super Bight LED,"The picture doesn't show the actual size of the flashlight, so I assumed it would be at least 6-8 inches in length because of the description. It is only about 4"" in length but does cast a bright light."
4,Nice little light,"Very bright compared to the ones I have had before. I am a firefighter and it comes in very handy. Very nice except for the fact mine has a grounding problem sometimes and I have to twist it to get it to come back on. I also love the carry pouch it comes with. I can keep it on my belt instead of my pocket. Haven't had it long term yet, but still satisfied since I got it for $10.99 when they go for $29.99(might be a reason). If it's still $10.99, I would recommend it."
5,It Lights Up My Life,"So small, you could almost hide it in your hand. So powerful, it could light up a stadium ... well a small stadium .... well maybe a large room. Anyway, this is a cool flashlight, very bright, and a really good value."
1,Poor Quality Control,Item was delivered quickly enough. But the battery holder inside the unit was missing. Item will not function without it. Much like a car without a gas pedal. Poor quality control.
1,Runs batteries down just sitting on the shelf.,"After the first time this happened, I replaced the batteries which were new and it didn't work a couple weeks later when I tried to use it again."
2,so so,This flashlight looked like a great idea but was recieved broken and was not worth paying shipping to send back so have no idea how it works. I do not believe I would purchase this again unless they will pay return shipping if broken.
4,Connection problem is common with any flashlight,"Is all you have to do is bend the little medal piece to hold the battery in place better. I had to do the same thing to my doorbell last week. Anything that takes batteries sometimes needs this type of adjustment. My boss ordered a handful of these flashlights. He told me one wouldn't work. I just adjusted the metal pieces that surround the battery. Presto, no problem. Works like magic."
2,Just Ok,"This does not really give you much more light than than the 9 led version. The other problem is that it sometimes works and sometimes does not. There is a connection problem. This has been noted by some others here as well. If you will rely on this for emergency situations, you might want to look at other models.Interestingly, the cheaper 9 led version works much better."
1,Would be great - if it worked more than 10% of the time. Found a fix!,"Great idea, even a great design - but obviously poorly manufactured. The battery connections are miserable and the darned thing just doesn't work most of the time. Pretty useless if it's not dependable and you spend have the time messing with the battery cover. Didn't save the pkg, so I can't send it back... but I have put Neiko on my no buy list.updated review - we put a 1/8"" flat washer in the ""head"" area of the flashlight just before dropping in the battery pack. It sits in the little area where the pointy end of the battery pack goes. It makes contact all the time now where it needs to. All of ours have worked just fine since we did this."
2,"When it works, its great.","This is a great little flashlight, when its working at full capacity. I keep it in my night stand for middle of the night investigations, etc. The problem is that I've noticed in the last year or so since I've owned it, that it starts to ""flicker"", as if something is coming loose inside. It has had a pretty pampered life, getting used once a month for only a few moments at a time, so abuse is certainly not the cause.I would not buy it again."
2,Would be nice if it stayed bright,"My first issue with this flashlight is that after installing batteries, it would not turn on. I checked to make sure the batteries were in correctly which they were and after a few shakes and taps it lit up. Seemed nice at first, very bright and a nice cone of light. Then it started to dim and it appeard half the LED's were not working. Another tap and they lit back up but then continued to dim or flicker. Seems like pretty poor quality to me as some other reviewers have the same issues. I would not recommend this flashlight."
2,Neiko Super Bright 28-LED Aluminum Flashlight,"I bought this aluminum flashlight thinking that it would be fairly heavy duty. The light flickers dim to bright with almost every movement, so there isn't a steady bright light. When it is bright it is great. Not very good quality for a Neiko."
4,p funk is all over this,"you like those crazy funkadelic guitar solos get this eric plays with the p funk so you know he's a hella axeman to even funk with michael hampton, blackbyrd, and lige curry anyway my favorite track is alien love wuith george clinton and belita woods man they talk crazy on this here meeting aliens and I think getting intimate with one crazy man."
1,Unreadable,"I found this book to be unreadable. Unless you have a very detailed knowledge of the culture and history of the area, the essays will be impossible to understand. I also found the translation odd. I think the translator may not be a native English speaker. This may have contributed to my inability to follow the essays."
2,Fairy Tale,"A woman wants to have a child, but she does not have one. One day, a fairy gives the woman a seed. The woman planted the seed, and it grew. It turned into a beautiful flower, and inside the flower was a girl. The girl was about as big as a thumb, so the woman called her Thumbelina. Thumbelina was taken by a toad and placed on a lily pad. The toad wanted Thumbelina to marry his son, but Thumbelina didn't like the toad. As the days go by, stuck in a forest all alone, Thumbelina was not happy.This story, like many other fairy tales, has a happy ending. If you like happy endings, you will enjoy this story."
5,"excellent, unexpected and untempted by cliches","this was a truly spectacular book, I am amazed to see it in mass market paperback and now out of print. This is certainly not a typical mass produced fun but forgetable thriller...It is absolutly careful and tight in every detail, Kate Morgenroth shows amazing control- complete intellectual genius free from the temptations of cliche and laziness, or any sort of moral indulgance. This is simply amazing."
1,Featherweight and pointless,"I just can't understand the stellar reviews this novel(la) is getting. I bought it on the basis of a glowing Entertainment Weekly review and found it to be thin and unrewarding. What other reviewers have described as ""taut"" and ""fast-paced,"" I describe as shallow. The characters are poorly drawn caricatures, and I never really understoood what motivated them. There was a tiny plot twist at the end that was interesting but the fate of the main character was telegraphed like a falling anvil. The book was supposed to plumb the dark side of violence and gore but the author usually chickened out. Thank god B. Dalton has a guaranteed read policy, there is no way I'm paying 20$ for a hard cover book that I hated. Back it goes!"
1,Too much disbelief to suspend,"Two examples: ""Trexler got into CIA headquarters on the strength of his federal ID."" And later, two law enforcement officers talking-- ""You know the saying."" ""What?"" ""Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades."" ""No, I hadn't heard that."" [Anyone need to read further?]"
1,Writing a script would have saved her the trouble,"Ugh! What a trite book! It was literally like reading a script. Evidently Morgenroth had intended to write a novel that would receive offers from every film producer in Hollywood. Yes, there are some exciting and intense moments when Merec is shown just how evil he could be, but not enough to make it exciting or likeable. There isn't a spark of originality in the plot. There's no literary merit. None.May I suggest a dark novel that is thought provoking and intense? Try Criminals by Margot Livesey. I highly advice you to skip this one -- unless you want to read a script disguised as a novel."
2,"no service, very basic translation","The device may be convenient in some cases, although looks very overpriced. Very simple/literal translation. However when, after a year, problems started - they told that they don't repair and the only option is to buy new one (well, replace for $400)."
3,"ECTACO ER-800, it's OK","ER-800 is probably one of the better translators available. This model will translate a whole paragraph. I married a Russian speaking lady and most times it is our only means of communication. The quality of the translation is sometimes a big problem, because it doesn't always give you a answer that makes any sense and sometimes it causes more problems than it solves, but without the human factor being involved in the translation i suppose it is usually acceptable. Quite often it is possible to figure out the basic idea of the translation and you get an idea of what the other person is trying to tell you. I would say that about 75 percent of the time the translation is good enough to understand completely, which is probably as good as the technology is at this point in time. Overall I would say that if you need to be able to converse with Russian speakers this is one of the better choices that is available."
4,Great Music; Lousy Digital Transfer,"This is perhaps Cal and Vince's best music on record. And if you find a vinyl copy of this, new or old pressing, (mono is best) grab it. Unfortunately when he reached the point of transferring this from analogue to digital, Phil Lancie grabbed a mono tape and split it creating a muddled stereo transfer. Big goof was created. Consequently, one hears the group only through right speaker and an echo of same through the left. It's mud. Check out your buddie's vinyl of this. It is music made in heaven at the Blackhawk. The titles Land's End, When the Sun Comes Out, and the tribute to MJQ are so fine and you'll groove on Lover Come Back to Me. Buy all their stuff. No regrets."
2,CAUTION!,"Despite the name, this book is not about cunnilingus or fellatio. In fact, in a book titled ""Oral Sex"" those subjects are hardly mentioned.As you can see by the section ""What Do They Ultimately Buy?"", most people who click on this page buy some other book. You should, too."
5,"fascinating reflections on other authors, writing, and his memoirs","Topics include: On the motion Picture The Grapes of Wrath, on religion and psychoanalysis, toward a definition of the novel, difficulties with my play, Faulkner, Henry James, Kierkegaard, Norton Lectures, Stendhal, quite a lot of thought about Poe, Melville, Dr. Schweitzer, Woollcott, Genet, science fiction, Whitman and the breakdown of love, zen, the Alcestiad, the dream-process in literature. 354 pages, thoroughly indexed."
5,A fighting game for the RPG fan!!,"As a RPG fan I love playing Final Fantasy,Fire Emblem, ect...Im not really skilled at fighting games. But this game is very simple and fun to play! There are no 85 button combos to pull off. There are only a few button combos and the left and right triggers. Ths music is really cool and the anime style fighters are awesome!! This is the best fighting game of any system, xbox or ps2 have no fighting games this good. for the price go ahead and get it. You'll love it."
2,"Choppy-Choppy, So Sloppy","Since discovering ""Street Fighter Alpha 3"" for the Game Boy Advance, I decided to find out how other fighting franchises stack up on the handheld. So far, this game ranks at the bottom of the pile. Besides the AI being such a joke that you can literally beat it by mashing just one button, the music and sound in ""Guilty Gear X"" simply DOES NOT ROCK!All the GG fighters retain all their moves and animations, though their character sprites are way too small and rough. The multiple game modes and unlockables help to kill time and I suppose that counts for something (you get the best workout in Practice Mode). Still, unlike SFA3 and other GBA fighters, the developers of GGX seemed to think that oversimplified graphics, sound and gameplay makes an enjoyable GBA game; the irony!This game is rated T for Teen: Violence."
1,"""Game Boy"" inferior hardware","Game Boy anything will leave you wishing you got a system that has more fire power. But, until nintendo made the 3DS, the handhelds available were not up to par. Super street fighter 4 for the 3ds is the only thing nintendo ever had to rival other systems in terms of portable fighting games......the rest just SUCK!And this guilty gear will show you what i am talking about."
3,"Great DVD, with one exception","This would have gotten 5 stars,but you have to click on each segment of the DVD to watch it. Kind of annoying!"
2,DO NOT BUY,i bought this game thinking i was going to do insane stunts and tricks. i was wrong. you cant do any tricks. all you can do is the one button ones. if you try to do a trick that uses multiple buttons it doesnt work and does the trick of the first button you press. the racing in this game is good. if you want an mx racing sim then this is the game for you. if you want to bust out insane eyepopping stunts then i would suggest waiting for freekstyle to come out which is what im doing.
2,MX Superfly - Really Disappointing,I couldn't wait for this game to come out; I thought it would be awesome. Once I played it I was really disappointed. You can't do any tricks. The only ones I've been able to pull off are the one button ones. If you try to do a trick that uses multiple buttons it just does the trick of the first button. And if you repeat a trick you get penalized like 80% of the points. The racing mode is fun and challenging but I bought the game to bust out eye-popping tricks. The mini games are so easy that they're boring. You can't do freestyle mode because you can't do any tricks. It is also very hard to accelerate. It you want a motocross game to race then this is the game for you. If you want a motocross game to bust out insane moves I would suggest waiting for Freekstyle to come out. From what I've read it is pretty much SSX Tricky on motocross bikes.
2,Hm...,"I am not as excited about this book as I was others. This one was okay, it just didn't have that special I-am-a-writer-you-can't-copy-my-style touch if you know what I mean. It was like a totally different writer wrote the book, you know? If u don't u can check it out at your library for yourself-but beware! I would rather you read it before you buy it. You might be disappointed a little bit. I was."
2,review,"IF you also buy a micrometer, then you don't really need this case. Starrett sends their VERY FINE TOOLS in a very useful plastic case. This case would feel more at home on a desk than on a workbench. IMO"
3,The Scent was not as I expected,"The Seller did a FANTASTIC job and I give them 5 STARS! Prompt service, high shipping quality! The 3 star rating is for the product itself. I did not like the smell of the oil. I don't know if it's the base oil used or the other fragrances added to the freesia but, it was not what I expected."
3,"Loved the concept, not the look","I enjoyed reading this book with my son. The ideas of different time zones and cultures would be fun to discuss as he gets older. And I think it was well-written -- the words are sweet and simple. However, I'm just not a fan of the illustrator's style of painting people. For me, it was a bit ""rough"" or primitive. I'm not saying the painter doesn't have talent. The colors and detail were fun; it's just not my favorite. Some people will like this aesthetic, and there's nothing wrong with that. Liking or disliking the art in picture books is subjective, and that's fine. Personally, I would get this from the library again, but would not add it to our permanent collection unless he really expresses a love for it."
4,Not just an album,"This is actually a comicbook that comes with the Hey / Mum CD in the back of it. The music is really good, the comic art is dream like. There's a neat little music video on the CD as well. My only complaint is that it's so short. I was hoping for more tracks, but there's just one from Hey, and one from Mum. Never heard Mum do a french song before, it's pretty cool."
3,Decent Internet Security,"This application works well. There one process, occasionally operating, that will consume all of your systems CPU cycles.... I never did learn how to restrict the process to my system disk or get it to idle when I wanted to use the machine (the process did idle but in a way that interfered with me using the computer). The interfering process scanns hard disks; some times I have 700GB of data storage disks attached. Disk scanning goes on for hours and hours with so much disk space to scan. A fix is to use a task monitoring program and set the processes priority to ""below normal""; this freed the machine for my use."
5,Real Jam,"This sets a standard for what jams and preserves ought to be like.Quality, quality, quality.The marmalade is also superb."
1,Below average at best,"I was excited when I saw this game for only five dollars at the store however this game is exactly the title for this review. It is riddled with gramatical errors that are derived from poor Japanese to English translation. I am also not a fan of the Japanamation characters. It is also very difficult to move items once you purchase them in order to build an office. This game is seemingly stolen from the other fun Tycoon games ( golf, roller coaster) and put in a quick, cheap format. I have played this game once and never looked back. I would not suggest you losing your money on this one."
3,false ad,This was listed as Season 1 of the show. It isn't. It's just the first 12 episodes of the show & is shown in order.
1,Beautiful but NOT FUNNY and TOUCHING as the original movies produced in the 1950s,"These short movies look beautiful and more modern than the original ones produced in the 1950s. However, the old ones are much funnier and more touching.This DVD contains 12 episodes. They are: Accidental Hero, Bully For You, Disarmed and Dangerous, Dragon Quest, Fang Decay, Frankenleftovers, Grimly Day, Opposite Day, Ra-minator, Rich Kid Ra, Scare Day, Weekend at Bunny's.In short, this DVD is worth borrowing but not purchasing.I own the old Casper movies on 4 DVDs. They are titled Best of Casper vol. 1, Best of Casper vol. 2, Casper and Wendy - Scare Up Some Fun, Casper Trick Or Treat. Each contains 12 episodes. The have brought me countless humorous times and warm feeling."
5,"Great explanations, many exercises, answer key","As a teacher of many grade levels and English fluency levels, I found this book very useful. It has perhaps the best explanation I've read on ""perfect"" tenses. My ESL student couldn't understand why he should use a simple past tense versus a present perfect tense, and this book helped him.The book features many useful charts on major and minor grammar topics. I find the charts very effective and easy to learn and teach. There are also plenty of exercises in this book, too.I've used the book with 5th graders, 12th graders, and ESL adults. I highly recommend it. It's very well organized and quick, quick, quick to use in the classroom."
4,"Good book, good practice",The book is easy to understand. A lot of exercises to practice. I just want to have the answers at the end to compare and correct my work. But that's fine. It's been really usefull in my English classes.
5,satisfied customer,I was happy with the content of the book as well as the prompt service. THe price is fair as well.
4,"Solid, old-fashioned","Sheffield's work reminds me of the hard-science multi-plot future history works of the writers of the 50s and early 60s. The work has very much the feel of a serialized sci fi mag piece from Astounding or some such. The usual ingredients are there--a collection of disparate characters enmeshed in a handful of subplots, the mildly dystopian but recognizable earth of fifty years hence, a global threat, eccentric yet capable minds that work to solve it, and, finally, not one but two little puzzle mysteries, with punch line endings to both inquiries. Sheffield's plotting is a real strength; the characterization is a bit pat. I recommend this one, though, as the central dilemma is compelling, and the book lacks the gratuitious glandular or violent juvenalia which infects so many more modern sci fis. This is a fun afternoon, rather than an epic voyage, but not every unmanned satellite can discover a new universe...."
3,"3 words: Formula, Formula, Formula!","This was a good brain candy, beach read. The characters were SOOOOO written for a movie. The ending was out of left field, concepts that weren't explored at all (and not earth-shattering ones that i would sit and contemplate either). Both the main and 2ndary endings were pulled out of some hole the universe, I know not where. There is so much better hard sci-fi out there.Try Larry Niven, Stephen Baxter (Flux was strange but the science was thouroughly explored!) and many others if you want hard sci-fi. If you want a 2nd rate murder mystery where you are told key clues AS they are confronting the culprit w/ a little science thrown in, this is for you."
3,Standard Sheffield in my opinion,"I like his books for what they are - a scifi that I can pick up when I want. It has enough science to keep me interested and the characters are believable enough. There were times I wasn't sure I would make it through the 500 pages, but the flow is fairly even which helps. In short, something has caused a nearby star to go supernova and spew a jet of high energy particles at Earth. An orbiting space city has little time to create a defensive shield. The B Plot is that there are murders happening on the space city. Honestly - the two plots have absolutely nothing to do with one another and some plot elements that seem really significant up front turn out to be nothing in the end. But if you read a lot of paperback scifi and want some real astrophysics in it (it's not quite a hard scifi though), this will do."
4,Great Biblical academic study,"As a Christian financial advisor, this is a great book to help me understand the Bible's view of money. I wish to help my clients see money not as an end goal but as a tool to use to spread God's kingdom. This book is a great tool to help me understand those Biblical principles. The writing is very thorough and academic and may be dry to the common layman, and not every chapter is very applicable on a daily basis, but that really isn't the point of the book. For someone who wants to understand the overall view of money in the Bible, this would be a valuable reference."
3,"Dry, not terribly persuasive","I was looking for a book that researched the entire Bible on the issue of possessions. This met that bill, but it was short on analysis. I am glad I read this book, but it is pretty dry......and therefore not very persuasive or inspiring."
5,Excellent Shoe,My 10 year old daughter loves these shoes. Swears they are the most comfortable pair she owns. I have to admit they are the only ones at her school and everyone compliments her.
5,My daughter loves these sneakers,"My Daughter just loves these sneakers! As all 6yr olds would say,""I can run faster, and jump higher!!"" The sneakers seem to be well made, and hold up well!"
4,Nice glove!,"Received glove very promtly and in perfect condition. Great quality Mizuno leather, as it feels soft and top notch. Almost broken in right out of the bag. Only rating it 4 stars because I havent used it yet."
1,YUCK!,"It smells kind of funny, but that's the least of it. This stuff made my hair greasy and oily. It's sort of like putting a lot of gel or pommade in your hair when its dry. It just goops up. I even tried brushing it out. Not good. Am I missing something? Should I rinse it out?"
3,Not very big.,Doesn't hold that much but is nice for the can holders. Wish it held more. Like to float it in the pool or lake. Does away with needing a boat *itch to refresh beverages.
1,Doesn't float outside of the pool,"Just something to keep in mind: If you want to use this even on a leisurely kayak trip, be prepared for it to sink. There's a 'cover' on the bottom that you are suppose to open and put ice in... but guess what... if there's a hole in the bottom, it won't float, unless you never move it. Probably great for just sitting in the pool or tied to a dock, but if you want it for other purposes (like tubing or kayaking), I'd look for a product that doesn't have a big hole in the bottom."
5,Works great!,"I have no idea what these other guys are talking about in their reviews. I bought this as a gift for a some friends last year, and we had an opportunity to use it first hand today. We had 6 bottles in the holders PLUS another 6 pack in the cooler PLUS ice in the cooler... floated like a CHAMP, didn't spill a drop."
4,Wilshire Boulevard: Grand Concourse of Los Angeles,"I purchased this book because I had seen one before. I have really enjoyed reading about the history of Wilshire Boulevard and Los Angeles, and have learned very interesting information about the way this special street started and the buildings (unfortunately some are no longer here) that made it such a grand avenue."
1,Not high impact plastic!,"This holster claimed high impact plastic, but the first time I placed it on my side the clip broke off from the back.It litteraly fell apart in my hand, and the shipping cost was more than the holster itself so I did not return it.I will not get anymore one dollar holsters."
1,What?!?!?!,"It is a good thing I rented this so-called ""game"". The levels put up no challenge for me. Lilo's attacks consist of a stupid thing called Voodoo and a Bum Bounce. Yep, she puts up a glowy thing and bounces her butt all over the place. It is really fun. NOT. Stitch can spin around and also do a Bum Bounce. I think they copied Crash Bandicoot's signature spin move. I don't remember Stitch spinning around or missing boxes with his behind. The graphics look like something they got out of the trash can and the music is dumb. Honestly, they could make something in this game right. But, they did not."
2,Lilo and Stich,JUNE23 2002 The Levels tohard. They only give you three chaces.One level I could not find the last record.
5,Fabulous Fantasy,I picked this book up on a reccomendation and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was! An urban fatasy that is well writen and a truly enjoyable read.
3,"OK, but not something I'd read again.","Some good writing interspersed with long boring sections of ""deep and meaningful"" lyrics when then band plays. Some of the sections were so slow I skipped over them-and didn't miss anything.Don't know that I'd read more by this author."
5,My Favorite Book,"The first time I read this book, I think I must have been about twelve or thirteen years old. I liked fairytales, I always had, and I really liked the fantasy genre, but this book changed my life. I had never imagined magic being real before. I had never imagined that Faerie could intersect with the modern world, or that an eighties punk rocker could be as powerful as an old Irish bard. The characters are almost real to me, because they're people I grew up with. The Phouka, with his odd way of speaking and his smart-alek mouth, was my first love. Eddi McCandry seemed powerful and glamourous and very, very human. I am now twenty-nine years old, and when I am sad I pick this book back up to remind me that somewhere in Minnesota, the courts of Faerie may still be as strong as they were in The Ballad of Tam Lin. If you haven't read this book yet, pick it up. It may be old-fashioned now, but I hope you find in it the same wonder I did."
5,What a great book!,"Throughout War For the Oaks, Bull displays a thorough knowledge of British / Celtic folklore and folk music, and the music culture of modern Minneapolis. Manages to be both stylish and engaging. One of her best, and one of the best modern fantasies ever."
5,Stands up on Re-Read,"I am basing this review on a re-read, in the Kindle edition, of a book I first read when it first came out. It is as good as I remembered it, perhaps better. It has music, magic, love and struggle and the best rock band we will never get to hear. I haven't gone to concerts much lately as I get older and ticket prices get higher but I would pay top money to hear Eddi and the Fey play anywhere and anytime. That five-star rating up there is solid, you will see no disclaimers like ""well, it isn't _Kim_ and _It Isn't Lord of the Rings_ Well, it isn't. It's _War for the Oaks_ and as good a book as one could ever want.Thank you, Emma Bull, thank you."
3,slow and pondering,"The premise of this book is great but the writer doesn't get to it until past the middle of the book. Many pages are spent describing the mundane daily life of the main character. Most of the book is spent arguing with the main character's fairy bodyguard and the band members. The bad guys are constantly talked about but you never get any sense that they are any kind of a threat until too late in the book. You would think that the action could have been brought in sooner or 1/3 of the book could have been cut out. To me, and of course i'm just one reader, the book is only a set up to get the two main characters to be involved with each other. This could also have been done sooner and it would have complicated the plot and made it more interesting."
3,Very good beginning,"So I picked up this book because someone on Amazon said it was better then War of the flowers. Same idea but better, so I decided to give it a chance. The characters were very interesting especially the Phouka. The main character was descent and I usually like reading about reluctant heroes. Anyway, the beginning was so much fun and the Phouka was so entertaining. About halfway through the book it started to get worse. It was really good and then it became so sappy. Even the character I liked a lot became sappy. I finished the book disappointed. Oh and the ending was dumb. I gave it three stars because the first half of the book was really good."
2,Seriously?,"WOW... um ok... what to say about this book. I enjoyed the characters and I enjoyed reading about the growing relationship between the characters but was it really necessary to make her a bit of a hoe? Between the ex, the fling, and the true love - this girl is doing half the male characters in the book! Ok, that isnt even my largest complaint. The band? Really? It was soooooo cheesy! It was like a dance off with cover bands! NO THANK YOU! Next book please."
4,Telefuncun Recordings From the Past.,"It is good news that a Telefuncun legacy series is being released. In the era of 78s, Telefuncun recordings were regarded as something special. Recording techniques seemed to be in a class of their own, being especially favourable to singers.Hilde Konetzni (1905-1980) and Helge Roswaenge (1897-1972) were singers I heard in opera in Vienna. Konetzni made 8 records for Telefuncun in the 1937 - operatic arias with especially fine accompaniments conducted by Dr Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt. Only four are included here, although there is room for the CD to accommodate more of them. Roswaenge's were made a few years earlier and are remarkable more for spirited singing than for beauty of voice.Everything is sung in German. Restorations and transfers are excellent. Enriching the package, which also includes several rather dim photographs, are notes provided by the authority on opera singers on record, John Steane."
2,A sadly compiled story with little plot,"I kept reading this book waiting for it to get better. It didn't. I only continued reading to find out if she found her sisters, only to learn this was a trilogy, (It was not marked on the cover as such) The entire story could have been summed up in two pages if you had taken out all the sex scenes. The major was a jerk and Lily was a bit too wanton. A major disappointment for LLM readers."
2,Lily and the Major,"I have read a LOT of Linda Lael Miller books, and I have to say this is not one of my favorites. This book could have used more story substance."
2,i really disliked this story,"When The Major want to convince Lily of anything he has to sleep with her at 1st it was fun but after it was a lot and not romantic in the least and lily loved him and she was with a baby and still no for the marriage even though she agreed in the end after she thought about it and she said ,she can't have her dreams when she is married but she did . i'd advise u not to waste ur time reading this story , there are other stories for Linda which were much better !"
4,Exciting story,"Something happening every minute. Interest in details about homesteading in the west. It 's a long story, so be sure you have plenty of time. A good lesson for us about how hard women had to fight for whatever they wanted and what they had to do to stay alive."
2,Dissappointed,The writing seemed to fall flat. Unbelievable character actions/development. Couldn't get more than halfway through and I'm a dedicated reader. I've read one of the other trilogy books and really enjoyed it so I was surprised by this one being rather flat.
5,Wonderful,Love Linda Lael Miller's books. Keeps you rivited from begining to end..I can not wait for her new titles to come out
4,Magic Mania!,"The amount of magic covered in this book is astonishing, a wide range of topics, that do not necasserily use sleight of hand.A great book to turn an ammateur into a proffesional. Loads of proffesional techniques are covered and the language, though perhaps a little dated is stil easily understood. The odd reference to half pennies reveals it's age, but it truly is an incredible buy at great value...... if you've ever been interested in magic then this is a must buy"
2,Hover-Hippo,"It's not the worst combat flight sim out there, or the best. The missions have a nice logic to them and learning to control your dropship properly takes practice- she's a slippery hippo. The maps are large and have a good sense of scale.That being said, the graphics are unpolished and ugly, which creates a BIG problem for a flight sim, in that it's hard to gauge distance because the terrain textures are uniformly flat and boring.The audio is surpisingly good. The com chatter and background music are exceptional.If the developers had had another few months to touch this game up it might've been an excellent outing. As it is, strategy minded flight-sim enthusiasts only need apply.This is not a game you want to spend over 10 dollars for, in my opinion."
2,Just another Bomberman Game,"Bomberman Generation is just another bomberman game. More of the same childish graphics, cheap bosses, and sup par multiplayer. ..."
4,Fun Multiplayer for Casual Gamers,"As a budget priced title (now), I think the game is great for multiplayer for casual gamers or non-hard-core gamers. I find it highly replayable and find myself playing multiplayer with a casual gamer frequently. It is easy for casual gamers to pick up and plenty of strategy for other gamers on the mulitiplayer. It is very basic, the way you can play tetris over and over. I like the short games and tournaments. The computer AI is decent and can be adjusted to easy/normal/hard.The single player was very bizaar. Not familiar with bomberman single player, it started out looking and playing like a game for 2-year olds, but was actually quite challenging later that probably would be very tough for casual gamers. The voice acting was so oddly paced and the animations & graphics were so odd, I was just intrigued. It was fun to play through once as a suprise on top of the multiplayer, which is all I bought it for."
5,Great Game!,"This game was very fun to play. My only gripe with it is that it was very short, but the multiplayer more than makes up for this. It's easy to play, and the game walks you through everything so you don't get frustrated. This would be great for young kids especially, because of the comfortable learning curve and the fun pokemon-style Chari-creatures. It makes for a good family game also."
4,bomberman is the bomb!,"THIS IS A GREAT GAME BUT THE GRAPHICS ARE POOR. THE BEST PART IS WHEN YOU PLAY THE BATTLE GAME.THE NORMAL GAME YOULL PROBABLY NEED A GUIDE BOOK FOR IT , IF THERE IS. I REQUEST THIS FOR SOME PEOPLE."
3,A LITTLE LESS THAN A GOOD GAME.,"First this game has 2 MAJOR FLAWS.First FLAW the game is extremely long game every level last's about 20 minutes5 worlds 16 areas each world=extremely long game!2ndFLAW it is extremely repetitive plant a bomb,wait for it to blow an enemy up,and move on that's about it.There are also 5 different mini-games 1 per world but they aren't enough for anyone to buy the game the only 2 good features about the game are the charaboms like a pokamon you power them up and battle them.also the multiplayer it reminds me of the classic bomberman for genesis but witha mix of 3D,cartoon,and cell shading.BUT extremely long+extremely repetitive=EXTREMELY BORING!"
3,A LITTLE LESS THAN A GOOD GAME.,"It's allmost in the rank of a ''good game'' but has 2 MAJOR FLAWS.First it is an extremely long game,almost every levellasts longer than 10 minutes,and there are 5 world's with 16areas [levels] each.2nd flaw it is also extremely repetitiveplant a bomb,wait for it to blow an enemy up,and move onthere are also mini-games but they aren't enough to make anyone buy the game and the come once in a while [one every world] 5 worlds 5 mini-games.The only 2 good things about the game are collecting some pokemon like creature's and battling them and powering them up but this also hasit's downside the battles don't last long [less than a minute!] the other good thing is the multiplayer it reminds me of the classic genesis bomberman exept in a mix of 3D,cell shading,and cartoon.BUT extremely long+extremely repetitive=EXTREMELY BORING"
3,Eh,"The levels are very repetitive, the camera you have to constantly adjust because the camera doesn't adjust itself, and the levels are 20 - 30 minutes long. Which isn't neccesarily a problem but if you die you have to start ALL OVER losing all stuff you picked up on that level. The sound is obnoxiously annoying, unless you enjoy Hige Hige Hige Hige noises playing all the time.The game has great graphics, and cel shading takes alot of power from the gamecube and it does it perfectly. The music is pretty good, and the level design is decent. You have to rent this game first because I don't like it and you might not either"
4,at times its really cool,"This is the first bomberman game ive played and its pretty cool. I just dont understand why bomberman sounds like a girl. He looks like a tough guy and talks like a little girl, oh well. Its not a game I would buy. Maybe ill just rent it till i beat it. Rent this game first. If you like it and want to buy it go ahead."
1,The Sterling Silver Anklet with Chime Balls and Hearts,The anklet is pretty enough but I feel cheated. I wear long skirts. For that price I expected the chime balls to actually chime. The tinkets and chain are so light that the anklet broke the first time it caught on my skirt. I think I wasted my money.
1,OK,"I have an original Motorola battery that came with my phone and purchased this one as a backup. It does not seem to hold a charge very strongly. Occassionally, it seems to drop all charge or shuts off my phone for no reason."
1,WASTE OF MONEY: these are OLD batteries,sure they have never been used but OLD batteries are not the ones you are looking fo
5,Cell Phone Lithium Battery,"I wrote a review about my experience with the battery and I gave it one star. A couple of days later, I received a call from the owner/manager of the company. He asked me to remove the review because it hurts his sale. By agreeing to remove my review, I was rewarded with 2 same brand of batteries. I used one of the two and I have not experienced the same problem like the first one he sent me. I guess the first one he sent was a lemon. I have not used the 3rd one yet so I hope it is not a lemon like the first. So this is the reason why I give the company a rating of five stars.Dear Owner/operator, I think it is justify for me to tell the truth. Please don't call me to remove this comment."
3,motorola cell phone battery,"This battery is a little different from the old one I had. The old one would die after almost every 5 minutes of conversation. (Like I said, it was OLD.) The new one lasts longer, but I forgot to charge it a couple of times and it died with no warning and turned the phone off in the middle of a call. It didn't give that annoying beep for an hour or so before it died... it just died with no warning. So appreciate the annoying beeps!"
3,Not what I thought it was - Knock off,"I thought that this was a name brand battery. It does work in a E815 Cell phone, I'm just leary of knock off replacements. So if you are looking for a name brand replacement battery this is not for you. If you are open to generic batteries it should be OK. So far it has been working just fine."
1,poor choice,"hey, the phone is great the service is great the battery leaves much to be desired. seriously if i could change this phone i would the battery is the only bad part about it. seriously this battery last 2 fone calls. sorry mates get a new telly"
5,Driver side rear 2000 Grand Prix GTP,"Regulator arrived in just days of placing order packed nicely in the box, upon inspecting and comparing to the broken stock one in the door panel seemed to be better made materials regarding both cables and motor assembly. Pulled old one out minus a few annoying bolts and placed this one in the same way it lined up exactly only issue is the window moves a bit slow on the way up but it doesnt really matter its a sedan and noone sits in the back anyway. Overall a well made product at a good price, thanks again Amazon the savings of some items makes it possible to keep purchasing more."
3,Illustrations don't match those of Friso Henstra of 1973,"Jay Williams' story is wonderful fairy tale, unforgettable, humorous, charming, and, in the original first edition, so exquisitely matched by the illustrations of the immensely talented artist Friso Henstra. The illustrations in this ""new"" edition are a disappointment. Friso Henstra's illustrations in the 1973 edition are alive, witty, distinctive! Nothing can match them for Petronella and anything less risks detracting from the story. It is, after all, a fairy tale, and the new illustrations just don't capture that. The new illustrations are barely a 1-star quality for a story that's 5-star all the way."
4,Henstra's illustrations are very cool,"I did not remember reading this book as a child, although I read every single Danny Dunn (also Jay Williams) many times, and I loved The Practical Princess. Mostly I loved Princess for the awesome illustrations of the Dragon, and when I ordered a used copy for my daughter, Henstra's illustrations did not disappoint.I ordered this old issue of Petronella to get the Henstra illustrations. They are amazing. I am reminded of Yellow Submarine. There are many interesting things to find on each page. Better: the story is a full on fairy tale with all the correct elements, and it unfolds beautifully and magically. Also, the moral of the story on one I had not seen before in childrens books - if you are a woman looking for a man, don't settle for second rate!"
3,Not my favorite,"Petronella was a class assinmend ,so probly thats why i didnt like it. I read better when I read alone. Petronella wants to to save a prince but gets an enchanter."
4,Underrated,Mark of Kri is lots of fun with some good replay value. Only five levels which don't take that long to play through but with challenges to make it interesting and unlockable arenas and outfits. Not a very popular game so I bought mine for next to nothing. Definitely worth it.
1,The truth,"Too sum it all up the real title of this game should be The Kri of Mark because my friend mark started to cry due to the ambiguously happy characters in the game. The game is set in a small suburban chinese dojo. The main character ""Max"" has a dillema. He is forced to save his special friend ""Gary"" from feeling the wrath of his angry step-father. Must i say anymore. One of my friends did enjoy it ""Lance"". He is becoming really good at it too. The other day i noticed that he can now play the game one handed."
2,What's with all the blackness in the game!,"I can't see two feet in front of my character,it's too dark I keep running in to walls and cliffs and my brightness on the tv is turned all the way up. I don't know if there using that to make it scarier or what. The bird in this game seems to be a waste of time to mess with, takes to long to get to the tree limbs you want it to fly to. Just another average game, I wish these company's that make these games would come up with some original ideas. Hack n slash = Boring."
2,i dislike this game,"ok, i played rise of the kasai(sequal) before i played this game so thats why im tired with it. Theres only so much fun u can have with this game. In rise of kasai at first i was like this game is great, this is cool. The characters are cool but I got bored. Why did I get bored? Its a simple clunky hack n' slash game with an ability to stealth around but why? This is supposed to be one of the best underrated games?? pleeeaaaase"
2,What were they thinking?,"Cartoony look, terrible control, shocking violence, repetitive gameplay. The cutscenes are hand drawn still pictures. The main character -Rau- is difficult to move about and he gets stuck on everything. Collision detection is terrible. And as for the ""innovative"" fight controls, it amounts to little more than button mashing. Halfway through the second ""mission"" -walk along and kill everyone you come across- your sword begins to get stuck in something every time you swing it. Frustrating, dull, and stupid. I quit."
5,Outstanding.,"A brilliant insight into the life and times of a man dedicated to the Idea of Revolution first, and socialism, etc, second"
1,Horrible replacement for a good one we had for years!,"We have had a fine jewelry store for almost 14 years. The photo of the Watch Case Movement Holder is not correct, as that is not what we received. The Watch Case Movement Holder is just awful...it looks like a child made it, does NOT secure the watches while you are working on them, and does not even clamp well to the bench where our old one was.Poorly manufactured, horribly finished, and not a good purchase on our part. None of us like it, and would not order another one. We KNOW what a good Watch Case Movement Holder is like, as we had one for about 12 years. It was wonderful - this one, although inexpensive enough, is not."
4,Good performance medium recording!,"In 1999 I heard Kissin ""live"" in Lisbon. He plays the 15 Chopin's preludes and I never had seen an artist be receive so many applause's than Kissin. He comes 9 or 10 times at the stage and he plays 6 encores. It has a madness and a perfect performance. Kissin is ""mad"". He is probably the best performer of the present. He had a perfect technique and a very good feeling. So when this CD was edited I bought IM immediately. It was not a deception, but it wasn't transcendent, mostly because I think the piano had a sound to metallic and the recording is to aggressive and rather selective to ear. Nevertheless is a very good performance and obligatory to buy it."
2,Disappointing,"We had seen Peter Ort play the preludes in person. Unfortunately, he does not have this on a CD so we bought Kissin's CD. It is pleasant but it is not the electric performance I was hoping for."
1,unnatural,"I have to agree with 3-star review that said the other Chopin Prelude recording by Ivan Moravec, while 35 years old, sounds better. Kissin's playing here might be great if there was not so much reverb. We know this recording (or at least we are told) that it was done in a sound studio. It is natural to add reverb but the amount of reverb on this recording makes it unnatural and fake. It doesn't sound like a real Steinway, but a very high priced synthetic piano sound. I wish I didn't get this CD, as it did not meet expectations of I had of Kissin."
2,Kissin must hate Chopin,"based on this recording, as he seems compelled to get through it as quickly as possible. If some of the sheer velocity weren't at least viscerally exciting, it would only get one star. He still needs to grow up some more before he goes from being a prodigy to being a artist."
1,It's Kissin. There are 100 times better accounts.,"Grammophone magazine rated this CD very low, and I agree with them completely. I can't understand why all other reviewers here in Amazon rate all Kissin's CD's to the top. First of all, a hint to everybody: Before you buy Kissin's Chopin CD, listen to it. And ALSO LISTEN to Alfred Cortot's and Artur Rubinstein's accounts of these pieces. If someone after that thinks that Kissin is best, I'll stay quiet. It's just the fact that Cortot is a legacy and his account of the Preludes are still incomparable, though the recording is not the best because of the recording date. Kissin is a child prodigy, whose career has now started to turn down, as I have expected. I'm having a feeling, that people who hate tape hiss and wrong notes and understand nothing of the emotion, feeling and Golden Age of pianists, will buy Kissin's CD. But everyone should listen to Cortot and other ""good old"" pianists, and then make their choice."
5,another excellent disc from Evgeny Kissin,"i love Evgeny Kissin's Chopin. its better than Rubinstein and Horowitz. the sound quality is awesome. the Preludes are brilliantly performed, the Sonata is very dark and agressive, and the Polonaise is fabulous. buy this cd now. you wont regret it."
1,Expansion - collapses,"While I loved the original, the expansion pack has proven to be too slow to be any fun at all. Slow FPS means frustration and death. I am running a high end G5."
3,war games,Good action most of the time but could get monotonous some of the time. Would have been more fun if the ability to choose another weapon was there like for example a sniper rifle would have been better for a lot of the action.
1,Call of Duty United Offensive Mac Version,Was looking forward to this expansion pack with much anticipation. Very disappointed. This version is not ready for general release. Very buggy. Too bad because the original worked great. After contacting ASPYR their response was that they are working on it. Since then I have encountered more bugs. Very frustrating to get to a point in the game and you can't proceed because the game shows error message and you can't go any further on that level. This is during single player mode.
2,No Talent,This band has obviously got problems. These songs are so easy to play and so boring. The singing is horribly off-pitched and the drummer and guitar get off time on several occasions throughout the cd. This band needs to take more time on production and they need to practice more. I don't know why I didn't give it a one!
5,These guys can rock!,"I saw these kids live at the Chain Reaction in October 2000, and let's just say it changed my life. They rock so hard, and Dead to the World shows how great they are. If you had to get only one CD, get this because it's just so incredibley awesome. God's doing great things through them!"
5,The Best Hardcore/Punk Christian band out there!!,These Guys are the punkest out there! They're total christians with a punk appearence...they are awesome i recomend this cd to everyone...even if your not a christian...This CD will change your LIFE!
4,Pretty but badly plated,"The stones on these earrings are really pretty but either it's badly plated or it's not real gold on the post because my skin rashed up which it always does if it's not real gold or sterling silver. I'm not surprised given the very low price so it's not a big deal. So if you are also allergic, these are not for you, but if you aren't, they're quite nice!"
4,A heart-warming novel of courage and love of cancer patients,"Welcome to Camp Hawkins-it's a special place for teen cancer patients in remission. For three short weeks, these bunk mates are allowed to be normal teenagers, battling raging hormones, challenging dares, and competing for prizes, despite their extraordinary knowledge that they may never get to their twenties or be able to watch their parents grow old. This book is about living a lifetime in a few short weeks. It is about preparing to let go of life by magnifying the months, days, hours and seconds that these funny, brave, tender teenages have left. This novel is a cure in it's own way!"
3,Great Multiplayer,"I rate this as an average game. That is only becuase there are actually two very different types of games here.One type of game is one of the worst console games that I have ever played. That is when you play this game in the single player mode. Gameplay is just awefull (and I need to stress that awefullness). It has got to be one of the most boring single player games out there for the xbox.Multiplayer on this game is excellent however. I host xbox parties all the time and this is allways on the ""request"" list. However, dont take the point system to heart. The scoring system for this game is all jacked up. You can get more points from endlessly doing flips and spins over jumps than actually hitting people. If you have lots of friends, buy this game for the novelty of it. If your a smelly underling that sits in their room all day and night by themselves playing xbox games, stay away from this one. It will force you to leave your cage."

1,don't you hate when the owners write their own reviews,the last 3 or 4 people who commented obviously created the game.
1,Stupid! The worst game in the world!,"It is a terrible game! Trust me! 1st you'll find you'll spend more time waiting then playing, 2nd it is really annoying. More annoying then fun."
3,Rent Before Buying,"You may be thinking, ""This is a good price for an Xbox game"". Well think again, because renting this game is an even better price.You'll get tired of the one player Career mode rather quickly. Some levels are a breeze to get through, and some are a pain and are just plain stupid (like hitting all the crates without hitting any of the glowing bowling pins). As soon as you beat the levels, you won't go back to replay them and will only be itching for some multiplayer action. Multiplayer is definetely fun and is the only thing worth owning the game for.Totaled! does take advantage of your Xbox soundtracks so you don't have to listen to their horrible songs.Bottom line: Rent it to beat the levels, or buy it to play with your friends."
4,Totaled!,"A lot of people I have seen don't give this game the chance it deserves. While it IS the traditional demolition derby game, it has quite a few twists and bonuses. What sold it for me, for example, was the ability to use custom soundtracks off of your Xbox's hard drive. Plus extra multiplayer modes like Hunter, where somebody is ""it"" and you have to crash into them to get points. There are many cars and many levels, and the custom soundtrack option only lengthens this game's replayableness. The only thing it seems to be lacking, though not hurting from, is a CREATE-A-CAR mode or PAINT-A-CAR mode. Hopefully a sequel to this game will appear someday with XBOX live capabilities."
4,Very Cool,"Okay... this is a great game, you get to smash up 10 cars, probably the most realistic damage I've ever seen... except Burnout. This game is kinda like Twisted Metal and Stuntman and Burnout in one. You get turbo, you can go off huge jumps, do 360's, flips, and rolls. You also get to collide in midair, and beat the ""tar"" out of the other cars. Jou can jump busses and make cars explode sky high. The levels aren't to big, but there are a lot of 'em. And they are packed with lots of jumps. When I got this game... after returing Wreckless... horrible game... I thought Totaled was gonna be kinda bad, 'cause I'm not into racing games, but I got it anyway, and it was AWESOME. Definetly buy this game. I only gave it 4 stars because the levels could be bigger and a little better, but it is fun. Buy the way, I'm not 12, I just didn't wanna create a password. BUY IT, it's pretty cheap too."
4,Excellent on the whole.,"This story works beautifully once you've finished reading it. Memorable in an unusual way, I find. Often wonderful. As good as ""The Tower"" (by the same authors). Recommended."
4,Pay attention!,"I have seen alot of good anime this one is no exeption. This anime is very dark and mysterious but entertaining. This series may seem random, but, trust me, it will all make sense in the end. It also has a hidden meaning in it as well. My only advise to you is pay careful attention when watching this anime. It is confusing and sometimes it won't make sense to you at all, but if you keep watching the episodes you'll get it."
4,Most avrage americans would not be able to take the out-of-this-worldness of this series.,I love this amime because it's so different form a lot of the stuff we are watching now-and-days. A very well put togeter show that every out-of-the-box person should watch.
3,Weres the recordings?????,"I think this book is great. My big complaint is that Mr. Grossman does not include any of the recordings. When I first bought this book years ago it came with a tape wich, was eaten by a tape player. You have to hear the songs to play them right. I know Mr. Grossmen could of updated this book with a CD but, he did not. Good luck finding all these songs to listen to. I wish Stefan would not of been so cheap. Over all a great book with out the music it is very hard to get a fell for the songs with out hearing them. COME ON STEFAN !"
1,curiosity killed the cat,This collection may possibly have some value from a strictly historical point view. Performing this music however is highly unlikely to be enjoyed by most any audiences no matter how interested they may be in the mississippi delta origins of the blues
2,Hard to keep track of the characters. Tedious and draggy.,I have found this book to have so many characters with conmplicated Roman names that I can't keep track of who is who. It also seems to be very tedious going. Do not recommend. The other SPQR boox were much better.
3,okayish game,"this game was okay, not awesome but pretty good. the concept art was phenomenal even if the finished product didn't quite follow it to the letter. i totally think it was worth playing and every time that i actually played it i got this feeling of immense happiness for having beaten the game. there were a couple of flaws that should probably get patched when the game gets to alpha, such as how nearly every feature in the game doesn't work. honestly i think all the people rating the game either 1 or 5 are a bit mixed up."
1,"""Worst Game Ever Created"" Gamespot Review","The game was the winner of number 1 spot on Gamespot's 10 worst game list. I saw all review videos on multiple sights, the game is so awful YOU CAN DRIVE THROUGH ANYTHING, and bridges you go under, you fall and and keep driving and come out the other side and do things like drive 100 miles an hour on a full horizontal angle of a mountain! The only reason some one should buy this is to laugh non stop at how bad it is."
1,This game is legendary,"saying this game is the worst game ever does not do it justice. There are terribly games and then there's ""Big Rigs Over the Road Racing"" Go to gamespot and read there review."
1,Big Rigs is a Big Flop!,"The developers and publishers of the piece of dung ought to be tried for treason, tared, feathered and sent over to Iraq for target practice!"
1,This game should be againts the law,"This has to be the worse game ever in history.The only reason I gave this one star is because I couldn't put a zero.First of all,when you start the race you can take as much time on the race as you want because you only have one opponet and he never moves at all.When you cross the finish line it says ""You Are Winner"".It look like a bunch of kids made this game.another thing about it is that you can go through anything on the level.You can drive straight into a house and you will go through it.On one point of the game you have to cross a bridge to get across a lake and when you try to drive across the bridge you fall right through it.Another reason that this game is so bad is you can ride into a hill going straight up and you'll ride up it and wont loose speed.The hill can be going perfectly up.This game also has the worst graphics ever.I't looks like a sega saturn game.I would advise you to stay away from this game and not waste your money."
1,Do I even have to bother?,Everyone else has said the same things I wanna say. Just download this game from a torrent site and play for yourself. You may get a slight kick out of it.
1,Worst Game Ever =D,"Please Lord, let no one ever buy this game. Unless you are a collector of bad games. If that's the case this game is top shelf. However, if you are looking for a fun truck driving game, you are in the wrong spot.This game can be summed up into 3 words:You Are Winner"
1,oh my gosh,THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST GAME EVER DEVISED. DO NOT BUY THE BAD BAD GAME. You race against a non moving truck and you drive through a white abyss half the time because you are in a hill. you can drive through ANYTHIING. it is the worst game ever. there is no friction on the trucks wheels so you never even stop unless the brakes are on. this makes Qbert look GOOD. These also have the worst grafic on the gosh darn planet.
1,Buy this game only to have a good laugh.,"Oh my god, this game is the worst game ever to hit shelves. I think it was a joke, to release the most horridly bad game ever. Kinda like Mortal Kombat: Special Forces...... wait that wasn't a joke? Midway was actually serious? Well I quote Alex Navarro from Gamespot.com: DON'T BUY THIS GAME!"
1,THIS GAME OWNS,"This game makes Half-Life 2 look like ""astroids"" It is the best game ever. It gives me a high sex drive and lets me share my feelings with my sister. It is recommended to any one on this world. If you are craving a sexual rush please play this game."
3,Could be better,"The instructions are a little vague; nothing written, only a series of pictures inside the box. The big problem is it doesn't hold together well. The end can easily fall off, dumping all the pieces. A kids product that doesn't stay together is not a good kids product."
2,Disappointing,"The book was originally published in the UK to accompany an outstanding TV documentary by the same title (released in the States as ""World War II, The Lost Color Archives""). It features color picures from the war along with a text composed of excerpts from letters, diaries, etc. The photograhs are ""fair to good"" but take second place to the text. Most of the pictures are small, only a few square inches in size, and many pages have none at all. If you want text you may like it, but if you want the visuals, buy the documentary (VHS and DVD) and skip the book."
2,Some mistakes found,"I found the erroneous picture title on p.85. The title is ""East of Kiev a seemingly never-ending column of German troops extends to the horizon"". It is the column of Russian troops. The uniform is Russian.Some pictures appear to be interesting but they are too small."
5,The right part,This is just the right part if yours is stuck open. It cleared a P0496 Evap High Purge Flow code on an '06 Saturn Vue. The car also had trouble starting after re-fueling and this fixed the problem.
5,Beautifully rendered game for ps3,"This game was my third game for the ps3 but I wish it was my first, the graphics and story line were amazing. I have a one minor complaint about the strain of capturing the Folks id's on my hand. You can only shake, tilt and jerk up on the controller for so long before you need to rest.I highly recommend this game for those who like fantasy flavored RPG's"
3,Fruity,"I bought this because it looked really good. And that it does. The graphics and visuals are amazing, as is the general concept; a doorway into parallel universes with various, interesting new species. That's where the fun ended for me.While my husband enjoyed this game, I found it to be annoyingly redundant. He kind of likes redundant stuff, I loathe it. It seemed like you just had to do the same thing over and over.The plot itself was okay, but could have been better. But overall, this is better left to the kiddies, and I wouldn't recommend it for the avid roleplayer."
3,Like everything but the dual character story,"I will say the most important thing to considered when buying this game.This is an awesome game. First is like a pokemon idea, that you catch monsters ""folks"" and use them to capture other folks or defeat the boss ""folklore"" that is present in each of the seven worlds ""Realms"". That is the great thing about this game because you need to tilt the sixaxis to capture it. So you kind of get sweaty every time you try to capture one.The story is kind of good, yet the way of how it is told, is what makes this a 3.5 star game. To get all the folks and understand the story, you need to play as both characters through the same maps. That's, doing the same thing twice."
4,fun but weird,"i have to say that this is a fun game and if your looking to waste a few hours and still become enthralled in a story, then this might be the game for you. my only complaint is the battle system its a bit weird and almost like a hack and slach with a couple tactics thrown in. being a fan of turn base i havent found a really really good rpg since dragon quest 8 so dont let me deter you."
2,"First level is fun, but not enough to be repeated many times.","The game is very repetitive. The first level you play through absorbing creatures and when you beat it, you go to the second level, which is the same thing. and so on for the rest of the game. Boring to me, but some may enjoy that."
1,Just and advise: play the demo first.,"This game is considered one of the most underrated games. Lot of good reviews, but just follow my advise: play the demo first. Maybe you're gonna love or maybe you're gonna hate it. I hated it. It has really great features, that you could find out simply checking other reviews. I just couldn't stand the way the game tells the story, like reading a book, and too many cut-scenes. I got really bored after a couple of minutes. Simply, not my style. Very subjective point of view, I know, but you had been warned anyway."
2,Lame,I attempted to play this game but found having to read all of the long dialog quite tedious. I think I played it for an hour before I relized there are so many better games I could spend my time playing. I wasnt into the fighting style either. I love fantasy RPGS but I guess this just wasnt my cup of tea.
2,Folkbore?,"Ok, so the music and the artistry of this game are beautiful. The music gets redundant. The gameplay gets redundant. Even the creatures get redundant. I guess the theme of the game is...you guessed it...redundant. It is really pretty though."
1,Pretty garbage,"This has it all: minimal gameplay, little opportunity for exploration, too many cut-scenes and area loads, awkward translations, hard-to-read font, too much information dumped on us too quickly, useless interactivity and way too little atmosphere. (Silent Hill it isn't.) It seems as though these developers really wanted to create a storybook. If so, it should have stayed that way."
1,Some good things but overall boring,"This game has a nice style to it and its different. However, its the only ps3 game that I did not finish even though I was very close to the end. the gameplay rapidly becomes very repetitive and just not interesting. Its really more of a chore. Too bad but it did have potential. I have palyed over 25+ ps3 games. My bottom 2 are MGS4 and folklore. There are many excellent games (demons souls, bioshock, uncharted) but I would not recommend this."
3,The Narator,I got this game because it's a RPG but it just shows still pictures of the person who is talking 3 out of 5 for this one.
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"When the demo for Folklore became available for download a couple of months ago, I was quick to get it. I thought the demo was a LOT of fun, but the only thing I didn't like was all the text bubbles instead of actual voice acting. I knew this game had been created in Japan, so I thought that when the game came to the U.S. the text bubbles would be replaced with voice acting. This game is a lot of fun to play, but be warned that there is a LOT of text to read. Sometimes the text screens go on and on and on. I really think this slows the game down, and really got on my nerves after awhile. You may want to rent this before buying."
1,This game is not working on a PS3 - dont buy this game!,"I honestly dont know how this game can get so many good reviews. My wife and I tried to play this game on the PS3. After the intro when it comes to the monolog for either game characters (doesnt matter whic one you choose) they tell you they have to go to the beach. An arrow blinks to indicate there is probably more text. But you cannot scroll - none of the controles works, except the OK button. When you activate the OK button you have to RESTART THE PS3 to get out of the game. It totally locks up the whole system. This game is crap - I cannot belief that Sony produced and sells such an unfinished game. We also tried online updates but they didnt fix the problem either. This game is just frustrating and no fun at all. DONT BUY!"
1,Aggravating game play and a stupid story...,"The header pretty much covers it. The game is slow paced, requiring you to read most of the dialog, which is poor at best. I only played it for about 20 minutes then I gave up. Too repetitive and boring for me."
2,"if you're Old, you'll like this game","This game isn't for anyone under 30. If you're old, you're gonna love this crap. I turned this game off after a few minutes, that's how boring it got."
5,Awesome *tear,"I wish there were more games like this. It seems theres a lack of fantasy games these days. Instead, most games are totally violent/unimaginative first-person shooters. If you're a fantasy geek (like me!) you'll love this!!! The monsters are really thought out, along with cute descriptions. The plot is totally japanese, including a total twisting yet semi-predictable ending. Also, it must be said this game isn't light and fluffy; it can be a bit scary."
5,Pan's Labyrinth meets Kingdom Hearts meets Pokemon...,"...or at least, that's how I tried to describe it to people. The setting and feel of it are similar to Pan's Labyrinth, where the real world is cold and uninviting and the fairy world, even if it is a fairy world, is oftentimes even more dark, but still magical. Throw in KH and Pokemon for gameplay: KH for the more Action RPG style and Pokemon for the collecting folk and using their abilities. And then finally, throw in just some good, old-fashioned murder mystery and you've got Folklore. I played the demos of this game and was hooked and I wasn't disappointed at all. I just hope other people enjoy it as much as I do."
3,Pretty Good,"Not a bad game. The story line is pretty interesting and the concept of the game makes for a fairly amusing play, but that's pretty much it.The graphics for the game is something that you would expect to see on a PS2, not a PS3 and it really shows.But all in all, it's a good play for the price. If you don't mind the graphics too much, you'll have a bit of fun with it."
3,Could be a great game for the younger players...,"I gave Folkore a few gaming sessions before deciding that I was just too old to get into it. The graphics are great and the story is somewhat intriguing at first...but the gameplay is too repetitive for most people older than 20 to enjoy. I also felt that the dialogue was elementary. On top of that, there are very few cutscenes. For the vast majority of the story, you'll be reading what each character says. I'm not trying to knock the game. I just believe that Folklore was geared for the younger crowd and if thats the case, the creators did their job."
3,"Okay to pass the time, not really something I would fawn over","Was hoping this game would of been better, game-play was one of a kind, but it is quite repetitive after a while. This game was average nothing too bad nor special."
4,A truly unique game,I bought a ps3 on the later side (right before they switched to slim models) and when I told the employee what type of games i typically liked he suggested I buy this if i could find it. Well I bought it on sale somewhere and have been playing it off and on for a long time.It's a great game with a truly interesting art style and amazing soundtrack. The story is cool and seen from two sides.My only complaint is that it's not the kind of game i can sit and play for hours. Probably the only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me.
4,Great - but lend us some voice over talent please!,"Folklore is indisputably a fun game to play. My only complaint is that with the somber and minimalistic music in the background, the title could have really benefited from voicing over all of the speech sequences. I love the artistic presentation and the ""comic-book style"" with which the story is presented - but without either stronger music or more voices I find it difficult to get wrapped into the story. It's no Hemingway after all... I think video games are an excellent medium for telling stories, so it disappointed me to see this game not use all of the multimedia a game can offer to tell its story. It's still one I'd say you would want in your gaming library... just don't plan on beating it in one or two sittings - the endless reams of text with no emotional involvement will quickly put you to sleep."
3,Great graphics but....,This game is beautiful but I find the walking around and fighting things for 2 hours without much purpose is boring and only 10% so far has voiceover work while the other 90% is reading in comic book style. I feel that this is nextgen not ps1 and there is no excuse for this kind of shortcutting on a $60 dollar game don't let the term RPG fool you this is single party hack and slash with magic instead of a sword.
3,It's No Final Fantasy,"I was expecting more of this game. Like one of the other reviewers mentions there is about 90% of the story presented in a kind of comic book style in the cut scenes, which is really disappointing for a PS3 game. Were they too cheap to animate and hire voice actors for all the cut scenes?? I did play the game through to the end (hence the 3 stars), so I got my money's worth from it but I won't ever play it again. If you are a RPG player then I think you will find this game a little weak. It's no where near the standard of a Final Fantasy game (not even close)!"
3,Fun though often repetitive,"I played the demo before buying this game and was impressed by the ambiance created by the graphics and outstanding sound. The full game, however, was somewhat disappointing. The levels are chopped down to bite-size rooms reminiscent of games made during the Pentium 2 generation and loading times are rather long even with the optional HD installation. The camera works well more often than not, but not always. The storyline is confusing, predictable and no too enthralling. I found the highlight to be the combat system and the use of the sixaxis motion sensor (this is the only PS3 game I have where it didn't feel tacked on)."
3,"Not Bad, inventive, original, but lack luster.","Well, This game is pretty fun but doesn't do well in keeping me attached much less holding my attention for too long. But it is a pretty cool game. The gameplay is original and is fairly enjoyable but a bit slow at times. If you're a person who's into RPGs this game will seem like it takes forever to get to the meat of the story. I've been playing for months and i didn't take interest in the story until it came close to the end. Graphically it's also not bad. I'm very impressed by the presentation and the originality of the characters in the game, there has even been an instance which a contest winner had his character design put in the game. If you're like me, you'll probably notice this game had a lot of shift-of-focus in the story even for an RPG. None-the less, over all this game is not that great but also not bad."
4,Great launch game for RPGs lovers,Think this was the first game I played on my PS3. looking back it was actually unique and nothing else out like it. It could use a sequel or DLC to freshin it up. It had and ok story but the main draw to this game is it's cool ability to use the enemy as one with you. great game
3,"It's ok, nothing more, nothing less.","Let me start off by saying that this game has pretty fun gameplay. I've heard it referred to as an rpg, but it's more like hack n slash with different weapons. The story was pretty interesting, and the graphics were pretty, even though all the bright colors were kind of annoying at times, but the way the story is told is downright annoying. The cut scenes are mostly told through still pictures and text, rather than the characters moving around and actually talking. That aside, you are forced to play through the game with both characters if you intend to beat it. I did like seeing the other side of the story, but this made the game unnecessarily repetitive. Finally, this game is ridiculously short, which is probably why you see it selling for 20 dollars. Even playing through the game with both characters, you'll hardly get 10 hours out of it. I enjoyed this game, but I won't be playing it again, and if it had been any longer I don't think I would have finished it."
3,Ehhhhhhh.......,This game is just OK.It has some very unique qualities so will hold your interest for awhile (as long as you REALLY like RPG games).But after awhile it just becomes very repetitive.Not as much fun as I was hoping for and the replay value is nil for me...
2,BORING!,Barely spent an hour with this game and I was ready to sell it!......I played a few games for PS3 before one of them was Conan....which was more fun and violent then this game.....but that's just my opinion please read more reviews....before making your decision.
4,Samurai front crank seal,Suzuki Samurai factory seals must be made from recycled Big Mac boxes. They harden and crack way too early. This oil pump gasket kit is a good alternative to buying an engine gasket set for the front seal.
3,About as good as it could get.,"This album is one of the best funk flex's albums I've seen, better than any of flex's predecessors, it featuring good songs from Nas, D-Block and many others and of course 5-0, flex has mature himself and he does it better here, this is really good album.If you want to check out another funk flex album, go buy funk flex's mixtape vol. 1Thumbs Up from Me."
5,Review of Canon Copier Toner Cartridge,The item was as expected and is now working well (for about 2 weeks so far).
3,I'm confused.,"What?! I thought Michael only wrote FOUR books under the pseudonym ""Savage"": ""The Savage Nation, The Enemy Within, Liberalism is a Mental Disorder,"" and his latest, ""The Political Zoo."" Every source I've checked confirms this. What's with this? Is this actually a separate book? None of his bibliographies pay any mention to this title, even the independent Wikipedia-esque ones. If anyone out there is actually knowledgable about this, please e-mail me at [...]. I'd like to know."
1,Another Clownish Boob Served Up Conservative Style,"Mr. Weiner(Michael's real name how appropriate) I find your predilection towards grandiloquent words to be both infatuistic and bombastic!, you are a inferior writer! give it up for the sake of all Americans. Mr. Michael Weiner is another in a long line of fame hungry, angry, nihilistic boob's lacking in judgment and prudence, spreading their contagion to the minds of the intelectually challenged(aka Mental Pygmies), his abhorrent behavior is matched only by his rancor. If you have to waste your time on something(like reading or listening to the radio) find something positive and worthwhile, instead of this detestable pontificating oaf."
2,Didn't interest my grandson,"This book was a disappointment to me. It just does not hold my grandson's interest. He is a year old, maybe the child needs to be a little older to really appreciate this book. The problem to me is the lack of color, it is rather bland. I guess it has to be this way so that the water can bring out the color in the pictures. However, there are very few items in the book that change color and they all change to blue. My grandson never even noticed the color change, it is just too little and too subdued. A small child needs something more colorful and more noticeable."
4,Just in time,"This book helped my daughter let go of her favorite rag doll long enough for me to wash it. She didn't want me to put in the washing machine, but with the help of this book she learned that she would get it back."
2,What a waste of money!,"Save your dollars! The ""images"" that appear are so pale and hard to see. I built it up that something would appear, and after wiping it with water, my 20 month old just looked at me and tossed the book aside! There is also a scary looking monster in it that I don't recognize from Sesame Street at all."
3,Luis Fonsi disk,"I'm a fan of Luis Fonsi, but when I purchased this I didn't realize it was only his hits up to 2006. I saw the words ""Exitos"" and I thought that of course it would have ""No me voy por vencido"" on it. When I received it, I was disappointed the song wasn't there, and after listening to the whole album, I was even more disappointed. The best songs here are ""Imaginame sin ti"" and ""Mi Sueño"", which I already have. It would have been better for me to have purchased something else."
4,There's nothing better,"I have to admit, it seemed kind of pointless for me to pick up Luis Fonsi's greatest hits collection considering I already own all *SEVEN* of his albums including the Remix collection, but with this singer, I couldn't resist.There's something about Luis Fonsi's music that sets him apart from other artists. His vocals are so pure, and listening to this compilation of his very best tracks is both a delight for fans and an immensely enjoyable experience for new listeners.Highly recommended. Here's to another seven albums, Fonsi."
2,Shame on you Sr. Fonsi!,"I am a huge Luis Fonsi fan. However he let me down with this greatest hits collection. What is the point of doing such an album if several hits are not included????? Where is ""Estoy Perdido"", ""Me Ire"" or ""La Fuerza De Mi Corazon"". Also, I think it was poor marketing to sell the DVD separately. As for the two new songs, they are quite dull and uninspiring. The only good thing about this collection is the cover art and liner notes."
3,nice wallet. too short tho,this is a very nice wallet. I bought it for my boyfriend who is very particular about the way his money lays in his wallet. this wallet is tooo short for the bills to lay flat. Instead of sending it back I will keep it and give it to my son for his 16th birthday coming up in september. I'm sure Zach wont mind folding the bills to put them in here.Nice quality.. but too short for the bills to lay flat
1,"horrible book about a vile creep, also too long,","This is the worst book, about an extremely repulsive charachter, that I have ever read. Jason Massey is an obsessive, habitual, sadistic sex offender and a complete scumbag. Additionally, I found ""Born Bad"" to be way too long, repetitive and boring. I wish I had never wasted my money on such a crappy book."
4,Crazy,I went to Jr. High with the kids that were murdered. It's scary to realize that stuff was going on in my little town. This book does a good job telling the story how it was...horrible. It makes you think about your own town
5,He's never lost singing from his soul no matter what!,"This guy puts on the best, most fun, and entertaing shows I've seen in decades! I'm glad we can watch, listen and enjoy it at home too! For my money his stage presence, and voice has gotten nothing but better, and better since his days with Three Dog Night. BRAVO!"
1,Disappointment,I was looking forward to hearing Chuck do all the great TDN tunes. Unfortunately this dog has lost his once distinctive voice. I thought the whole production was just a cut above a lounge act. Having his very young daughter sing with him on a couple of tunes made it seem like a Christmas special. A real waste of money. The only highlight was seeing TDN drummer Floyd Sneed make a guest appearance.
3,The missing voice,"I had read reviews of this DVD compared to the 3 Dog Night live one, and I have to say that the other one has much better music. That one has a better band and an orchestra backing it up. This one has the voice of One and Easy to Be Hard, but with a garage band. I wish you could merge the two together."
4,Chuck still has most of it,"I bought this at the same time I got the 3 Dog Night dvd. Chuck Negron doesn't have the range he did 30+ years ago but he hasn't lost it by a long shot. His band does a good job of getting in the most prominent hooks most people will remember. His show is not as polished a production as 3 Dog Night's; they have the original guitar and keyboard player still with them. Danny and Cory may have even gained vocal range and control from covering Chuck's old parts. Their production is clearly superior, but I can't knock Chuck's performance. Buy it, you'll like it."
5,riches to rags,"Chuck has been from riches to rags and back again, I find the whole story very intresting. I love Three Dog Night and wish he was in the band again but I don't see that happening anytime soon or if ever. This DVD gives you an insite of how the band began. If you are into Three Dog Night, I think you will be interested in this DVD."
5,Why did they cancel this series?,"My husband and myself loved the Canadian series Blood Ties when it was available on TV a couple of years ago. We were both sad when we learned that the series was not going to be renewed and that our favorite characters: Vickie, Henry and Mike Celluci were retired for good. I was tickled to purchase this complete Blood Ties series for my husband for our anniversary. We have both enjoyed it and the purchase was a great one. The DVD's were perfect and delivered in short order. We watched all the episodes with interest and some nostalgia. Friends of ours, who were not familiar with the series, have already put requests in to borrow it once we can let it go for awhile. If you like the supernatural, vampires and detective stories...you will love the Blood Ties Series!!! Check it out!!Kat P."
3,Blood Ties,"The storylines and acting is great, i am just not really into the supernatural and making fun of it .As a Christian this is stuff you wouldn""t handle on your own only with the help of YESHUA!!!!!!"
2,Disappointed in the scripting and acting,"I had read and enjoyed some novels by the author whose books were used as the basis for this tv series, and had enjoyed Buffy the vampire slayer and similar shows in that genre, When I watched this series I was however disappointed in the realisation of the characters and the acting overall.The FX were somewhat pathetic as well which didn't help endear the show to me.And the BIG negative .... absolutely no resolution .... clearly they had thought they were going to be renewed for another season ... because nothing was 'finished'.So ... I would NOT recommend this show to others."
5,A Fatal Thaw,"Any time you find a Kate Shugak mystery, read it! That lady and her wolf almost makes me want to visit Alaska...a lot nicer reading about below zero temps than being in them. Dana Stabenow knows how to capture readers early and keep them spell-bound."
4,"2nd in series, getting better...","I'm reading this series in order and this is the second book. Kate is an interesting character with flaws which surface now and then. The books are almost as much about Alaska itself as about Kate and the mystery. I've always been fascinated with Alaska and I can see and feel the atmosphere with each page. Both books deal more with Kate and her relationships with friends, family and the residents of the remote ""Park"" than it does the case she is working on. In both books about 3/4 of the way through she suddenly solves it in her head without the reader being let in on how she did it. The rest deals with her going directly to the killer, this time alone without backup from others who let her go, and wraps things up. I like the book, but I hope there is a little more crime solving in the next one, or at least I'm privy to the process. The killer was easy to identify early on in this one."
5,LOVE the Kate Shugak series!,"Ms. Stabenow writes in a wonderfully descriptive manner, so much so you can almost feel the Alaskan cold. So glad I found this author and plan on reading everything she's written."
3,A Fatal Thaw,"The author clearly has a grasp of the culture of the Alaska Native Americans and weaves it nicely through out the story as well as the prequel to this story. We learn a bit more about the non-native Americans in this sequel without laboring to figure out what might have been disclosed in the earlier volume. It is an enjoyable read, but not a brain buster as we sometimes see from other authors. I sense that the author can and will in the future evolve the plot line to be a little deeper while at the same time exposing the reader to more of the native american culture. I do look forward to more writings from this talented author."
4,Break Up is Murder,"A insane man kills off his neighbors in A FATAL THAW by Dana Stabenow, but when the body counting is finish one of the dead was not killed by the same man.Lisa Getty was involved in many illegal activities in the part and many a woman had reason to hate her for her active interest in their husbands. Kate is faced with the difficult task of finding to real killer hidden among all the possible suspects.The final scene in this books is one of the most beautiful expressions of the Native American concept of living, death, and the glories of heritage. Not to be missed in the Kate Shugak saga.Nash Black, author whose books are now available in Kindle editions.Writing as a Small BusinessHaints"
2,A mystery book product,"To sell a mystery book, you must pick a unique character, preferrably one that is ""exotic"" to your average bourgeois box-dweller. Then you have to find a similarly exotic setting, and some obvious case that isn't so obvious. Layer on top of that some character drama, and you have a mystery. This one isn't bad but it does not inspire to any great degree."
4,Almost Perfect,"This cd has an excellent variety of well-known Celine Dion ballads, plus one that I think is very hard to find for karaoke: ""Only One Road"". The music is great. The only thing that seemed to be missing were a few lines in the songs. Sometimes the chorus seemed to come a little too quickly, but maybe it's just me. Overall, a great cd."
3,Acceptable toy,"At $5, I bought this to put away for a birthday next year for my three-year old granddaughter. The item itself appears very cute, colorful, and well made, but there are a lot of pretty small pieces. The packaging says that this is for children aged 3 or older. I'm thinking that I need to hold this back until my granddaughter is five because my daughter-in-law will appreciate that more. August 18, 2007. Amazon notified me that this item is on the recall list of unacceptable toys made in China. Fortunately, I never gave this to my granddaughter. If you have one, contact Mattel online about returning yours."
3,"Pretty, but...",Be aware that the picture for these doesn't accurately reflect the color AT ALL. They are gold all the way down in color and don't have any pink/white/grey metals like you see in the picture.
1,very unprofessional DVD,"Elissa Au may be a world champion, but this DVD certainly is unprofessional and frankly lame. Some very basic moves are covered (kicks, blocks and punches), in a tiny room where she and her assistant can barely fit three moves in. In addition, the producers didn't bother re-shoot scenes where she misspeaks and corrects herself (""the next move will be .... oh I'm sorry, I mean the next move we'll cover is ...""). It makes the DVD seem like a draft shoot, a home video you might expect on youtube, not a professional DVD that would cost as much as it did. The DVD may be of interest to total beginners - for advanced or intermediate karateka, it's not of much use. Note on my DVD the final chapter did not play as the DVD was defective."
4,Super mario sunshine as told by the game guru,"Well as you know Mr. Mario has been around since the first donkey kong jr. game in which he first apperred, producing game after game, after game. This may be the best mario game ever introduced into the system. This time you go to a clean, peace loving, shinning island for a vacation, when he lands, however, he is greated by an imposter mario called shadow mario that is messing up the island with slime. Then you get this robot pump named F.L.U.D.D. (created by Dr. Gadd, the same on that makes the vacume in luigi's mansion) that you need in order to beat the game. Mario is thow in jail and is ordered to clean the entire island and then he can leave. The mario game itself is long. Like other games, it starts out easy and gets very hard. your goal in the game is to gather shine sprites and make the island clean. Later in the game you get new parts for F.L.U.D.D. and you can get yousi. In this game he can't swim."
4,A really great game!!,"My sister and I have had this game for a while now and we still love to play it! It has a ton of levels and it never gets boring! It is totally worth the money and we would recommend it! It is sort of a strange plot, but anyway, it really engages us! The only problem we had with it was when we bought it we didn't know it was only for one player, but that doesn't matter because you can make multiple accounts. We would give this game 100 stars if we could. We sometimes let our 4 year old brother play it but he just runs around in circles and looses so do'nt buy it for little kids. Buy this for a kid who is into Mario stuff and they won't be able to stop thanking you!(...)"
4,Follow Up To Mario 64.,I remember reading about this game that was in progress when Mario 64 was released and sure enough this game was it.I think that at times this game can be very fun..ONCE YOU START PROGRESSING. It can be very rough at times. YES! I admit using my handy dandy game guide to get me through but even with a game guide you still get so confused. It gets confusing when certain cut scences that were suppose to happening after a certain amount of stars happens later on in the game or you just so happen to run in section were something takes place. I can not stress enough how the graphics in this game are so prestine and real I love it! I think once I get use to everything will I understand more but I will rate this game 4 stars.
4,Super Mario Sunshine,"I'm definitely a Nintendo era kid. I grew up more with the SNES, and of course Mario dominated the game industry in all sense of the word. I LOVED Super Mario World and Super Mario 64. Then... finally a new Mario game was to be released on the GameCube. I picked this up not too long ago and don't get me wrong, it's imaginative, kid/ adult friendly, graphically beautiful and all the other intuitive things the Mario franchise has built itself on. BUT... it lacks some of the things that made all the other Mario games so wonderful. Remember the blocks from all the other Mario games? They are virtually gone along with many other elements that made Mario games so unique. Rest assured though, Super Mario Sunshine still retains much of its classic Super Mario 64 feel. I really like this game, I just wish it was a little less modernized."
3,Frustration with a capitol F,"You know that feeling you get when you finally accomplish an almost impossible task, have a few moments of gratification, and then realize there was no point because it was never fun? Well, I would call it playing Super Mario Sunshine, but that might be just a little too narrow. I'm not saying that nothing in SMS (akronym) is easy, but there are so many frustrating points, it takes 90% of the fun out of the game. You wanna know what else I hate about the game? Just like in Super Mario 64, the camera makes the game harder than it needs to be, and you have to rescue the princess . . . AGAIN!! Come on, Miyamoto, this is the 21st century!... God, I hate sexual profiling.I could be as guilty as anyone for pressuring Miyamoto into making another Mario adventure game when he wasn't ready, so I hope we've all learned a lesson from this.Okay, you've read my two-cents. Now you can read all the happy-go-lucky reviews that tell you how this game is such a ""masterpiece."""
5,a great game!,"this is a great game! i think everyone should try this! who cares if its another mario 64? i dont. its a very cool game! try it, its great!!!!!!!!! :)"
1,Poor quality software,"Hey,[...] let me say that this game is of extremely poor quality. I have never been more frustrated with a platformer. The controls are awfully jittery and the camera is disgusting.... ahh... and not only is the gameplay bad, but the story isn't all that exciting.... man... what an awful game.... vacationing on an island that's being vandalized by a Mario impersonator? great stuff..... for sure... god... go pick up Paper Mario: the Thousand-Year Door, or wait for the ""real"" sequel to Super Mario 64, if they ever make one"
1,Complicated,"This is hard. I had beaten all of the missions, but the stupid blue coin system is killing me. Rent it. If you wanna improve your chances of getting them, rent or buy Sonic 2nd battle and Sonic DX and do Knuckles and Rouge's stages many times. The 3 gems are hidden in a big area,as large as Serina beach. To beat the first stage, stand on top of the ocean,then spray at the manta(s). Note: avoid getting coins unless you have 3 HP."
1,No Thanks!,The game was complicated and confusing for my 5 and 8 year old. We took gamecube back and got Playstation which they like 100% better. They are playing spongebob and scooby doo.
1,what did they think?,This game is the worst game ever! I mean it's only about this paint brush and a toad city. There's a water gun but it looked at the guy's you know what. So this game stinks!!!! Don't play this game.Edward Park
4,I expected better.,"Although, this nintendo team has been famous for its great games in the past *cough*mario64*cough*, I expected better when I went out to buy Super Mario Sunshine. Don't get me wrong, this is a superb game. The graphics are spectacular as is the gameplay, however, to the avid mario 64 and other great platform games fans - don't get your hopes up."
4,Super Mario Sunshine - Great for the little ones!,"As soon as this game was released here ""Down Under"", our sons aged 8 and 10 just had to buy it they said. Lucky for them they have pocket money! They both combined the money they had, and Nana put in a few dollars extra. It is a great game for hand and eye co-ordination. Even our 3 yo daughter has a go every now and then. Mario has great moves and it's such a colourful game. It could keep the children entertained for hours if I permitted them to sit and play it for that long! I recommend it for ALL ages and our children have already highly recommended it to all of their friends. It's a game that you wouldn't want to miss out on having. A+"
1,Super Mario Sunshine,"OOPs Sorry, Never go to play the game. Defective product. Had to send it back. Still waiting for my money to be returned."
2,Not the best,"This game is ok, but not the best I have played! Its controls are strange, and your powers of spraying water are kinda lame"
3,I keep hoping for more,"As long as Mario has been around you'd think Nintendo could come up with a game that has more substance? While somewhat disappointed, the game does play well. But it could be so much more."
1,A disappointment,"Okay where to begin. First, lets talk about the game bad camara view which gets in the way of gameplay from the very beginning. The game becomes very frustrating when one can not see where their jumping, or who there fighting. Second, the game lacks innovation. The game really doesn't have anything new here. At times the game really seem rush. Its alot like Mario 64 but just doesn't meet the gameplay standards of Mario 64. Finally, the graphics of Mario Sunshine is ok, but could have been alot better for a GameCube format. The game is very bright, and is a terrible pain on the eyes. I personally was getting headaches playing the game. In conclusion, Super Mario Sunshine just doesn't compare to classic games like Mario 3,Super Mario World, and Mario 64. Unlike the classic Mario games, Super Mario Sunshine is not a game I would be running back to play again. Do better next time Nintendo, and give us a Mario game that brings back the old magic of Mario games of past!"
5,Mario Rocks!,Mario is finally back! It's been a while since Mario has been on a 3D system and now he's on vacation! You have to go to Isle Delfino and clean up the mess you were blamed for with the FLUDD. It's a water shooting backpack. Your enemy is a water version of Mario and the graphics and everything are awesome! Princess Peach has a butler who is Toad. Yoshi comes in different colors and he dies in water!
2,Just another jumping challenge game,"Sure, this game has some great graphics and a new gameplay element (the water cannon), but just like the previous Mario games, the entire premise of the game is just a bunch of frustrating jumping challenges. You gotta jump from one platform to the next, and if you fall, you go back to the beginning and try again, and again, and again.This premise may have worked five years ago with Mario 64, when most of the 3D games were 1st person shooters, but these days I'd like to see games that are more that just a bunch of DonkeyKong style running and jumping.Luigi's Mansion, while not part of the Super Mario series, at least gave us a more current gameplay experience. As far as I'm concerned, the Super Mario series is dead."
3,Eh.,"I liked the game at first. It was fun, challenging, etc. All that was gone when I came upon the jump quests. They're not technically called that, I just call them that because they're the parts where you have to jump and jump through a map until you reach the end, to get a star.For God's sake...I found this part extremely frustrating that I just quit. I can't say how many times I've tried, 10, 20 times?Yes, I suck at them. Yes, it's my fault. But let me warn you, it's not my fault that the game isn't very sensitive to my stops. There isn't a time where I can just stop moving without it moving a bit too farther than I expected it. This was the most frustrating thing about this game. It's too bad, I liked it until I got to the jumping parts. Oh well."
4,cool,"I rented this game today and have been playing it for hours! This game is more fun than Mario 64! ( of course that's my opinion.)This game will be the first thing on my b'day list. Hey, let me tell u a little secret, peach doesn't get kidnapped by BOWSER but in the middle of the game she does get kidnapped. I won't tell by who though!"
4,A Refreshing Game,"I would just like to say that it is refreshing to have a game like this. It's been a while since we've had fun just running, jumping,(and now water-blasting) around in a game! I mean, titles like Zelda and Super Smash Bros Melee are great (some of Nintendo's best, actually), but it's about time we had a no-holds-barred-do-it-your-way game like Super Mario 64!"
4,My son was in heaven,"I didn't even know this game existed until my autistic son was begging me to get it for him. His obsession for the last two years has been Mario Bros. This game has kept him engaged and focused when usually he's all over the place. He loves to figure out what's next and would play it for hours if we let him. If you have a special needs child that does well with video games, I would recommend this one."
4,incredible!!,this game is great! The camera is the only let down I have. but the camera doesnt really get in the way to much.other than that this IS the best game on Gamecube!
4,It Started in the 80's,"If you grew up playing Super Mario Brothers in the 80's you will still love the unique game style of this Mario game. I feel that if you haven't played a Mario video game you haven't played a video game. The worlds in this game are so unique that if you see anything like it in the coming years for other systems you will always remember that, that was taken from Super Mario Sunshine.Mario video games are some of the most addictive games because they are challenging, it isn't one of those games you can finish in a day if you played non-stop. You will always find something that you didn't see before, such as the detailed threads that hold Marios pants together, that for one proves that the GCN can do great things. If you can see the threads to hold pants together it's amazingly detailed. This game is awsome, if you don't have a GCN (Nintendo GameCube), you should buy the system just to play this game."
3,Dont believe teh hype,"I personally think people overrated this with scores such as 9/10 or 10/10 and the such in many publications. The graphics are smooth on the eyes, but if you want graphics, go buy an Xbox. The sound is good, featuring many classic Mario fanfares, though some of the music gets annoying. The big fault is the gameplay. It feels like Super Mario 64 ""downgraded"". All of the levels pretty much focus around either avoiding traps or using water to your advantage, and that gets old after a while. The waterpack is hardly a worthy exchange for all the powerups found in past Mario games. One of my major turn offs was the objective design. . . almost every level had you doing the same things(collect red coins, defeating the same boss you fought 3 levels ago), whilst sometimes jamming to elevator music(no kidding ya.)Overall, I'd give SMS a 7.5. Definitely worth playing in a time when shooters and whatsnot are taking over, but not really as Super as the past Marios."
3,Cd didn't play well in system.,"CD didn't play in system very well. Kept getting error, and having to restart, unable to enjoy.Scratches kept system from reading disc, so I had to go purchase another at local store."
4,Fun but annoying,"This is a fun game, even though it's not a ""real"" mario game like Super Mario 64. It can, however, be very challenging due to wonky camera controls. Moves like ""wall jumping"" when doing it between two narrow objects will often leave you jumping into thin air because you cannot perfectly align the camera. I would say kids 10 and up could play this, but younger than that would most likely have a difficult time of it. Graphics are beautiful. Music is fun."
3,...its mario.....soo.....i give it a better score,"ehhhh...i love mario dont get me wrong....but....idk...maybe im not into platforming anymore...and this game just seems so incredibly childish...i didnt play it more than 3 hours...its not the games fault, if u like this type of game..mario is always a reliable platformer..he is the platforming god"
3,Not as good as expected,"I think people gave this game such a high rating because it's Mario ;and people love Mario. Well, I did, but this game is entirely too short. Under 8 worlds. There aren't very many levels like Mario64 and the whole theme of a vacation is dumb. The worlds and levels are entirely too easy. There were only a couple that made me sit and think for more than 2 minutes. This game took me 3 days to beat with everything. That is sad. Don't rate a game good because it has Mario, rate it because it is a good game with good things in it. I was expecting so much and my hopes just fell after playing this game."
4,GREATEST MARIO GAME THERE IS,"I got this game with a memory card ( it is imposible without it) . I love it but, if you save your money for it, save more for the merory card. Because you will never get to at least to the two pety pirhana levels in banico hills (which in my opinion are the hardest). Here is a little hin t for the new people when you start it, go to the other of the air strip first. Oh and one more thing, DO NOT RENT THIS FIRST or at least without a merory card."
3,Completely lacks the imagination that made Mario 64 so great,"Super Mario Sunshine never achieves what made Super Mario 64 so great. IMAGINATION. Super Mario 64 included many things such as winged caps, with Mario souring above everything, with heoric music going on, a haunted house level that was actually CREEPY, and missions that were actually fun to do. The haunted house in this game was simply a joke. This is one example of an element of gameplay that lost all it's inspiration. This game had a lighthearted manner that just messed everything up. The bosses in SM64 were serious encounters, with challenging levels to go along with them. Not this one. In this game, bosses usually including pulling a cork out of a squid's stomach. This game loses it's pace about 1/4 of the way through. NOT NEARLY as good as Super Mario 64. Hopefully, Super Mario 128 (it has been confirmed by Nintendo) will be more like Super Mario 64."
2,If I could go back in time,"Mario Sunshine is a game that requires you to try things over and over, again and again. I personally gave up on it: I kept getting killed on the melting sand blocks. In this game Mario has a water pack and he can hover with it or dissolve his enemies. If I could go back in time, I would stop myself from buying this game, but if you're a Mario fan go ahead and take the risk."
5,One of the best Gamecube games,This is a cool game with a lot of adventures and levels to choose from.highly recomend it to everyone!
5,Love this game!,"I absolutely loved this game when it first came out, I have misplaced mine over the years and wanted to get this for my kids who love Mario. It shipped quickly and came in a bubble wrap package so it wouldn't be damaged. Can't wait to play with my kids."
3,"Cute, but frustrating","The graphics on this game are alot better than on N64, and overall the game is cute. But it has basically the same problems as N64. The camera angles are horrible. I can't tell you how many times I died or got hit or whatever due to the camera not aiming the way I need it to be to see. The controls aren't worth while either. Half the time Mario doesn't do what you're pushing the buttons for him to do. If I had known that I would be screaming at the game every 15 seconds, I wouldn't have played it. I would think that as long as Nintendo has had to create this game, they would've been able to come up with better cameras and such."
4,This game is great,Super Mario sunshine is a good game.The reason I gave it four stars is beacause Shadow Mario is Bowser who you vs. most of the time.
4,Great game...impossible camera,"i just bought the new game from nintendo, mario sunshine. its entertaining, but it has a couple weak points.# 1: The camera view. i cant tell you how many times i've died because i couldn't even see mario.#2 Underwater controls. the underwater controls are the most frustrationg controls i've ever had to use in a nintendo game. if you're trying to fight an underwater boss, you'll just hopelessy drift around while you slowly get killed.If u can live with these two problems, buy this game!"
5,Super Mario Sunshine,"One of Mario's greatest adventures of all. Follows the same idea as Mario 64, but it's even better. More challenging bosses and fierce bad enemies make this game excellent. One that should not be missed what so ever. If you're thinking of buying it than do it. One of the greatests games of all!"
3,"Super Mario Sunshine - Too Difficult, but..","Graphically, this game was a masterpiece. It feels like the continuation of Super Mario 64, but it's got an entirely different premise. I felt the controlling was not where it should have been. You're so busy trying to figure out what to press to get Mario to do different things, you don't see the enemy coming up on you. Probably not the best effort Nintendo could have made."
4,Possibly the best platform game on the system.,First of all Super Mario 64 was a great game that deserved a decent sequel and with Super Mario Sunshine Nintendo succeeded.The gameplay and graphics are similar but the missions and story manage to be quite unique.I disagree that Mario is just a kid's series.Ive been playing the Super Mario games since Super Mario Bros came out on the original Nintendo and havent stopped since.Super Mario Sunshine looks absolutely gorgeous but some missions can be very frustrating.Most are really fun though.This time around Mario visits an island only to find out that its polluted and he is framed by Shadow Mario.So he must clean up the entire mess.The game is consistently fun and the clever missions should keep fans of Super Mario 64 pretty happy.
3,"Um, yeah, is this a science class?","I am a Mario fanatic, yet I was severely let down when my younger brother bought the game and let me borrow it. First, Mario's job is to clean the city, what is the fun in cleaning buildings? I felt like the whole game was intended to give a moral lesson on the subject on pollution, thank you, I have a Department of Interior and a science class for that. Save your money. And oh, yeah, must Peach be stolen in EVERY Mario game?"
2,Masterpiece?,"This game is actually a fighter, it's you vs. thecamera everytime you play. If you beat the camera,you are rewarded with a rather nice game, if you loseto the camera you have to start the level over...and I'll say this, be prepared to lose a lot."
2,:(,"i don't like this game.cleaning up the island is so dumb!pianta village is too hard!yoshi melts too much!>:(also,saving peach gets boring after the millionth time you do it!!!!(she has to get bodyguards...)don't buy!!Starfishie""Star""^_~"
5,Awsome!!!!!!!Best Mario game ever!!!,"The best game ever was made!!!Whooooohoooo!!!!!!!!!!!!My favorite place is Sereno Beach!Oh yeah....just to correct 2 people there are ELECTRIC koopas...and the villan...shadow mario IS NOT Mario's archenemy...Bowser,the king of koopas,is.OK,um.....Eely Mouth has a LOT of cavities.How is he sopposed to brush his teeth?OK,that's all!Now to go beg my sister to let me play it..........AAAAAAAAAnnnnnnndddddddd of couse she'll say no.Girl's are so annoying...GASP!!do any girl's come to this website!!!???O-O-Oh Y-Yeah I B-B-B-Beat the G-Game three times...BYE!(I siad it just cuase it's true...BYE!)"
2,The Dumbing down of Video Games,"Those who have played games for a few years now may have realized one thing - games are getting easier. And its not simply due to maturity and being better at finding patterns in games, games are truly getting easier. I don't think that is a good thing to do to games. Infact, the more frusterated I get over a game, the better I feel the game is. Of course there is a limit - too difficult and noone will complete it, but too easy and games get finished in under a week.This game is fun, don't get me wrong. But those who have played older versons of Mario will realize this is far too easy and short and does not make a good addition to the Super Mario Legacy. if you haven't played this - Play it! But, If you want difficulty or you want to feel more accomplished when you finish a level - go back to perhaps Super Mario64."
3,To easy,"This game could be great if it was not so short. I got this game expecting a huge game filled with level after level. I beat it after two weeks and belive me I stink at most video games. In fact that was the first game I ever beat in my whole life, and I have played a lot of games, easy ones. I would get this game if you want something really simple. It is way to easy for me. I hope you liked my reviwe."
4,A Step Down from Super Mario 64,"Okay, okay, this game isn't the best Mario game around. This doesn't make it a bad game. It's a lot more frustrating then any other Mario game before it and yeah the game gets a little boring at times because of the repetitive levels, but by no means should you miss out on this game. In my honest opinion, it's a classic Game Cube game that deserves to be played by all Nintendo fans. I read some negative reviews on this and while a lot were fair, I saw few saying, ""DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!"" I really believe that it's definitely worth a buy, specially now that the price for it used is so low. It's a lot better than most games available today and is definitely worth a playthrough."
3,boooooooooooorrrrrinnnnnggggg,"THIS GAME IS FUN FOR ABOUT 5 MIN. THAN IT GETS BORING AND CONFUSING. I MEAN, IN ORDER TO DO ONE MOVE, YOU NEED TO DO ALL THESE HARD BUTTON COMBOS, AND IT IS WAY TO HARD TO FIND A SHINE SPRITE. I GOT BORED LOOKING FOR THEM QUICKLY. I SUGGEST YOU RENT THIS GAME IF YOU ARE STILL INTERESTED IN IT."
3,too hard!!,"i'm not a wheenie!! i just want to know why it is so hard!! it isn't anything like the first one (super mario 64). i got the official players book, but it was no help. it is really hard."
4,"Super Mario, how about Mario?","This game was not a thrill to me. The levels and music are colorful and up beat, but the missions are almost impossible! YOu heard me right, IMPOSSIBLE! The secret areas are very aggravating to work with beacause mario moves around to much (he does not stop on a dime) and the camara angle you must constantly change. The good things about the game are it's graphics music and freindliness. What I mean about freindlyness is that everyone is happy all the time in this game, untill the middle when peach is stolen. The last thing i didn't like was fludd. The whole water packback thing never really got to me. Overall if you like challenges get this game.~FinnyLemons14"
3,ok game,this game is kinda of fun somtimes but other times it can be very boring its graphics are great though but still doesnt make it better .it could have been better
4,Ummm.....Is this supposed to be fun? : (,"I just don't understand. The past mario games were fun, this one is just frustrating and has terrible graphics! If you like being annoyed by graphics, this is the game 4 u! the walls are flat and untextured. The music goes for about 10 seconds then repeats its self. The most frustrating part of the game is when the developer tried to get the old mario nes feeling back into the game by adding a block shifting level where you jump around and fall off so many times until you get so frustrated you take it back to the store where you bought it from! That's what happened to me! I would recomend buying Star Fox Adventures. It Kicks Butt!!!!The graphics display so much even if you look at the grass on the ground it moves to the wind. this is something even Halo for Xbox didn't accomplish!"
2,Not Very Interesting,"I rented Super Mario Sunshine instead of buying it, and I'm glad. (It's always a good idea to rent a game first...The graphics are gorgeous, and the sound is good too (I don't usually pay that much attention to sound in games, so I can't really evaluate it).This is probably one of those ""love it or hate it"" games. I found the premise -- Mario is falsely accused of splattering a resort town with paint, and is sentenced to community service cleaning up the mess -- cute but not compelling.The camera drove me crazy. Yes, it's (usually) 360 degrees, but it's also almost always pointed the wrong way. I liked it better when a game's camera would automatically point in a logical direction, even if that meant I couldn't control the camera.Lots of people love this game. If you want a traditional ""kill monsters and pick up trinkets"" platform game in a 3-D environment, you'll love it too..."
2,WHAT???,"When I recieved this game, it had two HUGE scratches on it, and I tried using a disk saver, but that didn't work. So now I have a game that doesn't work. :("
5,Super Mario Sunshine,I love Super Mario Sunshine. It's a great game. I gave this game 5 stars because it keeps me guessing every minute.
5,A Must buy!!,"I love this game! It is so fun.I am not very good with aiming but with the hose it makes it easier to clean grafiti or kill monsters! The game is changelling but simple,,lots of fun! This game isn't something that you will be able to beat in a day! It take s a bit! The graphics are wonderful you can choose from different screen shots and best of all it doesn't get me dizzy by always turning around like some games do! This game is not violent or fowl. IT is the perfect game for anyone! The only down side I can say about this game is it is 1 player!"
5,ADDICTIVE! BEST MARIO GAME TO DATE!,"This game is why Nintendo was created. It is humorous, addictive, strategic, and has great graphics and sound. From a teenager's perspective, this is no kiddie game. You can tell that Nintendo put a lot of hard work in to this game. The gameline is not a point A to point B style like most games. It jumps back and forth featuring some easy parts, hard parts, some easy parts, and some more hard parts, so you are always coming back for more(I still am) and most importantly, never get bored of it! This is a game you also wont say, ""I cant believe I was so into that game a long time ago."" In ten years, you will still be in love with it. I am glad I got it, and I know you will be too."
4,Usually I like Mario Games,Some people may like mario 64 cause i sure did. it was fun it had vast levels to explore and so on. this game on the other hand is totaly different. you have to have this water pack thing on. it really wierd the cause you cant punch kick or do anything good like in the old ones.In this the whole point is cleaning. it has nice graphics huge levels and so on. the gameplay is okay. I really recomend this for people who like platforming action
5,Awesome,"Thats about all I have to say, I just picked up the game, and its awesome. Not nearly as easy as some of the previous Mario games, and the graphics are great. If you like platform games at all, you'll love Super Mario Sunshine.Except the voices are pretty cheezy..."
3,Dissapointing,"When I got my Gamecube naturally the Mario title was one of my first choices. After playing for a while and never really getting into it i let it collect dust. This game somehow lacks the magic of past mario titles, and for the first time I am not compelled to reunite the plumber and the princess."
4,Only GOOD,"As with all Mario games, this one is very fun to play at first. But unlike the previous entries, this one gets old pretty fast. The gameplay gets repetitive as you basically do the same things over and over. When you're not climbing up some hill, you're going through some pointless obstacle course, scavenger hunting, or fighting some simple boss. Camera problems are all over the place, so you'll have to get used to the manual camera adjustment system. The last 3D Mario seems to be superior in every way. The watergun added in Sunshine was intended to add some variety in gameplay, but the repetitive missions make the whole package much less varied than previous Mario games. It's disappointing for a Mario game, but it's still good as a game. Kids will find it fun, if not challenging in certain points due to the lazy camera."
5,Great Game,"When I first bought this game I was sure it was going to be good. Super Mario Sunshine has a great storyline and is very fun to play. The graphics are amazing, and when your playing the game its just adding to the great gameplay."
4,AWESOME!!!!!!!!,"This game totally rox!!!!!!!! It has a really good storyline and graphics, although some of the designs could have been more in depth. I recomend this game for kids 10+."
4,The new nintendo game,"Super Mario Sunshine's the best. It's just like the old Super Mario 64, where all games start at Delfino Plaza, where all the painting worlds are. To unlock different worlds, as in the old one, you have to get shine sprites. It's alot of fun, and I as well as my kids absolutely love it. They're even teaching me. It's alot of fun!!! A must-have!!!"
4,Mario Shines Again,"Alright, so it is a mildly ""kiddish"" installment into the Super Mario Bros line, but before you judge it, give it a shot. Mario Sunshine is very influenced by the current ""cartoon-like"" video game craze that has proven very successful in Japan (I.E. Pokemon). It is extremely consuming once you get the hang of it! It can be simple at times and challenging at others. This game will keep you thinking your way through a semi-rpg envoirnment, in which you are provided a water-blasting backpack to clean up the mysterious sludge which Mario is falsely accused of spreading around the tropical Isle Delfino... oh yeah, you also have to save the Princess (But what else is new?). The only true drawback to this game is the poor control layout; they'll frustrate until you have them down. All in all, Mario Sunshine is far superior to Luigi's Mansion and I consider it to be the first true (as in traditional) Mario adventure game to come to the Gamecube."
2,this is pretty lame for mario,"This isn't a good game. The replay value is low and the concept is weak. There is no basis to help you get through the game. You're given clues once and then left out with your pants down. This is the worst Mario ever, and if they keep going this way the game will only get worse."
5,best mario game yet,This game has a different style for you to play as mario. You get blamed for painting delfino with grafitti so you must clean it up. It is very colorful and the graphics are great. Super Mario Sunshine has secrets to. The theme song is the same but a remix of the older version. Buy it now
5,This is a real fun game!,"So, maybe some parts of the game was hard ? So what. It made the game vary fun. There are so many parts of the game, wich made the game even better! I promise, once you buy this fun vidio game, ( IF you ever do, that is.) You will never EVER stop playing it, becouse you will think this game will be WAY to fun to ever stop playing!"
1,You people are all crazy! Why all the reviews?,"I read about 10 reviews and they all say ""I can't wait to play the game."" Why don't you review the game AFTER YOU'VE PLAYED IT... not before!"
2,Disappointment at its best!,"I am a huge fan when it comes to Mario games but this one let me down. I got it for Christmas and jumped right on to play it. But after spraying about a thousand or so plants you start to wonder why the heck you are still playing. The next day I sold it at Gamestop, now it's someone else's problem."
4,All about Mario's New Adventure,"I have read that this game is about Mario on Vacation with Toad & Peach.Mario has been accused as grafitying the whole island.Now he has to use his new water pack (similar to Luigi's vaccuum in Luigi's Mansion).He must use it to spray away all the grafity on the island.So this game is going to be a blast, especially for Mario fans!"
4,the shiny game!,"this game is no doubt very fun the graphics are good and the characters and bosses are good but the plot is strange, cleaning up an island i dont think so overall though i think this game is worth your money and is good fun"
3,Eh.. =S,"This was the very first game I got for my Gamecube. At first I liked it because it was a big island and I just explored it! I quickly got bored of its bad storyline and mediocre game play. It gathered dust on my shelf for about a year and the other day I stumbled across it. I started a whole new game and got bored of it all over again in a half hour.This game had GREAT potential but falls short. I see why some people like this game but only for real hardcore mario gamers.Since this game is getting old, the price is low so you might want to buy it just to add it to your collection. However, if your experience with this game is like mine, you'll dig out that good ol' n64 and play Super Mario 64 and Paper Mario to remind yourself that most mario games aren't like this one."
5,Mario Sunshine...In my Gamecube...Makes my happy,"Super Mario Sunshine's story is kind of short, but will be a hit. The story is, if you don't know, Mario and Peach were going on vacation to the beach when somebody disguised as Mario graffittitized the walls. Mario has to take off the graffitti of the walls. The game, in my opinion, will PROBABLY be short by the looks of it. I hope the ""mature"" gamers don't think it's too kiddish for them and pass out on it. If they do, let us have the fun! The characters look colorful, and, sorry for bringing this up Mario, but, he looks chubbier in here. So what? Will we pass up a great game because of Mario's look? NO! Anyway, the is back, and packed, with a water shooter to take off the graffiti from the walls...I believe the bad one here is Wario. I doubt Bowser can be the one...Can he?"
5,"Look, Mario's back and he's fighting himself.","The Gamecube version of Mario is proving to be in excellent shape. This is a new start for the Mario franchise being that Bowser or any of the other bad guys we were used to are not in this game. I see it as an opportunity to introduce us game players to something new, like a breath of fresh air. We all know since Mario is appearing on the Gamecube, the graphics will be breath taking and the worlds will be very colorful. Mario is equipped with new weapons (not fireballs but water and a hose), and hes based in the Tropical Island, which means lots of sand and water.One more thing, The big bad boss will be a see through evil Mario who likes to tag on the walls. This game is going to be the welcome home party for Mario."
5,It's Mario,This is Mario. The plumber that everyone has grown up with for over 20 years. Why stop playing his games now?
2,"Games are supposed to be fun, this isn't.","After waiting 5 years for a new Super Mario game, I had high expectations. In fairness I just started playing this one, but from what I've seen, I don't think I'll have the motivation to play much more. The graphics are great, the music is great, the characters are classic, but the plot is awful, and it is very hard to get motivated when instead of being the hero, you are doing community service. I'm sorry, political correctness doesn't belong in the world of video games, to this extent anyway. I don't like cleaning up graffiti, I liked bouncing on Koopas, and collecting stars, and saving princess Peaches. There was a formula for a reason. Maybe I'll change my mind as I play it more, but I doubt it. Disapointing."
4,Fun in the Sun,"This game is a lot of fun. However, out of the three 3-d Mario's, I would put this 3rd. Thats not putting this game down by any means, because the other 2 are generally considered at the top of most all time gaming lists. If you like platforming, and if you like Mario, give this one a shot, its a little more challenging than most Mario games, but is pretty rewarding overall."
3,long and sometimes disapointing,i just beat the game the 10/20/03 and I was so happy but to fully beat the game you need 120 shine sprites or (lil sunny things). Its filled with mini games and sob stpries but if you have patience you wouldnt mind this game. p.s. the only reason I got this game was because it came with the G-Cube.
5,Great,"I've played the game before when I was younger, so now the game was much easier and more fun. I recommend this game to everyone."
4,It was great!!,"The game itself was in good condition, aside from a few minor scratches and wear-and-tear damage on the box, the game was great and it worked beautifully. I had fun playing it, although the very last level to beat the game is a bit disappointing. Very fun game overall"
4,"fun, but challenging","i got Super Mario Sunshine for Christmas. the game is so awsome! it's really hard, though. be sure to listen to FLUDD. i'll go ahead and give you the number 1 tip if you want to beat the game without a truck-load of trouble. GET THE HANDBOOK. it won't beat the game for you, but it REALLY helps. this game is really fun. like all the mario games, you have to battle evil and rescue peach. i would say the good age group for this game would be 7-30 years old. my 9 year-old brother loves it and my 29 year-old uncle played it while he stayed with my family over Christmas."
2,Don't buy this game!,"This game isn't alot of fun.I loved the first 2 levels but when you get to the first episode,it took me weeks to beat.Then,after you finish the first episode you have no idea of what to do!My friend told me to find the shine sprite gate but it's no where to be found!It's unbelievible!You can only go to about to places and when you find a new passage way,don't get to excited.Its probably a place you've already been.Don't waste your money on this game!"
5,Mario's vacation gone wrong!!!!!!!!!,"Mario is back with Peach and an entourage of toads including Toadsworth have come to Isle Delfino to relax and unwind.At least, that's their plan...but when they arrive, they find things have gone horribly wrong.According to the island inhabitants,the person responsible for the mess has a round nose,a thick mustache, and a cap...what?But...that sounds like Mario!?The islanders are saying that Mario's mess has polluted the island and caused their energy source the Shine Sprites, to vanish.Now the falsely accused Mario has promised to clean up the island,but...how?Never fear!Fludd,the latest invention from Gadd Science, Inc.,can help Mario tidy up the island, and to take on bad guys.That's what the game is mostly about.So if you buy this game I know you'll like it."
5,Great Game not the Best!!,"While this game seems kid oriented and the story a bit dumn...(clean up an island..?) the game play is great. Anyone whether young or old will appreciate the graphics the twisting story and the game play. Some may be sceptical about the FLUDD device that Mario carries with him but it simply becomes something natural on Mario and you'll feel lost without it in the special courses where you don't use it since it was snatched. The game designers made this game in such a way that the FLUDD device that seems like it would make the game easier is simply a necessity not making the game easier but enhancing the gameplay.For those who like to play a game with a good story, this one's got one. At parts the story will make you say, ""I knew that was gonna happen...AGAIN!"" When not three minutes later you'll say, ""WHAT!!!""The graphics in this game are simply beautiful with this you'll see what the gamecube is really capable of."
5,My Thoughts,"I think that Super Mario SunShine is going to be great.I have no real information about this game.I have had Mario64 it was great.Mario Shunshine is going to be great,I have reserved the game,if you have a NINTENDO GAMECUBE you must but this.THE END"
4,cooling down a bit,Hi I'm Chris I just played this game and from what I see it's a very great game. this game is a bit like mario 64 but more creative you fly around with a water pack and clean a sludge thats puluting the island and putting a damper in marios vacation. a man that looks a little like mario mite be to blame
1,Babyish game which is suprisingly liked,I don't know why people adore this game.The graphics are pretty good but the game is just about a little man running around spranging little monsters on a holiday island which is inhabited by blobbish humanoids.I would only recommed for 7 and under.Pathetically babyish.
3,not bad not good,Iv'e played this game for awhile now and iv'e just quit. It's so much like donkey kong 64 when you enter a level theres just so much hard stuff you have to do and you have no idea where to begin. It's more like doing chores than playing a game. Still there are some fun things to it like some miny games but there are just so many hard puzzles like you have to walk acroos a beam and if you fall it takes you 2 minutes to get you back were you were. It's just a big pain.
4,Very Fun Game,This is a very fun game it is for any ages because it is a long game and the secret stars you can get over 120 stars and that is to many this will take you about five months or more and little kids mite need a little help. One of my favorites.Adults will love the is good and difficult game Go Mario!P.S It is like the old marios that are very very fun!
2,Worst Mario Game Ever,"OK, I loved Mario 64. But wow, Mario Sunshine is just awful. The level layouts are confusing. The themes mostly stick to the island tropical setting. This was also the hardest Mario game I've ever played. I gave up after maybe 20 stars. This game was completely uninspired. I look forward to Mario Galaxy, which I hope brings back the different themes of Mario games lore."
3,Am i the only one that finds this VERY hard?,"I was thinking of buying this game for my young son for Christmas because i thought it would be great for him. I decided to rent this before buying and i'm sure glad i did. I am 28 years old and i LOVED all the old Marios and never had a hard time finishing the older games but i find this one very hard and confusing. I thought it was supposed to be a kids game but it's even too hard for ME. If your planning on buying this for your child, i would suggest that you rent it first because i don't know if you want to hear your child say ""Help mom/dad it's too hard"" or ""I don't know what to do"" all day long. I would have liked to give it more stars but after playing all night and getting very frustrated, i just can't."
3,Unless you have the time and patience...,"I'm a huge fan of the Mario series. This game is fun... for a while. It's beautiful, but I would have enjoyed more variety of worlds. The main problem with this games is the difficulty. I mean this may not have been a problem, but each time you fail you have to redo so much it seems more a chore than a game. After dying 5 million times and having to find your way back to the trouble spot you'll see what I mean. This game is also very difficult without a guide."
3,Great game! long though,"i think that super mario sunshine is good. The graphics are great, but it is very long. I bought it 2 years ago but I gave up on it because I thought it had a bug. But it's just long."
4,Super Fun,I love this game. Mario runs around trying to clean up the island with his water shooter. The graphics are great. I recommend this for ages 6 and up.
2,not great,"Firstly the camera annoyed meSecondly, whats the deal with du,pling you sumwhere, and expecting you to figure out what to do, sum explainin might be helpful!It wasnt a terrible game, but you get very bored very easily as u end up waiting for aages and the camera is soo annoying.What especially annoyed me was the levels, some of them were really easy, others were really hard, but in no particular order. They didnt gradually get harder, they were either impossible or really simple, no in between.The levels were also far too long, there were too many diffrent worlds to get around, and no way to keep track on how many 'shines' you go on each level, or which one you should go to next.the graphics werent too bad, but other than that, the game was awaful"
4,Different But Good,This a game that has a lot of action to it. I played this game and it took me about a month to finish. You have to collect 120 shine spirits to restore peace back to Delfino Plaza. This game needs a lot of thinking. If you are not the type that likes to think a lot then i don't recommend this game for you. You have to find ways of getting the shine spirits. You are not on the adventure alone you got water pack to help you. It talks and sprays water. You have to chase an evil Mario that terroizes Delfino Plaza. You will need to go to different places. You will need to gather blue coins to. If you don't like a game that has a lot of hard work don't buy it. This game challenges your brain. Also you will have to go up and down and everywhere to find the blue coins.
4,BLAH!,"DONT BUY THIS!!! ITS A COMPLETE M*********** DISGRACE TO MY MAN MARIO!!! Psyche! Its a really fun Mario game with a new addition, a water pack! Very different from the typical mario style, but still great either way. Kind of like Super Mario 64 like everyone says. Not all that much tho. Thats all I wanted to say. Ill write a full review in the next few weeks."
4,A COOL GAME!!,i just barely bought this game yesterday and its FUN its easy to use...its a great game...mario he is takeing a vaction little does he know that its a ADVENTURE vaction so he gets there and he gos into court and has to clean up all the writeings and stuff on the walls and stuff...this is a great game and its funhave fun with it (today is Aug29)
5,Great Game!,"I think that this game deserves a 4 1/2 star rating. Having the talking water bottle on your back can be annoying at times, but its functions other than its remarks are excellent. I love riding yoshi. In fact, yoshi is one of the reasons I got this game. One thing I miss from super mario 64 is the ability to duck, but backflipping is still there. Once you get Pinna park, than the game becomes extremley cool. Being able to ride the roller coaster and shoot Mecha-Bowser is aswome. Also, the cutscreenes are cool, especially the one where Shadow Mario Splits the water and comes out with Mecha-Bowser (as you have probably noticed, i like that Level). The storyline is kind of cheesy, having an evil clone (the evil cone thing is getting a little boring aka metroid fusion), but the gameplay is awesome."
3,Not what it's cracked up to be.,"Shure they say this game is fun and it is until you get far.When you get to sertin levils it gets borring and hard.Plus there are alot of eazy but borring levils.If you like yoshi dont get exited when you get him because...1 He never goes to outher levels with you 2 he dies in water,and 3 he also dies after time.Also you have levels that you cant hover and there is barly any ground.Also theres no Bowser ,sunflower seeds,or grow mushrooms.To any one that likes other Mario games this game isn't anything like them.And last but not least it is only for 1 player.I would only reccomend this to someone who is despret."
2,Boo Hiss,"This game is, quite frankly, lame.Controls: 5/10 In theory, the controls sound great, but in practice, the camera screws you every way possible. I'd like more control for the camera and for the jumping.Sound: 8/10 Not bad, little annoying, but still nice.Game story: 6/10 Mediocre. The whole fighting quasi-pollution thing is interesting but lame. That and half the sprites you have to buy from the islanders....wtf is up with that?Graphics: 9/10 Well done, especially the water!Gameplay: 3/10 The crappy camera screws up most of your attempts to move. Also, I'm not a fan of the ""Secret of the ...."" levels which are large, annoying puzzles. Some might enjoy that kind of gameplay, but keep it out of my mario game."
1,Worst ever,I have used many phones but this is the worst ever. Main thing is its usability and software design.Actually this software was not designed for a phone. This software was for hand held PDAs which is now being used in Windows based phones. It has plenty of buttons on hardware but anything on the screen is just plain BAD.You cannot use this phone with fingers. You have to have stylus to use the phone screen. I cant take the stylus out every time if I have to use it. You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs. I dont recommend it.
2,Very Fragile,"I purchased this item a few months ago for 200$ I was very happy with it, it worked well, and I had no problems at all. I thought it was the perfect iphone alternative... until the USB port broke. I was charging the phone, and at some point it was knocked, causing the USB port to break off with the charger.I called HTC hoping to get it fixed, they told be the entire motherboard would have to be replaced and it would cost 220$Obviously I opted not to have it fixed. And after reading other reviews and shopping on ebay, I was appearently not the only person to have this problem.The phone is excellent until it breaks, and it will break VERY easily. For that reason I cannot reccommend this item. I went with a cheaper phone and PDA instead."
4,Kessler novel,"This is a good read, even poetic at times in its descriptions of the coast of Nova Scotia, its weather, bird migrations, and the aftermath of a plane crash. This was our library's book club selection for January 2010, and received universally good comments. The life styles of some of the characters are noted, treated fairly, and Kessler digs deeper into the real characters and their interactions under stress."
4,painful book about those who are left behind after tragedy,"This book was different from any other book I've read. The literary style was captivating despite the difficult material. The book begins from the perspective of an ornithologist traveling home from a conference. The plane crashes in the north Atlantic. From that point on, the book focuses on the victim's family members who travel to the closest point of land to the crash site and the bed-and-breakfast inn keeper's who observed the plane crash and hosted a number of family members and disaster specialists after the event. One primary character in this portion is the ornithologist's wife, who is also an ornithologist specializing in the study of migration. I 'enjoyed' the book, if you can say such things about a book focused on disaster, and would recommend it to others. Library book read since the kindle price was above my cut-off price."
3,Beautifully written but dragged in the last third,"I read the first chapter of this in a lit journal last year and was blown away. The first few chapters were so amazingly written and heartbreaking I had to put it down more than once. The book seemed to lose traction around the midpoint--characters dealt with their grief in different ways, but mostly through internal monologues and memories that had me impatient for the plot to move forward. Then, in the last third it began moving again, but in summary that left me cold, or characterization that felt cliched."
1,A Depressing Book that Never Moves Forward,"I really wanted to like this book, based on others' reviews. However, it begins with a plane crash, and the rest of the book continues to depress describing in detail how the deceased's loved ones mope about in a bed and breakfast--near the crash site--where it's often storming and so the electricity is often out, and no one talks much to anyone else. Even the characters and their actions are depressing, they're so predictable ... I gave up on page 130."
1,Please spare me....,"What a load of half baked arguments, pretentiousness, and self indulgent tripe. Mr. McWhorter seems to forget there is a real world where correct grammar matters. ""Standard English"" be it white, black or whatever dialect matters. It's not the dialect itself; it's the acceptance by the majority is what matters. Perceived correct usage of language is second only to looks when humans are communicating. Incorrect, unpopular, or perceived lack of knowledge of the speaker is one of the fastest ways to pidgeon hole oneself in a particular edcuational or economic group. I should know; as a Nooo Yawker I got problems gedding some jobs 'cauze I tawk kinda funny. You know what I'm sayin? fuggeddabout it.Mr. McWhorter does his readers a dis-servce with his petty agenda.Finally, about how ""controversial"" his arguments are... American English has never had an Academie Francaise enforcing its rules . Another classic case of self important jacket copy hyperbole."
3,"Despite it is a Shingo Book, it is a little confuse and repetitive in some subjects","If you have LEAN knwoledge you can follow this reading, but i don't recommended this book for beginners in LEAN subjects"
5,Value for money,"I knew what kind of book I needed as additional litterature in my Msc study.The writer Dr Shiego Shingo looks at the production flow from an engineering viewpoint wearing a scientists glasses and transform the knowledge to the book so it is easy to understand for every technician or economist interested in how to improve and do the lean production thing. A book that can give you a new understanding about how to practically remove or reduce lead time. Key words as waste of making defective products, transport waste, overproduction waste and inventory waste are essential as well as effective set up methods (SMED)."
1,Failure,"I happen to love the book 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and this one the only video game I could find about it. I got it from Amazon, put it into my XP computer. It installed fine, but I couldn't get beyond the main menu. It just froze, and restarting my computer and reinstalling the game did not help. However, Amazon did refound my order."
2,on the whole series...,"I liked how the stories moved... if you like a book that will keep you up until odd hours reading, then I recommend the series. However, if you are capable of picking out plot inconsistancies (of which there are a lot), or get frustrated by poor editing (there are horrible grammar mistakes, spelling mistakes, and sad excuses for sentences all through ALL of her books), or take offense to how a woman writer portrays her female characters as hormone-overdriven tramps who want to sleep with almost anything (Melli, Catherine, etc.), then this is not the series for you."
3,"Not the best, but OK","The 3 stars are for the series as a whole. As a long-time reader of fantasy, I've read most of the top names in the indusry: Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks, Etc. I've also read some real bombs. And although J.V. Jones' ""Book of Words"" trilogy isn't the best fantasy I've ever read, it's not as bad as some people have made it out to be. It does have some intriguing characters (notably Maybor, Baralis, and Tavalisk) and a a fairly interesting plot. What I didn't really care for is how the main characters were constantly put on the defensive(especially Melli). The fact that they were constantly chased/captured/separated began to wear thin by the third book. Also, I would have liked to have seen the magic abilities Jack and Baralis used fleshed out a little more. Overall, not a bad effort for a first-time writer, but could have been better."
1,Big plot continuity errors!,"While I liked the first two books by Jones, I was very disappointed by the third book. While there is clearly an unconsummated marriage in the end of Book 2 and a hinted prophecy that Melli's hymen would only be broken by Jack, this is all ditched in the revisionist opening of the third book. Such glaring plot discontinuities suggest to me that the author either forgot what she had previously written or couldn't figure out how to work towards her prophecy and ditched all in order to conveniently wrap the series up. I am also disappointed by the corresponding shift in focus to Tawl at the expense of Jack. Jack seems to have dropped out of most of the plot development all of a sudden when he and Melli were the focus of the first two books. Now he's on his own when most of the action seems to revolve around Tawl and Melli. Hey! Editor! What were you thinking!?"
3,"Gaunts Ghosts, Straight Sliver","Now this book really sucked compared to any other of the Gaunts Ghosts novels. Personally, the every persistant death threats from Cuu haven't driven my favorite character insane-er and done some serious damage to Mr. Abnetts greatest characters (If you read Guns of Tanith you'll understand, If not hop to it.)Anywho, it was bad, but read it so you can advance the story-plot, and get ready for a much needed relief of Sabbat Mytr.Larks.Signing off. (By the way its kinda cool that some of my friends call me Larks. I'm not just writting it down because I think it sounds cool"
3,It's all about Do It To The Crowd,"I bought this cassette after seeing the video for Do It To The Crowd on Yo! MTV Raps (MTV should be ashamed that they don't play videos anymore). That song was incredible then and it's incredible now. However, I must not be into the house sound that much because I never could find much to like about the rest of the album."
5,One of the best,"Anachronism is a timeless tale of the highs and lows of living told in a way that will leave you with goosebumps. Truly an original book of poetry, Anachronism is far ahead of it's time. I noticed that this book was published before September 11th and Anachronism plays out almost like a prediction of sorts. The bottom line is that this book is a fantastic peice of work that should not be overlooked."
5,Top notch plugs!! Perfect for my 2003 S10 4.3 Vortec.,"High quality, powerfull, super durable plugs to go the distance! I do about 55K miles per year and only replaced my plugs when I reached 145K and it was still running smooth, I could have gone much longer. These plugs were the original type my truck came with. Whenever possible I always stick with OEM parts...Highly recommend these for any GM 4.3L engine. PS They are much cheaper here than at my local parts store."
3,"Great performance, but poor remastering","These recordings are outstandingly graet performaces. In particular, the fifth symphony is derived from the 1942 version, which has never been published previously. Nevertheless, the remastering technique by Teldec is very poor, and they simply cut treble to reduce the surface noise, which also reduces the music largely. Therefore, the listener would enjoy the great performance through the poor sound."
1,Item not as seen in picture,Order this item because I wanted what is in the picture but got something totally different and cheaper. Looked up the part on other sites n some show this n others show what I got picture is misleading n needs to be updated to the propped picture
3,is for sohc motors,"I buy thinking fit for dohc 2.0lts, but no!, the picture no is exactly how product."
5,Great non-US hard rock,I listened to a sample of this band and they really blew me away. I knew I had to find everything I could find by DOGPOUND. The music is very heavy and the singer has a great voice and can sing. I think that a lot of Euro bands are really giving the US bands a run for their money these days. DOGPOUND III is coming out later this year and I guarantee I will buy that one also.
5,Of Ireland and Life,"I read Irish Nocturnes with a great deal of pleasure. Everyone of the 18 essays brought me closer to what one might refer to as the unexpected beauty in our lives. One will definitely fall in love with life. Everyday experiences are told with a touch of wonder to them. As the essays grow deeper in lyricism and poetry, so does the universal appeal of the sentiments they invoke, including longing, nostalgia, gentleness,childlike optimism,adult realism, and stability. The author, Chris Arthur, is a master of sharing personal experiences in a way that they can become one's own. Although I have not been to Ireland, I find myself sharing the author's pathos for Ireland's beauty and strength. I recommend this collection of essays to everyone interested in that which is both beautiful and thoughtful."
1,Con Job,"This cd comes from Argentina. When I received mine yesturday it did not contain the songs listed in the ad and the artists were not the original artists. Each artist's name had a * next to it with the explanation of ""interpretes"". The artists were imitators of the original artists. So I went back and listened to the samples in the ad and they do not appear to be the original artists either. Beware!"
2,Terminate it.,"To be fair, I may have got the wrong end of the stick, or expected too much - but with such a high regard in the realm of Sci-Fi, I would expect anyone to come away thinking that this book should have covered better issues."
4,Great product!,"I wanted some cheap replacement speakers for a junker car to drive to work. These work great, went in no hassle, and souns better than I thought they would."
1,A pale shadow of the original,Re-recorded long after Pet's voice was at its peak and without the benefit of Tony Hatch to make sure everything was first-rate. Save up for a sixties original and give this rather sad album a miss!
1,"Forever Classic, Original Hits - NOT!","This Dutch import is a waste of money!Title: Original HitsSub-title: Forever ClassicABSOLUTELY NOT! Don't let the low price fool you. This is a 1997 recording of all those songs we Baby Boomers remember. Great, lush instrumental backgrounds. Good recording quality.BUT: Petula's voice has changed in 30 years - more sophisticated, yes; more lyrical, yes; BUT - NARROWER RANGE. So, all of the songs have been re-arranged, in a vain attempt to cover her shortcomings. Thus, all of the ""sing-along"" value is lost. The timing is messed up. The notes are different. The ""Las Vegas"" style endings don't mesh with the original feel and style.Here there are all song titles, but they come together about like love beads on a yuppie stock broker!The review software won't let me assign NO STARS, so it has to be ONE!Don't SLEEP IN THIS SUBWAY!The good news is that it only cost me $7!"
1,bad book,Poorly written and is still considered an important academic book to criminal justice classes. Very difficult to read without going to sleep you must skim through it to stay awake.
2,Poorly written list of lists,"I was forced to read this book as part of a promotional process..... The book is very disjointed and should be titled ""Fifteen Essays on Police Supervision."" The entire book reads like a book written entirely to test from in an academic arena. From an instructional stand point the book is fantastic to test from each chapter exposes the reader to concepts and a multitude of lists that the instructor may pull questions from. The problem being that each chapter extols the virtues of the listed concept and why it is the most important factor in supervision. Unfortunately, two chapters later there is a new ""Responsibility"" that is the most important to police supervision, and a new reordered list. The author even makes the error of defining terms with the term used as a definition for itself?In short avoid this book unless it is required reading, or you intend to test from it on a chapter by chapter basis.... Even then there are far better titles to expose students to."
2,required reading,"it was required reading, hard to read text book written in first person. Idea's are poorly organized and idealistic. Only read because I had too, would not suggest to anyone looking for a fun read or to get insight. Only buy it if your told you have too"
2,What was once a pretty strong title has been passed by...,"Whisenand has been a long time name in policing. He has had a lot of good ideas over the years and is cited by other authors constantly. That said, this is a seventh edition and reads like it. The author has fallen into the habit of relying on his tried and trues and using catchy phrases and lists ad nauseum. I found examples of lists within lists within lists. That would be bad enough as a criminal justice student, but as a practitioner who has to memorize those inane lists for promotional exams... (not good.)I respect the individual and his accomplishments - but this 7th edition was definitely one too many. If you are reading this review for ideas on promotional books... please heed my advice and avoid this text!!All the best,Jay"
5,Great scope,"Great scope, very bright with good eye relief.Note that mounting hardware is not included and must be purchased separately."
3,Okay read just for fun,"This book won't tax your brain too much and makes for a quick read. However, it's not something I wouldn't be able to live without. It's most interesting for it's portrayals of Australians and Australian culture."
4,This is so good that I stopped,"at Ft. McHenry on my way from Washington, DC to Maine in a blinding snowstorm (it was closed). I wonder if anyone offers re-creations of Key's aboard the British ship from which he saw the dawns early light? Peter Spiers art is great except for his omnipresent inability to draw faces in more than two or three ways (despite his book ""People"" in which he demonstrates that he can draw the amazing variety of human features).Our son learned the words and melody at ~3 years old from having this read to him One Thousand Times and at 4 he still says, ""play ball"" at the end.It is an interesting snapshot of a small piece of American History and provoked more study: We learned about the more or less forgotten War of 1812 that even for historians seems to evoke a shrug and a ""what was THAT all about?"" And we learned -to our disappointment- that Mr. Key aggressively prosecuted abolitionists during his years as US District Attorney."
3,Okay book,This book breaks up the song phrase by phrase and adds a picture for each phrase. The pictures are small and difficult to use with a large group.
1,Excellent book - useless Kindle edition,"An excellent early archaeological survey of bronze age Ireland rendered unusable by the removal of all the figures, photos and illustrations."
4,"Not bad, not bad...","I thought this was a cute game...graphics are pretty good and controls are very easy to figure out - no instruction manual reading required. You can even get multiple guns...up to 4 of them! Its the little things that I like about this game - like stitch swearing under his breath (in some weird language, but you KNOW he's not saying something nice). Only thing that kinda sucked is that you NEVER really die. Oh sure, you walk off a cliff and die, but then you start right back where you left off. The game is never over, so there is no real satisfaction when you beat a level. You can die 100 times and STILL beat the level - it just takes time. So apart from that little snag, it's a great game for kids or adults."
5,Stitch is gonna ROCK!,"I was lucky enough to play a sneak version of this game at E3. This is by far the best Disney game I have ever played. It's great for kids, and really good for action game fans in general. Stich has all sorts of motion states. He climbs the walls and jetpacks and swings from a grapple hook even! Cool music and really nice looking environmenets and animations make this game look like a winner."
4,Can entertain for HOURS,The game is kind of like a story mode. You can play it over again quite a few times and it wouldn't get old.The only downside: Once you keep playing it over again even the harder levels (Caverns and Chasms) get very easy. It is either that or I am out of the difficulty age range for this game. That age range is probably 5 to 11 year olds.I do not reccommend this game for ages 12 and up.
1,Not Worth the time or $$,"Luckily I was able to return this to Gamestop merely one day after owning it. I gave it a good try but this game lacks any focus/any goals-it has poor camera controls, terrible graphics that would be at home on a PS1 maybe. Another licensed cash-in rushed to come out with a film. Granted, if the gameplay itself was at least FUN, I'd have kept it....in turn I returned it.(and got the hyped Medal of Honor..gonna try that today)In place of Stitch, stick with decent Action/Adventure titles like:Jak and DaxterKlonoa 2Crash Bandicoot(though the load times are slooow)and even Donald Duck Going Quakers is a better title than this.AVOID!rz"
3,Spider man Goes Disney,"If you have children Who like Stitch this is great. But if you have bought the Spiderman game and do not like Stitch you will hate this game. I love Stitch. He is my hero! ""Megga na la kweesta"" Who knows what it means but it sounds cute. How ever this game has a lot of game play like the spiderman game it just feels like you are on wheels eventhough it is 3-D. You even get to swing on a beam that lookd like webbing. But I liked the game anyway"
1,The facts,"More like 1-... Okay, to make it simple, this is a crummy game. It copies other games. I mean doesn't wallcrawling sound farmilar to anyone besides me? And what about the grapple? That sounds an awful lot like Spider-Man: The Movie and Batman: Vengeance. What makes it bad is that Stitch isn't even a superhero. He's just some cuddly alien who finds a home and lives happily ever after. Although girls ages 4 - 7 will somehow find this a good game... I really wanted to like this game since the commercial looks so cool and all. I really did. Honest. But its really not that interesting. The graphics look so messed up. His head is shaped more like a pentagon than it is a circle. Camera angles are just about as messed up as they can be. Sorry guys. But like they say the truth hurts. And I would like to say, This is only my opinion. If anyone thinks differently they have the right to."
4,"Predictably fine, but twice is the charm.","Perhaps because I expected so much from this meeting of giants, the final result proved anticlimactic and unfullfilling. Tony's readings, as sensitive and sincere as they are, cannot match the depth and passion of Evans' settings. Their second meeting, ""Together Again,"" is far more satisfying--a 116-minute reissue which is less a ""compromise"" between the two artists than a deferral on the part of each to the other's strengths."
5,My second favorite Bennett CD,"Bennett is in peak form and Evans is his excellent self. Great jazz singing and playing. Why is this my second favorite? My favorite is Bennett/Evans: Together Again. The songs as a whole invite Bennett to dig deeper, which he does quite well. This CD is more upbeat and some may prefer that but the sequel gives me more to sink my teeth into. I would not be without either."
2,it's not about Moura,"I bought this book to learn about the dangerous life of the Baroness Budberg. Instead, I learned about the dangerous lives of her lovers, Lockhart, Gorky, and Wells, and about the intriguing cast of characters who wandered in and out of their lives. Lockhart, Gorky, and Wells are very interesting but, in Berberova's telling, Moura was not. She's here, she's there, but why? Who was she? By the end, I didn't care."
5,Mind blowing science- beautiful and weird animals,"Whoa. When I first saw this series on PBS I wished that I could rewind it to see some of this crazy stuff again. So now that I have the DVD I can watch that starfish insert its stomach into the mussel or the anemone catch the fish as many times as I want.I have never seen such wild creatures. They are truly alien, yet they live on this planet. A lot of the action takes place underwater and it inspires me to go learn scuba diving! If you are sick and tired of the Big Animals and Crocodile Hunters seen on cable these days, then this series will be a refreshing view of ""the others"" that never get their screen time.The best part of the series is that it weaves in and out between hard-hitting science and just pure eye-candy.Great content and easily navigated menus."
5,Great,"This is one of the best natural science DVDs I have seen. This particular series talks about the evolution of animals. (If you want something on evolution in general, get the PBS evolution series. It is very good).Each episode focuses on one particular phylum of the animal kingdom like sponges, cnidarians etc. The way each episode paves the way for next episode is very good. There is no break in the train of thought/narration from episode to episode.I highly recommend this series for people who are interested in nature and evolution. Very enjoyable and informative."
2,Mystery SMALL items.,"These items are So small like 2-3 inches that you really have to want this mystery item. You get one of the unknown toys and you cannot be sure even buying 13, you will get the one you want."
4,Extends the growing season,"Waiting for spring, I can tell it is going to be great.We have a short growing season and this will really help.We have a neighbor who has been using one for years."
2,Too Big,"Controller is too big for my hands, the button map threw me off. Otherwise the controller works like a charm"
3,"works fine, too fat","This is the ""DUKE"" or L controller contrasted with the S controller. Black and White buttons are above the other buttons, moved below for the S controller, and later replaced with bumpers on the 360 controller. It works fine but the casing is a bit hard, and it is extremely large so much so that it's a bear to use, which is why it was replaced by the much better Japanese S controller."
2,Sticky Fingers,"Shipping and such went without any problems. Upon opening the box, I found the controller to have an unidentifiable sticky substance on the buttons. Also, the trigger buttons suffered from some serious 'act-wildly-unpredictable-and-oftentimes-unresponsive' syndrome. It was admittedly a cheap used controller. The lesson being, you get what you pay for."
5,X box controller,"Controller showed up in perfect shape. First shipment was lost in the mail, so seller was VERY nice and sent me a free came to compensate for the troubles. Good transaction for me, since I am patient and was in no rush."
2,Buy if you have huge hands...,If you can find a more sleek design get it...this is the original controller for the Xbox original...I bought it to replace one that was broke...this one is huuge though and not comfortable to the hand. They have smaller ones and I would recommend them instead this one is just a clunker.
1,Beware of used products....,"I'm a big sports games fan, but I haven't upgraded to the Xbox 360... the thing is that I feel more comfortable with this old bulky controller than the standard version so I decided to go for a ""previously owned"" item due to the impossible mission of getting a new one. Everything went ok (price, delivery, item looks, etc.), until I tried to play with it !, the directional pad simply goes mad and there's no way you can have any control of the game...So please, make sure that any used item you wish to buy not only looks good but also WORKS fine!."
5,High quality product,"Excellent product, extra length is perfect for grilling. These are far superior to the typical bbq tongs sold as part of a bbq set."
5,Wow!,"I normally never write reviews of books. But, this book is amazing...I am taking a course that originally assigned Urman's book on PL/SQL. Urman, I am sure, is well known, as is his book, but it is not as clearly written as this book, and does not teach the concepts as well as this one. You could certainly use this book to teach yourself, or for aid in a course...my simple advice: skip Urman, and get this book!"
3,Rockport Tabea Thong - Olive Green,"Beautiful sandal, but it was way too narrow for me. I sent it to my granddaughter, and it fit her, she wears a 6."
4,A must for a gravy boat,A must for a gravy boat a it prevents gravy from leaking on the table. It looks great with the boat
1,Nondisclosure,"The Amazon listing makes no mention of the fact that this is one volume of a set. What I received was Vol. 3. My 1 star is a comment on the nondisclosure, not on the book."
1,Waste of money,"This is not what you're looking for. Don't make the mistake I did, thinking it would direct you to additional resources. It's a complete waste of money."
3,Disappointed,"I was expecting this book to be my main resource for graduate school scholarship aid but instead I quickly turned around and sold it. This is an introductory guide to scholarships and financial aid. An aid for people who have either been out of the school system for a long time, or college freshmen looking to understand the ins and outs of fin aid. The main problem is that the majority of ugrad students continuing in graduate school are already familiar with the ins and outs so most of this book is pointless for them. There are only brief overview descriptions of the different grad school fin aid options, and these descriptions are covered in other graduate school prep books such as Getting What You Came For. I gave it 3 stars b/c it is a great book for those truly clueless in dealing with fin aid and needing a starting point."
5,WHAT A GREAT GUY THIS PIZZA DUDE IS!,"AS I READ ALL THE WONDERFUL REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOOK I CAN ONLY WONDER WHY EVERYONE IN THE WORLD DOESN'T BUY ONE. YOU SEE THIS BOOK IS ALL ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO BE DEDICATED TO SOMETHING IN LIFE. THIS PIZZA DUDE SHOWS THAT IN THIS MARVELOUS PUBLICATION. YOU CAN TELL THAT HE PUT ALOT INTO MAKING AN INFORMATIVE, WELL WRITTEN AND FUN BOOK FOR ALL US FANS TO ENJOY. THIS IS FAR FROM JUST AN ORDINARY COOKBOOK. THIS PIZZA DUDE IS SUCH A GIFTED WRITER. I'M TELLING YOU FOLKS YOU HAVE TO ORDER THIS BOOK, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY. JUST THE STORIES ALONE WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY YOU DID. NOT TO MENTION ALL THE PHOTO'S OF HIM AND HOW DARN GOOD LOOKING HE IS. THANKS FOR BEING ""THE PIZZAMAN"" BUT MOST OF ALL THANKS FOR BEING MY DADDY. I LOVE YOU DADDY, YOUR #1 ANGEL GABRIELLE ():-)"
1,Stay Away!,"Boo.... on BRS Path flash cards!! If you are expecting the same quality as the BRS Path text, you will be sorely disappointed. These are just your standard flash cards, with a question on one side and answer on the other. No explanation, no detail. For a quality product, try Path Cards, I think it is the same publisher as the quality Pharm Cards."
1,NOTHING like the other BRS cards,"Despite many errors, I really like the BRS card sets. Especially micro and pharm. This pathology set, however, is a waste of time, money, and paper (very cheap, low quality card-stock, but still a waste). Maybe pathology is just to dense of a subject to use flashcards. If the answer is too easy or simple, you really don't need a flashcard. If you want a quick review, just go to the rapid review in the back of FirstAid."
4,Good but w/ printing errors!!,The cards are good but have some printing errors. Card 174 is repeated 3 times w/ the same info on one side and differrent topic on the other side. The pack is missing the last 3 cards. Called the editor and was unable to fix the problem. Good overall!!!Good luck!!
1,Very Disappointing!,"The accompanying pathology review book in the BRS series is excellent, as is generally the case for all of the books in the series, so I had high hopes for the flash cards (which are NOT prepared by the same authors as the pathology book). Unfortunately, the content of the flash cards is very minimal and superficial. As a result, I anticipate that almost no one will find the flash cards to be of much use, which is unfortunate since the concept of pathology flash cards seems to be a good one. Oh well ..."
1,Very poor effort,"These cards are essentially worthless. If you are expecting to learn anything from them, be prepared to be disappointed. They look like someone went through a medical dictionary and put words on one side and the definitions on the other, which I suspect is what happened. Only very marginally useful as a quick review of material you already know. Very low yield, and unfortunate, as they had so much potential."
2,dissapointed,The others reviews listed are right on!The cards do not come close to the BRS review book.The lange flash cards are far superior.
1,worthless,these cards are a complete waste of your money. I suggest getting the Robbins question book for review.
1,Not very good,"I've used this product several times and have since thrown it out. It's nothing better than the other stuff I can get at Target or Walgreens for 1/2 the price. 1st of all, it doesn't go on dry and I had to use my pants to remove some of it before teeing off. 2nd, after about an hour in the sun, my skin started to get all greasy again. 3rd, when I started sweating, it really burned my eyes. I had to pull off at the bathroom to wash my eyes out."
3,"Great history, good mystery, flawed characters","Miriam Grace Monfredo's ""Seneca Falls"" mysteries arevery good reads. The history is always first-rate, andthe mysteries are compelling. The same holds true forThe Stalking Horse, except the not-believable Bronwen Llyras the heroine, and Jacques Sundown as the ""deus ex machina.""In short, Bronwen is not credible as a mid-19th centuryyoung woman. She is a late-20th century ""supergirl"" castanachronistically back into 1860 (especially given theridulous and confining layers of 19th century women's clothing).As for Sundown - too much the stereotypical and stoic ""noble savage"" American Indian with ""eyes like a wolf."" His characterization, and overly convenient intrusions out of nowhereto kill the villain, are ridiculous.None of the above implies that I did not enjoy the mystery, and especially the history. But even good historical novelists like Ms. Monfredo must avoid historical anachronisms and stereotypes to be credible."
5,Brilliant!,"This fifth installment in the Glynis Tryon series is absolutely brilliant! Although we don't see much of Glynis here, we are introduced to her intrepid and fast-thinking niece Bronwen who has become a detective for the famed Pinkerton agency. Bronwen finds herself in a whole mess of trouble as she is trying to track down an agency in the south that is planning the death of President Lincoln. All this is occuring during the week of Lincoln's inaugeration, and Bronwen finds herself against a whole bunch of ruthless and idealogical men who are trying to defend their slavery institution. This book is definitely a page-turner, and it's more espionage than mystery. The setting is in and around the southern states of Virginia and Maryland in early 1860. The setting for this book takes place on and around the train tracks of this very volatile area. And let me tell you, young Bronwen is quite the heroine! Can't wait to read more about her."
2,NOT for assembling model airplanes/cars/etc....,"Possible I got a bad tube, but it was a bad choice for assembling a model! I was looking for a liquid model cement which was fast acting (glue one side stick together, hold for 10s) type. But this is the ""glue both sides, wait for 10 minutes, stick together and hold for 2 minutes"" variety. Impossible to apply to small parts and excess turns to rubber. Get the ""Liquid Plastic Model Cement in Pin Point Applicator"" glue...MUCH MUCH better."
1,More like rubber cement,This stuff was a rubber solid inside the tube. I don't know what has to happen to make a sealed container dry up but this stuff was like rubber cement after it had been left out for a few days. If you want to glue plastic things together find something liquid with an applicator brush.
5,A great book of tab for Black Sabbath fans!,"This book is great. It has lots of the classics all in accurate, high quality tabs and notation. The best part is that most of the songs are from the Ozzy years, only a few from the Dio garbage. This has to be one of the best books available. I've seen reviews for others, but they are no longer in print. If you want to learn Sabbath, get this book. Songs tabbed are: A Hard Road, A National Acrobat,Black Sabbath,Children of the Grave, Children of the Sea Country Girl, Dirty Women, Fairies Wear Boots/Jack the Stripper, Heaven and Hell, Iron Man Junior's Eyes, Looking for Today, N.I.B., Neon Knights, Never Say Die, Paranoid, Planet Caravan, Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, Sleeping Village/Bit of Finger, Snowblind, Supernaut, Sweet Leaf, Tomorrow's Dream, Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes, Voodoo, War Pigs, The Wizard"
4,Great Item,This book is awesome. It was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad I bought it. A wonderful reference about the xmen. Then and now. Great illustrations.
4,Let's Speak Ilokano,"The subject is broken down to an easily followed pattern. The book contains a verb conjugation section that assists the learner to understand the use of verbs. I wish the English/Ilokano dictionary section was larger. Overall, I have found this book very useful."
2,This Port STINKS!!!!,"EWJ 2 is a great game, but when SuperEmpire went to do a GBA port, they were slacking. This game has graphics glitches, a faulty password system, WAY too many bonus areas (small complaint), and worst of all, the game crashes after ""The Villi People"" level. I only gave it two stars becuase the game itself is good. I just hope they do another port, and get Game Titan to do it. I was very disappointed. :("
3,Good game but.....,"This game is really fun to play but it crashes on the fourth(?) level when using a password. And half of the passwords it gives do not work. So if you don't mind playing this game all the way through or if you're lucky enough to get functional passwords, this is a great game."
3,Earthworm Jim II,"Though its a continuation of the Earthworm Jim saga, and it has some cool add ons, just starting out in the game play it seems a little too restrictive. And this is knowing that the first Earthworm Jim for GBA didn't have a save game option. The game came in good condition and played on the first try. Good stuff."
1,the WORST book I've ever read,"I've read quite a few books published by TSR/Wizards. I thought they were all great books until I started reading Greenwood's crap.But I guess I'm just used to reading about heros who aren't invincible and who aren't fantasy clones of their authors. I'm also used to reading tastefully written books rather than glorified smut romance disguised as fantasy (EVERY female character repeatedly ends up naked in every Greenwood story I've every read).Some people are multi-talented. Monte Cook is a good RPG game designer and a respectable author. Ed Greenwood, however, should stick to designing and retire from novel writing."
3,"Good, but lacking something","It was a well-written story with all the expected twists and turns and plots from such an experienced writer. However, it lacked something in the telling that would make it great. It was as if the author didn't really want to reveal anything new about the world, and he was telling the story the way you would read it in a history book. It is useful if you run a campaign in the setting and need historical information on Elminster, but otherwise it isn't really a surprising story or a particularly well-told one. It's missing a certain joi de vivre to make it excellent.On the other hand, it is necessary to read this to understand what is going on in Book 2 of the series, Elminster in Myth Drannor, which has everything that this book lacks. So, if you are interested in the sequel, definately read this. Just get it used and save yourself some money.Harkius"
3,Enjoyable,"This is the first time I encountered the character of Elminster. So far, I'm really enjoying reading it. I find the reading not too heavy. And having not read anything about this magic-user, this is a good start - from the begining. Hope to enjoy reading more. Oh, one thing I find a little too much was Elminster being turned into Elmara. This twist should have been saved and devoted to another story where it could be explored more dramatically"
4,"Quite good but a little ""questy""","For some time I've wanted to get started on the Elminster series. I may be mistaking, but I thought Making of a Mage was out of print for a bit; so had trouble getting my hands on it. Thankfully it's out in Kindle edition now.I enjoyed the first book very much. Now, given the Spellplague and the like, it's kind of neat to see how The Realms started out. One thing that did strike me about this book was that it seemed a bit straightforward; a bit too ""questy"". I also would like to have seen a few more twists and the writing a bit more clever - I kind of saw most of the ""twists"" coming down the road while I read.But I certainly plan on buying the next in the series in a few minutes (probably all of them)."
5,Classic Forgotten Realms,"This is a classic story about the most recognizable, if not the most popular Forgotten Realms character from the creator of the Forgotten Realms world. It can be slow to get into but once you do it is a page turner. It also clearly lays bare many of the details of one of the oldest, most powerful and enigmatic characters in Faerun. The story can be a bit cliche at times but it doesn't detract from the story. This story sums up to me the heyday of the Forgotten Realms world and I recommend it to any fan of high fantasy."
3,Great character poor writer,"Well, I must say that it was fascinating reading about the orgins of the most powerful wizard on Faerun. I must say that I dont like Ed Greenwoods writing style. I cant place it but its a little tedious to read books by him. I cant put my finger on it all I can tell you is that I like any other author's style better than his. I got through it though. Ed Greenwood created Forgotten Realms and thus writes about all the famous characters. Its sad though cause his writing is horrible. Read the book only if you want to get to the origins of the Archmage of Forgotten Realms. Like I said it was a chore to read so I was only reading so I could know about this important character in the Forgotten Realms setting. there is a good 4 or 5 more books. I just finished the 3rd and his style is not any better. but Im bearing with it"
5,Liquidnitro2'a Review: Elminster: The Making of a Mage,"Follow Elminster, the most powerful mage in all of Faerun. See how he began as a simple farmboy, and then turned into a legend. This is a truly exciting and fun book to read and I would recommend this to anyone. Filled with battle, Gods, and Magic, this book will quickly become a favorite for anyone who reads it!"
4,Excellent !! By far we finally have a background story.,I disagree with the badmouthing of Ed Greenwood. Elminster is one of the most important characters in the Forgotten Realms world. And I have to say he is one of my favorite characters in the realms. I'm a die hard FR fan and Ed is a great writer. He is the man responsible for the best world that ever hit the shelf. So back off!!!
4,too bad it's out of print,"If you can find a used copy of the book or video, be sure to do so. The book delves into the lives of a diverse group of gays and lesbians across the country. As an added bonus, it explains how a successful collective produced the movie and book. It also says how mother and lesbian daughter worked together on the book, unheard of in those days."
3,Fabulous tuition if the disks are viewable,"Whatever your style of karate, a set of DVDs from Master Kanazawa is a 'must have' item! However, the world-class instruction is poorly let down by the production quality.The disks are cheaply burned DVD-Rs rather than pressed from a factiory produced glass master. This meant that some portions of my set were unviewable (for me), or jumped and stuttered at best. The sound quality is poor and Kancho's speech is continually 'clipping'.I feel that Rising Sun Productions has let down Master Kanazawa and his tream badly, making it difficult for the dedicated student to get the maximum from the content provided, which is why I knocked two stars off an otherwise 5-star set.I'm also suspicious of the positive reviews from 'Colin of Canada' for all the Rising Sun Productions DVDs. He couldn't possibly work for .. no . couldn't be could it?"
1,A sad and very public end to an otherwise illustrious career,"As one of the premier Shotokan karate exponents of the 20th century Hirokazu Kanazawa deserved the support of a professional production company to make this series. What he got, clearly, was incompetent amateurs, hell bent on the biggest profit for the smallest possible investment-and it shows. What a sad and very public end to an otherwise illustrious!"
4,1st Lady of Hip Hop,"She could have been the queen of Hip Hop if Hurby, her producer, would have helped put out more albums of her. ""I got da feeling"", is a classic. Her lyrics are of the chain---bad to the bone. Everytime I get this album, some how it gets misplaced. Keep this in your collection. True hip hop fans knows what it is all about because it's always tee time."
5,It's Tee Time Again,Sweet Tee deserved so much more credit and love for her skills with the mic. Her rhymes just flowed so smoothly and the music was such classic hip-hop. She never tried to be hard or too soft just right in the middle. This is now one of those rare hard to find cds but just keep trying and we'll all have Tee Time together once again.It's Like That Ya'll
5,her #1 fan of all time,"What's up Hip Hop World? Sweet Tee, now known as Suga ,is one of the fliest and poised M.C.s of all time.Even though she never went plantium, she still reigns as one of the best female M.Cs to check the MIC. along with her smooth flow and writing skills puts her in the ranks with the top Rappers ever to touch a Mic. She needed more material and exposure to be more accepted. But anyhow, hats off to this female rap pioneer."
1,No Settings Are Explained...Returned!,"The heat gun has a variable temperature and this is why I bought it. In the back of it there is a knob with 6 numbers to adjust the temperature but in the manual there is no mention whatsoever on how these work.Am I supposed to guess the temperature that the heat gun reaches when I set it anywhere between one and six? Disappointed. No way to contact this seller either, have to contact Amazon for this now and/or will return it.Update:I contacted the company and they did not know, and neither they called me back.Returned it at once. If you wish to purchase a heat gun with variable temperature settings, there are better ones out there than this one that actually explain the settings and do not leave guess work."
4,Irish Christmas Gift,"I bought this locket as a Christmas gift for my husband. Both his father and my father come from Irish descent so I wanted something to reflect both my love and our heritage. Needless to say, it worked! He thinks that the locket was a wonderful gift. The locket is durable and detailed. My only issue (why it's 4 stars instead of 5) is the latch on the locket. It works, but it could be improved. For the cost of the locket, I was expecting it to be a little better. I'm afraid after some time it will break but no major issues so far! It has a lot of room for photos, one on either/both side(s). It isn't too feminine looking which was important to me since this was for a guy. It's a good size too!"
3,Good CD but track listing is not accurate,I love this CD but the track listing is inaccurate. The song Allelu [Irish Version] is listed but only the English version is on the CD. I like the Irish version better.
4,Review.,Item arrived in good time as described. Will use seller again in the future and recommend to anyone.

5,"Intelligent, well written thriller","The main character is an ex-Marin special forces officer. He is recruited by a Washington big shot (who is literally big: 300 lbs) to find some black market plutonium. Kind of James Bond, but without the fancy gadgets. He follows a long and entertaining path with eventually leads to the compound of Xerxes Antullis, a software billionaire living in the middle of the Nevada desert.The main female character is a very stylish and capable gal.Great story, and I don't want to give things away, but safe to say you never guess what is happening or what people's motives really are. When the twists are revealed, they don't seem forced: they just fit right in with what came before, you you wonder how you didn't get them yourself.Very detailed technical descriptions, but these never get in the way of the fast pace and great interaction between characters. Highly recommended; I would love to see a movie made of this book."
5,LilBowwow is Hot,LilBowwow is so cool that I like his music it is of the heezy fo sheezy.I think this will be tight like the music.
1,Too bad...!!!,"This book should bring something new regarding to the attached tutorial in the Ultradiv software rather than complicating informations that are discussed. Nevertheless, the book is badly discussing the subjects. Very bad organized. the auther didn't even mention the details or the steps of doing such applications. he only showed a few steps of some silly subjects that can be known without this book. This book is more likely kids story book, not an application book.After all, i think that: reading the tutorial and help of the Ultradiv software is much much worthy than going into this bad book. buy yourself some ice cream instead of wasting your money on this book!"
1,Pretty Boring,"Enough of everybody always giving all these cds's 5 stars. This is making cd now reviews look rediculous. This cd is not even average. Jess Klein does have a good voice, but after 5 listens, there is not even one song that is above average> 5 stars means excellent. This is an extremely boring cd."
5,Best album from Jess,Strong lyrics. Simple music. Plain storytelling. Jess is an awesome singer/songwriter. This is an absolute MUST buy!
1,WARNING: Author died 100 years ago.,The author has been dead 100 years. The book is set in the original typeface. This book appears quaint to the general reader.
3,The all important first step,"I bought many Java books. This was the first, and it did give me results. Though I learned ""nothing"" reading it, I could at least SEE my first ever java applets in action. That was very important for rookies like myself .Most other Java books are very thick and full of jargons ... and very discouraging (especially when that ""Hello world!"" applet won't appear until the 5th chapter ! - and you have no idea how to run javac.exe and the DOSC/Command Prompt)This one gives you the initial friendly push as you climb the java learning cliff ."
5,Java for the world wide web was a good book.,"Java for the world wide web thought me the basics of Java programming. But, the book doesn't really tell you where to get a Java compiler. And I wouldn't recomend asking Dori her self."
2,Terrible,"This is a terrible book to learn Java from. If you are going to COPY AND PASTE the code in the book, and modify it a little, for your webpages, then fine. Otherwise, it is confusing and the reader won't really learn a whole lot about the language. Only for people who don't want to program very much."
2,Babysteps for Java,"This book shields you from actually learning the Java language in depth. It's kind of like giving someone a calculator rather than teaching them how to multiply.The additional web addresses to other Java websites was the only helpful thing I found in this book. I am currently reading Sams Java 1.2 and find that to be a more complete book that teaches you the foundation of Java.I previously found no fault in the Visual Quickstart series, but I guess there is a first time for everything.Maybe the 2nd edition will be a more complete package instead of this ""Let me spoon feed Java"" to you guide.mrmalonson@hotmail.com"
1,Avoid this Book,"Reducing Java to a Visual QuickStart guide is a insult to the language and its creators. The Visual quickStart format is ideal for lightweight languages like JavaScript, HTML but for learning Java you need to understand the theoretical concepts. Just looking at examples will be useless. I perused this book at the local bookstore out of curiosity and feel that the book publishers are trying cash in on the success of their books on JavaScript and HTML. No wonder that unlike the other two books, they do not advertise it as a bestseller."
1,A waste of money,"This book is a aimed at the terminally retarded. The simplicity of this book is beyond belief. The worst part is that in an effort to be ultra-simple, the author is just flat wrong. Anyone who can't explain the difference between a class and an object should not be allowed to write a book on java. This book is a total waste of money"
3,Not very helpful for working with JavaScript in Lotus Notes,"There are a lot of examples, but little of the concepts and structure of JavaScript is covered. It would be helpful to know the rules that govern the tool as well as the examples that are given.The on-line access to the examples in the book so that you do not have to re-type everything you want to use is a nice touch.I found it not very helpful when trying to use it as a reference for my Lotus Notes application that uses JavaScript. Definitely geared towards development on the Web as indicated in the title."
1,Beware: Java 1.0,"It is with sadness that I give this book 1 star. But this book only covers Java 1.0.Java 1.2 and the Java Foundation Classes have dramatically altered the Java world and I think that it is a waste of time to learn anything about graphical applications or applets under Java 1.0Other than that glaring problem, the book is lucid and well thought out. It is another fine example of the Visual Quickstart Guides, but it needs to updated to cover the Java Foundation Classes and Swing."
2,Nice Try.,"I have to say that I am a big fan of Dori Smith and the line of very well done books that go with the name, but ""Java, a quick start guide?"" Pretty much like saying ""Heart Surgery, a quick start guide."" This is a good book if you are using a few Java scripts on your website and but don't care about the language or how to program with it. Java goes much deeper than this and even the beginner may get some use out of this book but mostlikely will not learn much. Java is a key word now and this looks like an attempt to cash in on the market. I would also avoid books that say things like ""C++ in twenty four hours!"""
2,Not Quite There...,"I don't feel this book covered the fundamentals of Java very well, and I think if you are new to learning it this book would confuse you more than help. I was very disappointed in this book and I am a fan of the ""visual quick start guides "" I also start with them first and work my way through the books. This one in particular did not live up to them. I guess they can't all be winners. Unless you really already know Java and even then you will not understand the purpose of the book. If you are new to Java don't start with this book."
5,What is says is what you get!,"This book is exactly what it says. It is not a comprehensive Java book however it will show you some quick tricks to make your web site more fun. Like other visual quickstarts it shows you ""How to"" but not ""Why"". After doing the examples you will then be ready to use other more comprehensive books on Java theory and classes. A great book for web beginners and enthusiasts."
5,A must see drama acting at its best,"I have the chance just recently to sit back and watch this dvd and at the end of the 23 Chapters I sat back and applauded the show as I had just watch a marvellous, gritty, brilliant, writen show. If you are a fan of Steve Bocho shows then this is a must, Daniel Benzali,and the entire cast of the show are fabulos, and once you start the dvd you just want to continue till the end. Outstanding drama at its best."
5,one of the best,"This show was just one of the best shows I've watched in a long time. It had everything. Courtroom drama, personal drama. It just was so full of everything I like about mysteries. I think it was better than Damages and Dexter. Great show; wish they would make another season."
5,"A true gem, excellent and worth your time.","I originally saw Murder One when it aired on network television some years ago. I taped the final two episodes on VHS and have greatly enjoyed watching them from time to time. When I learned that the entire season was to be released on DVD, I was overjoyed (seriously).Murder One is excellent television. The other reviews here correctly detail the premise, so all I can do is add another exhortation: Buy this DVD set right now, without delay. Television like this is a rare treat that you do not want to deprive yourself of!"
5,a good one,you ...... will ........... love .......... this ..................item ............ without ......... a ........ doubt ......... I ......... promise ........ you
5,Excellent fundamental motocross /off-road techniques for all,"This book is a great resource for fundamental motocross riding skills. After reading the book I've attempted many of the techniques described and with excellent results. As in any industry skill is attained through practice. The book does a good job of providing what should be practiced while continuously referring to motivational type phrases to assist in the understand of nothing happens without effort and persistence.After reading the book, you can easily watch a motocross race and see the pros apply these very same techniques.I recommend this book for the novice through advanced rider. All skill levels can gain something of value from this book."
5,Proud of My Cousin's Heroic Actions...,"Linda Crozier is my cousin. Her Dad and my Mother were brother and sister. My Mother died a year ago in July, she would have loved to of been able to read this book. Our Grandmother used to talk about this story and told all of us about it when it happened. Our Grandmother didn't live long enough to actually read this book. I know that she is totally proud of Linda as the rest of the family is. After reading this book I respect lightening even more now. I am proud of you, Linda. With Love Your Cousin, Tammy"
1,"This is not a true account of July 27 , 1985 lightning strike.","This account of the events on July 27 1985 is far from a true account. As a key participant in the rescue of the two survivors of the lightning strike I was amazed that my actions and those of my friends were not mentioned in the book. My group warned Adrian Esteban and his friends about the approaching storm , they disregarded our warnings.Rene Miller and 'Brutus' were part of our group camped on the shoulder of Half Dome that night.As they attended to the injured on top , Winston A. and myself ran down to Little Yosemite Valley for help. We were successful and ran back up with Colin Campbell and a member of the trail crew all the while passing back and forth oxygen tanks.I guess over the course of 20 years a story as dramatic as this one can be exagerrated , embellished and change into something entirely different."
1,Shattered Air,"While one reviewer couldn't put the book down, I can no longer pick it up.After many attempts to enjoy the book, the most thrilling thing about it was being able to skip over a great many pages to uncover the story...any story. Alas, I was confronted with geological detail, characters whose pretensions, conceits and vanities left them flat and pedestrian, 4th rate socialogical commentary, and I still haven't found what was promised in the Publisher Description located on Amazon.Simply put, the book should be free thus people will get their money's worth.The Author is a decent writer and I feel bad that this is story he concentrated on."
4,Review,Different story theme than the usual survival tale. Interesting. I learned more about the horrors of random lightening strikes than I ever knew before.
5,Loved it!,"Just got this book yesterday afternoon and finished it today, couldn't put it down. Very well written and held my attention nonstop. Just got back from Yosemite and talked about this event, had to read the book. Lived in El Portal as a kid and we hiked to Paradise all the time, was one of our regular hangouts, I knew and could see exactly where they were talking about. We, as kids, did daring things daily and I thank God there were no tragedies!"
4,Shattered Air,"Excellent account of the events of July 27, 1985. As an avid climber of Half Dome, I have heard the lore of this event for twenty years. Finally, a thoughtfully researched piece on the events and people who converged to experience this tragedy. A good, quick read which is enhanced with solid, technically detailed data on climbing and Yosemite specifically. Very accurate, even down to the detail of the spring off the trail up to Quarter Dome."
4,Great book for those who've made the hike,"The author spends about half of the book introducing you to the people in the story, but once you get them to the top of Half Dome it's a page turner. I've made the hike myself and it was really nice to have had the knowledge of the places and the terrain when reading this book. I recommend it to anyone who has made the hike or is interested in making it."
4,A solid and worthwhile book,"1. For whatever reasons (I'm not totally sure myself), I was somewhat dubious about this book, perhaps I was fairly familiar with Yosemite and Half-dome and I've never heard about this accident etc...2. Bottomline, other than one section of the book where the author went off on some funky tangent describing the cultural changes in the 1960s-70s-80s, the book was a very worthwhile read. The book was well written and the author did an excellent job of neither demonizing the primary climbers involved nor elevate them to some romantic heroic status. The book was a very even handed account of the Half Dome accident and was very informative in regards to the basic science of lightening. Excellent job."
3,OK Read,This was an ok book. A quicker read than I expected. Good retelling of the story of what happened on Half-Dome and background information on the key people. One of the problems of retelling a story such as this is that there are so many moving parts and story lines involved. The author did a good job of keeping it all focused.It can be summarized by stay away from Half-Dome if there are dark clouds or you hear thunder.
5,"Wow. Finally! A good book to match ""Into Thin Air""","If you read my reviews, you'll see I have little tolerance for overly sentimental books that claim to be adventure novels, like that one about the cannibals in the Andes Mountains plane crash (which was just plain gross).This is a great book. I got it from the public library and took a day off of work so I could keep reading it. Wow. Now I'm going to buy it to have it in my library. If you have any knowledge of Yosemite, this will tap into your feelings of vertigo and wonder. This book is well paced, not too detailed, and crackling. It's selling for just $8.95, less than a good bottle of wine.buy it!"
4,Absurdist tragedy,"I picked this gem of a film up because it has 2 of my favorite actors in it (Ioan Gruffudd and Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Although JRM's role is small (but quite pivotal), Ioan really shines as Max, the sergeant of the local police station of Pen-y-Wig, Wales, UK.Emmy Rossum stars also as Jenny/Nicki-Jenny having been murdered in 1988, and fourteen years later, Nicki moving from Alaska to Pen-y-Wig with her mother, Tina Trent. Emmy gives a lovely, nuanced performance (much stronger than her efforts in POSEIDON and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW) and has a fantastic ""Welsh"" accent as Jenny. Her range of emotions as Nicki is palpable on screen.Make sure you have a region free DVD player (it's PAL, region 2) in order to view this absurdist tragedy. A fine foreign film; 4.5 stars."
1,The worst collection of short stories I've ever read,"A few of these stories are redeaming. The one in which a girl pretends to be a lesbian, and the man learning how to fly-fish. The rest of them are downright terrible and should be avoided like the plague. The editor, Edward Faine, has the worst story among the bunch. It reads like it was written by a 16 year old high school student. Don't waste your money."
1,"Cheaply made, don't buy",This lasted for 2 uses and jammed. I could not get it back together after taking it apart. I had to discard it and now have a new all metal tacker that I am very pleased with. No more cheap plastic tackers for me.
4,Amazon faithful,"I really liked the Indian history, from the Indian viewpoint, which I have always been very sympathetic about. I felt the story line was less romantic between the leading characters, so there was some diappointment for me personally. Also I was hoping for the story to follow-up in the final chapter(s)something intersesting about their near or distant futures together."
1,very disappointing,"bleah. i loved The Last Good Man, and so when i saw this book and realized it was about another character from that book, i was excited. what a disappointment. the plot was slow and silly and the characters are not well developed at all. you have no idea what the characters see in ach other. all of a sudden they are in love. what happened???"
4,An Adventurous Love Story,"I enjoyed this book and read it over a rainy weekend. The characters of Heather and Kole are well-drawn and I liked their insights into Indian history and issues. As an author myself, (of a book for mothers, NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL)I appreciate the attention to detail in the panorama of the American West, the story's setting."
2,I've read and enjoyed all of Kathleen's books ...,"But this one was so boring, I couldn't even finish it! Both of the leads, Kole and especially Heather, seem superfically written. I was unable to ""bond"" with either one of them. Lots of allusions to big drama, but halfway through the book, still no interesting drama to be had. :("
2,You Never Can Tell,"As a long time reader of Kathleen Eagle's books, I was disappointed in this one. The plot was minimal, the love story was shallow, and the dialogue was silly a good bit of the time with too many puns and and double-entendres."
4,Another good K Eagle read...,"Native American issues are the basis of the story, but great characerization, writing and insight make it a complete package."
5,Kole and Heather make magic,"I like to buy books by authors I've read before. Sometimes this limits my selection, but I'll have a good idea whether the author's style pleases me. The first book by Kathleen Eagle that I read was THE NIGHT REMEMBERS. I loved it and have made a point of buying all her books. YOU NEVER CAN TELL won't disappoint romance readers who are looking for a love story that has a page-turning plot.Kole and Heather have a lot of road blocks in the way of their love. That's what makes a page turner. I sat up way past midnight reading this one in a single sitting. Kole doesn't seem attractive as a hero at first. He can even seem threatening to Heather, but when she needs him, he's there and the ending is beautiful, perfect. I loved every word!"
1,Bad Nuts,"We have bought Hazelnut scones before and they were really good. The last time we ordered them, the nuts were rancid, so we won't be buying any more packages. Sorry!!"
5,Appreciated by everyone,"Buy this album. It doesn't matter who you are, where you are from, or what kind of music you like. This is the most beautiful acapella singing you will hear. For a serious musician, this will inspire you no matter what you play or what part you sing. If you are a novice, you will be comforted in the beautiful harmonies. If you are interested in anthropology or the study of languages, then you will enjoy this album because all the lyrics are in the liner notes including English translations. The origin of each song is also reported (mostly Irish, Scottish, Gaelic). Listening to this album instantly brings me back to the misty Cliffs of Moher or to the majestic Isle of Skye. It is gorgeous."
5,Original story arc ends,"Beginning with the very comical story of the ""fair Trial"" (featuring Sebastian Cabot as the overeating judge who beats Sgt.Garcia in an eating ""contest""), this selection takes us to the end of Monastario's reign and sets up for a new storyline. In an already great series, this is an excellent sellection of episodes, better than the first DVD. Worth every penny, and lots of fun."
3,"A Step Down from ""Painter's Pallette""","The good news is, this album has some of the most pleasing tones I've ever heard from any band, anywhere. The attitude of the guitar tone and recorded drum sounds are top-notch, perhaps even unparalleled.The bad news is, it's nowhere near as good an album as ""Painter's Pallette,"" which really showed promise as a cutting-edge art-metal band in the making.The best tracks offered here are ""Crystalline Whirl,"" ""I Killed Rebecca,"" and ""New Disorder.""Honestly, I rarely listen to this disc, but I'm also glad I own it. Despite its shortcomings, it's well worth having if you like this sort of off-kilter aggression.Three stars is a conservative rating. If i had my druthers, I'd probably rate it 3.75."
2,easy grip scissors don't spring back well,"They scissors don't have much of a spring back. I had to oil them to get any spring back at all, and when cutting they don't spring back very well."
2,Play it for the multiplayer,"Gore isn't a bad first person shooter for a budget price, but I found that the gameplay got too repetitive because they only have a handful of enemies. They used the same enemies over and over so your being attacked by 3 of the same enemy at points. Had they chosen anything other than humans, this wouldn't have been as so bad. The graphics are around an 8 for it's time. The multiplayer is the best part of the game, but you have to actually find the few that play it. They tend to be accepting to new players. Basically, if you can get it for under $5, give it a shot. If nothing else it will entertain you for an hour or so."
1,God-Awful Terrible,"This has to be one of the worst FPS's I have ever played in my entire life. It can be summed up as the following;NEVER EVER BUY THIS GAMEEVERNEVER EVERPlentiful bugs, horrible graphics, shoddy coding, and registration that signs you up for spyware all help to make this one of the worst FPS games ever released upon an unsuspecting public.Want a fast online FPS? Go buy Unreal Tournament or Quake 3 Arena or ANYTHING BUT THIS!"
1,frustrating and invasive,"I was looking for a single player first person shooter. What I got was signed up to a lot of online spyware. I did not expect the game to require an online connection to play, and I resented being subjected to a gaming paysite as I loaded the game. Otherwise, the game might have been fun... except that I could not figure out how to save anything.. having to start out from the beginning every time got old fast. I was persuaded to buy the game by all the other glowing reviews; thus my advice... don't waste your time or money!"
1,Disappointing!!!,"This was such a let-down. I Laughed, etc was sooo funny and had great music and Ol' Blue Balls has neither....."
5,A classic movie for guys who like movies,Jaime Pressley and Devon Aoki on Blu-ray....'nuff said. The Blu-ray quality is above average. Glad to have this in my Blu-ray collection.
5,Classic Cult Movie,Enter the Devil is a scary cult classic about a town surrounded with devil worshipers/witches. An archaeologist and a deputy tries to solve a mystery of people getting killed one by one. Very scary film. Just don't know who are the ones practicing this cult. Kept in at the edge of my seat.
3,Good,"Does what it is suppose to do. However, if you drop or break, there is no way to re-calibrate the laser."
1,Too Bad - A Disappointment,"I own a swimming pool installation company and wanted this tool only for digs and site evaluations. This unit is not good enough to level actual pool installs. I have an excavating contractor that uses this unit and I liked the fact that all fits into one case, which is why I bought it. Now to the point - I opened the unit and tested it inside my very large building. Out of the box it was TWO INCHES out of level over about fifty feet. The return process went well, but I was very disappointed. After that, I went to my local Spectra rep/store and bought an LL400. It is much larger, but it is waterproof and ruggedized. Anyway, the rep said that the ll200 is just not a durable unit. Too bad."
2,Doesn't work for cleaning paint out of clothes,"I only bought this to try and get paint out of some jeans and socks...I followed the directions on the package but it didn't work at all. Not even a little difference. Oh well. I'm sure it works for cleaning brushes, but once paint dries on jeans you need something a lot stronger than this stuff to get it off!"
5,Operetta not opera,"Stefan Zweig was not a great character builder or a 'complicated story' teller. His strenght was the short novel stuffed with secret plots, unexpected U-turns and stunning disclosures or endgames, coupled with a good psychological insight.Some critics called his work 'a heap of superficial effects'.I don't agee, although he surely has not the depth of a Dostoyevsky.He was more the master of the operetta, not of the opera. However I must make an exception for his master work 'The World of Yesterday'.In a natural flowing and enthusiastic style he perfectly sketched his characters and quickly aroused the readers's interest by posing intriguing questions.The 'Chess Story' is a perfect example of his strenghts, putting the following riddle to the reader: How can a totally unknown person beat a chess world champion?Read this most intriguing and sometimes harsh pearl of a short novel, which combines anti-totalitarian sentiment, haughtiness and a strong will to survive."
3,Questionable scholarship,"The second half of the book is clearly superior to the first half. The lack of hard data from prior to and immediately after the Famine seems to lead the author to some curious and questionable conclusions regarding the economic motivation of the Irish women in America. She repeatedly attributes late marriage and spinsterhood to the ""traditional"" cultural separation of Irish women and men along with the general lack of character of the Irish male. She fails to examine the profound impact of the Famine on women--watching their families and friends starve to death along with forced immigration--and their determination to prevent this from happening again. I found her theories rather determindly sexist."
3,Worth reading,"While I don't agree with everything Ms. Dinar has to say, this is a very solid book and far from being a feminist interpretation, I found it as willing to blame Irish women as to excuse them.As another reviewer pointed out, the second half is much stronger and it is fairly obvious that the writer is most comfortable once she has real numbers to theorize from.The one quibble - due to when she wrote this book (1983), Ms. Dinar feels that schizophrenia is a reaction to upbringing and blames the high rate of schizophrenia in Irish males on their mothers. Since I'm fairly certain that the new research leads to a biological & inherited basis, this would be like blaming Tay Sachs on the fact that Jewish mothers made chicken soup. I think if she had the time a new look at this would update the book wonderfully and certainly make my review more positive."
2,Disappointing third book,"This third book in Childs' scrapbooking mystery series was a real disappointment to me. The dialogue was totally sappy, whereas in the previous novels in this series, the characters spoke in a realistic manner. Here, they seemed almost flawless, and more than a little saccharine.The mystery was pretty easy to figure out and the storyline seemed thin. Aside from Carmela's friendship with Ava, this book did almost nothing to develop the relationships Carmela has with the other characters. The ending (of the book, not the resolution of the mystery) came completely out of left field given the extremely minor interaction between Carmela and another character. I'll hang in there for her next book in this series, but this one really let me down."
3,The Disappearing Groom,"Carmela Bertrand is helping her friend Wren with her pre-wedding party when she discovers that the groom has been murdered. The victim was the owner of a bookstore and he was also developing a valuable computer program. One man tries to pressure Wren into selling the bookstore and another one tries to take over the rights to the computer program. Carmela wonders if either man had enough of a motive for murder. Interwoven with the mystery is the tiresome story of Carmela's off-again, on-again romance with her neer-do-well, estranged husband, Shamus. There are some loose ends in the story and Carmela takes some ridiculous chances such as entering a cemetery along at night, although she admits she knows better. The best parts are about New Orleans, scrapbooking, and some of Carmela's interactions with her friends."
1,Definitely NOT a five-star book,"No way is this a five star book! Character introduction and development is poor, story line is convoluted, character reaction to events is unnatural and unrealistic, and the dialogue is just plain awful. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Decent Enough,"It's hard to sympathize too much with a main character who not only is ""pretty verging on stunning,"" but who has her own business, great friends, and a cute dog, to boot. The only flies in Carmela's ointment seem to be the dead bodies that constantly crop (no pun intended) up. The old ""bad twin"" card was played here, as was the wandering-around-the-graveyard-in-the-dark trick. A little too predictable, a little too light on realistic character development, and a little too cutesy. And would someone please get this woman an editor? ""Courier"" and Ives is just an embarrassment, as is the misspelling of ""zydeco"" in a book based in N'Awlins. Don't forget ""commaraderie"" (is that being on good terms with your punctuation?) and ""mother load"" (a truckful of maternal-types?).All the same, Laura Childs can write -- no doubt about that. I think she just needs to take a little more time plotting and writing to take this series to the next level."
3,Not as advertised,This book was advertised as 'good' but I would have rated it 'fair' at best - it looks like there has been water damage and pages are coming apart from the binding. I wasn't very satisfied with this purchase.
4,Carmela proves to be great once again,"Carmela has done it again get herself into trouble while helping a good friend with her murdered fiance'. The 3rd book had some slow spots, but picked up and you did not want to put it down. We learn more about Carmela and how she feels about Shamus and what happens to them. I will be looking for the 4th book to read."
2,Another Disappointing Entry in the Series,"While Laura Childs has a good sense of locale, her characters are shallow and her mysteries transparent. This is the second Scrapbooking mystery I've read, and I'm not sure I'll bother with another. Her writing style is ineffectual, her dialog sounds as if her characters are uneducated, and her grammar is appalling. Okay, perhaps I'm being too critical of these paperback originals, but the books show no tendency toward improvement. On the plus side, however, I have to give credit to anyone with the determination to get herself published. I only wish Ms. Childs would invest in a grammar course and buy herself a good dictionary."
4,Excellent Game,This is a wonderful game. It really enhances the old fashion way of playing the game. Much more fun and enjoyable. My entire family likes to play this version much better. The DVD is great & the graphics are wonderful. The only bad thing like the original game is that you still need a minimum of 2 players.
5,Great Game!,"This version of Clue is a bit more complicated than the original version. We were somewhat confused at first, but by the end of our first case we got the hang of it. The key is to LISTEN to everything the butler says... it all pieces together in the end. Super fun!!!"
1,Family Fun vs. Family Frustration,"My 10 year old received this game for Christmas. I had always enjoyed playing the original version and thought it would be a good family game. Well, even though we read the directions and were familiar with the game, this version was impossible to follow and have fun at the same time.Mid-game, I logged on to see what other customers thought of the game their reviews were helpful and it seems this version is not appropriate for our family. For now, I think I'd rather get the original version and forget about the DVD version. Maybe my son will want to spend more time figuring out the game when he's older."
1,HORRIBLE!,I love clue however this DVD game is not like the real game at all!! U press one button the whole time an u don't go troughs all the rooms or anything u just go through a secret passage the whole time! Waste of money.
4,Rockin Clue!,"After I saw the advertisement for Clue DVD I immediately went out to buy it. I've always been a fan of Clue and this updated version provides players with some new twists and excellent graphics. While you are playing the game, the Butler and an Inspector often appear to provide you with Clues about the case. Another addition to the game is added locations and having to figure the time of the crime. Any Clue fan will appreciate this version!"
4,Clue DVD GAme a Hit,"Being a Clue fan from when I was a child - I purchased this for my 10 year old. Upon set up we started the game and had to read the instructions about 3 times to understand. Game is similar to the classic in that you need to move to the room that you want to question, however in the DVD game you get to listen to the butler as a choice in your turn or choose to use the secret passage and then as you go along it give you other options. This game is great FUN -- it take a long time to play but that is what game night is all about. I would highly recommend this game."
2,Disappointed,"My father had trouble finding the traditional Clue version for my daughter so he bought this one. Unfortunately, we will need to get rid of this one, as the documentation is so poor that we ended up showing each other our cards just to get the solution after many attempts to make this game work for us. Such a bummer, but I could never recommend this version, even though the DVD itself is well done, because the documentation was poor and seems aimless. Maybe if you throw away the board and really work at making the DVD make sense with the cards, you might get some play time out of it, but I'll leave that for someone at the thrift store to figure out."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,"I just played two scenarios of this game and both of them the DVD just kept saying the same thing. None of the options available in the menu were available which put the game into an endless and frustrating loop. Both times we just went to the ""make an accusation"" stage and conmbined our cards to solve it.COMPLETE waste of money."
1,Clue DVD is very long,"This game is not as fun as the original because it takes too long to play. One game was over 2 hours with 4 people playing. Just as you are starting to figure out the clues, the DVD interupts the game to let everyone know something. We will be giving this game away to make room on the shelf for a game that is more interesting and challenging to play."
1,Disappointing,We were very excited to play with this new game and were unable to get beyond the secret passages.
1,Very confusing game,I was really excited to get this game and to play it.....there were 6 adults attempting to play it and we were all very confused! It was so frustrating that we just stopped playing on two different occasions and I just gave this game away. We read the directions but they were not clear and the DVD is not self explanatory. There are a lot of choices that need to be made and people were confused about the game play. I was disappointed in this game and will just stick to board game clue from now on!
3,A little bit confusing...,The original game was a little bit easier to follow than this one. The graphics on the DVD aren't that great but it's fun.
5,Love this game!,Purchased this game for my MIL who has been a Clue fan for over 40 years. We played at her birthday party. It took awhile to get it set up to begin with but we quickly got into a rhythm with it. Had a great time!
3,One Day,"In just one day of receiving this book, I made my first page containing Cascading Style Sheets. I have read quite a few books explaining the concept of CSS and I didn't quite get the grasp of it. However, as with most of the Visual Quick Start line, I was up and running in no time. There is a typo in the External Style Sheets area that held me up but no-biggie.I did find the area on DHTML a bit confusing but I will keep in mind that this review is being written 48 hours *after* I received the book."
2,This is not a book for professionals,"JavaScript was dragged kicking and screaming into the ridiculous morass that is DHTML. Netscape has since abandoned its support for layers, so this book has become seriously outdated. DHTML is basically a dead end and it will soon go the way of the dodo. Even the tricks in this book aren't supported by newer versions of IE and Netscape, and most of the code examples in the book are incorrect anyway. You can go to the site to get the code for free, so there's no reason to buy a book full of incorrect code. When it was published it had cute tricks, but very few of them were actually practical. The only practical part of the book was the portion dealing with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which are now widely used. There are much better books on CSS than this one...O'Reilly's Definitive Guide on CSS springs to mind...and there are plenty of free web references you can visit to get up to speed on CSS.

2,For the truly un-initiated...,"This book is useful only if you have NO idea about DHTML; and even then, it will take you only a couple of days to get through this book. Clearly, it is not intended as a detailed reference but still, there is precious little content you will need to refer back to (and even if you wanted to, it is not very easy to find what you're looking for). If you're like me, you need more substance to back up concepts and this book just doesn't seem to have it. Keep looking."
3,DHTML Site-seeing for the novice,"DHTML for the WWW should not be viewed as a massive teaching or all-inclusive reference (too thin, too simplistic). But, it is a good book for wetting your feet and getting the saliva glands working for more advanced DHTML books. It is easy to read, has pictures with explanations about the coding, and has a good prep discussion about CSS, Javascript, and HTML. It also has some neat DHTML tricks (such as drop caps and shadowing) that may seem too faux for serious designers. But, for the simple webpage or personal page creator the ideas will seem nifty."
2,"Good for CSS, not any good otherwise","I found the layout and structure confusing when compared to other books in the visual quickstart guide series (which are quite excelent). I'm quite disappointed. Also, mine has a brown cover instead of purple. Is this an old version?"
4,If you need a FAST intro - get this book,"If you are looking for a book that will get you up to speed with CSS and DHTML in one hour - this is the book for you. It has accurate, quick, get to the point examples of how to implement style sheets and DHTML without a lot of fluff. This book is excellent as a quick reference also. I like this book. I don't consider this the best DHTML book in my collection, but when I have a question and I need an answer immediately, I always reach for this one.P.S. Whenever I see a great review. I always wonder if the person who wrote it has a relationship with the author or the publishing company. Rest assured, I have NO relationship with the author or the publishing company or any other entity that could possibly profit from giving this book a good review. I bought this book. And I like it."
2,This book is full of errors but the concept is nice.,The quick start idea is nice as it lets you wade right in and get your feet wet. The only problem is that this book has so many typos and errors in the code that it is confusing. Hasn't peach pit heard of checking for errors before publishing?
4,"Good start-up- acurate title, just a touch out of date","This is a very good book for getting started with DHTML. It covers all the basics (CSS, CSS-P, etc.). It is, however, a little dated since HTML 4, CSS2, and the W3C DOM standards are being implemented in the latest browsers. Don't get discouraged though, this will still introduce you to the basics.I would highly suggest reading PeachPit's VQS Guides on HTML and Javascript first. Then read this VQS. If after your intro to DHTML, you decide to become a Guru- buy O'Reilly's ""Dynamic HTML- The Definitive Guide"". Also, search the web for some reference sites- there are some really good ones for DHTML. Good Luck"
3,Okay as an intro but you'll need more information.,"I like the Visual Quickstart books as basic intros to subjects I'm learning about. This book gave me a general background so that I don't feel lost when I move to one of the bigger books. I do recommend getting another, more detailed book (like the O'Reilly one) to really learn the subject. Also, many of the examples were not explained as clearly as they could have been. Overall, good simply as an intro, nothing more."
2,Useless if you've ever heard of CSS or JavaScript,"I looked to this book to help me learn about how to use DHTML on my sites. Unfortunately the info. inside can easily be found in an hour on the net, and if you've ever had a remote interest in CSS, JavaScript, or DHTML, you're probably going to know everything this book talks about.Save your money."
1,do not buy this book if you are starting out using DHTML,"This is a very dangerous book as alot of the code is not cross browser, there are newer books available that will be infinately more helpful. OK for a home web site, but for commercial programming do not buy this book."
3,Good coffee-table book of heavy metal,"This is a good coffee-table book of heavy metal.The photos are, in their vast majority, excellent. Text is funny and objective, but you will get almost no new information. A discography for each band is provided. At the end, the are superfluous lists of ""Top Ten...""As for bands included or not, the writer himself makes it clear, in the introduction, that some of them were included by ""order"" of the editor. This is the only explanation for the inclusion of a lot of obscure bands that, coincidentally, were relatively new at the time of the publication (2003).THis is far from an obligatory acquisiton for metal fans, but it won't hurt either."
3,Worth buying for the pictures alone...,"Lots of info (and, unfortunately, dis-info) in this book; I won't belabor the many excellent points already made by other reviewers regarding that issue.However, the photos alone more than make this book worth purchasing. I bought a used, like-new copy for less than ten dollars. Do the same, and I doubt you'd be disappointed."
3,Take back,"I reviewed this book and gave it five stars. I recently got more into metal, and realize this book has some major bands left out. Some big names that are included, but they have rushed the biography and alot is left to be desired; Check out White Zombie and you'll know what I mean. Encylclopedia of Heavy Metal? No. Enclyopedia of Hard rock and some metal is what it should be called."
2,"If you have the attention span of a sperm, this is for you...","This book is a very weak ""encyclopedia"" of ""heavy metal"", and would have received only one star if not for some nice pictures. Absolutely no depth to the snippets about the bands; this may as well have simply been a list of the bands, which the author states in his Introduction that he specifically DIDN'T want to create. Pretty ironic, huh. As others have mentioned, listing bands like Cheap Trick and Queen as ""heavy metal"" is fairly preposterous. Influential? Sure. Do some metalheads like them? Sure. Metal? Hah!As someone who is teaching a college-level heavy metal history class this fall, this book simply doesn't come close to cutting it. For grade-schoolers, it might work. Give me Ian Christe's ""Sound of the Beast"" over this book any day of the week."
2,not complete nor correct,"this book is good for people that are new to metal and dont know much bands but, this book barely has anything. And even about 1/6 the bands in here arent even metal. SOME ARENT EVEN ROCKkid rock??? insane clown posse??? janes addiction???come on now, alot of classic metal but none of the real metal"
4,Incredible fun for us old metal heads!,"I, like a lot of the other reviewers, simply happened upon this book as I browsed the bookstore. I've read quite a bit of the metal biographies through the years, so I'm always on the lookout. Daniel does a great job in giving us the basics of these bands. I was familiar with the majority of them, but some of them I simply hadn't heard about in years-distant memories from an article in a used copy of Circus magazine. To his credit, the author admits that certainly the book isn't a definitive, comprehensive listing of all metal bands, hell, probably some of the best metal bands played in garages, never got their shot and remain in anonymity. It is a big-ass book, but if it wasn't, you wouldn't get to enjoy all of the cool glossy photos from back in the day!The book is well written, very funny, with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor that those of us from the generation will enjoy.~""The Gods you worship are steel, at the altar of rock and roll you kneel"""
3,Well..,"This book is quite well written and had some good information/photographs and such. They didn't have many heavy metal/death metal/polka metal bands I listen to (I.E. Dark Tranquillity = Melodic death metal) However, I did not enjoy certain areas of it due to sheer.. unintelligence? Limp Bizkit is not metal, they are MTV produced overpopular crap. Jimi Hendrix was amazing, but he wasn't heavy metal, at least in my eyes. Plus, what was with the Dio foreword? Dio is horrible. Overall, the book was average compared to my usual reading materials.Cheers,Anne"
5,A Shattering Finish,"If you have followed the previous novels, Attack By Fire will leave you an emotional wreck. Just like the real thing, the anxiety, uncertainty, and impending doom hanging over the men of Charlie Company will leave you unable to turn away from the book until you know how it goes down. This is a well-researched work that is as battle-tested as any combat fiction out there. It's not pretty, there are no neat ""everything comes out all right"" touches, and Miss Manners is no acquaintance to these characters, but this is probably the definitive book on tankers in combat. Read all three Armored Corps books, and hang on."
2,very institutional dependent...,"nothing at our center is conducive to the material in this, so depending on how things run at your school/hospital, this may be very helpful or totally useless. probably more like the latter since the author is pretty old school and practices are changing/advancing rapidly, esp with emr's."
2,don't buy this tarascon title!!,"This book really does not tell anything a 2nd year PA student or 3rd year medical student doesn't already know. Don't waste your time on this one. Tarascons other books; Primary Care, ER, and the Pharmacopia are descent toilet reading though."
2,"Patti's Gospel. . .Go live, Miss Patti. . .go live!!!","After reading what Patti has said in concert about not judging her, I respectfully withdraw my original comments about the album. As usual, Patti's big heart. . .and big mouth, win me over, no matter how much I might find lacking in her recordings. I strongly believe she should do a live gospel ablum/CD compilation a la ""Going Home to Gospel."""
3,Maybe The Wait Was Too Long,It is amazing that The Legendary Patti Labelle waited so long to record a gospel album. I mean I have been to a dozen of her shows and when the gospel starts pouring out of Patti's voice she can't be stopped and the house is jammin. She is so spiritual and I remember she said on the Oprah show in 1997 that she was working on her gospel album as we speak but who knew it would take 9 years to finish. I love Patti but the production on this cd is weak. Her voice is not on the front lines as it should be. I wish her better producers becuase she still has it!!!
3,Patti & Gospel,"This is an interesting CD for Patti to put out at this point in her career. I am not fond of the first track ""Did You Pray Today,"" but ""Walk Around Heaven"" & ""I Love Him So"" moreso seem like the type of gospel music that I expected from Patti. Her voice is great and it shows very well on songs like ""I Love Him So"" & the excellent ""You Are My Friend."" Although this is a gospel album, there is still a hint of the R&B/Soul flavor that embodies Patti Labelle, most notably in ""Anything"" with Kanye West. This cd may further blur the line between gospel and hip-hop, but I'm not sure that's not what Patti wanted. If she were to do another gospel album, I would like to see her assert herself and do gospel hymns and more traditional gospel. Otherwise, she should maintain with prodcing love songs that soothe the soul."
3,No Patti... Noooooo!!!,"I know for a fact the even at this age and stage in her life and her carreer, Patti LaBelle can do MUCH better!!!I don't know what to say about this project..... It's a..... Dry run. I really believe that Patti has a Grammy award wining album on the way VERY SOON!! This is just for fun. But one thing its does do, is show her vocals are still there, which if it does nothing else is a good thing. My favorite tracks are ""You are my friend' and ""the Lords prayer"
2,You better buy one of her classic albums!,Ms. Patti can do and will do much better than this. This is just a cheaply produced quickie on a small label. She'll most likely be back with a decent fullblown product soon.
3,Patti and Gospel = ??????,"I think Patti could have chosen better songs for this CD. The first two songs are below average and then the CD kicks into medium drive. ""Walk Around Heaven"" is good and a few of the others. The hip hop song with Kanye West is so so at best. Overall this album is just plain average. This is not an album I would go out and buy again."
3,Cute but a bit flimsy,"This is a cute costume but, like the other costumes from this company, sizing can be both small and large. We had a problem with fraying at the armholes and bodice causing separation of seams that were hard to put back together. I think this is good for a Halloween but won't last much after that. It rips apart easily at the netting."
5,Great!,"Great reading that's needed for today's youth!I am still reading it, but so far it seems like a good wholesome story for everyone to enjoy. I look forward to reading it again with my grandchildren when they are old enough."
5,Delightful horse story for elementary school readers,"Delightful horse story, perfect for any child who dreams of having a pony to love. Jeanne Mellin's illustrations are charming and really capture the sweetness and sparkle of Cindy and her pony. The book is well-written with lively characters, vivid descriptions, and a surprise ending.The glossary with both equine terminology and general vocabulary make this an excellent book for an elementary school reader."
2,Not a great quality item,"The first time I used this brush, bristles were already coming out and onto my work, which I had to remove with tweezers. For the price, not a good purchase. I was using an acrylic water based paint and not an oil ..."
4,JVC CHX1500RF,"Product came as described. The connections are easy to figure out.However, the manual is very difficult to read/understand (even the one on-line)Even the power wires connections are not mentioned in the manual.I figured it out by reading other JVC manuals to figure out which one is switchedpower and which one is permanent power.So far, it's working perfectly. I bought this changer after having terribleexperience with those wireless FM transmitter."
1,narrow scope,the product was returned because it fit only a few of the manufatures products to be exact 3. i have reordered a different product same manufacture but 70 dollars more that will work with other products universally. The information was minamal and if I had not brought the more expensive one I could not have returned the one I originaly purchased.Tim 201681-2852
3,Chantilly perfume,"Ordered 3 bottles. Very good price. All bottles came in with lids loose, and package soaked with perfume. Two bottles had 1/2 left in bottle, one had 2/3 left in bottle. Will not order this again."
4,ELA test primer,"A nice book to prepare for the ISTEP ELA tests. It gives concise reviews of what kids needs to know, so you can check their readiness. The test taking tips are very useful for first-timers to raise scores. A very helpful warm-up for both parents and kids. Note that such a thin book cannot enhance kids' reading skill significantly. That requires daily learning in school and study in home. There is a nice web site http://www.beestar.org you can use weekly to assess your child's skills step by step. With the fundamentals in place, this book does a good job of maximizing the scores."
3,POP ART Queens set,"Mainly Juice Crew jammies here, Pop Art was the start for Roxanne Shante, Salt-N-Pepa, MC Shan, Marley Marl and Craig G. just to name a few. Here are the start of their arts. While Marley Marl dominates production on all tracks except Salt-N-Pepa's ""The Showstoppa"", this disc is far from weak."
3,twin guitars and drums make a fantastic sound,"They make a fantastic music. British fantastic heavy metal band was born in 70's,like a QUEEN. Perfect harmony and twin guitars and drums make a fantastic sound. Please, listen their wonderful music. Truth is over there."
1,Misinformation,Christopher Hitchens is a columnist for Vanity Fair and should stick to that. Need I say more?
1,not worth the paper that it is printed on...,"What trash and aimless drivel. You'll find more truth at a liars anonymous gathering. This book is not worthy of a long retort so I will simply say that it is TRASH! There, I've done it now. I've insulted trash. I didn't think that was possible..."
5,The Complete Resource Book for Infants: Over 700 Experiences for Children from Birth to 18 Months,"Great book. It gives great ideas to do with infants, for both teachers and parents."
1,Absolutely Dreadful,"This is possibly THE worst DVD ever on the this most amazing topic. I am not sure just how these producers managed to make it so tedious, and showed pictures of the Challenger tragedy while talking about Columbia TWICE. It really is very poor through and through. DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL DVD."
1,DO NOT buy this film!,"This video may possibly the worst documentary of it's kind ever made! The narrator of this video speaks with soft and lifeless tone. Boring through and through!I had to struggle to sit and watch this film after 10 minutes and in the end I given up. Put the DVD back into the case and never touch it again EVER!Whatever you do, DO NOT but this film. There are many other documentary videos that WAY more interesting than this one!"
1,NASA Unauthorized: Unrevealed Secrets of Space (2005)-Don't even think about buying or renting it!,"Do not buy NASA Unauthorized: Unrevealed Secrets of Space (2005)- This film should be banned and taken off the free market as it gets space history almost entirely wrong! As said before, the narration does not match the footage and the information presented is just wrong, and probably through plain stupidity!Someone has tried to assemble a soundtrack that might have have been scripted by any high school student with a very weak background in space history and a small staff of translators to translate this missinformation for the world market.Parts are often repeated, the wrong launch vehicle and satellite are shown during the narration, footage is repeated, and contradictory information stated. I can't say enough to warn everyone away from this amateurish production. Amazon, I am surprised at you for continuing to make this selection available!"
1,DON'T BUY - unless you need an empty DVD case,"Don't Buy This...I'd select ""0"" stars if I could. Unfortunatlely, I bought it in a bundle with a bunch of other space themed DVDs without reading the other reviews. The facts are inaccurate, the footage is constantly repeated and doesn't match the narration, and the narrator can't even pronounce names and facts correctly. It's produced by ""SHAMI Productions."" It's a SHAM-i alright. I wouldn't buy any of their products after this. I watched about half before throwing it in the garbage."
4,"Fairly conventional for Kirk, but solid.","Cut in 1961 this cd features the unique Roland Kirk backed by Brother Jack McDuff on Hammond organ, Joe Benjamin on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. The material is fairly straight ahead music highlighted by the phenominal one man horn section, Roland Kirk. Playing tenor, manzello, strich (sometimes at once for the uninitiated), flute and even a whistle type siren he blows when as he puts it, ""...I feel that the music has reached a certain pitch of excitement..."". Kirk and McDuff both produce exciting performances, with McDuff's funky soul groove hammond complimenting Kirk's horns nicely. This is a solid session from one of jazz's under appreciated masters, and is worth a listen."
4,Doin' The Sixty-Eight = Senor Blues?,"Jack McDuff steals the record and this is up there with some of Jimmy Smith's best work on the organ. Roland Kirk is incredible, too, but listen to the clip of Kirk-arranged ""Doin' the Sixty-Eight"": that's a not very veiled version of Horace Silver's ""Senor Blues"" or I'm a monkey's uncle."
4,A shorter movie guide: maybe only the best movies.,"I have several behemoth movie guides, but Zagat has its own advantages. The indexing of the movies is terrific: things like best movies by director, decade and genre. (Maltin until the latest edition had no director's index! Hello?)Then too, its shorter movie list allows me to page through and see movies I want to buy. (Try that with the big Martin or Maltin guides. Impossible.)So while Zagat is not comprehensive, it is very useful.And read up on how you can be part of the Zagat survey. (I don't know how you could be a reviewer in those bigger books.)"
2,Good concept but poor construction.,"This seemed like a great idea and a great price. Unfortunately, the frame warped and a weld cracked before I had split two cords of wood. This splitter might work alright if you have logs with very flat ends and no big knots but the frame isn't strong enough to handle much lateral stress."
5,A really good tool,"Works very well and will do a good job for you. The only problem I have is the pin that secures the pump is bending from pressure. However, that seems to be an easy fix. Stay within the tools limitations and you will be pleased with it. Excellant buy for the money."
5,Fantastic Log Splitter,"Fast delivery and I must admit I was very skeptical but it works, I am able to easily get it to where I want it, holds the log easily and it is very easy to split it. So far we have had no problems splitting any of the rounds, even my 11 year old can easily use it."
1,Present sucked,"Poor quality, chain comes off all the time, needs to replace card holders after 2 weeks usage.Sincerely,Upset Christmas present person"
3,"Logo ""Irish Setter""","My nephew has a beautiful zip up sweater and when I checked out the brand it was an ""Irish Setter""......so I looked up the brand and saw good quality looking clothing items..... one of which was a denim women's shirt..... so I ordered it. I'm not going to return it but I didn't expect such a large sized head embroidery of an Irish setter...... also it seems more like a mans shirt with the large pocket on it."
2,Sing-Along-Mike,"I was dissapointed with this product. I am giving only two stars for the look and the recording idea. You can sing along with the song, record your voice when singing, but it will not record the all song just half. When using the microphone you can not hear your voice, which I was very dissapointed, that is not fun and I ended up returning this item. I bought cheap microphone ($1.50) from Target and it has an ""Echo"" built in it and we are much happier."
2,Priced just under bothering to return,"Nopee, on the Okiedeoke. Ordered it for 3 y/o daughter for Christmas. Tried to image select 'pink' one before adding to basket, but alas a blue one showed up. No matter, also have 3 y/o twin son, both would end up playing with it anyway. The amplifier 'works' if you place it touching both lips and then just barely noticeable. The provided songs are OK, but as others have mentioned one can't sing along with them it is an either/or option. Plus, if you start pushing buttons too fast it sort of locks and does nothing, off/on brings it back after a while(not a battery issue). The kids really try to like it, but there is not much difference between it and running around with an empty papertowel tube(better amplificaton). Enough said. Just wish there was a simple, non character promoting, cordless, fairly priced microphone that could satisfy the budding singers and monologists out there. I digress."
1,Major disappointment,I was very dissatisfied with my purchase and would have returned it if the packaging had not been destroyed in opening. The microphone did not project the voice at all. I thought it was way overpriced for what I got. I just cannot stress enough how disappointed both myself and my grandson was with the performance of this item.
2,"The microphone does not amplify the voice enough, even when the volume is all the way up.","The music is ok, but I wanted it to amplify one child's voice so that he/she could be heard above other children in the choir, and the volume is not high enough at its highest for that to happen."
1,Piece of Junk,I could have found something better at the dollar store I am sure. I am annoyed because first it does not work at all. We tried 3 sets of brand new batteries all to no avail. It was a gift or I would have returned it immediately.Do not waste your money- try something else.
2,Not as good as I expected,"My daughter has had this for almost a year. It is still working but does not get used very much. I was wanting to get a microphone that could record her singing so I got this but am very disappointed regarding the recording. It only records for a short time and it is not long enough to even get through a whole song. There is some amplification but have to make sure that the bottom part of microphone is turned the right way for it to work. The very bottom of the microphone turns which I guess is the on off switch for applification, which might be why so many people have problems with it if they don't realize that is how it works. However even with it on it is not very loud. My daughter likes the songs that are stored in the microphone so that is really the only thing good about it. It is fine for a play microphone but if your wanting something more realistic than don't buy this."
2,Not completely as advertised,"I bought this from Target ($10) for my 2 year old grandson. He loved marching to the tunes, and it does record his voice. However, it does NOT project his voice at all! I tried it as well. I had to put my lips right on the opening on the top and yell... my husband said it only changed the sound, but didn't amplify at all. I took it back and I'm very disappointed."
1,Doesn't amplify,"I wanted to buy this product and if I'd only paid attention to the product description, I would have--but I went to a brick-and-mortar store and discovered this microphone doesn't actually amplify--it plays songs and records your voice but does not amplify. So if you're a kid pretending to be a rock star, what's the point?"
2,Did not last long!,"Microphone was barely used and did not last long! My daughter played with this tory just a few times. She is not one to be rough with her toys, and it gave out very quickly. Batteries changed etc... and it still sounds like it is underwarter! Not sure I would recommend just because of the durability, other than that I think its a great concept. Maybe buy it at a local store so you can return easier if there is a problem."
1,Cheaply made,I was disappointed when I received this product. It is cheaply made and does not amplify voices as it claims to. We are returning this item and will buy a microphone that is better made.
2,Negligible Amplification,I purchased a Sing-Along Mike for my 2.5 yr old grandaughter expecting it to be able to amplify her voice. There is very little amplification. I called Parents & they readily replaced it & the replacement also has little amplification. The other functions work & she does play with it some.
2,Just bought this for 9.95 elsewhere...,I looked around before placing my order with Amazon and found out that the exact same product is being sold at sensationalbeginnings.com for 9.95 (!) and just bought it through there.
2,Just okay,"This is a little disappointing in terms of voice amplification. That aspect of this toy is not great. My kids do have fun recording and replaying their voice, but as a microphone it's quality is poor."
3,Secondary air pump,Had received the pump quickly but do to the poor packaging the metal housing that holds the vibration damper was broken off.Amazon was fast with a replacement but that came through with a broken electrical connector very bad packaging. I brought the packaging issue to there attention and they said they would work on it. I was able to swap the good electrical connector from the first damaged pump to make a good one; glad I didn't send it back right away.
5,Fit great,Was a perfect fit. Only took 10 min to do the job. If you are a tech by triad this is a very easy repair.
3,no difference,"I don't notice a difference, good or bad, after taking these for months. Maybe it's just me, maybe it's not."
4,21st CENTURY CHRISTIAN GRUNGE BAND,"At some point in time there was a last company that made buggy whips...This is perhaps one of the last bands to play grunge music, a sound that had been dead for half a decade. Monday Morning played it well with the same thrusting tunes and echoing vocals. ""Sunshine"" is perhaps one of the better tunes. There is a video of that tune in the enhanced CD. The promo copy has an extra track: ""Tear Me From You.""Track 5, ""Vanity"" has an interesting haunting tune. Many of the songs sound alike. In reading the lyrics from the enhanced CD, it becomes apparent that the ""you"" in the songs is God as it is placed in caps, whereas ""I"" is always lower case. Many of the songs could be mistaken for love songs. So if you want to listen to Christian grunge and not realize it, this is your band."
5,Been looking for this CD,I have been looking for this CD off and on for a while. I finally found it. This CD took awhile to be sent to me but otherwise very happy to have it!
4,It's good,"This is one of those cds where I had to listen to it a few times to really start appreciating it. I love the first song ""Sunshine"". That's what led me to purchase it in the first place. After listening to it several times, several other songs are becoming favorites as well."
5,Aschwedenbitter,This product is worth every penny. Very healthy and teasty. The shipping was very fast also.
3,Not sure what's in it,"This works for regularity which is how I use it, but frankly I wish I knew what was in it. The mysterious ingredients are standard for snake oil from the last century, and I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be legal to put what they did in it (afaik one of the ingredients was probably a code name for opium) so I'm sure they're using something more mundane here. I'd just rather know what exactly I'm eating!"
4,A Beautiful Timeless Text,"This is truly the authoritive guide to anyone wanting to enter into the journey of contemplative Christian prayer via the Jesus Prayer..The text's language can at times be archaic due to when it was written, but the consciousness, the heart and the spirit of this powerful spiritual practice leaps out at you from the pages..These excerpts from the Philokalia will be a true guide and teacher to anyone who decides to enter this form of Prayer Life..As one of the writers in the text advises..Sit in your room ..the (Jesus)Prayer will teach you everything..These writing will help you listen to the lessons of the prayer..Excellent!!"
3,"Who picked these tracks, anyway?","The track selection on most anthologies/compilations is subject to second guessing, and this release is a case in point. Relying too heavily on the edited singles and vocal cuts (I believe they more or less started the techno trend of calling in guest vocalists for a few tracks on each album, as Goldie, Chemical Brothers, Propellorheads, etc. do), this release does not fairly evidence the high quality of work that 808 State has put out in the past decade -- I generally prefer their album tracks to the singles. A better starting point to 808 State's music would probably be Ex:El or the Utd. State 90 album -- but then, since this disc is calculated to act as an intro to the 808, maybe these ARE the most immediately accessible tracks they've done. But as a long-time fan, I'm disappointed."
4,main ingredient,"thats it and that all, a pure time capsule with lots of energy. Represents what was going down before the ""James Brown is Dead"" era."
4,"Incredible, beautiful, mesmeric","I bought this album because I wanted to own the track ""Pacific"". I had always heard this amazing saxaphone-based dance tune in guides to dance music history, and even in clothes shops, and did not have a clue as to who had made it. Well, you get two versions of this classic tune, including the excellent ""707"" mix that stay close to the original, and an updated mix made in 1998 that includes a bit more percussion. Apart from this track, that sums up the band, you get ""Olympic"", which makes you think you are at an acid-house rave in 1990. The rest is good too, of course, because after all, this is 808 State we are talking about, not Fragma or ATB. I have already said too much, so buy this essential guide to modern-day club music as it should sound (I have not been to a club in a while because I keep hearing chart music after paying a small fortune to get in)."
5,Love this!,"Sent this as a gift for Christmas, and the receiver really enjoyed reminiscing about childhood. Photos and history very interesting."
2,Performance Good Recording Poor,"One of the songs is entitled 'He Looked Beyond My Fault'. It is difficult to look beyond the faults of this recording. The company that reissued this CD recorded from LPs with pops and hiss and poor balance.If a person can not find the same songs on another album, then get this. Otherwise, pass it by.In spite of the poor recording quality; I enjoyed the songs, especially JD's version of Green Green Grass of Home."
1,Stay away this author is not a scholar,"This man is not a scholar, there are much and I mean much better books on manuscripts like Kurt aland Bruce metzger David Alan black Phillip comfort etc don't waste your money on this"
5,DORA THE EXPLORA,I bought this for my twin daughers and they have enjoyed it so much. We even bought assecories that go with it. They love how it talks and plays music.
3,It was ok.,"It's been a while since I've seen this but I do remember the characters and the overall plot being rather interesting. There was just too much comedy, mostly revolving around that dumb little girl. The fights are good, and the female characters are cool. I don't think they ever explained why A-ko is so strong, though."
2,Be sure to read the fine print before ordering.,"""Actual year may vary"", my butt. Imagine my disappointment when I eagerly opened the packaging and it turned out to be a 1999 model... at least get the right century, you con artists. Would you offer a 1962 vintage Cheval Blanc for purchase, then deliver some 1964-vintage swill? A classic 1958 Corvette that turns out to be the 1976 chest-hair-and-fuzzy-dice model? [...]"
1,Scam,I ordered a nickel from this page and when i recieved it i found it was in bad condition. It arrived in a small package and the nickel was severely damaged and almost broken in half. The face was defaced and the building on the back had collapsed. Dont buy this!
5,Consciousness Expanding,"Dr Hackett is a wonderful Professor and also a wonderful author. This was originally not meant to be in a book format but thankfully Dr Hackett has put together a series of letters while on his journey in Japan and Southeast Asia. The letters form a personal dialogue of a young man finding the path. A syncretism of Catholicism and Zen meditation (zazen) is what Dr Hackett was searching for and in the end found. This book is inspiring for someone searching for a spiritual path or currently on. The silent dialogue is what the reader must find and what Dr Hackett is seeking. I can not recommend this book enough, an easy and joyful reading."
5,awesome product,"get the recipe book with it, great tool for those that want to make thier own pastas."
3,Hard to crank,unit moves when using..otherwise makes nice noodles and pasta..word word word word word word word word word word word word
1,never thought i would give a 1...,"if I could not give stars I would. Ran dough through it to clean it all out, then made a batch of pasta to cook for dinner. Before I finished the nob on the side stripped out. REALLY?!? the first time I used it! That sucks! the attachments work great with my hamilton beach maker so I just use that. If My husband had not tired to take it apart and couldn't get it back together i would have returned it and labelled it J U N K! but it made it into the recycling bin instead!"
4,yum,"the machine works as expected and we have enjoyed making many different types of pasta. the maintenance is low, too bad you can wash it but enjoy the machine"
2,Sadly disappointed,Was very excited to get product which quickly turned to disappointment. I have to return mine because somehow metal came off if the roller and into my dough. Handle comes out while cranking and end of handle falls apart. Traps dough in it so it can't be sanitary. Mine is going back!
4,Works well if you use it right,"I got this pasta maker about 2 years ago and have used it 30-40 times.I had a lot of problems at first and blamed them on this ""cheap"" machine.This machine is made in China, not Italy.You certainly should buy an Italian machine if you want the best, but this machine works well enough for home use; and for the cost.I HIGHLY recommend Pasta Tecnica if you're having problems with making pasta with this machine. The book pretty much solved all my issues and I found out that most of the problems I blamed on this machine were my own doing.By the way, don't ever wash your pasta maker, get a clean paintbrush to clean it. Here's the link for the book:Pasta Tecnica"
1,What a piece of JUNK,"I got this as a gift. The second time I used it, it came apart. It is made of sheet metal. It is unstable because the clamp only holds one side down. It is a waste of time and money. It went in the trash."
4,Nice set.,"I haven't had a chance to use this yet but the quality is good. It's heavy and will last awhile. Product description states steel with chrome plating, that's okay with me cause I take really good care of my possessions. I also ordered the separate motor that I believe can go on all their models. It was kind of hard trying to follow the directions, pictures would have been nice...my husband figured it out. Although I have used it, setting up and attaching the motor to it seemed like it would do the job. I am incorporating as much gluten free in our family's diet so I decided to make our own pasta, rather than buying...I can only imagine the money we can save and having fresh, healty, quality pasta going in our tummies...nom nom nom nom."
1,Cheap quality and very poor product,"A piece of this product fell apart while I was trying to make pasta and the spaghetti maker didn't work. I thought it might be a fluke and ordered a replacement, unfortunately it wasn't much better. For the money, this is terrible quality and I'd buy something more highly rated. The ravioli attachment also doesn't work well."
4,V178 AL DENTE 5 Piece Pasta Set,"It works very well but the manual lever has a problem, it is a bit loose and falls all the time"
1,Disappointed,"This machine weighs a ton, so consider return shipping costs if you aren't fully satisfied with it, as I am not...Works fairly well for merely flattening the dough, however the ravioli attachment squeezes literally all of the filling out of the ravioli centers prior to sealing them up, the crank handle constantly comes out of its hole while you're cranking it, and the angel hair pasta attachment spits out a large ""scored"" sheet of pasta that will not separate itself into thin pasta pieces to save your life. I recommend buying a pasta machine in a store, so that you can return it if it works as poorly as this one."
2,incorrect parts shipped,"I just recieved my cucinapro 178 and am already unhappy, I got two of the ""dies"" that are the same, so I can only make about half of the varieties that I should be able to. I haven't been able to test the machine, due to the fact that I'm already going to have to contact them, to fix the incorrect shipping/packing..........off to a ""great start""............"
1,Extremely Poor Product,"I just received this item for my birthday. Upon opening the box I could smell machine oil and see metal dust. After unwrapping all of the attachments, most of them had rust and corrosion on them and were coated in machine oil. I'm pretty sure cooking equipment should not have machine oil on them nor have metal dust. The construction seemed shotty at best. I boxed it back up and requested they return the product. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,No proper instructions,"I probably shouldn't rate this product with a 1 star because I haven't tried it - it may work beautifully and produce an exceptional product. HOWEVER - the instructions for the various usages simply are NOT there. So, I am returning the pasta maker without ever using it. I need to know how to work something before I can use it. I would suggest IF you want to purchase a related product - rather than relying on what you'd receive sight unseen - you go to a local store and check out the instructions in person before you purchase the item. I KNOW that's what I'm going to do - AFTER I make the trip to the post office!!!"
1,BEWARE,"I ordered this on December 27, 2006. It is now May 30, 2007 and STILL I haven't received it! Yeah, I could have cancelled the order, but I just thought I'd see how long the delays would continue. NOW, I'll cancel it. BEWARE of buying this item; you might die of old age before you get it!!"
2,"Nice shape, but with a lot of BLACK and SILVER IRON POWDER","This machine can give you a very nice shaped pasta if you prepare the dough with bread machine. However, it will also return you a pasta sheet with a lot of BLACK, SILVER IRON POWDER. Inititally, I though it is a normal manufacturing problem, and it could be cleaned by passing the dough for several times. Unfortunately, I repeated this process for over two hours (more than 50 times), it still returned me the same thing and with the same amount of IRON POWDER. I don't recommend this machine unless you know how to clean it entirly."
1,Poor Quality- listen to the reviews!,"I was really excited about getting this pasta machine for my birthday as I was so tired of rolling pasta by hand. When I used it with a nice soft dough, it got stuck in the machine and the rollers refused to roll. I got the pasta out and discovered that the rollers had bent so that it would skip and roll unevenly. There was nothing that could be done except send it back, overall it is just a very cheaply made machine and I am glad I could send it back and get something that will last. So disappointed."
2,"they have the right idea, but..","The CucinaPro 178 could be a marvelous kitchen tool. The types of pasta cutters offer a good variety, it attaches easily, and stays put while in use. At first it worked beautifully, and we were delighted at how easy it was to enjoy fresh pasta. Unfortunately, within the first 6 months the gears on the lingini, fettucini, and angle hair cutters started to slip. I can still wiggle and jiggle the handle to get the pasta turned through, but it is NOT a smooth operation and it is discouraging to use. The gears on the spaghetti cutter became so out of sync that it is unusable. So far the roller side and the ravioli attachment work okay, but it certainly is not what I had in mind when I bought the set. IF the integrity of the gears could be guaranteed, I would definitely recommend this tool. If you get one like mine, it is a waste of money."
3,Good pasta maker,I've used this several times now and am overall pleased w/ the outcome. The only problem is the crank handle comes out too easily so you have to continue to insert it.
2,Quality issues,"We tried two of this brand. Both had either missing or defective parts. The functionality was okay, but a missing internal screw on one, and a bent part on another made me believe that there are serious quality control issues at the plant.We gave up on this, and purchased an ""Atlas"" brand. I highly recommend the Atlas over this."
3,Unsure right this moment,"I received 2 of these this week. The second as a replacement for the first. Both had the same issue, it ships with the ravioli attachment already ""secured"" to the base. Well, UPS/FEDEX must be pretty rough because both times the wings of the ravioli attachment were bent so badly I could barely dislodge it from the base. The first one was so badly bent it has to be sent back. Luckily, Amazons wonderful customer service people overnighted me a new machine which I received with Saturday delivery. There are insufficient instructions, but do a little research on the internet on how to prepare the dough and it isn't a big deal. I played with the machine a bit today while cleaning it and it seems sufficient. If I enjoy this fresh pasta endeavor I will surely buy a nicer more expensive machine, but this is a good start."
3,Used it once!,I had the chance to use my CucinaPro 178 Fresh Pasta Set only once and I'm a little concerned about the next usage. I only used the Spaghetti cutter but after one usage there was this terrible squeaking noise come from it as I turned the handle that operate the cutting blades. Sounds like it needs a large dose of WD 40 or the blades are about to fall out. Hope it holds up!
4,New at making pasta,"I'm pretty sure the pasta maker is fine, I just have not mastered the art of pasta dough. Mine was too sticky and got stuck in the machine. I'm sure with some more practice making the dough it will be more fun."
3,Misleading facts for extra battery and charger,"Under the heading ""customers who purchased this item also purchased"" it lists Power Wheels 6 Volt Rechargeable Battery and Super 6-Volt Battery Charger. Do not order them for this item. They are not compatible. A battery and charger come with this item."
3,Not good for tall children,"We got this for my daughter when she was 15 months. It took her a little while to get it all figured out, but it has a few problems. First, it has an all or nothing start button. When you push it, it goes. My daughter fell off the back the first couple of times. Second, it has no reverse, so stay close so you can get your little one turned around. Third, it has NO traction. Lastly, My daughter outgrew this toy in less than one year. By the time she was 24 months she was too tall for it. Her knees jam up into her chest if she tries to ride it now. My advise would be to wait until around 2 or 3 and just get a larger one they can grow with."
4,FUN,"The front wheels do not have any kind of clips to hold on to the rest of the toy, so the front wheels keep falling whenever the child lifts up the trail rider."
4,Great toy but has no traction,we bought this for my daughters 2nd birthday last year and she loves it... my only problem is the wheels have no traction...
2,whiplash for whipper-snappers,"I bought this for my 18m daughter for christmas. I think she likes the box it came in better. She hates it because it's got an all or nothing button start that gives a good jerk forward when you press it. Once it's going the steering isn't that great and it doesn't go very fast either. She does enjoy pushing it around though.....Overall, it was a dissapiontment."
2,Low quality!,"The earrings were pretty bad. Scratched up, the backs didn't even come off. Had to throw them out!"
5,WOW!,"First off, if you are not a Christian, you WON'T get it or you will compound it to 'yah right'. If you are a Christian, YOU HAVE TO READ IT! This book is challenging me in many areas that deal with money but also in other areas too! If you really want to be free in your walk with God, you really, really, really need to read this. You will be challenged beyond your wildest dreams. And if you are not, then you need to read it again!Enjoy!"
5,"Wealth Riches & Money, God's Biblical Principles of Finance","I had read one-half of this book when I borrowed it from a library. Unfortunately I did not get it finished before having to return it. I felt the material was so important that I needed to own the book and be able to highlight material pertinent to myself. God is clear to us about what he wants us to do with what he gives us. If he can't trust us with small amounts, how can he trust us with riches. I am praying for wisdom and guidance on what I do with what he gives me from now on, and pray that I don't forget to put Him first."
3,Great book for the BEGINNER!,"If you have used other Office programs before and want to save a few bucks just go through Access's online help and explore with Access to figure how to do the simple stuff. This book has the same explanations and walkthrough you can get from the Access help menu. I prefer reading out of a book rather than on a computer screen however so the book was OK for me. This is really basic stuff, browsing through the book for an hour gave me all the basic knowledge I needed.If you want a more detailed and advanced book get Que's Special Edition Using Acess 2000"
1,Pointless,"These smell bad and continue to, no matter how many times used. They don't stay closed and they don't do what they say they'll do. I gave them to my sister, she gave them back and I put them on freecycle. They got passed around freecycle!"
5,"I know this review is extraneous, but...","I can't help myself. Plato is one of the most insightful and complex thinkers in Western history, and Cooper and Hutchinson do a fine job editing his works. There isn't much filler in the editorial comments, which is how I like it; the introductions are succinct and help the reader gear up for each individual section by providing an overview and asking a few questions to mull over while reading. Great translations, great editing, and most importantly, Plato, all in one volume - there's not much left to say. Definitely worth the investment if you've got the money to spend and a serious interest in Plato."
5,"RE: Not at all what I was expecting. I mean, NOT AT ALL!","This person should learn to READ and pay closer attention! They obviously have issues.This book is AMAZING! I simply love it. I don't regret buying it. I've wanted to buy one of Plato's books for such a long time but never seemed to find one that caught my attention as much as this one had. I don't regret it at all. And it's a great price, considering your getting the COMPLETE works of Plato.You can't go wrong with this book. I recommend this book to all my friends and those interested in buying one of Plato's books."
3,This is not the best version on the market,"I bought this book and used it through a course dedicated to the study of Plato with students and instructor using various translations. We shared the various translations, particularly at many questionable or especially important points. In almost all cases, this version seemed inadequate and lacking the fullness of meaning and beauty possessed by another version that is on the market, but seems not to be on this site.This one will do, if it is the only one you can access, but if you can keep searching, I recommend the search."
4,Excellent Value,"This is a nice volume of Plato's corpus, and represents excellent value for money. Highly recommended.My main criticism is the use of Thrasyllus' ordering, which I think detracts from following Plato's intellectual development. It's a bit of a jolt to leap from Apology to Euthyphro to Phaedo. However, there is probably no perfect system of ordering the dialogues."
5,This is it,This is the edition I used in college. It is the most thorough reference on Plato that I think exists and helped me get through a number of courses. Plus for all who are interested in philosophy it is an excellent introduction without being intimidating. I highly recommend this version to all.
3,"Somewhat slow, but not bad.","While I didn't find it as ""boring"" as the other review, it was somewhat slow. I think it would have been better had it been half the length. It is over 3 hours long. One word of warning to those in it for Claire Forlani's nude scene, for some reason they felt the need to edit it out. While most everything else remains intact. (Although, I never saw it on TV, so I don't know for sure)"
2,disappointment,If there is anything I hate its when a movie is unrated but edited anyway. The shower scene is edited to remove the nudity. Do not be mislead by the unrated status.I would rather eat a veggie burger by mistake than buy this movie.
2,Boring,"A Russian mafia boss has a nuclear suitcase bomb and some terrorists want to buy it. Dougay Scott plays a minor diplomate who is the go-between guy, but also working secretly with MI6. Interspersed are frequent flashbacks to the death of his son from drowning in his swimming pool. The action sequences are amateurish, the plot is pulpy and way too long, Dougay has very limited acting skills, etc. In all, a dull movie."
4,Interesting but US-centric,"It is an interesting tome though I must confess that I read it after I walked the aisle, and after we bought our diamonds! Since it is US-centric in its information and guidelines, I would say to couples like us - in Europe - this provides a very handy thought structuring input provider. The guidelines are broad and with a little research one can use it for one's specific country context. The tone is friendly and the subject knowledge of the authors comes through as well as their effort to make it idiot-friendly (no offence to anyone!). I would recommend it and my husband is next in line to read my copy."
2,Provides little helpfull information.,Everything in the book is plain common sense. May be helpfull for people who are single and are considering marriage. Help those who haven't thought about the finance part of their relationsip. But established couples should have figured everything in the book already.
4,Great Ideas!,"This book contains truly great ideas. I had never considered ""fake"" flowers a viable alternative to fresh cut until casually perusing this book at the bookstore. Great photography, consise directions. My conclusion on fake flowers changed. Aside from being cheaper (especially in the long run!), faux flowers can be glorious. the degree of control you have over the colors, shapes, and combinations can be overwhelming. This book helped me make sense of it. Some great ideas in here. Simple or complex, bold or understated, i enjoyed it."
2,Simple to a fault,"Ordered this book to help me create simple arrangements to display in my home. Found few arrangements to choose from, and most of those were not very creative and a little boring. The best arrangement is on the cover - not worth paying the price for the entire book."
2,"Good material, bad music","I had high hopes for this book after reading the reviews. To be honest, I was pretty disappointed. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of great concepts in the book but the musical examples are lackluster to say the least. The author's musical lines may be designed to illustrate certain ideas but they don't sound very good. And that makes it very difficult to want to spend the time to emulate it. This book is great if you want a broad conceptual approach but if you're loking for great sounding lines that you can use, this won't fill the need."
3,a mixed bag,"This book starts out with a great chapter on Linus Pauling, and four or five more fairly compelling interviews. However, the author seems to have some strange fixations that damaged the reading for me. He'll be interviewing a world-class cosmologist and will suddenly start asking very mundane questions about Mars that any reader could inquire about in text books or from myriad other sources. The author does a great job talking about God, religion, and philosophy with these scientists, but then will diverge into some bizarre topics, like ESP and hypnosis. I mean, are ESP and hypnosis really that interesting? It seems these issues are brought up in almost every interview. It's quite distracting after a while.I might rate it a 3.5 stars. There are some truly excellent passages with profoundly interesting conversation. If you are doing serious research on any of the subjects, it's probably worth reading at least that chapter."
5,Fantastic book,"I wish this book was available when I went to college. We studied a lot of the things John Gribbin talks about. But it was presented as something very abstract, ""pure"" advanced math without any connection to the real world around. As such it made for a VERY boring subject and torturous four years.I am truly amazed at how seemingly easy John Gribbin can take the same subject and explain it so eloquently and in very practical terms! In my view this is a perfect example of a great book (see Mortimer Adler's ""How to Read a Book"", a must for anyone who wants to read analytically) - it can teach most people something new and make your brain work at it.Finally, I would not have stumbled upon this book if it wasn't for Charlie Munger (of Berkshire Hathaway fame) and his annual book recommendations at BRK's annual meeting. He is a wise man and this was a proof that it's worth listening to anything he says."
3,Unengaging Thesis,"I came to this book via a recommendation by Charlie Munger, and while I can appreciate why he would like it (as the book is very multi-discipline), I found the central thesis to be a little weakly supported by the material. It's a book on chaos theory, yes, but it sometimes feels simply like a summary of some disparate areas of study (astronomy, evolution, etc)."
4,relief for cabin fever,"Got cabin fever and wish you could go fishing in mid-winter? This video game can help you. It is annoying when trying to cast and will hesitate occasionally when it needs to load information from the CD. However, and surprisingly, the drag feature helped me with real-time fishing. I learned how to play the fish instead of strong-arming it and therefore have less line breakage.The many lakes and levels of play will keep you entertained for hours."
5,Love the Sharpies,"Delighted and overjoyed that I could purchase Black ""Sharpie Calligraphic Water Based Markers"" in quantity.They are only available in multi colored quantities at office supply stores.Shipment arrived promptly. Markers are great quality. I make about 40-70 hand lettered name tags each week.Thanks."
5,Special pens,I use these calligraphy pens daily. They are an important part of my work. They were delivered promptly following my order. Great price.
5,Markers are fun1,"I love to doodle. This makes calligraphy possible - if even on a just having fun scale.I have them stashed all over, where I will likely be able to use them. Even for work to make labels, notes, a little more personal and fun."
4,crisp lines,Gives clean lines and writes very clearly. The standard sharpies lost their sharp point quickly these hold up very well.
4,"Handy, Great for Practice","I have always avoided felt-tip calligraphy pens because of fuzziness of the line, but I like these for practice. They do not dry out as others have. The line is not as sharp as a metal nib, of course, but with the right paper it leaves a nice, sharp edge. I can keep it in my pocket and doodle with it or write impressive (if large-lettered) notes. The line is dark enough for me even though it's water-based."
5,Pens,It took me forever to find these pens. I use them at work and none of the stationary stores carry just the black; only the multi-colored 5 pack. Thanks.
4,High school is tough enough,Lord of the flies is a tough read due to the content. The symbolism is even tougher. The Cliff Notes helped me pull out things I had not seen on my own.
3,"love how it looks, but the spouts leak at the bottom.","the spouts on the two bottles I purchased leak around the bottom (where the spout meets the flat part). Other than that, I love their look."
3,Color not as shown,"I was disappointed when I opened it because it is not the same ""multi color"" as shown. It is all one solid color closest to the bottom part of the colors shown in the photo. I wanted it to use as a dish detergent dispenser. It is such a translucent blue that the orange shows through it. It's pretty, just not what I was expecting due to the photo shown with product."
5,Wicked..,"Deese people be beatin on their heart to the sound of their own drum.Shows the multicultural diversity of the musicians featured.As High Tone would say in ""The Orientalist"":(FromBass Temperature)..""DA sound,Da sound,Da sOund.."""
5,very nice bar stools,"I love my bar stool purchase. Only thing is that they were very difficult to assemble, especially the foot rest."
3,kind of sad,"it's kind of sad Dawn wants to leave behind everything and go back to California, but she feels as if Sunny needs her because of her sick mom. Other than that though, she's always whined about the cold weather in Stoneybrook and had bouts of jealousy towards maryanne like about her father, so maybe this decision is best. I used to think Mary Anne was being a little bit selfish getting so mad at Dawn when Dawn was about to tell her, but then again, she should have told Mary Anne first before the club members, so I can understand why Mary Anne was so upset. It's sad to see that Mary Anne has come a long way from the beginning of the series and her life took a turn for the better with having a sister, brother and mother and being allowed to do things, but now a big part of her life is being cut out by Dawn moving away. My favourite part was the surprise party at the end."
2,"Still good writting, but sad","Well the book is just as good as the other babysitters club book, but this subject has always made me mad. I know what Dawn feels like because I live in California and I would never want to leave it...ever. Yet, Dawn was my favorite Babysitter and it makes me mad that they decided to change the series this way.Abbey is great, but I mean the books before this after Jessi and Mal had joined are the real reason I love the BSC. Books 14-88. Those are the most wonderful ones because for the most part the seven original (well not original but you know what I mean.) members are there, and thats how I've always viewed the BSC"
5,"Sad, But Good!","Dawn's really been missing California (where she grew up) recently. She comes to a big decision.She wants to move back..Permenently. She doesn't know how to break the news to her best friend, Mary Anne, another member of the Babysitters Club. Then Mary Anne finds out about it unexpectantly, and her and Dawn have a huge fight. Dawn doesn't know what to do. She knows that she can't leave without being friends with Mary Anne again. Will Dawn really go away.. forever??"
2,Noooo!!!,"WHY oh WHY did this have to come to be?? Dawn is an interesting character but like another reviewer says, she was snobby about New England and acted like nothing was good enough. I didn't care for her attitude. I still hate that she left as she was one of the original members of BSC. The first BSC books were the best. Also, HOW could she leave her OWN MOTHER!!!!??? I could not imagine leaving mine. SAD."
2,she got out of stoneybrook at last,"i used to like dawn but she was becoming snobbier with each book year after year and I always sensed that she always thought she was better than mary anne and felt competitive with her and jealous that she has a nice, loving dad so it's best she went back to where she came from instead of being grateful for a new wonderful family. You can tell her mom loved her so much too but she had to leave cause she was obviously stuck in the past and hated the cold weather."
4,GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD DAWN!,"I always figured that vapid girl would pack it in and head back to the West Coast. I am mighty glad she did. California's loss was Connecticut's gain when she headed west. I didn't like her and felt she was a shallow, selfish character."
4,"Funny, quirky & completey enjoyable","One of the reasons that I enjoyed Purgatory Comics so much is that the characters are completely believable. You either are, or know people just like these--and you don't have to be a comic book fan to relate to the trials and tribulations of these guys and gals (although it wouldn't hurt). This is a quirky story about finding yourself, but cleverly told with humor and--dare I say--intelligence (even though I roared with laughter at the scenes of comic-book reading nerds fantasizing about hot porn stars). This was a well-directed and delightful 'slice of life' film that could never have been produced by a big budget Hollywood production company. Watch it and enjoy!"
1,GARBAGE,this is really dumb.a total waste of time. i thought it would at least be capable of holding my interest. i was wrong . dont waste your time. dont watch really really stupid
5,Birthday Present,"Ordered this for my Grand Daughter's birthday, she is reading the series and loves these books. She isn't a big reader so I was glad to find something she liked."
5,Hoover Critic Debunks Summers,"Academic debunking of Anthony Summers' scandalous ""Official and Confidential"" superbly researched and written by a noted critic of J. Edgar Hoover. Summers' bestselling volume used uncorroborated gossip and hearsay to ""prove"" the late FBI director was a closet homosexual and transvestite blackmailed into submission by organized crime. Theoharis, author of such previous works as ""From the Secret Files of J. Edgar Hoover"" and ""The Boss: J. Edgar Hoover and the Great American Inquisition"", sticks to the facts and uses solid scholarship to dismiss the Summers book as baseless."
5,Great book,"This is a great book that speaks first hand upon the culture of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. It is a great read, especially for those who want to more deeply understand the history of the sorority. Could not put it down"
4,In Search of Sisterhood: Delta Sigma Theta and the Challenge of the Black Sorority Movement,"I am really enjoying the book ""In Search of Sisterhood:Delta Sigma Theta and the Challenge of the Black Sorority Movement."" I have a better understanding of black sororities."
4,This Book with Everything to Know about Delta Book,"Got this book withEverything to know about Delta: an unlicensed historical factbook of Delta Sigma Thetaand both books were informative. I like the secret little things Everything to know about delta book better becuase it is more along the lines of stuff I have to learn. It goes into the founders and their background, traditions, and info on what all the greek language andjargan they speak. I like both books but highly recommendEverything to know about Delta: an unlicensed historical factbook of Delta Sigma Theta"
4,historically and socially insightful,"i think that this book is not only a book about this specific sorority but a historical book that is not to be judged purely by the characters in it. Beyond the fact that this book speaks about the contribution of the members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated, it also chronicles the contributions of black women. If people read this book to find about a membership intake process or about a ""pledge"" process then they are more than likely going to get disappointed. Black people in general should want to read this book because this is their history and we as a people need to grab and hold and digest accounts of days gone by as often as we can."
5,"A wonderful Account of the History of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.","The first time I read this book was Sophomore year of college at Clark Atlanta University. Once I began reading this book I realized that Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. is an excellent example of what a sorority should be. The foresight of the founders to chart their own course and to consistently strive for excellence shines through even in the modern day activities of the sorority. Paula Giddings put her heart and soul into this book and it is a must read for anyone who wants to learn about sisterhood at its best. Although I am not a member, I will certainly make Delta Sigma Theta my first and only choice. Kudos to Ms. Giddings for a job well done!"
3,slightly disappointed,"The book shipped fast. However, there are two versions of this book and I wanted the one with the cover from the description/pic. Nevertheless, I'm eager to read this book and learn more about the organization."
4,Great book,This is a good history book related to a great Greek organization. A must read for anyone interested in this organization.
3,review of delivery and book,"The delivery for the book took way too long. However, the book is amazing and very informative. I recommend that anyone interested in this particular sorority read it and open their minds to what they can gain."
5,Sorority Book,This book was in excellent condition and is a very easy read. I love the information I've learned about the Delta Sigma Theta sorority and I would definitely recommend reading the book first.
2,Hard to Read,"I am a woman searching for sisterhood in Delta Sigma Theta Soroity Inc. A member of the soroity suggested I read this book to fully understand the triumps of the organization. However, I found the book to be very wordy and filled with frivilous information. It was very hard for me to keep my attention on what I was reading. I do think Ms. Giddings did an excellent job researching and documenting the history of the soroity. I was just boring. Sorry"
3,It is a good book but somethings are lacking.,This was a good book but the fact that it failed to mention all of the four prominent Sororities in this country made me rate the book less than it's worth. Also I would like to say that the search for sisterhood/brotherhood is something every woman and man should research in depth on their own.
4,History of the Black Woman in America,"This book outlines the different struggles Black women have had to toil with in this country in modern times. I respect those who show the true reason that it came into existence. I read it in one afternoon, one because I read fast, and two, because it had a central theme, ""Here are women who are dedicated."""
1,Insightful,"This book was very informative as for why black sororities were started and how Delta Sigma Theta was formed. It stressed the trials and tribulations that Delta went through to bring it to its dynamic position today. It also included the hardships that all African-Americans, particularly college students had to face. I am not a Delta, but the book made me consider this sorority in my search for sisterhood."
4,It Helped Make My Decision,"In high school my basketball coach and my English teachers are Delta's and also a High School friend of mine . This book teaches young women who are thinking about a sorority about what goes on and it help them make tough decisions on who they want to be with. This book is a very good, and i would recommend it to anyone in search of sisterhood. P.S. Zeta Phi Beta Is My Choice.P.S.S. Thank you Ms. Giddings."
4,Copasetic Buyer,"The book was in pretty good condition, bought it at a good price, and I received it in a very timely manner. Very satisfied."
5,A Good Book From A Historical Standpoint,"This is a very good book, from a historical standpoint it is really motivating to read about all of these African-American woman making strides within the sorority and education nearly one hundred years ago. The book is not something I could read in one day, or one month for that matter. I would read a little, put it down and come back. It's not quite a text book but their is a lot of knowledge in this book. The pictures are awesome too, as an African-American woman just reading about what these women did so many years ago made me proud. I'm sure the author had access to a lot of documents and did a lot of research in preparations for writing this book, overall it's a good book and someone interested in pledging Delta would really appreciate the contents of the book."
5,In Search of Sisterhood,"This book greatly helped me understand, appreciate, and cherish my sorority. I was introduced to this as a freshman in college when nearly every upperclass women had one hidden under her pillow. I able to gain much information about my sorority and my chapter BETA, that strongly influenced my decision to become a member. I am very ecstatic that a soror would take the challenge and dedication to write such a informative book about our beloved sorority."
2,In Search of Sisterhood/Excellent,"This book is an excellent source of history and information about the sorrority. It incorporates the vast amount of dedication these ladies have for social, political and educational pursuits in the community relm. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Delta Sigma Theta,"I think the book was pretty good, overall in great condition. So much great information and many wonderful historical facts pretaining to African American women."
4,Interested reader,"I bought this book as an interested reader. The book came in perfect condition, but the colors of the front cover were different. I thought I had the wrong book until I read the cover. Instead of it being black and red, it was purple and gold. I'm satisfied though."
3,OK for the price,"Holmes oscillating stand fan is not very tall and the fan head does not tilt up and down as much as it should, but for the price it is well worth it. It is next to impossible to find oscillating fans in a store at the end of October because it is a ""seasonal"" item. I'm very happy to have been able to purchase it via the internet at this time of year."
2,Broke with minimal use,"The fan no longer oscillates completely, turns half way and makes clicking sound; found a small broken piece of plastic on the floor after minimal use (around 100 hours); fan motor still works; I suppose I could walk back and forth in front of it instead."
1,arrived with missing pieces,"This would have been a great buy but it arrived with missing pieces.All I got was the crossbars for the feet and the fan part for the top.There was no middle part or neck, if you will.I guess these companies figure it's too much trouble to send back so I won't because it is, and I have a PVC pole I""m going to use with it's own feet.But it was really a drag to not have the part that makes it stand up in the box."
1,Bad stand and very delicate fan,"This is not a good one. I requested for return , No one responded, even Amazon also not responded to my request.The turn screw of the Fan which supports the height adjustment is not working fine. we are unable keep the adjustment. I just kept in the way as it is.I will not recommend to any one. Please dont buy this."
4,cd=good,"This cd is full of some really good tracks. Good mix of hard/soft beats and ambient/jungle music. Worth a listen for sure, don't know about the rest of the series though."
5,"""You have more love interests than suspects.""","A memorable cast of characters, a tightly written story, and witty dialogue make the latest offering in this breakout series great reading. Fresh from solving a caper involving her hometown and a corporate megastore, amateur sleuth Mara Gilgannon must untangle a mystery surrounding the murder of accused rapist Dave DeVoster, a member of the university men's basketball team, and the cloud of suspicion hanging over a person close to her. The preferential treatment of star athletes, the lingering ties between lesbians and their ex's, and homophobia in college sports are just some of the topics covered in this thought provoking page turner by the author of DEATH BY DISCOUNT. This is a terrific, fun mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed."
3,"Taste ok, other flavors are better!","So I have had several flavors of these breakfast cookies and have to say this is one of my least favorite flavors. I think the flavors that are built on oatmeal are better because they taste like they should, like the oatmeal chocolate chunk with raisins are better than these because they taste like an awesome oatmeal cookie with add-ins and not like a oatmeal cookie trying to taste like a chocolate cookie. The peanut butter ones are three stars too for the same reason. The oatmeal flavors are all 5 stars!"
5,Really like these,"I love these things for mornings where I don't have time for breakfast and want something I can grab and eat while driving or once I'm at the office.The chocolate is very good and doesn't taste like most ""healthy"" chocolate products, though you can tell that what you're eating is healthier than a brownie. :-)"
3,MOLD ISSUE!!,"I am ""subscribed"" to this product to receive a shipment monthly. The first two were fine, the cookies were soft and tasty. The last shipment had mold on every cookie. There are other complaints of mold on here, which shouldn't even be a problem if they are STORED CORRECTLY. These cookies are all natural and need to be refrigerated. I guess no matter how many times people complain to Amazon about getting moldy cookies, they still aren't correcting the storage situation!! So that really bothers me, and I don't think I'll be ordering any more of these until they fix the problem. It's quite disgusting."
5,Breakfast on the go,"I am a teacher and we start quite early. This is the perfect breakfast to eat between classes, and it keeps me full until lunchtime, and sometimes beyond. I don't always take a lunch break. =)"
1,"Cookies great, Amazon not so great.","I love these cookies and have ordered them before, but never from Amazon. Because I was eligible for Super Saver Shipping, my order came crammed in a box with my other items that ended up completely crushing almost half of my breakfast cookies. I would not recommend ordering these from Amazon, unless they are the only thing you are going to order. I have ordered on Bakers Box in the past, and will do so in the future.......Cookies get five stars, Amazon gets one!"
1,Too Much Sugar!,"I was looking for something quick and healthy-but after seeing that each cookie has 22 grams of sugar, I was appalled that it was called ""healthy""! We aren't supposed to have more than 15 grams of sugar for a whole day, and this had 22 grams per cookie! Ugh! Pureed prune, evaporated cane juice, and more, made it very Unhealthy. Healthy would be stevia (which also lowers your blood pressure) and xylitol as they have a ""zero"" count for sugar but taste sweet. Sucralose is Splenda and is really bad for your body as it contains chlorine, and can damage your organs and reproductive functions. If stevia or xylitol was used, you'd definitely have another customer. :)"
1,GROSS!!!,This tastes HORRIBLE!!! COMPLETE waste of MONEY!!!Contacted company to try to get a refund but no success.
3,Great superhero book (minor spoilers ahead),"Ok, so you have new Robin, Wonder Girl, Flash and Superboy along with Beast Boy, and their mentors, Cyborg and Starfire. They take on DeathStroke, find out what happened to Jericho and so on. Art is great, story makes sense and book is good, athough it is superhero product.Three and a half stars and kudos for artwork for ' Kid's Game '. It is worthy sequel of Wolfman/Perez Titans in my opinion, so BUY IT NOW!!! :)"
3,Falls apart,I ordered this direct from amazon and the binding fell apart after one read. Other than that it is a great quick read. I watched teen titans growing up and am enjoying young justice so i picked this up. Id recommend it
3,Graphic SF Reader,"I really didn't expect to like yet another New Titans at all, after the goodness of the Baxter stuff from earlier on, but this is actually not that bad at all. I wouldn't be running out to get them the second they come up, but as far as a general comic read, it is ok."
5,simply amazing,"art, story, characters everything is exceptional in this new titans gn. I'm not too keen on DC comics usually but this comic brings things to a new level and totally has brought a new fan to the dc universe. with an amazing beginning and battles between the new versions of the old super heroes, a cloned malfunctioning superman and a cockier robin added to the mix. not too mention all the other phenomenal characters this ones sure to become a classic."
2,Good Price...Great Cast....Poor Comic,"I've always loved the Teen Titans; from their early days with Hawk and Dove up to the Marv Wolfman/George Perez masterwork, I ate up TT comics. When I saw the great price on this book I had to buy it. Unfortunately I was disappointed.The artwork is mediocre and the action is as convoluted as Yoda might be if he tried to imitate the Swedish Chef's speech patterns. There is a very weak story holding the comic together, with most of the comic detailing how the Teens want to be allowed to grow up without grown-up interference.Overall, this comic was little more than OK. I can not recommend this to anyone."
1,The real Teen Titans!,"This is so not the teen titans! Starfirer look like she were in a strip club!And everyone else looked differt!And I dont even know who the other 3 titans are.News-flash the titans have only 5 team mates( Robin,BeastBoy,Ciborg,Ravin,and Starfirer!So with that I tell you you shouldnt buy this for a kid,Buy them the real teen titans their on Cartoonetwork.If you dont see the network on it then dont buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I Did Not Write This Book,"This book is by Pastor Bob Huffaker the Ohio Nazarene preacher--not by Dr. Bob Huffaker the Texas journalist and professor who wrote ""When the News Went Live: Dallas 1963,"" and ""John Fowles."""
2,Flower Drum Song Sings On,"I saw this movie many time when I was a young girl and was captivated by the entire array of actors, music, sets, costumes - you name it! I had a vinyl recording of the soundtrack and knew each and every lyric by heart - still do in fact! What a thrill for me to discover this wonderful film on DVD all these years later and be able to enjoy it with the same pleasure and relish I felt years ago. My adolescent crush on James Shigeta was instantly revived in my first viewing. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a Broadway musical enthusiast."
5,Had to order the DVD!,"I watched this again on cable and WOW...crazy stereotypes, non-PC language, and terrific music. I love it. I have to have it. It's worth the price just to see Jack Soo singing ""Don't Marry Me"". It is rather troubling that many of the stars have passed, but they are all vibrant and sharp in this musical. I always had a crush on Nancy Kwan. She is still around. Reiko Sato, who plays Helen, is wonderful in this movie, but I can't find much on her on the net. Everything about this movie is well done. It's a treasure. I also ordered the soundtrack CD, so I can rip the songs to my iPod."
4,The title rings a bell,Did not see this film with its first release. Quite excited when the DVD was made available. Typical Rodger and Hammerstein film. Expected a bit more but on the whole is was quite enjoyable. One tends to compare it with The Sound of Music (being an evergreen) and therefore you could be disappointed.
5,Perfect movie for us asians!,Grew up watching this and hilarious because it hit some perfect scenarios in our real world of being the first generation born and raised in the states.
5,Good Old Classic,A timeless classic. Beautiful music. I'm a big fan of Rodgers and Hammerstien. I grew up around the San Francisco area and it's wonderful having a movie the represents a time when the city was at it's best.
2,Without widescreen it's a disappointment!,"Producer Ross Hunter lavished some pretty expensive-looking production values and some very capable talent on this film and, as was almost de rigueur back then, mounted it in Panavision and, of course, color. Let's have a DVD with the original ratio preserved, please! Hermes Pan's dance numbers especially (one of this enjoyable film's chief assets) cannot be fully appreciated unless they're seen on the widescreen (or its video equivalent). A panned-and-scanned VHS tape just doesn't do justice to a film which was a fine example of Hollywood professionals working their magic. I saw it first-run, way back when, and despite some reservations, thought it was pretty slick entertainment and would add a properly presented DVD version to my library without any hesitation."
3,A hundred million smiles,"I agree with a previous comment that said this is one of Rodgers and Hammrsteins most underated musicals,and its too bad it had to be released the same year as West Side Story! Although almost 40 years later, Flower Drum Song may appear dated and just slightly chauvinistic, it is none the less a charming 'multi-cultural' piece. I am a huge James Shigeta fan from way back and prefere him as a leading man instead of a WW II villian. Myioshi Umeki(sp) is absoulutely delightful as the mail order bride,and Jack Soo and Nancy Kwan as the comic/romantic team are super.... My favorite number is ""Don't marry me"",but ""You are beautiful""...well... I am sorry I dont remember the names of all the super supporting cast, other than Patrick Adiarte and the younger son.(And didnt he play the Prince in ""the king and I"". A real gem of a musical that somehow gets lost in the shuffle... Definitly in my top ten list!"
4,Flower Drum Song,"I am surprised it is rated only a 2 star on tv. I ordered the dvd because it is one of my favorite movies. Comedy, romance, great songs and dance. The actors are all great. I can watch this movie more that once.Very entertaining movie."
5,No DVD!!!!!!,"How depressing the one movie i really wanted for my collection and no dvd yet, guess we have to wait 5 more years for it to happen...But great musical the costumes were great and the singing dancing wonderful, the romace icing on the cake and i just love everything about it...Great for that movie lover or collection of good classicals..."
4,Searching for a long time.,Finally found this in Amazon. Have been searching for a long time. It's once of those must have collectible musicals of all time. Tks.
3,Not the best from the best!,"Roger and Hammerstein wrote some great musicals but this one, in my opinion, does not live up tor their standards. Maybe it's because of the actors who are too American for an oriental focused movie. If you are collecting musicals, this would be one to have, not for it's musical score and visual entertainment, but because it is a Rogers & Hammerstein production. Nothing else!"
2,The Floweer Drum Song,"A Forgetable movie, where the songs seem to be dubbed over the audio track.While the storyline is OK, the movie failed to keep my attention. Acting styles have changed since this was made.Only worthwhile if you are a musical collector."
5,Flower Drum Song,"Received quickly. I haven't played the DVD yet, but it looks as though it's in excellent conditon."
3,No smoking please!,"Enjoyed the movie with the exception of the overwhelming number of smoking scenes. Since the purchase was for my 7 yr old granddaughter, I was embarassed to have her see this."
