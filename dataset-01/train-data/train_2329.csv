5,Three Lw,My 11 year old daughter wanted this music CD. I also enjoy listening it with her. One of the songs in this CD titled No More is our favorite. We like to hear this CD again and again.We just can't get tired of it.
3,a good debut,Another girl group steps out of the line... and yes they can sing and yes they can dance and yes they hit all the right notes. Nothing really special except this cd mixes r&b and pop very well. The girls of 3lw could be destiny's child little sisters. If you like pop/r&b then you'll eat this up.
4,3LW,"Their new single is not the only good song on this CD, the CD has great songs. Which is not always the case when you hear one of the good songs on the radio and you go out and buy the Cd. The girls have great voice talent which make it all the better. Get it now, it is really good."
3,ABOUT 3LW,"WHAT CAN I SAY...THESE GIRLS ARE GREAT!! WHERE HAVE THEY BEEN. THEIR SOUND IS SO UNIQUE...LIKE NO OTHER. WITH A LITTLE KICK OF BONE THUGS,AND A SOUND ALL OF THEIR OWN, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT THEY WILL MAKE IT A LONG WAY, LONG AS THEIR NEXT ALBUM IS AS TIGHT AS THIS ONE."
1,OK,I think these people suck! Adreinne and Kiley should stay with the Cheetah girls and do that music 3LW should QUIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE CHEETAH GIRLS ROCK!!!!!!!
2,Only for the girls,"The trio from New jersey now famous because it's where Adrienne Bailon got her big break released their self title debut in 2000. The debut single No more (baby I'm a do right) peaked at #23 on the billboard Hot 100 and got plenty of radio play the next single Plays gonna play did not do as well. While Destiny's Child and TLC sold millions of records around the world and charted many #1 singles, the girls of 3LW were unable duplicate the success of their debut Album and finally split in 2007. Bailon and Kiely Williams moved on to other projects including starring in Disney's The Cheetah Girls and later forming the all girl quartet of the same with Sabrina Bryan. Today 3LW is no more and Bailon's solo debut album has been in making for several years. Nobody knows when it will finally be ready. Anyway the 3LW debut album is a good pop album with fun songs for young girls but the older guy's might take a pass on this."
4,Not what i expected,"i brought this cd when it came out. but i really didn't listen 2 it. i mean i heard enough 2 have favorite songs, but just recently some of the songs popped into my head. so i had 2 get it again. this cd was hot"
2,Good in theory...,It is really a lot easier to handle however mine broke after only about a hour and a half of use. The bearing race on the handle portion let lose.
5,Easy to use and works great for dog's nails,I use this with my 10 speed Dremel for doing my dog's nails. The size keeps my hand from cramping and it is easy to maneuver. I use #432 Dremel sanding bands (120 grit) that you can find at a local hardware store. I use that grit on both the small and large dogs. Just be careful and keep the nail pad that you are working on and the next pad out of the way of the band. They bands do get hot. I recommend using the slowest speed until you get used to the tool. I now use the slowest speed on my small dog's nails and the 3rd speed on my large dog's nails.
4,Dremel flex attachment,Dremel makes an excellent product - perhaps they could engineer it a little lighter in weight. I do very fine work and would appreciate something about the size of a pencil.
4,Excellent addition to anyone's Dremel tool,I bought this as a replacement to my original flex shaft. Excellent tool for detail work with the Dremel. Be advised that the Dremel should be hung above where you are working and not just sat on its side next to you. It will perform much better this way.Oh and don't lose the driver bit (little screw in bit) or the tool is useless. Too bad they couldn't have attached it to the assembly somehow as it is a easy piece to misplace.
4,Fits Model 370 to.,I really have not used it but it does fit my older model 370(about 20yo) Dremel tool which for some unknown reason Dremel says it will not. Just thought I would pass that information on.
5,fantastic for wood carving,"great, can't say enough good about this item. i use it all the time now and i don't know how i got by without it."
2,Much easier to grip!,"I do hours of wood carving every day with my dremel, and it began to take a toll on my hand/wrist. With a smaller object to grip, I have more ways to hold it, and get better leverage by having my fingers closer to the tip so my wrist doesn't have to work as hard. The cable can get hot if run at high speed at too high of an angle, but so far no problems have arisen from the friction. Great tool for detailed work.EDIT: 5 months later, the whole thing came apart in my hands. I picked it up to try to find out what went wrong and how to fix it, and it burned my fingers badly. Turns out high speed will cause it to overheat and destroy itself. I'm pretty ticked, but maybe that's just the way these things work. Anyways, be careful!"
3,Ummmm...,"I have never gotten this to connect to the rotary tool I ordered it with, Guess I need to invest in that other rotary to make it work."
3,good tool overall but...,"I wont repeat what everyone else has said about this being a fine tool,It is and my only gripe about it is that it is not really a heavy duty piece. If you try to grind a cylinder head port you will find out fairly quickly that this flex shaft is for light duty only and will overheat and or become disconnected internally. Otherwise it works very well on all manner of things."
5,Great attachment for careful work,With the Flex Shaft it becomes far easier to do fine detailed work especially on small items. The power loss with my Dremel 800 series cordless wasn't a problem at all for doing some simple engraving and jewelry work.Also note that the MULTIPRO Chuck (Amazon B0000302ZV )I bought a few months back works fine with this flex extension.
4,dremel flex shaft,I'm an opal cutter and I started with using the dremel only. Very difficult on such a small thing. Well I purchased the flex shaft and it really gave me the control I was looking for. I've had no problems with it. The only thing I haven't found was the grease to lube it. I will make it clear that I absolutely LOVE my flex shaft.
2,Non-functional,The item came without instructions and does not function with my Dremel driver. It mounts in the obvious way but does not drive the tool. Maybe contact with Dremel will solve the problem.
1,ruined a new multitool,"Drive shaft attachment nut threads were totally screwed up. Managed to ruin a brand new multitool before I realized it. Could have got an ""off brand"" for $10 less but NO, I had to get the ""high quality"" Dremel name. Also thanks to Dremel for having the strangest possible thread on that drive shaft, good luck finding a die. Dremel name is total junk anymore. Look around, there's a lot better quality elsewhere (couldn't be worse)."
5,IF you don't have it you should,This tool is the most important attachment in Dremel's Inventory. All Users should get one
4,Redeaming dremel purchase from amazon,"I absolutely loved this attachment, only problem is that dremel is always sold out of the lube for it and hardware stores dont seem to have the thin wheel bearing grease i need"
4,This book was interesting.,"I kind of liked the book, but some parts of the book wereboring. I think Tom Barry should have told the police on Mouse. Iwouldn't care if it was my friend who did a crime. I didn't want to read the book during English class."
1,I hated Four Miles to Pinecone,"Four Miles to Pinecone was the worst book I have ever read. It was short and boring. The characters where dull, the plot was bad and the writing was awful. There was no adventure. All it was was about a kid's trip to some lake in the middle of nowhere. I don't care about that. It was truly awful."
2,"Lots of stories, not too much practical advice","Due to the fact that it was a new title, and therefore more likely to be up to date with todays issues between DIL & MIL, I was really hoping that this book would offer practical advice on how to cope with, understand and approach my emotionally demanding mother in law. Unfortunately, this book did not offer such advice. There were plenty of stories from other daughters-in-law which did offer some consolation, making me feel less 'alone' in my struggle, but I was really looking for ways to help me 'breath through' or 'confront' the problems that I am experiencing with my Husbands mother.This book would be fine if you just want to hear other womens venting, but thats about it."
4,Great Book...but not what I'm looking for.,"I'm a newlywed and currently have my ""monster-in-law"" living with us. Before she moved in, we were the best of friends but things drastically changed and I can't even manage to be in the same room as her! I'm desperatly seeking some kind of advice and there are no books out there that relate to my situation. I'm only 24 years old and have no kids, so it seems there aren't any people out there that can relate or there just isn't anyone who has written about it yet. This book is the closest I can get. Although it is a great read and has wonderful advice, about 80% of the information I can't relate to. I highly recommend this book but it's not for me."
5,Achoo! Achoo!! What do you need to do?,"With just enough information for a toddler, Germs Are Not for Sharing teaches all the ways to help prevent the spread of illness. Sing a little song while you wash your hands, and then most definitely purchase this book for any toddler or pre-schooler you know.The entire series is just amazing, but you really don't want to miss this particular volume!"
5,Excellent book,"This book is great, we are buying one by one from this collection and my 4 1/2 years old love it. It's unbeliavable how kids pick up things from books. He didn't want to wash his hands very often and the book works great for that matter.I recommend the whole collection."
5,SERIES Winner!!!,"This series by Elizabeth Verdick is terrific. This lesson, as well as the others, teaches children a very valuable skill about germs by using great text and illustrations. It's a winner!"
5,very cute,"I bought this book for my prek 3 class. right on their level, great pictures. I can't wait to read this one to them."
4,Germs Are Not for Sharing,"The book is good, though for my sons (ages 7 and 5), I had wished there would be a little more explanation of the science or a pictorial showing of exactly how germs are spread. Instead, it's more of a ""be clean because of germs"" superficial lesson. The book is good-- I had just hoped for a bit more."
5,Effective,My grandson loved this book and it caused him to be more willing to wash his hands after using the potty.
1,The Insiders' Guide to Charleston,This is not a top-notch travel book. The information was not in-depth or interesting. It seemed to be like a book one might get at a travel agency free (it even had advertisements). I would not recommend this book.
2,Insider's guide??????????????,"Great book for the very very beginner, but hardly an insider's guide.An insider's guide would have talked about slippage/requoting, stop hunting, price shading, and all the dark stuff that really goes on behind the curtain of these retail forex companies.You want to trade forex? First, contact the NFA and CTFC and demand this new and exciting industry to be regulated!"
4,Good Introduction to the Forex Market!,"This book definately gives the reader a good look at the intricacies of the Forex, but it is not the final step in your education of the Forex market. The Forex market is a world unto itself and by nature is a huge gamble for a private investor. This book is a great place to start. The author uses good examples to illustrate his points and doesn't assume the reader has a thorough understanding of macroeconomics."
2,Pretty superficial,"Lots of historical perspective, but lacks specific techniques and strategies. Also pretty dated now. Lots of filler and anecdotes, too."
2,Not worth it,"Of all the books I've read on Forex this has to be the least useful. There is no central theme, no ""how to""....it's a collection of dis-jointed, unrelated trivia about the foreign currency market. Not worth the paper it's written on...in my view. You'll do considerably better reading nearly anything else. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,Forex Disappointment,Real traders are looking for trading ideas not historical commentary. You can get this info from the web. If I wanted history I would go to the library--where's the beef!
1,Garbage,"If you want to learn about the start and foundation of Forex, use Google! It is free and more up to date than this piece of junk. Luckily I got it from the library and did not pay for it.I have been a Forex trader for a long time now and 80% of this book is not relevant any more."
4,Funny but short,"This DVD is funny but leaves you asking ""Is this it?"" Seems like a very short CD for the money."
3,Good Turn Around Time,"I got this in good time. However, not sure how the DVD plays as it is a Christmas gift for my husband. He is a HUGE Kevin James fan and I hate that Comedy Central did not release but a few copies."
5,Hilarious & clean,"This is a great DVD, but instead of paying a fortune, just buy ""King of Queens"" Season One - many of the same jokes and lines are contained in that season's dialogue. Kevin James is hilarous!"
5,I love Kevin James!,Kevin James: I love him. This is a DVD to watch with your parents & not feel embarrassed. He puts out true life comedy that everyone can relate to in a way that is belly laugh funny while keeping it clean for all ages.
5,Hecka Funny!,"Great video Kevin James is very funny. Best Comedian I've seen in a long time. There is little or no swearing so it's good for the whole family, hard to find that quality these day's."
2,"Love Kevin James, not crazy about the video","Kevin James is the best. This video was a disappointment. I didn't even finish watching it. I guess i was expecting too much...wasn't the King of Queens, that's for sure."
1,hack pure hack !,"I had this shipped to London because I love the ""king of Queens"" but I found Kevin James to be the king of hacks .Did you know men and women are different ?that airport staff ask you silly questions about your baggage ?that air travel can be be a tad annoying ?if you didn't then this is the DVD for you"
1,Captain obvious/ Captain no facial expressions.,"This dvd was horrendous. I only saw his show once, and thought it was okay, and my friend lent me this dvd. I was misled to think this was funny in the least bit. He:Makes observations that are simple and not funny.Makes like one or two facial expressions.Has one talking voice, and one yelling voice, no variation...It was sad to see the people in the audience laughing so hard about NOTHING FUNNY. Oh man, waste of my time. Please, don't waste yours. (Or your money. This Dvd is surprisingly expensive...)*Note- My favorite comics are: Jerry Seinfeld, Brian Reagan, Jim Gaffigan, Demitri Martin, Mitch Hedberg, etc*"
1,Fake DVD release!,"I was so happy to have found Kevin James ""Sweatn' the small stuff"" on DVD for a reasonable price. But come to find out this copy had been fabricated. The disk was a DVD-R and the cover was made by computer. Not impressed paying $50 for a burnt copy. They could at least admit that it was not issued be Comedy Central, I think there's a copyright issue here......."
1,Price!!,"Okay, somebody please tell me why this is sooooooooooo expensive???????? That is an insane amount of money to pay for a DVD of someone doing stand up comedy, sure it's funny, I've seen it on Comedy Central, but he wouldn't charge that much to see him live!!!!! WHAT'S UP?????"
3,"if you like King of Queens, you will love this DVD.","Unfortunately, if you are an afficianado of stand up, this may be a sort of stand down. Does he bring anything new to the table? No, not really, but is he funny? yes. What he has to offer is his oversized energy and enthusiasm. He is no Richard Pryer or even David Cross, but if you can find it somewhere in your hearts to just let go and be amused by a light hearted and heavy handed loud mouth then you will find this DVD makes the afternoon go by a little smoother."
5,Excellent,"What a great book! The perfect length for a challenging read such as this. Have a reference library available, this author clearly has fun with words. A great piece of fiction indeed."
2,Misleading presentation,"Don't be fooled by either the title text (...Pull-Stroke Blades...) or by the picture showing four blades, or by the text ""In 21 TPI, 18 TPI, 15 TPI, and 12 TPI blade configurations."". This is NOT four blades, but ONE blade of 18 Teeth per inch. While $9.95 isn't too bad for a replacement blade, the presentation on this page is very misleading. Also, in spite of the name (Tajima), this is NOT a Japanese blade, but is made in China. If you want a Japanese-made blade, you might check out Shark Corp's pull saws."
4,Good movie,"This is a good movie, it is not the best out of the 3 but it has its moments of being great. It does not follow the book exactly but it still holds to the story pretty well."
5,Just what I expected,This was just what I expected for what I paid for. I recommend this item if you just want a regular Lord of the Rings experience. If you want more get the extended edition.
3,Ok wrap up.,"Not the best of the three, but manages to end it all in a reasonably satisfactory way. The battles take up a lot of time and were not the best parts of the film."
4,Gift for my daughter.,"Product arrived on time. Item had a little more wear and tear then I had hoped, but I knew it was used when I purchased it. It was a gift for my daughter and she is happy with it!"
5,Great movie!!,as all of the trilogy in this set it was wonderful!!. I have really enjoyed watching these over and over again
5,Incredible!,"Truly an amazing movie on every level. Great, meaningful storyline, awesome music, epic feel. . .and actually no profane language or indecency (rare these days). Though he didn't intend for it to be an allegory, Tolkien said that Lord of the Rings has a Catholic foundation. A great moral challenge to the times!"
4,awesome movie but with one flaw,"where [...] was Saruman and Wormtounge? they're in the book but for some reason, all their scenes got cut. guess ill have to wait for the extended dvd.but yeah, they movie was amazing. Minas Tirith looked incredible. the battle of pelinor fields was awesome. seeing the giant eagles was great. some things could have been better but still a great movie."
5,worth the upgrade,"Originally, we bought all three ""theatrical releases"" the day they were available and didn't purchase the more expensive extended editions. But this year we asked Santa for all three extended editions, and it was definitely worth the upgrade! Christmas Day: we spent the entire day abosorbed in LOTR. What a perfect day! We'll be giving our old ""theatrical releases"" to grammy."
1,The return of the freaks,It astounds me that there are now all of the these fanatical LOTR fans that know the characters and all the little nuances of the story but have never actually read the books. The third movie was an absolute let down. Why go to the effort of making this amazing book into an amazing movie only to re-write it and edit out parts that are essential to the core chemistry of the books. We live in a world of avant-twits. Peter Jackson should be ashamed to take something this great and re-constitute so he could sell it to all the freaks to lazy to read the book.
4,Hopefully a wonderful movie,"I LOVE the LotR books, but movies are never as good, simply as a rule. But I would give it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the Scouring of the Shire isn't going to be in it (if you've read the books, you'll know what I'm talking about). The Scouring of the Shire is really important to the story, but Hollywood just wanted the hobbits to come home and be happy, although the fact that they have to save the Shire too is a major thing. By the way, this isn't just a prediction, but it says on the director's commentary for The Fellowship (during the Mirror of Galadriel part) that it will be left out. But other than that, this should be a wonderful movie."
5,A short and sweet review.,"Wow! What an epic! In the final chapter, Fordo and Sam make it to Mt. Doom, while Gandalf and the gang fight a huge battle for Middle Earth and for Men!This one is easily the best of of the LOTR saga! It's long, too! 4 hours! Lots of rich lush eye candy, fantastic action, and a huge climax make this a favorite! GET IT!"
5,Love the Movie.,"The Return of the King extended edition is a must have. I have seen both this and the regular and while I enjoyed both, I highly recommend this version. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she couldn't have been happier. As I have not read any of the books, I don't get caught up in all the hoopla. To me, it is simply a great movie."
5,Excelent,"This movie was great to begin with, but now with all the parts they left out put in, and in the correct order, its amazing! It explains things that may have confused the people who haven't read the books."
2,2 stars only for the CG and action sequences....,"Peter Jackson should be strung up in everyone's eyes for this. It is absolutely amazing to me that he can completely cut the last 50 pages out of the book for this movie, and put ""The Lord of the Rings"" label on it. Don't get me wrong, it is a well-made movie, but all of the cutting out of parts of the book ruined it for me.For example, where did Saruman go? He was in the tower, and then he just disappeared, never to be seen again? The book doesn't tell it that way. If I had never read the books I would probably like this movie, but having read them, I stomped out of the theater in disbelief and anger after it was over. If you are expecting a movie true to the books, and haven't seen the movie, save yourself the time and frustration."
3,very little added,"the anticipated additions to ROTK add little to the table. basically, if you thought ROTK deserved all its 11 Oscars and is the greatest movie ever made, then nothing, not even an Orc blade pressed against your throat will make you change your mind.OTOH, if you want to see Gandalf embarassed even more, buy this version, because here, he has his staff broken by the Lord of the Nazgul. Yikes.As for the commentary tracks, if your movie is good, why need a commentary track?"
5,"Return of the King, Good Ending to Great Series","The movie was refreshing (...) The movie took some liberties with the book, but what did you expect. I thought that Peter Jackson did well with the story and the Great Trilogy ended well. Bring on the Chronicles of Narnia!"
5,My Lord,"I have to ask all you people that have reveiwed this, have you actually seen this movie? because I have seen half of the movie in a pirated copy. I didn't get to find out whether Frodo dies but there is a lot of emotions in this film. Its much better than 1 and 2 combined Maybe you think I'm crazy but its true its absolutey amazing. In the two towers at helms deep theres ten thousand orcs. At the Pellenor feilds there are about two hundred thousand orcs. I wont give too much away but I'm telling you watch the movie. Best movie yet? defenently"
5,AWESOME,"NICE......AWESOME MOVIE.........The supreme adventure of our time....this is the movie you want to get...not the theatrical version, you want this one."
4,I preferred the theatrical cut,"I was only a lukewarm fan of Tolkein's books who has been thoroughly won over by Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. The DVDs are much better than most, with commentary and documentaries that are actually interesting. For the first two movies, I even liked the extended director's cut better than the theatrical version, but to me the extended ""Return of the King"" drags on forever. Maybe the Tolkeinheads relish all the extra detail, but I couldn't stay awake through the whole five hour marathon."
5,Lord of the Rings - Return of the King,Fantastic special effects - follows the story so well and brings a whole new emotional level. Music is also fantastic.
5,One of the Top 5 Best films ever! (A non-quibbling purist),"Nothing ever put on film can outdo what your own imagination sees when you read Tolkien's trilogy. I didn't expect Jackson's movies to do that. I hoped Jackson wouldn't get it wrong...and that people who had never read the books would find the films entertaining in their own right.Peter Jackson far exceeded my expectations. ""The Return of the King"" IS better than the first two movies, but not by much, because they're all great: CGI, locations, costumes, attention to detail, the use of humor (watching members of the dead army swarm over a giant war elephant and bring it crashing down), and so many other elements makes this a great movie...possibly the greatest adventure film ever.The release of this movie with its message that nothing great comes without sacrifice could not have come at a better time. The extended editions are worth paying extra for."
1,NO hope,"They cant revive it there is no hope. They strayed so far from the path that Tolkien intended that they would need at least 2 hours with a lot of cuts and adds so I don't look forward to this at all. I love the Lord Of The Rings and bought the books on CD and listen to the trilogy probably once a month for the pass 2 years. So it is evident to me that Mr. Jackson or ""The Book Butcher"" could not understand that evil, money, lust, and other desires of the flesh did not drive Tolkien's creations. But if you don't care about the books then the movie will be great.A 13-year-old purist (who cant spell)Oh yeah, Elijah Wood could not portray a character with depth if his life depended on it"
1,"Horrible, absolutely horrible.","Would one care to explain to me the exact purpose of this terrible film? I found myself overcome with nausea upon viewing this film. I must say, the performances of each and every one of the actors and actresses were woeful, and truly disturbing, in the least. How this truly awful film came to win so many Academy Awards (TM) remains but a cryptic occurence in a world copious with hate. The excessive length induced a severe bowel movement, which eventually forced me to miss the last hour and tweleve minutes in the cinema loo. I must say, though, that I was somewhat glad to have missed so much of this terrible film."
4,Not that much better,The extended edition would be 100% perfect if the scouring of the shire was there. Saruman and wormtongue did not die that way in the book. I have no idea why they would make something like that up. That was the main purpose it was a waste because sarumans death was not as in the book.
5,Best Movie Ever!!!,"Even though it is not out yet, I know that it will be the best movie that I have ever seen. The theatrical version is great and the extended DVD's of the first two movies were great as well. I am willing to bet that this movie will easily live up to my expectations and then some."
3,Ok - but the book was better,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy, was good, although, l much preferred the book versions; the DVD's left me wanting more."
3,Any Questions?,"How do you cut Saruman out of ROTK?Tip of the iceberg, but a fowl wind blows from the West......... more to follow once the movie is viewed. Judging from the woman in West Chester who claims to have seen the film, sounds like the theatre edit cheapened the story."
1,CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I saw this last November at the Theatre with one of my friends, because he couldn't find anyone else to go see The Return of the King with him. Boy,did I make a mistake. Clocking in about 3 1/2 hours The Return of the King bored the crap out of me.It's one of those movies that may have been ok if it was about 80 minutes long. The only good part was when Elijah Wood's character gets his finger bitten off by that creature.At the end it looked like some gay love story, when Sean Astin and Elijah Wood got together at the end, it looked like they were gonna kiss each other or something. Come on, why does everybody think this garbage is so good. Overrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This Movie is More Boring Than Watching the Grass Grow!!!,"This is, without a doubt, the most boring movie I have ever sat through. I may have liked it better if the movie was 2 to 2 1/2 hours I think I would like it better. But WHO WANTS TO WATCH A 3 AND A HALF HOUR MOVIE!!!"
5,Lord of the Rings,The game (mmorpg) is just as compelling and fun as the 3 part movies of the classic book by JRR Tolkien. The Lord of the Rings. It stands alone in originality and fun. A most excellent investment for fun and entertainment.
3,Good but mushy,"Jackson gave the public what it wanted - battles - even though Tolkien never described Helm's Deep and Pelennor Fields in detail. Jackson ignored much of the deeper side of LOTR for action sequences; however, if he had stuck faithfully to the book, Jackson would never have reaped such profits.I liked ROTR for its stellar presentation, especially the dead army, but I disliked it for its Hollywood influence. Jackson strikes blows for woman's rights with Eowyn; puts characters in places they never should have been, doing things they never did; too much Christian Right influence in this picture: Godlike Gandalf talks about Heaven, overt contrasts between evil-black and good-white.ROTR reminded me of Return of the Jedi: It just overflowed too damn much with good feelings and good guy victories. I like a harder edge to my movies."
5,11/5,This movie was beyond great. and jsut for some people who where down about this movie that was no freakin cat lol. anyways this moive was brilliant it had me teary eyed from laughing and crying. it is definently more emotional then the other two. if u even think u liked the furst 2 (heck my mom saw it and she really doesnt like those movies but she loved it.) i think you should really see it i already saw ut 3 times back to bak lol k bye
2,Two Words: Overkill & Excessive,"First of all, let me just say how impressed I was with the first two movies in this trilogy. They were outstanding films and deserving of all the awards they received. Perhaps that is one reason I was so disappointed in this movie; it wasn't nearly as interesting as the first two. The main reason can be summed up in my headline here.Director Peter Jackson made the same mistake he made in the film he did right after this one: ""King Kong,"" where the action was way too much, too the point of ludicrousness and an insult to viewers' intelligence. So was this film, the third in the LOTR series.It was too much action, so much that after halfway through this 3 hour, 20-minute movie I was numb and could care less what happened from that point. I stuck with it, but, overall, it committed the worst sin of them all for fantasy-adventure movie - it got boring. Too much violence translates into ""boring."""
5,"Lord of the rings ,Return of the king","What can one say about Lord of the rings. Great story to end the trlogy. The blu-ray is eye candy, and the sound as well. This is the single edtion. No different then the Box set. I'm one of few that like the theater versions over the directors cuts, but for big Lord of the fans i can see why they can't get enough. 5 stars"
5,Lord of the rings,I bought this ti replace the DVD m grand daughter lost. I am going to buy the other two in this extended format because of added information about the film and characters. It arrived on time and in perfect condition
4,Quite Enjoyable.,"The final movie is wrapped up here in a very nice form. The extended scences show somw humorous parts that were cut out (I cannot imagine why) and a bit more of Faramir's history and estranged relationship with his, er, ""special"" father. Some of the appendicies are a little boring and redundant, but the movie is just SO WONDERFULL I almost cry knowing that it's over. One alternate ending found on the appendicies (which disk it was on fails my memory) is worth a look, even though it's shown in storyboard format.An added extra are the two ""easter eggs""; one hidden on each disk. Though I won't say what they are here, they are really funny. One extended scene is quite dull (Eowyn discusses a dream to Aragorn) but that's why they make fast forward buttons. Enjoy!"
1,Horrible.,"I bought this just for a laugh, but the comedy turned into a nightmare of boredom. I feel that the movie is too long, 90 minutes would be sufficent for the whole triology. Or is this movie so ""special"" and ""unique"" that it needs several hours to tell the simple plot of some dwarfs protecting a ring?The biggest letdown is Gollum. In this movie, they have changed the costume of the actor, so that you often can see the zipper of the outfit, this is very distracting.The movie is OK for late nights when you have absolutely nothing else to do, but I have to give it a one star rating. Sorry."
2,Stop double-dipping Hollywood..,"Sure, its a great movie, but I am not going to buy it over and over again. Hollywood - stop selling the same movie over and over again! Release one version of the movie, or none at all."
1,"Oh, no!","WHY, WHY, WHY? The old LOTR version from the 70s was good enough and told the story of all three books qUite well. WHY did they all have to be redone into new movies?.... I could easily take 2 hours out of the first two because there's an unbelievable amount of boredom in them that has nothing to do with the stories! For all you big fans, go ahead and see it. And for everyone who doesn't like these movies and has friends that WORSHIP them, I'm giving you a fair warning right now: DO NOT LET THEM DRAG YOU TO THE THEATER TO SEE THIS."
1,No Extended Edition with Digital Download,"Beware this is not the Extended Edition digital download, and there are also some scenes cut from the theatrical version. You are better off buying the hard copy of this movie."
5,A cinematic masterpiece,I don't even know why I'm writing this review. If you haven't seen this film then you must have been living in a sealed room or wandering in the Himilayas for 5 years.This film is the reason they invented the word spectacular. The battle of Minas Tirith is probably one of the greatest scenes ever filmed.Anyway enough from me. I expect you already own this and if you don't you should buy from Amazon. Great price. Thanks !!
1,Bored of the Rings...get it?,"Watching all 85 hours of this extended edition made me wish--desperately wish--that Peter Jackson would make my dreams come true and finally release a version that unfolds in real time! I want to pop the DVD in my machine and have it still going for years, decades even. I want to have to quit my job so I can devote all my time to watching these hobbity goofballs dance around and fight every waking minute of every day of my life."
2,"Movie was too long. DVD holders in package break with repeated use, breaking DVD","I'll begin with my thoughts on the movie: it was too long with way too many endings. I thought the scene between Arwen and Aragorn slobbering all over each other at his coronation was cringe-worthy (I mean honestly... they did everything but dry hump). the third movie also ignored parts of the book in favor of adding scenes that appeared to be ad hoc with no other purpose than to extend the movie by a good 45 minutes.Now on to the packaging: I've watched the DVD's a few times, and some of the little round tab buttons in the package have snapped off, entombing the DVD in the case. While trying to pry out the DVD for the second half of the movie, it snapped in half! The packaging otherwise looks slick, but they could have sprung for the extra 5 cents a package to get something more durable and unbreakable than the highly-fracturable plastic they used."
5,The Lord of the Rings III,This product was excellent and just as described. Quick shipping and daughter loved her Easter present. I think she's watched it about 10 times already. Thank You.
4,great extension of Return of the King,"I have been a Tolkien fan since my college roommate told me to read his version printed in England. That was 1966. I have read the Ring Cycle to myself and my stepchildren several times over the years. I loved Peter Jackson's film adaption.The extended version and all the special production features really make this special. I ordered all three special edition versions for my 5 year old and 10 year old grandsons. This production makes it even more special. The extended versions fill in more necessary information for those who have not read the books. They also help lighten up Jackson's otherwise grim rendition, adding whimsical bits that Tolkien wrote to off set the direness."
5,Fantastic film,This is the third film in the Lord of the Rings series. All three are fantastic films! The story closely follows the classic book version with only the necessary reduction in the length to make the whole story fit into the three movies. I love the story and have read the books about 14 times. I have also seen the movies multiple times. I had to purchase a second replacement copy of this DVD because I scratched my original disc.
5,A Perfect Conclusion to a Perfect Trilogy.,"I knew from the moment I first saw the teaser trailer for the complete trilogy 3 years ago, that all 3 films were going to be absolutely stunning. I saw ""The Return of the King"" in theatres the day after its release, and I truly believe it is better than the first 2 films combined. Being it is the final chapter, all of your questions are answered in this 210 minute film. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read the books, but it is so gratifying and overwhelming to see how this story ends on film. You won't be dissapointed. They have saved the best for last."
5,the best movie I ever seen,"this movie really deserves 5 stars.It's the the Lord of the rings best movie.The actors are very good, they are the best actors of the world.The plot is very good, there was not a lot of battles and during them we don't see all details.I was a little bit disappointed with the two towers but the return of the king is amazing.We see Frodo and Sam climbing the mount doom and destruct the ring, when Aragorn the new king...The special effect are great, it's very good adaptation of the book.I highly recommend it!."
5,Nothing compares to this...,"I have seen this movie twice and was disappointed the first time I watched it...but the second time was amazing since I knew what to expect. I am from NZ and Peter Jackson's trilogy has done new zealand proud. I really enjoyed all three but the second film set the third up for success with the amazing battle scenes of helms deep etc. return of the king is something special and if Peter Jackson doesn't win a major academy award out of this, then there is something seriously wrong. Check out the Elephants and Eagles in LOTR3, they rock!!!"
4,The Last Film of a Trilogy...,"If taken in context of the difficulty of maintaining momentum for a closing chapter, Return of the King gets a close to excellent as is probably obtainable. Expectations are so high, and by now the amazement of the CGI of Gollum or the incredible cinimatography has worn off, and the fact that there must be an ending, not a cliffhanger, all conspire against the closing chapter from a ""this is great, I need to see the next one"", to ""its over, nothing more to see"". We've see it in Star Wars and the Matrix, the failure of the closing chapter to set one imagination on fire, and to some degree I think it can be said the same for Return of the King. But in comparison to SW or MR, we see a closing chapter that continues the quality of the first two installments, and although the wow factor diminishes, the quality does not."
2,Didn't like it,Not very good quality. Quit half way through. Did get it so cheap. It wasn't worth returning. The sellers service was actually very good though.
1,Product Purchased,This was disgraceful. Every disc was unplayable. I now have to purchase it again from someone else in order to be able to watch it. I am beyond disappointed and upset about this. It was a waste of money.
5,Good Job Mr Frodo,"Mindblowing. I mean seriously words cant describe how good this movie was so bare with me. First of all i have to say Peter Jackson really outdid himself with this 1 their were hardly any mistakes in ""Return"" other then the ending which i didnt understand but i wont spoil it for some of you who havent seen it yet.Basically it picks up from ""Two Towers"" where you find Frodo and Sam getting closer to Mt Doom to finally destroy the ring of power and rid middle earth of evil. Elijah and Sean do a great job in taking us with them on their journey. i felt like i was the 4th person there thats how perfect the acting was. But i strongly suggest if you havent seen the first 2 then dont watch this 1 because you wont have a clue on whats going on.so definately worth owing in any DVD library even if its not the extended version."
5,The end.,"It's an incredible movie, acting was great, the scenes were...impressive to say the least, and the movie in general was very inspiring and emotional. But...it's lost parts from the book. Plenty of them. But it's sneaky, losing a part here,a part there. You can tell though. I think Peter jackson just didnt put enough effort into making it all that it could be, because he wanted a nice sqaure number like 4 hours. But still because of the scenes he DID PUT, and they were great, this gets 5 stars."
4,Great!,"Beautiful video and audio transfers!I am disappointed with the packaging thought. Compared to the beautiful DVD digipack, this one is a total disgrace."
5,lord of the rings trilogy.,the whole hobbit/middle earth series by tolkien is excellent escape literature.the lord of the rings trilogy is both beautifully done and true to the story as written. to say anything more is guilding the lilly.
5,great Movie,"Great movie, maybe not for younger children but if your in to fantasy this is the movie for you...I would give it a 10 out of 10"
3,product good movie not so much,Ordered all 3 movies...we never watched and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The movie came quick and in great condition...but the movies were cheesy and a Harry Potter storyline rip off
4,Good but might not be necessary,"It's nice to have the extended version, but you're not missing too much if you don't have it. It mostly extends existing scenes; there's a lot of focus on Eowyn, some on Aragorn, a bit on Frodo and Sam, and a bit on Merry and Pippin."
4,Four for the third,"Final installment in the Lord of the Rings ""Trilogy"" ends as should be anticipated, the destruction of the Ring and subsequent demise of Sauron. The two unlikely heroes prevail. The bitter end is a bit ""over the top"" and it should have ended with the the completion of the book. It almost leads one to believe there is another chapter in this saga when there is none to be had. It was a bit of a down-turn to the entire saga and hence the reason for only 4 out of 5 stars. Holly-weird did it's usual thing when it took a fantastic book series and made it into a movie."
5,"Loved the book, loved the movie.","If you liked the first 2, you'll like the 3rd. I was actually surprised at the popularity of the movies. I had always considered LOTR a kind of underground movement, and thought the audience wouldn't go much past people who were already into fantasy. It's always been my favorite fantasy book and I re-read it every few years. I did think that the long ending didn't fit a movie very well, there were several points towards the end where the credits could have started rolling and it would have been OK... but it kept going.....just like this review. But I think that Peter Jackson was trying to keep true to the book as much as feasible, and appreciate all that."
4,Very well done...,"This movie was very well done, it's incredible scenes and effects make it worthy of the title. I loved how some parts of the movie sort of gave you the shivers when the stars finished speaking their words of wisdom to the troops if you know what I mean.One thing I didn't like was that the battles seemed a bit rushed. For example, in Two Towers, The Battle of Helm's Deep really seemed like a HUGE battle and it really sort of, put you there if you know what I mean. It was very well done and I loved all aspects of that battle, the preparing, the elves, the men thinking that they will not live out the night. It's all good. But in the Battle of Minas Tirith, it didn't show much of that emotion. I mean, the armies just... came... There was no real preparing no emotion shown by the troops, I mean, it's 300,000 orks!!"
5,Amazing!,"Just when I thought the other two ""Lord of the Rings"" (""LOTR"") films were the best action/adventure movies ever made I saw ""The Return of the King"" (""ROTK"") in the theatre. And while I watched it I was truly amazed in every way! ""ROTK"" closes the ""LOTR"" movie-trilogy in a wonderful way by wowing audiences and critics with great battle sequences, emotional scenes that will bring tears to your eyes, and very superb acting (which is equal to the acting in the other two ""LOTR"" movies). Each ""LOTR"" movie is phenomenal in their own way and they have a lot of fantasy, adventure, and action to offer. If you have watched and own the first and second ""LOTR"" movies on DVD, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (""FOTR"") and ""The Two Towers"" (""TTT""), then when May 25th arrives you should go out and buy the ""LOTR: ROTK"" on DVD. It is the best movie in the ""LOTR"" trilogy!"
5,Wish I could give it 10 stars,"This is my favorite film. Probably ever. It is an absolute MUST for any movie lover in general. Along with the other 2 films of course. The platinum edition is pretty damn sweet. I loved the intertwined extended/deleted scenes. I wish other directors did that more often. Yes the movie is 4 hours but for people who love movies and love great movies, it shouldnt matter how long a film is. If it was 6 hours, I would still watch it without complain. I cannot gush enough about this movie. Peter Jackson created a masterpiece that noone could possibly match. At least not anytime soon.His attention to every detail is evident in this movie. The acting is wonderful, I even stopped cringing at Elijah Wood's acting after this film. And I absolutely adore the score to this. I own the soundtrack to all 3 films. I love them all. I dont own many other soundtracks but this is a must for anyone. I could go on and on."
5,The Complete Experience,"I think this is the best of the three extended editions. The additional content is amazing and very touching some times. And if you're wondering if it includes spanish subtitles, it's true, and not only the movie, but all the additional content too. A must have for all the real LOTR movies' fans."
5,LOTR FINALE!!!,"This movie is gonna rock!!I'm so confident is this movie being as good, or even BETTER than the first two, I am writing a review two months before it comes out...Knowing the story, it won't be easy for them to put everything perfectly onto the screen, but I have the utmost confidence they will...LOTR is the greatest trilogy ever written!"
2,Excellent,This DVD must be on every Lord of the Rings' fan collection. The extra features are excellent.
2,hollywoodized,"I'm sorry, but all the hype, all the denial won't help in years to come with the third insallment. IT WAS BORING. the EE is better than the theatrical release and that is why I'm giving it two stars. i would like to give it 2 and a half but can't. I LOVE THE FIRST MOVIE. the EE is near flawless film making. So how can you go from that to this silly, overly self-important, deliberately manipulative story telling. WHA' HAPPENED? I'll tell you what. the director got caught up in his own hype. Christopher Lee had every right to be annoyed and at least this version fixes that. the story is more fleshed out, as it is with all three EE's, but it still doesn't fix the fundamental floors of a film with far too many endings, a magic user who does barely anything magical, and characters that have been given the hollywood treatment (the rot started with the 2nd flick). once the new smell wears off this one many will see it for what it really is: overly long and boring."
1,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!,This Movie Is horable!!!!!!! The movie itself was OK but when you compare it with the books IT SUCKED!!!!! I hate the movies aparently mr. jakson is as shallow as it gets if he thinks he can re-write tolkien's master peice!a 13 year old veiwer
1,I WATCH THIS WHEN I CANT FALL ASLEEP,"NOPE, I JUST DONT SEE HOW PEOPLE LOVE THIS MOVIE. BUT I TELL YOU THIS THE THE HOLLYWOOD MEDIA FAVORS THIS MOVIE ALOT, AND SO DO THE PEOPLE FOLLOW.WELL PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT I GUESS.BUT I WALKED OUT OF THE THEATERS ON THIS ONE. WENT TO WATCH A BETTER MOVIE.GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS THOUGH."
1,One star is too many in my opinion!,"A word of advice to those of you who have been waiting for the extended release, hoping it would clear up some of the missing information. Know how sadly dissapointed you may be. I was able to watch a rip of the extended version and I'm glad I did before I ordered it! Unlike the first two where the extended version added some much needed scenes to fill gaps in the story, this version adds things that never even happened. In a degree that was shocking and upsetting to me even thought I would not consider my self a Tolkein Purist. I would have rather not had an extended version and I am sorry but the Scouring of the Shire was a damn important part! I was okay with it not being in there but instead we get some made up crap, that never happened to Sauraman. I will be ordering the theatrical release of this movie, at least it is not as far from the book as this version. If I want the real story I will just pull out my books for a re-read!"
3,Not bad if you ddin't read the books....,"This movie is entertaining, but there are a lot of differences between the movie and the book. If you really loved the books, as I did, you might have some trouble with the changes that Peter Jackson made."
5,Mr Moneybags is sure a funny fellow,"People, it is painfully obvious that moneybags was trying to be sarcastic, and you did exactly what he wanted you to do: reply like raving fanboys.Anyway, Return of the King is the most spectatular film to grace a theater. It is filled with awe, violence, and provides great entertainment! Not once was I bored- if you are patient I would suggest passing on this DVD and waiting for the Extended Version to come out- 40 more minutes are promised"
5,AMAZING!,"This was a perfect conclusion to the trilogy. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes to the battle sequences are spectacular. The bonfire-signal sequence was beautiful, and one of my favorite movie moments ever."
5,the lord of the rings is the best thing i have ever saw,The first time i saw the lord of the rings the fellow ship of the ring i didn't think it was that good because i didn't no there was going to be two more moives coming then when i saw that the lord of the rings the two towers were coming out i watched the fellow ship of the ring again and i started to like it. the next week win the two towers came to the drivin i went to see it and it was the best now i am crazy about the lord of the rings and win i saw this web site i was looking thouht it i saw a lot of things that you can get like the swords and axes and helm and bows and the one ring that i want a lot and i can't wait till the lord of the rings the return of the king comes out.
2,What's The Big Deal?,"I've seen better movies than this. I mean, it's 1) extremely long. I almost fell asleep. 2) Mostly fighting. Come on! It's not all fighting. What a disappointment. It should have won special effects and that's it. This movie sucks. Big time."
3,Three endings too many!,"This wasn't as good as part 2, but it was definitely better than the first film. The only problem I had with it was the ending(s). Seriously, how many endings could a film have? Peter Jackson just didn't know when to let go. You think the film is over, but it goes on for another 20 minutes. That's never good. Overall, pretty good though, but undeserving of all those Oscars."
2,"Nice effects, but unfortunately I read the book...","There's just too much in the book to capture on the screen. If Jackson really wanted to get it all in, the film would probably be about 7 hours long, at least. The beginning starts out great, and the battle scenes are spectacular, but I just get lost watching it during the last hour or so... There are several climax points in the book, and for anyone who wanted to get this right, they really needed to spend more time with each individual character climax, instead of an overall climax. Many partings became too many partings. Vigo Mortensen hums a short verse to something Jackson threw together 5 minutes before production. It really needed more time in the oven... PREMATURE."
1,They are really Milking it,"They did this with the DVD release with the various versions (theatrical, extended, and the limited edition) now they are starting down the same road with Blu-ray version. This is just not right."
3,Could have been better if I had not read the book,"Mr. Jackson takes entirely too many liberties with the third book. He changed the characters too much. He portrays Gandalf too weak, and Aragon to strong. The confrontation between Galdalf and the Witch King is horrible.If you are someone watching this with out first reading the book, it would be excelent, but once you read the books, this movie is too different.The movie is grand, too grand. It almost seems that Jackson sold out to hollywood in this movie."
1,"ok, the climax.... more of the same",nothing stood out. whatever.greatest movie of all time it is not.
5,Must-have for the collector.,"Anyone serious about their movie library or just a fan of LOTR will want this. This is the version with additional footage inserted, it comes with 2 discs of behind the scenes footage and a micro-miniature of Minas Tirith. Your average movie fan may be satisfied with the standard edition, but this is a must for the collector."
5,A fantastic world,"Peter Jacksons epos is not only worth looking, its worth looking again and again. Return of the king is the final of a big journey into imagination. The only point I dont like is that certainly my own fantasies about middleearth would be with much less violence, so I would prefer to life in this world but in the peaceful time that will come after Return of the King. But finally, how could someone make a 9 hour movie in three parts about a peaceful time? Lord of the Rings has a lot scenes of war and violence, but its surrounded of wonderful characters and fantastic environment, thanks to J.R.R Tolkien."
5,Best Movie Ever,"This movie is the epic ending to the Lord of the Rings trilogy and it action packed beginning to end. I was biting my nails throughout the movie. It is a thrill-ride and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I recommend this for anyone who has a DVD library. The whole trilogy itself is a masterpiece, and will be remembered for ages to come. J.R.R. Tolkien is staring down fondly on Peter Jackson and winning 11 Oscars. It swept the Academy Awards, winning everything it was nominated for. What a great film."
5,Hail King Elessar!,"I was absolutely smitten by the release of this last installment. I eagerly await the release of the extended series, being a Tolkien fan, a lot of stories were left out.. such as The Halls of Healing. The only down side to this is the ending, too long.. just too long."
2,Movie would be great but if it cannot finish playing....,"I have this particular movie, yet about midway through, it locks up and will not play the rest of the movie. Different DVDs players, etc. Nothing makes a difference. One day I will learn the ending sequences that I am unable to view on these discs."
5,oooh yeahhh,"this was the best of all three. The battles, the acting, the new characters, the interaction between the characters, etc. I really appreciate Sam in this one--there's a lot of ""Go Sam!"" moments--and Aragorn. But of course, Aragorn is the best character in all three. Set him loose with Anduril, and he'll wipe out all Mordor. Or Isengard. Legolas? Forget him. He stinks.Yeah, the DVD extra features were disappointing--I think I've gotten too used to the super-in-depth Extended Version features. Haha. Yes, person from Rio de Janeiro, there will be an Extended Version which, according to various Internet sources, will feature the scene with Eowyn and Faramir. (And there was much rejoicing)"
5,My 2nd favorite,"I love this movie. It's got even more action than the 1st and 2nd combined!!!! The only downside is there are so many lose-ends for Peter Jackson to tie up, the ending wasn't satisfying for me. Tying up all the lose ends for various characters just had a ""rushed"" feel to it. I'm not as impressed with the editing here. So the 2nd movie remains my favorite."
5,Another rebuttal to Mr. Money-bags,"Although with the number of reviews already posted, the chance that anyone will read this is slight, I HAD to write a response to the review posted by Mr. Money-bags, specifically his comments about how the LOTR movies were rip-offs from Star Wars. Perhaps he should check the original copy-write date on the LOTR books (you did know that there was a trilogy of books written first, didn't you?) If anything, George Lucas ripped the Star Wars mythos off from the LOTR books. (This is not a knock at Star Wars, which I also loved.)Despite the fact that there was no way to be 100% true to the books without the movies being roughly 17 hours longer apiece (which even fanatical fans would probably say is too long,) the story line was carried through remarkably well, and the cinematography created a picture of Middle Earth that seemed to be what Tolkein was writing about in the first place."
5,Simply amazing.,"This movie is the most stunningly beautiful film I have ever seen. I simply cannot get over how much love, care, painstaking detail for the costumes and sets went into making this movie what it is.What truly tugged at my heart strings was the amazing acting by Sean Astin during the part when Sam must pick the exhausted Frodo up and carries him all the way up the mountain and in the end where all four of the hobbits stand together as the newly crowned king and all of the wedding guests bow down before them.All of the emotions that make life worth living are all present in this spectacular film and I'm so very glad I've been lucky enough to see it on the big screen. Waiting to buy it on DVD has been painful but this movie is worth the wait!"
2,Broken,The dvd was not new but yoused! Also whas the dvd holder broken at some places. A good thing was that it was earlier then expected.
2,Reception not good,The movie is great but the streaming was not - it would stop and buffer every 1/2 hour and change back and forth between HD and regular Tv.
3,LOTR a classic,"Well great it is in good shape, no scratches and like new, the only thing is that it says full screen and it is wide screen, but anyway it is a great item."
5,greatest movies ever,"""The Return of the King"" is the greatest movie ever made, even better than ""Citizen Kane"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"". The casting is perfect, the visual effects are above and beyond perfection, and there is only one bad thing about these movies: Tolkien wasn't alive to see them. He would be immensely pleased.Now, everyone knows that Peter Jackson is remaking ""King Kong"". But after that he will be making ""The Hobbit""!!!!! I can't believe there are people saying that Elijah Wood should play Bilbo. Never!!!!! Elijah Wood is Frodo. Ian Holm is Bilbo. No one can out-do Ian Holm's performance. In the first movie, I almost started crying when he first came on screen, it was so perfect! Elijah Wood even said he won't be doing ""The Hobbit"". These are the actors I hope they bring back for ""The Hobbit"":IAN HOLM as BilboIAN McKELLEN as GandalfJOHN RHYS-DAVIES as Thorin and BeornHUGO WEAVING as ElrondANDY SERKIS as Gollum"
5,LotR Platinum Series Spec. Ext. Edition,Loved every minute of this set. Especially the off camera scenes. They were outstanding.
4,Near great,"Pros-Saruman and Gandalf scene at beginning was excellent and worth the price alone.The Mouth of Sauron was interesting and I highly anticipated this scene, but, as said in the extras, it is impossible to duplicate the tension of the book in this scene because in the book you don't know what has happened to Frodo yet.The earthquake of skulls in the Paths of the Dead was stunning (but possibly slightly over the top when they envelope the trio).Surprisingly, no extra endings.Cons -It seems to me that some of the sequences of battle scenes were changed. The battle doesn't flow as well, especially at the end when it is drawn out so that Gothmog is fighting Eowyn and then Aragorn walks by and kills him. Somewhat anticlimactic for Eowyn to fight Gothmog after she killed the Witch King, but I am nitpicking."
2,in Wyoming,I got tired of all the battle scenes. I was waiting all through the picture for it to end as I became more and more restless. The first movie was the only one that actually carried some story line and I enjoyed it. The second and the third I found tiring because most of them seemed to be battles.
5,Excellent,Everything went fine and goods were delivered over a week earlier than expected.Thank-you and I will use your services again.
3,It's toooooo Long,"This thing is about 25 minutes toooo long. The ending just drags on forever. It could have stopped at the wedding scene. There are parts in the middle that need to be cut, they add nothing to the story and seem to be just left in as filler. I saw it twice, didn't really like it 100% the first time and truly disliked it the second time. The CG and other special effects are too obvious, and at times I felt like the story was just meandering all over the place. When you compare it against the first movie it defects just glare at you."
2,Don't buy this for the Minas Tirith sculpture,"Go buy the regular extended edition right now. The scultpture of Minas Tirith has two parts, with the top part being a cover for a velvet lined storage compartment in the lower part. Sounds nice? Think again. The base is too big, extending beyond the 'lid' and exposing an unnaturally flat crescent area that can not be overlooked. Plus it's so tightly packaged that it was easily to snap off an little piece of the sculpture as I attempted to extract it."
1,WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i cannot beleave that this movie won so many awards! past the five endings, the same freaking battle scenes, and some elephents in england, new zealand or where ever it takes place in the world, it was still horrible. ( by the way lotr freaks there is no middle earth ) we find frodo the wimp on the way to the volcano with his wimpy friend sam and their psycopathic sidekick gollum. we also find aragorn ( HATE HIM ) and the only ok characters legolas and gimly. we then go into the stupid never ending battles where legolas jumps on a elephant and kills it. these battles seemed all the same: chaos, untrained or prepared soldiers, the fact that the fab three cant be killed after 10 battles where they are outnumbered 1000-1. im running out of time so let me say this: how the hell does a 4 hour movie win best editing?"
3,Haven't Seen It But...,"In the sneek preview of THE RETURN OF THE KING on THE TWO TOWERS DVD there are shots of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli walking through the Path of the Dead, a scene which was not in the old cartoon. I don't know why LotR fans worship that cartoon. It's a tough film to watch. I know it's from the 70s and paceing of movies was diffrent then but christ! These films are a lot (LOT) better."
1,What a sh*t,"The movie itself is boring and the CGI effects - especially Gollum - are absolutly bad done. It is only a mainstreameffect, which made the movie so popular..."
2,GRRRRRR! Lord of the Waiting!,"I love this movie! I HATE this DVD! Wait for the deluxe verison this fall. Evil Peter Jackson, torture his poor fans like this with this...this trivial DVD!"
5,Incredible. But Mildly Problematic,"There are many reviews about the extraordinary qualities of these three movies, with Return being the climactic high point in both a narrative sense and a cinematic sense as well. I havent felt this attatched to characters in a long time and realize that this trilogy has raised the bar in so many ways. My one fault (who cares if it doesnt follow the book completely-it got a million people reading the books! Actually reading!) is that there are some racial steriotypes hanging around...like the asians in their closely resembling junks and the orc hybrids looking extremely African American...I understand that there needs to be a basis for every character, but making all humans and elfs in the movie aryan was just a tad annoying. Superficial, yes to a degree, but this is a movie that will live on, and I hope that that doesnt date it. In any case a must see film."
1,Does the blueray actually have the extended version? Deceptive advertising?,"The product page http://www.amazon.com/The-Lord-Rings-Return-Blu-ray/dp/B003TT2X6S/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_topThis says that both theatrical and extended versions are on one disk. Only one version is visible and that looks like the theatrical release.Is it too much to ask Amazon to get its facts straight?There is no provision on the contact information to complain about such matters.EDIT: I now see that others have realized the same thing and that this is not the extended version, despite what Amazon's web page says.I am trying to initiate a return of the dvd but Amazon will not let me select a reason for returning and thus it is impossible for me to return an item that Amazon has sold to me under false pretenses.AMAZON PLEASE AMEND THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND LET ME RETURN THIS DISK."
3,"5 Stars for the film, 3 Stars for the DVD","The film itself is excellent. There are plenty of reviews to read about the film itself.I found this version of the DVD disappointing. There is absolutely nothing special about the Special Features. Three mini documentaries are offered, each showing almost identical footage and interviews. Otherwise, the viewer gets to see trailers and tv spots (does anyone actually find watching those ads to be entertaining?). There are a few other forgettable featurettes. Compared to the first two DVDs in this series, this one doesn't offer much.Buy this for the film itself. Just don't expect more than that."
4,"Good movie, but weak on the special features","I didn't see this one in the theatre, so I can't compare the transfer quality, but if (like me) you've seen Parts 1 and 2, you have to see Part 3.The second disc begins with two ""documentaries."" The second (longer) one contains almost all of the footage from the first one! And no feature commentary(ies). If you're a devotee with the extra funds and don't need to see this film right now, you probably should wait for the 4-disc extended edition that will be out by the end of the year."
5,"Watching At Home, A Great Experience....","Not much can be said about how great this movie is that hasn't been written already. This review is geared toward the purchase of the dvd. When is saw this at the theatre, my senses of sight & hearing were overwhelmed.One a huge screen, there is so much action to swallow it's nearly impossible to digest it all. Those screeching flying Nazgul dinosaurs, ouchhhh! While watching it for the first time at home, I saw things I don't remember from my theatre experience. The small screen actually shows the eye things from a different perspective. You are able to take in the entire screen at once. I am not going to say it's like watching a different movie, but the same movie with subtle differences. Many people might be reluctant to buy the dvd after seeing the movie on the big screen, don't be! You'll enjoy the movie over again and again. Add to cart!"
2,"Films were great, however...","As the title says, the films were absolutely phenomenal. I would recommend everyone take the time to watch them. Though, I would also recommend that they watch it somewhere other than Amazon. I just ran a speed test, and I'm getting 15mb down, and 3mb up, and yet this film was only streamed to me at 480p. Not only that, but it lagged horribly halfway through the film, and stopped working completely twenty minutes before the actual end of the movie. I can honestly say that for once in my life, Amazon, you have failed me."
5,beautiful,"I am in love with anything Tolkien. This box set is beautiful, I'm stoked that I will have it forever!! umm the title says The Return of the King, but I bought the whole boxed trilogy set aka The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. Excellent!"
3,extended movies are boring,"I should learn by now. The scenes edited out were done by people smarter than me and -no offense- than most of the reviewers here.I am a fan, but I guess not enough of a diehard to praise the House of Healing scenes. I did look forward to all, but the House scenes were short segments of actor and the actress looking at each other. Not much dialogue. In my opinion, a failure compared to what was expressed in the novel. Same goes for other extended scenes.I need the LTR 2, but I am not going to get extended movie for any extra price.edit : Got a chance to see Two Towers, extended. Added scenes blend and contribute to the whole movie better than the Return of the King. Worth paying for? IDK. LOL."
5,Lord of the Rings (The Return of the King),Hey you all. I must Start out on saying that this movie is great no question asked. I enjoy it every single time i get the chance to watch it.Regards.
5,Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,Received the DVD right away and in great condition. Love the movie and had it already but wanted the full screen edition. If you haven't seen any of the Lord of the Rings DVD I recommend them highly!
3,the third but not the best in the series,"Well LOTR trilogy is pretty good and I have the other two and was missing this one. The story is good as well as most of the action sequences but this one tends to go on and on and the final battle at the black gate of Murdor is a bit anti climatic after all we have seen in the previous films. An example in this film is Frodo's scenes with the spider which seemed to just go on and on taking away from the battle of Gondor. Anyway thats my two cents if your a fan you've got to get all three films, however for my money the Two Towers is by far the best film out of the three."
3,Picture is deceiving,"The product pictured is the DVD extended version. The actual product is the VHS version. I know the ""VHS"" part is in parentheses at the end of the description, but the seller should change the picture to one of the actual product."
2,Audio too low; needs subtitles,"Great convenience and extended rental time but the audio level is low. I had to turn volume all the way up and there scenes that were still really hard to hear. Also, subtitles would help a lot!"
5,Fantastic Climax,"The Return of the Rings is the brilliant climax to the film version of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is powerful with great filming, characterization, and special effects. The acting was great with the friendship between Frodo and Sam being especially powerful, an accurate reflection of the book. It is hard to imagine finer casting possible for the roles. In many cases films are not nearly as good as the book, but this is different. It stays close enough to the original that it complements the book. I hope to watch it with my daughter when she is more mature after we read the series."
5,Return OF The KING,"Return of the king rocks,it is 6the best movie ever.Aragorn is bearing the fate of hope,Frodo is concearned with fear,and the fellowship is broken.This is a must see movie."
5,Every Emotion Possible!!!!!!,"I've already seen ROTK 3 times in 4 days. Each time I watch it; I begin to realize more and more that this is the end of the Trilogy but now a new road is forming and I shall take another path. This Trilogy will always be a part of my life until the day that I die. I've cried, laughed and felt every emotion that a person could possibly feel. I don't want it to end but we must all move on, yet it's scary thinking that we will never get to see Frodo and Sam again or to hear Merry and Pippin sing. I think that for everyone who has followed the story from day one we have all changed and will never be the same. Thank you Peter Jackson, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving and the rest of the Cast. These 4 have stolen my very heart and I have changed because of you.Kathy"
2,Disappointing Conclusion to the Series,"I could accept the minor changes in the previous movies to exaggerate the importance of Arwen. But in ""Return of the King,"" Gandalf's role because laughable. He is riddled with doubt and insecurity - the director claims this was necessary to bring out the importance of Aragorn's role - but then, Aragorn's role wasn't developed all that well, either.The sappiness of Arwen fading, nearing death, with her survival linked to the defeat of Sauron... It's like they're trying the ""I do believe in fairies (clap, clap, clap)"" ploy from Peter Pan to emotionally involve you. It just doesn't belong in the movie.""The Lord of the Rings"" books were a strong enough series, and the characters were so well developed that you feel you know them. The first two movies of the series were very true to the books. They should have kept this same strategy for the final movie, and left the characters as Mr. Tolkien intended them to be."
1,Don't Forget about the EXTENDED VERSION Coming SOON!,"This is the same OLD THEATRICAL EDITION ONLY NONSENSE. GIVE US SEAMLESS BRANCHING WITH EXTENDED EDITION TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY! They have the technology for many years now to use seamless branching to release THEATRICAL AND EXTENDED CUTS of these movies to make everyone happy. To release only the theatrical cuts is just pathetic milking attempt. I purchased the extended versions on DVD and will not purchase any Lord of the RINGS BLU RAY until teh EXTENDED VERSIONS are available. SEAMLESS BRANCHING WAS INVENTED MANY YEARS AGO, YOUR A BUNCH OF IDIOTS and COMMUNITY COLLEGE DROPOUT MARKETING DEPARTMENT. Go eat seome TACO BELL and McDonald's while your at it!"
3,Great Movie-Pointless DVD release (for most fans),"The three stars is for the DVD, not the film.Theres no point in even reviewing this film, its an above average beautifully crafted piece of cinema that concludes one of the greatest stories of all time. But THIS dvd release? The sound and picture quality are about as good as can get, but the extra features are pretty useless. Infact the first two documentaries ""The Quest Fulfilled: A Director's Vision"" and ""A Filmmaker's Journey: Making The Return of The King"" use so many of the same images and snipets of interviews that they are almost identicle. They even have the same basic structure.It all depends on how much your into the trilogy, if you enjoyed the movie and want to own it, theres nothing wrong with this release, if your LOVED the trilogy then rent this one, watch the feature and the extras and wait for the extended edition, that will be the version worth owning."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"Well this is what everyone was waiting for. The last LOTR special extended edition dvd set, but if your like me I'm just going to buy the Complete Trilogy Extended Editon Set with all 3 movies in the extended 4 disc version for like $70. Thats wierd because the regular theatrical version set was $80 when it came out.This is definately worth $25 though if you have the other two. Your getting a whole lotta time out of this. A special extended version of the movie which is cool, 4 commentaries which are great to listen to over and over again, and a whole truckload of other great sepcial features that will let you know more about the movie."
4,I have a question?,"Why isn't there a version in which you can buy just the 3rd movie and the box from the boxset? Anime companies do this all the time. Also, the Jurassic Park series had an offer in which you could mail away for the box for the set for $5 if you bought the third movie. I really hope that new line cinema does the same thing."
1,so sick of these stupid movies,"I don't know why everyone loves these movies. They are a bunch of stupid gothic ghosts and goblins. It's the oldest premise for a movie ever. I hate these movies. They are so overrated, it boggles the mind. I'd rather have both my arms ripped off and beat with them unmercifully than have to watch another one of these movies."
1,God I love 17 hour long movies,I haven't read these books. Sorry to disappoint. Orcs with downs syndrome and overacting hobbits that should still be starring in the movie of the week don't entice me eitherBloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated Bloated OVERACTED
3,let's just wait and see......,"Having been sorely disappointed with the third film (how can you call this a success when there isn't a trace of Saruman and Wormtongue, when so much time is spent on the affectionate longing amid the lava floes, when no time is given to how war changes the combatants, when the real ending is altered so drastically to fit Jackson's preconceptions?), I have only a fool's hope that this extended version will adress a few of the omissions that made the book such a profound story. Profundity is not the province of cgi geeks, though, is it?"
3,Decent but long!,"This movie just runs too long. The dialogue is stiff enough to bore you and the overall feel of the movie is pretty much cliche'. The FX are excellent however and the movie is, in it's own right, a masterpiece. Overall: DECENT."
3,Good but could be better,"While the third installment isn't as good as the first movie in the trilogy, it is much better than the horrible 2nd movie. In several instances the movie deviated from the book to make the story more complicated, harder to film, and less dramatic than the book. Typical Hollywood messing around to make a great story mediocre."
5,Simply Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!,"Anything I say couldn't do this movie justice. LOTR is simply the BEST movie trilogy I've seen, and this one's a great conclusion to it."
2,Style over content,"ROTK is a visual masterpiece, technically brilliant, and a very poor telling of Tolkien's masterpiece.Once again Peter Jackson amazes audiences with breathtaking special effects and stunning scenery. He also repeats his formula for the preceding two films, that of including only those parts of the story that he either feels he cannot get away with ditching, or that will provide him with the excuse for his visual triumphs.Jackson's version of Tolkien's story is a wonderful film, but anyone who wanted to know what all the fuss was about would come away from this disappointed. It would be fair to say that LOTR has not been filmed at all."
3,too long!!!!,i like the lord of the rings movies so dont hate me when i say this is the most boring ring movie. its not a bad script or anything but its damn long.its a great flick in all ways just needs to be cut about 45mins
1,Justice !!,When are the HILDEBRANDT BROTHERS going to get the proper acknowledgement by the makers of this film concerning their influence on the TOTAL look of this and the other films by Peter Jackson ?!!!??
5,The Best DVD Ever,This film deserved all 11 Oscars and one more for Sean Astin's brilliant acting done in this film. I have never seen such a film as exciting or moving as this. Surely it will become one of the best films of all time period.
2,Extend THIS,"Editors have their jobs for a reason: Cutting the crap and getting to the point. Extended scenes were cut because they have no effect upon the film and in fact slow the pacing. I do not need to see the film's excess especially when that excess betrays the storyline. I did not need to see Saruman killed by Wormtongue and then fall fifty stories - this did not happen in the book. I did not need to see Sam confront Gollum, because he had done it many times already during the regular film. I did not need to see the Witch King confront Gandalf at Minas Tirith. I did not need to see the bizarre speaker for Sauron at the Black Gate. These added scenes confuse the viewer and soil Tolkien's work. These added scenes add another half hour onto an already long film. Enough is enough. Let's return Jackson's film back to its leaner, meaner, pristine condition."
4,Plight of The Hobbits,"The whole story for me begins and ends with the metamorphasis of the hobbits. That being said, how does Peter Jackson decide to leave out the scene where the hobbits return to the shire and have to defeat Sauraman and Wormtail. I thought that was a huge mistake when I heard they were leaving that part out of the trilogy. Other than that it was a good transformation into a long trilogy."
1,I'm not into kid's movies,"It's definitely nothing more than a really long, expensive kid's movie. How can you tell for sure? The good guys are good because... um... they just are really really good. The bad guys are bad because, well, uh... they just are. For some reason. Of course, in real life, war is never that simple. Humans are all good and evil, every one. Sure, some are worse than others, but do you really believe that on any battlefield ever, all of the characters on one side were uniformly evil while those opposing them were unfailingly pure of heart? Of course not. The characters are two-dimensional, cartoonish parodies of someone's dungeons and dragons fantasy. You can tell a grown up movie when you see one, becuase it wil be populted with actual people. Note the replies to this review; I predict that they will say I'm wrong because... well... I just am. For some reason."
2,The worst of the series,"This film did not deserve the ""Best Picture"" oscar and was by far the weakest of the three films. The ending was horrible and all I can say is get a better editor. The ghost scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean were far superior to the ones in this film. By the end of the film you wish Frodo could have fallen to his death along with Gollum. He tried to do too much in this film and the true trophy of this entire series was by far The Two Towers."
5,AMAZING!!!,"Not a lot of people agreed with me when I said I felt the second part was better than the first, but I think all my friends agreed that the third was the best. This trilogy is absolutely amazing and is the best I have seen in .. well .. than I have ever seen. The scenery is breathtaking and the action scenes leave me in awe. I have the 1st and 2nd installment extended sets and cannot wait for this one. I am looking forward to getting all my friends together and watching all 3 extended versions back to back. It helps to watch them on a large flat screen television .. I think we will need to get surround sound as well to enhance the experience."
3,Full Screen version of ROTK not yet available,"There have been some comments about multiple versions of the DVDs being released, the theatrical version followed by the extended edition, etc. Have fans who are ordering this extended version noticed that it is available so far in 'widescreen' only, and not in full screen?I have tried without success to contact Amazon customer service to find out when the full screen version will be available."
1,"Without special effects, this is nothing","The acting is simply laughable. The set design is quite amateurish. The computer-generated special effects are simply silly and unconvincing. Plus, this is almost four hours of utter ennui. People seem to enjoy this only because other people seem to enjoy this. To give this an Oscar once again shows that Hollywood is a total self-flattering piece of joke."
1,Awful waste of 4 hrs,"A complete waste of money, time, and some hours of extremely unpleasant after taste. A horrendous experience.Wonder why in the space age, people are still fascinated by epic wars, honor in death, and glory in victory achieved by endless bloodshed.I have no idea who gave this movie so many oscars - fixed, I am sure."
1,opium for the masses,"The true Lord Of The Rings is a book.This is a CGI driven marketing tool.If you really must watch tv, watch the original Solaris."
1,Return of the King,"Allright, to begin I would like to make clear that there IS an existing ""Return of the King"" on VHS, but it is certainly not by Peter Jackson. It is a cartoon version and is, beyond ANY doubt, the WORST movie I have EVER seen. So please, do not blame poor Peter Jackson for the mess up. Now, if you enjoy listening to terrible ballads about ""Frodo of the nine fingers, and the ring of doom"", and the thought of a studdering hideous Sam, who uses his entire hand to cover his nose, is funny, than I highly recommend it. On the other hand, if you want to see a movie that even REMOTELY resembles what Professor Tolkien wrote, than PLEASE FOR YOUR OWN SAKE wait until Peter Jackson's version comes out in December (which will bypass pretty much EVERYONE'S expectations, I'm sure of it)."
3,The entire series is overrated!,"They were entertaining, but nothing special. I expected to see a movie that had at the least visually stunning effects. Which this one did not. Hopefully not too many people actually purchase this movie."
5,The best of the three...,"This is the first Lord of the Rings movie that I have seen without reading the book. Perhaps that has colored my perceptions, but I believe this to be the best of the three. It comes on strong and doesn't let up for most of the movie. There is one spectacular battle scene after another.There are plenty of small touches I like as well. I enjoyed the prologue which gives us a more detailed account of Gollum's back-story. I LOVED the giant spider that Frodo faces. I also like the way the movie takes the time to show us what happens to our heroes afterwards. It asks the question; Just what does one do with oneself once the adventure is over?I would have liked to have seen Christopher Lee in it, but I guess I'll have to wait for the DVD."
4,Warning !,I purchase this edition because of the english dts. I'm french and I saw that this edition has a french subtitle. I just receive my package and there is no french subtitle. It will be great if you can remove this fault from your technical review of this edition.The film is great and the extended version is more attractive than in theaters.Enjoy !
4,LONG BUT WELL WORTH IT!!!,"There are few movies out there that last in excess of 3 hours and are able to maintain a viewers attention. Fortunately, this is one of them. This movie was non-stop action, suspense and thrills from start to finish...a must see for all LOTR followers and non-followers alike.If there was a down-side, this is not a movie that you can view without first having seen the previous two. There are so many subplots and storylines happening at the same time that you would be lost. However, all three are well worth the time and effort so go for it.LONG LIVE THE LORD OF THE RINGS!!!"
5,I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!,"I'm going to see it tonight and I CAN""T WAIT WHATSOEVER! I heard magnificent things about this movie, and I've been a loyal fan, just like you people probably have. Only...4 1/2 more hours! WHOOT WHOOT! ::sigh:: Why did I have to get tickets for the 7 o'clock one? But, I'm sure you people don't really care about that, eh? OKAY, back to the movie. My mom is having a bet against my dad that Frodo dies. I'm not sure, but I think Gimli dies/ gets seriously hurt. I don't know. Who cares. He's cool, but can't ya just hear him saying in his deep, rusky voice, ""No, go on wit' out meh."" I can."
2,Boring,"I'm probably the only person who has written a negative review of this movie. I enjoyed the first installment as I found it entertaining, well paced and visually stunning. I found this movie to be unbearably boring. I actually had to fast-forward through parts of it, it was so slow. I sometimes wonder if people fall into the trap of thinking this is a brilliant movie because of the PR behind it. Oscar? I must be really missing something here.It was a few big boring fight scenes strung together with slow dialogue, weak plot lines and great visuals. I can only watch a sword battle so many times - they really aren't all that many variations.Next time I'll try to drink the cool aid if they have another installment to increase my viewing pleasure."
4,"Good Movie, great effects, but please end the movie","This was my favorite of the three movies. The first was horrifically boring and I almost avoided any of the others because of it. Thankfully, i tried out two towers and it brought back my faith that these could be good movies. My only knock on this movie was-for the love of God, cut the last 30 minutes. It was like a relative who stays too long at a Christmas party-sure you were happy to see them earlier in the night, but now its late and its time for them to go. The last 30 minutes offered nothing except a complete waste of my time. So by averaging out the 5 stars the movie had in the first 3/4ths of the film with the 1 star for the last 30 minutes, i get a 4 star rating. I am still baffled by how this movie won best picture of the year though."
2,Yawn.,"I'm glad I didn't spend the $ and 201 minutes of my life to see this painfully ponderous tome in the theatre. As it is, I resent the rental fee but I asked for it. This could have been good at a two hour running time. Do the film makers think we have bladders of iron? It is troubling that Frodo's journal has blank pages for Sam to fill; please no mas!"
3,Interesting,"I am not a big fan of fantasy genre movies or tv shows, but when the first and second LOTR movies came out I was stunned by the brilliance of the people in front of and behind the camera. The same mostly goes for this last installments, but it also just seems to maudlin - there are probably 5 different endings to the movies and it just drags on. I certainly respect the director and his crew for putting so much effort into making the books come to life, such an epic movie on such a grand scale has not been tried in recent memory with such aplomb, but I feel unlike those grand pictures of before, LOTR goes more for show and special effects to make its impact rather than dialogue and simplicity. Lawrence of Arabia was an epic film, yet it had so many great lines and the acting was magnificent. The Last Emperor and Gandhi, big sweeping films with wonderful visuals, were just as great too. Unfortunately, LOTR can never compare to these grand films of yesteryear."
5,The best reveiw for the best movie.,"this movie was by far the best action movie in the history of action movies . It was probably the best movie I'v seen. I can see now why it won 11 oscars including best picture. I thought Sean Austin was brilliant in this movie. Elijah Wood was also pretty good and we can't forget how good Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen were. The action was AMAZING.The visual effects were top notch in this movie. This movie deserved a round of applause because of so many extras ,so much make for all those extras,and all those costumes for all those extras. I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Congratsulations Peter Jackson job well done."
5,Simply Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You should have already seen this motion picture and the last two before it. If you haven't see them all then what are you waiting for? You would have to be locked in a room for a long, long time to not know about it.It is recommended you start with the first picture, ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" and move on to the second picture, ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" then see this one. This can be a stand alone picture but it was not intended to be that. You really must view all 3 pictures; the trilogy is a ""MUST SEE.""It is masterful work and superb acting and action all the way around."
5,Great!,"I had to replace a lost DVD for a friend and was worried that it would cost me a lot. I found this, fantastic price for the item. Item was exactly as described. The item was promptly shipped to me."
1,Buyer Beware,"This chair ships with the NO COVER for the seat. What you get is a bare seat (foam and wood).First time I thought it was a mistake, and AMAZON shipped out a new one. Same issue.The factory is telling me that it's working with AMAZON to figure this out...A week later, and I still have the chair that can't be used, no word from the factory, and AMAZON keeps thanking me for my patience.Stay away from this one for sure! (Based on the factory response, I'd stay away from any chairs they make)"
3,Destination Docklands,"Destination Docklands is an uneven live album that contains some great tracks like Industrial Revolution, Magnetic Fields 2, Oxygene 4 , 4th Rendez-Vous and 2nd Rendez-Vous. However, the decision to include tracks such as London Kid, September and The Emigrant lowers the grade alot. The booklet has a cheap looking cover but we get an extensive list of the Musicians and The Team that aided the concert. 3/5."
4,"Bigger than I thought, but a good buy!","While the Bungee case is a little bit bigger than I was anticipating (which is my fault, since I didn't really think about the dimensions written and just went by the picture), it is sturdy, easy to use, and extremely convenient. Just make sure if you are expecting something that is actually roughly the size of a business/credit card, you check out the dimensions first to make sure it is okay."
5,Great book on how to better connect with your audience,"This short book is packed with great insight on how to write with greater impact. In a nutshell, Words That Stick is about how to use fewer words in your communications to achieve higher recall with your audience."
1,USA,"I was disappointed that the ""Trilogy"" I bought was only the first volume of the trilogy. I feel it was misrepresented. I did not discover it right away, so didn't feel like I could pursue a refund. I did enjoy the first book."
3,"Great Looking Case, but the flip-cover won't last","Case looks great on the phone, makes it look more modern and sharp. Unfortunately the plastic flip-cover that opens up to give access to the screen is under-engineered and breaks off easily."
3,The Goat Lady,"I thought that this book showed a lot of promise. I found that I was very engaged in the text. It taught a lot of good lessons such as not to judge people. Many books describe this same lesson but this book did a good job conveying feelings. The illustrations were very realistic, which added to the book. They matched the story perfectly. I would recommend this book to other readers. It was enjoyable."
2,Generic shooter,"In fact, 'generic' is too fancy a word for this game. It tries to attempt the same sort of atmosphere seen in the recent film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, with Jules Verne-type technology in a 19th century setting. But it's so dull and uninteresting.You have the choice of playing as biplane or a blimp (hardly the best kind of combat vehicle) as you fly through several slightly atmospheric stages blasting at generic enemies and catching generic power-ups. There's almost no skill involved in it at all. And the music is some of the most boring I've ever encountered in a video-game.I can't think of anything to recommend this game. The Gameboy Advance version features slightly improved graphics and altered cut scenes, but would still never ever consider paying full price for this. If you're desperately keen then pay less than half price for the GBA version if you can and ignore the Sega release.Graphics C+Sound D+Gameplay C-Lasting Appeal D"
3,soapmaking with jenny,The dvdwas fine but in the program there was a book mentioned that that was supposed to be included with the dvd and it wasn't.
1,One star is actually much too generous.,"Don't waste your money. David Allen Grier was so funny when he performed on In Living Color, but I now know it's because he was great at supporting roles. When left alone, this comedian leaves alot to desire. The DVD is not good and his stand up routine is just awful. We saw him last night for New Years Eve in Atlantic City. Hard to believe he is the same guy. He had a ""warm up"" comedian come on before him who was hilarious. Don't spend any money on stand up or DVD's for him. You will be dissapointed. No chance here to give no stars. If I could have, I would have."
1,A Word of Advice - Skip this one,"I really like David Alan Grier. Saw him on Broadway and admired him ever since, which is why I picked up the dvd as soon as I saw it. I was thoroughly disappointed. I have no desire to view this dvd a second time."
2,not universal voltage for USA only 110 v,"The item does not specify the voltage limitations. For those of us who travel and purchased a camera for taking pictures abroad, this charger is useless."
5,One of the Best 16-bit games ever made,This is a war strategy game like Dune 2000 or Starcraft. I actually prefer this Dune to the later computer versions. This is one of the best games I ever played for the Genesis. It blows away Command and Conqueor and other 16 bit war games.
1,What negative reviews?,I would like to see those negative reviews if they were posted. Why did they get removed. It is clear that not everyone agrees with the reviews presented here. I did not find the book as informative as the others here. I found it leaves out a lot of other high-quality and very creative artists. Please return the negative reviews a mentioned in the one review so we can make our own decisions.
4,Covers the subject like a favorite blanket,"I have to say I am not a true believer,in that all the worlds ills can be cured with a look thru a kaleidoscope. I did find the book well done, nice layout,crisp bright pictures. It also started with history, and progressed thru the current crop of people building and experimenting with the scopes. Ms. Baker does a very good job of covering all the aspects of the ins and outs of the different scopes and mirror set ups. Gives the reader looking for only entertainment. Just enough information on any of the chapter subjects to make it clear and then moves on to the next.The glossary,bibliography and internet sites are a nice touch.Along with the other appendix's artists list,tips for building your own,source list and the copies of the main two patents.In all if you have only a passing interest in the what,where and how of kaleidoscopes then this book is for you. If you are more involed then you will want to add it to your collection."
2,G2 Review,"needs more compartments and it does not really hold 5 bats, you must squeeze in 4 and it barely zips."
4,Good support and price!,"I had never heard of this brand of bra before I did some research on Amazon. But as usual, Amazon provides so many selections and after reading other reviews, I decided to try the Antoinette Go2 Bra in both Black and Beige. I'm very pleased with the support provided and the fact that it is also pretty.However, I did not give it 5 stars for one reason. I'm a true 36D, and this bra runs small in the ""36"" part. The cup fits perfect, but I have to fasten it on the first set of hooks and it's a little tight. Also, had to wash a couple of times before I could wear them. The mesh tends to be a bit scratchy. As I break them in, everything's working out fine."
2,Somewhat supportive...uncomfortable not worth it,"I know my bra size and how different brands vary but this bra seemed to have been made by a ""man"" who knows nothing about women's comfort. Otherwise bra was supportive but made very, very uncomfortable. I could have paid for a bra like this at walmart and saved myself an extra $12. Hope this was helpful to others in need."
3,"""ANTOINETTE"" Go2 Bra by Lipo in a Box Latte, 38G","I gave this a 3 on potential. The size is greatly exaggerated... I bought larger than I normally wear (to take 'fancy' into consideration)and still could not get into it. So, if you're looking for a 38G, this ain't it! More a 34-36D or DD.So, not being able to even put it on, I can't give an opinion as to comfort, fit, durability, support, etc. It looked okay, not sure what washing will do to it.I sent it back for a refund ... not a replacement. Back to Bali ..."
2,Sizing way off,"Love the style, but beware of sizing: ordered my size, but cup size was 1 to 1.5 cups size(s) too small. Low rating because I must return it."
5,best bra,this is the best bra i own ive had costume bras made that didnt give me the support /comfort that this bra has the strapless bra is another great product
5,A Real Encouragement!,"I was at the meeting in Alabama when they recorded this album back in 1990/91. Like the previous review, I lost my cassette after years of use and was very encouraged to find in on Amazon in download format. This music has been a real encouragement for me through many challenging years. Lenny's call to a pure heart is truly needed in our generation. Matthew 5:8: ""Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."""
4,Toad,"Book received promptly and was in very good condition. I wish I had known whether or not the seller had more than one copy available, as I needed several copies for gifts for teachers."
3,You get what you pay for,"I was disappointed with the attachment. It'smade out of plastic, and while reasonably firm,it does bend a little. Not what you want forprecision work. Make sure you use the colletand tighten it sufficiently otherwise the bitwill sink into the wood as you work. The depthmeasurements are just a bunch of lines, numberswould be nice. I was unable to rout a straightline with the edge guide, probably because Iwas going right to left instead of left to right.I'm now in the market for a real router. HopefullyI'll get what I pay for there..."
2,Hard To Recommend This,"Not bad for the money but the edge guide's working range of 1 1/4"" to 4"" really limits its utility. The edge guide was of no use in routing a 1/2"" groove into the narrow (1 "") side of a 2 X 4. This made the router attachment of no use on my project.Dremel has the ""Shaper / Router Table"" attachment and a soon-to-be-available Plunge Router attachment you should consider. I believe the Router Table attachment would have worked for my project. Wish I'd bought it instead. I'll be buying it now too."
2,Opening is too small for a camera with zoom lens,"This case perfectly fits my Olympus E-PL5 with Panasonic 12-35mm f2.8 lens, and it offers decent protection against scratches and small bumps. The problem is that the opening at the back of the case is too small to easily fit the camera through. It is a real struggle to put the camera in the case or pull it out, and I sometimes think that in fighting with the case I might accidentally rip the articulated LCD off the back of the camera!I have the rangefinder version of this case, which I use when I have a Panasonic 14mm pancake lens on the camera, and it works well because it's easy to put the camera through the opening in the case with a small lens attached. For some reason the manufacturer didn't make the opening on the M 4/3 version any bigger than on the rangefinder version, even though the case is designed to fit a camera with a larger zoom lens. As a result, it's too difficult to use, and I've gone looking for another, better case."
2,What an absolute mess,the dauber is basically a cotton ball glues to a stick that hangs in the bottle. it drips a lot. if you have NEVER used blukote before you need to know that it is extremely messy and stains EVERYTHING! I used it on my pet rats' wounds and because they don't like to hold still it got all over my hands and clothes and their little bodies. I am not sure if it is going to help but I am heard good things and for the trouble of the mess it better work.
1,poor,CD was blank. was really looking forward to the music that was to be on the cd only to fine it was blank.
3,Audio Cassette Purchase,"The Adventures in Odyssey audio cassette tapes arrived safely and in good condition. They also play fine. However, the cassettes arrived almost one month after they were shipped. I don't think it is the seller's fault but other other items purchased via Amazon resellers have arrived in far less time."
4,Nice set but different than pictured,"When I originally placed this item in my ""cart"" it showed the box contained a porcelain tea set, pot holders, several pots, lids, pan, and a colander - all for $17.99. When I went back to check the status of the shipment the photo had changed to a different set and the price went up to [...] (I was still only charged the $17.99). The set arrived today and we did not receive what was originally pictured. We received two sized pots with lids, a frying pan, 2 pot holders, and 5 cooking utensils, no colander, no tea set. The price was still pretty good so we'll keep it, just a little upset about the deceptive photos."
5,fun.,My kids love these. We got them a kitchen set and they love to pretend cook and eat with these. For the price I wish it came with more accessories but oh well the kids still love it.
4,Pretty true to life,I think my granddaughter will enjoy this set. It is a perfect size for playing in her new toy kitchen.
2,Too small,"Ordered this to go with the kid-craft kitchen set but it's too small, hardly any wooden food will fit in the the pots and pans. Going to send it back."
5,Just perfect!,Really really cute-----very realistic and small size is perfect!!!!!! My grandson will love it with his kitchen Santa is bringing him.
1,SMALL,This set is WAY smaller than what I expected. It is smaller than most sets I have seen in the store. Very unhappy.
4,"Great set, very cute.","Bought this for my 18mo daughter. Very cute set, like the real thing, she (and my 5yr old son) absolutely loves it. Only problem so far is the handle of one spoon has come off and a handle of one pot has come off. Not sure how to get it back on except to hot glue it since it looks like it was soldered on. Also if you happen to let them play w/ the set in the tub (we put a few pieces in the tub a couple times), the screw on the lid will rust. The rest is great. Have had the set for 5 months."
4,"Really cute and ""lifelike"" pieces, but SO tiny! Are all toy pots/pans/utensils this small??!","Really cute little set. MUCH SMALLER than I expected the objects to be. I guess it's the right size for the kids' little hands, but the play food we have will not fit into these little tiny things! My son seems to like it a lot, though, so as long as he's happy cooking and eating his imaginary food, it's worth it!"
2,"Flimsy, small pots and pans","I was very disappointed when I received this today. The pots and pans are super light, so I can tell that they won't be very durable, and they are absolutely tiny. There is no way that any food would fit in them to play cook with... The only upside is that they look real... Other than that, there's no way these are worth what I paid for them..."
1,Not Safe for under 3 years old,Item description states that this is safe for 5 months to 10 years. The packaging clearly states it is for 3 years or older. We purchased these for children 6 months and older but cannot use them. They definitely have small pieces that do come off. The small knobs on the pan lids came unscrewed within a couple days. What can you expect from Chinese made toys these days anyway?
5,My son loves the toy!,My son loves to cook twice a week after he received the Chistamas gift.Looks fine and works wellVery cool gift!
5,Alex Toys Super Cooking Set,My Great Granddaughter loves the cooking set. She's just turning 3 and loves to cook me waffles all the time!
3,Size does matter,The contents of this set are small. I mean really small. The handles are flimsy and I suspect that they will not last. I do like that they are stainless steel and look like adult cookware and utensils. My child loves playing with them and that's what matters.
3,Very small,I was very surprised at how small the pots and pans are. My five year old liked them just find but I can see that she will grow out of the very soon!!
2,SMALL!,"Bought these as a gift for my daugher for Christmas and will be sending this back. She's only 2 and a half but these are even too small for her. They would look like miniature pots and pans in her kidkraft kitchen. Save yourself the time, effort and money and get something else!"
2,Should have listened to the other reviewers...is,"When they said this was a small set, like for a doll house, boy...were they right. This is a cute set but it is VERY small and I will probably not buy something like this again."
3,Should have listened to some of the reviews...,"So, I read some previous reviews on this item regarding the pots and pans being small. YES, THEY ARE VERY SMALL! The diameter of each pan is only 3-3 1/2 inches. No, these will not fit a lot of the food items that my children have. I like that they are stainless steel and they look like they are of good quality but I can't get over the size. I was going to return them but my husband doesn't think it is worth the money to ship them back. So, they are still in the box but I am trying to figure out if we should still buy an additional set at this point. I have read some reviews that the Kidkraft Deluxe Cookware Set comes with larger pots and pans. However, I didn't want to pay for 2 sets of cookware. I just wish that the manufacturer would list the dimensions of each pan in the description. I don't think that is asking too much. I guess we are going to keep them for now...:-("
2,Not Pleased.,"I ordered this set to go with my daughter's Kidkraft master cook kitchen and I was disappointed. They are so small. I purchased them for Christmas but decided to give them away, didn't want to go through the hassle of returning them as they were under $15 dollars. I ended up having to purchase the Kidkraft set to go with her kitchen which I should have done at first but wanted to say a few bucks. You get what you pay for."
3,cute but too small,I purchase this play set for pink kidkraft vintage kitchen for my daughter. This cooking set is cute but too small. I can not put any kidkraft pretend food in it.
4,"Great little set, needs replacing after three years though","This has been a great set for my daughters to play with. They are not rough on their toys but after three years all the handles have broken off one by one over the last couple of months. I am on Amazon today looking for replacement pots since we now have a bunch of ""bowls"" :)."
3,So tiny! Disappointed.,"One reason I went with this pots and pans set was that I didn't notice anyone complaining about their small size, unlike many other sets sold here on Amazon. These are TINY, though! I'll try to post pictures later, but to give you an idea, the pots are about the size of 1/2 cup measuring cups. The cooking utensils are even smaller than typical children-sized eating utensils. Not sure how long my 16 month-old twins will enjoy these, though they have had fun so far banging the pieces together and trying the lids on the different pots.I wish I could find some that are bigger--say, 1/4 to 1/2 of real size. The search continues..."
2,Small and cheap.,"I was REALLY surprised upon recieving this set, especially after reading so many positive reviews and seeing that it won an award.The set was durable and looked like mini-versions of the real thing, but SO tiny! This is one of the smallest sets I have seen yet. We put it on our KidKraft kitchen, and it looks so akward and tiny that we decided to return it for a Melissa and Doug wooden put set."
4,Wonderful toy,"I bought this for my niece for Christmas along with a set of plastic food. She was almost three at the time, and when she got to my gifts she dropped everything and wanted to play with it RIGHT THEN, which is surprising because she still had presents to unwrap. She still plays with it often, and it has not broken despite the four-year-old she lives with is prone to destroying things.She loves to imitate her mom and Popa cooking, so it's a really great toy. I am also teaching her to use the pot holders at all times!"
1,Far TOO small!!!,"Don't bother, not worth the money. The pots and cooking utensils are far too small. The pots definitely can't hold any toy food items that your child might want to play with. I'm disappointed in this purchase."
5,"the base of each pan is approx. 3.5"" in diameter....","I purchased this pan set during an Amazon lightning deal for $10.40. My grandchildren will be getting a kitchen for Christmas. They have great imaginations & will love using this set for their pretend meals.Made of stainless steel, this set is very durable. The base of each pan is approx. 3.5"" in diameter. The depth of the pans range from 1"" to 1.5"". The cooking utensils range from approx. 4.5"" - 5.5"" long.There's two small potholders too. I didn't pull them out to measure them."
5,Cooking for boys,"I got this to go with a chef's jacket and toque. My grandson really enjoys playing chef and these pots are gender neutral, allowing him to do so."
1,MISLEADING ADVERTISING !!,"This product is clearly labeled ""4500 mg"". That indicates unit size, here and in Tibet. With this product, that is not the case. It indicates their recommended portion, for which you have to pop a handful of capsules. This is unethical, possible fraudulent.I strongly discourage you to buy anything from this manufacturer, ever.If this is their advertising ethos, I wonder what their production line looks like."
4,not bad,"High quality material, and sized appropriately for a snug fit. Only problem I have with it is that it is difficult to put on. Makes you think you need 3 hands to do it."
3,It works,"I gave the Hood Hat three stars because the actual use is questionable. It goes over the lens to protect it from dirt and dust and other undesirable deposits you might encounter. It's sort of a storage device because when you're in the field using your camera, the last thing you need is a cover on your lens that might come off easily but requires both hands and some patience to put on again. Photo opportunities show up unexpectedly and taking this off and putting it on again doesn't make sense. As a cover when you're not using your camera, it's terrific."
3,Hood Hats Work,"I have 2 different sizes and they both work well. The problem is still what do you do with it when it is taken off. Stick it in your pocket or bag I guess. I like to leave mine on, but it takes up too much room in my bag when attached to my lense. Over all it is ok and does work for a lense covering and is easy to remove."
4,"Nice little lunch, just needs a container","I bought these after tiring of cooking and leftovers. They're pretty tasty and I'd definitely buy other flavors (looking into those now, heh). The only downside is that you need to bring along a microwavable container -- you can't nuke the meals in the bags they come in. Not too terrible as I've learned to keep a container at the office, but it'd be awesomer (totally a word) to have it all self-contained."
3,"Great product, bad price","Great meal like most of the Tasty Bite entrees but seriously overinflated price - same package of six meals is $12 on the manufacturer's website (free shipping there over $65). Amazon seems to have jacked up all of the Tasty Bite ""retail prices"" to show a better discount - not so."
4,"Good, but needs more veggies.","These are very tasty, I rather enjoy all the tasty bite entrees, but this one could definitely use more veggies. It's not bad at all, just could benefit from a few more green beans or some bell-peppers or something."
4,Economics text book,"The book came as described, but took so long that I had to find a replacement due to the extensive shipment time. Overall good transaction."
2,"Cheap, but adequate for light use","I'm using the hot knife attachment to cut 1/2"" thick foam rubber mats. The blade cuts cleanly and smoothly after it reaches temperature. However, it cools quickly in the foam and there's always the fear that the thin metal will break.The bigger problem is how the blade attaches to the handle. The blade screw is inserted through a bushing and screws into the handle. It's tough to tighten and regularly works loose. The last time I tightened it the screw broke off down in the handle.I'll order another one simply because it's cheap and pretty much exactly what I need for my one-shot project, but I'm disappointed at the overall poor quality. Do not by this if you have heavy duty work or need something that will last a long time."
2,Dremel 1550 T2 Versa Tip Multipurpose Tool Kit,"I purchased this tool specifically for cutting foam balls used for Christmas ornaments. After cutting only five 3"" balls, the base of the knife blade has bent. I guess the heat was responsible for this and the tool kit will have to be returned or exchanged. I am disappointed in Dremel."
2,I guess you really get what you pay for,"I was very excited to find a heat knife for what I thought was a reasonable price. It got really hot which was good but you have pay close attention to not melt things by accident. I loved it until it stopped working after 5 uses. I turned pluged it in the other day for it just to never heat up, I pushed the cord in some which I had to start doing after use 3 but nothing ever came of it.I really did love it until it stopped working."
5,Deserves the Dremel name,"This little guy gets hot in a hurry, i have only used it for about a half hour but i was pleasantly surprised by how quickly it got to temp. The little stand it comes with looks like a joke in the picture but it actually holds the iron pretty well secure due to the balance of the tool. Im happy with it, and when you consider the price its a no brainier. If you want to burn wood, buy this."
1,If 0 stars was possible that's what this p.o.s. would get,"Not even wood burning, using it for fabric, i've gone through two of these in three pairs of pants. Got about 1 hour of use out of the first one, and 10 hours of use out of the second. Both had their heating elements fail, and I'm p.o.'d! This is b.s.! Don't waste your money!"
4,good burner for the money,Bought this tool to burn the horn buds off goats. Did that very well and also burns wood plaques nicely. would recommend this tool to anyone who wants a good burner at a good price.
4,wood burning tool,"Seems to work great, hand doesn't get hot like the other one I had, that broke. This one has more to it and works well."
4,woodburning tool,"The woodburning tool is one of the best I have ever used.That is even compared to Lenk and Craftsman, that didn'tlast as long. I'll probably not use all the tips but they arethere if I need them. I hope it holds up and doesn't burnout too quickly, as the did. If it does I will buy another."
1,Already broken!,"I bought this tool for wood burning. The third time I used it, the threaded end of the tip broke off inside the iron rendering it useless. Bummer."
2,"Burns for awhile, then burns out.",I've been using the tool no more than a total of 5 or 6 hours at the most and it went cold on me.You get what you pay for.
5,little crafter,"Love this item! I can use this for several projects, from cutting, to carving, to burning unique designs. What a great tool!"
3,Tool kit.,"The product was delivered in good condition and recieved in a timely manner.We could not use it for the job we wanted to use it on. It created too much toxic smoke to cut foam for model train layouts. Would be fine for some projects , but not for ours."
4,"Good product, very fast delivery!!","Really good product!!I am very satisfied with the service of ""Poster Discount""!I would buy from ""Poster Discount"" again and again!!! :)"
2,Best Forgotten,"This novel tries to be ""Wuthering Heights"" without the gothic elements, and does NOT succeed! I'm sure few people have heard of it - which doesn't surprise me a bit - and I'm sure it'll stay that way."
4,Good product,"I bought the 6000 unit specifically for the contour sanding capability (there are cheaper units if all you want is a flat sander), and have been well pleased by the quality of result."
5,Awesome Game,"I had this game when I was a kid,and I used to love it.So,I had to get it again after all of these years.Skitchin' is basically Road Rash,but you are a roller bladder.In races,you can grab ahold of vehicle bumpers to get more closer to the finish line.There will be other roller bladers who will grab ahold of the same vehicle you're on too,so you can use combat to knock the sucker off.There are also weapons you can pick up and use.Such as nunchakus,chains,pipes,crowbars and more.You can also upgrade your skates,wheels...plus buy knee pads and other stuff in the shop,with money made from won races.There are also ramps around that you can use to pull off some cool tricks with.The graphics,sound/music in this game are fantastic.It has a great old school 90's feel to it.Overall,if you loved the Road Rash games,then you will love this too.I highly recommend it."
3,"by each new language you know, you are a new man","After reading what is available to be read about this item, I think one should know about its dimensions(weight,length and width)just to know if it fits in his pocket or in his handbag,if it is handy or it is not."
1,Like Home Movies?,"If your idea of fun is shell out your hard earned dollars to watch somebody else's poorly done home movie, then this is for you! This is not a sailing guide nor even a guide to the locales they visit. In fact they often get the names of the places visited wrong - for instance Tobago Island (Panama) instead of Taboga. Or an arrow pointed to someplace in the middle of the Lee Ward islands labeled Cartagena Columbia. Don't waste your money or time on this dog."
2,More of a Home Video - for Friends....,"It's only $2, so I'll support a cruiser. BUT - this video (wont call it a movie) was all over the place. one minute their cross the panama canal,the next minute, they're still on the other side, then their back on the caribe... They somehow went from Utila to the Bahamas in a straight shot. I dont mean to knock the video. It was nice. I was just expecting a bit more for something I paid for. This belongs on YouTube, not Amazon. But again - support your fellow cruiser and drop $2."
1,"I was so eager, then...","I was so happy to find this and eager to purchase the video. Then I watched the preview. Great imagery and captured well....well enough to watch a crewmember smile and symbolically throw their cell phone into the ocean. Nice. People take pains to recycle these things because they contain toxic materials. Duh. Then, in the next scene, the solar panels are facing away from the sun. I will wait for a better video."
1,A rip-off of another book!,"This book is a rip off of ""Everything Men Know about Women"" by Dr. Alan Francis, which is also for sale on amazon. It's a rip off of the title, and of the concept (both are blank books). This author should be ashamed of himself and you should not buy this book."
3,Do you think they could have added some NEW SOUND BYTES?,"First, the improvements over Madden 2001 for Nintendo: New players (but not up to date with the Fall 2001 NFL rosters), more challenging placekicking and punting, ""Mulligans"" (take-overs), graphics are just a tad better than 2001.Now, the downside: Aside from the fact that the COLOR of the cartridge has changed (it's black instead of blue) this is essentially the same game as 2001s, including Madden's and Summerall's commentary -- I would have thought they could have included some new phrases to go along with the repetitive ""That ball is probably 'lopsided' after that kick"" and ""You used to be able to put 'stickum' on your hands to catch those balls, now they've got those gloves..."", I mean if they're going to claim its a new game (as the title implies), how about some NEW stuff??"
4,Great Game!,"I've had this game for about a week and it is one of the best if not thee best football game I have ever played! Aside from the comments from Mr. Madden and Summerall that you hear at least 8 times a game it is fun. The controls are not that hard, I am still learning to run the ball better, but passing is not that hard! The graphics are great and you can choose Madden Classic mode to play Madden '93 just to see how far it has all come! The only other thing I noticed that could be worked on is that all the players on the sidelines wear the jersey #88!I noticed someone else put this in their review so here we go. With the Madden 2000 team I set the following records playing 8 min quarters. Culpepper passed for 730 yards and 8 TD's both records, total TD's 12, pts scored 82, total yards 872. This was against the Browns!"
1,keyword,The keyword for this game is sucks. it is just the same as madden 2001 except a mode that teaches you how two play the game and mulligans which i think is totaly stupid. i would just buy the 2001 version because it is cheaper
1,Defective,The lighter worked for a minute and I haven't been able to get it to work again. I filled it with the butane that I bought with it but it is clogged. And if it wasn't clogged it wouldn't matter anyway because the spark for ignition only works about 10% of the time. I will probably send it into the company for repair and I shouldn't have to that.
5,Oops!,"Wouldn't it be funny if you were up in the mountains in a zub zero storm at night and this thing didn't work?Foolproof is water/wind proof matches and a watch cap (navy surplus wool ski cap) to better keep out the wind/rain and start your twig fire in.You never need wear the hat, but it folds up small and being wool, it's kindling that burns like crazy. Is warm if you do wear it & covers the ears."
3,Track List,"TRACK LIST: Reggae Music Man; Ginger Girl; Bugman; Universal Way; My Body;Meet Me In Negril Tonight; ""Till The Heartbreak Is Over; Dance The Reggae;I've Got Dreams To Remember; Something For Nothing; Coming In From The Cold; Dub Man"
2,WHAT A LET DOWN!!!,"At first watching the trailer I was excited to check this game out. First thing the movies in this game are totally cool and have great graphics, but lacked in game play. I absolutely hated the camera view of this game. If it was first person then this game might of had a chance but overall this game got two thumbs down from me."
1,ridiculous,"A useless game. The voice acting is incredibly awful, I've never played a game with worse vocal talent. Graphics are okay, but having Arthur's tiny cape flutter in the wind is hardly worth whatever promotional hoopla the developers saw fit to include on the CD.Oh yes, people talk about the impressive cut-scenes, but that quality doesn't translate into the gameplay."
1,The Most Misleading Title Released in Years,"DO NOT BOTHER TO SO MUCH AS RENT THIS GAME!... I bought it, pre-ordered it even, and I have to say this is one of the worst games released on any platform ever!... I'm not even joking. This game is that bad. Seriously, the sprites for this game are microscopic and the gameplay is ackward and redundant. I was seriously disappointed with this title and am writing this review in hopes that someone out there will be spared."
2,Very shallow and lackluster,"I like the idea of this game, King Arthur, Merlin, Gwenevere, Lancelot, etc... but there is something missing. It reminds me of a really horrible version of Ultima 7 (for the PC), with no depth or cool fx. To sum up, I cannot tell you any reason to even play this game. Big disappointment. Level 2 is almost impossible, and after several attempts you might ask WHY BOTHER???"
3,THE BOTTOM LINE,"THE GAME IS GOOD, A STRAIGHT 3 STAR GAME WITH DESENT GRAPHICS GOOD PLAY AND GREAT STORY LINE. But it is missing the ahhh, that a lot of playstation 2 games do have, because your this 1 inch character on the tv screen swinging a sword back and forth calling it a combo. Legion would make an awesome psx one game but not on ps2. So rent it but don't buy it"
3,Could have been better.,"It is a great game with lots of potential. I enjoyed it. There are some missions a little harder than others. But all in all it has only taken me a few days to beat it. I would say borrow it or rent it. If you are overseas like me you really have no choice buy it or borrow it, no places to rent. Anyway, enjoy the game I did."
1,WHAT A LET DOWN!!!,"At first watching the trailer I was excited to check this game out. First thing the movies in this game are totally cool and have great graphics, but lacked in game play. I absolutely hated the camera view of this game. If it was first person then this game might of had a chance but overall this game got two thumbs down from me. Also, multiplayer is a great way to boost any games productivity."
3,could have been better.,"This game is an ok for the PS2. The graphics are not all that good and the CG's are pretty good too. Another thing I dont really like is that you have to switch your characters when fighting. That was pretty easy to get used to though. The characters are small it almost looks like PS graphics when fighting. The sound and the phrases of the characters start to get annoying after a while. Some levels it is fun to destroy the enemy and then some they just overwhelmed me and got very frustrating. The only thing I really liked was the story of the game. Where Arthur has to fight his evil sister to save england. That would proably be the only thing that saves this game. I would not say to buy this game, I would more likely say to rent it."
1,Thank God I rented it first.................,"What a disappointment! Being a huge fan of the Gauntlet series (also by Midway) and fan of the King Arthur stories, I was stoked to play this game. Something told me to rent it before buying and I am so happy I did. The play is elementary - pure and simple - no fun. The graphics are okay but the characters you are using are so tiny you can hardly make them out (and I play on a 32"" TV)..."
4,Sanding pads,"Product arrived fast and in original sealed packaging. So ok, this is not exactly like the picture but this is one situation where it is actually better to have it like this."
5,The BEST self defense DVD -EVER!,"This is by far the BEST self-defense DVD I have ever seen! This DVD taches you real street self-defense that is easy to learn and practiccal for stree use. This is the only DVD I've ever seen where they teach you with multipy angles and in slow motion. They also teach you multiple strikes, which is exactly what you need to do to win against any attacker on the street!! This DVD was as good a special forces traing in hand to hand combat training class. Buy this DVD , you will learn so much from one little DVD. I only wish they made a whole series of these DVD's!"
3,So so,"I was somewhat disappointed by the DVDFirst of all, it is labeled all regions, which is not true. You ought to have a special DVD player to watch it. Secondly, with more than ten (10) years of formal training in martial arts, I was expecting better than that regarding self defense.Three (3) stars."
2,Hard to use if you have a large baby,"I liked the idea of using an infant carrier to have my hands free while working around the house. Unfortunately, this just didn't work out for me and my daughter. She was almost twenty inches and nine pounds at birth, so by the time she was a couple of weeks old and I was ready to try out the carrier, it was incredibly awkward getting her into the thing. I'm not particularly tall and with my daughter being a big baby, I had to have my husband help me. By the time we got her in place, she was so irritated by the process, she wanted no part of it.She also didn't like facing in toward me and not being able to see. By the time, she was old enough to face outward, she was too big for me to comfortably use the carrier. This is the only carrier I tried, so I don't know if this is a problem with all carriers, but in this case, I found it to be more trouble than it was worth."
5,greatest thing,"I bought the Infantino six in one carrier before this and hated it. Our newborn was too small, the carrier was hard to figure out. Fianlly, when our daughter was a month old we found this one. It is easy to use, but a little difficult to get our daughter out of. I go on long walks with it, breastfeed with it, basically live in it. Our daughter is colicky and doesn't like to be still. So we walk all day long. I just wish it was meant for smaller than 8 pound babies, because we had to wait a few weeks before Christina was big enough for the carrier. I don't know why I spent over $200 for a stroller, because we don't ever use it."
2,Not for Short People,"I received this carrier as a shower gift and I have yet to use it. First of all, the instructions weren't complete- there was a piece I didn't know how to use as it wasn't pictured in the instructions anywhere! Also, I am only 5'0"" and no matter how tight I adjusted the thing it still hung down too low. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who is petite like me."
1,Spend the extra money on a GOOD carrier...,This purchase was a waste of money. We bought a Snugli because this Infantino carrier was worthless. It was so uncomfortable for me and for baby. Don't buy it. Buy a Bjorn or a Snugli.
3,Tough to extract,"It was very tough to put my baby in and take her out of this item. The straps are not well padded, therefore it is pretty tough on the shoulders. I always felt uneasy about the velcro hook on the one side - that was all that was keeping her in on that side. It always stayed, but I was nervous. I gave this three stars because it does a great job for the price. However, I traded expense for comfort."
3,CHEAP PRICE & IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!!,I purchased this mainly just to wear for short periods of time....when I am taking the dog outside or waiting out at the bus stop in the morning with our older daughter..It works GREAT for those occasions. It is even nice to wear around the house sometimes to get a few chores done when baby is in a cuddly mood. I definately wouldn't recommend this for wear for long periods of time unless your baby is still small. Our daughter has almost outgrown it (weight limit is 20 pounds for this model)She is almost 17 pounds at 4 months and after about 20 mins of carrying her in the carrier it starts to get at your back - even with the straps adjusted correctly. I think it's just because she is getting bigger because it was always really comfortable until now. I still would recommend this product because it is a great deal if you are just looking for a basic carrier. :-)
3,prefered a snugli,"got this product and a snugli as a gift..go for the snugli,its much more comfy..it cost a bit more but its worth it. the cozy rider carrier was very easy to place on but was the comfy with the baby's weight. shoulders ached after a few minutes..plus it wasn't roomy where the legs goes in..i had to struggle with my baby all the time..she hated it. price is cheap but not worth it."
1,not worth it,"I had bought this for my son when he was a few months old. We lived in an apartment complex on the second floor, so it was crazy to drag him and teh stroller down stairs. I had bought this to make our daily walk to the mailboxes easy. It worked great at first. When he turned 4 months old I had problems. I was packing the car to go on a trip with him in it. IT was TOO tight around his stomach that he spit up in teh back of our SUV. With him in it I couldn't even put two fingers between him and the carrier. Never used it since"
2,It's ok at best,I bought this because I wanted a carrier for short trips instead of always hauling a stroller. The price was good but it's VERY uncomfortable to wear and never sits on the body right. My daughter screamed whenever she was in it or she made her body very stiff like she was scared beyond belief. I don't feel that this carrier is very safe and it's very difficult to get baby in and out. Spend your money on a better one. Yes it is soft but look at others.
3,you get what you pay for,"I chose to add this carrier to my registry based on price and it looked comfortable. Once I get my son into it, he does enjoy it but it is very difficult to get him in and out of it. I feel comfortable once he is in there but it a major process to get him situated and I have put his legs in the arm holes more than once--- you would think that wouldn't happen but it does. If you are on a budget, this carrier will work but again you may find it is work to get baby in and out."
4,Good Buy...,"We got this carrier when my son was about 2 weeks old. We couldn't use it right away because he was so small - even though the instructions said it could hold him. We didn't feel there was enough support.Our son is 6 weeks old (10 lbs) and we are using the carrier now and our son really likes it. He just wants to be moving around and checking everything out, so this is perfect for him. It is still kinda big for him though. It's going to come in handy around the holidays.The only bummer about this is when the baby falls asleep you can't take him out without him waking up. That and the back seems to ride up, even if your baby doesn't weigh that much. I had a more expensive carrier with my daughter and it did the same thing. Overall this is a good product for the money."
2,EuroRider is better.,"Infatino's Eurorider ($35) is a better product that their CozyRider. (approx $15)I tried my 10 lb newborn in both and the Euro was simply better made and more comfortable for both of us.Even though the EuroRider costs more, it's still much cheaper than a Baby Bjorn and just as good in construction."
2,better spend a little more!,"I bought this thinking it is a good deal, but it turned outthat neither me (5.2"") nor daddy (6.2""). are comfortable having the little one in it.Even after a short period of time already the back hurts.Also it is very akward getting the baby in &out.We ended up purchasing the infant carrier from kelty- what a difference."
5,good cushions,These cushions fit well and have a thick enough padding. They are new so I cannot comment on there ability to take direct hot sun exposure yet. They are by the pool so I am interested in there ability to take the sun and the chlorine.
4,Great value for the comfort offered!,"What a great value! Was searching for two cushions but when I found this great offer for four, I could not pass up this deal. I am very pleased with product."
3,acrylic landscapes,I did not find a lot of useful information in this book. I own all of the rest of Jerry Yarnell's books so perhaps I am spoiled!
2,Acrylic; Landscapes with TV Artist Jerry Yarnell,Not as good as the regular books written by Jerry Yarnell. Not as detailed.Don't like the publisher.
2,Looks Good... and that's about it.,"I bought these headphones because they had camo on them. I've had them for about 6 months now, and they've already fallen apart even though I rarely use them because of the shoddy construction and materials. The sound is merely OK compared to other full size headphones. Everyone that's seen me with these headphones thought they looked nice though, and they keep your ears warm in the winter (one of the reasons why I wear headphones outside in the winter instead of earbuds). But they're broken now. DO NOT BUY."
2,Fashion accesory....,"Skull candy ear phones do look nice...but it stops at that. Within 2 seconds of putting them on, they hurt. The things are HORRIBLY uncomfortable and do not look or feel very solid. The sound was ok, but not great...and not very loud even with the in line volume turned all the way up.Yes they do look good, but head phones should sound great and be comfortable, looking good should be a bonus....not the entire sales point. I am very disappointed in Skull Candy. If you want good ear phones for a reasonable price, go for Sony or Senheisser. If you want a fashion accesorie...go with skull candy"
1,Total P.O.S.!,Don't waste your money on these things! You can get a far better pair of headphones for comparable or less money spent. These things are nothing more than a marketing scheme to sell a look and fashion accessory. These headphones sound terrible and are very uncomfortable. TOTAL P.O.S.!!!
4,Good Product,"Despite the low reviews for these headphones, I purchased them in the hopes of getting a better sound from my Zune. At first The sound was soft while listening to music and videos. In order to get a better quality of sound, your music files need to be uploaded to your Mp3 player at a higher quality, 192kbps or better from within the Mp3 player program (ex. zune program, itunes etc). After doin this the sound quality became a 100% beeter and louder with a good range of bass and treble. Movies sound great as well, voices and sound effect are great. The headphones reduce the outside noise a lot but not completly."
2,skullcandy gi,"If you are using these for an xbox 360 they are not good if you plan to chat and play. The game sound is awesome if all you need is game sound, but there is not a separate adjustment for game sound and chat. I went to skull website and did all of the the adjustmetns recommended on settings and it was just still impossible to hear chat over game (call of duty). Plus it plugs into your xbox (10 ft cord) and the remote. I recommend getting Turtle Beach Brand headset instead. The sound is close to the same quality and it has separate adjustments for game and chat so you can hear what you want to hear. In adition the Turtle Beach ear force X31 headset is wireless so it only has cord to remote like traditional headset. It runs about $15-20 more that Skullcandy that has all the cords. I got them at Best Buy. as i said the sound quality is great on GI skullcandy but not xbox user friendly."
4,An excellent release by Manilla Road,"It's hard to imagine why Mark Shelton and Co. were unhappy with this material when it was originally recorded. This entire disc is great. Some Manilla Road fans may find it difficult to get into upon the first few listens, but once it grabs you, it won't let go. The first two tracks, and the last two tracks are some of the most mellow music that Manilla Road ever released, but the middle six tracks are all rather heavy. Much of this disc borders more on 1970s style hard rock, rather than metal, but it's all still definitely Manilla Road. As mentioned in the last review the sound quality is not the greatest throughout, but that should be expected. I give this 4 stars because it does not quite reach the greatness of ""Crystal Logic,"" but ""Mark of the Beast"" is a definite must for all Manilla Road fans."
5,What a different world we'd have if women ruled the world...,"This book initiates a dialogue that everyone needs to take part in. What would happen if more women were at the table when decisions were being made about how much money we should allocate to education or whether we should go to war or not? If there were more women CEO's, how would that affect policies on maternity leave? This book is not about how women would do things better. In a nation that has 88% of the government run by men, it's about righting the imbalance and getting the essential perspective from women. And how new ideas and solutions can come from it. Bravo to Sheila Ellision for putting together all these women to make that simple point known."
2,Not worth the time,"A couple of essays are humorous, but most are either obvious (accept your body), or truly defy biology (men are not going to grow the brain wires needed to raise children the way women do, no matter how much we wish they would). Instead of teaching our daughters to wish evolution would speed up, we should be teaching them that if they don't want to raise children, DON'T GET PREGNANT. There are plenty of people in the world, we don't need anyone in particular to give birth, so don't if you don't want to spend time with your kids! Women have a hard time accepting reality-let's start there!"
5,Beautiful!,"I bought this as a gift for my hubby. It is beautiful... According to him, it fits like a charm and very comfortable. He abosolutely loves it!"
3,Not great Karaoke,"My husband is a huge Weird Al fan, yet he had trouble singing along with this CD that I gave to him as a gift. The lyrics and music do not match up properly"
2,Weird Al Karaoke,"I wasn't impressed with the quality of the track setup on this CD. I remembered only a couple of the songs. Also, there were no printed copies of the the words to each song like many of the karaoke CDs I've purchased."
1,Wish This Had Been Done Right,"You're better off with a vocal remover device and original CDs than this. Note that none of Al's originals appear here, like Generic Blues, Good Enough For Now or Christmas at Ground Zero. This is a load of generic karaoke versions of songs Al did parodies on. They aren't his arrangements IMHO. BTW it's ""I Want a New Duck"" ---Getit? I don't think this company did."
2,Not for the casual Escher fan.,"Make no mistake. This isn't a comprehensive book for the Escher fan who wants to look at all his pretty pictures. It is a highly academic (no problem there, unless you're looking for, like I said, pretty pictures) book that focuses on basic patterns. It doesn't have many of the drawings that introduced me to his work in the first place. It's not the coffee-table book I was looking for, but that's my problem. It does have volumes of text for the so-inclined."
5,Excellent resource; bueatiful reproductions,"This is a very in-depth examination of Esher's work, including the mathematics behind his symmetries. This book is a must for Escher fans. If you aren't a fan, this book may make you one."
1,Money Down the Drain,"Before I write anything else, I must say the flea zapper does work. It stuns fleas which allows you time to place them in a ziplock bag to dispose of later. However, it makes a very high pitched sound similar to having your ears ring unexpectedly and must be cleaned after each flea is stunned. Cleaning the unit requires each flea be brushed into the ziplock bag which makes using the Flea Zapper a two person job. To top it off, the Flea Zapper does not work well on longer fur. It is most assuredly, not the natural flea treatment for which I had hoped. Save your money and use a flea comb with a disposable cup full of soapy water."
2,ESPN NFL PRIME TIME,I BELIEVE GIVING THIS SORRY GAME A 2 STAR RATING IS BEING VERY GENEROUS. IT TRULY PLAYS SORRY. THE GRAPHICS (...). NUFF SAID. WITH TECHNOLOGY NO GAME SHOULD BE THIS SORRY.
3,Ok for the Price Paid,"Delivery per expectations. Missing hardware (whammy bar, hex, etc.) and frets were sharp. Put in request for replacement. Per Amazon fabulous service, no issues, replacement shipped right away.Received replacement. Pickup selector broken off. Somewhat of a big deal. Tone control knob swivels all over the place, easily fixable.Good Stuff:Maple neck really nice. Intonation good. No warping. Stays in tune relatively well even after I abused it with whammy. Tone a little muddy but not horrible.Bad Stuff:Tuners too close together. Pickup selector stem broken. For the price I paid decided to keep it anyway. Typical POS chinese mfg Qc stuff.In short, if you get it for under $100 keep it. If much more, dump and go for Rondo Music or Epi/Squiere. Squire quality not as good as Squire in my opinion. Epi inspected in US prior to distribution. Always been pretty good.Keep rockin."
3,HIT OR MISS,"I got mine 10 years ago when they first came out and sold for $129. They had issues - mainly the pickup selector switch being loose and bad.I had to replace mine (I'm a guitar tech). The top is photo and the body is agathis (solid wood but bright sounding). I replaced the nutwith a graphite one and intonated the guitar. It plays and sounds great! The neck wood will shrink causing the fret ends to jut out which canbe easily filed down. These guitars are out of production and due take some work to set up and play. If you get a decent one, it will be a keeper!"
5,Precision Drill Bits,I purchased the work station and once assembled with my 8000 and these bits I have an awesome drill press.
5,A dremel should be in everyone's work bench,"The Dremel 628 is a great tool for someone who needs that special tool for a certain job. I use mine on occation, but when you need it, it's there to do the job. Quite a good value."
3,"Not very pleased, bit broke!","I picked these up for some small scale Warhammer 40K modeling. Within less than 5 minutes, the 1/32 bit broke! I noticed that it was bending while I was using it, but I figured it would be at least strong enough to pin one model. Perhaps this product should only be used with an automatic Dremel tool, and not a pin vice?I'm going to try a cobalt bit next, and hopefully that will do the trick."
5,perfect size,Just what I needed to drill through the book boards I am using. Will need to expand my sizes eventually.
4,Nice bit set.,"I bought this drill bit set to use with the Dremel drill press to do some detail drilling work on a guitar. They work just like drill bits should, and I have no complaints. I used them to freehand drill several holes as well as using them in the press, and they worked fine."
3,VERY tiny bits,"My mistake, I did not realize the small size of these when I ordered, so not the fault of Dremel. I was able to use the 1/8 size to make pilot holes, doubt that I will ever use the others, one looks like a sewing needle in size."
2,Good but could be better,"Well I needed a drill and I already had a dremel! So I went ahead and bought a set of bits, but the first time I used one it broke. I doubt I'll ever use the tiny one again, but it's not a good start."
4,combined with Dremel Keyless Chuck = OUTSTANDING!,I rated this product 4 stars on their own. Good quality set with a very useful organizer. It does the job and they were cheaper on Amazon than they were at the local hardware store. When used with the Dremel 4486 MultiPro Keyless Chuck this kit is easily worth 10 stars. It lets you use the same chuck without having to use different sized collets for the corresponding bit. Absolutely great together!
4,handy to have,"These are great to have around so you don't have to carry a drill with you. Make sure you have the 4486 Chuck first, though."
3,Awww...how cute,"I'm a Dremel fanatic, but two of these TINY bits broke the first time I tried to use them--one on a small piece of antler, and the other on a 1/4"" Fimo (vinyl) bead. The size selection should be ideal for tiny projects, and the little case is convenient, but in my experience, the bits are just too fragile for anything but styrofoam or maybe lightweight plastics, in which case you could probably just use a heavy needle or pin. I bought this set for two specific projects, and it failed on both.I'd rate it lower, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because maybe user incompetence is to blame...and at least they didn't bend."
4,Dremel drill bits,Drill bits seem satisfactory. So far have only drilled in wood. Package is nice fit into 220-01 work station. Would have rated 5 stars but package is difficult to get open.
2,Disappointing!!!!,"I was looking very forward to Arctic Thunder for the PS2 as I love the Arcade game. Unfortunately, Midway did a rush job on this game, and it is rather disappointing.The graphics are choppy, making it hard to figure out what is going on sometimes. It is also hard to figure out which weapon you have, and which enemy you are firing it at.Unfortunately, it appears that Midway did not take their time with this game. It could have been a big hit, instead this one will soon find its way in used game bins everywhere.Save your money for a better game!!"
1,Not Georgi Ivanovitch Gurdjieff - if you're interested,This book is a hoax.....riding on the coattails of the Master.For Shame.
3,Treatment for our son's refractory gout,"Perhaps he has an extreme case of gout, but our son found it only somewhat effective in treatment of his gout."
5,So far so good!,I have been taking these for a month and so far so good. My feet certainly feel better and overall I feel better. Either it is all in my head or my body may have been missing something that these provide.
4,"Not ""Great"", but ""Really Good""","Immediate results. Went from ""severe"" to ""not too bad"" overnight. Within another 24 hours, I was at ""mild discomfort."" Unfortunately, it never took me all the way to ""cured."" It leveled off at ""mild"" and stayed there. After a week, I finally went to see a doctor who took me the rest of the way with prescription medication. Still keeping the Goutrin on hand in case of any flare ups though. No complaints about the product because it worked so quickly - and believe me, when you're in that kind of pain, any relief of any sort is a blessing."
2,Didn't work that well for me,"Oh well I guess I'll try something else. It's all just a shooting game anyways with gout remedies, I guess I missed this time. Good luck to you."
2,"Doesn't seem to work on some people, which includes me","Unfortunately I had the worst gout attack of my life after I started to take this product... So looks like it is not working so well, at least for me. Of course I understand that the reactions may differ from person to person, and I'm also not so sure whether the attack was triggered by the Goutrin itself or not, but personally this incident made me to decide not to use this product again."
2,Slightly helpful,This product only helped my gout slightly. I found more relief from 1000mg of vitamin C and lots of water.
1,Ineffective,"These pills did nothing to prevent or mitigate my gout. What did work was going to the doctor and asking for his help in making the gout go away. I started taking Allopurinol and took Colchicine until I was past the danger stage. Since then I have not had a single flare-up. If you are having serious, incapacitating flare-ups, forget the homeopathic cures. They are not strong enough and do not attack the root of the problem. Get to a doctor and get some real help."
1,Not effective for myself,"I can't notice any difference after 60 days of daily use. Attacks are just as frequent and intense. This was the last in a long line of natural ""remedies"" that has convinced me to listen to my doc and get on the meds."
2,Not a game for a serious football fan,"It was ok. But I am a serious footbal fan so I did not like it to much. There are no rules and no refs. You can tackel the person any way you want to. Even after the play has ended. And the passing game is very cunfusing. It is hard to pass to a reciever that you want to pass to. If you want a good ruled realistic game, you should get NFL 2002 or NCAA 2002. Those are serious football games. On the other hand, if you just want to tackel and have fun, get this game."
4,Nfl blitz 2002,"For anyone who knows the blitz games, this one looks top notch. The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are great looking and of course the bottom line is, its a Blitz game, so the fun level is just as good as ever. However, the power up codes have their flaws...specifically the no first downs, infinate turbo, and no interceptions codes for some reason don't work on the games shipped and sold by the retailer, and Midway is currently looking into fixing the problem somehow. It's still a great looking game, and a fun one, but I recommend waiting a few months where perhaps titles on the shelf then would have the glitch fixed."
4,Blitz has huge HITZ,"This game is pretty much just like the other NFL Blitz games, but this game has 100% more better graphics."
1,Only for collectors,I love nfl blitz games except this one and here is why. Bad AI on your team sometimes they just stand their when they have a good chance for a sack. Changing players take to long so good sacks are rare. 2003 is abetter version
5,Credit Card free gaming,"this is not a game. This is the way you can pay for the monthly memberships of any one of three different games. I have used these for a while and amazon is a great way to get these, because I can purchase them with my checking and not have to worry about what day the charge will happen."
3,Sony Game Card,"90 Day Game Time Card (Everquest, Everquest II, Planet Side)Worked as intented, wasnt used when i got it as with some places online"
2,"Long on Options, Short on Gameplay","After playing this game a couple of times it leaves much to be desired. The general management functions are easy to use and offer plenty of unique and exciting oiptions. However, actual gameplay is not very good. The camera angles are limited and the polygonal appearance of the player animations are aweful. The ""television style"" appearance complete with celebrations and analysis of the game are mostly just annoying. You can dress any piece of garbage up but in the end, underneath it all, it's still garbage. Can't wait to unload this title. The only bad one from EASPORTS to date."
3,Cartoon hockey,"How upsetting. The first Playstation2 game Ive ever played and its a far step down from EA's NHL games of the past. Great animations and audio but EA left out one thing, realistic hockey. Here is why I am so dissapointed with this one...1.) Everything is supposed to be funny2.) Player Cards take away from the whole point of the game(to win by scoring the most goals)3.) Powerplays are the worst. Teams that are killing the penalty turn into Ironman and skate up the ice like a rocket.(instead of clearing the puck like they should.)4.) EA still hasnt studied four on fours to understand when they come into play.5.) Broadcast camera angle is changed to a unplayable mess of confusion.6.) You need to be an NHL star to score in hard mode, literally."
4,best,best game I have ever played besides Gran Turismo 3 and World cup. The grapics make 20x better than NHl 2001. The instres is outstanding. Ea sports made this game really great.
2,...,"This game was fun for about 5 games against the computer, then fun for another five games against my brother, and then I got tired of it. The graphics were ok, but this game was really easy. I didn't lose a game against the computer even when I was playing Canada(the best team in the game) on difficult. The game makes me angry at those damn Canucks for ever inventing the sport. It is kind of fun to hit people, but every game is the same. I beat the computer in a shutout most of the times I played. Rent this game, definitely don't buy it."
3,What is going on at EA???,First off I have to say that I have owned every version of NHL from EA Sports ever made dating all the way back to NHL for Genesis in 1990. And what gets me is that this is the WORST version of the game they have ever released. I wasn't a huge fan of 2001 but it was at least solid and I know I owned it on the PC so the graphics were better but still the PS2 graphics are somewhat weak. THe controls are fidgity and the comentary oh my lord who thought that would be funny. The Franchise mode is still pathetic...(Lets see some impressive offseason simulation.). The game has become either a fast paced mash of buttons or just floating in unleashing slap shots at the goal. Strategy is comming along but still the game is all arcade...
3,Very Disappointing,"I looked forward to this game for three months. What a disappointment. I thought that NHL 2001 was the greatest game ever, and apparently it still is. The graphics of the players seem sacrificed to improve the graphics of the crowd. The rosters are not that current (e.g. Lindros is still on the Flyers.) More than anything, the Color commentary is the biggest surprise. Last year, the commentary was sometimes repetitive and silly, but pretty good. At least they had real announcers. Now, there are two goofballs that crack the corniest jokes you've never heard. The excellent gameplay is basically the same, therefore salvaging a 3 Star rating."
2,Either Its to Easy or to Hard,This game is ok it has good features But i cant fiqur how to make the game normal eiather its too hard or to easy i can score 18 goals in the first quarter on easy & Medium or score none on difficult....EA Sports has good games like Madden 2002 & 2003 But tyhis game lacks EA Thinks its fun to score 80 points im 1 minute but its not its very boring Id rather give it to the poor But Theyed Be Discusted Its not even good enough for a freezbe it not even good for a coaster...Please Rent Before Buying
5,sooo original,"this is the best music i have heard in a long time. glow has just the right amount of retro, underground flair, mixed with the appeal of pop. this is going to be the next big thing in music. just you wait and see."
5,GREAT,"I have seen this band 3 times locally and I can tell you, they are GREAT! They sound just as they do on the CD. The music is easy to get attached to."
3,It's not like the Original Cinderella,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter, she loves Cinderella. I'm used to the original voices and artwork, so this set seems a little odd to me but my daughter loves it."
4,Granddaughter enjoyed it.,"They already had Cinderella 1. The second Cinderella was not as good, but they did enjoy Cinderella 3. Found something they didn't have."
2,Glitchy,"I ordered this for my daughter and we put in the Cinderella III DVD. From the beginning, it was a little glitchy, but it would still continue playing. But half-way through, it just got stuck. I would even try skipping over it, but everything after that was not going to play. There were no scratches or fingerprints on it because it was new. It had something to do with the recording, because we sent the first one back and got a replacement one, and the second one did the exact same thing....it got stuck in that same scene the first one did. I never tested out the other discs, they could work just fine, but I never found out. Amazon was great to give me a refund, I'm grateful for that."
5,Great follow up,This was a nice way to follow up the original one. And it is nice to have the collection of all of them.
2,Cinderella 3-it undid the original classic,"I loved Cinderella all of my life. Saw Cinderella 2, and that was good, but C3 was TERRIBLE! I wouldn't bother with owning or watching 3. It was a poor attempt just to make some money in dvd sales."
5,cinderella II and III,The story of Cinderella and Prince Charming continues and the adventures are great fun. Cinderella is my two year old granddaughters favorite
4,Just good entertainment,* * * I purchased this for my granddaughter. These movies are just good old fashion entertainment. * * *
5,"Cinderella 2 not the greatest, but ...",Cinderella 3 had all the makings of a Feature Presentation. It is a shame Disney did not release it as such.
5,An excellent value.,"Fifa 2002 for the Playstaion One is an excellent value. There is some great gameplay which easily rivals that found in its Playstaion 2 and Gamecube brother. The graphics are not as good, but since the game is viewed from overhead camera angles, they do not really hurt the game. This is better than 2002 Fifa World Cup on PS1, as it is faster and more exciting. Both are excellent soccer games, but this is really the cream of the PSone crop."
2,Not so great,When I first found out FIFA 2002 was coming out I already knew that there was going to be a World Cup qualifier since the World Cup was going to be this year. But i did not know that there was going to be a separate World Cup game because FIFA 98 had qualifying and the world Cup 98 in France. Also it doesn't have the names of all the players. Like for El Salvador it says N. 5 and other teams. Maybe in the back of the manual instead of announcing a different game they should say World Cup 2002. I'm very disappointed
5,NOTHING LIKE IT!!! REAL FOOTBALL EXPERIENCE!!!,"I'VE BEEN HOOKED ON FIFA'S SERIES SINCE FIFA 97, AND IT'S GETTING BETTER EVER YEAR, ALL THE TEAMS, ALL THE PLAYERS AND BETTER YET ALL THE NATIONALS TEAMS, I LOVE SWEATING THE SHIRT TRYING TO QUALIFIED MY COUNTRY TO THE WORLD CUP, THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL THE FOOTBALLERS!!!"
4,How does driving into a billboard make the car flip?,"If you want an arcade-perfect version of the game, you'll have to get the sega saturn version. But this version is fun too. It's fast, responsive, colorful, and sounds great. You race against the clock through very colorful branching stages to get to one of five different endings. This isn't a realistic racing game - you'll see that when plowing into a tree at 180mph causes the car to fly 20 feet into the air and flip a few times while the passengers lay on the road uninjured and only slightly dazed. The sound is really good and you can select one of four soundtracks (radio stations) to listen to. I believe one soundtrack is unique to the Genesis version, but I could be wrong.If you collect classic games, be warned! Like with Space Harrier or After Burner, once you play the Genesis version it may be very difficult to enjoy the much more choppy Sega Master System version."
2,Not Supported Very Well by Philips,"I have owned this MP3 player for almost a year. It does put out great sound. However, it will not play playlists. It puts songs on the player in alphabetical order. Philips tech support and web site said there was going to be a Firmware upgrade for it, but that never happened. Now, the player won't work with Media Player 11, and Philips said if I want it to work, I need to go back to Media Player 10. The earbud headphones it comes with are too large and hurt when they are in my ears. Yes, it does drain the batteries when it is off -- I am always having to change the battery. I bought rechargeable ones, and they never register as a full battery on the player's battery meter, but maybe this is just how rechargeable ones are??Since this player has been on the market for some time and is not supported well by Philips, I would recommend buying something else.It would've been a decent player if it would've worked like the manual says and played playlists. . ."
4,Back-UPS RS 800VA,"I found that the Back-UPS RS 800VA meets my needs for a power backup system. The unit will supply power to my PC for about 10 minutes before placing the PC into XP Hibernation mode, there is 5 minutes of backup power left at this point. This unit also protects the PC from power surges.The only two draw back I have found to this unit are:1) That the 3 Nema 5-15R outlets power is not controlled by the units front panel on-off switch These outlets are surge protection only, the four battery backup outlets are controlled by the on-off switch.2) Unit is noisy. I don't know if this noise is coming from an internal fan or from the AC power converter."
5,Beautiful to the Last,"An incredibly beautiful read. Beekman managed to cover an amazing array of topics in the dutch east indies without leaving out pertinent points about life during the dutch colonisation. From a miraculous sea adventure of an early explorer to the meticulous descriptions of tropical plants by a blind naturalist, this book mixes adventure, romance and history delighfully. All the authors are well-chosen and well-represented.Despite all her troubles, Indonesia has always, and will always be beautiful."
4,HOYA SKYLIGHT FILTER,I AM GLAD I COULD GET THE HOYA FILTER SKYLIGHT (1A) FROM THE AMAZON AT VERY AFFORDABLE AND CONVENIENT PRICE.THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO PROTECT MY MAIN CAMERA LENS AND IMPROVE THE SATURATION OF PICTURES CAPTURED.
4,Twenty-first Century Wake,"It's good to find a new book on ""Finnegans Wake,"" the first I've seen in this century. Most of the books written about Joyce's last ""novel"" were written a generation or more ago. This compact text is comprehensive and adds thoughts and ideas I've not found in some of the older, more voluminous works. It's also readable, not requiring an advanced degree in literary criticism. There's no way to make ""Finnegans Wake"" an easy read, but ""A Word in Your Ear"" offers practical advice that advances our understanding of Joyce's ""book of the dark."""
3,Not the place to start,"I bought several books when I decided to read Finnegan's Wake. This has proven to be the least helpful. I would recommendJoyce's Kaleidoscope: An Invitation to Finnegans Wake,Joyce's Book of the Dark: Finnegans Wake (Mark H Ingraham Prize),A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake: Unlocking James Joyce's Masterwork,How Joyce Wrote Finnegans Wake: A Chapter-by-Chapter Genetic Guide (Irish Studies in Literature and Culture), andAnnotations to Finnegans Wake-- in that order before A Word in your ear.Kitcher's invitation has especially reawakened my interest in the dark book. I find myself in that late stage of life when I wonder, with HCE, ALP and Joyce if it's all been worth it."
3,Deep... but somewhat off the reservation,"Some of the thoughts evoked by the author are very deep and insightful. If you enjoy GW's series, it will help you to find some new levels of appreciation for the cleverness. Reveals some of Severian's relatives... the clues were there, but I never noticed them.But.... some of his ideas are just nuts. The part I dislike is that if the author does not know the answer and cannot come up with a clear deduction, he'll almost make it up. While he uses text from the book, he will almost (not literally) try to prove red is truly green ""because they are opposites and that's the key! Yes, the key! So, during Christmas... um, they go together... and it's a Christian holiday, so OBVIOUSLY Gene Wolfe meant for us to see that!""Good to read, but take it with a grain of salt. I'd prefer less reaching and more ""I just don't know"""
1,I wouldn't buy this,"I bought it hoping for some good, well-argued literary criticism. It's not that. In fact, it's little more than an expanded glossary with some very unfortunate lacunae (for example, the Hierogrammates are given little more than a mention)! The author seems caught up in the arcana arguing by implication that Wolfe is seeking not much more than the consternation of his readers through twistings and turnings of identities. Perhaps that is one of the tools he uses in his writings (there does seem to be a consensus on that point though I remain unconvinced), but it isn't really all that interesting as an end. Of far greater value -- and as little as I understand him, I know this to be true of Wolfe's intent --is what the author is intending to TEACH. Not a word about that.If you like tortured reasoning and twisting character identification, you might like this book. I, however, regret the time I spent with it."
4,Deeper Understanding,"Gene Wolfe is an author that is very difficult to fully understand. It is possible, and enjoyable, to simply read through his masterpiece, The Book of the New Sun, and read it simply as a story. But there are many questions left unanswered. Why are so many characters left unnamed? Why does Severian consistantly mishear or misunderstand what people say? What is that play all about? These questions are answered in Borski's collection of essays about The Book of the New Sun.It may seem foolish to some to buy a book explaining another book, but it will truly enhance your understanding and enjoyment of Wolfe's magnum opus. Many of the things Borski explains will simply seem to click. ""Oh, I get it now... it makes so much sense."" But you would probably never figure it out on your own, or even realize there was something to figure out. Borski's work is a very useful and enjoyable way to more fully understand one of the greatest works of american fiction."
4,solar labyrinth,Borski's book seems to be more of a personal response than I expected it to be but it is WELL WORTH the read if you have already read the books yourself. It gave me some new insights to think about.
2,completely absurd,"The author has obvious knowledge of, and enthusiasm for, the Book of the New Sun. But be warned: this book consists of a sequence of highly contrived theories, often of the form ""but isn't it just possible that..."", completely unsupported by the text. Or, rather, apparently ""supported"" through numerology, detailed etymology, and an elaborately contrived symbolic system (""Wolfe ... only uses the word 'gold' as a character attribute to link the various members of Severian's bloodline"") which is developed without much evidence, and then used to ""prove"" further hypotheses.This kind of thing can be fun, and if you enjoyed scouring web forums for conspiracies in Lost built from a mountain of minutiae and coincidence, you might enjoy this too. But anyone looking for a serious, insightful study of this complex work should look elsewhere."
5,"Genuine multi coated filter, excellent product!!","This is a genuine multi coated filter, you can confirm it by seeing a reflection of any object on the glass surface; it shows up with a green tint. Tested this with indoor and outdoor shots and did not affect picture quality. Constuction quality is excellent and has a lightweight alluminium ring/body. Extrememly durable. Hoya is among the top three filter manufacturers in the market and at this price this is a steal!!Canon EF 70-200mm f/4 L USM Zoom Lens with 57"" Tripod & Tripod Collar + Hoya 3 (UV/CPL/Warm) Filter Set + Cleaning Kit for Canon Rebel T1i, T2i, T3, T3i, EOS 50D, 60D, 7D, 5D Mark II, 1D, 1Ds Digital SLR CameraCanon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only)Hoya SUPER HMC Haze UV(0) - Filter - UV - 52 mmHoya HMC UV(C) Filter - UV - 67 mm"
4,Good product,"I only got this as a protection to my actual lens. From what I have read, UV filters don't create any type of photographic effect on dslrs, so the main thing is to have one of these to protect your lens without negatively effecting the picture quality. While I am not a professional and don't blow my pictures up to wall size, I have not noticed any decrease in picture quality for what a typical hobbyist would need it for, so I'd say it does exactly what it is supposed to do."
3,Awkward to use,"THis does exactly what you'd think, but its rather awkward to use as the nob that controls the dimmer is pretty flush to the unit... I wont be using it."
5,WORKS ADEQUATELY,I AM WELL SATISFIED WITH THIS DIMMER THAT IS EASY TO USE WHERE I HAVE IT. I DIM A SOFT PINK LIGHT BULB FOR NIGHTTIME USE.
1,almost impossible to use,"this ""made in china dimmer"" is a piece of crap. the little black turn knob is impossible to use from a comfortable position. you have to get up and tip the lamp to find it. turning the little bitty knob is difficult for anyone with even medium sized fingers. there is no consistancy or smoothness in the transition from medium brightness to dim, the lamp just goes out. will someone in the USA PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE make a descent dimer switch!!!!!!! i would pay 20.00 dollars for one that would last more than 1 year and have a range of intensities. i sued to have one and it was great, made in the USA. why are we borrowing money from china to pay them for this crap?"
4,"they work OK - bought 3, one burned out after a year","These work pretty well. They don't dim all the way down on a 60W bulb, but I just want them to go to about 85% of full power, in order to keep my incandescent bulbs from burning out so fast."
1,Attracts Fleas!,"I have a beagle/jack russell dog who while she doesn't have a bad flea problem, still needs some protection. I read the previous reviews on this flea collar and decided to give it a try. Thankfully, it did not have a chemical smell but a rather pleasant aroma. I left it on my dog for a week. When I saw a flea or two, I would press the cut off bit of collar on them in hopes of killing them. Well, they just jumped off, not one bit deterred!I found myself plucking fleas off my baby; she might as well not be wearing the collar. I did take it off. There are better products out there than this collar which in my opinion, is totally useless. Save your money. (And yes, I did spray for fleas around the house and yard). The collar is more of a flea attractor than a flea de-tractor. :("
2,Not working well,We bought this collar for our dog and the two of the same brand's cat collars and they are not working. We put the collars on after giving each of them flea baths and we are still discovering fleas on them. The collars do not seem to be killing off any new ones that find their way onto our animals. I'm getting a little frustrated because we've tried a number of different methods without a whole lot of luck.
5,Great if you don't want to use/have a credit card and cheaper than a $[...] prepaid visa,SOE game cards are great for those who don't have a credit card and don't want to spend $[...] on a prepaid visa card.I've had bad luck with SOE's billing so a gamecard allows me to play a month or 3 without worrying about being charged for the month I wish to stop playing.
1,Do not buy this for EQ2 Extended,"This card is the obsolete version of the new universal card.It will not with EQ2 Extended and cannot be exchanged for station cash. Strangely it is also more expensive than the universal card. At this time Amazon do not have the universal card in stock. Gamestop, Walmart and a myriad other stores should be checked instead if you want to play on the extended server."
1,"Nice, but the XBOX version will be better.","A fun hockey game, but if you are going to pick up an XBOX, I'd wait and snag the XBOX version of this games for enhanced graphics and new gameplay modes. This game is very unrealistic by design, but also incredibly fun. A good addition for hockey fanatics."
5,The hottest hockey game ever!!!,"If u are looking for a game this is it. This is the most intense, hard hitting hockey game that u have ever seen. This game is even updated the players that have been traded in the off season are in there new teams. When ur slap shot goes to 120 mph that is extreme. One of the things that i espeacially like is the intense bored hitting and the glass shattering. I cant forget about the fighting, it is just amazing. If you are a real hockey fan u will never get bored of this game. This should be the next game that u HAVE to buy. All i have to say is Amazing."
5,Interesting read.,"This book shed new light, enlarged on existing ideas, regarding Abelard as a person and as a philosopher, logician, or whatever shelf you put him on. I especially enjoyed the sections dealing with his theological writings, as I'm not much of a philosophy fan, although that section was well written. Also interesting was the referencing to other writers' opinions of Abelard and his body of work, whether pro or con, through the ages."
5,Great non-linear optimization tool,"Anyone in operations will find something of value in this book. There is a good variety of problems, and good explanations of how to solve them. The book is accompanied with Palisade.com's Risk Optimizer software. Be sure to check their web site; they post updates to software, and they seem like a pretty good company to deal with, as well.With his various books and software, Dr Winston really helps the business manager leverage his productivity."
1,Software is 10 day trial version only,"I was disappointed to discover that RISKOptimizer software included with this book was just a 10-day trial version. After that, you have to buy the $700 license for the software. For books like this, obviously aimed to a large extent at business students, it seems much more logical to include a reduced capacity version with a perpetual license, as other similar books do."
1,"The Dancing is Fine, but where did they get these songs?","None of the songs used in this album were popular, recognizable Disney songs. They were all from Disney, but they were all rather obscur. I was majorly disappointed."
1,A joke,"The entire Dance Dance Revolution is a joke, to put it mildly. If you are a two left foot the concept seems attractive, but in practice you first need to buy the expensive and hard to find dance pad (a floor mat with sensors that connects to your PS and which you hop on), and then the game gets boring and difficult quickly. The music is the worst part, because you can't mix your own. This is a waste of money."
5,More DDR fun hits our shores! ^_^,"While a lot of DDR fans were a little dissappointed with the US mix of ddr, the Disney Mix is almost identical to the japanese version. And original is always better ~_^This game is flat out fun, and it's a tad bit easier then the normal ddr, so it's good if you're just beggining. (especially since this game doesnt boo you. lol) It's bright, colorful, and is full of raver looking disney characters...not that you'll be really looking at any of the graphics except for the flying arrows. However, if you think this game would be TOO easy, just give It's A Small World Ducking Hardcore Mix a shot. It's wild!Oh ya, if you dont already own one, be sure you get a dance pad...the experiance is nowhere near the same playing on a controller!Like Donald says (or rather quaks)at the begging of the Ducking Hardcore Mix, ""my life is the bass!"""
1,Beware for cancelling orders,"Beware! If you purchase an item on a weekend and then try and cancel your order on Monday, you will still have to pay shipping. I got screwed and I won't ever order from amazon again."
5,DEUS-EX RULES LIKE HELL!,"This game is so cool,you have to play it! It's kinda hard,but once you get in to it you can't stop! So buy the game today."
4,ok,"I really like how they put an rpg twist to this game. but it still is pretty annoying though. one thing is that its one of those games that takes you hours to figure what to do.I love the different weapons and tools you get, you get everything from a pistol to a lockpit. The story is very good. overall its ok."
4,FPSRPG,"Deus Ex seamlessly combines two of the biggest genres in video gaming: first person shooters and role-playing games. While the graphics are certainly dated by today's standards, the game is not short on fun. The weapons are customizable, all of the nano-aug powers are upgradeable, and the skill system is easy to learn. This game is great for RPG fans and FPS fans alike, and even better for fans of both."
4,Great game - not perfect - but great,"Deus Ex is a FPS with a science fiction bent that actually produces an interesting combination. You don't need the cheat codes to succeed in the game. Game is very long and the plot is pretty interesting (although I am only 85% done with it). Graphics are pretty good and game play is good. Clearly the complexity of the plot and the augmentation power-ups make the game unique. Controls are pretty clumsy but can be operated efficiently as experience is gained. The medium level is pretty easy, so I bet replay is decent playing at a harder level. Overall a pretty solid and engrosing game."
4,One of the best games ever,"I played the PC version of the game a while ago and it was one of the best games ever made. I got the PS2 version because I wanted to play it again but didn't have the CD anymore. The PS2 version has the same great plot and innovative gameplay. The only drawback is the levels are split into smaller zones, so there's more loading time. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
5,Deus Ex - The best game ever,To make this brief: I play lots of games and this one is truly remarkable. The best one I've ever played. I've been wanting to play it for years but I don't like playing games on the PC. I found this one for the PS2 and bought it at a very low price and began to play it. There is so much to do and explore. It's not just shooting your way into completing your goals. You can use stealth or shooting sprees. There are puzzles to solve and a multitude of ways to solve these puzzles. The scenes are enormous. Take your time to play the game and explore each level. It's amazing.
4,Solid game,"nothing special, but pretty good action and storyline. Only bad part is that the graphics look like they're from 1997. It is definitely worth the money though."
4,PAINFULLY UNDERRATED GAME!!!,"I don't know why, but this is a PAINFULLY UNDER-RATED GAME! (It's so underrated it's a darn shame!!!!)If you like first-person shooters and role-playing video games, pick this game up NOW!!!!! It's well worth the money, you won't regret it. You play as a futuristic cop with bionic nano-bot implants. As you progress through the game, you upgrade your characters abilities.Here are some of the cool things your character can do:1) Hack into computers.2) Lock pick or blast your way through doors.3) Bypass electronics.4) Kill or knock out your enemies.5) Use a ""spy drone"" (i.e. - a CAMERA that you control) to freely fly around your environment!6) Swim or crawl through tight spaces.Lastly, this is a long game. There is a lot of exploring to do. I could go on and on about how cool this game is but if you are not convinced by now, then you never will be. ;)"
2,Tasted packaged and too sweet.,"I am a big fan of Tasty Bites, since we have no good Indian or Thai food in my area, but this one is one of the few I'd skip. The sauce was overly sweet and had a bland flavor, and the veggies were mushy. It didn't taste like any stir fry I have had before.Don't judge the wonderful Tasty Bite brand by this one - try the Jaipur Vegetables or one of the curries or lentil dishes instead - they are really delicious!"
3,Too big!,"I purchased this and used it on a standard 9"" store bought crust, and it was just too big. The part it did cover didn't burn, but I will have to get one that is smaller to fit over the store bought crusts. At least I have one now for when I use a real pie pan."
4,Very Helpful,"Very Helpful product for studying for the OCN! I just took the test and passed...and all I studied was this book! The questions in the book were very similar to the ones on the test, and the book gave a good overview of all the areas you need to learn. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good study book for OCN! Good luck!"
5,Study Guide for the Core Curriculum for Oncology Nursing,I would recommend this study guide to anyone that is getting ready for the OCN Certification. The questions in this book are written quite similar to the test and was a tremendous help when it came to studying. YEA I passed......AAAA++++ for this book
4,Pricey but I'm glad it exist,"Ridiculously expensive. I hope there's more inside the plastic box than just wires!Having said that, it's also ridiculously simple to install - provided you've already got the CD changer installed. Most importantly, is simply works. The iPod sounds much better using this over the FM transmitter I had been using for years.Note, get your CD's out of the changer first if you have any other use for them as you'll be removing power from the changer.Don't forget to disconnect the battery before plugging in the unit. Presumably it works best if it's already connected when the car is 're-booted'.If you hit any of the CD control buttons, the speakers will mute and you'll see Err in the display - then it falls back to radio. Not a big surprise considering there's no CD changer to answer the command. Just press the source button again to select the changer and your back in business."
1,HO HUM,"This phone was disappointing. I am packing it up to return it. I guess some of this has to do with the lag in the landline phones behind the cell phones. This phone is so slow to register your input that I end up repeating the number over and over. The redial only stores one number at a time. The ringer can only be set to off, low, high. The tone of the ringer is annoying. The base unit isn't easy to read as you sit, and when the hand set is in the cradle you can't read it either. It's really not easy to read when you walk by either. You have to be in just the right spot. I bought it on sale for $45 that is still too high."
3,Short but sweet,"While not the most extraordinary work Nabokov has written, I think the story was nice. There was a normalcy about Pnin that I liked. He wasn't an amazing hero, but he was a regular, quirky person. It is nice to read about someone like that, especially when the author is Nabokov."
2,What have you been smoking?,"After reading Lolita, I was anxious to read something else by Nabokov. Unfortunately, the most redeeming quality about Pnin is that it is short. After reading the comments by reviewers on the dust jacket (""Hilariously funny...""; ""fabulous laughter""; ""laughter that is near to tears""), I could only ask ""What have you been smoking?"" Ok, I did grin two or three times but laughter? Give me a break. Sure, the character did elicit sympathy and sadness but, otherwise, through most of the book I was thinking what a waste of paper. Read it if you want. Being as short as it is, you won't waste too much time."
3,Nothing Ever Happens,"Disappointing--Well written, of course, but uneventful. If Nabokov was trying to convey a quiet, uneventful sadness filled with ennui--he has succeeded almost too well! The book is as dull and unwitty as its subject(Pnin)although quietly likable--but not likable enough. Read ""Ada""--great fun."
2,Pnin is Pdull,"I loved Lolita, but I found this Nabokov story to be dull and pointless. I was very disappointed despite all the wonderful language he uses."
1,I can't believe these reviews!?,"Firstly, I've read virtually the entire works of Nabakov & consider him one of the greatest authors of all time. Secondly, Pnin is a terrible mistake. It is supposed to be comedic but is TOTALLY UNFUNNY, the eponymous character is dull and unbelievable, plotline almost invisible, the book as a whole is slow and awkward. Most of Nabakov's writing is as fresh and inspiring as a summer breeze but Pnin is like a bad case of halitosis. Forgive me, Vlad!"
1,"Fiction for people who like crosswords, not stories","As a Nabakov fan, I was appalled by this obscure and diffuse attempt at a ""novel."" The entire story is Pnin, a bumbling Russian professor, giving a series of rambling and often bizarre lectures on everything from the nature of being, love, and death to the finer points of Romanian cuisine. I've been told that these lectures hold the key to the story: copy the first and last words of each sentence and slowly the story within the ""story"" of Pnin begins to emerge. Brilliant intellectual fun for some but for those of us who prefer Nabakov's more conventional tales, Pnin is pretentious torture and a thorough bore. Consider yourself warned."
2,A slovenly jamboree,"This is a novel about a professor who is slightly cuckoo. This is a story about a man who is filled with opinions that can not only be considered conservative for our time, but did for his time as well. I used this novel to exercise my Nabokov, and is my least favorite novel by the author. I am glad he wrote others, because this alone would have stolen Nabokov's artistic genius.The book is written well, but the plot is immensely boring. I would suggest you NOT bother reading it."
1,Why do other people praise this?,"A friend recommended this when he saw me reading Lolita. I regret having bought it. It is one of the most boring, pointless books I've ever read. I find no more amusement in it than I would following around any elderly nerd, watching him fumble gracelessly through his boring life. And I feel it has absolutely no bearing on life as we know it today, and cannot appreciate or even locate social commentary or satire that other readers have found. In my opinion it should go out of print and stay there."
5,Poor Pnin,"This is one of Nabokov's most touching and most accessible novels, with the trickster, however, always present. Get it as soon as you can!"
5,A new favorite book,"This book took me a while to get into it - maybe 40 or 50 pages. Nabokov writes Augustine-style digressions, sometimes lasting for pages. He'll set up a five page description of a scene and end it with a metaphor. It took some time to become accustomed to it, but it did finally happen - and when it did, I fell in love with it.I didn't laugh as much as other reviewers have said they did, but there were indeed moments where my eyes watered. Pnin is really a tragic character and Nabokov did a fantastic job presenting him."
2,Too expensive,"I think Amazon kills its Kindle by so high pricing Kindle books - $12 - is the price of hardcover or at least paperback, not of the electronic version."
4,Good Writing CAN be Amusing.,Nabokov slips hints of poetry and inimitable descriptions into the story of a hilariously loveable college professor.
4,Long lasting battery but only one battery in each unit,"Have used for 2 yrs - They do work very well when placed in potted plants - shrubbery container - opened to rotate battery and have noticed that these in comparson to another set they have only place [metal connection] for one battery not two - Not sure if that would enhance the brightness or not. The Moonrays battery in them when purchased are very long lasting - now have ordered more Moonrays and a charger that charges the NiCd batteries required for these lights also -Bought a Duracell charger and that only does the NiMh. So Ordered this""Speedy Charger for Ni-CD or Ni-MH Batteries"" through Amazon"
3,Stake is Very flimsy,When I was taking the parts out of the box the stake that goes into the ground broke - yep just that flimsy. A piece sheared right off the main shaft. I could still use it but I had to be very careful. The light is not good for much except a path marker.
3,Useful but full of errors,"It's a good guide, and it doesn't give away the story. However, the maps section of the book isn't very well organised and there are a whole lot of errors in the book (from Ultima weapon having 1068HP to zillions of typos). Buy it only if you really can't play the game without the book."
1,A RIP OFF,"Don't buy thisThe buttons are cheap, and the voice is not clearWhen I tried the English words on several native English-speaking people, it was difficult for them as wellThe user interface is a little bit awkward and not very intuitive"
4,Nascar Thunder 2002,"Good game better than most Nascar Race games, (have all), set-ups still hard for some tracks,great racing action,great graphics. Must have!....."
3,not the best,"nascar 2002 has the best graphics but all playstaion nascar game are never realistic, the draft is so unreal u lose the ability to race side by side and there is only 18 cars aloud in a race, and the wrecks stink. the nascar games are always better on the pc. i have all the nascar games from 96-02 but they arent that great"
2,Too much money,"Love the IDEA of giving this to my daughter who was devastated that Nintendo Power was discontinuing. I backed out of the deal because after second thought, it was was too much money!"
5,Best wagon ever.,"I am thrilled with this purchase for our 2 y/o. He loves to go for rides in it alone or with a friend and plenty of leg room for both! When he's alone we flip down the other side for a table for him and what ever ""tweasuwes"" he finds. With the seat belts, I don't worry about him suddenly tumbling out, or standing up while moving. The cup holders are especially nice and fit a range of sizes. All in all a great deal.BUT! Be prepared to spend some time on assembly. Not difficult, just a little time consuming, but well worth it."
5,Twins love this wagon!,"My almost 2 year old twin boys love this wagon! They like to ride in it, push it, and pull it. And, we've even been able to squeeze 3 tots in it when their friends were so jealous of them! It is durable, pulls easily, and the perfect design for 2 toddlers!"
4,"Planes, Trains, and Wagons!","Have only owned this for am month but it seems to be quite durable and it does what it's suppose to do; place kid in wagon, pull kid around the neighborhood. So far, so good."
5,Great item with a great price,I bought this item for my godchild. They have told me that it's durable and safe. My godchild loves the wagon and I also purchased the umbrella with it.The umbrella is ideal for the beach. I would recommend this to anyone that has one or two children.
4,Justices Florida Wagon,"We had already purchased this wagon at walmart in NY and needed one for Florida. Could not locate one after searching 10 stores! Thanks to Amazon.com we had the exact product we wanted delivered to our doorstep for less than 10 dollars shipping!! It's a sturdy wagon, great for the beach, and will last forever!!"
5,Jeanne Tingwald,I think it was well built for a 2 year old child and will be good later at any age. Very happy
3,"Great Product- missing parts, assembly instructions TERRIBLE","We bought this product for our 16 month old and we also have one on the way, hence the two-seater. This was a Christmas present so we did not attempt to assemble it until Christmas Eve (bad decision in hindsight). We were missing a washer that is vital to the assembly of the wheels. The instructions only have pictures, and unfortunately, the pictures have not been updated with the same parts as the ones sent to us. It seems that it was arts and crafts time at the plant and the person responsible for making the drawings had never actually seen the product or attempted to assemble. The handle may have been the single most annoying and hard to put together item- my husband, not a small man, had to use every bit of his energy to push the handle into place.Overall, once the wagon was put together, it's great. My only gripe is the missing parts and terrible assembly instructions"
5,Childhood staple,A little different design from the one I remember growing up...this one has not only functionality but comfort. Given the choice my daughter always goes with the wagon over her stroller.
5,Tight squeeze in my trunk,"This seemed to be the most likely candidate to provide a comfortable ride while fitting in the trunk of my 2000 Mercury Sable (Ford Taurus). I wanted to provide this review to let others know how I got it in my trunk after my husband swore it wouldn't fit :) It went in wheels up with the handle extended and on the passenger side. I put the rear in first and slid the front down into the trunk with the handle extended. Then I pushed the handle down. I had to give it a good shove to get it past the trunk lid, but it fit. To remove, extend the handle first & then remove the wagon. I'm sure I will scuff the handle over time, but a pristine wagon does me no good sitting in my garage.It is very durable and sturdy. Assembly was easy. I bought the storage bag that hangs off the back & am happy with that as well. My son (almost 2) loves the wagon and is trying to convince the dog to go for rides as we speak."
5,Great product,Love this wagon for my little ones. We use it to go many places and it holds everything we need along with the kids.
4,Go to Target.com,The Pathfinder wagon can be bought at Target for much less. The ToysRus price is $79.99 and Target price is $45.00. Be careful; ToysRus is unwilling to match any price.
2,Hard to make turns,My wife and I really liked the idea of a wagon with seats and seat belts. It even comes with drink holders for their juice boxes. The kids fit in there perfectly and enjoyed being pulled around in it. The only problem is my wife and I hate pulling this thing. The wheels are the worst I've ever seen on a wagon. They don't turn in unison so you end up having to drag the wagon to the side you want it to turn to. We stopped using it altogether because it was such a pain to use. It has been sitting unused for months now. I would not recommend this wagon.
3,wagon wheels,I bought this wagon for my grandchildren and am so disappointed in the fact that the front wheels don't move right.They tend to turn in. It is so hard to pull and straighten out the wheels all the time. I would have returned it but didn't find out about the wheels until too late. If the wheels worked right this would be a great wagon. The wheels make all the diffence in the world on a wagon with two children in it.
5,Busy Mom with Twins!,"This wagon is absolutely perfect. Very easy to assemble. Very reasonably priced. My twins absolutely love riding in it. The ride is smooth, the cupholders are great, and steering the wagon is easy. It's so handy to take to the park because we can bring all the supplies and leave them in the wagon while the boys are running around. I can't wait to use this on Halloween - I think it will work perfectly. Great product!"
4,"A super wagon, especially for younger kids!",This is a great wagon! My title says it all! The seatbelts are super. My son was given this wagon for his 1st birthday. We took him out in it the next day. He enjoyed lounging around in it on our walk and I could relax knowing that he was safely belted in. Worth the bucks!
2,Don't believe the hype,This wagon is a great wagon until you actually pull it. The independent front wheels do not move in unison and awkwardly spin when trying to go any other direction besides straight forward. Most other quality wagons are design with the pull arm tied to the front axle which locks the wheels together and makes turns very smooth. If this were not a gift from the grandparents I would sell it immediately and buy a less expensive option.
3,disappearing seatbelt...,"We live in So. Cal. in mild weather, stored the wagon in the backyard where it did find some rain and sun, but after only ONE YEAR the seatbelts disintegrated/rotted and fell off. The wagon is still great and we trust that our almost 3 yr. old wont jump out but we can't trust that out 15 mo. old wont try so we wont be using the wagon until she is a bit older."
5,ProudMom,I purchased this wagon almost two years ago for my now 3 year old. She loved it then and she loves it now. For the past two years I have taken it to our local town annual celebration and my bestfriend and her daughter who is also three went with us both years. The girls rode in the wagon together which was very nice when they got to tired to walk. It comes with safety straps and four drink holders. I highly recommend this wagon for anyone who is considering to purchase one.
3,"Great for child, but you get a work-out pulling wagon up hills.","We got this wagon for Jack when he was 9 months old, we love it on walks through the neighborhood. He was able to look around and see more, he loves this wagon. It is very durable, and safe, no places on wagon that can scratch or cut him and no places that can rust as far as we can tell.My only complaint is the wagon is a beast to pull up our steep driveway, consider this if you are going be pulling up a lot of hills on you walks. Brad"
1,A Big Disappointment,"We had great expectations when we bought this wagon. One year later we are extremely disappointed. The ride is very rough and the front wheels wobble terribly whenever we try to move quickly. I called Radio Flyer about this problem and they sent two new front axles as a fix. However, because of the way the wheels are installed, it was not an easy fix and did not solve the problem. The wagon is hard to maneuver and gets 'stuck' going over curbs and cracks in the sidewalk. To add to this, my kids (age 2 & 4) are too big for the wagon! Their legs get all tangled up because the leg wells are too small. Finally, there is no extra storage, so when we go on outings I have nowhere to stow my bag, the lunchbag, etc. I have decided to cut my losses, sell this one to the consignment shop and get a Step 2 wagon with the little trailer attachment."
5,"A practical, durable wagon!","My daughter received this wagon as a present for her first birthday. The seatbelts are a great feature-I feel more secure knowing that she is safely strapped in. Also, I really like the rubber tires and the long handle that will tuck under the wagon for storing."
5,Very Fun Wagon,My daughter loves her red wagon. It was easy to put together and has been very durable. The handle folds underneath so it easily fits in the back of our Jeep. Beware that there are several 'models' of this wagon. Some have spots for a canopy or other options. This seems to be the base model. It has holes in the bottom for when kids spill their drinks. Great for taking to the zoo!
4,Great product and alternative to a double stroller,We purchased this for our one year old for Christmas as we were part of a nanny share and the wanted an alternative to a double stroller which can sometimes be bulky especially for those are side by side. The wagon was a great alternative as it was easy to pull and going through doors. It has cup holders for sippy cups and high backs so it provided plenty of support and also seat belts too. Definitely keep your eye in the amazon price as I have definitely seen it fluctuate greatly.My only complaint is that I wish that there was a locking system for the handle which can prove to be awkward to handle sometimes and thatbthere was a storage for the wagon. We have remedied the situation with a lunch bag attached around one of the seat backs.
3,Holding together so far.,"I really hate these ""hammer on"" metal fasteners that are used to hold the wheels on. I have no faith that they will hold up over time.Also, I think the company doesn't expect anyone to install the seatbelts:1. The ""seats"" will not stay folded down with the straps installed, because2. The holes drilled into the body to hold the straps are not in the right places. Rather than being on the sides of the wagon they are now located ""under"" the seats.3. The middle strap opening does not adjust, (as opposed to how it appears in the manual) which means you have to leave one side permanently threaded through the middle strap and awkwardly thread one of your child's legs into that side.A good thing about this wagon: it's cheap.Update 8/11: The thing has held together so far, I am giving a cautious upgrade to 3 stars. I still do not like the seatbelts at all so it's unlikely to go higher."
4,worth the money,"The wagon is well worth the money. I also purchased the canopy which works well to keep the sun directly off of the children. Used it last weekend at the zoo with my 9 month and 2-1/2 yr old grandchildren. The only thing that would make this wagon better would be a storage place for purse, diaper bags etc."
4,Great but no storage when kids are ridding,"I really love this wagon and so do my kids. The seatbelts are wonderful. The only thing is when the kids are ridding in it, there is no storage. They say there is in the adversiment but that's only when the seats are down in which case my 1 and 2 year old can not ride. I need a place to but my diaper bag and purse. Overall I love it and will probally use a backpack when im out with the kids..Radio Flyer please make something I can attach to te wagon for storage."
5,Well worth the money!,"We bought this wagon a few weeks ago for my 2 year old daughter and within a week it had earned it's keep! We took it to the zoo a few days after buying it and it was a lifesaver. There was plenty of room for my daughter and one of her friends and they both had their cups and snacks handy. When it came time for diaper changes and the bathrooms were full, we just folded down the seats and used it as a changing table. At lunch, she sat in one seat and folded down the other to use as a table. Perfect!I love that it has seatbelts so that she can't stand up when I'm not looking, and it has such a low center of gravity that there is no danger of tipping. The handle is long enough for my tall husband to pull comfortably and it steers beautifully.I bought this on sale for considerably less than the listed price here, but it is worth full price if you have to pay that."
1,Poorly designed/Poorly made,"We bought this plastic version for our kids with fond memories of the metal Radio Flyer of our own youths and have been sorely disappointed from the beginning. The seat belts didnt last a season as weather made them brittle. My 3 year old girl ripped them off by hand. The wheels cannot handle changes in direction (forward to backward) and the front wheels get stuck in a sideways position. They leave scuff marks on patio tile. All in all, this was a poor product and the last Radio Flyer product we'll ever buy -- they ruined an iconic toy."
2,Beware when wheels fall off,There are cheap plastic caps for the bolts attaching the wheels. The wagon is basically useless now because it snapped off. This after a year of only very occasional use.
5,"Large, but still alot of fun for 1 child!!!","Olivia recieved this as a gift for Christmas, she was 11 months old at the time... She loved it & still loves riding around in the wagon.. She loves to ride to the mailbox, or just ride around the cul-de-sac..either way, she loves it!! I would recommend this wagon to anyone!!!"
2,Poor Quality - DO NOT BUY,Our 14-month old has been on two rides in this wagon and the seatbelt strap has already broken. The front wheels are also very awkward at making turns and sometimes get hung in positions that make it difficult to pull.
4,go anywhere.....,This was great to send off to anyone you want to have a wagon no hassel.no worries about getting it home easy and excellent service in the mail..very reliable ..kids love it they ride together or bring along the pets to sit with fun......
4,easy to put together!,"This product was supper easy to put together! It was a christmas gift for my 6 year old son, he loves to pull his 5 year old brtoher and 3 year old sister around with this wagon. It is great watching them play nicely together! Great seat backs!"
4,Grandma's review,I have been buying Radio Flyer Wagons for many years. This is my 6th grandchild and the construction is as good or better than they were 45 years ago. The solid plastic will not rust. That was why I had to replace them periodically when my own 5 kids were growing up.
4,Great wagon,"I bought this from Amazon for my grandson. It was perfect. Easy to assemble, well priced, and he loves it. The fact that it is made of plastic was a plus because it will not rust."
4,nice wagon!!,"can't find much wrong with this wagon at all. Was fairly easy to assemble. Only downfall my husband pointed out was that you can't sit in it and use the handle to roll down a hill and steer it like we could in the ""old days!"". But I'm sure that's a safety feature. Seems to steer easily and takes turns well. The backrests are a real plus for little tykes. My granddaughter loved hers so bought the new grandson one for Christmas!"
5,Great purchase,This was a great Christmas gift for our 3 yr old granddaughter. She hauls her toys and puppy around in it all the time.
4,Grandkid fun,"Grandkids love this...they can be strapped in and enjoy the ride...easy to pull, but can be a little hard to turn when going up an incline...great to use instead of a stroller, especially when you have more than one child :)"
4,Useful and fun,"How durable is it? It's only seen a month's use so far, but it's holding up great. It's ""educational"" value? Depends on where you take it. It's good points are that you can haul more than one child at a time, or a child and pet. It's rather heavy so for a 3 year old, I value it more for transporting the child than for having the child transport anything. When she's older, maybe she will be able to pull it more easily."
5,Awesome!,"I got this wagon for my grandson's first birthday. I'm not sure who likes it best, his mom or him!"
5,Great wagon,We have had the wagon about 1 month and so far my 1 year old loves it. He enjoys riding around in it and hiding toys under the seats.
4,It ain't the same wagon!,This wagon sure has improved from the wagon I had 60 years ago - and is still in my garage! Could be a little easier to install the seat belts though!
4,Great gift for our granddaughter,"I purchased this wagon based on other reviews. It arrived in record time and was easy to remove from the box and easily assembled. It will be a Christmas gift for our granddaughter, and I think the nanny will love being able to take two 1 year olds for walks in it. It has fold up seats and sturdy seat belts with crotch straps, so little ones are secure. I cannot vouch for the product other than saying it looks awesome, and the UPS driver who delivered it was as excited as a child when he saw Radio Flyer on the box. The brand speaks for itself, as we had Radio Flyer wagons when we were kids. This one is plastic rather than metal, but that makes it lighter weight and easier to handle. The 4 star rating is simply because we have not actually used the product."
2,Wheels Don't Work Well,"We love the wagon, but the wheels on the front are poorly designed and don't work well. They constantly get stuck sideways and have to be re-set by hand to a forward position. Unlike the old Radio Flyer metal wagons, the handle doesn't steer the wheels. We do like the fold up seats and the seat belts. If we had to do it over again, we probably would not buy this product due to the wheel problems."
4,My kids love this,"My 16 month and 3 1/2 year old love going for rides in this thing. It's a very smooth ride. My only complaints are 1) on smooth services, the independent wheels often turn inward after a turn and don't straighten back out on their own requiring me to physically turn them back out (otherwise, you're dragging the wagon) and the 2) the interiod cup holders are useless as they are too small and shallow to hold any of my kid's sippy cups."
3,Great wagon - cheap wheels,"The Radio Flyer Pathfinder wagon has been purchased by me three times over the last 5 years for my grandchildren.The first two had real rubber, heavy-duty wheels. The last one had inferior plastic ones. Yes, there was a small dip in price but honestly, I'd rather pay more and get the quality."
5,Not the wagon I grew up with!,"I bought this wagon for our grandson for his birthday. It met all of our expectations and made him one happy little boy. My husband very easily put it together and was surprised at how sturdy it is. There's plenty of leg room for our little guy and a friend with the wagon having durable seat backs and seat belts. This wagon is a great example of how far children's ""toys"" have come and I know his mommy and daddy will enjoy pulling him in it when going to the parade and all!!!"
5,Great wagon,"I have a 3 1/2 year and a 1 year old. Both love to ride in this wagon. It is perfectly designed complete with cup-holders and seat-belts! I would recommend this wagon to everyone! Yesterday, I pulled them for two miles!"
4,My daughter loves this wagon,"One of the seats doesn't fold down snuggly like it should, that is why I gave it 4 stars.However, my daughter loves this wagon. It's been too cold to take it outside yet, but we've strapped her in and walked her around the house. When she is not in it, she puts all of her stuffed animals in it.Also a plus, the box said Made in the USA. That made me happy :)"
4,Solid Wagon,Purchased this wagon for a child at Christmas and have been pleased with its purchase and performance. Assembly instructions were easy to follow and would recommend being extra careful in mounting wheels. You must tap wheel caps on firmly but steady without breaking them. Turning is good and two 3 to 4 year olds can enjoy a fun ride. Safety is good with seat belts for each child and the handle can be folded underneath the wagon for storage. Cup holders were an extra for the kids if you want to take drinks on your excursions. Would recommend to parents and grandparents who need a safe way to transport the kids.
4,We have this wagon for our 3 and 1 yr olds,"and it is a great wagon, but there are two things that could be better about it. First of all, the handle could be longer. I'm tall, and it's a pain for me to pull for long distances. Secondly, the front wheels don't turn easily and tend to get hung up. Other than that, we use it when we go to the beach and take the kids out to the riverwalk parks. It does have seat belts which are nice, but it would be great if they had 3 or 5 point belts to hold the little ones in more secure."
5,our girlies love it!,"we have had this wagon for over six months now, and our two granddaughters still think it is the best toy in the house. they love going for rides in their wagon, and they always tell us to buckle them in. we just ordered the umbrella to shade them from the sun, so they will love it even more. of all the different brands and styles of wagons, this is by far the best we have ever seen."
4,Great Wagon! I have a great TIP for you!,"This wagon is awesome! The only problem I had with it though, is that the seats are hard and uncomfortable for little passengers. If you take the seat cover off of your baby swing, it fits perfectly into the wagon seat....even the seatbelt holes match up! I just ordered two matching swing covers from Graco. Now my baby can ride in and even doze off in his seat without hurting his back and head. Problem solved!"
5,We Love this Wagon,"We shopped around for a wagon, before buying this one. I wasn't sure I would like it, since it seemed so ""fancy"" compared to the one I had when I was a kid. My 12 month old daughter loves it. In fact, she took her nap in it in our living room, ate in it, and practiced climing into and out of it (while surpervised, of course!) for hours. I didn't think I would ever get her out of it.It is a smooth ride, easy to pull for miles, and I can pack three little kids into it. My daughter was a little scared to sit up on the higher seats, so we packed her into the bottom with blankets, and she loved it. Everyone that has tried ours out, went out and bought the same wagon."
4,Pathfinder Wagon,"This toy was eay to assemble and is a very good quality product. It has safety belts, which we didn't find with the other brands. We are very happy with this and know it will last us for years to come and will grow with our child (who just turned one)."
5,Favorite red wagon.,"My son got this for his first birthday, and just in time too. He was starting to not like being in his stroller for very long, especially if it wasn't moving. He loves his wagon. Has worked great for picnics and a day at the zoo. Much easier to manuever than a double stroller. I didn't have any trouble pulling it over bumps or grass. The seat belts and high backs are a must for little ones who haven't figured out how to hold on yet. Great for big kids too who can get in and out on their own. The cup holders are great for holding drinks and snacks. It is large enough for two kids and all of their gear. Yet I can easily get it in the trunk of my mid sized car. I also like it for when my son gets dirty or makes a mess with his snack. I can hose the wagon off, I would have a much harder time cleaning a stroller. I highly recommend this wagon."
4,wagon,"this is a very nice wagon, we were very happy with it. the seat lifts up and creates a back and the child could sit lower in the newly created seat. we were very satisfied with this wagon."
2,"Nice Wagon, Horrible Wheels","I have fond memories of barreling down a hill in my radio flier, wrecking it, and dragging it back up the hill to do it all over again. The wagon I had was the town and country and it has been used and abused. I am now 30 and my parents still use the wagon to haul stuff around it works great. I bought this wagon expecting the same great experience and was dissapointed. It seems very durable and I like the seats with the seatbelts (primarially the reason I bought it). My main complaint is with the front wheels. I understand that you cant steer it while sitting in the wagon but the wheels when I am pulling my son dont track straight & they just begin wobbling thus shaking the wagon. This is a major shortcoming in my opinion and is a significant design flaw (which earned this product the low rating). We will be getting one of the other wagons that have traditional wheels and axles and I would suggest that anyone reading this review do the same."
1,Big disappointment,"I ordered this item in hopes of using it for my boys' holiday pictures, but recieved the item with no screws or axles for the wheels...just the wagon bucket, handle and wheels. Big disappointment."
5,radio flyer,"perfect gift for my granddaughter and her Mom, seats are perfect for sightseeing and various functions.Great for whe you do not want to use stroller."
5,Great Wagon,We bought this wagon for my 1yr old daughter for Christmas. Like many parents I was up late the night before assembling presents. Even in a sleep deprived state this wagon was a breeze to assemble.We've taken it for one spin thus far and it seems sturdy and holds our daughter securely. If you are looking for a fun wagon for the kiddos and don't want to spend a fortune look no further!
4,Very Pleased,"Bought this wagon for 2 & 1 year old grandsons. Assembly fairly easy, grandma not very handy but did fine. Steering not a problem as others indicated. Most importantly grandsons like it very much and that pleases grandma."
5,Great toy for a busy mom with two little kids!,It is excellent for a busy mom. My two kids love it a lot and it saves me a lot of time. I just put them on for a walk. Everybody is happy!
4,harder to assemble than it should have been,"Just finished assembling this wagon...one month after I received it. Yes, I am the dad who can't read directions and while I didn't put the Left wheel on the Right side, I did put it on top of the wagon because I was being so careful not to get Left and Right confused. my bad. So please be careful when assembling. I was not happy with the connector of the wagon to the handle, it took me 25 minutes to get the rod through...it shouldn't have been that difficult...their bad. Anyway I think the kids are going to love this, and amazon does have good prices on it. But in retrospect I would've paid more to buy it already assembled elsewhere."
4,You can love a person only that is why I like it.,Great product! Easy to assemble and operate. My son enjoys the ride!!! Highly recommended. Plastic body makes it very long lasting.
5,fun wagon,"This was a gift, but it was a hit! It was easily assembled and the kids loved it! This is a great buy!"
3,Seatbelts not attached well,"My nephew bought this for his two little boys. Since both boys are very young (<18 mos), both need seatbelts when riding around in it. Within about two months of getting it, three of the four seatbelt straps had pulled away from the plastic and couldn't be put back. And it's also, as others have mentioned, rather hard to pull, especially with two children in it. If the seatbelts aren't needed, it's not a bad toy, but if they're important to you, try something else."
1,Two Bad Wagons,"I've owned two of these wagons over the span of 18 months. In each case, the wagon's wheel and axle proved defective. Despite the legendary name, I would consider a different brand or product."
4,granpa gift,A neat wagon for small kids--features and quality great for young children 1-4. My grandson loved it
3,nice wagon. some issues,I like this wagon. It was easy to asssemble. IT DOES NOT HAVE RUBBER WHEELS. RADIO FLYER DOES NOT MAKE THE SOLID RUBBER WHEELS AS OF 2008. This is directly from Radio Flyer. Shipping from Orange took almost two weeks and there customer service is very slow via e-mail. No live service. There is no shock absorbtion in this wagon. I would cosider get the ATW next time. I love the seats and seat-belts. The handle does not swivle which feels a bit strange at first. I paid $90 with shipping. You can do better.
5,Great for restless Toddlers!!,"I had bought the Radio Flyer ATW Wagon (Nice Wagon too) for my daughter, now 5.My youngest son is 15 months, Well, it was OK for her, but he would NOT sit still in the wagon and wanted to stand ALL thetime, so neither one us was enjoying it, we had to stop every 5 seconds to sit him down. My daughter wasn't too happy either.So, Got online and found this, GREAT IDEA!! Seatbelts!!FINALLY we can put our youngest 2 in and they have a great time!Perfect for trips to the Zoo! No more worry about him falling out or standing up in the middle of a ride! And yes the handle is great, just takes a bit getting used to it not free moving like the other one we had, but great stearing overall.THANK YOU!"
5,love the wagon,"We haven't taken our 15 mth. old outside in this yet, but she loves to be pulled in it around the playroom. Love the seatbelts."
3,Assembly,My daughter recieved this toy for Christmas. Has anyone else had trouble lining up the holes for the handle pin? I have been trying to fit the pin through and the holes are about 1/4 inch off and will not allow the pin to go all the way through. I thought about drilling a new hole but didn't want to harm the handle. Has anyone else had issues with this? Any suggestions?
3,"Good wagon, but not best!","As soon as we assembled the wagon, the plastic bolt for attaching the sealbelt broke, so we couldn't use it until we received the replacement. Radio Flyer sent it within 3 weeks from of charge and then we were able to enjoy the wagon. In retrospect, we should've paid extra for the other models that have opening doors and other upgrades."
3,Good Wagon But HUGE,"I have had this wagon for about 4 years now and it has gotten minimal use. I bought it for the seat belts and the cup holder was a nice bonus. I hate how huge it is. It is a real pain to navigate with a child in it and my daughter has always been tiny. She's 6 now and weighs only 39 lbs. It has been in our garage forever. It still works and looks great but I always hated taking it out. I would only use it when my husband came along to pull or push it. We used it no more than 10 times and I wish I would've gotten something smaller. If you don't have 2 kids, stick with a smaller wagon."
2,"Hard to pull, hard to turn","This wagon will give you a workout when pulled, the wheels don't cooperate, and it will tip when you turn if you don't watch because the wheels turn inwards. Maybe its the the thiness of the wheels, but I constantly have to kick them outwards to get the wagon to move, big frustrations when you don't the room to move it or you're trying to navigate it around people. Its bulky, I know its a big wagon-its supposed to have some heft but even with 1 toddler its a load to pull around. I have trouble even on a smooth surface with lots of room, and anything else, like even compact gravel, dirt, or grass is a nightmare. This isn't a wagon I recommend."
3,Durable but I don't like the handle.,"The wagon is great, but I am not in love with the ""no pinch"" handle. It just doesn't turn that great. Maybe I'm old school , but I like having the front wheels pivot with the handle and have never had a problem with ""pinching"". Other than that, it's very sturdy."
5,Great wagon!,"Love this wagon! My twins were able to sit in it at just 10 months because of the back support and seatbelts. We also fold those seats down and use it to carry all our ""Stuff"" to the beach."
2,not good quality,"Cheap plastic, not very durable. Older models are a lot better quality. If I knew the quality of the item, I would of bought another brand."
4,Pathfinder Wagon,"We have found this product to be durable and loads of fun. My granddaughter received this as a gift and at first she was really unsure of it. Left alone, we soon found her sitting in her wagon surrounded with Easter Eggs and stuffed animals. She loves to sit in the wagon and watch her Dora DVD's. We have taken her for walks and she loves them. This coming school year she will be attending the neighborhood school, it is too far to walk for her, but the wagon will be perfect."
4,We Love this wagon,"Worth the price paid. My 2 year old and 10month old really enjoy riding this wagon. The first times they sat in it, they just laughed and laughed at each other! Now the 2 year old likes to ride but she also likes to pull her brother around. It's easy to pull (on a flat surface) even a 2 year old can do it. I'm sure we'll get lots of use with this wagon unlike many toys you buy for kids that they play with only a handful of times.Love the fact that it comes with seatbelts. Like all the other features too. Got so many compliments on it .(...)"
1,not a good purchase,"We ordered this wagon for our granddaughters 1st b-day and had it delivered to there house,to our surprise all the wheels,axel and seat belts were missing. Very disappointed as this was 2 days before her b-day and now no present,will be very skeptical in ordering from Amazon again."
2,Kiddie Whale Pool,"I can not rate this item correctly since I returned it. It was not as described. I was told that the kiddie pool that was pictured was discontinued so I was sent a different version, very similar but still different. The customer service was good and I returned the pool."
3,"Does the Job, but...","The only reason I ordered this is because the original unit broke during an electrical storm. That being said, this dimmer works, but whenever there is an electrical storm, the dimmer activates without the lamp being touched (a rather annoying occurrence). But for the price, it could have worse glitches."
1,stopped working in 1 week,I replaced a similar Westeck device that had worked for years. This one blew out in less than a week.
1,Would not recommend this item!,"When I first plugged it in it seemed to work well; however, after a day or so it began doing all sorts of crazy things. It would turn on or off when I closed a near-by door or if I opened or closed a drawer on the chest where it sat. I went to bed one night with all lights off and woke the next morning with the lamp blazing. I could not make it go off until I unplugged it. I then tried it on another lamp with the same results and once more on the original lamp - same thing. Have since returned to Amazon and received a credit. You can always rely on Amazon to do the right thing!"
1,lamp dimmer,product did not work as advertized. it didn't work all some time. when it worked you had to hit the lamp so hard that it hurt your hand.
1,dumb,"it worked for about 3 weeks but now only recycles off, dim, bright constantly, don't waste your money, it is a good idea if it worked"
4,one-touch lamp dimmer,"I ordered this because I already own a couple and they are handy especially for my husband who has trouble turning on lamps. The only problem is that when it thunders outside, the vibration turns on the lamps during the night so we have to get up to turn them off, and it may happen again ."
2,plug-in dimmer,one works good and then one doesn't to good. i have bought some from another maker that work great on all types of lamps.
1,Save your money,"Shipped to me right away, but it's almost worthless. It does dim the lamp plugged into it, but it also changes brightness when the phone rings, and it often changes the lamp for no apparent reason. Go to bed with the light off...them POW! Light comes on at 2am. It's cheap enough, but you get what you pay for. Spend another $10 and buy a better unit."
1,Should have read the reviews first,I bought four of these and while they were installed it was like living in the haunted mansion! Lights turning on and off by themselves!!
1,Plastic Trash that Doesn't Work and Blew a Bulb,"I found these on clearance at Target. Now I know why.This piece of trash would only turn on the lamp next to bed to the lowest setting. It would not turn off my lamp, nor would it allow the bulb to burn any brighter.So, I tried it with my desk lamp with one of the expensive Reveal bulbs I need for work. It shot that one immediately when I tapped the lamp. (The bulb was completely cool and hadn't been on for almost 24 hours; so the tapping couldn't have shot the bulb.)So, I'll be returning these and complaining to the company that they owe me a new Reveal bulb. Want to take bets on if I get one from them?Update May 8, 2011: Westek has not even acknowledged my request. That should tell you what kind of company it is."
1,Mine didn't work,"I plan to try to return the ""touch dimmer"". I couldn't get it to do anything on my lamps. I tried it on several of them. Would have been cool if it had worked, but alas... - Stagehand Jim"
2,Substitute/Mislabeled?,"Ordered this product but received what was evidentily a substitute. Received an ""Amertac"" brand version instead. The substitue worked as advertised but is way more bulky then the original order. Does not allow, (the substitute), for other devices to be utilized in the same receptacle."
4,Touch Lamp Dimmer,Works great with any lamp I have used it with. These usually last a few years and then quit working. I have used one like this for 8 or more years. My wife has arthritic hands and it is a life saver for her. Actually I like them to.Only downside is they usually wear out around the 3 year mark in my experience. I will continue using them.
3,seriously flawed,Its a great idea ...BUT ...the light goes on and off by itself ...I have to turn the light off at night in order to prevent it from turning itself back on in the middle of the night. This gadget needs some considerable work in order for it to be truly useful. Take a pass on this and get a sliding dimmer.
4,GREAT,this game has many great activities. it is just like the movie! it is also way better than the computer game that has less things on it. i really recommend this item. you should buy it.
3,harry potter and the sorcerer's stone,In this game you play young Harry and you are set surtan tasks do do on your way to lesons some are very easy others ant so like at the bank collecting you money is hard and fast but you all so are on the same story line as the film !
4,"Requires some ""Fast Fingers""","This game is great but I would rent if before you buy it! I bought it quite a while ago and I still haven't gotten past the broom flying part. (It's not as easy as it looks) I hate being timed,because I don't have really fast fingers! It was fun up till that point, now it just sits in the corner of my room collecting dust. Once in a while I drag it out, start a new game, and play till that point then I just put it back in the case and back in the corner it goes, until I figure out how to beat that part, it will stay there. Sorry Potter but I just have to dock a star, on this one :("
4,Awesome but it could be a little more like the book...,This is a cool game and all but its way to short and its hardly like the book or the movie... It is a cool game...especially quidditch!
4,I'm having a lot of fun...,"I got this game for Christmas, but I didn't pick it up until a few weekends ago. Since then, I've been hooked. Though I'm only about 54% of the way done at the moment (and stuck), I'm still having fun. I have recently been finishing my homework earlier than usual so that I can have a few minutes on the PS2. I'm a fairly new gamer, so I am finding much of the game to be a challenge, though more advanced users may find it easy and boring. I would reccomend it to everyone!"
2,Missing the Magic,"This game has good graphics, but lacks sufficient challenges. Furthermore, the game lacked options for exploring the many levels it has to offer. For example, if you were unable or unwilling to finish a challenge, the game gave no option of moving to an alternative level until you could come back to the other. Very flat scenario."
4,Fun and Challenging,"I like the puzzles that have to be solved in this game. They are challenging without being so hard that they can't be solved by humans. Some of the skill tests are quite difficult (like the trip into Gringott's) but children and adults alike will enjoy the action. I would have appreciated a bit better graphics on some of the people but other than that, this is a very fun and engaging game for all ages."
4,Be Harry Potter...,I got Ps1 for my 10th birthday and I got Harry Potter and theSorcer`s Stone as my first game. It is realy fun and challenging.It will be great the WHOLE family!
3,"NOT TERRIBLE, BUT NOT VERY GOOD","For one thing, I will say this game's not too awful but there are a number of problems that need to be addressed. For one, missions aren't very exciting, and they almost feel like fetch-quests like you see in RPGs. When it comes to broom riding the controls are awful, and I failed broom test flights numerous times because of the controls, and you have to repeat the course every time you fail. So, because of this I found myself yelling constant obscentities. The graphics are awful (Come on ! Consoles in this time period had better capabilities than this !), and the character voices sound terrible. This game feels like it tries to imitate RPGs too much, and falls flat on its face in the process. The game doesn't take much to complete either (I completed 29% of the game in just over an hour). With that said, this game doesn't suck, but it's not very deep or exciting either."
2,Um....,"I really hoped that the PlayStation game would be a great one. After I saw the movie, I decided to buy the game, cuz it sounded neat. Well...the game is a bit disappointing. I expected much more than Harry running around, trying not to be late for class, casting spells, etc. But that's practically ALL that he does. The beginning of the game was interesting, but then you start trying to collect beans, run... errands, blah-blah-blah. Even thought I LOVE platform/adventure games, this didn't work out for me. I got to 60 something % and just quit. It was a bit challenging after the beginning, but then it just got WAY to easy and short, so I dropped this game and choose Ape Escape. Now, Ape Escape is a WAY better game than Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, so if you want a great platform game, choose APE ESCAPE! And the Harry Potter movie was better than the game, so either just watch the movie or rent it, DON'T BUY IT!"
2,Alittle on the short side...,"This game is one of the best ive ever played. But, its too short. I beat it in 3 hours without trying. Also, there isnt much walkthrough or a map so u dont know where ur going. Dont get me wrong, this is the BEST game ive ever played, buts its easy. ON the BAD side, you cant pass the cut scenes. The Cut scene on the last level is 5 minutes long. And u have to see it EVERYtime u challenge valdamore (i dont read the harry potter books, so i dont know wats his name)Luckily, i only needed 3 chances to beat him. He is VERY hard but not frustrating, just challenging. I heard that Harry potter and the chamber or secrets is coming out, i hope that its the same great graphics and everything, just alittle harder. Anyways, RENT IT BEFORE U BUY.IF U GET TO THE LEVEL WHERE U MEET HAGRID, THEN UR ABOUT HALF WAY DONE. IF U GOT THERE IN LESS THEN AN HOUR AND A HALF, THEN DONT COSIDER BUYING THIS GAME CUASE ITS TOO EASY.DONT GET ME WRONG, ITS THE BEST GAME, JUST TOO EASY."
3,Missing the magic,"The finer points of this game may wasted on a muggle like myself. The poor camera angles, and the lethargy of the camera movment leave a lot to be desired. You can not save when you want to. You have no choice as to when you must do certain tasks or puzzles. You can not go back to pick up things you missed along the way. The lack of being able to explore at will, and being locked into areas once you have entered them is more than just frustrating. Do not even attempt to fight Voldemort if you are not ready for the game to be over. You can not win the fight and then go back to reach the 100% mark. Win the fight, the game takes over, and that's it. Over all, once you get the hang of moving, and especially flying, you can have some fun. I can't say that I am sorry I purchased this game, but if I had rented it first, I probably would not have bought it."
1,installation problems,"I had installation problems on two different computers. After 3 attempts, it finally worked on computer #1 -- and I have no idea why it finally worked. I still haven't gotten it to work on computer #2. Both computers met/exceeded the system requirements. Disappointed to say the least."
3,You have to really like Harry to like this game.,"I bought this game simply because it was Harry Potter and I'm a fan. I didn't expect too much from it, and you shouldn't, either. Harry's no Lara Croft, and this game is no Tomb Raider. There are some fun and amusing episodes, but there are also some that are difficult or frustrating, with no way to opt out and come back later. I'm hardly a connoisseur of video games, and I don't have much with which to compare this game. Honestly, I think it would be fun for kids who really like Harry Potter and aren't easily frustrated -- I'm sure that's who it was designed for, anyway. As for me, I'll stick with Lara and the Danger Girls."
5,amazing! If you can't beat the flying lesson you stink!,It took me 5 days to beat it. And it was realy fun! except for the bank it took me 1 hour to beat it! And Killing Quiral is hard! The rest is fun! Don't buy it rent it!
5,Amy and Bobbys Review,Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone video game is a very exciting and adventurous game. As soon as we got it we played for 2.5 hours straight. The graphics are really good and it only takes 2 seconds to load. It is also a challenging game though fun at the same time. We recommend this game to all Harry Potter fans!
1,Worst Game ever,"There are so many problems with this game. First of all, how about letting us save the game while were fighting the Dog, plant, keys,chessboard,Troll, knights, or Voldemort. Not to mention the game keeps freezing. So even if you spend the four hours trying to get past Voldemort your game will probably freeze and you'll have to start back at the dog. Horrible Game."
3,Fun Game - Even After You've Forgotten It Exists,"I first bought this game in 2001, as a reward for a good grade on a standardized test. I used to have so much trouble with this game, so I gave up on it, and hid it in the depths of my closet for years.Recently I brought it out again, shortly before the release of the final Harry Potter movie. It was much easier playing the game as a 19 year old, as opposed to playing it as a 9 year old. The graphics are laughable compared to today's graphics in video games, and I still got stuck on sections of the game, but it was a very nostalgic experience for me to play it again.This game is fun, but it is also challenging. I enjoy it, despite the terrible graphics. It's like a blast from the past, and it makes me smile when I play it. That said, unless you're a person who grew up with Harry Potter, you may not enjoy it. It's more of a nostalgia thing than a fun thing."
2,Fun until the flying lesson,"This game is fun until you get to the flying lesson.Hootch'sconstant ""Concentrate,potter,and try again'make you want togo over and strangle her.Going through all those hoops makesyou feel like you're a trained animal going through endlesshoops to entertain Hootch.Flying through 20 hoops was annoyingenough,but having to fly through 40 hoops?Come on now-fortyhoops?It gets boring having to keep flying through hoops constantly,and it's a waste of time.If you have this game and cannot get past the flying lesson,I suggest you put ituntil Game Shark Video Game Enhancer comes out with codesfor this game."
2,"The crazy, aggravating, playstation game!!!!!!!","In this game the people look like a cross between dead moles, and squirrels.(especially Dumbledore.) In quidditch it's not good! you go way too slow , and have to fly through dumb rings. Fluffy looks like a big blob of chocolate. in the corrider it's stupid! Filch just sits there yelling his head off hoping someone will hear him, when nobody but you him and his cat are there! The only thing he says is ""Intruder, Intruder in the forbidden corrider!"" or ""Oh, we are in trouble now aren't we?!"" You can only wear the invisibility cloak for five seconds! I mean in the game you don't even have fingers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Get it NOW!,"I, like many parents, have been waiting for this game! It's here and it's GREAT! It doesn't disappoint. Great graphics and voices, although the faces of the characters are kind of weird. I bought this as an early birthday present for my daughter and we're already fighting over it! You get to start practicing riding a broom within the first 5 minutes of game play (flying through hoops; reminding me of Spyro). Another plus for parents: it's got great music....nothing ""irritating""! A definite MUST for Christmas!"
1,EA's attempt at a quick buck,"This game stains all that is Harry Potter. The gameplay is annoying and doesn't set a mood. It is to easy and not interesting. Even quidditch is boring. What I really wish for is a game with some thought to it. I would really them to make Harry Potter Quidditch. I really like the idea of quidditch and if they put the sport into a game and add some real thought to it, it might be a best seller"
3,Harry Potter,If you didn't read the first book then don't get this game. I finished this game really fast. The hardest part in the game is probably the galleon vault in Gringotts. You'd be surprised how easy You-Know-Who is. .
2,Harry potter ps1,"Can't beat the price for this game, game play is very simple and is such a short game with more than bad graphics, but it is ps1 can't expect alot. The game does not follow the movie very well but a good pickup for a cheap price if you like harry potter."
3,OK for the Kiddies,"I recieved this game about four days ago. I opened the package and began playing it for about three hours. After that time I was about 40% done with the game. The next day, I played a total of three hours, and I was about 75% done. On the third day I played about two hours and completed it. Do you catch my drift?Now, I would classify myself as a very experienced gamer and have played a number of very difficult games. I would classify this as the easiest game I have ever played on the Playstation console(next to Ridge Racer). I will give it credit, however, the castle and the surrounding area was very well designed, the interactions with other characters is very good, and the levels are fun and interesting.If you parents are looking for a good game for your 7-12 year old, I would suggest this game. If you are looking to buy for 13+, I would continue my search elsewhere. Overall, this was a very fun and interesting game, but it wasn't very challenging."
4,Quite fun!,This is a fun game but sometimes if you just want to explore you have to go and do a quest. Some parts are quite hard like when you are doing the quest for Snape.It would be better if you could have some more help in the manuel. I would tell my friends to get this game though. You can't do what you want to do.It would be better if you started at Diagon Alley because I would like to go to Gringotts.
2,Where Are the Graphics?,"I was really disappointed in this game. After having read all of the books and seeing the promos for the movie, I expected more from the graphics of this game, even if it was original Playstation vs. Playstation 2. The graphics in the game portions were, I thought, poorly done. After Tombraider showed us what Playstation graphics could be, this was a deep disappointment.If you're expecting great graphics and visually interesting environments, look elsewhere. Perhaps the PC game is better. I can only say that I'm very glad I rented this before buying. Felt I saved myself a great deal of money."
5,Great fun for kids and tweens,"My daughter had a digging set similar to this one last year (she was 11) and it took her MONTHS to find everything. (That was an Egyptian dig) This one was made with different materials, and was much easier to get into. It comes with metal tools instead of plastic, which is great. A kid can dig through this carefully in an hour, or two boys can completely destroy it in 10 minutes. (My son preferred it that way) The cleanup was also quicker as this set is made of fine gravel instead of clay-type sand that stains fingers. Both of my kids really enjoyed it using their different methods. I think this set is best for younger kids (not teenagers) and can be a lot of fun. If you want something more difficult, look for that Eqyptian dig I mentioned."
5,LET THE HUNTING BEGIN,"I have recently just bought this new PS2 game, and im completly satisfyied. This game is a whole lot of fun... and at the same time very exciting. The single player mode is definatly the highlight of the game. You go to varous parts of the world. And complete a searies of tasks. Some challenging others a piece of cake.The game is addicting and fun. This game is definatly a step up from your average car racing game! Go out and buy. You will be glad u did!"
5,godofspy,This is definantly a must have for the PS2. This classic arcade game has came through with a great sequal. There is no game like spy hunter out there. The level design is amazing and the locations are great. The missions are objective based and are very fast paced action packed fun. This sequal shares alot of the great things that were in the original but is fine tuned in 3D and funner than ever.
4,Very enjoyable...,"Hey all, this has turned out to be a very enjoyable game. I remember playing this when it was at the arcade and it definitely is better than the arcade version. Very nice graphics, smooth gameplay and controls and just overall a good gaming experience."
4,Pretty good,"This game is good in every way eccept for a couple. What's up with the story line??????, pretty out of this world! And 2 player mode!, I won't botther to say."
1,Not a good game at all!,"I really hated this game for many reasons. Here are some pros and cons:Pros:- uhhhhhh... (i guess the graphics are ok)Cons:- No freedom. There is a track you have to follow, but you have to do missions and kill people along the way. Doesn't really make sense.- No weapons. For a game with no freedom, like this one, you would think they would try to spice it up with some cool weapons or something. Nope. All you have is a machine gun and a regular gun.- I don't get why your car turns into a motorcycle when your life is low.- Controls are too complicated. While you are going really fast and trying to complete missions, you have to add more confusion switching your weapons. You would think only having two weapons, it would be easy to switch, but no.This game really doesn't deserve to be a Playstation Greatest Hit. Sorry if I offended any SpyHunter fans."
5,Spyhunter rocks,"This one of the best PS2 games ever!! Good graphics and storyline, could be better if it had more levels, but that's the only downside. I've just read a review of one star for this saying ""you only get one gun"" who ever wrote it apparently only played through the training mission, since after that you get upgrades on the gun (10mm to 25mm to 50mm), missles (start with unguided, then guided, and swarm(four at once)), emp(electromagnetic charge-don't get it either, unguided and guided), and rail gun (really powerful and cool laser thing, guided only), and for defensive you've got oil,smoke, and flamethrower to protect your tail end. The extras are a great bonus compared to spyhunter2 which didn't have hardly any and the ruined the spyhunter theme by saliva (see my review for spyhunter2, ""12 year old gamer from Hays KS, USA. Anyone who considers themeselves a serious ""game king"" must beat this before rightfully proclaiming it, I've beat it 3 times in the past weak."
3,"good,sorta","This game is pretty good, good graphics, good control, but its gets really boring really fast. The missions are repetitive and the objectives are boring as hell. Also the controls are sometimes swervy and youll be gettin shot by guys when your stuck in a corner. Renting this is a good idea but bying it is not."
2,BORING!!!!!! BORING!!!!!! BORING!!!!!!,"This was my first game for PS2. First this was good but after the fourth level it startded to get real boring. If you want to buy this game, RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Tons O' Fun,Yup; it's better and much more fast paced than the origional 1983 game. I couldn't put this baby down for the first 2 hours and now it's all I think about. Excellent!
2,man don' buy this game,when i bought this game i thought it would be like smugger run but all it is racing and blowing up stuff u can't even explore the area your in and the wepons r cool but it so dame hard to beat the game took my 2 days to beat the first level because u have to compelet a buch of task that r preet hard the grapic r good ONLY BUY THIS GAME IF U LIKE VERY VERY HARD GAMES!!
2,Tedious,Game become annoying when you must continue running same missions over and over to get enough points to continue.Not worth the [amt]. Maybe [amt].
1,Horrible and Agonizing Gameplay,"Absolutely the worst racing game I have ever played. Takes forever to load and has extremely difficult and frustrating gameplay. Just NOT fun. Rented it for 5 days and returned it on the first day after 2 hours. The original SpyHunter was great fun to play, they should just rerelease the original and put this drink coaster in a waste bin where it belongs. Did I mention it was NOT fun at all? Go out and buy the original f-zero for the super nes, or F-zero X for the N64, or even Rumble Racing with cheesy graphics but fantastic gameplay for the PS2 which is a million billion zillion times better than this current incarnation of Spy Hunter."
2,Good for a rental. Not worth $50,This game is very short you can finish it in a few hours. One player missions are fun but two player is flat out boring...Enjoyed it for 8 hours...Found my self thinking that they developed a few levels then quit before they had a full blown game. ... you should get at least 5-7 days of play time instead of 5-7 hours.
1,Being re-released on XBOX,"This game is being re-released on XBOX with better graphics. If you are planning on picking up XBOX, I'd definitely hold off on this purchase. As for the game itself, it is quite good, remaining true to the original theme of Spy Hunter, while adding a 3D element. Well done."
1,BORING,"If you havent noticed my title for this reveiw, Spy Hunter for the Playstation 2 is very, very, very BORING!!! Drive car, shoot things, change into boat, drive, shoot more things etc etc. As you can see, Spy Hunter is very bland and very, very, very boring. With no story, no action, and god awful controls,I rank Spy Hunter as one of the worst games ever made.I recomend that you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
2,"Fun but short, could have been much better","Sure, the game is fun but it doesn't take very long to beat it.Its a great rental but if you thinkin bout buyin it,dont because its a waste of money. It took me about five actual hours of playing to beat the game and get most of the extras (cheats and vidios) i EXPECTED MUCH MORE FROM A PS2 GAME, BUT MANY OF THE PS2 GAMES IVE TRIED ARE TOO EASY OR SHORT OR JUST STUPID."
5,Spy Hunter - Amazing upgrade of old game!!,"Just got this game yesterday... I loved the arcade game Spy Hunter when I was a kid, I spent many quarters playing it...When I heard that they were gonna give it the PS2 treatment, I was thrilled...Altho a little bit skeptical that they werent going to make true to the original...I neednt have worried...This game has captured the feel of the original game with the plot and gameplay.. AND it has some of the most awesome graphics I have ever seen in a videogame.. This game is a cross between Gran Turismo 3 (which I hate, but i think the graphics are awesome) and the original Spy Hunter...Controls are excellent, movie sequences make sense, and missions are manageable (not too easy, not too difficult (like Twisted Metal for PS2 - Sheesh!))Awesome remake of an awesome game!"
5,Get this bad boy now!!,"Man, where to begin?? First, let's talk graphics. Everything about this game looks fantastic. The cars, the cities, the roads, the boats, water etc.. SMOOTH. Seriously, imagine Twisted Metal Black, only with a plot and objectives. The transformation of the car is great, feels like you're James Bond. The sound... awesome. The title music you'll instantly recognize. I really can't find one thing I don't like about this game. It's fast, and with a LOT of hidden routes to let you explore. One second you'll be in the boat, next you're hopping on the sidewalk in Venice running down people. This game is for racing and action fans alike. I can't recommend this game enough. I loved the first Spy Hunter in the 80's, but this one blows it away. Finally, a game that's not too hard, but not too easy either. Get it now!!"
5,AWESOME simply put.....,"I Just played the demo of this game. It is included with the October Issue of Playstation magazine (at newstands)so dont just take my word for it, go and get it! It was great! The graphics are excellent with great firey explosions etc.! Game play and controls are fairly easy to learn. The AI can be tough but hey if it was too easy it would be boring! If you are into the car racing type of games or are an old arcade Spyhunter player and want a new twist then this is the game for you! CHECK IT OUT!"
2,and I'm a fan!,"I loved two of the author's books: Bird by Bird, and the Journal of Her Son's First Year. In addition, I read her Salon articles. However, I could barely get through this book. I thought it was very self-indulgent, and Rosie is kind of an ordinary little kid but everyone keeps referring to how great she is. She's only 8 years old anyway-- not an appropriate age to hold my interest as a major character. This book made me think the author was basing the child on herself because there was so much emphasis on how wonderful the kid was. The good parts of the book involved Elizabeth and Rae going on a hike--I actually felt drawn into the story at that point. It passed. If you read this book and don't like it, keep trying. I found the author's non-fiction works to be everything her fiction wasn't here."
3,okay,This book had a lot wrong with it but it still pulled me into it and I ended up staying up late to finish it so it had a lot right with it too. Basically Lamott has great character insight and can keep a story rolling. The main character is recently widowed and raising a young girl (Rosie) alone. We are privileged to know of all her failings and neurosis which are amazingly easy to identify with.
5,The best book I read all year.,"I read Crooked Little Heart first and loved it. I then read Rosie and was hooked. I immediately lent them to my l8 year old daughter, who passed it down to her l5 year old sister. Both of them absolutely loved these books and we're all hoping for a third in the series. Please write one, Ms. Lamott!"
2,expected more,"Cutesy and pedantic, clunky and dull. I just had no interest in Elizabeth The Drunk, and wondered what all these male admirers saw in her, given that she did nothing, was paranoid and boring and always drunk. LaMott seems to have lots of fans, but this is just plain bad writing."
2,I'll give Anne Lamott a second chance...,"""Rosie"" had potential for being a great read. While I found the story line to be interesting, the filthy language and drug scenes were very distracting. How disturbing to think that someone would write a seemingly personal account of a mother-daughter relationship and think that her audience would accept this story as typical parenting. Even though many may be able to relate to the destructive affects of alcoholism and drugs in family relationships, I found ""Rosie"" to be a sad and disturbing story of covert emotional abuse. I would have accepted the theme if ""Rosie"" had been labeled an autobiography (was it?) but I found little value in it as a work of fiction. It should have come with a warning label."
4,Good history but confusing at times,"The actual idea behind the book is pretty good and is very interesting. The problem is that characters lack certain personality and the just have one or two emotions, also the science parts maybe quite confusing for some (especially me because i'm from Mexico) but still you'll probably be able to understand the most part. You'll probably like this book but it's not an action book and progresses kind of slow in some parts but still it's quite a fun book because of the theories and things like the shared reality.Another thing is that you should probably read Probablity Moon before but it isn't a necesity to understand this book ( I read this one before not realising it was a triology)"
1,l'Hoyer deserves better,"I am not fond of the performances. Aside from an unfocused recorded sound, I found the tempos to be too 'rushy' - technically, the playing is sloppy with very little attention to detail. There is a certain sweep to this kind of diffuse playing and interpretation, but details in the music are, to my mind, lost or not apparent. The Stenstadvold recording is greatly superior; this fine chamber music requires a balance of performance pratice awareness with technical finesse and accuracy."
4,A case where the movie was as good as the book,"After watching the rather splendid movie adaptation from this book (renamed hope springs), I decided to purchase this vocal book. The premise for this book is around an English character who, after breaking up with his partner back in England, travels to a small US town where he falls in love, only to have he's ex partner come back into their lives. Although this book can be dialog driven at times it is still an easy fast flowing book that, as long as you are not looking for any great meaning, should enjoy."
1,Absolutely unengaging,"To be frank, I am baffled by the praise this book has received. I was ""forced"" to read it for a book club and found it to be completely unenagaging. When one runs across a book written in such simple language the reaction is to find within the lines some deeper/hidden meaning. Unfortunately this was not the case with ""New Cardiff"". A third grader could comprehend the complexities laid out on the pages. A quick read is one thing that can be memorbale for many reasons (try Joyce Carol Oates ""Beasts""), but Webb's attempts in New Cardiff are simply forgettable. If you choose to take a stab at this one, please don't invest, because my prediction is within the first 7 pages a reader will be ready to abandon this work of fiction. You can borrow mine."
4,Some rare showtunes,"Jerry Herman is one of Broadway's most skilled show tune composers. Dear World is not his best show by any means, but it has several numbers worth discovering and this album also has some splendid production photographs. The songs take a little getting used to, and they aren't really up to the standard of Hello Dolly, probably his best score, but their very unfamiliarity is actually a bonus for the amateur who fancies him or herself as a Broadway star. After all why do we buy these albums if not to sing the songs?"
1,This Game Stinks,"I bought this game one day, thinkin' it was like tony hawk, WRONG, the graphics stink, the music stinks, and the game is impossible to beat. If your going to buy this game sometime, your going to regret it, I did."
4,good support,"These are good stockings, but the shipping was too expensive from this 3rd party website."
1,Support Socks review,"The support socks supported my swollen calves. I would have wanted, and still want, to know the causes of the need for support socks, and what other treatment is available for swollen feet, ankles and calves. If the answer is to contact a dermatologist, I have done that, but their offices are closed on weekends."
5,Great product,"Great product. It does exactly what it sets out to do, which is allowing you to feel a swing with a straight left arm. You can still bend your elbow slightly, without hearing the crack, which is fine for me. I use it all the time on the range, and my swing has improved significantly. I am a .2 handicap golfer."
4,bent arm,"It clicks only when my arm is bent 45 degrees. However,it does keep me conscious of the fact that I need to keep the arm straight. I have achieved some success, but old habits die hard. I am sometimes able to stop in the middle of my back swing because I have heard the device click. If your are having a problem with keeping the left arm straight, I would try it."
3,"Some good aspects, some just okay.","Not a lot of real in depth info, experience, or tricks and tips. The text reminds me of lots of magazine build-up articles, ""disassemble this part, check clearance on that part, we used XYZ heads, etc."" I would rate the information just average. On the other hand, the photography is EXCELLENT and all in color. The book is almost worth the price just for that, but don't buy it with the idea of learning a lot. Frank Oddo and Tex Smith's books are better in that regard."
3,Rebuilding a Ford Flathead V-8,"This book is extremely beneficial for someone that wants to build a hot rod engine. The author explains what brand and part number he uses for different applications. He also explains all the machining that needs to be done and how to do it.However, if you are looking for an instruction manual to overhaul your stock engine, you will have to look elsewhere. I'm still looking for a detailed manual that will walk a first time engine builder through an overhaul."
2,How to build a flathead ford v8,If you are building an 8ba 49-53 Ford flathead this book may help if however you have a 32 -48 flathead v8 it is useless they should mention that .
1,Crappy Printer Lasting only as long as the warenty,"Seriously. This printer is a not good. I got it with my Imac about two years ago. I am a graphic designer and I print alot. The printer broke one month, one month after the warranty was up. I called cannon and they waived the warranty cause I said that I was in the print industry. But now, about another year, its completely broken. The paper spoolers only work on one side and wont feed the paper, when they do it gets jammed.I think if you use this printer only sparsely its good, and Cannon is helpful. But I think they knew just when it would break and your just so out of luck."
1,scans/prints of photos turn out reddish,"If you're picky about how your photos turn out, I don't recommend the MP460. Scanned photos show up reddish in hue (I even tested a photo with a green rug--it turned out reddish as well) and the colors are a bit washed-out. Printing directly from a digital photo does not solve the problem, as those prints have the same red problem. I know it's not a problem with my particular printer, since I tested out the MP460 at the store as well after returning mine, and it had the same issue."
2,Very expensive to operate,"Disappointed with this printer. In general, very easy to use. Connects well with Windows XP machine. Main drawback: I can only print about 50-100 pages before the printer starts asking for more ink. I have used about 3 reams of paper in the past year... 3 black carts and 2 color ones. Ouch!Do not recommend this printer. The ink tanks are very small and very pricey..."
2,Not up to Par,"I would never buy another PIXMA 460. It takes a long time to warm up; it is slow; most of all, the power cord disconnects from the machine about every third time I use it."
3,good printer,"It's a good printer and does all i expected it to do.it's easy to set up, prints off your camera's SD memory card or even your USB memory stick, apart from printing from the PC. It scans and color copies beautifully. It's easy to navigate between copy, scan and memory card functions cos each have their individual buttons. Choosing between b&w or color is a piece of cake too at a touch of a button. The user menu is very easy to understand & navigate. To sum it up, it's a great printer that's so easy to install and use, you may not even need to look at the manual. The only complaint i have so far is that it didn't come with it's own USB cables (to hook it up to the PC)."
4,all in all a nice product,"its a good printer but a little confusing when trying to make a copy or scan a document due to the many options available on these screens. i don't think it scans legal size paper and i think the PC has to be on just to make a copy, but it could also be my inexperience! there are also lots of features which i haven't tried yet with the photo software that is included (much like adobe photoshop)."
3,Canon Pixma MP460,First Item was defective and needed to be replaced. Product is very noisy and seems to use a lot of ink to produce copies and print in black. I am on my third black cartridge in the brief time I have had it. Have not printed any pictures yet.
5,"a good quality, multifunctional printer",I have had this printer about 1 year. It is very easy to use. The instruction manual is very easier to understand. The quality of the print outs and pictures is great. It is a bit on the loud side but it is acceptable.
2,"High Ink Usage, Quality Issues","I've owned my Canon Pixma MP460 for about three years. For the most part, it has worked out alright in that it offered basic performance. I did not wind up using it to scan pictures on a normal basis, but when I did it worked well for that purpose. On the other hand, it seems like there were always technical issues with this printer. It also uses a ton of ink, which is expensive. I'm looking for a new printer now because the roller feed has stopped working properly and, after contacting Epson for support, I was told that I can either 1) drive 30 minutes across town to their sole certified printer repair specialist for a cost of approximately $80, or 2) take advantage of their replacement discount program and but a new Canon printer at a whopping discount. I don't intend to take them up on either suggestion. It looks like the Epson Workforce line gets consistently good reviews. I think that I'll be switching over."
5,Top Notch,"I have nothing but praise for the Canon MP460. Set up was quick and easy. From the very start, the print quality has been excellent. I have not experienced any of the problems I read from earlier reviews (heavy red tint, etc.). I use this for normal everyday use -- color graphics, photos, and general text printing. I have used various papers of differing grades and weights. All worked flawlessly. Photograph print quality rivals anything I have seen from more expensive HP and Epson photo printers. The scanning function works wonderfully and the photocopy quality is fine (though a bit faint at times) for a smaller machine. This all-in-one gives great value for the price paid. I have only one complaint -- the replacement ink cartridges have not come down in price compared to others in the market. Though the MP460 is not an ink hog, replacement inks will be pricey for a while."
4,"great printer, but not as cheap per page as I hoped","I've had this about a month. It's easy to use, and prints GREAT photos--really impressive to me (though I'm admittedly no pro). Better than the HP I was using before, though that was at least a couple years old. Copies are fine. I haven't tried the scanner yet. Doesn't take up a ton of room on my desk (budget a little less than 2 feet by 2 feet). Not too noisy, reasonably quick. My only complaint is that it doesn't get the low price/page of B/W printing I was hoping for. I read somewhere (CNET I think) that it could get as low as $0.04/page, and that's way off. I'd say it gets about $0.08/page at best, maybe $0.10. So if mass black and white printing is your task, you might want to invest in a laser. But if you're like me and also want colour (including for photos), I think it's a good choice. The price for the printer itself seems pretty good to me."
2,A Sneaky Printer,"I bought this printer solely for the bluetooth functionality. I figured it was a little more expensive than some of the other similar models but the bluetooth would make up for the difference in price that I wouldn't have to spend on a USB cable. Bluetooth, however, is not built into the printer and requires a $50+ optional external device. This is a total bait and switch on behalf of canon. Don't let this happen to you."
1,"Paper feed problems after little time, Cannon service provides no assistance","With little use in a year time, (I was a deployed solidier and my wife traveled a lot), this machine started jamming by crinkling the paper on one side of the feed. I called Cannon for support, they had me clean the roll then told me it's a mechanical error, they would be happy to give me a discount on a new machine. I will never buy a Cannon printer again!!!"
4,Canon Pixma MP460,Good printer only complain is that it takes a few seconds to warm up before actually printing but the quality and speed is great once it gets going.
3,Exactly what we were looking for ... (REVISED),"Needed a product to keep correct time in frequent power outages ... this does the job (even right out of the box. Needed a product which would be easier to see at night (with aging eyes) ... this does the job (huge bright red numbers. Needed a product with loud startling alarm sounds ... this does the job (well, maybe not quite so loud!)Very pleased with the clock. No complaints.UPDATE: The clock died in 2010 ... no warning ... just lost all power and digital view. Should last longer than 3 years in my opinion, but good while it lasted!"
1,Bad Alarm Clock,"This is my first bad experience with any purchase from Amazon. The Equity Time Insta-set Alarm Clock failed to keep time. It lost 2 to 3 hours each day. I emailed Equity about the problem and they sent me instructions for setting the time. This, of course, did not fix the problem with the faulty clock. I liked the look of the clock, so I sent the $17 clock back to the company, which cost $5 along with $5 to fix it. Now, one month later, I have not received a replacement clock. So I am out $27.I finally received a replacement clock that works. I like the clock."
1,Worked for 2 yearsbut now it doesn't keep time,"I bought this clock about 3 years ago and it worked fine until about 6 months ago. It started to run slow about 3 or 4 minutes. Now it is off by 20 minutes and I have to throw it out. Because the clock is supposed to set the time automatically when its plugged in, there are no buttons to adjust the time. Unplugging it and plugging it back in does not fix the problem. Shouldn't these clocks last more than a couple of years?"
4,bright accurate LED clock,"I was looking for an easy to read at night LED display alarm clock. I got the Insta-Set with biggest numerals 1.8"" for myself and the smaller display, this clock, for my wife. Besides a bright display, the clock is preset for correct time at the factory so this is a plug and play clock. Good value compared to clocks available at local pharmacies and Target type stores."
3,DST feature useless now.,"Starting in 2007, the automatic DST correction is useless. It's hardwired to be the first weekend in April, which is no longer the start of the Spring period of DST. However, its time memory still is great when the power goes out, and its big bright display is wonderful for when I wake up in the middle of the night without my glasses on. I'd give it a 5 if it weren't for the DST issues."
1,insta but late,"To Steven, good luck with your purchase. I have one myself that seems to be getting late by 2 minutes every year. I've had mine for more than 3 years and now it's 7 minutes late. Only consolation, I could still use it for the alarm, just make sure I add 7 minutes more. It looks really nice but it's true what they say, you get your money's worth. Equity 0.9-inch Red LED Display Insta-Set Alarm Clock"
1,"Blink, Blink, Blink","The colon between minutes and seconds blinks constantly. It takes about 10 seconds for it to become really annoying. A decent clock with large numbers and the handy self-set feature. It just blinks, and blinks, and blinks...."
1,"Great clock, unless you care what time it is!","I bought this clock because I am visually impaired. It has lovely bright large numbers. It also has a great feature - it comes with the time pre-set at the factory so you don't have to re-set it manually after a power outage. Small problem: It runs slow. Since I bought it in April 2010, it has lost 4 minutes, and continues to slow down. And the ""Insta-set"" feature leaves the user with no way to manually adjust the time. So it's a great clock for the visually impaired... unless of course you really want to know the time, in which case, avoid this one!"
1,Loses 2 minutes a week,"I'm so used to $10 watches that are accurate to a minute a year that I never suspected a plug-in clock would need to be reset every few days! Even a stopped clock is accurate twice a day, which is better than this..."
3,Incorrect instructions and old watch battery when you get it.,"Watch battery only last about 3 years so it may be about dead when you get it. Time was accurate when it left factory. Instructions are not clear. Must unplug power, remove 9V and dead watch battery under screw cover, plug in, You my have to press small balck reset button next to battery under the screw cover. Then press DST and hold down until time appears press +- and DST to to accurately manually set time and then install new watch CR2023 battery."
1,Time is not accurate,"I bought one of these and thought it was great, so I bought 2 more. I noticed the time on my digital watch was different, but I kept assuming an atomic clock had to be right, so I kept changing my watch. Finally I put 2 of these clocks in the same room and found the times displayed differed by 8 minutes -- one showed 8:00 am and the other showed 8:08am. Then I checked them both against the official time and found one was 9 minutes behind and the other was 17 minutes behind the official time. This difference has persisted for weeks and still exists. Whatever they are supposed to do to adjust the time, they fail to do it accurately. Worse there is no way to fix it, and then last week they began to be 1 hour behind our official time, actually 1 hour and 8 minutes and 1 hour and 17 minutes behind. I just ordered new clocks as they are driving me nuts this way. They don't work."
2,Slightly misleading,"I purchased this clock under the misunderstanding that it was a radio controlled clock and that I would not have to constantly reset the time to match the other radio controlled clocks in the house. However, it really is a clock within a clock and the instant on function is due to the internal clock that runs off of a separate battery. The price is low and the display is nice a big so it could be seen across a room or by someone with poor eyesight when not corrected. The major drawback is that the internal clock is not very accurate. Within a month, the clock is already off by 30 seconds compared to the radio controlled clocks in the house. As a result, I have to change the time frequently to match the other clocks in the house."
5,Nice filter,"Works great! I mainly use it for moving water like falls, river streams and outside portraits. It's a high quality glass that made in Japan!"
5,Excellent product,"Really great to have this filter. I strongly recommend buying this filter, proved very helpful to photograph water surfaces and water falls."
3,Perales as Poetry,"I have just bought this item and once again, I am very impressed with the quality of the recording and the wonderful sounds of Perales' voice. For me, Spanish is not a native language although my grandparents were Spanish. But Perales, like many other Spanish musicians, makes his work so poetic that it could be read as well as sung. ""Love, 'tis a drop of water in a glass"" for just one example. I enjoy this album very much"
5,Haven't receive the item.,I haven't receive the items that I ordered. I don't know when will I receive it. If you can help me out pls. do.
3,"If you have another version, don't buy this one","Unless you want the rookies from the class of 2001, along with the latest roster changes. But other than that, the game is exactly the same, if not a little bit worse, than 2000 and 2001.Also, what is up with the ""eyewear"" feature in the created player screen? What basketball player has ever worn any of the types of sunglasses they have? They need to get rid of all the funky sunglasses, and put in some basic goggles, the facemask that Laimbeer and Lucious Harris wore, and maybe a couple basic frames, Rambis style, and maybe one other. But all these stupid sunglasses, come on!"
1,THIS STUFF SUCKS,"I bought this for my ps and i am [upset]. this is basicly nba live 2001 with a diff movie, music and some roster changes. they didnt even bother to change the graphics, play modes, or even the anouncing. if u r looking for a good nba game dont waste [your money] on this go for shootout 2002 or something."
2,not soft,i used to buy the tlc yarn with the kitten on it from rag shop. it was real soft. this stuff was rough like rh super saver. it cost a lot. i can get rh for $2. i had to pay shipping. i can get better buy from [...] or [...]
4,Healing Touch of Mary,"I absolutely loved this book. Reading the true encounters with the Blessed Virgin Mary was so inspiring and left me with a very peaceful and hopeful feeling. This is a book to be read in one sitting or over several days, whichever the reader prefers. It is a book to be read over and over again - a keeper!"
1,Don't Buy!!,"The bike was easy to put together, but what a pain to use! The front of the bike came pre-assembled and was not straight! So the bike would not go straight. I was very disappointed and even more so when I when to return it. The Shipping was very expensive and that was not refundable! I do not recomend this item!!!!"
5,Paid Dearly but Love the Music,"I have always loved this soundstrack and had the album years ago. When I ran across a video clip of this on YouTube, I was reminded how sublime the music was and so sought out to purchase it on CD. That turned out to be an expensive endeavor, but one that I do not regret. Basil did an excellent job with this early score and I listen to it often, particularly when visiting any tropical location. If you liked the move, you'll love the soundtrack!"
5,Worth every penny,"Essential study for anyone who plays with a pick. Both beginning and advanced players of any style will benefit from the information the author presents.The lessons are very clear and well articulated. This is the first material I have seen that breaks down - to a microscopic level - the physical motions and awareness that are necessary to use a pick on acoustic, electric or nylon."
4,Queens Forever!,"Yeah the Bronx is the birthplace of hip hop, but Queens put it on the map. All the original royal family members of hip hop hailed from there. Run DMC(The Kings), Salt N Pepa(The Queens) and LL (The Prince). Can't front on Queens. This album is great because it showcases the new artists as well as pay homage to some of the pioneers(Shan, Shante and Craig G). From the moment I heard ""Da Bridge 2001"" I knew that I had to have this album. Nas remains on point despite the haters saying he fell off. Mobb Deep and CNN hold theirs down. ""Straight Outta QB"" is an East Coast version of NWA's classic. ""Self Conscience"" pairs Nas and Prodigy and that combo will always be butta.I like the whole album because it is great and it is a refreshment from all the garbage that's coming out today. If you love raw hip hop, cop dis. One!"
4,It's worth buying,It's not as good as I thought it would be but it is still a good cd. Our way by CNN and Iman Thug is the best track on here. Prodigy and Nas also did a great job. Straight outta QB is a classic. The rhymes do get a little repetitive at times but it is still a good CD to just relax and listen to
3,"Could Have Been Better, But Nas Saves It","This album is not as good as I thought it would be, but it isn't all that bad either. There are some gems that make it a keeper. We Live This, which features the return of the old-school legend, Roxanne Shante, is one the bangers on this compilation. Find Ya Wealth is a year-old gem from Nas. Street Glory pairs Nas up with Pops, who is kind of impressive on the mic. We Break Bread is another standout tracks where Craig G steals the show in the last verse. Fire and Pile Raps are highlights as well, but I think that one of the most compelling tracks on the album is Self-Conscience with Nas and Prodigy. The tracks that I just mentioned are worth the price of the album alone. The album does have a few mis-steps, but overall, it is a good compilation. Nas' lyrics that up the slack were some of the album's guest fall short. I recommend this."
2,This is getting rediculous,"QB Finest sums up the problems in the world of hip-hop today. Every big name rapper has to have a clique. And in this clique, most of the rappers are average at best, and som are just boring. Here, the only member of Nas' QB clique i would want to hear more of is Nashiem. I don't know if Nas is just so good he outshines them (like on Da Bridge 2001), or if these guys are as weak as i think they are. Not that they lack teqnique, but songs like Our Way, we Live This and Break Bread are just lyricaly boring and have no concept. However Nas does return to old form with the should be classic Find Ya Wealth, and comes with a lyrical intensity not seen in years on evey verse (especially with Prodigy).Honestly, the only non-Nas cut on hear that in legit is the Prodigy Freestyle (track #10, and I'm not even a Mobb Deep fan. Don't beleiv e the hype. The only peolpe who should buy this disc are Nas fans just trying to get tracks with him rapping on it."
3,"Pretty Appaloosa, Predictable Story","Young squaw Mary Blackfeather (Adele Palacios) believes that her spotted Nez Percé Indian pony, Holy Smoke (played by Mt. Baldy's Holy Smoke), has what is takes to win in rodeos. But her tribe needs money, and she's forced to sell him - when the horse winds up with an abusive cowboy, Mary decides that she must risk everything to get her beloved pony back. She does, and trains him for a very dangerous but profitable relay race called the Hell's Mountain Stampede. If they win, Mary's tribe will be rich and she will be able to keep Holy Smoke. Hm, I wonder what happens?Staci Layne Wilson"
1,I thought it [stunk].,"My friend let me borrow this game because he said it was really addicting and really fun. So I came home and started playing it. I got so bored, so fast. There was no point, I didn't even know what exactly I was supposed to do. Grow crops? How exciting! Oh, build a relationship with the townspeople? That's all right, they dont even talk, and it takes forever for them to finish a sentence..."
1,Absolutely Horrible,The graphics are the only good thing about this game. The plot sounded really cool (just like the other harvest moon games but this was disapointing) i wanted to cook! But I couldn't even figure out how too!
2,boooooooooooooooooooring,"ok, i don't think i'm an ""action junkie."" i like the sims 2, i don't play halo 2. but this game is sloooooooooooow. after a few minutes, i was sick of it. also, no real tutorial to tell you what to do. you just wake up in a room, with a cow milker in your inventory. oh yay, i can go milk a cow!!! that right there is the pinnacle of gaming entertainment, my friends (sarcasm). i liked the old sega genesis harvest moon better, where you have a nice full screen, no annoying 3d cameras. you know you can water, harvest your crops, deal with your cows, go into town, etc. simpler, faster, and more fun. also this game has japanese-type graphics (i'm sorry, but there are a million anime titles out there, did they have to turn harvest moon into one??) and annoying townspeople that i hate. i wish i had bought harvest moon: back to nature for PS back in the day. now it costs $40 online, but it looks like it has that sega genesis harvest moon style that i like. definitely skip this one!!!"
3,Just one year,"I have played other Harvest Moon games and I like them all, and I like this one too. The only problem is that you only get one year. In the other games, you can form lasting relationships, get married, even have kids, get divorced, remarry, etc. year after year. This one starts you from scratch after a year (you lose) or you manage to save the homeland (you win). You get to keep your stuff, but all the relationships start over. It's cool that there are different endings, but I lost interest after the second one- and that's only because I was putting up a brave face since the kids got it for me for Christmas and I didn't want them to feel bad! I was pretty disgusted the minute I realized I'd lost all the ground I'd gained just cause I beat the game.This was particularly disappointing because I thought surely the PS2 version would have all kinds of extra side quests and fun stuff to do after the first year."
5,An instant Classic,"This version of Harvest Moon in my opinion, is a classic. It is so much easier than all of the other ones. The others made you feel guilty, becuase if you weren't doing one thing as much as another, then you felt guilty. Say you were working hard on your crops in HM64, but were doing a poor job on your social life. That could hurt you, but then if you shifted even a bit, it could hurt your farm. This one spends less time on farming, and more time on saving the homeland! If you like the farming part, then dont worry, because you still farm. The farming is much easier, because every hour is about a minute in our time! Less land to farm on, and the grass is already growing for you, and you never have to replant it! I recomend this game to everyone!"
2,Harvest Moon: save the homeland,"The game runs clunky and I swear it runs at only 40 frames a second. Last time I played a game that gave me a headache and caused nausea after 2 or 3 hrs. I discovered it was runnnig at 40 fps. I even timed the in-game day clock and it runs twice as fast as two psp harvest moons I am currently playing (harvest moon boy and girl and harvest moon hero of leaf valley, now those I recommmed whole heartedly - awesome:)). I recommed that whatever you do, do not waste your money on this title. It would be a serous purchase mistake. Thank you and good gaming:)"
4,Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland,"Graphic fair.. Game good..Interaction between charaters good. Interesting adventures and the mulitple endings is a challengen. Major issue controlers inteaction with game. Difficult to get cows to move directionally, also to get direction right in watering crops.Dark when rainy and somewhat difficult to see..To short of a day and hard to get everything accomplished in the time frame. Overall a nice game.."
3,Lazy Natsume...,I played Harvest Moon for about 3 months... I loved it. Now when I play save the homeland I wonder if Natsume got high while making this game...Graphics (+)Music (+)Kitchen (+)Tricks (+)Cant Get Married (-)Bad Gameplay (-)Limited Crops (-)Map Spreaded Farther apart (-)Too Short (-)Bad Storyline (-)Less Tools (-)Overall I think this game is okay but is mainly about the endings (9) which i think Natsume is trying to do. Not getting married or not having a baby and the areas being farther away are the big reason why I disliked this game and I blame Natsume for being lazy and slacking off on this game.. But i forgive him since he has created the orginal harvest moon (!BUY IT!) that is 5 times better than Save the Homeland.I only Recommend you buy this game if you've never played Harvest Moon or don't care about any of the bad changed in the game.
3,Harvest Moon,"Well, besides not getting married in this game, i find it great, good graphics, lots of items, and able to cook is great, and 9 differnt endings is great considering i beat one way in a day ( about 9 hours ), it was the blue bird of happiness one, also the dog which can do tricks is good, its supposed to herd cows but i have not found that out yet, but its an all around game that will get u hooked for a month or 2"
3,well what can i say?,"once again ps2 has fallin short of its once knowen glory...this game is slow going, in the fact there isnt much too do if at all.. the chickens die for no good reason , you cant cook too save your life!you work a part time just for pennys! was this a real life story of some poor farmer?? i dont get what much of the idems are used for?? and too think i loved harvest moon on gamecube, gamecube is way cooler and most fun when it comes too this game title! so be warned of that now. dont let another 30.oo slip threw your hands the way it did mine :(("
4,Great Game for Children,"I am a mom and played this game for hours. I have not played the other harvest moon's but am looking forward to it. I think all children should play this game, it shows them responsibilty, on owning a pet, working and making money either for buying or selling. This game is a great roleplaying game. I am really looking forward to playing back to nature, which offers much more. This game is reality (how life really is when you have to work for things), but in a childrens form. BUY IT!"
2,Not as good as other Moons.,"Harvest Moon:Save the Homeland is a dissapointment. You can't raise a family like you used to. You don't even get a dog(at first at least). It is also so boring and the controls suck!!!!! It doesn't have the freshness of Harvest Moon 64. If you are a Harvest Moon fan, take my edvice and get Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life instead."
2,"Great Game, Bad Plot","Harvest Moon Save the Homeland, was in my opinion the worst Harvest Moon game. First off, no family. It'll just be you. You can't get married, and you have no dog! There is a stray dog however, and it takes a while for it to adapt to you and start being your friend. Also a thumbs down is there is no festivals! How can you play a Harvest Moon like that! Festivals in 64, Back to Nature.. they were the best. Save the Homeland just doesn't have the charm the others had. However, the Graphics are the best! It is more a game for people who don't play often or littler kids. The game plot is OK, however years.. and seasons.. are a little messed up. Saving the homeland takes a pretty long time if you dont play every week or so.. and I just don't have the time, so.. if you want to buy this game.. prepare. It could be different than what you think."
2,Don't Buy It!,"I own this game, and it doesn't come close to the first Harvest Moon (Harvest Moon 64)! In this game, there are no sheep, no festivals, you can't get married, no babies, the game ends after 1 year, and you don't have a lot of fields to plant crops in! The only good thing about this game is that the graphics are, I must say, the best I have ever seen! But I don't think the graphics are worth all that money for the game!! So, don't spend your money on it! It STINKS!"
4,Never played before,Ive never played this version of Harvest Moon but ive played a harvest moon before those games are great. on my harvest moon game I have a female cow named Moe! haha Im going to be a farmer someday Haha(...)
5,Totaly Great Game,"This is one of the best games I ever played. My only complaint is you can't get married (girlfriends allowed), no festivals ,nlimited crops. The good things are 9 endings, great graphics, nice sound, n farming is easier. It is also harder to get a horse n a dog. N I like the part about being able to cook n eat what you cooked. You also get to ride your horse in town n trainyour dog. When you start the field is already cleaned up. The characters have their own personalities which are great. The controls also need some getting used to. Although I still think Back to Nature is better I'm a big fan of the Harvest Moon series. This is kinda disapointing but to me its a totaly great game so its definitely worth buying but be warned you might not like it as much as I do."
2,Worst HM!,"If you want to get an HM game, get Back to Nature or A Wonderful Life. This has best or second best graphics, but not much else. The girls are pretty interesting, but you can't marry or date them. It doesn't have holidays, it only has 4 crops, few animals, and it's just not nearly as good as any of the other games. Rent it if you feel you must try it."
2,Too short,"Listen very carefully! This game only lasts one year, and the days are really short. The town is small, but to me that's not good.You can't get married in this game. half of the game is loading. I bought this game after I heard a review close to this, and now I regret buying it. Listen to me, if you want a harvest moon game, get A Wonderful Life, and they even have a special edition for PS2. The graphics in that game are a little better. If you just want all of the HM games, I'm ok with that, but pay attention to what this review says. [...] I hope I warned you enough."
5,New Harvest Moon Fan - I am addicted!,"I was looking for a quest game to play on Playstation 2 during the winter months. I can't take the stress of having to kill enemies or battle bosses, so I wanted something simple, fun and interesting. I used to love ""Myst"" for PC, so I was looking for something along those lines if not simpler. I have never played any of the other Harvest Moon games, so my opinion is based solely on Save the Homeland for PS2. I absolutely love this game!! I can't stop playing it. If you are older like me and are just looking for something entertaining to get your mind off of everyday life, then you will enjoy this game. The graphics are very simple but the storyline is fun and interesting. It is not too easy and not too hard, and nothing has stressed me out as of yet. I love running my own little imaginary farm and tending to my crops and animals. It really is fun and relaxing. I can't wait to try the original Harvest Moon for PS1."
4,Not nearly as fun as the prequels!,"The Harvest moon series has been my favourite for years, since SNES version, but the new Save the Homeland game left out so many things that made the series so great! You can only grow 4 crops, and the focus is no longer building a great farm, it's about making friends with the right people so you can save the town. There is no more wooing a lady in town in hopes of getting married and staring a family, not nearly as many recipies or ingredients for cooking, no special town events like the harvest festival or cooking contest. So if you Loved playstation HM or Harvest moon 64, this new version is going in a different direction. I still recommend it, but maybe to rent with Gamefly.com or borrow it from someone, because the fun factor runs out quickly."
3,The others are better,"The reviews of Harvest Moon are mostly positive and mostly correct. However, in this game each year you start from scratch as far as friendships go, so it does not have the lasting appeal of other versions.This version is fine if you want short games you don't really get attached to. If you want a better Harvest Moon Experience, get the N64 version of Gameboy Advance version. If all you have is a PS2, prepare to enjoy the game, but not for very long."
4,Good but not that good,"I have a PS2 and a bunch of meh friends have GameCube, and thus they have Harvest Moon: A Wonder Life. I heard a lot of good things about it so I got the one for PS2. At first I hated it. But that was my fault.Anyway... I really like taking care of meh animals and crops... and after you start getting events it's all good... but then an event interrupts your event chain ((y'see, there are nine different ways to 'save the homeland' and nine different chains of events)) and then you have to start from scratch. Example: I start on the one to look for the butterfly. Next I start working on the Goddess Dress. Then I start on the one helping Katie win the Cake Contest. And THEN I go back to looking for the butterfly.I dunno if anyone else hates this or if I'm the only one having this problem, but it's very annoying. Besides that, I really like this game a lot. ^_^;; I'd still recommend a different Harvest Moon game though."
1,What a Dopey Game.,"After playing it for awhile, I realize all you get to do is play with cows and chickens, and a dog if your lucky. What a boar. The ""Harvest Land"" in this game is so small I wonder where all the memory went to. Your main goals are to bake goods, farm the land, then attempt to earn money that way, so you can buy something to give as a ""gift"" to some townsfolk fool. This way the townspeople will give you clues to go on stupid little adventures to get to one of nine stupid little endings to the game. Oh, and if you miss their birthday dont expect any help. Save up enough money and you can buy a kitchen for your crappy little shack, whoopie!Im sure glad I could get $11 for this game when I sold it. Thats the best part of the game, getting rid of it."
2,What happend?,"There are a lot of reasons why I didn't like this game. You don't get to plant as many crops as Harvest Moon #1, there are no festivals, you can't upgrade your barn or chicken coup and you don't have as many tools. The only upgrade to your house you can get is to buy a dog house and a kitchen. The days go by too fast and you can't get a lot done. Also unlike the first game, in this one you can't get married. There are no legendary fish to catch, and in fact there is only one spot in the game you can fish and it isn't very much fun. I don't know why the designers of this one changed it so much, but it could have been so much better then what they made it. There are a lot more things I didn't like about this game, but I'll leave it there for now. If you liked Harvest Moon #1, you won't like #2 This is a game I wish I didn't waste my money on. For shame on you Natsume for killing a good game!"
2,not much here,"I agree with the other reviewer on here; there really isn't too much to do in this game. For a system like the PS2, there should be a lot to write about. Sadly this isn't the case with this version of Harvest Moon, so I would advise you to save your money on this one. The graphics aren't even all that great, and the sound is dated. I'm not sure why this game is priced anywhere near 50 dollars, especially with games like Grand Theft 3 and Tony Hawk 3 on the market."
2,Horrible......,"Being a great harvest moon fan with her brand new PS2, I wanted a harvest moon game. I had played Back to Nature, 64, harvest moon 2, and so on. I brought the game for 10 bucks down at the mall. I couldn't wait to try it out! The first few days I played it were fun, don't get me wrong, but I was more looking forward to a game like Harvest moon 64. A free-form game that yes, would have a side-quest or two. I was in for a BIG surprise. The game is mainly character interaction. The only two animals you needed were your dog and horse.Pro's1. Good graphics2.You have multiple choices of horse color.3. Some of the quests are kinda funCon's1.Not really a con...but do you see the way they sit on the horse? talk about uncomfortable o.O2. The only two buyable animals you can get are cows and chickens, no not even sheep.3. You only get 4 game months of time to do stuff."
2,Fairly good game,"This game itself is amusing, and can be a bit addictive, but if you are a true Harvest Moon fan, you will get bored of this game fast. Unlike virtually all of the other HM games, you cannot get married, nor do you start out with a dog or horse. The gametime only lasts one year, in which you must pick a track. You can still have crops, and there are cows, no sheep. You must work to get a dog to like you, and become friends with the other farmers so they will give you a horse.This game is a bit harder than the other HM games, and I would reccomend you try Back to Nature in place of this game, which I find is more engrosing."
2,Ehhh... not what it lived up to be.,"This harvest moon game takes away nearly EVERYTHING the older ones gave. In this game you cant do anything except go talk to people.The crops suck because they purposly made it so that you hardly have to water the crops. You cant even get a girlfriend! And as opposed to the previous Harvest moon games... you MUST end your game after a year (and it only takes a month to win it). After that you keep your shack and animals and stuff... but all the people you've worked so hard to gain their respect just forget you. And then you have to go through all of the cienamatics again.I gave it a two because the 64 version of this game is much better. There is a ton more to do and it is better scripted. Natsume just rushed to start this game up, but I do look foward to their next Harvest Moon Game."
3,It could have been better!!!,It could have been better if i wasn't getting screen sick from all the motion of the 3-d style. Especially when I am trying to find where I am going. I get lost a lot so I keep on moving back and forth. Almost wanted to puke. So I started it but I don't think I can end it because of that. It kind of reminded me of Kingdom Hearts because you have to move around a lot with that too. I didn't enjoy that too much either. I probably like harvest moon ps1 better.
2,Don't get it!,"I own this game, and it doesn't come close to its original (Harvest Moon 64)! In Save the Homeland, you can't get married, there are no sheep, no festivals, no babies, the game ends after 1 year of play, you must work for a horse, and there aren't many fields to grow crops! I must say though, the graphics are the best I have ever seen! But I didn't think the graphics were worth the price for the game. So, my opinion is, Don't get it! If you don't have Harvest Moon64, spend your money on that!"
2,What the...!?,"This game has a great concept, lots of things to do, and a cute look. Why the low score? Well, the in-game time system is, in a word, wack. I would barely get outside and get my bearings, and it would be mid-afternoon already! Then, one time, I got lost trying to find a path in the ""morning"", and by the time I found it (a few real-world minutes later), it was ""night""!! How am I ever supposed to build a farm and save the homeland if all the stores are closed by the time I get to them!? This game could have been Animal-Crossing caliber, but instead it's just confusing and weird. Too bad. I was really looking forward to it."
3,Clear up,This is to clear up every thing aboot geting hitched and datingNO maridge is NOT one of the endings and you can NOT date the girls AT ALL in this gamer they are JUST characters like all the other characters. theres NO dating no maridge AT ALL Clear? GOODP.S. OTHER VERSIONS MUCH BETTER
3,Don't Get IT!,"Harvest Moon Save the homeland is not worth the money! The graffects, I must say, are GREAT! Actually, they're the best graffects I've ever seen! But Harvest Moon 64, for Nintendo 64, is a much better game! In this game, all you do is save the homeland. In Harvest Moon 64, you can marry, have a baby, and the game goes on and on! In this game, the game ends after 1 year..then you have to start over again! So, my opinion is...IT STINKS! DON'T GET IT!"
5,cool game,"Harvestmoon save the homeland is a really cool game, its unlike all the others where money is really important because its not in this game. In other game you have to grow a certain amount of crops and things like that. in this game you have to make friends with everyone in town in order to save the town in 1 year before they build a theme park. all and all I think this game is really cool if you liked the other one I am sure that you will like this one so go out and buy it."
3,Another of Dana's Amazing Reviews!,"It's a pretty fun game...It's fun to play once, but it's pretty repetative, and not one of those things you would want to play more than once, even tho it has 9 possible endings. You have to kind of develop a routine to survive, for example, every day, I would wake up, wake up the chickens and get the eggs, brush and milk the cows, water the crops, do part-time work at brownie farm, go foraging, sell my stuff, go home, and go to sleep. After days of doing this it gets a bit boring, and the only really exciting times were when my corn could be harvested or a baby calf was born. mostly pretty boring, but it was fun the first time."
3,it was ok.....,"it was an ok game it was very fun at first but you will hate it after awhile and you will wonder to your self why did i buy this game? Whats the difference between paper world and not?anywho i loved the game for awhile, but im differnt from many people and maybe you will enjoy it!"
1,Don't bother.,"I was forced to read this book in the fifth grade, and I was decidedly unimpressed. The writing is mediocre, the metaphors are too literal, and the entire book is boring. The writer obviously couldn't decide where the symbolism ended and the reality began. It may have started a fantasy, but it didn't end that way. I was not moved or touched in anyway by the girl tunnelling around in the walls like a termite. The only thing I'm glad about is that I didn't pay for it or keep it. My advice? Don't bother reading this book. Save your time and money for something better."
5,This is great book written by an author w/ an amazing mind.,"Patrice Kindl is an terrific author who uses her imagination and creativity to weave a wonderful webb for readers everywhere. Her works are an inspiration to many young writers, including myself. Anna is a great character who teaches readers how to find who they are and be proud of it! ""The Woman in the Wall"" is a brilliant masterpiece that everyone should have the honor to experience."
5,Wall Power!!!,"The Woman in the Wall was a strange but very clever book. I read the book in a day before I realized it. The main character is Anna. She is a very shy little seven year old who sets herself away from family and the rest of the world. As years go by, she builds her own little life behind a wall in her family home. She is invisible to everyone but she makes her presence known. Anna is extremely handy around the house and is a perfect seamstress. This wonder girl almost seems too good to be true. Anna feels a certain amount of power by living behind the wall. She has peep holes in the walls where she spies on her family and their friends, nevertheless they cannot see her. In reading this book it is very unrealistic, yet very lifelike at the same time. Quirky little Anna just brings excitement and wonder to the novel and keeps the readers turning the pages. I would love to read a sequel to this book and find out what became of the little wall flower."
3,okay,"The book is about a girl name Anna. She a shy person and lives in the wall. Half of the time her family doesn't see her. Anna spends all day in the wall; she even built her own passage way. Anna has younger sister and one who is older. She is a fourteen year old who never went to school. She lives with her mom. Anna's dad took a job at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. and got lost somewhere in the building. Anna really never got to see her dad. When a letter gets thrust through the wall she must decide if she's going to come out of hiding or stay in hiding for the rest of her life. I would recommend reading this book."
3,Pretty Good,At first the book was really confusing and I had trouble figuring how tall she was etc. But after awhile it was completely captivating. A little slow at first but definitely worth it in the long run.
3,wow,"this book was simply enchanting. it took me into a world i knew existed, but refused to accept. i specifically enjoyed the psychological and sociological overtones in this peice. its a good read if your on the beach, or a rainy day time killer."
5,roundup works,"I have been using roundup on my farm for several years. If used as directed, it works very well. All weeds die within two to seven days."
1,It's supposed to do what?,"We sprayed this product as directed on a light to moderate growth of grass, dandelions, and other miscellaneous weeds in a greenbelt along our house. That was on Sunday, 05 February. Today is Wednesday, 15 February and the vegetation has yellowed some but definitely has not browned-out and died. I guess I'll give the area another spray but as expensive as this product is, it should have worked as advertised."
5,"Works, But too expensive!!","Works good.But I can't understand why it cost so much??What the heck is in it, to make it so expensive?Liquid GOLD!!"
1,This is not good,Round Up has been proven to cause birth defects. It is very dangerous for families and especially pregnant women. Use an organic version
3,OK quality,"Some time it make noise, after warm up, noise is gone.Compare to White Rodgers 90-380, it is larger, more expansive and make noise."
1,Intermittent,"This was the right form factor for me, and initially worked great. However, after using it for a week, I'm finding that the contacts on it are somewhat intermittent and sometimes it will fail to engage the closures fully when the coil is energized.It does run a but warm when energized, and makes a slight buzzing sound."
1,buzzing,bought 4 and 4 out of 4 buzz loudly! still work but not happy. only running small grundfos pump and 35 watt fan.
1,Do NOT buy/rent this game!!,"Any review of this game giving it over 1 star was written by one of the world's kindest individuals. This is easily the worst game I have ever played in all of my gaming days. Not even a child would get enjoyment out of this poor, poor excuse for entertainment. All of the other reviews are accurate in describing the low quality graphics, controls, challenges which litter this game."
3,Good Game but I've seen better,I know this will date me but I've always loved Frogger since I got my Atri when I was 10 yrs old...but this game gives me a headache. You can never seen where your going and there is no way to freeze the camera angle in one position. You might need to turn around to fight the bad guy but the camera is still facing the other way and you can't see to excape/fight. My husband says I just need to get use to the new stile but I'll take my Atri (or Super Mario Brothers) over this any day.
2,Not what you expect,"I rented this because Frogger was my wife's favoriate game on PS1. We were excited to play this. After about an hour, it was back in the case. This is NOTHING like the PS1 model, it is a direct rip-off of Mario Brothers in 3-D. But it's not even as good as Mario. It's just a frog running around trying to get as many coins as possible.If you like Mario Brothers, you'll like this. It's a good choice if PS2 is your only system.If you're looking for what frogger is known for, you'll have to wait until the next one."
1,Frogger's Quest is Bogus!,I received Frogger's Quest for Christmas and really am turned off. It is the absolute worst programmed game I have played in the past 10 years. Frogger gets stuck for no reason causing you to reboot. The game story line is very thin with extremely weak character development. This game would be impressive if it were 1991 instead of 2001. Save your money and avoid Frogger's Quest.
1,TOTAL RIP OFF!!!!!,"This game sucks!! You cannot control the character at all! Very jerky. Got it for the kids, they lasted about 5 minutes on it. I was expecting much more. Do not buy!!"
1,A RIP OFF !!!!!!!,"This is the worst PS2 game I have play. The controls are jerky and you cannot control Frogger's movements when it counts. I guess they did not test this game before they release it to the public. If you don't trust my judgement, please rent first before buying."
3,Frogger is good but coulda been better....,"I've always liked the Frogger series so, when they decided to bring it out as a 3-D game, I thought the idea was cool and could really be an awesome game. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case when I set down and played the game. Although graphically, the game looks awesome. It's the controls and other issues that brought the game down to me. One annoying thing to me was getting stuck in certain areas of the game, literally. I'd find myself in places that I couldn't get out of, like under the ground. This was a glitch that seriously needed work on. Besides those two annoying issues, the game overall was pretty good. I just feel it coulda been better. Much better.My recommendation is it's worth a rental or, at least, a [X] price tag....but nothing more.If there is a Sequel to this game, I do hope they work on those issues or alot of people will be driven away."
2,Okay,"It was okay. The camera angles are ridiculous. You're walking along and suddenly you can only see behind you. Also, it is frustrating when you can't kill those bugs or something. I'd say that you have to have a lot of patience to really like this game."
5,Kewl,"Frogger: The Great Quest is awesome! You get to fight vicious pike fish, killer bugs, and frightening cats. You also get to encounter frog fairies, humans, bears, alligators, and much more. The graphics are almost perfect, but sometimes there are some hard-to-see places. All in all this is a super game and it is worth every penny."
2,Terrible game!,"This PS2 game is pretty bad. The storyline is rather stupid. I found the graphics to be colorful but overall not that great. Also, you spend a lot of time swimming in rivers and waterfalls, but there is NO sound of flowing water! I played this game for about an hour before giving up on it. Maybe little kids will like the colorful, cartoony graphics, but that's about it. Definitely not worth buying to add to your library. Rent it instead if you really want to play it."
1,Worst...platformer...ever,"Sadly there's nothing that can be said of this game in the positive, except for perhaps the colors and the relative size of the environments.Simple doddering enemies, the most wretched controls of all time, pointless collecting (the ""reward system"" is laughable and nothing more), poor overall graphics, [poor] framerate and brainless dialogue make for a terrible game through and through. After 1 hour and several levels in, I wound up chucking the game -- not in frustration, but in disgust.The only audience fit for this game is the 4-9 year old crowd, however, they'll probably only wind up crying after trying to get around the horrible controls, which you can't.If you're a big platform fan you may want to check out Sly Cooper instead."
3,Frogger? How about Faker?,"While this story appeared pretty good at first, I quickly found this game more frustrating than it was worth. The controls are awkward and even after trying to play for several days I still could not get used to them. The graphics are pretty good, but not good enough to make up for the oddball controls. I thought to have my 9 yr old daughter play and she couldn't even get the hang of it. All in all, this game was a waste of money as I don't think I'll ever play it again. Not even if I'm bored beyond belief."
1,The worst game of the year,"Easily one of the worst games of the year. The controls are terrible. Euthanasia in mind, I threw Frogger off a cliff into the maws of a giant fish."
2,No product photo,I would have been able to give this item consideration if the seller had a photo posted that displayed the actual item. I passed on this purchase only because I couldn't make out from the 10 pixel high images.I hope this helps the seller in the future.
5,Wanna kill all vegetation and animal life within a hundred mile radius?,"Buy this CD and play it at the loudest volume your speakers will go. Nothing, not Motorhead, not Twisted Sister, not Judas Priest, not the Misfits, not the Ramones, not latter day Dick Dale, NOTHING is louder than this album. Wendy may be gone, but WOW lives on.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
3,If you like KISS you'll like this. If you cant stand KISS...,"Im rating this three stars in an attempt to be neutral. This album is , I'd say, exactly what it attempts to be. As far as my personal tastes go I wouldn't take a leak on this album if was on fire next to a 50ft stack of hundred dollar bills. If you think KISS makes good music then you need to buy this album for all the reasons better explained by most anyone who gave this a five. This album ----> IS NOT PUNK <----- and thats o.k. as long as you know that ahead of time. Sorry to all the KISS fans now looking to stomp my head in their 16"" platform leather combat boots. Im really just trying scare off the punk leaning plasmatics fans from wasting any money on this."
4,A reasonable guide to chopping tops.,"This is an interesting book.It shows a wide variety of vehicles being chopped.Its a good guide on how to perform this body modification.The book also guides you in not going overboard on a top chop.One interesting point I like is it shows you how to put a later 1960's roof onto a 1950's car,and it looks superb.Havent seen that idea before.There's enough information on how to in this book but not a complete step by step guide.It will help though.Worth considering and good value for the price."
2,Get rid of the collets,Forget about collets and nuts. Spend the extra few bucks and get a keyless chuck. You don't need to fumble around trying to find the right collet; the keyless chuck works just like a drill chuck - it opens / closes to the correct size without changing the collet.
1,I Agree with the Majority...,"This is a nice looking vacuum but it does not have any suction (I bought mine at another chain store a couple of years ago, not on amazon). I just now tried to vacuum the interior of my car and it did nothing! I am about ready to give it away. Just bought something else to replace it. Save your money, and don't buy this product."
1,Shark Vac EP724-WORST VACUUM AVAILABLE,"We have purchased the EP724 and have had numerous problems...1. The floor attachments stopped working after several months.2. Overheating, so the machine shuts off.3. The tube continually gets clogged.4. The website given to us by Bed, Bath & Beyond (sharkvac.com) is not an actual website to purchase new items.5. Availability of replacement parts is non-existent.6. Service is unavailable, unless you want to pay an arm and a leg (for a $99 vacuum...hmmmm).7. Short cord.8. Small canister...we have a dog and a child...so a small canister that blows the dirt around when you open the machine is not what I would consider a good idea.9. Seemingly we are not the only ones who think the Shark Vac is a waste of $99...as another brilliant reviewer so eloquently wrote...""buyer be aware!""ONCE AGAIN...BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Umm...a vacuum should pick stuff up -- not spit it out!,This vacuum picks up SOME stuff. It also spits back out a great deal. So you never actually get your carpet clean. I have had it less than a year and I hate it. I always hope it will just completely shut down so I can feel better about replacing it so soon. And the hose gets clogged really easily. You spend more time trying to make it work than getting any cleaning done. The worst part is that Shark products are not cheap. They are more expensive than a lot of reliable brands and yet Shark products get terrible reviews.
1,Poor design,"Yesterday I bought a used Shark EP724. The brush needed cleaning, which took over an hour to take apart--the only effective way to clean it--clean, and put back together. In doing that, it became clear that suction was not going to cause the roller to spin; the design was too chintzy for that. What I didn't realize was that the unfunctioning mechanism would prevent most suction from even reaching the carpet. But it did. This wasn't the result of something being broken, just the result of a really poor design. BTW, the manual suggests buying each of three filters at least twice a year."
1,"No Suction, waste of money","Don't buy this vac.I bought it hoping that at this price I'll get some value but it has very weak suction even when it's new.It can't lift cat hair from a rug, or regular dust, or even ""dust balls"" from the floor when directly pointed at them...I stopped using it several months ago and since then has not vacuumed my apartment; it's about time so I'm currently looking for a replacement and will buy a Rigid wet/dry vacuum (for same or lower cost) which Amazon doesn't sell from some reason."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this vacuum cleaner about six months ago and used it only occasionally. Just last week, the machine broke down and would not start again. After surfing the web for warranty information, I realized that I am not the only one stuck with a broken Shark. The quality of the brand is spotty, to say the best. Now I am in the process of getting it repaired and the shipping costs along will cost over $40 (two-way, Yes the manufacturer will have you pay for return shipping as well). What a hassle for a machine that costs $99. Buyer be aware!"
5,this vacuum ROCKS!!,"I am a grad student of architecture which means I basically have no time for anything but studying... I had not vacuumed in 2 years and when my dad heard this he gave me this vacuum. I LOVE IT!! it sucks it all up and I love the fact that it is low maintenance; that you don't have to go buy bags, because I would rather not vacuum than go buy any replacements"
1,Deceived,"Wow, I loved this vacuum at first. I have only had it for about two months and it already hardly works. The floor attachment works alright. However, the air driven turbo brush seems to have no turbo to it. I have tried everything cleaning it, checking for clogs. But it just seems to have become useless. The only thing the vacuum is good for with the carpets is making the little lines over the dirtiness so it looks like i vacuumed. And it's great at making my back and head ache. I would not recommend.I am very disappointed and feel deceived by the advertising and first couple uses."
3,Euro-Pro Shark Bagless Cyclonic Canister EP724,"The Euro-Pro Shark EP 724 is a marvel with powerful cleaning action. I have nothing but high marks for it except for the onboard tools which are hard to access and are rather cheaply made. My BIG COMPLAINT, though is trying to get the filters for the thing. What a runaround. You call the customer service number on the booklet and they refer you to another one which gives a constant busy signal (for two days). Finally I had to call their toll number in St. Laurent, QC, Canada. Their website is useless for ordering the filter system. Because of poor customer support for this item, I will never buy a Euro-Pro product again, although the machine itself is wonderful. What a pity."
3,Excellent vacuum for $100,"This vacuum is light, easy to use and picks up tons of dirt you never knew was still in your carpet. Cleaning it out is a bit messy and you have to clean and rinse the filters. If this is not for you, get another brand with a bag, but I don't think you will find anything that even comes close to the cleaning power of this unit for anywhere near $100. So- if you need big power and you don't want to spend $350+, this is an excellent choice."
1,Frustrating waste of time,"We've spent more money buying replacement hoses and parts for this vacuum than we spent buying it in the first place. The electric connection to the carpet sweeper head is incredibly sensitive. We've had to contort and bend the thing into all sorts of positions, just to get it to run. As others have noted, the suction is terrible. You can be looking at a piece of lint, run the vacuum right over it, and nothing happens. DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!"
1,A Piece of junk,"This vacuum is terrible. The floor attachments suck. One of them attaches to the hose at the wrong angle for a normal bipedal human so I have to crouch down to use it. Emptying it is a nightmare. I have allergies so I can't even do it, I have to wait for my husband to come home. The filter constantly clogs up and has to be cleaned; a process that even makes my cat sneeze.After a year it has also lost a lot of suction power.Don't buy it. Spend more on a better quality machine then you won't be replacing it a year later."
3,A decent vacuum,"This is a fine vacuum for the price. I've had mine over a year in a house with three cats. It does get clogged occasionally, especially the brush attachment and the tube. But a little routine cleaning takes care of things and gets it back to normal.As for the filters, please do not listen to the lazy people who can't do a little legwork and find replacements. A well maintained filter (washed in water every 3-4 months) should last over a year. While Amazon doesn't seem to carry replacements, they are available at Bed Bath & Beyond's website and I've been lucky to find them in the store near me. Buy two and you should be okay for the lifetime of this vacuum. Also, someone here said that sharkvac.com isn't a valid website, but they're wrong - you can also buy replacement filters through that site as well.In all, this seems to be a dependable vacuum that is reasonably priced."
1,Vacuum cleaner arrived filthy with hair and dirt and dust balls,"This is not a review of the vacuum cleaner since we didn't even try it but was appalled by the used condition it arrived in! It is certainly a review of Amazon's quality control of shipping used items as new! It was a disgusting dirty mess and was was sent back immediately. I've bought many items from Amazon in the past, but from now on I'll stick to books."
3,The Acts from a Different Perspective,"Rocco Errico takes the Acts of the Apostles and provides a different perspective on the language that is derived from Near Eastern thought and idomatic usage. Largely borrowing from the late George Lamsa's notes, Errico weaves an interesting take that is both reasonable and plausible for anyone open to discovery. This book is not scholarly and written in layman's language so it is not all that hard to digest.This book takes some of the more traditionally difficult phrases from the Bible and provides surprisingly simple solutions to many of problems that are often responded to with forced interpretations that arise from a lack of understanding of the original context.In the spirit of Talmudic tought, all interpretations are valid unless conclusively proven otherwise. While this means that one should consider different perspectives, it does not mean to focus solely upon one. In other words; read this view consider the context and make up your own mind."
1,I'm sorry,"I'm really sorry, but as a fiddle player, and also a records collector, I found this recording very amateur, violinists need certainly much better performers for pieces we study, once was available a record of these studies made by Shumsky, IT WAS A GREAT PERFORMANCE, and encouraged us very well, buy it if you just want to get an idea of how it should sound, but just take it as an idea, because also I found many wrong notes in entonation."
2,Boring,"I buyed because i'm studying this pieces, nothing else. I think The Rode Caprices are purelly studying pieces and don't have the necesary emotion for make a recording. It sound so mechanical, monotonous and no original. Maybe with a better performer the result would be another. Rode was a great violinist but talking about composition there is nothing to admire"
4,LOVE THESE SHOULDER PADS,"SINCE I DON'T HAVE NICE SQUARE SHOULDERS, THESE PADS HELP FILL OUT THE SHOULDERS IN BLOUSES AND DRESSES TO GIVE MY UPPER BODY MOREDEFINITION. WILL ABSOULUTELY BUY THESE AGAIN"
2,Foam shoulder pads,"When ordering, I was looking for the Kathleen Kirkwood brand. I saw Lauren Silva and it looked like Kathleen Kirkwood was no longer available, so I tried the Lauren Silva brand. I like to 'see' what I am purchasing, especially a product such as this. I was very disappointed, first of all because the foam flap underneath that holds the pad to the bra strap tears easily. I have barely any shoulders and need pads in all I wear. They didn't slip down the shoulder as easily as some, but the ease of tearing is just too much, as I only got 2 wearings out of them-----and for $9.00 per pair. I ordered 2 pr. When I paid for shipping the 2 pr came delivered for $22.99. This is a very high price to pay for wearing 2 pr of shoulder pads a total of 4 times!!! I would like to find the Kathleen Kirkwood brand again, which has a velcro tab that is underneath the shoulderpad and attaches to the bra strap. I have gotten VERY much use out of them."
2,Not Worth It,"I give this product 2 points because the shape was just right-- added enough shape to make a difference in your clothing, but not so huge that it made you appear to have ""football"" shoulders. The problem is-- as I was removing them, one of them tore completely in half. I was not being rough with them or anything, and although I realize it's just foam, the foam material should have been made stronger. They're not exactly cheap for some pads to sit on your shoulders, and they should have been made out of more durable material."
2,Chunky and cheap,"I purchased these along with one other pair from Lauren Silva, which I've also reviewed. I found both to be flimsy, cheap, bulky and absolutely not worth the price. The flap carved from the foam itself, and intended to latch onto the bra strap, is thin, shallow and likely to rip after minimal use. These went right back into the package for return - what a waste of time and effort. ""Steer clear"" is my personal advice."
1,poor quality,Very thin flimsy flap. Tore on the first wearing. I would not recommend this product on the contrary.
1,still waiting,I was sent an email last week to review this item but in all honesty at this point its a 'not happy' response because I'm still waiting for them to arrive.
1,These bits break real fast,"I started to use these bits for removing the grout on the tile above the bathtub. The bit worked fine for awhile, then it broke. I purchased several more of the 1/16"" bit and even tried the larger one. They heat up and break. They are not cheap to replace. I found better bits at leakyshower.com for a fraction of the price. The dremel bits work, yet are not worth the cost. Maybe next time I'll just scape out the grout by hand."
3,Grout Drill Bit,"We are currently in the process of degrouting bathrooms as part of a large business project. The bits work great with newly grouted walls and last a good amount of time. However, when degrouting in an older bathroom if you hit some larger granulated grout because they cannot take the tension they snap off and now you have to replace it.Have only been able to purchase in 1-per-package which isn't cost effective at 11.00/piece. On average we are using 2-3 bits per bathroom -- after 44 bathrooms you can figure out the cost!!!"
2,"Broke, & Broke again",This bit cuts very quickly at first but breaks rapidly. This works fine to replace a broken tile or two but isn't for a big job by any means.
3,Get the thicker bit,"Dremel makes a 1/8"" thick bit. It's a lot sturdier and addresses the problem mentioned above."
2,Dulls out after about 12 inches of grout,These bits work well for a few tiles then get dull. Not a good solution if you have a lot of grout to remove.
2,Too hard.,This is a very hard book to get into. I am a christian but am finding every second word about God a little too much. I just want to read the book. As a consequence I have only read 2 chapters.
5,Good summarization of attachment problems,"This book is well written. It is an excellent summarization of prior attachment work (Bowlby, etc.). In addition, this book offers some pretty practical strategies for attending to your particular attachment style. This is a useful tool for anyone (counseling professionals and not)...especially for those who are interested in enhancing their personal relationships."
5,A Must Read!,"If you really want to see yourself in the REAL light, this is a must read. I saw things in my life as well as the relationships around me. It gave me a clear understanding of why I act and do the things I do as well as people around me. In the past 2 years I have had some major things happen in my family and relationship. I feel this book has helped me in seeing the real picture in front of me and has helped in my decision making for the better.Warning! You will see yourself in a different light! If you truly want a change and head in a new better direction, this is a great start."
5,Great car!!,We ordered this for Christmas for my 4 year old daughter. She LOVES it. The frame is made of medal and is very durable. This will be one that will be past down to other children in our family as she outgrows it. We are VERY pleased with it and the price made it even more appealing.
3,spend a little more for rubber tires,"I bought this car for my 4 year old daughter and nephew. It was really easy to assemble. The seat is adjustable so even my 7 year old son can fit and we can push our 2 year old nephew.Disadvantage is that the tires aren't rubber, they are plastic so they won't hold up as well and aren't as easy to pedal.It's very durable and I'd probably purchase it again, just don't be disappointed in the tires."
1,Ouch,"This dictionary sucks. I bought it last summer and it did me little good. The definitions are usually only one word, the max being 3. They lump all of the translations together, so you kinda just pick and choose with no real idea of the difference between homonyms. There's no way to actually look up Kanji but you can search with them (the only plus), however, some Kanji aren't listed under the proper radical, and you must search through lists and lists of Kanji by stroke order. I highly recommend the Canon G50. Although it is expensive, it contains extensive definitions of hundreds of thousands of words, as well as an extensive Kanji dictionary (however, Kanji definitions, meanings, etc are all written in Kana). The G50 comes with an English manual and you can switch it to an English interface so it's perfect for English speakers."
5,Harry Potter's Magical World,"If i put five stars to this game, it's because:1) I love the world of Harry Potter2) The musics are great3) The graphisms are really good4) The story is perfectly folowed5) I will play it again and again, i can't stop !!I think it's enought to put 5 stars on this game."
4,Wait can you see anything?,Overall this game is fine. The only comment that I would like to tell people who are considering to buy this game is that the graphics are very dark. You need a really bright light or a really good clip on light.
1,Not pleased,"This game was very frusterating! The lighting for the game was very bad. I could barely see the screen. I even had a gameboy light. And beacuse of the bad lighting, i would fall into pits often and have to start back at the begining. I don't reccomend this product. Get the computer version instead. It's a lot easier!"
2,Not all that great.,"I got the game for Christmas, and it sort of dissapointed me that the game was not very challenging. I know, short review... short game. :) Save some money ans get Tony Hawk on Game Boy Advanced."
1,Not very fun,"The first two classes are kind-of fun, but the third one (Hagrad's hut) is very frustrating. The instructions don't really help at all. You can't even explore the castle because the doors only open when you're on that class."
2,A Frustrating Game,I would not buy this game again. I was exited when I heard that there was a Harry Potter game for GBA. But I am very disapointed with this game. First you have to find your way to Defence Against the Dark Arts class. Then you have to learn Flippendo and collect your 5 golden stars. After that you have to collect 6 glass viles for Potions class. And then you have to find your way to Hagrid's Hut to collect Dittany for Potions. That's where all my friends and I are stuck!!!!!! Don't waste your moolah!!!
1,Adults stay away,"This is a tedious game for adult gamers. The graphics is cheap, and the challenges -- which are the crust of the game -- are boring. Kids and HP die-hards may enjoy some elements of the game, but I was hoping for something more fun. Very disappointed."
5,PLEASE! NO MORE!,"I used to like Harry Potter! But after I played this game, I felt like disowning myself! ""Why?"" I asked myself as playing this game. ""Why am I here playing this game!?!?!"" The question would be soon answered. I was stupid. That's when I felt like going to school and getting an education. The only good thing about it is the backround. I always wondered what the school looked like and the first five minutes seeing it was great! Then I got bored. It was like a poor man's house! Every room was the same! But I gave it five stars...Unfortunately...I couldn't stop playing it and to this day, I still am. So who ever made this game, I tip my hat to. You did what you had to do in this world. Thanks for the game!"
2,Where Do They Come Up With It?,"Although this game is similar to the movie and book in several aspects, it becomes annoying and frustrating with several challenges and puzzles, one after another. It poorly simulates the book, and is easily beat.Many of the challenges are pointless. In most of the game, you have to explore a garden to find ingredients to a potion. Sounds easy, right? Well, you have to beat trolls, destroy spiky bushes, and find things like flowers, worms, and weeds. Although the plot of the game is to find out the secret of the Stone or whatever, the majority of the game is spent finding parts to this potion. You know what you get after finding the pieces? ""Good job"".Too much of the game is spent on the little parts of the game.Would I spend $... to buy this game? Sure, to hit it with a hammer."
3,"Fun Game, Too Challenging...","I am 14 years old and find this game challenging and I have no idea how the creators expect a young child to play this game!It is filled with puzzles and annoying trolls you have to hit. Plis it's not even as if you can just go fly on your broom. You go from class to class learning spells, to sneaking out and night getting points deducted when a teacher catches you, and finally you can fly on your broom which is immensly hard to steer.The game is fun though after the frustration factor. The graphics are good and it follows the movie story line well. One piece of advice, when collected worms, have them follow you behind Hagrid for him to collect them!"
3,Entertaining,"There are few games that can hold my attention for long. Though I agree that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for Gameboy Advance is easy, I'm inexplicably addicted to it. The puzzles are not particularly challenging, per se, but it makes you feel good when you can actually SOLVE them at all, unlike other games where you're stumped for days.It's an easy, lighthearted game that's good for passing your time with -- and the graphics make great eyecandy too."
3,Fun but not satisfied,"Harry Potter was a great game the first and almost the second time you played it. The music was okay, but I would have liked it if they got a little more into detail with the game. I would have liked if the game saved automically, it was annoying when you had to turn off the game when you had gotten so far, and not collected a save book, and then you had to start all over. In conclusion, Harry Potter, is for somewhat younger children."
2,To Hard and Frustrating,"The game is to hard & frustrating in some areas. Makes You want to destroy it!!! Only fun in certain areas, and you can hardly figure out what to do."
1,This is a game you should keep away from.,"This game is the most horrible one I've played which means it pretty much STINKS. The reasons are it is way too overpriced for something you can beat in an hour, the graphics are like Genesis' and last of all the gameplay and sound stunk! Put this game on your keep away from list."
1,Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone,This game is frustrating and extremely annoying. My twelve yo did not even want to bother with it after a few tries. Not worth the money or the time.
3,"gameboy advance, harry potter, hagrid's hut",PLEASE HELP!! my son is stuck! does anybody know how to get to hagrid's hut?
2,Not what I expected....,"And I don't mean that in a good way. I was looking forward to getting this game for Christmas, but I soon learned it wasn't worth the money. I suppose some of it was slightly enjoyable, for example, I liked to flying thing at the beginnig. But that's about it.Maybe if you are a bit younger like 12 and under, but I'm 14 and just don't find it thrilling (sorry about my attempt at big words).To sum it up, I regret getting this game. But it's your choice."
3,eH...don't waste your money...,"i bought this game, and i'm an avid fan of Harry potter, but i was really disappointed. it's a really tough game to beat, and it's quite frustrating: translation: save your pocket money."
3,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Review (for GBA),"For Harry Potter fans, it's the greatest game ever made for a game boy advanced. You can cast spells, meet fellow classmates, explore Hogwarts Castle, and go on missions given to you by the teachers. For others, it may not seem so appealing. I've lowered my rating of the game because of its difficulty. The game is quite challenging."
4,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I don't own this game but my friend does. It is so cool the first time I played it I did'nt wont to stop. I woke up at 4:30 am to play the game and I did'nt stop till 5:00 pm. It is so great by the game it is the best!
4,Uhh..,"Its a cool game, but I was very dissapointed with it. Its so..frustrating. Naturally, video games are supposed to be challenging, but this game just gets on my nerves. One mistake, and you have to start all over..."
2,I choose the wrong item,"For some reason when I asked DS items to be listed, this game boy advance item was in the list, and I did not realised until too late. Amazon searching system failed me."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is more than adequate,"For an old guy with arthritis, this game moves slowly enough to not outrun my lack of manual dexterity. Harry best proceeds with deliberationa and a full search of the area of play. The traps are great although without warning Harry steps into something unexpected, frequently. Do not outrun your line of sight or you might fall off into a pit."
3,Pretty good,"The game itself was fun. You play Quidditch, sneak around the school at night, battle monsters (i.e. mountain trolls), learn spells, collect cards from chocolate frogs, and tackle challenging puzzles, all while trying to earn (and keep) house points.Some bad points were that the game was far too short. I beat in about 5 hours. Also, it was way too dark, especially while sneaking around at night. It was very hard to see what was going on. My last complaint is that it didn't allow very much flexibilty, and it always gave explicit instructions about what to do next."
2,big fat disappointment,"one thing no one's said about the game is how DARK it is. I know the GBA is inherently not very bright, but this game is like impossible to see without really bright light conditions. There is also no plot whatsoever, the point of the game seems to be to find challenge stars and potion ingredients. The 2 stars are for graphics, which are prety smooth, and the spell-learning (although the 1st spell, Flipendo, isn't even in the book or the movie). However, it's HARD. I'm not like a hardcore gamer, and i cannot fathom how people can say the Warioland 4 is easy, or this game. I think this game is really hard, and the dumb thing is, the stupid challenges do not in any way contribute to the already very-wobbly plot. To wrap up, this game is mostly ""busywork,"" has no plot, has ok graphix, cool spells, IS REALLY, REALLY HARD TO SEE CUZ ITS SO DARK, and it really bites unless you are a diehard fan of all things HP."
5,one of the best games out there,"I was really impressed with how they put the game together because I was expecting it to just catch the important events in the story but they even put in the duel with Malfoy.This game is mostly strategy/action game because mostly all you do is go though mazes defeating gnomes,spiked snail,ect. so you can get further.I especially like your fight with the troll,though it did take me a while to figure out how to defeat him.If you like Harry Potter at all you will love the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone game for gameboy advance..."
4,this is a fairy well game... but ...,ok... i though that this was hard at first but... all of a sudden all you know is that you are at the very end! like it's cool...but the grafics are ok.. and the music is normal...all in all i give this item a 4 star cause it's ends really fast!but i would advise it!
3,Need help with the Snape ingredients,"I do like this game except for the fact that I cant find all of the ingredients from Snape. I f you know where to find Dittany, Flobberworm mucus, wigentreebark,and Moly send a review telling me where I can find them. Besides that it is an awsome game. Buy it."
3,fun but needs more challenge.,"This game is real fun but it lacks the challenge part. My friends at school have this game for PC, Gameboy Color and Playstation. When they talk about the game they make it seem really hard. I mean Lord Voldemort is even easy to kill. So my point is if you want a really easy game buy this."
4,Harry Potter - Very good,"harry potter was a very good game to play. i got it for christmas and beat it in about 2 days. it was fun most of the time but sometimes it would get frusterating. flying can be hard so you should read the instructions. sometimes it would get confusing, like at the time when quarrell was trying to capture you at the end, i didn't know what to do but then i stayed away from him and made the spell he was casting hit the poles. then i used the mirror to sheild myself and it worked out fine.it doesn't all the time end up like the game for me slytherin still won at the end for house points because i got caught a lot at night but over all it was still a fun game."
3,Harry Potter?,"This isn't what I wanted out of a HP game. The magic is pretty good, but the adventures are just OK. I'm not saying it's a bad game, it's just not HP. Graphics are cool, though! EA needs to make up on the next game for Xbox, PC, Gammecube, and GBA"
5,got to play!,"The best thing is the game is based on the book. You go to classes and you are Harry Potter in his world. You get picked on by Snape, helped by Hagrid,play quidditch! You actually play quidditch!!! Some parts of the game can be frustating but you just keep trying and you'll get it. This game is a have to play for all Harry Potter fans!"
4,I'm stuck,"I got the game two days ago - I can't put it down!At certain points you have to figure out how to use certain items, because the game doesn't tell you, so It may be difficult for younger kids.The puzzles are cute,but not the most challenging things in the world - but that's to be expected, it is a game for kids ^_^I'm only at the point where you have to collect the 'Flobber Worms' and I'm stuck (...)It is a very addictive game. I haven't been this attached to a game in years."
2,2.5 stars to HP,"This game isn't very good. It takes too little time to complete, is too easy, and where not easy, nearly impossible. unlike most games, there are only certain spaces where you can stop to save, and it doesn't follow the storyline. Example, Madam hooch is the one who puts you on the quiddich team, and you get the book on Nicholas flamel in the restricted section. And you have to make a potion, not choose one for Snape's challenge, and you don't play chess on the chessboard. And to learn a spell, you just move your wand up down left and right! Downright stupid! Not good for gamers under 10. Advance wars is much better as well as F-zero."
3,Fun But Challanging,"The only reason I bought this game is because I'm a hardcore Harry Potter fan and I thought this would fufill my hunger for more. I foud out that it's fun in the begining, heck I couldn't put it down, but once you get to the greenhouse it's impossible!It follows the story well and the graphics are great but if you want a real Harry Potter game get it for Playstation or PC. This game sucks! Now maybe if they came out with a stradegy guide I would consider letting you buy this game with high hopes.ONLY BUY THIS GAME IF YOU REALLY WANT A CHALLANGE"
2,Harry Potter is HARD!,"well, this game is, um, hard. HARD! First you gotta go to potions class, go throuh a huge maze in hagrid's garden, chase malfoy on a broom, then at night sneak down to the third floor. THAT's where i'm stuck since it's HARD! There are too many people on patrol that catch you and it's hard! So, if u like easier games, don't buy this!"
3,disappointment,"I really don't think this game was as good as it could have been, and could get a little monotonous at times if you make so much as one mistake you have to start the whole part over. There aren't quite enough spells but the environment makes up for that. I would recommend this game to those who wan't more of a strategy/ brain game but not to those who have already played the PS2 or gamecube versions."
3,Pretty Fun. Not that much if you are not a fan.,"Harry Potter is an okay game. It gives plenty of playtime, decent music, and detailed graphics. You get to use spells, solve puzzles, and fly. The downside to this game is its not fun if you are not a fan, and the puzzles are real hard. But if you don't mind these things the game is okay."
1,Uses flashy props to turn children's books into toys,"From <a href=""http://www.truceteachers.org/"">Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Children's Entertainment</a>: ""Printed on cardboard, a format meant for baby books, this book comes with four shades of lipstick and rouge with applicator. Pictures and text show girls how to put make-up on Barbie and themselves.""""These 'toy' books undermine the acquisition of reading skills by diverting children's attention from the story line and language. They can make traditional books seem boring when they don't resemble toys and make children expect their books to use gimmicks to entertain."""
1,Too much hype,"This book might be good if you intend showing your dog and entering professional competitions. Even then it's not that great. It scratches the surface for all a lot of topics but nothing in detail. A lot of useless info. such as how odor spreads out from an animal or a human being.I have read Good Dogs Great Owners by Brian Kilcommons and The Art of raising a puppy by The Monks of New Skete. By far, those2 books are much worth the money and time. These 2 books deserve 10 Stars without hesitation.In short, Training your GSD isn't worth the time or money. Get one of the other 2 [ preferably both ]which provide a lot of details,insight and step-by-step instructions.Good luck"
3,Not too much new here,Standard type training steps that are found in most any training manual.Good discussion and history about the breed.I would buy this book again.
2,dissapointed,"While the book has a lot of good advice , IMHO too much is dedicated to specialized training (rescue, work, etc.); basic training tips are mentioned in a minimalistic way. Overall I was dissapointed."
3,A good read,"For a short read on German Shepards, I found this to be a pretty comprehensive book on the selection and training these dogs. Recommended for anyone contimplating buying one of these dogs and who have never owned one before."
3,It's alright,This book is better used for people who are playing on getting a GSD. Not really for those who already have one. I brought this book to help with my dogs training. While it did have lots of good info it didn't help much with the training so I can't recommend it.
5,ATPH: The Epitome of Rock-N-Roll.,"This CD is so amazing that I don't even know where to start. The progression of the band's work suggests that ""Creature"" is the album that should launch the band into wider acclaim... but we've yet to see it. I can't express the range of emotion that ""Creature"" conjures. The tracks ""White Horses"" and ""If God Were Caught"" seem quite possibly the band's most emotionally-charged songs. The CD includes an mp3 video for ""White Horses"" which highlights the band's live performance... which is of course great for those who have not had the chance to see this band live- one of THEE best live acts one will experience.It's hard to choose favorite tracks from ""Creature"" since all of them are so beautiful in their own way, although honorable mention goes to ""White Horses"", ""If God Were Caught"", ""Hurricane"", ""Kissed Adonis"", and ""Live With a Ghost"".All The Pretty Horses are a true rock-n-roll band, enough said."
4,Country Legend among Country Stars,"There's not a lot of recordings of Tommy Collins. This would have to be one of the best ones that I know of. He was quite an accomplished song writer & is known by almost all Country Artists (Songwriters & Singers). It's a shame that not more recordings were made of his works. It would be nice to have a collection of all of the songs that he wrote sung by him, but I guess nobody thought of that. If you're a Country Music Fan, this album should definitely be in your collection."
5,Casio AD-5MR Keyboard AC Power Adapter,Came pre-packaged and has worked wonderfully with the keyboard. Been playing with it everyday since I ordered it! Price was real nice considering the music store I purchased the keyboard was trying to sell me the same thing with inferior headphones and a pedal for over twice the amount.
2,Exposed wires,"I've been using this charger for a week or so now and have been happy with it, until I noticed that the rubber casing is disconnected near the end that plugs into the wall, and it looks like someone had cut it. I don't expect it will be working for much longer unless I take extreme care for it and wrap some electrical tape over the exposed part which is unfortunate."
5,Worked perfectly.,"Haven't had any problems after about 6 months. Works, fits well, no issues whatsoever. Worth the money.Very good buy."
1,Wrong adapter pictured for keyboard,"As the last reviewer wrote, we also ordered the adapter to go along with the keyboard we ordered and held both items until Christmas. The adapter was not the proper adapter for the keyboard as pictured."
1,wrong AC adapter,"When I ordered the Casio SA-67 keyboard on 11/05/02, I also ordered the Casio AD-5UL AC adapter at your recommedation, along with other items. I held the items till Christmas for our grandson when we were disapointed to find that the plug on the AD-5UL adapter was too large for the DC7.5V jack on the electronic keyboard. The keyboard user's guide clearly specifies the model AD-1 as the only AC adaptor to be used with the SA-67 keyboard."
4,Perfect replacement,Lost the original charger for my Casio keyboard. This works just fine. Wish it was made in America. Too many jobs lost because of products like this.
1,It fits but...,"Ok, so it fits as advertised. I did not appreciate the fact, that to make it work safely, I had to wrap a bare wire with electrician tape. That is really below expectations."
1,AC Adapter,I purchased this for my Roku. The original AC Adapter wire was frayed and it kept cutting out. Unfortunately we had to return this adapter because it was too small to plug in to the Roku HD unit.
1,Under Review...,"We ordered this adapter for a Casio CTK-2300 Keyboard. Contrary to the product details, it works for all Casio CTK keyboards, it does not fit the adapter and is the wrong polarity. Amazon is working on this and I am currently waiting on a return label / credit."
2,Does not work with Casio CT-640 Keyboards,"I bought this for use with my Casio CT-640 Keyboard (an old model). This does not work with this model, and I was disappointed and out of $$ for the shipping charges (both ways)!"
5,Casio AC Power Adapter,"I was pleasntly surprised to find this adapter being supplied by Amazon online. THE SHOOPING EXPERIENCE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY EASER. THE DECRIPTION OF THE DEVICE, THE FAST SHIPPING WERE AS EXPECTED. The power supply arrived as stated and the process as stated was flwless. Thanks for the facilitation and coordination."
5,Casio adapter,"This was exactly what we needed, at a terrific price, as well as great service. Would definitely buy from this seller again."
5,Just what I needed,"I bought a Casio Lk-200s from a thrift shop for 6 bucks. Unfortunately the power transformer was missing. I ordered this product as the users manual specified, and it works great. No complaints."
1,didn't work,We have an old casio keyboard that we could not find the adapter for. It works with batteries but that can get expensive. I tracked down the adapter that it called for but it did not work using it. Only works with the batteries. The problem may be inside the keyboard itself.
4,Le gut oté,"very good noise, we found the nature of the Reunion Island. A very good and moving album who speak about the life of the island"
2,dream on,"a good story by Lebbon, one by Campbell. otherwise completely uninteresting. a lot of sentimental stories by different authors. almost strangely bad stories. i am giving it 2 stars for the research around halloween."
2,Yaaa.........NO,"Very dissapointed in this anthology. Its more a proffessor-ship style of stories, none really very scary. I kept losing my attention on which story I had been reading- it took me 3 years to complete this book, which is horrible as I am a voracious reader! yes, they're all about Halloween-which we are LURED to think will be frightning.... but some are just rambling tales that end suddenly, leaving one to wonder ""and , so, ummm.?"" There were a few famous Author remembrances of Halloween, which were whimsical and slightly interesting,but NONE were the least bit frightning. Not at all what I expected, but ok I guess if theres nothing else in the house to read."
3,"F. Paul Wilson's ""Buckets""","There are a few good stories in this huge book, but F. Paul Wilson's ""Buckets"" was one of the crudest, artless, most despicable things I've ever read.If the author had just pulled the narrative around to a thought-provoking twist at the end he might have justified the space for his words. He might have held me.Instead it was a blunt, vulgar and utterly predictable diatribe on the subject of abortion.The editors should ""D&C;"" this pornography out of the book, put it in a bucket of blood and mail it back to this moralizing blowhard."
2,Where is the support,"So I buy this vacuum an,initially, it is all I could want it to be. Powerful an easy to use. Then the day comes when I need a new filter.I have spend hours in search of a simple filter. I even went to the company site and was told i would have to wait 6 weeks. Then I went to a local shop. The owner just laughed and told me that he would not even try to order the filters, ""as it was a waste of time."" I then found [...] and they had the correct filter on their website...so i ordered 4 of them and sat back and waited...and waited and then received an e-mail from them admitting to great difficulty finding these filters.If you are going to buY this vacuum check to see if you run into the same problems that I did. The number that you need for the filter is EP035.My vacuum is now nonfunctionalI couldn't even find the filter at amazon"
5,Europro Shark hand held vacuum,"This is a great hand held vacuum. It has a long cord which I like. It is powerful and cleans well. It is easy to use on steps and is lightweight. It has to be cleaned after each use which is somewhat of a disadvantage, but considering how well it works that is a small chore. I also purchased two for gifts, recommended it to a friend and she had me order her one because it cleans cat and dog hair very well."
3,"Good suction, but noisy","I got this vaccum after reviewing a lot of similar vaccums on Amazon.com and learning this had good suction comapred to a full vaccum.I needed just one like this portable and powerful. This vaccum cleaner satisfies the needs.Whats a lil bad is its very noisy, but guess thats bcos you use it closer to ur ears comapred to a full vaccum cleaner and it gets heated very quickly and u can feel the heat near you.Plus I find the attachments given dont go into small places I would like to clean like window corners or a thin long rim.Overall a great cleaner for house hold items, beds, sofas, cars and small areas on floor if theres a spillage."
2,Poor negative pressure,"I purchased this about 1 year ago and it's only taking up space in my house. It has very poor suction on carpeting. Works O.K. on hardwood floors but then again most of these will. I expected better force. The small openning may look ""cool"" but it doesn't allow for wide enough sweeping area and I find myself going over the same area again and again. Also, the charging holder is a little harder to place the unit in. I would consider look at others first."
4,Great Information,"This is a great book and took a lot of time and research to put together, although it did not help me. It seemed to have more northern than southern information."
4,Three Decades is a Long Time Span,"I purchased this book mostly to help date vintage fabrics from the 1930's, 1940's, 1950's and 1960's. I love the spiral binding. The swatch examples are awesome. The notes on color and styles are helpful. I do feel, however, that lumping 1930 through 1960 photos together with no notes does not really help to date the fabric accurately enough."
3,Quilt fabrics,"This book would be of interest to quilters and those interested in dating quilts. The patterns are listed in colour headings under 20 to 30 year groupings eg 1880-1910 and there are several pages in front of each year grouping with details including the period, textile colours, fabric print styles and quilt styles. The pictures are in colour and the book spiral bound so it will lie flat easily when open - good for making comparisons of quilt material."
4,"Functional and capable, but not perfect","This is a great starter bag. It can hold 2 adult bats, has a shoe compartment plenty big enough for my size 13s, and has a nice side pocket for a wallet, cell phone, etc. The material is durable and the bag looks nice. I also like the mesh separator in the middle so I can keep my balls in one area for easy access. The separator can be removed very easily, as it is only clasped on with buttons.My only gripe with this bag is that it isn't big enough for me. As I said, it's a great starter bag. But for players like me who have 2 or more gloves and 3 or more bats, it just isn't big enough. There is no chance to fit 3 adult bats, even with 2 of them being wood. I knew I was taking a gamble with the size, but I just couldn't pass up the price. I'll use it until it wears out in a couple years and then I'll shell out the $50 for a full size next time. In the mean time, this bag will do just fine."
1,Not durable enough for regular baseball player,"After much searching, my high-school aged son who plays baseball year round liked the features of this bag and bought it. However the bag just doesn't hold up for serious players. I have had to use heavy duty thread to re-attach the zipper twice and to reattach the straps as well. This bag has lasted less than one year. It would probably be fine for seasonal Little League players."
2,rips apart at the seams,this is a great bag for a season or less!i only have two mitts shoes and a bat not much to really stuff the bag the zipper lasted longer than the seams the color options is why i chose this bag to be able to find it out of the crowd of bags. that was the good thing about this bag
5,This Bag is a Great Buy,"I purchased one of these bags for my little league player. For $30, the quality of this product is excellent! It is heavy duty, and although it has only been used several times, it looks like it will last a long time. It can fit one batting helmet, two gloves, water bottles, a pair of shoes, baseball clothing, balls, several bats, gloves, and other smaller items. The batting helmet is a tight fit in the bottom of the bag, but no problem. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Good bag for the price,"Good bag for the price, lots of features such as the built in cleat holder and pockets to stash your gear. Biggest disappointment is that the shoulder strap is not very comfortable. They could have done better on the design as there is very little padding and poorly designed."
3,"Not the best, but good for true fans","Guitar on the Go was Wes' last release on Riverside. This album consists of a few reissued tracks (Missile Blues and Fried Pies from The Wes Montgomery Trio) as well as new tracks from his final Riverside sessions. It seems like it was released as an afterthought, after Riverside had gone defunct. Wes' guitar is hard to hear on most of the new tracks, but Mi Cosa (Unidentified Solo Guitar), the last track on the album, is fantastic and made this album worth purchasing. Recommended for fans who already own most of his other albums. If you are new to Wes I'd recommend The Incredible Jazz Guitar, Smokin' At The Half Note, Boss Guitar, or The Wes Montgomery Trio."
1,Don't buy it,"My device didn't function at all. Seems like a very low quality-assurance. Similar device I saw in action had a limited set of frequencies, so it couldn't find a free frequency to use without a background noise."
4,A Great Product for the Price,I bought this specifically to use for camping (along with an iPod and a hand-crank radio) and this thing works like a champion! I can listen to dead shows at superior fm quality in the middle of the wilderness...it's a good product!
4,Great for the price!,"I love this thing. I use it all the time when I'm in my car and it works great. Which is strange given how much it costs. After looking at many different transmitters I decided to take a chance and go with this one. My dad has one that he paid 40 bucks for and this one works better than the $40 one. The only complaint I would really have is the battery life is fairly short but not much shorter than on any other fm transmitter I've seen, and on some radios there is a buzzing in the background that you cant get rid of, but it is well worth it if you live in a small town with little radio stations around like I do."
1,Blech!!,"Worthless. ""Worked"" less than 3 minutes, tho' all I got was hiss. They'd rather send you a new one than accept a return. Expect problems there - they're ""short-handed""..."
1,Expensive and poor quality for me,"A few months ago I was looking for a gadget could help me to hear my favorite music on my car for long trips, so I decided to buy this peace, then while I was waiting for the delivery I had an urgent trip so I decided to buy another one more simple and chep. When it arrived I was very disappointed because it was bigger, uggly and it has a poorest quality than the first one I had bought!!! But the worst thing was when I placed my negative review on Amazon, someone from the shop sent to me an email requesting to remove my review! So I must expose what happen, you are judge."
4,Very nice device- battery usage is a little high.,Very nice little device- I especially liked the custom freq binary toggle switches. I think the little LED in the front sucks up battery life a little more then I would like. But its worth it just to have some nice music.
3,Better than Nothing,"I bought this for $7 and for the price, it's certainly not a bad FM Transmitter. It's made out of a light, cheap plastic and the tiny switches are somewhat of a hassle (fingernails are a must), but when you're lucky and traffic isn't bad, you're likely to get a pretty clear, uninterrupted signal and sound quality. I bought a $17 FM transmitter from Target and it never got half the signal this one does.So if you find it somewhere particularly cheap and you're in the market for a basic, anything-will-do transmitter, I would go for it. It's better than nothing."
2,problems,i still don't know where i can find the boat?they gace me just a few information...they said the boat is hiding somewhere..but i still can't find it!and there just only two kind of the animals that i can buy from the farm ove the other island!only cows and horses!everytime i tried to buy some chickens and sheeps!is anybody can tell me what is going on?
4,I liked this gme!!,"This game is pretty neat!! You can have 8 horse of different colors, 8 cows of different colors, 8 chickens (tho they are ALL white they change gold after a while!) and eight sheep of all the same color tho... But you can get married have two kids ( a boy first and then a girl ) you can tell when shes going to be pregnant when she says she has a dream about a stork. then he announces she is gonna be pregnant a few days after the dream!! Then she cant work for two months.. :( I have never played the old ones but this one is great!! It gets a lil boring after you play it five times and then it says like ""oh sorry were gonna have to sell the farm!!!"" i got SO mad but than like i tried again and it gets better every time! You make more money being the girl but if you get pregnant than you cant play and you dont have power ups like the boy does....... I LOVED IT!!!"
5,Harvest Moon the coolest game on earth,"Harvest Moon seems like a boring game you think ""oh you just farm"" but its not. You live the life of a farmner and you can buy animals and plants and even raise a family. I played a lot of Harvest Moon games and believe me this one is far the best."
4,Lighthearted Fun,"Mental-pause is a light, fun read. Menopause is not generally a funny subject. However, the author uses humor to help us laugh at ourselves and also shed some insight into the crazy world of night sweats, memory lapse, gray hair, and other such undesirable symptoms of this time of life."
5,A Fly On the Wall. . .,"I'm ashamed to admit that Laura Jensen Walker is a spy. Evidently she has peeped into my life, and the lives of thousands of other women who find themselves on the other side of forty. Thank God we can laugh about it together, and that is exactly what she accomplishes with ""Mentalpause"". ""I'm normal!"" I shouted, after reading Laura's hilarious first chapter. I guess I'm not going crazy after all. I'm simply a bright, maturing woman entering a new season of life called ""Mentalpause"". Thanks, Laura, for the laughs and an honest, humorous look at aging."
5,Who would think mid-life could be funny?,"I never would have thought hot flashes and strange hormones would be funny business--then I read Mentalpause. It gave me pause for thought! Laura has a warm wit that cuts through the saccharine approach to real life issues. Looking at circumstances through Laura's eyes makes me smile at the present (and the future) rather than wishing I had the money to run to the plastic surgeon! This book is well worth the read. It made me laugh until I snorted and when I caught my breath I said, ""Wow! That was deep!"""
2,Laughs?,"I must admit, I am only 34. I am not anywhere in the range of menopause and I was looking for a light, funny read when I downloaded this book (it was free at the time.) I found that I got about 80% through (I really tried, I did!) and just couldn't do it. I did have a few giggles but not what I was expecting. Maybe I am too young and unaware of what is to come to really appreciate the hilarity of it but in my opinion, it wasn't very funny."
4,Slide this one to the chum bucket,"My kids loved playing with this toy. Within an hour of normal use, the bumbers at the end split and the plastic near the end of the slide started to tear. We had a true ""Slip-N-Slide"" that survived most of last summer."
1,Wish I could review It.....,"As soon as I hooked up the hose to the slide, the tube popped and ripped. Terrible."
2,Not for fisherman,"Here's a fishing game that was created by people who obviously know very little about fishing. Good stuff- the graphics are excellent and game play is good. The bad is if you like fishing it's pretty frustrating for a couple reasons. 1)You can't fish the lures, especially the plastics the way they are really fished. Everything is reel in as fast as you can to attract fish. 2) When fishing in a tournament the game targets largemouth, spots and smallmouth. You catch a lot of ""florida bass"" which are not target fish and have to let them go. Florida are largemouth. 3) You can catch snakehead, which looks like a dogfish but is actually an Asian fish (Konami programers?)Anyway at 1/2 off it's not a bad deal, just not accurate."
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"I would strongly recommend not purchasing this product. It arrived less than three weeks ago and it is already beginning to fall apart.There is some flaking of the polarizing screen on the filter. This renders is completely unusuable because it now it adds little shadows that look similiar to dust being on the sensor when I have it on.The filter was either in a case, or on my lens with a lens cap on during all periods in which I wasn't using it. For it to beginning to break down already is just sad. Don't try and save $30, go for a different filter."
1,The 2 rings fall apart easily,"Under normal usage, the circular polarizer rings fall apart easily and now I need to shop for a new one."
2,Great filter but scratches easily,"As at least one other reviewer has written the surface coating scratches easily. I take this hiking and backpacking, and I am VERY cautious with my equipment, but stuff happens. Scratching the filter is my fault but the thing is $82, I'd expect more out of it for that price. I'll just have to spend double the price to get a multi-coated pro series... and looking around further, this is overpriced."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed by the quality of this item. When I received it, the paint they had used on the wedge was flaking off in large areas. Running my finger over other areas removed even more. Could you imagine what would they would look like after actually being worn??!! Needless to say, they are on their way back as I type."
5,One of my favorites,I bought Eastern Peace about 15 yrs ago when it was on cassette tape. I have played it a lot and I wanted to update and get it on cd format or download it.I love the Eastern musical influence in this and the instruments. My favorite track is the Chants of the Ancient Ones but they are all really great. I would recommend this CD to any Steven Halpern fan.
2,Great film - but a major video problem with the DVD,"Life Beyond Earth is a wonderful film. Unfortunately the DVD picture suffers greatly from frequent frame stuttering and staggering - most prominent during the many animation sequences. What I recall as a smooth animated glide through the Eagle Nebula is now more of a bumpy bus ride. It's too bad, because other than that, the picture/color/clarity is greatly improved via my s-video connection, and the dolby surround, though not 5.1, does the soundtrack justice. Whether it's a flaw in the original transfer, or just bad duplication, I do not know, but I've now tested two copies on two different DVD players, and the flaws are consistent... and ohhhh so frequent. It's maddening. I certainly expected better from PBS."
4,Just a picture book - but a good one,"Another gem by Arms and Armour Press, whose style is unfortunately seldom emulated. This is a meat and potatoes book - just pictures and lots of good, detailed, well researched and well written captions. There are also some colour plates of surviving insignia artifacts.Nice broad overview showing the contrasts in uniform and equipment details from 1939 to 1945. It is a pleasure to see someone with actual English language skills writing captions as they flow like good prose should.Photos are a mix of the familiar and the rare, well reproduced and with many interesting details.No real organization to the work, simply a collection of items of interest. Not to be taken as a comprehensive history or uniform guide."
5,A great low-tech toy.,"The scooter came partially assembled, which was great, and the handlebar height adjustment was simple to do. For a three year old, the wide stable platform was perfect. We've bought other Radio Flyer items, and have always been pleased by the quality and longevity."
1,Scooter size and age of child is deceiving,I am very disappointed with this scooter. Maybe ok for a 3 year old but much older than that it's not. Age says 3-7 and that is not correct. I bought this for my 6 y/o and it is way to small for her.
5,Great for kids developing gross motor skills,What I like most about this toy is that it is sturdy and stable. The three wheel design allows for greater balance and control. I bought this for my 5 year old who has some motor challenges and she loves it. The simple color scheme is great because it helps her feel mature (as opposed to similar scooters with preschool cartoon character). She has difficulty riding a bike but likes to play outdoors. This scooter has helped boost her confidence while building her strength and coordination. She enjoys it alot. My 4 year old niece (without motor difficulties) also liked playing with it. Great toy for the price.
4,Cute,My son received this as a Christmas gift when he was 2 yrs. old. Good size to start out w/ and the bell is a big hit. Cute w/ the tassles and I like the fact that the bottom part is wood. Only dislike was that my son likes to ride it in the kitchen (we have a big one) and the wheels don't have any tread on them so it slips on the hardwood floor. Great for anywhere else & I would definitely recommend to others.
4,Seems to be ok,We got this for our son's 4th birthday. He hasn't used it much but seems very durable and I'm sure he'll like it better when he can maneuver it a little better
2,Not tall enough for a seven year old,"I bought this scooter for my granddaughter's 4th birthday. It was just the right size for her, but this was at the tallest setting. I don't think it will last more than a year for her. 7 year old is way past the appropriate size for this one. I was happy with how sturdy it was and it looked nice, but would have preferred it to really grow with the child as the description indicated, at least until age 7 as indicated."
5,very nice scooter,this is great for a young child. my two yr. old learned on it and loves it. rides it in our basement and outside. It has plenty of room for feet.Perfect gift
5,Great toy!,Our three year old sees the big-kid scooters and always wants one and since those are always too big we got him this alternate. He loves it and it's a great size for now and to grow a little!
5,LOVE IT! great FIRST scooter! Get the wooden one!,"We originally bought the plastic version of the Radio Flyer, and I returned it after doing a bit more research. This wooden version is just a few bucks more, and the difference is incredible. The value is great, and the scooter is nicely built. It's durable, it's easy to use, and it's the perfect size for our 3yr old son. The one thing I would fix, if I were able to is the handle bars: they can spin a complete 360 degrees around, and sometimes it's hard for my son to turn.. but he'll get past that with practice. I gave it 5 stars for ""educational value"" because it's helping with his balance and control. We love it!"
2,"Heavy, hard to manoevre; it rots in the basement","Grandma got this for my daughter's 3rd birthday. She was excited to get it, but we have barely used it. It is very heavy and hard for daughter to use. When we attempt to take it out, she rides it for a couple of blocks, then gets tired; then I end up having to schlepp it home. I wish we had the Micro Mini scooter instead, which daughter has tried at friends' houses; much lighter, better scooter; the two wheels at front is a much better design. Worth spending more for a better scooter, if you want it actually to be used."
5,Radio Flyer Little Red Scooter,My son had to have this and he loves it. Perfect for the little ones that are just learning balance.
5,lasts and lasts,"i have given this to my friends daughter after my son using it for a year. Still in great condition. Much better than those plastic ones i've seen in the park. Its doesnt seem to pick up much speed though and slows down quickly but hey, for a first timer.....its good."
3,radio flyer scooter,"we bought this and the razor scooter at the same time for xams gifts. both are nice, but the razor was easier to assemble (although assembly was not hard for either). ride quality of the razor was better probably due to the use of roller blade like wheels on the razor."
3,"Not too sturdy, but newphew loved it!","This was a gift for my nephew for Christmas, he loved it! I think it could have been a bit more sturdy, however for the price, I got what I paid for."
4,The toy who brings friends together!,"Little Red is a nice, fun, durable toy. My grandson, who just turned 2, is having a great time riding his brand new red scooter, ringing the bell all around the house, driving his parents crazy, and demanding them to take him out to the park to ride it, and have fun with his friends. He is having the time of his life, and learning at the same time about safety rules, and being aware about his surroundings."
4,Fun indoors and outdoors,"This was a gift my son recieved recently for Christmas. He was so excited to jump on, which went well for the most part. Once he got the hang of it, being that he had to get his coordination and balance going, he played for quite sometime. It is a little more unsteady than i expected, being that it has the 3rd wheel. The foot plate is a bit narrow, but my son is taller and bigger for his size than most kids his age. I give this toy a thumbs up but wouldn't say it's for kids older than 4-5yrs old, based on average size. Our scooter came practically assembled, and arrived as expected with shipping. Wheels turn easy, steering seems to be a breeze, and the bell is a hit with our son. Got a fabulous price on this scooter by the way, love Amazon!"
2,radio flyer scooter,"I thought this scooter would be ideal for my five year old granddaughter but unfortunately she has hit her ankle on the rear wheel bolt several times which makes her reluctant to use it. Maybe the designers could look at recessing the bolt so that this does not happen. Otherwise, it is well built but this is a major issue."
3,"OK, but cheaper to make your own","These were a good price, and when you get them you can see that they are just poly quilt batting cut (and not really well) to size. When these are beyond washing I'll just trot over to JoAnn's for some batting and cut my own."
1,AN AWKWARD PHONE,"I can say little good about this phone except that it does what any phone can do. The sound adjustment sets up feedback, so bad that I do not use it even though I could use some help. It has been almost impossible for me to put in the pictures so that they stay, the only security is one thin sheet of plastic that can be pressed in over them all. It does not keep the pictures in their places. The instructions are minimal. Maybe if I were skilled at model building and art projects I could figure this thing out. I see the trade name Clarity on advertisements for lots of expensive phones and thought foolishly the name meant that this would be a high quality phone."
4,Dremel Grout Removal Kit,"Worked great and saved me a lot of time, but I found that it worked better without the plastic cover attached. I had really thin grout lines however I think the cover would be great for grout 1/8"" or larger."
1,A completely ineffective tool!,"I purchased this tool thinking that it would be faster than removing grout by hand. But it is not. It is extremely slow even with a full 1/8 inch carbide tip bit - not supplied. The included bit is even smaller. By hand, with a double bladed hand-held small grout saw I was able to remove 1/4 inch grout at a 3 feet per minute pace. With this tool, it takes ten times that.In addition, the plastic base has two notches to guide the tool in the grout joint. But the grout grinds away these notches after about 10 minutes of work.A completely ineffective tool! Sounds like a cool idea but a complete waste of money. Do yourself a favour and don't buy it."
1,Waste of money!,"As mentioned in other reviews, the guide is worthless. With a steady hand and an angled approach, you can do better than with the guide. The bits are close to the same: I have 2 x 2 tiles in my shower. The bits do remove the grout, but they only last for about 6 [2 x 2]tiles each! At $10 each, it would cost less to sledge hammer my floor and put in new tile! I am yet to find a good grout removal tool...next is to look at a product called ""The Grout Grabber."""
2,"small changes would make it much, much more useful","the product is a dark grey (almost black) piece of plastic, designed to hold the cutting tool and keep it from straying off the desired cut line. since it goes over the work area and covers about 70% of the hemisphere, it takes away a lot of the available diffuse natural light, making it difficult to see where one is cutting. as this tool is intented to be an accessory when cutting grout from in-between tiles, there are black-on-black marks to aid the alignement. painting those markers while (for example with an office whiteout pencil) allows a much more precise control of the tool. It is a small change and easy to implement; why doesn't Dremel consider adding two white markings as a feature?use of this accessory makes it very difficult to work in small areas and corners (e.g. where a countertop joins a splashwall)."
1,Save $10 and just buy the bit,"The attachment doesn't keep the bit centered and won't work near corners. The housing has two tabs that are supposed to guide the bit along the grout line. The problem is that the housing is made of cheap plastic so when you tighten it it distorts and causes the bit to be off center. This is only good for very small jobs and they tend to be near corners, so for get this tool. I found that I could easily complete the job freehand. So just buy the bit size that you need and save $10 (or $15 in some stores)."
1,Not built for serious use.,"Like many other reviewers, I picked up this attachment to remove the grout from my shower surround prior to regrouting. The biggest problem is that the attachment deos not keep the bit centered. The plastic guide ""nubs"" wore down to almost nothing before the job was 1/2 done, so most work was basically performed freehand.I did not experience any problems with the bit breaking. Don't force the tool, as with any other dremel work, and it should be fine.Overall I don't reccomend this attachement for more than a few square feet of tile."
2,Bits break too easily,I tried to regrout my tub with this thing. I had to buy 2 replacement bits (for a total of three) and broke both of those and didn't even finish the job. It wouldn't have made me so mad except that the bits cost about $10 each. I followed the directions and still had trouble. A grout saw is still your best bet.
4,Makes sportube easier to transport,The pull handle works better to transport the sportube through an airport than pulling it by the carrying strap.
2,"Good idea, not very strong","We bought this to go with our Sport Tube to carry 2 snowboards and gear for our trip to France... it was a good idea and made carrying our case easier, but it did not hold up. Walking through the bus station, pulling the case up the stairs, the metal clip broke... luckily I was walking behind it and was able to stop it with my shin before it took out a stairful of Frenchies! We will do without the liability next time we use our Sport Tube."
4,Great for all ages,"My 3 year old son and I can both play this.The games are fun, clever and can be played bymy pre-literate boy."
3,Stuck,"At what level do get Incendio Duo or Incendio Tria or where to find it? How do I get past the 'weeds' right after Fluffy? The game is sometimes hard to see, especially the night scenes, the random fights drag the game out. Other than that, the games is actually pretty good and stays along with the story."
3,How do I end this explore Hogwarts in the invisibilty cloak?,"So far the game has been pretty good but i can't seem to get out of this ""explore hogwarts in the cloak thing"" Please help!!"
4,Easier than PC game,"My 9 year old son got this game from his sister. He really likes it. His comment after playing this and also the PC game, was that this is a lot easier to play because he can do it anywhere. The only drawback is that he got it on December 25 and has already solved it!"
2,"not the best,","it was not the best game. it was kinda boring. that is unless you like walking around places that doesn't really have a point to it.it is really boring to just looking for things, nothing really else to do."
3,okay...ive seen better,"This was not a bad game. But beleive me-your using your money on an okay game when you could be playing something interesting like Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons/Ages. You'll spend hours hopelessly wandering dungeons,Hogwarts,and a million other places. The story of the game strays from J.K. Rowling's actual story: like in Gringott's Harry rides in a cart, he doesn't walk around. I bought this game in hopes I'd have the fun I had reading Harry Potter. Boy was I disappointed!It really takes a ton of perserverence, fighting all the impossible battles with powerful creatures that are constantly a step stronger than you. So if you've bought all the better games in the world (quite a few, in my opinion), you're so strong a Harry Potter fan you'd (...) someone who dislikes it, or you're a complete fool and/or (...),buy this game."
1,This Game STINKS!,"I bought this game about 2 years ago. I played it one time and I was DONE!! I never played it again. It has levels that are impossible to get past and its very confusing. It is no fun I STRONGLY advise you not to waste your money. I am in high school and this game is so CONFUSING!! Instead, go buy the book!"
2,Boooooooooooo!,This game stinks:( The wand power is terrible. There is a level that is immpossible to get past. You never get to play quiddich.DON'T BUY THIS
1,okay,This game is the (worst) game that i have ever played!!! I was extremely disappointed and i think you need to get (...)out of here!
3,where is the snakes skin?,"Reading many reviews about the game of Harry Potter on this site, I was wondering why so many people can't find the ingredients of the potion Harry has to make for Sneep. I for myself know from other reviews that the snake's skin can be found in the office of Sneep, near the picture of the snake, but I can't possibly find it. Could this be an error in the some versions of the game? I would like the hear experiences from other people.On general, the game is rather agreable, but not as good as Pokemon and certainly not as good as Zelda (Oracle of Ages and Seasons)."
1,You guys sell faulty products,"i ordered a game and the internal battery was fried, it was a minor mishap but i want to thank you for refunding my purchase. if not for the minor inconvience im sure i would havebeen very happy with the serive this company provides."
3,"It's ok, but it's a little hard","I'm not so good at playing video games, and I stink at this one! It was the first gameboy game I got and I've had this game for 2 years and I still haven't gotten past the 1st level! (i was really close one time though). It's not fun at all for people like me who aren't that good at video games. If you're like me or it's your first time getting a game boy game, I would recomend pac man which will help you in other gameboy games. I am never getting another Harry Potter video game AGAIN!"
4,Good Game,Well this was a very good game. The graphics compared to the other versions are okay but it's a gameboy color! I've played better games but I am not disappointed. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone follows the story line as close as possible with quest after quest after quest! The only thing is did they have to go through a dungeon before they went into the entrance hall? Plus I don't remeber fighting rats and bats and suits of armor. I got it yesterday and I've been playing for about three hours. Non of it is too hard however I understand I'm not that far in the game yet. (...) I reccomend this for beginners and veterans alike plus harry potter fans.Go see the movie! It's really GREAT!!!
4,Lovin it!!,"OK.I absolutely luv this game, but i cant find the boomsalng skin!!!!ITS DRIVING ME KRAZY!!!!I've looked at the pic of the snake & i still can't find it!I press A at the pic & it still wont let me get the boomslang skin!!!!!!!!I am about to kill this game(even tho i luv it)if it duznt let me get that boomslang skin!!!!!!!!!!!!Can anyone help me?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
2,Disgrace to Hogwarts,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played. With horrible graphics and bad sound, I would rather be playing the original Frogger game. The game is O.K. in the begining and in the end it is terrible. Don't buy it."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Ok this game is one of the worst games I have ever purchased. First of all, there is too much reading and animation. You may as well just buy the movie because this is basically it except the grapics are terrible to be honest and you really cannnot tell that Harry Potter is really Harry. Also some of the battles (pokemon anyone?) are very hard and the system that they use to determine if you will win the battle is very odd because every spell is worth something and everytime you use a spell, it deducts some points from you. :( it is really dumb. Though I love Harry Potter, they could have done better on the game."
4,German magazine for mom,My mom has been re-reading her German magazines she brought to America back in 1973. She now has access to some of her favorite German magazines again thru Amazon.She loves it.
1,love calvin hate gospel,calvin simon longtime member of parliament you can hear him on parliament's osmium record along with a few cuts on funkadelic's first album but as the years went on calvin was featured less and less along with the other original members of parliament anyway calvin flound religion nothing against him I respect him but I do hate gospel music but hey can't knock the next man for traveling this path and if anybody wants to be a jesusfreak that's them just don't come at me with religion.
4,SleeveTop Notebook PC Case,"I was looking for a sleeve that would protect my 17"" laptop when I traveled. I didn't purchase the sleeve as a carrying case, I already had a bag. My laptop just barely fits into the sleeve, but that's all I needed. It works fine if you slide the laptop into the sleeve when it is completely zipped up. If you try to zip the sides with the laptop in it it doesn't work as well. But for what I needed it is perfect. Do I wish the sleeve were alittle bigger, of course, but for what I needed I'm quite pleased. I would definitely recommend the sleeve for limited use, but for all the time protection."
3,Wouldn't recommend,"This sewing machine is really expensive for what it does. I found it on Amazon for a lot less, but it really is only good for teaching the fudamentals of the sewing. It does sew pretty good, but the thread kept coming out from the tension disc and then of course the stitches were too loose and I had to fix it for her to sew again. I will get my 7 and 8 year grandchildren to learn to handle the material under the foot and keep their fingers out from under the needle, then buy them a regular small machine that does lockstitch. They need adult supervision anyway, so might as well buy a real machine for $40.00, then this plastic thing. I really wouldn't recommend it, unless you just want to get them use to a sewing machine. Was thinking of sending it back. As you can tell I am very undecided, because I want them to be safe around the machine, but this item is a lot work to sew something even simple like the wrap around skirt."
1,Not worth the price!,"This kid's sewing machine was rated highly by others, but in my opinion, theseALEX Toys Adjustable Two-Speed My Little Sewing Machinecomments must have been made by people who are inexperienced with using a sewing machine. I bought this machine for my 11 year old granddaughter and she (we) had a very difficult time using it. The machine is difficult to thread, the foot peddle is very unresponsive, the fabric has to be pulled through manually (the feeddog does not pull the fabric through as it should) and it is so light that it tips and topples when the thread is being pulled out after sewing. I would NOT recommend this machine. Save your money and buy a mini machine made by a major sewing machine manufacturer. I have returned this machine for a refund."
3,Good except tension,Sewing machine is very good. My 4 yr old can use it under supervision. It is good for learning on.However the bobbin tension is terrible and the top tension is hit & miss.
2,"So far, a disappointment","I purchased this for my 9 year old daughter who wants to learn to sew. I'm a competent sewer so I thought I could use this to teach her. So far, it has been a big disappointment and I am on the verge of returning it. It comes unthreaded very easily - almost every pass we make, it comes unthreaded. This has proven to be a major frustration for my beginning sewer as well as for me."
1,Hugh diasppointment!!,I just received the Alex Sew Fun and when I unpacked it the latch on the cardboard carrying case did not work. It looked very cheap and I did not go any farther to open it completely. I contacted the seller and have it packed and ready to return for credit immediately.It would be worthwhile to see this item at a store before attempting to purchase it on line only to be so very disappointed.
4,Sewing Machine Fun,My daughter likes this product a lot. It is great for new sewers. The only thing I did not like was it has no back stitch making it a pain to pull thru and tie off every seam.
2,Great idea - but broke fast,"I really loved this product in theory, and the 4 times my daughter used it, it worked wonderfully! She loved to sew, and I though we had bought a winner! But when we attempted to change the bobbin thread, the machine would not pick up the bottom thread, even though we followed the instructions to the letter! I sent 4 e-mail to the manufacturer with no response and I'm taking the machine to my local repair shop to see if they can determine the problem with it! Too bad, I really wanted this to be the great toy it had the potential to be."
1,Disappointed,"It doesn't work!!! My grandmother has been sewing her whole life and she couldn't get this machine to work. My daughter is so, so disappointed!"
2,fragile mechanism,"When this machine worked, my daughter loved it. It comes with nice accessories that allow you to start working right out of the box. But it didn't work for long.The bottom bobbin was a pain to re-engage and repeated efforts to grab the thread may have stressed the internal gear mechanism. At one point the needle simply didn't cycle up and down. Eventually, I opened the machines and could see the drive gear had popped up. I pushed it down and it seemed to be fine. Until it disengaged again.After 5 tries of opening up and re-sealing the machine after pushing the drive gear back in place, the plastic threading you drive the screws in began to fray and wear away.I'm ordering this again because it was on sale cheaper than the first purchase and because my daughter got used to using it and I'd rather not start the learning curve over. But 2 purchases of this machine will be my limit."
4,Great first machine for kids!,"My daughter received this for the holidays and loves it! It is easy to use, although she needs my help to thread the needle. Easy for her to manuver. Only complaint is that it doesn't go in reverse to backstitch (as far as I can tell)."
4,Very Pleased,"I ordered this for my 8 year old who is interested in sewing. I got it when the prices dropped from $75 to $45 right after Thanksgiving, so I felt like it was a good deal. My daughter LOVES this little machine. It is basically a smaller (slightly less functional) version of my sewing machine. It doesn't have a light or a reverse lever, but other than that it works ""just like mommy's"" She is learning so much and I'm not worried about her breaking my expensive machine. I'm not sure it would have been worth the original $75, but definitely worth $45."
5,Superb Score!,"Christopher Young has outdone himself with this one! Blending orchestration with choirs singing latin has always been my favorite (when it comes to movie scores) and this has it all. From Introitus (Entrance) 8:28, track one, all the way through to Lux Aeterna (Eternal Light) 6:44, track five, kept me on the edge of my seat! :~) Anyone who loves collecting scores should definitely add this one to their collection as you will not be disappointed!! Here are the track listings:Track 1 - Introitus (Entrance) 8:28 Track 2 - Kyrie Eleison (Lord Have Mercy Upon Us) 11:53 Track 3 - Dies Irae (Day of Wrath) 12:48 Track 4 - Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) 13:22 Track 5 - Lux Aeterna (Eternal Light) 6:44"
4,Great Score!,"This is my first Christopher Young album and it is very good.My favorite tracks are Lux Aeterna (Eternal Light), Angus Dei (Lamb of God) & the end part of Introitus (Entrance). This is the music heard when the ""Child"" rebirths Kim Basinger after she has been shot by the devil in the church. The last track is the best on the entire score. Angus Dei (Lamb of God) is the music when Kim Basinger & the ""Child"" enters a church & lights many candles. This score it really really good. I recommend it to everyone!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"The installation is full of bugs. It partially installs but then you can't run the program. Tried it on Windows 7, Vista and XP with negative results. Removing the bad installation is a nightmare and the support for Resume Maker products is horrible. I can't believe I wasted money on this garbage. If I could rate it a zero I would."
3,Mixed,"The final two chapters of this book make it worthwhile. They contain some of the most profound and insightful words I have ever seen written about anything, anywhere, ever.Most of the rest of the book is a confused, opaque mishmash of largely irrelevant, American-biased New Age junk."
5,Most Informative & Unusual Book I've Ever Read!,"This is the BEST book I have ever read! SHOCKING! Finally, a book that explains the unexplainable! All the pieces of the puzzle are coming together. I have search for answers most my life & found them in this book. Edgar Cayce was one of the greatest men that ever lived."
1,Total Junk,"I am a Mac user so using a USB drive is plug and play. This drive worked for 2 days. In those 2 days I used it to transfer 4 files to another computer. Then it just started UN-mounting itself in the middle of any file transfer I did. I have NEVER used a weaker product, I STRONGLY suggest to stick with companies that specialize in these drives, like Kensington or a few others. Stay FAR away from anything saying PLEOMAX."
1,it broke in 2 weeks,"It worked really well for 2 weeks, and then just stopped working. I dont think i treated it unkindly---i kept it in my pocket next to my cellphone.Maybe if i had treated it more gingerly it would have lasted longer. But what's the point of this form factor if you have to baby it?"
4,Yoga for the beginner,"This is a great book for those who have little time, but a big enthusiasm for Yoga! It teaches you simple exercises for home, the office - just about anywhere!"
1,This Filter Stinks - Literally,"This replacement filter smells putrid. I mean really bad. It is the soft black rubber material that houses the pleated filter, which is different from the hard plastic material in the original 17000 filter. It stunk so bad in two minutes that I had to shut the filter off and return the replacement filter. It took an hour for the smell to go away. I am going to buy the envirocare original replacement instead; there is no use getting a ""permanent"" replacement filter if it smells so bad I can't even stand to run the unt. I'm not kidding - it smelled like burning rubber."
3,"Comprehensive, but not the best release you can get","The first disc (Stiff Records material) is stellar and contains the best of the first two albums in addition to a few singles not on other albums. I found the second disc fairly boring with the exception of a few good tunes, and the third disc is live material and is really hit or miss.Unfortunately, this release only has live versions of 'Love Song' and 'Smash It Up', arguably the band's best two songs. This release also is very sparse on material from The Damned's London Calling--Machine Gun Etiquette.All in all, 'Smash It Up: The Anthology' is a much more concise release that will save you some money and provide you with some essential tracks that this release just doesn't deliver."
2,"Good ideas, but poorly written","This book is written in what I call ""No. 2"" language - abstruse, dense, and unclear. I've been assigned much better textbooks in my college philosophy courses, for instance ""Questions that Matter: An Invitation to Philosophy"" by Ed L. Miller."
1,This shark bites!,"This is, quite possibly, the biggest waste of money ever. I purchased this vacuum after my hard-wood floors were refinished to keep then nice and clean. The first use must be after 24 hours of charging so I waited. The first use was ok. The battery ran out quickly (less than 15 minutes) and the attachment kept falling off. This was the best experience I ever had with this piece 'o junk. Later the battery life got even shorter, the attachments dared me to use them and the attachment with the spinning bristles stopped working altogether. I was so mad! My husband took it apart and was able to get it working again, but it still wouldn't stay attached. I finally solved my problem by buying a new vacuum. I now own one awesome vacuum and one great doorstop. If you are bent on getting this vacuum then you should just mail the money directly to me. You would be far less frustrated. Try the Bissell butler revoloution instead, I did."
1,Used twice doesn't work,"DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE!!!! I recieved this for Christmas and after using it twice, it quit working. I have made a number of calls to the company, but keep getting cut-off. They won't answer my e-mails. The only thing I can find out is on the warranty that says they will repair it for $9.95 plus shipping. I have only used it twice and it only costs $40, and they want $10 plus about $8 to $10 shipping to repair it. All they care about is selling these things and then you are on your own."
5,"JP3: Island Attack is the bomb, baby!","I just bought Jurassic Park 3: Island Attack, and it rocks! It has awesome graphics and the sound is chillingly real. My favorite part is when you encounter a dinosaur because they all require different stratagies to be defeated. I really like the end of the level, because there is usualy a boss, like a T-Rex or a flock of Dilophosaurs. If you are a true JP fan, this game is a must have for all."
4,Island Attack by G.T,"I'm a fan of jurassic park,so I got the game.At first I thoughtit was the best game ever,and I still like it a lot, but the gamegets really hard it will take you about 8 tries to get to a newstage,and you will probably get bored on stages that you have to tried over and over ,but this game this extremly fun in my case."
3,Good,This is a pretty good game. Only harn part is shooting with the gun. Like when you face off with the T-Rex in this one part the wall is caving in because of the T-Rex so you have to shoot him. Anways this is a pretty good game. If you can get it under $15 your good!
1,this game sucks,"This game is one of the worst games i have ever played. Unless you are standing in front of a car light it is almost impossible to see what you are doing. Besides that the only other thing that is stupid about this game is that all you do the whole time bassicaly running away from dinisaurs and the only way to kill them is to be running and bassicly turn around in a split second and shoot a box that kills them unless you are near one of these special little boxes you cant even kill them with your dum flair gun. and to top it all off, i dont know about any one else but i have beaten the 2nd level almost 100 times and every time you beat it, it only gives you 2 options ( save and quit(which it doesnt save or just plan old quit) ..."
5,Powerful Viewpoint,Say Something takes on bullying in school from a powerful perspective. Helping students understand that we all have a role in stopping a bully may help to stem a problem that continues to grow. I recommend this book for any classroom.
4,Almost the same as the original,"I decided to get this newly released version to replace my older book where the scratch and sniff decals are worn out. Everything is the same except in the last few pages- Little bunny is now having chocolate chip cookies instead of the original chocolate mint cookies. Otherwise this is a fun book that I enjoyed as a kid, and know that many other kids will love as well."
1,Beware!,"The integrity of this book is seriously compromised by the new, non-descript, circular stickers. They actually obscure the illustrations that they cover. It makes me sad that what used to be a childhood favorite is now seems so cheaply made. Also, the scents are faint. If you're buying the book for the story and illustrations it is still fun. But if the scratch-n-sniff aspect is an important component(why wouldn't it be?), you'll probably be disappointed."
3,Why did they change things??,"I remembered this book from when I was a child. I remember the scratch n sniff stickers being the shape of the scents. Now to make things cheaper (as all the books and toys do) they replaced the shaped stickers with a 'spot' scratch and sniff sticker. Not nearly as scented as the original.and now the pine cone doesn't ""smell like Christmas"" it ""smells like winter""? and the 'chocolate mint' cookies are now chocolate chip.Still a cute book and story, my 3 yr old daughter loves....but a shame they changed anything in my opinion."
3,Cute story...weak scents,Bought this book in December 2004 and 10 months later NONE of the scent stickers smell anymore. Very disappointing! We didn't overscratch either as can sometimes be the problem. The scents simply wore off. Interesting nobody else here has mentioned the problem though. Wonder if it is just our book???? Wish I could get new stickers!!
2,Scents disappear very quickly,"I bought this book for my 2yr old daughter because I remembered how much I enjoyed books with scents when I was little. She did enjoy the book; however, it quickly lost almost all of the scents over just a couple of months. My daughter is still 2, and just recently started pulling this book out again to read, but we are both disappointed that most of the scents are completely gone now. This book was only gently used, no rough scratching of stickers or anything like that. Only the pine and chocolate chip cookie scents are still there. After smelling each one, she keeps saying ""It's not working. We have to get a new one."" I'm looking around for other books now that will hopefully having lasting scents."
2,Cheap stickers for $9 book,"Cute story, cheap round stickers. Maybe they're there to help the child to know where to scrach but i'm sure there are better, less cheap-looking ways to do it."
4,A Must Have,My mother-in-law bought this book for my daughter when she was 3 years old and she was thrilled to scratch and sniff everyday. It's unique and fun to read. She still has that book at 36 years old. Believe it or not you can still smell most of the fragrances. Now a grandmother for that daughter I was excited to see that it was still in print and purchased it for my only granddaughter. Every toddler will just adore this book.
5,It was a terrific book for little kids to read,Well when a little bunny leaves to play outside. While he wanders around he meets some of his friends and you are able to smell the smells little bunny does. My favorite part is when he meets up with his friend the field mouse who is making strawberry jam. Mmm!
3,Scent Fades Fast,"This book is good for maybe one or two reads and honestly starts to fade that quickly. Some smell is still in there, but it is faint. The DK series of scratch and sniff books can be bought used are worth the search. I wouldn't buy this book again."
2,"Not so ""Smelly""","We recently unpacked my daughter's old scratch n sniff books that had been packed away for future grand children. My 3-year granddaughter was delighted with them. Even though 30 years old some of them still ""smelled"". So I went looking for some new ones. After reading the reviews for ""Little Bunny Follows His News"" I ordered one. Well we were greatly disappointed. The strawberry jam sticker doesn't smell at all and the rest of them are very faint. They will not last 3 months yet alone 30 years!!!!!!!!!! I'm hoping the Halloween book I bought and am keeping for a Halloween treat is better. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it's still a cute story even if the round smelly stickers aren't the greatest!"
2,Very disappointing....,"I was so sad after the purchase of this book. I read many of the reviews stating the scents wear out quickly, but I was hoping that was maybe for older books/purchases. Unfortunately, those reviews were right. Within ONE DAY the scents of the stickers were COMPLETELY GONE! My daughter was so disappointed. She does still enjoy the story, but the whole purpose for buying the book was for the fun of scratch & sniff! :( To be fair, I don't think scratch & sniff stickers are made as well as they were in the 80's. I bought some separate ""smelly sticker"" packs on Amazon to replace the ones in this book, and those ran out of scent within a day or two also. If you have high hopes in this book, or scratch & sniff items in general, you'll most likely be disappointed. Such a bummer!"
3,weak smells,"I bought this book for the smells. I wanted to teach my 15 month old to smell. I didn't like this book for two reasons. One the pages were soft, not hard back board book for little kids hands. The second reason was the smells are on every other page with lots of word in between. My little girl gets bored."
2,Disappointed,"My granddaughter loves scratch and sniff books but most of them are Christmas books. Although this is a cute book about a bunny and the smells are different such as roses, peaches and pickles to name a few, the stickers lost their smell after about a week. Either the company should make better quality stickers or they should include replacement stickers. Very disappointed :("
2,not worth it,"This book has a cute story, but the scratch-and-sniff parts are horrible. There are several scented stickers throughout the book that hardly smell and are obviously stuck onto the pages instead of hidden within the illustrations. There are much better books like this out there for less money."
4,GREATEST SPEECHES,I think it`s a great product. It could be better if it had transcriptions of the speeches.
3,Historical,"My expectations were too high. I thought the speeches would be in their entirety. Some were, some were not. I also wished that all of FDR, for instance, was on one disc instead of broken up onto several. Otherwise, they were a trip down memory lane and in some cases being heard for the first time."
4,The Greatest Speeches of All-Times,"Great Box set of speeches, but was expecting a little bit more speeches that did not focus on political issues."
1,They popped and dont work any more.,So I got them to use for my ipod 30gig video not even a month and they popped . They sound like they are under water now cheap wont be buying any thing from skull candy any time soon.
4,HESH Headphones,"I was skeptical. I read all the reviews and these headphone seemed like all looks and minimal quality. I was wrong. I was impressed with the quality. I listen to a lot of jazz and hip hop, as well as everything else, and I like the balance between bass and treble ( I have used pairs with obnoxiously overwhelming bass) and the sound canceling is pretty good too. Some say they aren't for traveling because of their bulk, but I disagree. These are not meant to be stored away...they are an accessory as much as a headphone, and are exceptionally light (id imagine they'd be great for skating or boarding). Plus, they come with a case.The only downside I found was that because they fit so tight on the head (which is a plus), it makes it so wearing them around your neck is a bit snug too (cant look down too easily). Overall though, I am pleased"
4,pretty good headphones,"Got them for [...] dollars. I say, they are pretty good for traveling, but for audiophiles, it wont do. They do get uncomfortable after an hour or so of wearing, I've had to re-adjust alot of times. The cord is still short for me, even with the extension, but I like the volume knob on the headphones itself. They feel like they are breaking, as the extenders for how long the headphones adjust are wobbly, and just yesterday, I saw someone on the train with the same headphones, but duct-taped where the adjusters are. so those who are clumbsy, be careful, these break easily. Great buy for [...] bucks, but i would never pay full price."
5,Mega bang for the buck!,"I just purchased a Pintech electronic drum set and knew I need a good set of headphones. After reading many reviews and doing some research I went with the SkullCandy (was teetering between this and theAUDIO TECHNICA ATH-M30 Closed Back Dynamic Stereo Monitor Headphones.After receiving them, I plugged them into my drum module and just loved the sound. Full, rich, clear and loud. Very comfortable.My only complaint is that the cord is only 3 feet long or so, so if you're like me and using this for e-drumming or studio work, you'll want to pick up an extension cord as well.Other than that, a great set of headphones.One funny side-note: within the package is a stencil of the SkullCandy logo which they show some pictures on where to use it, and one of them is to spray paint it on your cat. Funny!"
2,Echo-y and uncomfortable,"I'm wearing them right now, trying to listen to them and talk myself into believing that I didn't just get robbed. Midrange is poor. Sounds like I'm listening to a boom box in a pulic restroom. And for all those that say they are huge, well, I must have giant ears because I can hardly cram my hearing appengages into the plastic cups, round like a circle.I work in a cubicle and wear headphones 8-9 hours every single day. The padded headband seems comfortable enough, and by sliding out the adjustable arms on the cups makes them comfortable enough.But given the sound, if what you really want ot hear is good sound, these are not the ones to get. Maybe an EQ could add what's missing, but why would you buy a product that requires compensation just to make acceptable?"
3,Maybe I was expecting too much.,"Cons:Feels like putting your head in a vise.Ear cups are too small.My earbuds have better bass.Pros:Under $30.Cute.Unfortunately, I was too hasty opening the package and now I can't return them. Anyone want to buy a (very gently) used pair of headphones?"
4,"I would've given a five, but...","The sound quality on these headphones are decent; I have no complaints about the sound. If there was a pros and cons section (Which I'm too lazy to write) there'd be only one con. The con would be that the headphones are a bit small. Your ears will be a bit smooshed, so you'll have to take a break from wearing these every once in a while, so your ears won't die. Other than that, I love them. They look great, sound great."
5,wow,These are probably the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever had. they sound great and look cool. the only down side is they leak allot of noice. other than that i would buy these if i were you. (if your friends have a pair try those first to make sure there you.)
1,flimsy,i bought two one for my friend one for me.they both broke at the slider/extender.only had them since mid aug.all we used em for is listening to music at a desk top. the slider is so thin and the audio wire is right next to it.the sounds was good but you know sumtim is wrong if both broke in the same place.hers broke taking them off and mine broke picking them up. now i got a RMA# to send em back. what a effin pain.shoulda got ones with a metal slider.you get what you pay for.
2,Piece Of S#@* !!!!!!,Although I would give the sound of these headphones 5 out of 5 but the overall quality of the materials of it are CHEAP!!!!!!!!!! The plastic that lets you level the headphones broke on both sides within 2 months which is infuriating because i paid $50 for these suckers and they didn't even go through allot of mistreatment. If you wan't good sound go rite ahead and by them but make sure you baby them or they will break pretty soon.
1,They're actually not worth the price. Horrible construction.,"Simply put, these headphones have a tendency to fall apart/crack far too easily - I owned a pair for less than a month, and one of the sliders had somehow cracked open, even though I did my best to take good care of them. A few days later, the sound in the right ear started to decline/go out. Needless to say, I'm not too pleased.The sound quality was decent, but as other reviews have stated, I heard next to no difference between these and the ~$15 Sony Monitor headphones. I ended up paying $50 for the Hesh headphones - I can safely say that I will never again take my business to Skullcandy."
5,Great quality,Product is outstanding in construction quality and audio quality plus blocks out virtually all noise. I use it during workouts at the YMCA and it keeps the ambient noise to a minimum.
4,"Great headphones, crappy cord.","The headphones themselves are great, but the cord is thin and weak. My cord developed a short only a couple of months of use due to bending near the jack. Luckily, the cord is replaceable. So while I recommend buying them, be aware that you might have to pick up a new headphone extension cord if they get any more than light use."
2,Feels cheap and squeezes head,"Headphones look good, but feel cheap, especially the cushion around the ear. I don't have a huge head, yet these were still too tight and uncomfortable to wear for longer than 1/2 hour. Overall, I would not recommend these as there are much better ones out there for the same price."
4,What would Jesus Do?,"Finally, a US citizen who can verbalize with clarity, the lessons Jesus wanted us to learn. How can George Bush & the ""moral majority"" ignore the teachings of Christ & have the blessing of the American people. The word ""Morality"" does not just address sexual preference. Materialism, the use of power, greed, coveting our world neighbors assets, murdering innocent citizens of other countries is what God will call us on when our time comes. This book motivates Christians who believe in the US Constitution and the teachings of Christ to stand up and be heard, then counted!"
3,Misleading image,"I used these same standard trays years ago in my darkroom. They are decent quality and will do the job. There is no problem with quality of the trays or delivery from Adorama.The issue is the color of the trays. I am trying to set up a simple darkroom since my eight year old is getting interested in photography. I thought she would learn photo processing more easily using different color trays. That is the only reason I ordered the set rather than individual trays. The set has three red trays. This is no set! It is just three of the same color. If you want different colors, apparently you need to order each separately."
1,Don't think is worth the money,I bought this book while going through the process of getting nationally certified. It's cumbersome to used and it really is not help at all. Save your money and used it toward the hefty fee you have to pay for your certification.
2,Below average thriller.,"I enjoyed Gallagher's supernatural thriller ""Valley of Lights"" so when I found ""Oktober"" I decided to check it out. The plot, about a man, Jim, who is injected with a mysterious drug, sounded interesting, but the story was not well crafted at all. The first problem is that Jim never seems to be in any real danger. He's just having occasional nightmares. The only real danger is when he starts to try to find out what happened to him. The pharmaceutical company has some big conspiracy against him, but the potential of this plot is never fully realized, and the same is true for most of the subplots. The result is a mix of rather uninteresting, slow paced plot elements, leading up to a rather confusing ending. Not recommended."
4,Great DVD,I have been looking for a DVD that has all the basic moves with beginning to advance levels. This DVD is great very high quality.I am new to the chanting of the mantras that goes on this Dvd so I thought it was a bit odd at first but you can fast forward if you do not like it. But it is a great exercise.Highly recommend...
4,Backgorund music makes it hard to hear the instructor,"Great workouts. No mystical stuff. The transitions from pose to pose feel good. The instructor explains poses well, and the camera captures the moves so you can easily follow along. My only complaint is that the background music is so loud that it is sometimes hard to hear the instructor. I'm sure this won't matter much once I get used to the routines, but the first time, it was hard to follow because I couldn't always hear the soft voice."
4,Good So Far,"To be honest, I haven't gone through the whole dvd because I am always short on time, but I do like it so far. There are different time frames you can choose.You can skip the chants if you like, which I do. The shortest time intervals are pretty easy, perhaps because it's short. Although I've tried yoga before I wasn't consistent in the past, but now I try to do yoga at least 3 times a week. I just started and I think the ones with the shortest time intervals are easy including the B (advance). I haven't tried the longer ones to really give a better review.Update!!!Today I tried the 50 min (B). For me, it is challenging because I don't have the experience. There's a shoulder stand segment which I should ease into it. It's not easy as I thought. I think this a good dvd for beginners who want to transition to intermediate. I hope someday I can do the handstand pose."
4,"Light, fluffy, and oh-so-sweet","Infectious soukous with sweet harmonies, bubbly guitar riffs, and bouncy bass and drums. Light on synths and horns (thank goodness)."
3,good hip hop,"UTG is definitely some goog hip hop. It isn't anything different or extremely special, just some goog hip hop with some gangsta flavor."
2,Weak ALBUM,These rappers from san diego got some good beats on they cd the their rhymes kill it all. not much skill on the mic. the last song evil that men do with raided and c bo is a dope track but it is also on the nefarious speak of da devil cd which is much better........
5,Excellent product,"I knew the product and I wanted it, that's why I ask for it. It is amazing! I needed a dictionary with more words than the one I have got, plus a manual with the basic grammar when I want to refresh my knowledge about something. The CD is amazing because it pronunces every word for you and you can practise with the exercises in it!!!!thank youCollins Cobuild Students Dictionary plus Grammar(Book &CD;)excellent product!!!!"
5,Retrato de una obsesión,"Merecedora del premio Alfaguara de novela 2002, El vuelo de la reina del escritor argentino Tomás Eloy Martínez, es sin duda una de las mejores novelas publicadas en los últimos tiempos. Es la historia de una obsesión, la de G.C. Camargo, poderoso director de un importante diario bonarense; por Reina Remis, joven periodista que se inicia bajo su tutela. Corren tiempos turbios, donde la ilegalidad, la corrupción, los abusos de poder sirven como telón de fondo para esta pasión obsesiva que corroe las entrañas del viejo periodista, que le hace perder todo tipo de sensibilidad que no sea aquella que lo conduzca al completo dominio de la independiente Reina. La familia deja de existir, el trabajo sólo vale como medio para un fin, humillar y someter a una pasión que deja de ser correspondida. Excelente retrato sicológico donde los escrúpulos se pierden, los protagonistas dejan de ser heróes y puede que el mal triunfe al final."
4,Muy bueno,Muy buena novela sobre el orgullo de un editor y su obsesión por una reportera. Cuanta maldad en una sola persona!
5,INTERESANTE LECTURA,Excelente narrativa. Una vez mas los premios Alfaguara caen sobre una joya. Un entrenido relato entre un jefe periodista y una de sus empleadas nos llevara a una historia fascinante con un final impredecible.
2,"This plate is not bonechina, that is why is so cheap!!","Be aware, if you are looking for bonechina stay away from this piece. It is made in China and very low quality"
5,No Motiv doesn't let me down.,"Fantastic buy, you'll enjoy it. The first two tracks come from No Motiv's upcoming album Daylight Breaking and they are fantastic! The vocals are a lot stronger sounding than the previous album, yet Jeremy still keeps that crooning in his voice. Instrumentally, this rocks. The third track sounds kind of like it came from Diagram for Healing, but that's okay because that was a fantastic album. Track 4 ""Keep It Going"" is one of those songs that proves that slow songs can still be fantastic. Awesome backups near the end. Definitely buy! Oh yeah, No Motiv still shines with their fantastic packaging."
2,Adding Unto The Word?,"The military found out long ago that if a code could be broken, it could be used to convey both factual as well as misinformation with the express purpose of leading an enemy astray. Mr. Rambsel makes a fine case for ""coding"" found through Equidistant-Letter Sequence (ELS) in the Bible. His text is positive and if it helps anyone in their walk with the Lord, I will be the first to encourage them. There is however, a very real danger in using this media (coding) to further one's own personal agenda. On page 120, the author cites two very strong warnings given by God written in ""plain text."" The first in the book of Deuteronomy (4:2) and the second in the book of Revelation (22:18-19). It should be read not once but many times over before you then ask yourself, ""Through this new discovery, (ELS), can one be ""adding"" unto the Word?"""
5,EXCELENTE 2,"All the cds i bought are fabulous, Wretch is one of those! I'm happy 'cause the four Kyuss cd's I bought arrived without problems!I LOVE KYUSS!"
3,I'm not sure what to think...,"The obvious conclusion was that Chris Goss really made a big difference for the direction and sound of the band. There are some really, really cheesy tracks on here, but there are some good ones that give a glimpse of what was to come ie:'The Law'. 95% of Kyuss fans bought this one after they heard the other ones, and most would agree that Goss was a huge influence."
3,"Not bad, but future work puts this album to shame.","Although I am a huge fan of Kyuss, I have to say that the noticeable change they made in their sound after this debut album was released was definitely needed. This album is not bad, at all. If I stumbled into a garage (or onto a generator party in the middle of the desert) and heard a band busting out these songs, I'd be pretty fired up, however when Blues for the Red Sun was released, it quickly put this album to shame. Not a bad debut, mainly because it shows a lot of potential, but any of the other, more recent Kyuss albums show what the band really can do."
2,Talent just doesn't shine through,"In person, as a part of a group, with a talented vocalist out front, this artist seems quite gifted. Yet when left to his own ""muse"" and creativity, is quite bland and unextraordinary. I was prompted to purchase a few of his cd's after seeing him perform with Ruth Brown, but was greatly disappointed in his own music. It is at times, reasonably artistic, but mostly banal and pedestrian. Skip the cd's and see him in person,(with others)."
2,Not a very original effort on mr.jones part,"The undiscovered few struck me as being not very original,and at times it is very hard to sort out what he is trying to do,I appreciate the effort but unlike George Benson He falls short of creative Ideas on this Album."
5,The best guitarist EVER,"If you haven't checked out Rodney Jones by now, you need to. This breakthrough recording showcases not only Rodney's trend-setting ideas on the guitar through horn-like phrashing and Articulation, but truly beautiful numbers like ""Tears of a forgotten Child"" and ""Through The Eyes of a Child"". Rodney is a multi-faceted musician who has always proven to be the greatest, but thank God that all of his ideas, spiritually and musically have finally been captured onto an audio recording."
5,Best Jazz Guitar CD in Some Time ...,This really is a nice CD. Rodney's playing has a distinctive sound and the tunes are very interesting. The CD features a number of horns which add to the interest of the music. Easily one of the best of 1999.
4,Excellent!,"This book really explained a lot about the Oregon Trail. But not just that, it really showed some relationships that you didn't think were going to exist. My Grandma gave this book to me a couple years ago, this was the first book I had read by this author. But, I really enjoyed the book. The plot was such that I was a little anxious to find out what was going to happen to the characters. I recommend this book to anyone, it is a great quick read."
2,Cut to pieces,When this movie came out in 1971 I saw it every day at the theater; but most of the movie has been cut out and there's nothing left.
3,a little jerky..... but worth the read.,"the canvas of this book is ambitious and that set the level of my expectations rather high. which this book certainly didn't reach, but having said that it still managed to remain interesting. the narrative seemed to abruptly jump, almost as if the author was afraid to get too elaborate, and it would be easy to do that and get lost i imagine.so the book does show delicacy of touch at various points, but also skips moments that could have been made far richer and memorable. perhaps if she'd cut short on atmosphere and surroundings a little and gone into the characters a little more..."
3,Good mid-level close-up lens set,"This is fairly good, although somewhat expensive set of close-up lenses. The set contains the +1, +2 and +4 diopter lenses, and comes in a nice protective plastic case. The +1 and +2 lenses are fine, and show little (if any) color aberration, even when combined. The +4 lens in my set shows significant off-center color fringing, which, of course, means, that combinations of this lens with the others have the same optical issue. These close-up lenses are not a replacement for a good dedicated macro lens, but they are a decent work-around at a reasonable price."
4,Magical Glass?,"I'm very impressed with my intial results with these filters. No distortion (that I can see), and hardly any chromatic abberation.I think if you have a camera that lacks a macro ""package"" you will be very pleased with this lens kit. I find however that i'd like to purchase them individually more, than as a 3 set... but the price is so good that you can't really complain. I think this is a must have in every photographers bag who likes macro work. 4.5 stars for me."
2,uhhh,"In the past, we have had ok luck with this brand.This time, it was terrible. The pig ears were so small that our dog ate them within a minute.They were 1/4 of the size they were before.Not sure if I will buy this brand again because of it."
