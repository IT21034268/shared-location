2,Just another fish in the bowl...,"May contain some spoilers...(Beware if you have not yet read Da Vinci Code, Improbable)I must admit this book is really catchy. It is a perfect travel book. Easy to read, understand and like an action movie, but this is not a nobel prize book. No characters feel real. You read about 270 pages and you can't empathize with anyone in the book. All big brother scenes, people with special powers, chase; all of them are full of cliches.The lecturing parts, which tries to give scientific information are unrealistic. Dan Brown, Grange, and now this guy. All take ordinary human beings, give them some extraordinary specialty(grand daughter of Jesus, werewolf, or God like psychic) thinking we will be thrilled .It is a waste of time if you want to read a book with substance."
2,"Nice looking, but wasn't accurate","This is a really nice looking outdoor thermometer, but when I hung it up it didn't show the right temperature--it said it was 110 outside--and it was March in northern Illinois. Thinking it might have been where I hung it--on my aluminum siding in the afternoon sun--I took it down and left it a neutral spot seeing if it would give the right temperature. It didn't--this time it said it was around 85 and it was around 45 outside. It's possible that this one just wasn't calibrated right, so it gave the wrong temperature. But not wanting to have the same problem with a new one I just returned it. I wasn't happy to send it back as it looked great where I wanted to put it, but it wouldn't do me any good if it wouldn't give me the right temperature."
2,Pretty But Not Accurate,"The thermometer looks great, but has never had an accurate temperature. Usually off by more than ten degrees! Humidity works okay. Would not buy again."
5,Sandra Hill Gone Wild!,"Sandra Hill is the kind of writer who produces books so funny that you are embarrassed to read them in public because you just know that you'll end up making strange snorting sounds -- or even worse -- having your Diet Pepsi come out of your nose as you choke and gasp with laughter.Love Me Tender is truly Sandra Hill gone very far over the top. It all starts with a pair of shoes... Forget about logic. Forget about reason. This book goes way beyond the wildest reaches of your imagination, and it's hard to classify it.If you're willing to test the boundaries of your tolerance for insanity, give Love Me Tender a try. Just remember, I warned you... This is one loopy book."
2,Not a good example of Sandra Hill,"I own other Sandra Hill novels, including Frankly My Dear and The Last Viking. I thoroughly enjoyed both so I assumed that Love Me Tender would be a keeper as well. Boy was I wrong! The plot is beyond lame, the male lead is oily and weak. Come to think of it, the female lead is pathetic too. The sex scenes are trashy and boring, not steamy and engaging. Sandra Hill is normally great but this is the worst display of her talent."
4,I thorougly enjoyed it!,"This was the first Sandra Hill book I have read. So many people had told me how great an author she was and they were right! This book makes you laugh all the way through (not a good idea when everyone in your house is sleeping<g>). The hero and heroine were hilarious, and I enjoyed watching them fall in love. The Elvis 'thing' was also funny, and I loved the secondary characters. I'll be looking for more of Ms.Hill's books in future!"
2,Exciting but disappointing,"It started out good then it was disappointing.I was expecting major fireworks,there was some not alot.I've read Sandra books and found it to be more exciting and couldn't put it down.Don't get mme wrong I loved Elvis Prestley but he's gone,JMHO.Hopefully the author would learn from this not to write this again in the future.When I saw the title it looked interesting and read it,it turned me off.Sorry for being so critic but at least am being honest about the book.I hope that she'll be writing more adventureous and romantic soon and looking forward to her new books."
5,Attractive and Unobtrusive,I don't usually wear jewellery. Not even a watch. But I decided to buy myself a small Christmas present and this chain caught my eye. It looks great and is light enough not to be noticable. A great selection at a great value.
4,meets expectations,"Gator >Burt and Jerry in the beginning ... meets expectations of my memories of this movie , coupled with semi tough makes it worth the price"
3,Nails Out of the Box,"The brad nails work perfectly in my Paslode Angled Brad Nailer so far. That is what I expected would happen. If they been packaged better for shipping, I would have given them a 5-star rating. Packaged by someone in a hurry with limited recources."
2,Pile of nails,"Bad Packaging,upon opening found a pile of nails inside, some strips broken apart, usable I guess but disappointing. Will not be ordering again"
5,Astonishing...,"This is an excellent book that no programmer should ever go without. Read at least 3 times, and then buy Dale Rogerson and Don Box. EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT introduction to Microsoft's technologies that implement their vision of a document centric system. Microsoft does nothing anymore without using COM/ActiveX/OLE. You must learn this technology if you trully want to become a real hardcore programmer. So what are you waiting for."
4,Play Tower is great fun!,"This is a great toy for a one year old. It has the repetition the little ones love...and when they figure out what happens each time, it's fun to watch them try to catch the balls and penguin before they get to the end! Other than a toddler trying to pull themselves up on the tower, it's sturdy and easy for them to manipulate. Great toy!"
4,Nice toy,"Easy to assemble, my daughter is only 9 months so for now she likes to watch us play with it for her! I have no doubt she will love it when she gets a bit older."
2,"Fun, but not durable","My boys 1 & 3 really liked this toy. They did get frustrated sometimes b/c the balls and penguin don't go down the shoot, just the ramp. The singing frog was a big hit though. It was a pretty quiet and non-annoying toy in general. Unfortunately, it broke a few months after we got it and the company does not offer replacement parts. Debating buying another one."
2,Disappointed,"I just bought this toy for my granddaughter who is turning one and knowing how much packaging goes with this kind of toy I decided to build it before her birthday so she was ready to play. Wow, good thing I did because it was missing a piece of the tower and there's no way for the company to send you a replacement piece.The toy is being returned and not replaced."
2,Not impressed,"I purchased this toy for my 14 month based on the high reviews. When it arrived I found the product to be cheap in construction, the spiral separates easily. The paint on the penquins wore off within a month of gentle play. This toy is particularly stimulating. My daughter found it more entertaining to blow into the vented bottom section of the frog. It sounds like a harmonic when she does this. With the exception of the frog (being used in a way not intended) she has paid little attention over the past 4 months. I will be taking this dust collector to the donation center."
2,flimsy,Ramp breaks apart easily. Cannot put any weight on it or ramp comes apart. kids try to put everything down the tube and only the frog fits in the tube. I am disapointed with this toy.
2,Disappointing...,"Our little one loved this toy, but his favorite part -- the whistling frog down the chute -- no longer works after just 2 months. The plastic controling the frog's ""return,"" at least on our unit, gave out and now he can't enjoy the toy as he did. Perhaps our unit was defective, but I have nothing to compare it with. Ordinary use should not render this feature unusable in such a short time!"
5,Worth every penny,"I don't write many reviews, but this toy deserves one. I've had two children grow up with this toy and it was a favorite of both. It is durable. It is easy for them to use from 9+ mos on, yet captures their attention for many many months. It has multiple play options (my son used the frog as a horn to blow through, my daughter tried all the different balls in the house to see which ones fit down the ramps). This toy will be one of the very few I hang on to for future young guests and my own grandchildren, it's that good."
2,The frog gets stuck,The child's favorite thing to do was to put the frog down the tube but it kept getting stuck. Too bad as the rest of it is really a nice teaching tool.
4,Great Toy,"I bought the 1st play tower for my grandson Henry and he loved it. He played with it almost everyday he was here(2-4 times a week)for well over a year. When his baby sister Matilda developed an interest and they both gave it a workout, the button mechanism began to wear, so I purchased another. Now there is double the fun because we have two sets of balls, penguins, and frogs. Matilda plays with it for a considerable amount of time for a 15 month old (as did Henry at her age). Great toy, I highly recommend it."
5,Lots of fun for my 1-year-old,We got this for my 1-year-old and his 4-year-old sister also likes to play with it. I think it's nice that only the frog fits in the tower. I think it adds to the fun of the game for kids. They also like to play with the frog liks it's a kazoo.
2,comes apart easy,"My 1 year old and my 3 year old like playing with this toy. My 1 year old LOVES the frog. The yellow button is hard for him to push to release the frog so he is unable to fully play with the toy by himself. Both children have discovered that if they pull on the slide it will come apart. It has been very hard to keep it together. I got tired of putting it back together after about a week, so I put the toy up for awhile."
5,LOVE THIS TOY,"I work with children ages birth through age three and in our play group room, this toy is the most used. I have given it out as a gift to one and two-year-olds. Boys and girls love this toy."
2,somewhat disappointed,perhaps i had too many expectations for this toy. my 19 month old grandson was not particularly interested. 2-3 minutes of play and he moved on. it does not seem to offer too many thinking experiences or varied activities. would probably not buy it again.
4,Slim size is good for skinny kids,"These jeans do twist in the wash, which makes for some unusual creases and fade marks, but they're jeans so does it really matter? These are the only jeans (16 slim) that fit my extra-thin son."
5,A Rare Find,"I was so pleased to find long slim jeans like these Wranglers for my 8 year old boy. He is a skinny, long-legged kid and is very hard to fit with jeans. Even most Slims are way too big around! These size 9 Slims are much slimmer than any 8 Slims I've ever seen, and the legs are nice and long. Another reviewer listed the entire size chart which helped me tremendously in choosing the correct size.The jeans are made of good thick denim and have a lean, straight cut. Just what I was looking for! And of course, with Prime shipping they arrived in 2 days."
1,Revised Review (Since Amazon.com staff are so PC),Don't buy it. The quality is very shoddy. Non-American product. Rivets pop off way too quickly. One arm was shorter than the other. CEVEAT EMPTOR!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Nice jacket,"Nice jacket, very bad sizing.I'm 6' 225 pounds, I ordered a Medium and it fits BIG.Be careful when you order."
4,"Good looking, inexpensive","Just got this jacket, looks like a classic M65. I got the XL based on numerous reviews about the sizing; I'm 6'4"" and 270 so XXL is the norm for me. I will say that it's a tad tight in the shoulders, and a little on the short side (unfortunately they don't make a ""tall""), but workable. I look forward to wearing it all fall in sunny Cleveland!"
4,"Great durability, size issues","The jacket is a comfortable fit and feels very durable. I found out from the seller that the jacket is available in a Navy Blue color, which was much preferred to the Olive Green color.However, the size advice to order a size lower was inaccurate. The jacket was cut shorter than I had thought. The X-small was cut too short, while the Small was a ""just right"" fit, no more, no less."
2,Size runs very big,"I am usually an XL - XXL. I read other reviews that stated to get a smaller size, and they were right. I ordered an XL and it fit like a XXL - XXXL. The material was fine, but really not a nice, slim fitting coat."
5,The sizing is different,"I love this coat. It is darker than the picture looks. Just like every other army surplus jacket I've ever seen. Great quality, seems very durable. In reference to the sizing. I read a lot of the reviews before I purchased this coat. There seamed to be high number of people saying the sizes ran larger by a size or two. When it first arrived I tried it on right out of the box and it did feel larger than what I wanted. I made the decision to wash and dry in efforts to shrink and the jacket shrunk quite a bit. It now fits perfect. I would recommend buying your size that you normally wear and shrinking in the dryer on high heat, and then never having to worry about accidentally shrinking a smaller size later."
4,Nice Product - Way Too Large,"Very well made jacket... great price and it includes the liner, which others offered in this medium don't include. The zipper is heavy duty, and the material is very tough. Make sure you get at least 1 size smaller than usual. I'm a XL so I ordered a Large and it was still too large. I had to get this jacket in a medium to get the right fit. No regrets, excellent jacket for winter and if you remove the liner you can use it any time of year. The sizing issue made me give it only 4 stars."
3,not their best,"I don't really like this particular product, it is a little too flimsy. The price was right, but it is a little awkward."
4,Great Bag for the price!,"I recently bought this bag. Its a little smaller than i was thinking it would be, but it defenitly does what i needed it to do. It holds all the tools i needed it for, and holds up to the weight of all my wrenches, screw drivers and my drill gun. The fany pack it comes with attaches great to the main bag and i never take it off, just use it for more storage. If your looking for a bag to hold all of your general tools, than this is the bag for you. Great bag made of great material with alright storage. A+ product, recomend it to anyone who has to move with there tools."
3,For the fans,"This DVD captures a concert given by Neil and the Trans Band in Berlin in 1982. If you are a Neil Young fan you will undoubtably enjoy the 60 minute concert with good versions of Cinnamon Girl, Like A Hurricane and songs from the Trans album.The main disappointment of this set however is the complete abscense of extras (a disappointing 5.1 stereo mix is not an extra !),the uninspiring packaging and the short running time.The main positive point is the inclusion of the unreleased track Berlin, which it has to be said is a damn good song.As I noted earlier fans will enjoy this. If you are looking for a definative Neil DVD I'd recommend the RoadRocks show."
4,neil in outer space,"A must-have concert for Neil Young fans, this video features rare live footage of the rock legend filmed in West Berlin, Germany. The 1983 show was the last stop of Young's European tour and included several of his earlier hits, such as ""Cinnamon Girl"" and ""Old Man,"" along with songs from his 1982 Trans album, which featured synthesized vocals and sci-fi musings. Young is accompanied by the Trans band, including sidemen Ralph Molina of Crazy Horse, Ben Keith, Joe Lala, Bruce Palmer (formerly of Buffalo Springfield), and Nils Lofgren. This DVD version features 5.1 audio. Review from Rhino Records"
1,huh???,"I must have gotten hold of a different DVD than the rest of the reviewers. But it sure looks to have the same cover and everything.I had read the reviews and was really looking forward to this DVD. What an utter disappointment!! I would think Neil would be too embarrassed by this DVD to let it be available. The sound is just totally TRASH!!! I could only force myself to watch about ten minutes of the performance. It's hard to figure how none of the reviewer's of this DVD had anything really bad to say about the sound on it. The lack of sound makes this a total ""THUMBS DOWN"" DVD."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!,This is exactly what I was looking for. I saw this DVD over six years ago and always wanted it. THANK YOU!
2,Whatever!,"This is a fairly boring book with not much of a plot or theme or anything.It was actually written by 2 writers but that is hard to believe.But read it if you'd like as it's OK,I guess,and it is only 73 pages long.Would you like to know what it is about??Well,really it is just about a little girl whose triplet brothers want her to be just like a boy and don't let her wear shorts that have flowers on them.At the same time,she is to be a bridesmaid for her old-ish Aunty.She has an alright time at the wedding and then decides that she wants to wear her floral shorts.And they all live happily ever after.Meh!!!"
2,Not a people scent,"I don't like this fragrance. The same scent is often found in the lobbies of apartment leasing offices and model homes in the South OC area. Whatever images or feelings that conjures up for you may be positive, but not so for me."
3,"Smells edible, almost","Angel Men is a very very strong ""gourmand"" fragrance. It's without a doubt the longest lasting cologne I've ever worn. I sprayed some on my wrist (too much looking back on it) and the smell lingered, even after showering nightly for 3 days I could still smell it on my wrist.It's very easy to od on this cologne, so I recommend spraying some in the air and then walking through the mist. Even then it might be best to wait for a couple for it to settle some. Believe me, too much can be sickening...as bad as BO!I don't recommend wearing it to work unless you wear very little. It's the kind of fragrance that should be worn out on the town or in a club setting."
1,An Unfortunate Disappointment,"This scent has received much critical acclaim and is known for being unique.Unfortunately I got seduced by all the positive reviews and bought this scent without either smelling it or wearing it personally. My excuse is that there are no decent frag. vendors within an hours drive from me so I decided to purchase Angel Men through Amazon.I received the item quickly and it is a nice looking bottle. However, I find the scent repulsive and too deep. To me it smells like the inside of a smoker's car, perhaps even a bit skunky! I've tried it twice, and each time I end up wiping it off with a steaming hot facecloth!Different colognes react differently to people's chemistry though. Perhaps you would like A*Men as so many others do-more power to them-but dont repeat my mistake and make sure to try it yourself before you buy it."
5,This is my son in laws favorite,My son in law is very pleased with Angel. Fragrance is very nice and refreshing. It was a Christmas gift.
1,Unless they are for Halloween...,I bought these for my eight year old son. They were so uncomfortable and so stiff. They did not look good either: Do not think you are getting a pair of Ray Ban. I do not understand the other reviews at all. I returned them.
3,Won't be using but they are good quality,"Good quality shades but... they are huge! Bigger than I could see looking decent on most people, and the part that goes behind your ears is very uncomfortable."
1,You get what you pay for,"Before this broke the temple pieces would constantly bend. After several months, as you can guess, one broke temple broke off."
1,Worst Quality Ever!!,"This product that i've ordered is a horrible quality, the product came with soo many problems that you wouldn't believe it's just a freaking pair of sunglasses."
4,Nice!!,The sunglasses are very nice for the price. I gave them to my son since he had been looking for these type of sunglasses. He really likes them!
2,Cheap $10 sunglasses that are really with $1.,"Let's face it, none of us buying this product expected anything great. I expected cheap sunglasses that would last me a few months. I've had Aviators from target or walmart before, that cost about $5 more than this.These glasses are more of something you'd put in a film to showcase than to use for every day eye protection. The yellow band at the top puts the glasses much further away from your eyes than most glasses. The wrap-around-your-ear frame is a terrible design. It feels cheap and flimsy, and that's because it is.While I never expected much with these glasses, I expected more than something you could find at a dollar store. My advice to you is to pass on this specific model (The ones pictured) and buy a different pair."
1,Painful !!!,"Tried them on & they were VERY PAINFUL to the earlobe...DO NOT purchase this item!!! I have a similar pair that I have have used for 30 years & the wrap=around the ear lobe is much more pliable. These are rigid & are of an inferior material. Sorry I purchase this item! In Lakewood, Colorado"
5,Nice shades,The sunglasses are exactly as described by amazon. There built well and for the price can't be beat! The lens are a little big for me but that has nothing to do with how nice they are
3,very attractive and fine,"excellent seller, great service, and the product is the same as described on page. I would definitely return to buy from this seller, the reason to buy this lenses is that i liked, there is only one problem, they are very large and came a bent flange, at first it was uncomfortable and aching ears, that's why I gave three stars, hope my review was helpful"
5,Green Bay Packers rug,"My order was received timely and in good condition, it was just what I was looking for. A quality product and no hassles. Thanks"
4,"Great, but...","We got this from Costco at well under half the price listed here, and it's lasted well over a year. But for some reason, Tonka's latest trucks are designed to make it VERY hard to fit the action figure into the driver's seat. We have this problem on the ambulance, the helicopter... and especially on the garbage truck. The door just doesn't open wide enough to allow an easy fit, and as an adult it takes me a lot of work to get the driver to sit down in the seat. My 3 year old son? Forget it, no way he can fit the driver in there.If only the door stopper wasn't there and the door opened a bit wider, it'd be SO much easier to use with the action figure."
3,Broke within 1 minute,"My son LOVES this truck. However, we had it 1 minute and the little trash can broke off the up/down belt. So that was useless.However, the fact that he can shove things in the top and open the back to get them is a huge bonus. I would recommend the toy, but don't count on the up and down lever working very long."
4,Price review only,"Haven't opened the toy yet to check for durability for my 3 1/2 year old, but just looking at the toy and pressing some of the buttons while it's inside the package, it looks like it will be great fun. I happen to have a boy who just loves watching the garbage trucks come around and empty all the trash cans into the truck.[...]. I hope I don't have any of the electrical problems that some have complained about."
5,Our 2 boys love this garbage truck!,"Our boys are 2.5 and 4 years old and absolutely love these Tonka garbage trucks. This is our third garbage truck purchase within the last year and these have been the best. Our kids really love being able to load the dumpster up with ""trash"" and using the levers, they love to watch the truck dump the contents into the back of the truck. We bought these garbage trucks two months ago and they are still going strong. Just make sure to turn off the headlights when the kids go to sleep so the batteries don't run out. We have two other versions of the Tonka garbage truck and this one is the sturdiest so far."
4,3-4 Year old love it!,"My son loves his recycling truck. It is fun because you can fill it with garbage...or whatever else. Stuff goes in the top and out the back...or visa versa. The back door is a little tricky on ours but it is a good toy for the money. Gave one as a gift to his friend too because when he came over, the friend cried because he wanted to take it home."
3,Meh,"My son received this garbage truck for his 2nd birthday. It is hard for me to speak badly of it since he still plays with it every day 6 months later. Unfortunately, he now pretends to load the trash into the truck because after less than a month of playing with it the mechanism for moving the trash can up and down broke. The doors are flimsy and falling off and the noises the truck makes are loud and obnoxious. The buttons allow the truck to leave the ridiculously loud horn going forever unless it is specifically turned off. It would be a much better toy for parents to deal with if the batters were taken out. You've been warned."
5,the unforgettable buddy clark,This is a very good reissue of Cr. Clark's most famous songs. A welcome addition to an library of popular music of the 1940's.
4,Very good,"I purchased this item for my dad and we all tried it out. It worked really well and you could really feel the rollers. I was disappointed in the fact that I assumed ""portable"" meant that it would operate on a battery and could be used in the car or on airplanes because he travels a lot. That was not the case. Other than that, the actual product is very good."
3,Modest helping,"As mentioned in the review above, there are less than 80 minutes, and they are spread over two disks!The use of 2 disks allows a separation of 'classical' from 'pop, jazz, folk', though the first track on disk one seems more like 'pop' than classical.There is a generous booklet, 30 pages, with good English and French notes.I was delighted to get a long version of Swinging Shepherd Blues, which the notes say was from 1957. (I see it hit Billboard charts in early 1958, perhaps as an edited, shorter release?)Much good music (several really vintage tunes) that I was not familiar with, but at the price, I wish the disks were longer."
3,Quickly fell apart.,"I was initially happy with this purchase until one of the pages fell off within a few uses. My son likes to remove the large truck puzzles and the textures through out the book make it a great tangible experience. Considering the fact that this is intended for the very, very young, I expected a more durable product."
5,Gackt's Cresent CD,"This has got to be one of his best CD releases since MARS. I was surprised Amazon.com finally has this in stock! After his last two albums (Rebirth and MOON) this has shown us that Gackt still has a lot to give to his fans. All the songs are very catchy and original. With his rock, gothic yet with a mix of classical style this is a MUST have for all Gackt fans around!1. Dybbuk - 8/102. Mind Forest - 10/103. Tsuki no Uta - 7/104. Kimi Ga Matteiru Kara - 10/105. Solitary - 6/106. Hoshi no Suna - 10/107. Lust For Blood - 10/108. White Eyes - 10/109. Kimi Ga Oikaketa Yume - 9/1010. Last Song - 10/1011. Birdcage - 9/1012. Orenji no Taiyou - 10/10Overall Score: 9.5/10"
1,Beware bootleg CD through Amazon partners,Unfortunately I'm finding out way too late that the Crescent CD I ordered is a bootleg. I had no idea that I had to worry about this when ordering through Amazon.
4,A Very Traditional Christmas Collection,"These are the versions of Christmas Classics the characters in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""A Christmas Story"" must have heard as they walked through those classic Christmas films. It covers nearly all the most-loved holiday songs in rarely-heard versions (Doris Day's ""Here Comes Santa Claus,"" Rosemary Clooney's ""Winter Wonderland,"" ""The Christmas Song"" by its author, Mel Torme) features fine carol renditions by traditional Christmas crooners Tony Bennett, Andy Williams and Johnny Mathis, and gets to original holiday hits by Gene Autry and Jimmy Boyd. The only down note is the cynical ""We Need A Little Christmas,"" sung by Angela Lansbury in her title role as Mame. A fine, old-fashioned musical holiday decoration."
3,it's okay,"Probably not quite worth the money but okay for adding to the holiday collection any way, LOL. Hey its Christmas after a while they all seem like you just heard that song."
1,$44.95 for 9 oz?,"They must be joking. They look yummy but not at this price!! $45 for one bag, come on, get it right so I can try them and revise this review."
2,Caution! Wobbles Ahead!,"I did a stupid thing and relied SOLELY on a CD review in Opera News (written by one of my favorite singers, Drew Minter) before buying this opera. It is a disappointment (understatement). The singers are mediocre (with two exceptions) and the orchestra is uninspired --no doubt fatigued by the unnecessary length of this VERY ORDINARY opera. Other sounds intrude: the never-ending applause and RUMBLINGS (one hears the sounds of the singers plodding the stage -- on my sound system it reminds me of a storm brewing in the distance or the commencement of an earthquake!) One female singer on this CD (she shall remain nameless) wobbles, hollers, and shrieks thru her high notes; she seems ""lost"" and unsure of her voice. I reread Minter's review and can only believe he wrote such a kind review in order to boost baroque awareness? support the ""troops"" who explore Vivaldi's works? If you still are tempted to buy this CD...PLEASE find a place you can listen to this FIRST!"
1,PLEASE do not waste your money,Have not had this brand before but did have the same type of opener. This opener lasted for 3 bottles and quit working. This is a piece of junk and I would not recommend this to anybody. Go in a different direction!
2,Be careful,The first one I purchased broke; it is pretty shabby material. They give you an extra corkscrew but be careful. I would not try to replace it since there are no instructions and there are some very small springs. It does not work well on artificial corks. Amazon was great and replace my first one I am only using it on real corks and so far so good.
2,WINE BOTTLE OPENER,THE WINE OPENER I PURCHASED WILL NOT OPEN 1.5 LTRE WINE BOTTLES. YOU DREPRESS THE COCK SCREW AND IT COME RIGHT OUT OF THE COCK AND DOES NOT REMOVE THE COCK FROM THE BOTTLE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE IT WORK CORRECTLY
4,Fastest & Easiest way to open a bottle,"One star down because is a bit bulky.Even as I write this I'm debating that star because short of SHOOTING the cork and the top of the bottle off, this is the quickest and easiest way to get the cork out of a bottle. Opening a bottle with this is far better than that; no messing around with glass shards all around, holes in the walls behind, or innocent bystanders being hit by any shrapnel."
2,MIU Connoisseur Corkscrew - help needed,"I bought this in November, and enjoyed it so much I ordered several more as Christmas stocking stuffers. Suddenly it's stopped working; the corkscrew goes down properly, then when I pull the lever up, it comes back up, sans cork. I tried using the spare corkscrew, but it made no difference. The only thing I noticed is that a little piece of black plastic fell off the bottom. Don't know why that should matter, but then . . . If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know."
5,Simply amazing,This wine bottle opener is fantastic. No more struggling to get a cork out. Works instantly.I am so happy I decided to purchase this. Highly recommended.
1,Dont Buy,The description suggests it is made in France when in fact it is made in China. I bought two as gifts and the foil cutter's broke in half on both within the first few usages (embarrassing). Spend a little more money for the real thing.
2,Works well until it breaks - Ours broke after 20 uses,"This thing worked great until it broke after 20 uses. While the unit is heavy and appears durable, the mechanism that locks the corkscrew is weak and breaks very easily."
1,My five successful openings,At the second try the metal in the cap cutter fell out. Three try's later the corkscrew would not hold on to the cork and slid out. The crappy one I had from Walmart was even far superior to this one. What a rip-off. Makes you afraid to order anything mechanical. Wonderful how these things fall apart just when it's too late to send them back and all the packaging is gone! PS I only put one star here because that was my lowest option
1,poor craftmanship,"This item didn't last even 3 months , do not buy it will be a waste of money buy another Corkscrew that will last !!"
1,Poor product,"I have had 3 of these, the original broke within 30 days and was replaced by Amazon.com. The replacement broke within 60 days and because the original came with a lifetime (evidently a very short lifetime) warranty Amazon.com replaced it as well. The third one has already shown signs of breaking as well. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
2,Stopped working after 2 months!,"It worked fine for a couple of months, then parts were falling out and stopped working. I had a similar opener before by a different manufacturer it worked well for years. don't buy this!"
2,Questionable Durablility!,The first few times I had used this opener it worked like a charm. After a few bottles had been opened the first thing to go was the foil cutter. It fell apart. Then the opener itself started falling apart a couple of weeks ago (only a few months operation). I really like the idea of this item. It made it very easy to open the bottles!! I just wish it had a more durable construction.
1,problems with this product,"While this product looked fine, on the second bottle opened with it, the spring loaded washers on the side came apart. Fortunately, I was able to find the press-on washer and spring that had flown across the room. I took the opener to my workbench and with a hammer and punch was able to get it back together. It has worked fine for the last couple of openings, but I am unsure how long my ""fix"" will last."
1,"Nice looking, not worth a dime","I do most of my shopping at Amazon, and this is by far the work quality item I've ever received, it came in a very poorly designed box, the items were loose, and after the first use one of the connectros popped and came out, there was no way to put it back, I had to return the item as it was useless, I'm really surprised that Amazon carries this."
2,Worked Well For A While,"I owned the thing for about 2 years, during which it worked as advertised. Was actually very pleased with it until, all of a sudden, it stopped lifting the cork out of the bottle. Instead of lifting the cork out, the plunger just unscrewed, leaving the cork in the bottle. Examination revealed that a small plastic part had broken, rendering the product useless. A part, I might mention, that was not replaceable. What good is solid metal construction, if a small plastic part is on the critical path? So much for lifetime warranty."
2,Not so happy as other reviewers,"Just received the corkscrew and I am disappointed in the quality of the casting of the gears and the overall finish and feel. The gears on the handle are unevenly ground and pockmarked. The fit of the parts is loose and sloppy. Either this one should not have gotten past quality control or I should have purchased a more expense brand. I am not going to return it because of the price of shipping and, no doubt, it will pull corks for a while.Very fast delivery from Amazon."
1,poor quality item -- you get what you pay for!,"This corkscrew is cheaper than all the other ""rabbit-style"" corkscrews, and there's a perfectly good reason for that -- the quality of the item is much lower than all the rest. It looks pretty coming out of the box, but the construction is relatively flimsy (plastic in several key high-impact areas like the lever-hinge mount and the corkscrew-turner) and the design tolerances are really loose (the gears don't mesh very smoothly). Also, the supplied plastic is completely useless because the corkscrew won't fit in it, much less actually stand upright in it.If you want the cheapest possible rabbit-action corkscrew, this is the item for you. Just don't expect it to compare to more expensive products."
3,wine opener,The price was right and it works but the mechanism as should have been expected is not as smooth as the same but more expensive model. Frankly do not expect it to hold up but can buy 5-6 of these for price of the better model - so you take your chances
3,"Love the rabbit design, but the quality could be better","I'm surprised more people haven't had problems with this wine opener. This is our 2nd 'rabbit' style opener, and after a few months the cap holding the screw on is starting to strip. When it's gone the opener will be useless. We'll pay a little more next time in hopes we get a bit better quality."
2,Not impressed,"The screw does not enter the cork squarely, and winds up on one side or the other. My wife complains that it is too heavy, and even the Teflon-coated screw is difficult to insert when opening non-cork closures. Save your money and buy a Screwpull Classic - they work FOREVER!"
2,"Work well, but doesn't last","The corkscrew operation starts off working very well, about 2-3 months in it begins to be a little more of a problem. Now at 5 months it fails completely, on the downstroke the corkscrew threads in fine, but on the pull stroke it now just unwinds out of the cork, it should just pull the cork! Also several of the rods of the assembly have come completely loose making it work in a sloppy fashion.This is frustrating now with Amazon only allowing about a 45 day window for the return policy. Yes, Amazon will allow you to return for partial credit and pay the return shipping. For a $20 item it just doesn't add up!"
2,Works apx 4 -5 months,I bought 4 of them and they work great UNTIL it breaks as always. I real is too bad because it does work great for a short period of time. So if you can find a site who leases them for 4 months you are the winner . If you buy one have an extra because when it breaks you get no warning.
1,MIU Corkscrew didn't pull a single cork,"This corkscrew didn't pull a single cork.However the MIU Corkscrew pushed corks into the two bottles that I tried. Therefore I am calling it a ""cork pusher"".Will return this to Amazon, one of my favorite sellers, and who has a sterling return policy.I am recommending to Amazon that you discontinue this item from your offerings and return all stock to the manufacturer for a full credit. This plan will save future grief for Amazon."
1,broken after 3 weeks,As earlier reviewer reported a pin connection on this corkscrew came undone within 3 weeks. I too was able to reinsert with great difficulty but the fix only lasted for about 4 more bottle openings. And the box and inserts make no mention of any warranty. Would not buy this brand again.
1,junk junk junk,"these openers are no good, they break after only using them about a dozen times or sobuy the better one because these are a waste of time and money"
1,Time to move on,"As many older reviews here state, we had this wine opener for several years and loved it. This year, a component broke and I remembered vaguely that it had an advertised lifetime warranty. Because I purchased it on Amazon, I could look up the product info. I contacted the company and they did send us a replacement (we paid shipping).The new opener was noticeably made of cheaper materials. The foil cutter began falling apart almost immediately, and this weekend a part fell out the opener, rendering it inoperable. It lasted eight months.We'll look for a similar style to replace this one, but one made more durably."
1,"don,t waste your money",This is a bad product. I had opened 6 bottles of wine and it broke and was replaced by the supplier and the second one was not any better . It is very poor quality and I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,Not as depicted,"I ordered this wine opener as a Christmas gift for my parents. I have a similar one, and enjoy how easy it is to use. The MIU opener, though, was flimsy and poorly made. The components were loose and wobbly, and it did not work properly. It also did not appear precisely as shown in the picture, as the metal handles were pointed at the end rather than round. Obviously, that should not affect the function or quality, but it makes me wonder whether the seller is shipping a different product. I'm returning the wine opener and will order a different brand."
2,Poor Quality,Didn't last long before it started to fall apart. Wouldn't recommend it if it will be used on a dailybasis.
1,junk!!!!,worked 3 times then set screw in corkscrew wobbled and has become impossible to use. Absolute junk. Save your money and get a rabbit or stick with the old standby corkscrew.
1,Do not buy this Corkscrew,"This Corkscrew worked for a couple of months only ---period.Do not buy --unless you want to waste some money ...What I find interesting is that it comes with a lifetime warranty. If you Google the manufacturer, you get the distributor, whose website states you need to contact the manufacturer. Upon calling the distributor anyway(206-605-0555)..the phone line is disconnected.... Good luck to those who buy this junk !!!!"
2,worked for 16 months,"It worked for 16 months and then a spring popped out of the side and rendered it useless. Also, the handle has edges on it that are uncomfortable to use when operating the extraction process."
1,Broke After Twenty Uses,"Heavy, awkward to handle and broke after twenty uses. In my humble opinion I would suggest someone looking for an easy way to open a wine bottle to look elsewhere and don't buy this brand in any shape or form. Cheap foreign crap!"
1,A real piece of junk,My MIU corkscrew broke exacty one day after Amazon's return policy prevented (30 days)a full refund. Little parts and springs flew all over the kitchen making it impossible to put it back together. For just $21 I threw it in the trash. I cannot recommed this poorly made item to anybody.
1,waste of money,"only worked twice, then stopped. not worth it. i would not recommend this product there are other more expensive which will work better"
1,I regret this purchase. :(,"I'm very disappointed in this purchase! My parents have a corkscrew that has the same design but obviously by a better manufacturer. Tonight I decided to try to open a bottle of wine with it for the first time and it was AWFUL!! I am going to go back to the old cheap corkscrew I use on camping trips. I had to seriously struggle to get the screw into AND out of the cork. I'm 27 and very active but it was a workout trying to use this thing. I shouldn't have had to struggle nearly as much as I did. I tried another cork right after, and it was just as hard. Granted it was used... however the seller said it was like new. From what I can tell it is just seriously cheap design."
2,Cheap Thrill,"The product worked fine for about 3 months but eventually became less reliable then finally the opener came off the track. There is no way to reset it that I know of, no instructions for how to repair yourself or repair options. Spend a few more bucks and get something more durable!"
2,Fooled by the French,"I chose this wine opener based on the fact that it is sold by a French (who know their wine) company and the fact that it is similar to a very popular design, i.e. the Rabbit. I was also hoping that the metal used to make it would be more robust than the plastic used in similar devices. Stated simply, this opener does not work; that is, unless you consider pushing a cork INTO the bottle to be the same as opening a bottle. In the short time I had it, the ""opener"" was 0 for 2 in opening bottles with artificial or composite corks and 2 for 4 in opening bottles with natural corks. The cork that broke the camel's back was a decent Bordeaux I am currently enjoying that features a lovely nautral cork floating inside the bottle. On the positive side, it looks good, it feels good in the hand (like it should work), and the foil cutter does work well. Too bad it doesn't pull corks out of bottles."
4,Mixed emotions.,"I give it four stars because, yes, it is an easy two step process, but I could also see giving it three because I find it difficult to get the cork off the screw and have pinched myself a few times."
3,Sort of good,"The first MIU corscrew I had lasted years. When there was a crack in the plastic housing I replaced it. It worked fine initially and then last Thanksgiving, it started pushing corks right into the bottle, splashing wine all over me and a guest. I took a good look at the MIU and it seemed like the screw itself was loose. It wasn't easy to tighten but I did manage it, and it's been working fine ever since. I like the long lever and the ease of removing a cork. If the level becomes difficult to maneuver after a while, try a bit of WD40."
4,Not bad for the price,"The first one lasted us 2 1/2 years, not too bad for $30, and we use it a lot! Our first one died, the plastic just broke so there was no fixing it, but it worked great up until then, so at the sale price I'm getting another one. It is very easy to use, and I really like the cutter that comes with it."
2,great at first,"this worked great for a few months. Then the shaft that holds the steel guide (not the corkscrew) came out of the sleeve. It is just a friction fit. I worked it back in, and it came out again. try another one..."
2,Worked well until it broke,"I threw this item out over a year ago, after it broke. The part that broke was a linear gear made of a very cheap cast metal.Now I am looking for something better...."
2,Didn't Last,"Worked fine for two months, but broke well before its ""good for 20,000 pulls"" claim. The Rabbit corkscrew that I paid $70 for lasted for three years. If I had to buy one of these every couple months, I'd be paying a lot more over even just a one-year period."
4,It's A Bargain,I've never seen an opener like this one for such a good price. I was expecting something flimsy but it works great. It even comes with a spare corkscrew and a nice stand to keep it on the counter. My only negative is the cheap foil cutter which broke in two.
3,Works well but is poorly made,This works very well -- when it isn't falling apart. Requires attention to keep the handles in place but otherwise opens wine bottles with little effort.
2,I loved it until it quit working three months later.,"I loved it until it quit working three months later. I used one at a friends house and decided I needed one of my own. My guy had to do a little trouble-shooting on some loose pegs, but we kept it and used it almost daily. Now we're trouble shooting it again. The screw penetrates the cork but leaves the cork in the bottle."
1,Do Not Purchase!,The wine opener pushed the first two corks right into the bottle of wine. The third bottle did not push the cork into the bottle... but would not pull the cork out of the bottle. Amazon would not refund our purchase price for this defective product. $28 lost.
4,Easy to use,"This is so easy to use. It looks great as well. The extra corkscrew is nice, I doubt I'll ever need it though."
4,Good product.,Use it every other evening. Only downside is the accompanying foil cutter was a bit weak - I broke it when trying to spread apart to remove the foil that I wanted to keep intact to glue in the bottle when it was empty for display.
1,Very poor quality,"This item is poorly constructed and broke after only a few months of use. The screw simply spins in and out of the cork, and will no longer extract it. The pins that hold the clamping handle in place are loose and fall out easily. Buy a different unit!"
4,Good cork puller,"We had a previous rabbit cork puller and it worked slightly better than this one. On the other hand it broke after only a few years of light use. So this is a pretty replacement. Our only finding is that it is rather hard to make the final movement to remove the cork from the puller, but otherwise it works just fine."
2,Not worth it,Good thing it was this cheap because in less then a year it stopped working. I'm back to using the old fashion twist kind. This is the second one of this type I've had and I won't purchase any more of them.
1,No good.,We reverted to the generic manual twist opener after struggling w/ this. Should have gotten the Rabbit. Would have been worth the extra $.
1,broken.,I was given this corkscrew for Christmas. I loved it!!!!! ..until it broke after less than 3 months. And there is no information about a warranty or replacement. ...Bummed. I think there are better bangs for your buck out there.
1,Broke after 1 month of use.,"Plastic piece at the bottom broke off after ~1 month of use. Of course, this was 1 week after Amazon return policy expired. Would definitely not purchase this brand again."
5,Amost Magic! Highly Recommended,"I was given the ""MIU Connoisseur Corkscrew"" as a Christmas gift two years ago. Since then, we have used it several times a month (I drink a glass of red wine every day, medicinally of course :-) with the same great results every time.The device is well made and easy to use, if/when it happens to break I will replace it with another.Highly recommended!CFH"
2,I'll read the reviews more carefully in the future,"Like others I bought this item only to have it fail after 2 months. For the first month, it worked well hence the two star review. Since there is no path to repair (deliberately I suspect), I'll buy a different brand from some other source."
2,Worked for one bottle of wine,"I purchased this opener after my previous one (same style, more expensive manufacturer) broke after two years of faithful service. After using this opener one time, it was rendered useless. The threading for the hinge was stripped. This is the same problem that killed my other opener, but it took two years to get to that point.It's worth the money to spend a few extra dollars to get a reputable corkscrew."
1,"Awful, do NOT buy","I bought this as a gift, thinking it was perfect. A cheap and effective bottle opener. It opened 3 maybe 4 bottles and broke. Whatever you do, do NOT buy this product. It is a piece of garbage."
4,Early English,"I actually enjoyed this album. A little more focus than the first of Michael's efforts. if you're a real follower of Michael English's work, you can really tell how he was developing as an artist."
3,a nice item,"I thought these were a great idea. I found them in a used bookstore for $5.The good: The goddess cards cover a pretty wide range of pantheons. The descriptive text on the back is well-written and high quality. The artwork is imaginative.The less-than-good: Overall, it seems the artist has one female face that she uses as a template for her art: full lips, long face, peaceful yet somewhat vacant eyes. In a deck like this, I would have desired perhaps some more differences among the goddesses in order to highlight the natures of the deities depicted, especially the more feral or darker aspects, which this deck seems to shy away from. It has a very warm/fuzzy/positive feel, and seems to avoid or gloss over some of the darker archetypes.After browsing through the deck again, it almost seems like she might have used the same model for many of the pieces. Despite that complaint, this is still a solid product for which i would have paid full price."
3,Goddess Knowledge Cards -Susan Seddon Boulet,"I was drawn to the cards mainly for the art. Must read about her history to appreciate her connections to GOD. Her Art work Magnificent-The Knowledge insights are great.About the product, it is too bad companies are greedy. Susans work deserved to be delivered to the world on good Gold Leaf, high quality card stock.These cheap Chinese thin card stock reproductions stick together and take bending sets easily whick make them useless for working card sets. If you are a working reader, buy many of them.If you appreciate them Purchase them for gifts.Silvershaman"
1,damaged and missing cards,there a great pack of cards but im rating them one star becasue over half of the cards where badly damaged and to top that off 3 cards where missing im not pleased at all
2,Goddesses knowledge cards,"The cards were a bit of a disappointment- first of all, they are very small in size, second there is no indication on how to use them with the pack. I have used another S. Boulet pack before and wanted to purchase that one, but this just isn't it. The paintings are beautiful, it can be used but it is not so inspiring.Goddesses Knowledge Cards: Paintings by Susan Seddon Boulet"
4,THE BEST BUY GREATEST HITS CD,"This was almost a toss up, with the ""Collectibles"" CD being very good with 27 songs as well. The reason I choose this was it also includes some solo work, ""Keeping the Customer Satisfied"" and ""Let's Give Adam and Eve Another Chance"", as well as his top tens hits. They are all here, including ""Woman, Woman"" ,""Young Girl"", ""This Girl Is A Women Now"", ""Lady Willpower"", ""Over You"" and ""Don't Give Into Him""B SIDES Such as ""Don't Make Promises"" and ""Daylight Stranger"" are included, with choice album filler.I Just saw Gary Puckett in Ft. Lauderdale at a concert and his voice is still fantastic! Check out his shows, you will enjoy it!A good low cost CD with great time less cuts. Why not?"
5,An excellent retrospective of Gary's career,"This collection contains his all 7 of his top 40 hits, many great album tracks and rarities. Some of the songs have been remixed from the multi-track tapes but the remixes sound just as great as the original mixes and others have been remastered from the original master tapes by Bob Irwin and Vic Anesini. Columbia/Legacy has done a great job with the collection and they favored it to be comprehensive, to have unreleased material and beautifully remastered stereo sound over the four songs from the original Greatest Hits LP from 1970, which has been on CD in the past but is now out of print, that aren't hits. This CD is great for all fans of Gary Puckett & The Union Gap for an affordable price."
3,Filled a gap in my pop music history knowledge.,"Yup, I recognized the voice that I could never place a name with, and that I remember from listening to on the radio as a child. This isn't exactly a CD that I'd take to a desert island or listen to often, but I'll admit it's way better than I thought it would be. I figured I'd get a blast-from-the-past from the few big hits and then have to listen to a lot of filler garbage, but this CD is actually very listenable all the way through.Gary Puckett certainly had a great vocal talent, and it was great to catch up on that part of my music listening past that I couldn't quite place."
4,Science on vacation,"This book exemplifies ""science on vacation"" -- not the idea that we are taking a break from the scientific method, but rather the notion that scientists can be playful if they want to be. ""I believe that there is an external reality"" and that other people are not figments of my imagination, says one contributor. Another says that all human consciousness is ""a conjuring trick."" Some of the world's top scientists, philosophers, and other thinkers are letting their minds roam and thinking the big thoughts, and the result is (mostly) fascinating.It was surprising for me, as a non-scientist, to note how many ""big"" problems in science are not yet resolved and how many important propositions thus remain unproved."
3,Just ok.,I bought this to read on the plane ride to Mexico. I found myself fliiping through the boook looking for the gems and there are a few but overall I would not buy again.
2,I expected More...,"I was expecting some real insight into the nature and meaning of 'believe' and 'prove' but it seemed to me that none of the luminaries answering the question had given it much thought. Today's ""leading thinkers on Science"" mostly provided rather short articles and most said they believed that there was life elsewhere in the universe but that they couldn't prove it.I was hoping for some substantive discussion of topics from the leading edges of science and philosophy such as Darwinian evolution vs intelligent design or the propects for the cloning of a human being. Or how about this: I believe that I exist but, on reflection, I realize that I can't prove it. Or, I believe I have free will but I can't prove it. Or I believe UFOs are piloted by non-human intelligent beings but I can't prove it."
4,Simple Yet Substantive,"Each chapter in this dandy book is only a few pages long, yet it has the potential to open your mind to novel, iconoclastic thinking. As someone who holds a faith in God, I also found it refreshing to read how much scientists believe but cannot prove."
4,good for collectors,"I thought this book would be more than it was. But I still liked it because many answers were provocative and interesting. So many scientists are atheists and they occasionally pontificate (see H.Kimble), but at least they are slightly educated and using reason and established facts, unlike the vast majority of 'other' people who pontificate.There were a few things I didn't like. First, there is no apparent order to the table of contents. Second, too many of the people believe the same things and it got a little repetitive.I would recommend this book for a fun, thought-provoking quick read."
3,Good but not great,"As a scientist I approached this book with a lot of expectations. I wanted to know what the greatest minds in science believe but cannot prove. I was expecting a lot of cutting edge topics and revolutionary ideas. Yes, there are some pieces that fulfilled and even exceeded my expectations, but there were also others that I couldn't even get past the first paragraph.I guess it is always difficult to put together a book with so many contributors and the result is always going to be a mix of, in this case, brilliant ideas and not so surprising monologues."
3,Interesting and erratic,"A bit disappointing. I thought that this would be a really special book, and I found it quite erratic. Some of the thinkers seem to have taken this very seriously, while others have not spent more than 10 minutes in this (that is not necessarily a bad thing). There are many repetitions, and some answers do not fit well in the book. Anyway, there are some very interesting ideas and clever answers, such as those given by Seth Lloyd, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and others that made the book worth reading."
2,Disappointed,"Overall I was pretty disappointed with the book. Most of the entries are short and therefore not very well developed. Some were still interesting, but I found that it couldn't really hold my attention, even to just pick up and read a few at a time. Maybe I am just too picky, but when I read the opinions of ""today's leading thinkers"" I want something more than ""tell me in 500 words or less""."
1,Mostly arrogant drivel,"Mostly atheists pontificating. Not at all what I had hoped for. The majority of the contributors aren't even, what I would consider to be, highly educated people.Don't waste your time."
2,Not what the title infers.,"The title of this book infers that it will help the reader take ideas from the drawing board to a finished piece. I expected insight on how to overcome problems in jewelry design and specific techniques to aid in solving those problems. Unfortunately, that's not what the book delivers. There are a lot of slick photos of some rather bizarre jewelry, but not much information about how the pieces were made. If you are a budding jewelry maker in search of a book to help you create some original jewelry, skip this one."
2,Could not wait to return the book,Really did not like the book -- half of the pictures of such ugly strange unrealistic jewelry... Returned the book at once... Highly recommend this one instead: Techniques of Jewelry Illustration & Color Rendering by Adolfo Mattiello.
4,"Wow, what an awesome resource.","This book is fantastic as a teaching resource. I mostly bought it for my own jewellery making practice but some of the pages will be of great use in my technology classes. Some of the jewellery is very unusual but I didn't buy it for the designs themselves, but rather the process of designing. I highly recommend this book for that purpose and am so glad I bought it. The only negative thing would be the size of it. For some reason I assumed for the price (more than I usually pay) I thought it would be bigger."
4,GRRRREAT!!,"This is a great halloween CD, Or just to listen to. The first CD features great songs like Thriller, Welcome To My Nightmare, Monster Mash, and much more! Second CD is good for a Haunted House or Halloween party."
1,1 lb. is not 8 oz. - misleading or mistake whichever,"When you search for baking powder this price stands out because it says it is a 1 lb. Then in product review it states there are 8 oz. in the bag. Also if you enlarge the photo, you can see there are 8 ounces. If Amazon changes/corrects the error here, go ahead and delete this review. The added comment suggests they may send two bags. However, this is the information given (shipping weight is under 1 lb.):Product DescriptionBaking Powder, 8 oz.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Product DetailsItem Weight: 8 ouncesShipping Weight: 12.8 ounces (View shipping rates and policies)"
3,"Arrived in great condition, haven't read it yet.","I've heard of this legend, and wanted to know the facts behind it. Great buy for that purpose."
2,Although speaker sound is good.,"For a small speaker I do agree the sound is good. However, it did not (Perhaps I read the description wrong) come ""with"" a dc plug. You can buy a converter so that may not be a biggie for most folks. There were ""no"" instructions included at all. Of course it's a simple little product and I can't say there is a big reason to include much detail. If you are looking for something to take on a camping trip or mayby even to play your Ipod in the garage it's not a bad system. But, if you are looking for a really good charger with a nice playback feature and even a few bells and whistles this is not for you. Overall, I can't give it a great review but for the money I can't complain much about it either."
5,Favorite Childhood Memory Ever,I sometimes find myself humming songs from this album at odd times. It fills me with a sense of nostalgia for simpler times. Times when I had a record player that slid under my bed. Times when I would listen to songs and sing them with my little brother and times when I could sit and read along with in a book with the songs from the record.Thank you for reminding me of these times. Does anyone know if this record is available on CD?
4,"Solid effort, not to my taste though","Jo Sharp's Knitted Sweater Style may be just what some knitters want -- three dozen quality patterns. Most are multi-color intarsia efforts (Sharp's signature) for advanced knitters. There are several single color efforts suitable for advanced beginners and up.My reservations about buying this book are threefold. First, I tend to shy away from expensive books that are just patterns. Unlike Meg Swansen's Knitting, this book doesn't have much in the way of technique tips or other timeless hints that I can use in my general knitting. Secondly, published in 1997, the designs are already looking a little dated. Third, there are better books out there for inspiration on colorwork. Kaffe Fassett's books are much more likely to provoke artistry. Sally Melville's Styles is a much more helpful guide for color combining and stash reduction.So, a book to enjoy and buy if the designs really catch your fancy."
5,Exceptional!,This book speaks for many fathers you are not allowed to be in their childrens life. My own husband is going through this same thing. His pain is the same as Mr. Bryans in this book. Mark Bryan is the voice of many fathers who need to be heard. I pray the mothers of these children listen to their crys. The child is the one who suffers the most. It is time these former wifes understand this.
2,"Good in theory, bad in practice","When I read the reviews of this book, I got interested and purchased the book. The book was a disappointment. It may be a good academic book and relate to the CMM, but it does not provide any guidelines as to how to deal with the details of what you encounter in projects in real life. I wonder if these techniques have really been applied in real life. There is much discussion of methods, but little on what it takes to use the methods. The book does not handle the many issues that arise when you try to manage a lot of work, with few staff, and not enough time. Very disappointing."
4,A Must for the *True* Journey Fan,"Although the song selection ranges all over the spectrum from Journey's early pre-Steve days through the ""Tron"" soundtrack and beyond, as a Journey fan I heartily say ""Buy it!"" But, for people who don't really know the band or appreciate the changes the music went through over the many years and lineups, ""Greatest Hits"" is probably a better place to start. Three CD's *is* a lot of you don't know many of the songs. For Journey fans, there are a bunch of unreleased tracks (such as ""Liberty"") and some other live recordings. Good Stuff!"
1,Disappointed,"After reading the review Salome Soars. I held a samll party to view it. We were all disappinted.The production attempted to be different. It is different and it succeeded in being unpleasant.Almost everything seemed wrong with it. John the Baptist was well acted, but the dialog refers to his white skin, he needed white body makeup. The prison guards and the leering soldiers were also good. However the background music was poor and the acting was grotesque. Salome's dance was mostly grotesque body movements.By comparison the production by Gotz Friedrich was everything that this isn't.

5,Awesome bone for a busy dog!,My crazy 3 year old dog loves these bones! Keeps him busy for a good chunk of time. I think he likes that the pieces move in different directions. Highly recommend them.
2,"JACK SAYS ""HUH""?","MY DOG JACK DOESN'T GET IT. HE LIKED GETTING IT AND OPENING THE PACKAGE, BUT PUT IT DOWN AND NEVER TOUCHED IT AGAIN. ALL IT DOES IS WIGGLE A LITTLE - NOT MUCH LIKE A PUZZLE. IT'S PRETTY AND WELL MADE BUT DIDN'T GO OVER VERY WELL."
2,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"This is a course text book and does not come with the solution files to the exams found at the end of each lesson. After speaking with a rep from Thompson Learning - the book's publisher - I was advised that the solution files were part of the instructor package, and was not available to individuals. In other words, if you are not a certified instructor, or part of an instructor led course that features this book, you will not be able to measure your progress from the exams in the book.I found speaking to the reps of Thompson Learning to be a particularly frustrating experience as I was treated rudely by both reps I spoke to. They offered absolutely no help whatsoever.The book, in itself, is very well written and easy to follow. However, if you are not part of an instructor led course that features this book with access to the solution files, you may want to invest your money elsewhere.As for this buyer, Thompson Learning is a definite two thumbs down."
5,Awesome Text for Beginners,"This text is quite a piece to carry around - over 900 pages - but the structure is ideal for folks who are interested enough to teach themselves Visual Basic 6 without the benefit of an instructor looking over their shoulders.The book takes readers through a wide variety of practical exercises in interface planning, coding and debugging, without boring you to death with unnecessary commentary. It gets right to the meat of things; it stimulates interest; and it holds interest.I recommend it highly."
1,Not For Beginners,"This book definitely seems to assume a lot of prior knowledge. It seems as if the projects at the end of chapters have nothing to do with what was just covered. It's like there are missing codes. I'm a computer teacher, and I am in the process of trying to find the teacher's edition to this just to try to help me better understand it. I am also taking courses toward an e-commerce degree, and this book makes it difficult when it comes to applying the knowledge."
2,"Easy to Follow, But...","Yes the book is fairly easy to follow, but the tutorials ask you to perform tasks that are not possible with the supplied software.Don't waste your time trying to learn from this book unless it is required for a class!Besides VB6.0 has reached the end of the support life cycle, and it doesnt run on xp 64bit."
4,A bargain,"I got this movie for $2 on Amazon. If you watch and wait it is a near freebie. Any movie with Hedy Lamarr in color alone is worth the price, but this one is not a bad little western either. Ray Milland is good as the lead, but McDonald Carey is particularly good as the bad guy. For Carey it is a bit of a revelation for most of us who remember him as the patriarch of ""Days of Our Lives"". They make the most of the chemistry between Lamarr and Milland and the undercurrent of distrust and betrayal throughout. This is not a great western, but at the price you can not go wrong."
2,Low Grade Movie,"Not a movie I would order again, nor do I plan to watch it a second time. The action is slow and very predictable, and the character of the stars is never developed. Ray Milland tries hard to make his character interesting, but he just can't beat the way the movie is directed. Pretty B-Grade and silly."
5,Free version on Wizards site: but softbound book is great,"Because this book is part of the 2nd edition stuff, Wizards of the Coast put the PDF up on their free downloads site at wizards.com ... which means you can legally read the book and see if it's something you want to purchase. It's easier to use in campaigns if you have the bound book, but the download is a great way to start.Robynnsemberholme.com"
3,First purchase of Hapa,"After hearing a selection by Hapa else where I bought 3 CD's to study the style and variety of performances. This CD gives a good variety, but is not as enjoyable for me as the ""Maui"" CD by Hapa."
3,Jury still out on Bella B BrightEyes,"It's been only a few weeks since I started using this product - and, truth be told, I use it along with another under-eye cream - so I can't really vouch for its efficacy. I will say, though, that it has a rather unusual [?!] scent, and that I wish the list of ingredients on the back of the jar were easier to decode.Good luck!"
4,Parker Varsity Soccer Shinguard,This is only shin guard my daughter will wear. She loves the custom fit and the breathability of the product. It only takes 20 minutes to custom form the product to your shins! They stay put comfortably for hours. They last several years.
5,one of the 2 that I will always keep,"for anybody needing good solid instructions, that not only tell you what you need to do, but also why, this book is for you.it follows the process of making both a steal string acoustic and a classical guitar from start (actually before, from preparation) to completion. It gives thorough instructions, but allows you to make alterations and changes as you see fit, so it is not a 'paint by the numbers' type of guide. If you need to be hand held to the point of having the author make all of the decisions for you, then this is not your book. If you just need a solid guide to outline the steps, in comprehensive detail, and point out the pitfalls along the way, then buy it now.I will warn you that it does seem a bit dated, but the instruments, the tools, and of course the materials have not changed at all since this writing, so it is as valid today as the day that it was written."
3,"Fine book, lots of detail",This is a fine book on guitar building (a little dated). It has lots of detail and is broken into logical and digestible chapters. My only complaint is all the pictures are black and white. While still good I think color photos would have been better.
3,Not for a begineer in this decade,"This is almost two books in one. One is classical guitar building one is steel string.As a book I used in the shop, the duality made it hard to follow. The authors also assume you already have woodworking skills and tools. For a beginner there are better and easier ways to do things.Many of the techniques and materials suggested are outdated.That being said, this is the most thorough step by step book available.I bet this book would have been great, when it was first written.There is a huge amount of information out there, on updated techniques, especially jigs and fixtures for the beginner, they just aren't in one place.If someone doesn't beat me to it, I might write a book on this subject, because a current, and complete how-to for beginners does not exist.All that being said, you should buy this book, but you also need to get several others as well as consulting internet sources and forumns."
5,God Bless you Jonathan and William,"In my opinion this is the preeminent volume on guitar construction available, bar none. There is a reason this book is referenced by more builders than any other.Although several reviewers felt the organization of the text was disjointed or hard to follow, I disagree. After having built a guitar I believe it couldn't have been organized any better. My only suggestion to those who have not yet read the book, is to carfully follow each and every word! The authors have been very deliberate in their instructions, and each sentence should be given attentive thought, and due diligence. I can't stress this enough. When you've finished your first guitar you'll be on your knees thanking them."
4,"Excellent resource for guitarmaking, but disorganized","This really is a great book, but since it is written for building both classical and steel-string guitars, I find myself jumping from section to section to find measurements, tips, instructions, etc. It doesn't really flow well, but it is currently my #1 reference for guitar-making. I also highly recommend Irving Sloane's book."
5,Perhaps the finest textbook I have read on any subject,"I have been repairing guitars for nearly 15 years, and successfully completed several electric guitars, yet had not attempted an acoustic instrument. I have found this book to be an outstanding resource to me as a luthier, with a level of detail and thoroughness seldom seen in books of this kind. Often the author is too familiar with the subject to realize that they have left out critical details which are obvious to them by merit of experience, but without which a beginner is lost. Mr. Cumpiano's attention to detail helps a seasoned craftsman to achieve professional results, but he always manages to offer a simpler approach to each procedure for the beginner to more easily grasp. I hope he is inspired to write a sequel!"
3,Smart Bubblegum,"So in the early '90's the enigmatic Lawrence put his Television-inspired act Felt to rest and created Denim. Gone were Felt's sprays of thin guitar lines and understated vocals and in their place came crunchy, fat chords, lyrics that were decade-obsessed, big, '70's dance party drum beats and an overall feel of a smartypants doing bubblegum. Most of these songs just don't go much of anyplace, and many are about three minutes too long (including some which are three minutes or so long). But ""Bubblehead"" is an irresisitible pop gem with a guitar groove that won't quit and a melody that will have you humming along. And ""The Osmonds"" is notable just for its lyrical content, particularly the lines ""And in the '70's there were Osmonds, lots of little Osmonds, there were lots of Osmonds everywhere."" This is not as good as Felt records but Lawrence enthusiasts will want to pick it up, and it's a keeper if only for the sake of ""Bubblehead."""
2,"Catty, Pastiche-Rock","Denim are good songwriters. But the sarcasm and irony and the cheeky Lou Reed imitation wear thin, very quickly. There are some fantastic melodies on here that could have been worthwhile, if they had been written with an ounce of sincerity behind them. If you make joke-rock, at least do it with an original sound, not with a self-righteous mockery of the 70's and 80's."
5,This book changed my life.,"Pretty much everything I had written before it was thrown in the wastebasket, along with all the bad habits T.S. Eliot inspires. After 5 years of constant scribbling, I was back to square one--I was suddenly thrust into the no-nonsense world of classical discipline from the artsy-fartsy realms of my baroque youth. Ten years later, I'm still learning from this book. It'll teach you more than a silly English degree from your local silly university, and costs much less--""The ABC of Reading"" is a condensed course in comparative literature."
1,"Great story, terrible kindle version","My kids love the tacky series, it's the kindle versions that suck. Yes, they suck. The images are photocopies of the printed book (small font text and all). Often the images do not even line up with the words. They spent as little time on layout as possible for this version of the book.There are some tacky kindle books that are good, but this one is not. Buy the printed book instead."
4,Wonderful,"I'm not sure how I first heard of her - I think I heard a bit of an interview with her on BBC Radio Scotland's country show (I'm not kidding - it's a great show).Anyways, she was wonderful, as is this album.PK"
1,Misses the mark,"The book fails to capture the reason the Macintosh become popular in the first place. Just the title of the book denote's Jim Carlton's bias.Interestingly enough, his predictions of the future of Apple is ironically incorrect. Apple's recent comeback in the computer industry is a testiment to that."
1,The biggest blunder is this book,"I'm not a big Apple Computer fan, but I was very disappointed by this book. Covering the tumultuous period just before Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the book attempts to provide all the 20/20 insight necessary to explain the company's short-comings. Unfortunately, though, the book is so poorly written -- and doesn't at all hide the disdain the author feels for Jobs -- that it's nearly unreadable. Rather than tell the story in a linear timeline, the book jumps back and forth in a very confusing way. If you didn't already know the Apple story, you wouldn't know what was going on. Also, considering all the success Apple has had since then (with the iMac and Titanium PowerBook), this topic is moot now anyway."
4,"A great account of the biggest ""What If?"" ever",This book offers a great illustration of the personalities behind the decisions that led to Apple's near-demise. It's amazing that a company with so many bright people managed to spin its wheels for 10 years. It's also amazing that Apple is still around.
2,Very difficult to read,"This book offers some wonderful insights on how the former powerhouse, Apple, went to near bankruptcy in the early '90's. I found much of the information very intersting. The only problem was that I could not follow the book at all! The story seemed to jump all around with no clear direction. I often found myself reading along about the company in 1992, then suddenly find myself reading about what happened in 1989 in the next paragraph. I could not draw any line of cohesion in this book, which is truly a shame. With better organization, this could have been a very good book."
3,"Interesting, but hard to read ...","The book is not a pageturner and the style of it is very dry. Mr. Carlton is journalist for the WSJ and this is his first book - got the idea?But the information about past decisions made at Apple Computer, makes every Apple fan nearly whining and so it is a must-read. This book is sometimes a 101 in stupid management decisions! E.g. how to finance a multi-million research project and then kill it immediately, because someone without technical and/or marketing knowledge says ""No"". Or, how to ignore your best friends (MetroWorks), or - even better - make them hating your company (Adobe, Microsoft).If you would like to start-up the next computer company, are working as a VC or just bleed in Apple colours, then please read the book ... and you will understand every decision made by Steve Jobs!!!"
1,Error! Crash(ing bore),"Carlton takes one of the most fascinating legends of corporate America and turns it into a snooze-fest. He never manages to illustrate why Apple and the Macintosh were exciting and why their fans are like religious zealots - he just states it as a foregone conclusion and then gets back to documenting the endless corporate blunders. Which is important, but you have to know why Apple matters (mattered?) to find the blunders significant (or tragic). His writing is dull and sometimes downright strange -- one scene is set at a fancy Valley restaurant, and he pointedly notes that this restaurant offered escargot as an appetizer. I assumed the snails would figure prominently later in the anecdote (perhaps they were the inspiration for the current G3 campaign?) but THEY NEVER COME UP AGAIN. It's like he was just flummoxed by the existence of escargots and had to share his excitement. Wait for the movie."
1,"A Great Story, written like a first draft by a novice.","I assume that Carlton's editors were not available to ""edit"" as this book is so poorly written and constructed that I gave up half way through (and wanted to much sooner). An example: How many times do we have to hear about how strangely Spindler acts or Sculley's health? Just once if it's only going to be brought up over and over and over and over and over and over (etc.) again like we hadn't just read about it in the last chapter (or page). This is one of the most fascinating corporate stories to tell and unfortunately, Carlton is over his head in the telling. A complete and total waste of time and money. Geez, I hope they don't try and make an $80 million movie out of this turkey. If only Tom Wolfe had done it."
1,I guess you had to be there...,"With all due respect, an absolutely unappealing telling of the woeful tale of Apple's decline and fall. With a preponderance of quotes and footnotes citing other authors' books, I suggest cutting to the chase and reading the very best book on the subject of Silicon Valley including Apple, Robert X. Cringley's ""Accidental Empires:How the Boys of Silicon Valley Make Their Millions, Battle Foreign Competition, and Still Can't Get a Date."""
2,facts are outdated and flawed,"although this book was extremely informative and interesting, its facts were outdated, and occasionally flawed. parts of this book seem to have been written circa 1996, and other parts (many about the mac os itself) are just plain wrong. the only fact in the way of the alleged ""demise"" of apple is that there are too many fanatics who would rather die than use windows. macs are easier to use and have better graphics features than many other platform (including windows), which still makes them the top choice for many schools and most graphic professionals. since jobs' ""return"" to apple, it has been apparent that wonderful changes have been made. stock has risen, prices have lowered, quarterly profit has been announced, and over 100,000 imacs have already been pre-ordered. apple is definetely headed on the right track, and under jobs' leadership, it can go even further. it's not ""over"" for apple, it's merely a new beginning."
1,A close minded look into the computer industry,This book will leave you with an unsettled feeling concerning how decisions are made in competitive industries in general. I give it two thumbs down.
2,A Tough Read For All But The Most Dedicated,"Jim Carlton's book takes a fascinating story and re-tells it - badly.The prose is deadly, even when the story is at its most compelling. Anyone who is familiar with the years of failure and foul-ups at Apple will find little that is truly new or original here, but anyone else will be appalled at the way the company threw away opportunity after opportunity.Having said that, Apple's story is not only a story of failure, it is also a story of success - just think of the great products the company has put out. Jim Carlton pays no attention to that. The book is a depressing read because it only sounds the one note: failure, failure, failure. And that is as hard on Apple as it is on the reader.The bottom line: would I recommend this book to a friend? No."
3,"flawed, finnicky but not far off the mark","jim carlton's book is neither great nor bad.it's interesting and at times repetitive, that's right repetitive. whilst some of our fellow amazonians are slagging it -be fair, wouldn't you rather read it now as a book than later as a tombstone epitaph? and that old saying ""the truth hurts"" goes a long way to explain the mixed reviews.pay the money and read carlton's book -to save your own company or to learn more about the apple icon that is part of all of our livesjohn buck"
3,An overly melodramatic commentary,"Complete with numerous incorrect analogies and weak metaphors, this books seems to be abound with skewed perspectives and ""cartoonish exaggerations"" of Apple. All togeather a poorly done ""narrative"" on Apple's past."
2,"Guy's wrong..it's poorly written, repetitive & disorganized.","Most of the reviews on this book are correct. The author shows how Apple was rotting but avoids making a more insightful analysis of the players and the industry involved. The book is poorly written, repetitive, disorganized, and not very focused on the important issues (this is similar to much of the reporting on Apple in the Journal and other major papers). Some passages even seem to reveal a lack of understanding of aspects of computing with heinous oversimplifications of certain events in the industry. I'm sorry that Guy Kawasaki (if the review is really his) thinks it's a well written book. The only part I thought was well written was Kawasaki's forward!"
4,Helpful introduction to Augustine,"Bentley-Taylor's book is short [166 pages of text] and easy to read. It includes a plentiful supply of short quotations from Augustine, tells the story of his life and gives an introduction to his writings. It is written from an evangelical point of view, but the author's theological perspective is not intrusive.In the course of telling the story, he mentions lots of names of people from Augustine's times who modern readers will not be familiar with. This may be necessary, but it would be helpful if he had told us a little more about some of these people, as on occasion, the story seems to be little more than a string of names.The author is not afraid to tell us where he thinks Augustine made mistakes. He is also fairly generous with him, and explains that many of Augustine's quirky ideas [to us today] are a product of his times.I highly recommend the book as a simple introduction to one of the most important people in Christian history."
4,Augustine the Man,"Good book with lots of information. Not a heavy read, but best read by serious students.Lots of historical info about the people and times that Augustine lived in.One example was the description of a Goth leader who threatened Africa. The Goth's ships were wrecked in a storm. The followers of this leader diverted a river's flow, buried the guy in the river bed, and then let the river run back in the original bed. Then all the people who had worked to divert the flow were killed in order to keep the site a secret.Lots of good insight into St Augustine and his views about common place things in life.Overall a good book. Short, only about 170 pages. A couple of drawings and maps at the back help the reader understand the geography of the Mediteranean/North Africa area."
1,Outdated for this current market 2010,"This book is outdated for this current real estate market.Pros: day 1 through day 40 to do list and ""New Investor mistakes pg 209""Cons:Tax liens and IRS sales are NOT for new investors!!, Driving neighbors is time consuming and a waist of time if your looking to find a deal. its good if you want to sight see, not for hunting deals. Dialing for dollars? try it and post your results.After buying this book and following the 40day plan, I got the same results as the Carlton Sheets course.when looking for an investing book, make sure the use of technology is incorporated within the system with resources listed to call if you need additional information."
5,Sun Signs Moon Signs,"Why is this book out of print? I've been an astologer for over 30 years, and you don't often come across an astrology book the likes of this one. Shockingly accurate, perceptive commentaries,dealing with the true underself, with a point of view that is both absolutely illuminating, and full of depth. I am going right now to the search engines to see what other information I can get on this author to further my own knowledge."
5,Yet another wolf in sheep's clothing,"Stunningly perceptive, Andersen wrote a work of great insight. I am usualy skeptical about astrology and astrologers, but this book is meaningful."
1,Not what I expected or wanted,"Flag was a cheap imitation of what was wanted/needed for flying outdoors. I do not recommend this product, unless you are going to have a cheap wall imitiation in your house."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I've never used a bread mix for a bread maker before, much less a gluten-free one. Since the bread maker wasn't the latest model (Toast Master 2 lb. 'Bread Box'), it had NO directions for gluten-free bread. I was worried about outcome. There are several ""directions"" for different types of bread. I started with and used the directions for 'white sandwich bread'. No problem. Everything worked great and I ended with a good tasting, nice textured loaf of bread. Very pleased with mix and outcome. It tasted better than the gluten-free loaf we bought!"
5,Delicious Sandwich Bread Mix,"This is the best GF bread mix I've used, although I didn't think so after the first time I baked it. It was under baked, very dense and heavy. After a few more tries I have a great recipe for a success: first I use more liquid (2 cups), add 4 tbsp ground flax seed and extend baking time to 40-42 minutes. I baked it in an electric oven and in gas and both do great job."
4,Better than gluten-full bread!,"I absolutely LOVE this bread! I am the only one in my household with celiac disease and the only one who is gluten-free, but my whole family likes this bread better than store-bought gluten-full bread. It is not dense, dry, or crumbly at all, and when I have served it to people outside my family, they couldn't even tell it was gluten-free! This is by far the best gluten-free bread I have found.One tip - it does seem to rise much better for me when I make it in the oven as opposed to my bread maker. A pastry chef had suggested to me that it may be because of the upright loaf pan (rather than a horizontal one) in my bread maker not allowing it to rise well, since gluten-free breads often have difficulty rising anyway.The only reason I did not give this bread 5 stars is because I am so disappointed that Amazon has removed it from their ""Subscribe & Save"" program. It is still much cheaper here than buying it in the stores, though."
3,not my favorite sandwich bread,"I'm not sure what the problem with this bread mix is. There appears to be too much batter for the specified 9x5 pan. It mushrooms up over the top and then while cooling the sides suck in. It seems to turn out better when baked in (2) 4x8 pans, but the sides and bottom still shrink in. All in all it's not a pretty loaf, but it is yummy fresh from the oven with peanut butter on it."
3,What happen to the old MIX,My girlfriend has been using the product for some time now. She has been on auto ship with Amazon. She just got a new shipment and the box has changed and it doesn't cook the same way the old mix did. She has tried a few times but it never comes out the same from the bread machine. I was wondering if anyone else has notice this change.John
3,Good Enough but not Great,"The bread made from this mix is tolerable, the mix is easy to prepare. I recommend slicing the bread as thin as possible to avoid the gag reflex."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this bread mix due the high rated reviews. The mix made a beautiful loaf, but the flavor wasn't the greatest. The only way I was able to eat it, was to pile it with peanut butter and jelly. As stated by one of the reviews it also contains milk, I'm lactose intolerant. I will give Pamela's a try."
4,The best gluten free bread I have ever eaten,"To date, this is the beat gluten free bread I have ever eaten and it can be easily made in your bread machine. In the refrigerator, the bread will keep for weeks without molding."
1,WTF Dairy???,"My husband and I just made a batch of this bread, and while it smells and tastes amazing, the fact that is contains ""skim milk"" and ""whey"" means that my neither of my kids can have it!!! I suppose this is a lesson in reading every label before purchasing--I've been spoiled by Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free Bread."
4,Easy to make...,"This is a good neutral tasting bread and holds together for sandwiches better than others. Best taste in ""sandwich"" bread category I've found in gluten free. Easy to make. Would recommend."
4,Good Gluten-Free Bread Mix,"My husband likes this GF mix. He uses the ""white bread"" setting on the bread machine, instead of the GF setting. The GF setting did not produce good results."
4,GF Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread,"My husband and 3 of our 4 kids were recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease. It's been a struggle to feed the crew but discovering this product has been a big help. We actually did a bake off with 3 different brands and no question Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich bread was the winner. Once in a while we use their French bread mix for variety. If you're new to this gluten free thing my advice is to buy a bread machine with a delay timer, load it up before you go to bed and when you wake up you'll have a nice, fresh loaf of bread. When it's just made it's great. Later you'll need to toast it. We also make French toast and grilled cheese sandwiches from this and the kids feel like their back to being regular members of the eating world!"
4,"nearly foolproof mix, low on flavor","I've had great success with this mix in my zojirushi bread machine. Ithe mix comes with a premeasured packet of yeast to which you simply add milk or water, eggs, and oil or butter. I have made bread with milk and butter and also with water and oil. I don't notice much difference between types.the loaf produced rises well, bakes quickly and has a fantastic crust. I find the plain white recipe lacking slightly in flavor, but have done well adding Italian spices/garlic/onion powder twosome loaves, and cinnamon and sugar to others.All in all this is a perfect loaf of bread for my gluten free kids' lunches. I bake a loaf on Sunday night and we slice off of it all week. the texture is excellent and the bread hold up well, no toasting required."
5,The best!,"If you don't have time to make your own bread mix... or haven't perfected the flour mix yet (and it is an art) then this it the next best thing! It tastes like ""real"" bread! I've fooled many a gluten eater with this bread. I love to throw it in the bread machine and come home to freshly made bread (or wake up to it)!I can't rave enough. Locally I pay 6-7 dollars a box, so this is great deal!"
5,"Great, quick bread!","We use this mix when I'm strapped for time. It's quick and easy and is our favorite alternative to my own recipe. I add 1/4 cup of sweet dairy whey which adds to the taste and texture! My entire family likes this bread, even my picky hubby! It makes a great sandwich, perfect french toast and UNBELIEVABLE grilled cheese!"
1,This is supposed to be bread?,"Sure, this bread is good if you like having your ham & cheese between two slices of pound cake. I was not happy with this product at all. It was very cake like, but besides that the taste was awful. I will be making croutons out of it, hopefully I can mask the taste with loads of garlic."
2,Good Bread But EXPENSIVE!,"I have used this bread and I like it very much. The taste and texture are great and the bread is a little easier to make than Bob's Red Mill.When you add the shipping cost to the price of the bread, the result is an astonishing $6.61 per loaf! I will continue to buy this mix from my local stores."
3,EASY and convenient,"Fluffy, it isn't, but the loaf rises and keeps well, tastes 'fair-to-middling'. It makes quite a decent sandwich compared to any recipe I have tried in the past 11 years - and believe me, I have tried a LOT of recipes... I just think it is pretty pricey, not cheap, but cheaper than buying all those different GF flours, only to turn out a pathetic, crumbly & peculiar-tasting loaf. So far, this is the best alternative I have found."
5,This IS the best!,I have tried many recipes and mixes over the last year. Nothing compares to this bread!
1,PRICING COMPLAINT ONLY,I love this bread and have been using it for years. I used to order it here utilizing the subscribe and save feature. Those days are now over at this price of $43.25 for 6. I also use Bob's Red Mill bread mix so My bread options are not limited.Gluten Free Pantry sells this for $23.94 plus $13.98 shipping. HUH??? Outrageous!Amazon pricing even with the subscribe and save feature still equates to about $5.00 more in total than GFP.Amazon just lost my business with this product. Walmart pricing is currently $4.29 per box in my area. I will stock up today before their pricing goes up.Please note that my prices mentioned here may be plus or minus a few cents. I am going from memory in the last few minutes. :)
5,Delicious!! Best bread mix out there.,"I've tried a few different bread mixes and recipes using gluten-free flour, and I think this mix is by far the best. No gluten-free bread tastes the same as bread made with wheat flour, but this bread is just as good. My bread machine doesn't have a gluten-free setting, so I used the Quick Bread setting and it came out perfect. The only thing I had to do was to scrape down the sides of the bread pan a couple of times during the process. Great texture and flavor. After eating this, I don't miss ""real"" bread at all!!"
4,The best all purpose gluten-free sandwich bread,This always comes out tasting great. What I really wanted it for was to make french toast and it's great for that but it's just great out of the fridge.
5,Simply THE best GF bread anywhere,"I have been cooking and baking as well as buying products that are gluten free for 15 years. This is absolutely the best Gluten free bread I have ever seen , including those available from bakeries or in stores. I mixed all the ingredients together, not even taking care to beat the eggs separately, etc. Baked it for an hour. Presto. The best looking best tasting GF loaf we have ever seen. As a bonus, the loaf was a normal size, and much better for slicing for sandwiches. Although we often use storebought (eg Ener-G tapioca), the size of the slices on ready-made GF bread is ridiculously small.More importantly the texture of this bread was perfect. and the bread was totally flexible, no crumbling whatsoever. Sliced up like 'normal' bread, no falling apart."
4,Was a great bread and buy -- for four months,"I liked the GF Pantry bread mix so well I signed up to have automatic deliveries. Unfortunately, after my initial purchase, I only received one additional shipment before the offer was discontinued and the price of the product went up considerably! I liked this brand because it has reasonably good texture and taste (compared with regular bread) and for a gluten-free it required minimal additional (and less costly) ingredients compared to other mixes I've tried. For now, I'm experiencing with other GF bread mixes I hadn't tried earlier and am leaning towards ""Pamela's."" One other note on the ""Pantry's"" mix, IMO the bread's texture is better and it freezes better if it isn't cooked as long as directed."
5,An appropriate item for Gluten Free people,"I have been making this bread for over 6 years for my son. It is a simple and straight forward item, and the variety of other products in the Gluten Free Pantry are good also. The flavor and texture of the bread is great, toasts (taoster oven is a best way) well, and make a mean grilled cheese. The subscription cost of the case from Amazon underscores the shelf price at the stores, and is worth looking in to. I make 2 boxes at a time, slice & freeze for 10-14 days of bread to use.The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)"
5,Wonderful gluten free bread mix from Amazon.com,"This bread mix makes a great loaf of gluten free bread. I have been on a gluten free diet for the past 7 years, and have tried most of the bread mixes, and found this product to be the tastiest. The subscription order, which saves 15% on the cost, and arrives automatically on a regular basis, is just great. Thank you Gluten Free Pantry and Amazon."
5,LOVE this Bread!,"Gluten Free Panrty mixes are the honestly the best GF bread mixes available. I can purchase this at my local grocery store, but its very pricey. I've had other brands and they can't hold a candle to this brand. It will take a lot to get me to change."
4,Arrived as expected. As good as expected.,"This bread is great if you are on the wheat-free diet. It is easy to fix in a bread machine, using the machine's gluten-free directions as directed. I have to use a little less liquid, but my book tells me that. It is easy to cut thin slices of this bread and use it for toasting for breakfast. I try not to go overboard, but a slice of bread is nice every now and then. Slice it and freeze it for future use. I have tried with oil and butter and find I prefer the oil. Experiment on different loaves to see what you like."
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PRICE???,"The price was considerably better a while back at $19.44. How can they figure the original price was $6.30 per bag, when the company who manufacture's this product sells it for $3.99 per bag plus shipping. For the price they are charging now, I can get it at my local healthfood store for much less. The product is excellent and have used it for many years, but Amazon's price is not a deal anymore!"
4,Begin With This,"This is perhaps the easiest, most neutral tasting GF bread mix I have tried yet. It was the first I bought, and it made my GF transition much simpler.You CAN mix this by hand. I tried a single box first to be sure, then came here and ordered a case. It makes a large, 'normal' looking loaf of bread. The texture is wonderful for the first 2-3 days, then I slice what's left and store in my freezer until I need another slice. Try the Cinnamon Raisin bread recipe and make french toast for a real treat! Play around with the recipe. Try it with milk, then water. Try it with butter, then oil. Eggs, or egg-less. My personal combo is oil, eggs, and 3/4 water to 1/4 milk.The cons? A bit crumbly, and not enough 'chew' to the bread to pretend you are eating a rustic bread. All and all though...you can't go wrong starting your gluten free journey here."
5,Great Product at Totally Awesome Price,"This is the best mix I have ever tried. The bread is far better than store bought. And there is nothing like warm butter bread. Find a good used bread maker, clean it up really good and you can easily make your own gluten free bread. You don't need one of those expensive specialty ones. Just use white bread with medium crust setting for gluten free bread."
4,That's Bob Wills,"The guy going ""Waa"" is actually Bob Wills. Tommy Duncan handles the actual singing. Wills was essentially the Flavor Flav of the 1940s. Like Chuck D said when asked what Flavor Flav contributes to Public Enemeny, ""I don't what it is, but it's something."" Those ""Aw Yeahs"" are actually left over from Wills' vaudeville days doing minstrel acts in Dallas. The orgins of his lingo may make a lot of people cringe, but I find it hard to believe Wills was racist. After all he frequent payed homage to the great jazz greats of this century, most of whom were black.As for this CD, I have a lot of problems with record labels trying to sell their particular slice of an artist's catalogue as the ""essential"" music of a performers career. All of the songs are great, but there's a lot missing. This should be called Bob Wills: the Columbia Years."
4,THE PLAYBOYS EARLY STUFF,"THIS IS A NICE COLLECTION OPF RECORDINGS BY BOB WILLS AND THE TEXAS PLAYBOYS, THE EARLY VERSION OF THE BAND, AND SOME OF THEIR EARLIEST RECORDINGS. IT SWINGS, IT'S GREAT, AND YOU CAN SEE WHY THEY WERE THE KINGS OF WESTERN SWING MUSIC. I HAVE A LOT OF BOB WILLS CD'S, AND I PREFER HIS LATER RECORDINGS, THERE IS A NINE CD SERIES CALLED THE ""TIFFANY TRANSCRIPTIONS"" WHICH ARE LATER RECORDINGS AND SWING JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THIS..........."
4,"Great music, but has some quirks","Don't get me wrong---I like this CD and really enjoyed it as an introduction to western swing. But most of the songs' lyrics are punctuated with some guy going ""waa!"" in the background, which is kind of funny at first, but tiresome over the whole album. I appreciate that this may be one of the charms of western swing for some, but to me it sounds like they had a drunken ninja singing along with them. In a lot of ways, I feel like the musicianship of the playboys is the star here, not the lyrics or singing."
5,Beautiful blessings,"I discovered this gem of a book when I was looking for blessings I could use at home. The blessings, prayers and meditations are moving and very usable. The book itself is beautiful, with the medieval illustrations and the look of the pages. When I read it I feel as if I have been taken back in time, when books as an art form were valued. As a rabbi, I am often in search of books of blessings I can recommend to congregants looking for something they can use that will enhance their personal lives at work or home. This is definitely that book. I love it, and congregants have loved it too."
5,Sofft London Mule,I bought these clogs and I love them. They are very comfortable and stylish. They run a little big I bought a 1/2 size smaller than normal. They are very well made.
3,"Okay, not great.",It's very spicy but not necessarily flavorful. I had to add salt which I don't usually do. My children wouldn't eat it because it was too spicy and neither would my mom. I will finish what I purchased but probably won't buy more.
4,LensPEN,"I bought this to clean my lenses for my T3i. I decided to pick it up because of all the positive reviews and it helped that it was cheap.I have used it a couple times so far and I must say, it does work quite well.The only reason why I give it 4/5 stars is because sometimes after use, I would see some left over carbon residue or something on the lens. I would have to take the pen to the lens again to get it off."
5,Mine's Definitely Genuine,"After reading some of the reviews here, I was paranoid about getting a counterfeit. However, the knockoffs have become such a problem, that LensPen has a section on their website about how to identify the fakes - and the one I received meets all the criteria for being the real deal.As far as the LensPen concept itself - I haven't used anything else for ten years - it's just that good. From my $1400 Steiner binoculars to my Canon DSLR lenses, the LensPen has been my go-to tool for all lens cleaning.I've uploaded some pictures that show the features that identify it as genuine. If you get a counterfeit, hold Amazon's feet to the fire and make them deal with the problem."
4,"Convenient, works good","Works great on camera lenses, not so great on cell phones with protective plastic shields. Well worth buying for your camera. I'd buy it again."
2,"Not the real thing, but cheap.","The photo shown is deceptive. The item received is a cheap copy that does not clean as well as my, now four year old, genuine LensPEN. Especially on multi-coated filters, it leaves a smear that is hard to clear. The seller is prompt and the product arrived well packaged. I'm a bit surprised that the LensPEN company doesn't come after these folks for copyright infringement. I wouldn't buy again. It's worth noting that the seller tried to get me to change my review for a $4 refund."
1,Imitation Product,"I searched Amazon for ""LensPEN LP-1"" (the actual product name) and was brought to the page for this item. This is NOT a real LensPEN. It is a cheap Chinese knock-off. If you want the original item, keep searching because this isn't it. I don't know if this item actually works, because I won't risk using it on my very expensive equipment."
3,Not the item advertised,"I ordered this item with high hopes. And I am pretty sure my hopes would have been satisfied if I received the original LensPen product. However, what I received was indeed Sunpak LensPen. I am not sure if this is a re-branding of original lenspen similar to nikon lenspens. Nevertheless,it is definitely not the advertised item, although it works similarly."
4,Great cleaner,Works as advertised. Will get all dust and smudges of your glass.The only thing is that is could be a tab shorter to make it more travel friendly. Very very minor gripe though. Works well...
3,Very portable,This is a great little tool. Nice to have a brush and cloth in one thing and it fits nicely in my camera bag or just clipping it on the strap of my camera. I only with the brush end had some sort of cap. I always feel like the tip of the brush is getting dirty just by being exposed and something's going to attach to it and then I'm going to brush it on my lens and scratch it up.
2,Meh.,"It's alright.Nothing more than alright. Not really sure how it compares to other brushes, I guess every photographer needs something along these lines."
3,Lens Pen,The cleaning tip doesn't last long. I spend time in the jungle with dew and pollen getting onto my lenses. The pen brush stays clean in the case and I find it very useful for keeping my lenses dust free. The other end just takes up space.
3,Decent lens pen,"My only problem with this accessory is that the little pad on the cleaning end of the pen tends to come off when you apply even the slightest amount of pressure. Otherwise, it's been a pretty handy little accessory to have for cleaning the front elements of my lenses."
3,Practical equipment,"I believe it is necessary to have a device like this.Simple, practical, and does not occupy space.Make a quick and efficient cleaning."
4,Useful,"It is not all that well built, but is really useful and really cheap!! I bought this one to protect my lenses almost a year ago and I can say that it has helped me maintaining them in good shape."
2,The brush works. The pen doesn't.,"The brush works about as well as a brush can be expected to work. The carbon tip doesn't. Tried it on two lenses and the smudges and dried moisture spots went nowhere. Switched back to a microfiber cloth that did the job in ten seconds. I'll keep it in my bag because it's a decent brush and because there's little sense in putting in a lot of effort to return such a small item, but don't waste your money."
5,"Handy, well-designed little lens cleaner","This item gets a lot of use from me. I use it to clean camera lens surfaces and the red-dot sights for my firearms. All of these are high-dollar items, but I trust the LensPEN and it has not let me down. This product is easy to toss in the camera or range bag so that you have it when you need it. Recommended."
2,"NOT ""old version""!","I purchased 10 of these specifically because the description specifies that these are the 'old version' with the red accents and the snap-on cap, as opposed to the new version with the gold accents and the screw-on cap. I use these to clean my eyeglasses and very much prefer the snap-on lid version.BUT, what arrived today was 10 of the new version :/just a warning if you want the old version specifically."
1,DO NOT BUY,Made a screeching sound on my lens- I am pretty sure if I didn't stop it would have scratched the lens-Looked like chamois on rubber and the rubber was peeking through- HORRIBLE- threw it away can't even get a refund now:(
4,Great Item!,I love this pen! It is exactly what I needed to clean my lens in a hurry. The dual option of a brush and cleaning pad is perfect for making my lens shine.
3,Brush Works But Carbon End Wears Out Fast!,"I've had this brush for less than a month but it seems like the carbon end is wearing out already. The brush is still working fine and will remove any loose particles. However for the particles that need a little bit more scrubbing, the carbon end is needed. The carbon end will not last as long as the brush though!"
5,"Great product, essential with any camera/camcorder",The retractable soft bristle brush is indispensable for removing small stubborn particles that refuse to come off of glass when using a blower bulb. The carbon side helps gently clear anything that remains. love this little tool. I keep it in a small Ziplock in my camera bag at all times.
5,Excellent Product,"Recently on a whalewatching trip, I got some ocean water drops on my 135mm f2L. I was quickly able to wipe the drops and also used this LenPEN to get original shine free of smudges from the lens. This is excellent product, compact, solid and cleans as published. Its a must keep for all fingerprint and dust removal. One side it has a retractable brush and other a carbon compound cleaner. I don't want to use Lens filters etc as I want original pictures and let my canon 5DMarkII settings take care of pictures. So this is my excellent tool if anything gets on the lens. I cleaned dust from my camera too. Love It......."
4,one of the best,I haven't try a lot of lenses cleaners but reviewed alot. Now I have this one and its mandatory and no need for spraying.
3,OK,"The felt tip works good, but parts of the brush come off on your lens.It's good for a quick clean.I wish I would have looked at the shipping charges closer, it was almost as much as the pen!"
5,Works great!,"I started using this right away. It's easy to use, the instructions are right on the back. 1) Brush away any particles with the brush. 2) Wipe the lens with the lens cleaning tip in circular motions.I could see the smudges being wiped away as I cleaned and the resulting lens is completely clean and without any smudges! I have no idea how I ever could have lived without this lens pen! It's inexpensive and a must for anyone with cameras or binoculars. A total 5 stars!"
3,"It works, but seems to smear easily","It's conveniently in a pen shape, which is cool. But I noticed that it smears easily when using on eyeglasses. I may just be heavy handed, but just fyi, ya gotta be tactful with it!"
5,Great Gadget,"No more lens tissue and lens cleaner. This gadget really works! I have 3 of them, use them all the time."
4,Good device,I was looking for a device for cleaning my DSLR camera lenses and I found this one. I think LensPEN is a good cleaning device for this purpose.
5,!This is the real one,"I first discovered this pen from a friend and quickly looked it up. I then shopped very carefully for this product knowing that there are knock off pens out there. This particular product is the correct LensPEN and if you check their website you can see what they include to ensure a genuine LensPEN (I highly suggest you do this after getting your pen). It is also reassuring that by ordering this from Amazon, if I did get the wrong product I could easily return it. I love this pen, it's endorsed by Nikon, and it's super easy to use. I simply blow the lens, then shake/tap out the brush, brush the lens then use the cleaning tip. My lenses have never been so clean!"
4,Handy little thing!,Instructions on the package are easy to understand and represent the product accurately. Easy to carry with you and very durable. Works great on the lenses and filters! Have not had it too long so not sure how long it will last but so for the price I paid this is a great tool to have in my bag so far.
3,"Great product, but not for compact cameras","LensPen works perfectly, but be assure than this is what you need. If you're a compact camera user you will need a smaller size"
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"Carefully followed instructions and tried the product on a camera lens, phone touchscreen, and glasses. On all surfaces it smeared marks and oils instead of removing them. Useless."
1,be careful about duplicate Lenspen,"I order a Lenspen lens cleaning system by ""LensPEN"" from Amazon marketplace(HDE). I received the item and tried it on my lens, believe me my lens looks very bad after using it. I think I got an duplicate product because nowhere it says the manufacturer as ""LensPEN"". Be careful in choosing the seller."
1,This is NOT the authentic Lenspen!!!,"This is NOT an authentic Lenspen cleaning pen. I should have known better by looking at the product picture as it is obviously NOT an authentic Lenspen package. Serves me right for staying up late at nite to put together my wish-list. :p What's even more ironic, is that the device itself doesn't even have its own logo on the clip as shown in the package picture! It's a knock-off of a knock-off? LOLI may change my rating after testing it out on an old pair of eyeglass lenses or something like that. We'll see."
1,Avoid this product at all costs,"I purchased this after misplacing my Nikon branded lens pen. I expected this to be the same. I was dead wrong.The LensPEN I received had absolutely no cleaning solution (the black powder) on it at all. Unfortunately I only realized this after attempting to clean my lens with it. Now all I have is circular smudges all over my lens (worse than when I started) and nothing to clean them with.In short, either this product is a fraud, or their quality control is so bad that they'd sell a cleaning product without the cleaning solution. Do not buy!"
2,Some explain to me how to keep the cap on these things???,I have bought about 3 of these and every time within days the cap starts falling off.. It simply wont stay on! At first it's pretty tight but very shortly it's as if the cap weakens or something.... Once that happens it's basically useless...
4,"Good, but not perfect","I tried my new lenspen on a Nikon NC filter. I noticed two small spots that could not be removed, even when the lenspen was used on both sides. I assumed that it was defect in the filter. Nope. Using a lens cleaning solution (sold by Edmunds Scientific for telescope lenses), the spots came off readily. So, this will be a handy tool to carry around, but it can't remove ALL spots. Perhaps I should have tried breathing on the filter and then using the lenspen...too late for that."
4,Great for a quick fix!,"This is a great product for a quick lens clean. It's small and lightweight so it's perfect for small camera bags. It's even small enough to keep in your shirt pocket. I like how the brush retracts into the pen to keep from fraying or damage. The opposite end is used for rubbing smudges off which is great but it seems to fall apart. Little bits of it keep peeling off around the edges. Other than that, I love it!!"
4,Great!,This lens cleaner pen is compact and does what it's supposed to do. I am glad I made this purchase.
4,Must have if you have a Camera,Since long I was looking for some magic cleaner and this lens Pen is the Perfect solution. It works as advertised
4,Great for quickly taking care of smudges.,"It's a great, small tool to keep in your camera bag. It makes quick work of accidental fingerprints on the lens without additional streaks or smudges. This, with a rocket blowerGiottos AA1900 Rocket Air Blaster Large - Blackand a microfiber cloth, should take care of your basic cleaning needs."
4,Good,I wish the bristles were a little bit more softer. At 10 bucks this len pen feels a little pricier for what it feels like in my hand. I would give 7 bucks!
5,Quick and painless,"This item does exactly what it claims and is very easy to use, not to mention very affordable. Get one!"
5,Great Item!,"Even with your lenses, take care of this item too. It does no good if you have a filthy, unkept brush now scratching and smearing instead of cleaning and maintaining your hard-earned lenses.In any case, nice design and fits well in your camera bag for easy accessibility. No complaints here so far and cleaning my lenses very well as it should!"
3,It cleans the lens very good but the brush is averager IMO,"It works great in my Rebel XT, Panasonic and Camcorder! So: worth it but it's not exceptional or a five-star category!"
3,It works ... kind of .,"It would all depend on what you are trying to clean. It's good for cleaning dust and such, but not really good on stains or anything of that sort."
1,Get something else,"This pens DOES NOT clean the lens at all. The cleaning solution that was supposed to be in the cap does not seem to be there. After battling with it to clean my lens for quiet a while, I was left with debris and circular smudges all over the lens. I wish I have known better. Oh well."
1,WORSE ITEM YOU CANNOT BUY,We purcahsed these at the recommendation of a camera person at a photography store. IT RUINED the lenses scratching them and we had to buy a whole new camera. DON'T RISK IT!!!
1,waste of money,Useless. A q tip does a better job. Left some smears that's about it. Got a q-tip and cleaned it off.
2,Bad Quality Control Lately,"I've been using LensPen for a long time, and always stay away from knock offs. However, lately I noticed a very serious quality assurance problem and the felt tip from the lens pen felt off as I swiped my lens (filter on, fortunately) in circular motion, and leaving smudges because of the cheap glue it used kept rubbing onto my expensive Hoya HD filter.... That filter is now semi-ruined, but fortunately it's not my lens got ruined.... I wonder if they tried to lower cost of production by outsourced it to some cheap manufacturing plant oversea.... I think I'll go back using microfibre cloth with Zeiss lens cleaning solution, though not as convenient as LensPen, but I won't risk my lens being ruined."
5,Best lens cleaning device,The pen works perfectly! Excellent construction and price. It leaves the lenses super clean. I recommend it 100%. Cleaning brush and the lens cleaning excellent size to do the job.
1,Makes lens dirty,"I don't know if it's a fake but it makes lens dirty!!! Even my hands are black after I touched the pad of this pen. Be careful! If you bought it, try it somewhere else first, don't make this cheap thing to hurt your camera.I still don't understand why this ""cleaning"" pad has effect like black marker!!!"
1,Beware of Lenspen!,"Feel free to use this product as a brush for your lens, but the other side of the Lenspen took the coating off of a full set of Arri MasterPrimes on a set where my friend was ACing. Thousands of dollars to repair. Stick to regular lens cleaning tissue."
2,Not what you expected.,"I got this unit and tried using it to clean my lens, using the brush end added grease to my lens. After reading reviews, one of them said that it maybe a counter fit. The other side seems to work fine. I saw a piece of lint in the viewfinder so I tried using the brush to brush it away. When I looked through, not only did it get worse because the brush fibers fell off, now it left a greasy smear on the view finder. I called Canon about my T3i, and it has to be sent in for repair. After reading more about how to clean the view finder, it was safer to send it to the service center to have it done professionally. It is just sad that I will be without my camera for the duration of the repair.Don't make the same mistake I do. If you are going to use it, use it only for the front of the lens. Where at least you can clean the greasy residue off."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"It works as advertized, but may be a little hyped.Joh 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
3,Do these things really work?,"I bought a set of two. It worked ok on my newer lenses (film SLRs - Mamiya, and Fijinon), but then again they were not that dirty. I buy a lot of vintage cameras and I was hoping I can use the lenses for those as well. Not sure if it's because of the lack of coating or fewer layers on some but I don't believe the lenspens made any difference whatsoever. The brush is nice but the felt actually leaves some rubbery residue behind...I will probably stick with the cloth and liquid - at least when it comes down to the older lenses..."
5,"Unfortunately, I have four of these....","and usually I only know where 2 of them are. I'm a professional photographer in Tucson and I do a lot of events and location photography. This pen can be and has been a life saver for me on a number of occasions. I do notice that, over time, the cleaning end (as opposed to the brush end) will start to dry a bit and leave trails. But, even with that, it's a much better solution than pulling out a lens cloth or lens paper."
5,Very Handy,"This convenient and totally effective little pen is great. As the description states, you can wipe down the lens with pretty good accuracy using the pad under the cap, and the brush pops out of the other end for dust removal.Very portable and convenient form factor, very effective, totally worth every penny!"
4,Good one,Very good one. Suggested by me for all. This is a must have. And very cheap. Value for money. The brush id fine but the best part is the carbon lid.
2,Maybe a fluke?,"I received this pen, smashed in it's packaging. I think instead of ordering something small like this online I should have just went to my neighborhood camera store. I hang out there too much as it is though."
5,"Great price, works as described","I was worried this was going to scratch my lens, but so far it has performed well. Its light and easy to pack."
3,lenspen,"This is a good product, but not exactly what I had in mind. I thought it would be the only cleaning tool I'd need."
2,Only OK for me,"I really expected to like this pen ... but I really didn't. It didn't get into the edges of the lens as well as a lens cleaning cloth would have. I didn't find the brush particularly useful, either. I suppose in a pinch it would be better than nothing."
5,Saved my ability to take pics on the beaces in Mexico!,"What an incredible, inexpensive little tool. My lens got all fogged up from condensation on a private beach on the coast of Cozumel. This little guy got it all cleaned up and ready to go after a failed attempt to wipe it clean with a lens cloth. For the ~ $7 I paid for it, it was well worth it and I will never be without one of these again."
3,"Sinatra's most requested songs, except for...","New York New York, Strangers In The Night, Fly Me To The Moon, The Lady Is A Tramp, Night And Day, Come Fly With Me, Witchcraft, I've Got You Under My Skin, etc. etc. etc. This collection is taken from the first few years of Frank's career and it doesn't represent the Sinatra that most people know and (hopefully) love. These ""16 Most Requested Songs"" collections never contain the most requested songs but rather ancient tunes from the vaults and they are generally a rip off. Beware.Ok if you like early Frank and know what you're getting into. Otherwise check out ""The Very Good Years"" from Reprise Records."
3,I can't say I'm that impressed,"I know these songs were recorded in his early career when he was about 30. Nice voice (even though I feel there is not much youthful energy in there, he sounded like at least above 40), he really set the romantic mood singing these songs, but there is not much range in his vocal and songs. There is the same feel through the whole cd."
4,Cute,"The picture makes the products in the basket look like they take up most of the basket, but - I'll admit that the basket it came in is different than the picture - there's more stuffing than product."
3,"Bottom barrel bit, but I like it, ....so far, still on the honeymoon,","Just wanted something to record singing practice, it overmodulates easily, but on the otherhand it makes great spyware. You can leave it recording with the endcap off & everyone thinks it's just a flashdrive ~ fool your friends ~ yuk, hyuk.I say that because it won't shut off after 3 minutes like the manual says. There are other quirky behaviors and I'm glad I bought the extended warrany 'cause it will probably go back, but for now, I'm still interested in this strange little beasty."
4,An interesting perspective on the origins of civilization,I'd suggest this book to anyone who is reading recent books on the origins of civilization. What I liked about it is that Diop was bringing a wealth of research that was otherwise inaccessible to me to the this issue--and I found that I could connect this history to that of Europe and Britain using other resources that I have. the issue I have with is is that some of the work struck me as oriented to handling one set of politically motivated forms of anthropology that he found objectionable-but he didn't consider the work of a lot of other major authors (i.e. the work of Lewis Spence on connections between North Africa and Ancient Britain). I thought Diops criticisms of Gimubutus were especially interesting.
1,A sad racist polemic,"There's a great deal to be said for disrupting the Eurocentrism of historians and other scholars but Diop goes overboard into racist harangues. If Diop were trying to expose Euro centric scholars by imitating and exagerrating their errors with a black outlook rather than a white outlook I could possibly excuse him, but he is so blinded by his race that he loses all pretense of objectivity or scholarship."
1,what a load,"i found many of the ""facts"" asserted in this book to be hillarious. diop's opinion that the hittites were egyptian vassals shows his ignorance of history. so does his belief that iron spread through the mediteranean from napata. the egyptians never managed to achieve more than an equality with the hittites, and were defeated by them repeatedly. rameses barely got out of kadesh alive, and the dorians introduced iron to greece. the hittites introduced it to the fertile crescent. diop showcases his ignorance in this book. by it for a good laugh."
1,Sheer Nonsense,"Diop has published a series of laughable books that can best be described as the sheerest nonsense writ large. As for the doofus who seems to think that reality can only be discerned depending on race, see the prominent African-American scholar Clarence Walker's WE CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN for a destruction of the afro-centric fraud.What puzzles me is how the spread of obvious lies and distortions is supposed to help a people's self-esteem (the usual explanation among scholars for sidestepping real criticism of afro-centric ""scholarship""). There have been truly impressive and great African civilizations that existed in reality, not simply in the twisted pseudo-scholarship of Diop and his cohorts. See Robert Edgerton's THE FALL OF THE ASANTE EMPIRE, for a description of one such advanced society in Africa."
1,What a joke,"Ah, the jealous create their own worlds in order to comfort themselves.Even if the ancient Greeks started by copying basic culture from the Middle East and Africa, they then expanded on it to create their own wonderful civilization. Did the blacks create philosophy, drama, or organized warfare? How do the sculptures of the Greeks compare to those of Africa? Are the Iliad and the Odyssey really African tales? Was Aristotle trully black? Did Plato sail down to Africa, copy ideas for his debates, and sail back to orate at the Acropolis? Did the phalanx come from Egypt?Please people,how about a reality check? This book constitutes pure drivel. While different perspectives are always welcome, let them be based on fact, not someone's FANTASY. The way this book was embraced in a few quarters really demonstrates people's inability to think for themselves."
4,An Interconnected History,This is essential reading for anyone seeking a non-Western interpretation of history and the world. It describes African history as well as anything ever written.
2,"STILL WAITING FOR THE ""GOOD STUFF""","Booooor----ing! Singers just didn't do it for me -- I saw the NYCO give it a few years ago and, 'twas Wonderful!!!! Mme. Erroney & others were not up to the task -- sorry, fell short - way, way short - give it a try - until a REAL CD or DVD comes your/our way!"
3,"Like Watching Only 10 Of The ""Thirteen Days Of Glory""","(Five stars for ""The Magnificent Seven and one star for the edited ""Alamo"" averages out to three stars, for the combination)Two great Western movies here, but when, OH WHEN, is the entire, unedited, theatrical release of ""the Alamo"" going to be released on DVD? I have the two tape set on VHS, so I know that it does exist (though I've heard that there was actually an even longer edition at one time, now supposedly lost forever). In a time when ""Director's Cuts,"" ""Unedited/Extended Versions,"" and ""Unrated Versions"" are available for everything from ""Avatar"" to the ""X Men,"" why can't we get the extended version of John Wayne's labor of love, ""The Alamo?"""
2,not so happy,"because I ordered thru amazon, overton could not help with a problem. One of the tires had a slow leak and the only recourse was to return the entire product. It didn't seem feasible to do so, thus, we had to buy a new replacement tire."
2,Too advanced for beginner,"I am just beginning to work with wood and found these ideas just a little too intimidating.....probably a great book for someone that knows what they are doing, but not for the person who might not have a router!"
4,Vivid and Irresistible,"I had no problem with the use of ""Asian-like"" elements in this story. It was a distinct flavor throughout the story, but the empire of Wa is its own place. At the start I was a bit discouraged by the focus on the court intrigues and soap-opera elements of the story, but these elements, combined with the extraordinarily vivid imagery and consistently mounting tension, proved to be irresistible for me. As I have heard others say, my only real complaint is that I finished the book long after the bookstores have all closed and I absolutely MUST get to the sequel ""Gatherer of Clouds"" as soon as possible! A wonderful tale of adventure and drama!"
5,Right up there with Dune,"This book and the sequel that follows it are two of the best fantasy books I've ever read. The author succeeds in inventing an entire world, along with its art, poetry, mythology and culture.It's right up there with Dune---not just science fiction, real literature. Better yet, the story is unforgettable and the suspense builds right up to the last page of the second book...which ends with a surprising twist."
4,A must read if you are in to feudal asian history.,Even though this book is fiction the underlying feudalism is still apparent. Great book and the characters are introduced in such a way that is not overwhelming. I can hardly wait to read the second part.
4,fairly usefull tool,"It does what its supposed to do. If you drive L-shaped nails when installing hardwood flooring, and the nail doesnt drive all the way in, this is the tool to use. Better than a typical nail set. Has a wider tip for the wider nail head. Good product, worth the extra few bucks."
2,Don't waste the $,Spend a tenth of the price and get a regular nail set. This one slips off the cleat way too easily.
1,Another chunk of steel for the scrap pile,"This tool is a big, heavy piece of high quality tool steel. It's easy to hold and smack with a hammer. Now, what is it good for? It sure isn't setting flooring cleats. The head is too tiny and way too smooth - I gave it a good G.D. try on dozens of slightly high cleat heads only to have it slip off every time. I tried roughing up the face with a diamond file - no help at all. I went back to my tried and true oversize nail punch and tossed this one into the back of the tool drawer. I guess it's good for punching a lower case sans serif L into wood. Save your money - this is not the tool you are looking for. Move along."
3,It was just OK,"For the most part I preferred to use this setter rather than my other nail sets for the L-Nail, but I do think that it could have been designed much better to prevent it from slipping off the nail head."
4,"Very nice tool, but expensive","This tool is beautifully made and works well. You certainly get what you pay for, but ~$15 for a nail set is a high price.Still, if you inadvertently leave a nail slightly raised while face nailing with the Porta-Nailer in face-nailing mode, this tool really saves the day.If you only use your Porta-Nailer to blind nail, then I'd probably use a standard nail punch, as any slips/damage to the tongue of the plank while setting a raised nail will be hidden by the next plank."
3,Not as easy as it looks...,"Better than using a standard nail set, but Porta-Nail nails can be problematic to set. Your best bet is to take your time with the Porta-Nailer to get the nail set properly the first time. Hint: Do not let the nailer move at all until the nail is set and the ratcheting ram has reset. A little pricey for a nail set."
2,Flooring Nail Setting Tool,"I'm using cleat flooring nails and found this tool completely worthless for setting them into hard maple. The tip is basically equivalent to a slot screwdriver, so it slipped right off of the nail head when aligned. I found a standard medium head nailset simpler and more effective."
2,Not sized well for the L-nails,"The setting tool is sturdy, but the tip is too small and has no ""catch"" to help it seat onto the nails. Something a little larger or with an alignment ridge would have been better for my purposes. If you already have a decently sized nailset, this one offers little additional advantage. Otherwise, it's plenty well made and held up to use just fine."
3,Not worth the price,"I found it difficult to keep the blade of the setting tool on the head of a cleat -- both are very narrow, so the tool slips off easily when using it to set an errant cleat. Frankly, in putting in about 3000 cleats with the PortaNailer, I had only two unset cleats that required using this tool. For that little use, I might as well have used a screw-driver as a setting tool. The PortaNailer does such a good job of punching the cleats below the surface of the tongues that I think you'll find little use for this setting tool"
2,not so hot,"This flooring nail setting tool was admittedly handy, but it was actually unnecessary for setting the flooring cleats we used. In fact, we used a regular nail set quite often in our project when the cutter had the fancy tool and all the nailer had was a finish nail nail set. If money is no object, by all means, buy one. If you're doing a small project or want to do it on the cheap (my usual mode), then just use your nail set!"
5,What it is!,"Just another nail-set, but with a design specific end for the Porta-Nail nails. For the few bucks it cost it makes me feel better knowing I am going to be using the proper tool for the job."
2,expensive,This was designed to fit the nail head but often slips and damages the floor. I ended up using my finishing nail setting tool instead and surprisingly that worked better. The finishing nail setting tool has tiny round tip with groove instead of this flat screw driver looking tip. That groove helped to prevent slipping when I apply with a hammer. I initially thought the round tip could ruin the nail head or puncture or leave round impression on the hardwood material but this wasn't the case. I paid three dollars for the set of finishing nail setting tools (3 total in different size) at local store.
2,Don't need it,"The staple gun I bought (the Bynford) worked so well, I did not need this tool. I have an old screwdriver that works just as well."
2,Slides off nail head in use.,Rectangle shaped tip slides off nail head in use. Easy to misalign and bend nail.I found regular finishing nail punch applied in nails vertical line worked better.This one needs ridges on outside edge of long tip to keep punch on nail head.
2,"Nice tool, but doesn't work all that well","This is a quality made tool, but it isn't that effective in setting 1/4"" crown staples in hardwood flooring. All I manage to do with it is bend the staple head and break the tounge in the floorboard.There just simply isn't enough support for the staple to drive it into the board without deforming / bending."
2,way over priced,"if you buy one of those cheap guns you will for sure need something like this. but save yourself some money, go to Lowes or one of those stores and buy a 3/8 or 1/2"" cold chisel and then just grind a flat edge on it, you can get one for under $5"
2,Poor recommendation,Purchased a Bostitich stapler. This was recommended as part of the purchase. Turns out you can't use this product with the staples that go in the stapler.
1,Porta-Nail 42620,This was recommended on the site but was not the correct size for the staples on the Ramsond rmm4 2-1 Air Hardwood stapler Gun. In this case the Local big box dealer was 10.00 cheaper. On a 14.00 dollar item that is a heck of a mark up!
3,Back ordered,looks like it will work of. It was on back order and had first job done for three weeks before it finally showed up
3,Flooring Nail,"Okay, a mail is a nail how much more can I say about a nail, it does the job every-time."
2,Not worth the money,"This tool to set the staples is not useful, slips off the staple. I ended up using a standard nail set when I had a staple not set correctly."
1,Items missing,I did not receive my items as the box they were in was empty. I did email regarding this situation and FedEx filed a claim but have not heard anything regarding this situation.
1,Waste of money,"As some of the other reviewers have said that this punch is a waste of money. Maybe it would be good if using it on softer flooring like oak. I had to make one that would work on Strand Bamboo by taking a round punch cutting a slot in the end and then thinning it down to fit into the tongue, this worked."
1,Nail and Staple setting Tool,Waste of money. Any DIY planning to do a flooring job spend the money on something more useful.If you take care in setting the pressure on your porta nailer you will not need to use the setting tool.
2,Too small for flooring staples,The picture looks good but the rectangular head is way too small for flooring staples. Probably works OK with flooring nails but not staples. Save your money and gring off the end of a chisel or just use a cup point nail punch.
2,Not worth buying,I purchased this setting tool as I thought it would be worth it for the flooring nails that didn't get set. I had a few that needed to be driven in but this tool was not worth the money. The nails bent under the narrow point. A small bolt worked way better and didn't cost twenty bucks. Save your money and use a bolt.
3,Steve sings and the band plays the songs,"I'm a fan of the early Steve Earle, which this disk certainly is, but I played it once and will sell it. I see it as a mostly uninspired set where the band plays and Steve sings, both without much inspiration. There is just nothing exciting about it and the performance just about totally lacks spontaneity. They had a set list and they played it as they had rehearsed it with lots of competence but no inspiration that was evident to me. I was really disappointed as I bought it after reading the otherwise excellent reviews. I suggest renting it first; maybe you'll agree with the other reviewers but maybe not."
4,takes a couple listens....,"before the tracks really start to stand out from each other...but they do. A good CD overall, a bit of an industrial feel to it, surprisingly."
3,Cheap but fun,These are a little cheap - pepper falls off the light until you get them set - but fun. Also product said Indoor Use Only when received.
4,Chili Pepper Lights,The Chili Pepper lights were received in a timely manner. They were in the condition expected for the price paid. We are happy with our lights to put up underneath our deck.
1,broke too early,"My daughter used this for 1-2 years before the volume dropped to nil. the CD's can barely be heard. This device should have lasted many years (5+?) before failing. Don't waste your money, even if it's $5.BTW, it seems that many of the cheap CD playing products fail prematurely. either the CD lens gets dirty or the player quits working. What happened to reliable children's toys?!?!I'm looking for a repair manual or a schematic diagram online without any luck.Memorex should stick with making Cd's and tapes..."
1,SCOSCHE KA2065B it doesn't fit the KIA SPORTAGE!!!!!!,FYI: SCOSCHE KA2065B it doesn't fit the KIA SPORTAGE!!!!!! THERE WILL BE A BIG GAP BETWEEN THE DASH AND THE KIT I called SCOSCHE Tech help and they are a joke!!! they are aware of the gap and still claim it fits that model ...lol will not buy SCOSCHE products again
1,They need to check their records,This does not fit a 2002 Kia Optima. It is not even listed on the bag but the site claims it is the correct one!
4,Dictionary please,"Since ""Elbert's Bad Word"" is probably mostly for the first and second grade kids, there needs to be some discussion of certain words in the book BEFORE the reading of the book begins. For example, ask the kids what a ""BOA"" is and tell them what it is. And, ask them what a ""Butler"" is, and tell them what it is. And, ask them what a ""Garden Party"" is and tell them what it is. Ask the what Croquet is and tell them what it is. And, ask them what a ""Gnat"" is, an tell them, etc."
5,"Unique, visual approach to teaching kids how to express anger!","Stumbled across this book in a discount sale and what a fantastic find! A unique approach to helping children understand how to deal with the existence of ""bad words"" and how to find alternate ways to express their feelings. Takes a visual approach by making the ""bad word"" a snickering little cloud that shrinks away when the boy learns how to express frustration in words without using the bad words he's heard. The only potential downside is that the little boy in the story is clearly from a wealthy family and the story mostly takes place at a ritzy party which some children may not identify with (particularly some of the vocabulary) - however, even if kids don't identify with Elbert's lifestyle they will certainly identify with his dilemma. Highly recommended!"
5,Elbert's Bad Word,"One of the greatest children's books of all time. The Woods have written and illustrated other books including The Napping House which is also a favorite of ours, but Elbert's Bad Word is our all-time favorite. The book deals with bad words in a creative and fun way. The story is wonderful and the illustrations are perfect. Your kids will love this book and you will enjoy reading it again and again with them."
5,great for the 3-6 year old set,"this is my 3 and 5 year olds' favorite car tape, especially the songs Family Tree, and Plenty of Room."
5,a must-have for families with young children,"Wonderful children's music that adults like, too. ""Someone's Gonna Use It"" and ""Family Tree"" are my favorites. We also have ""In My Hometown,"" but ""Family Tree"" is a better CD, in my opinion."
5,Highly recommended!,"I highly recommend ALL of Tom Chapin's children's music! I'm always amazed more people haven't heard of him. All his songs are catchy, witty, imaginative, creative and just plain fun. Some are sweet, thoughtful and even manage to educate a bit about the world and the ways to be in it. We did the Raffi route way back, and my 3+ and 6 year old love Chapin's music SO much better -- SO DO I! Their teachers love it when they bring them for show-and-tell, we use them at informal UU church services, everyone we play them for loves them and wonders why they haven't heard of this great music before. The great thing is we'll still be listening to these CDs 5 years from now... maybe even more! They are our own classics and we'll never part with them. Check Tom's own website and find out if he's playing near you -- he's terrific to see in person. Can't say enough good things about all his kid CDs -- BUY THEM, BUY THEM ALL!"
3,Not Bad. Could be Better,This CD is not bad. Our children never want to listen to it.Try something by Raffi or Cedarmount Kids.
3,"The birth of an ""angry young man""","This is Lodge's second book and it's far different from his later work. It's the story of the National Service experiences (in the mid-1950s) of Jonathan Browne, narrated by himself: His introduction to Basic Training, the friends and enemies he makes, the appalling stupidity and mental waste of the army, his final acceptance of it, and his marginal success through the two years until he's mustered out. It's also the story of Michael Brady, a casual friend from college who becomes Jonathan's near obsession, an Irish Catholic whose personal morality will not permit him to bend to the will of the army he so loathes. While this is not in any way a major work, it certainly shows an early promise that Lodge subsequently developed brilliantly."
5,Exactly as i orded,This was exactly as i remembered. i had one before and it was lost in the move and now i have it again.
5,Another great book from Isobelle Carmody,"In this book the characters have really developed into adults. There are many relationships formed bewteen characters which were not there in the first two books. It explores the dreamtrails and you learn more about the past. The rebellion also occours, with mixed results but Elspeth is more focosed on her quest. In this book there are many interesting suprises, such as finding out that Ariel is the destroyer, finding a statue carved by someone from the past looks exactly like Elspeth and Rushton's kidnapping. I am waiting in suspense for the fifth book (The Sending)to be released, which should be very soon."
4,A Review for the Keeping Place,"This book is harder to get into than the previous three in the series. There isn't as much action so it can be hard to stay focased when reading it but there are a few events that take place which leave you tingling like you get after another clue has been revealed in a big mystery. Overall I think it was worth all the money it cost to buy it from Australia but I wouldn't say it was as good as the previous three. It could drag on sometimes and, like I said, it sometimes it was hard to stay with it and focas on what you were reading."
1,Perhaps the worst computer book I have ever read,"This book is bad on so many levels, it's hard to know where to begin. The typesetter was clearly drunk, as evidenced by the unreadable spacing and inconsistent typefaces used in the code samples. The code samples themselves were often either useless, or just flat-out wrong. The Java code was not only completely extraneous, it was hideously bad, throwing out any semblance of style or normal coding conventions. The XML grammar itself was presented in difficult-to-read snippets of BNF notation, which is an incredibly irritating way to try to learn new concepts. I think the author must have been cutting and pasting from the w3c spec.It doesn't even seem worth pointing out that much of the information in the book is long out of date.Just unspeakably wretched. Buy any other XML book, or buy none. You'd be better off."
1,BAD,What was the author thinking i mean the book just talks about java infact one whole chapter i brought the book to learn XML and it doesn't teach you that it teaches you more java then XML.
1,As clear as Mud!!,"What I've learned about XML thus far has come from Internet websites. So I wanted a 'Complete' book on XML to show 'this is what it is, and this is how it is done'. After the first few chapters of this book, I am now thoroughly confused - COMPLETE(LY)!"
1,"poorly explained, with no real help when things go wrong","i bought this book to help me develop xml skills for use on client sites.I found the book informative and useful ..until page 65..?after which, when things started to go wrong there was no way to find help, the code did not work and no help was offered, the cd just mirrored the code and that did not work either.Am still trying to pick up xml looking for a new reference."
3,"Good idea, lukewarm delivery.","I wanted to learn to use the MSXML parser and this book helped. A lot. I would encourage the author to repeat the style (namely to explain how free tools work). And I would encourage him to use a little less paper (don't repeat all the code). And, I would encourage him to post code fixes on a web site. If he did all that, it would be a clear winner in my estimation."
1,Disappointed,"As stated in the other reviews - the examples, (starting as early as chapter 2) are outdated and will not even compile since it uses a version of msxml that has been superseded by msxml 1.8. If you are into leveraging code samples to get a better understanding programming books, than I'd have to say stay away from this one. On the bright side, it would probably double as a good firelog if if you already bought it."
3,Learn-by programming approach has some flaws,"This book is more than 500 pages long, but most of it is lines of Java code. The intention is that (without needing to understand Java) you will be able to write programs and see how XML works. It's a good strategy, but unfortunately, there are some flaws. It is built around Microsoft's XML parser, which has changed since the book was written. Thus, the code won't work right if you type it verbatim from the book. There are also a few typos, but nothing too major."
2,"Complicated, but the stuff kinda works",I have had trouble with the cd-rom. These files do not work in my parser. There are no solutions in the book. It needs troubleshooting section.
1,"The name for this book IS ""Microsoft XML parser for Dummies""","What is the connection between ""XML complete"" and ""Our First Java Application: helloapp"". The book's size could be 100 pages instead of 500 having all the junk droped."
2,Nope. I didn't like it either,"I bought it because as an intranet application designer I wanted to see what XML could bring to my applications. I hoped that XML Complete would share some valuable knowledge, but all I got was some pretty badly written Java which doesn't compile under Microsoft's current SDK. I found fixing the sample code to be instructive, though."
2,Code Errors encountered during the beginning of the book,Any updated version of source code can be found on-line? Then the book will be more useful. You can learn more when you debug the code.
1,Pretty bad. Needs major revisions.,"Despite the proliferation of computer books out there, quality books written for computer professionals are amazingly hard to come by. I have gotten to selecting books by publisher now, and after reading this one, McGraw-Hill has dropped to the bottom of my favorite list. The book is poorly organized, each example is repeated 10 times. It's hard to read, presents too little information for the number of pages it is. The book reads like something that was typed up in a haste to get to the market with very little concern for quality."
4,4 1\2 stars- It is a great book!,"The ONLY reason I gave it 4.5 instead of 5, is because the other 4 fairy books are better in my opinion.This is still a great read, just seems to lack some character depth, and has a little less ""fairy magic"" then the first 4 books."
2,Unsatisfying story thread,"This book was not as good as the other we have read, Vidia and the Fairy Crown. The hero who leaves home should encounter challenges, overcome them, and return transformed. None of that here. Rani runs away because she feels sorry for herself. There is not a quest or a goal she must accomplish. She basically wanders around. The mermaids she meets are beautiful, shallow jerks but that was lost on my 4 year old. Ultimately Rani returns home because Tinkerbell tracks her down. She accomplishes little.I am not sure whether to get another of these fairy books. I like Fairy Crown because it made sense and there was a takeaway message. If the message in Mermaid Lagoon is that one should appreciate people for what they are, not how they look, it is too subtle - partly because although the mermaids are drawn beautifully, Rani herself is no slouch.Plus we were really hoping for a Tusked Nevershark to show up, but no luck."
5,One of my favorites out of the series,"I think we have all had our own times where felt left out or just plain useless. Rani goes on an adventure to find where she fits into the world of the faeries. She wants to feel she can make a difference in Pixie Hollow, but, because she is different from the others, now they only see her differences. In some ways they see her as incapable of using her talent as she always has. Rain comes to understand that her talent is just fine, and she learns to be creative along the way. So on the outside she maybe different from the other faeries, but on the inside she is a stronger faerie."
4,My daughter loves this book!,I love to see my daughter want to read instead of watch TV or play video games. NO other book has peaked her interest like this one. She now loves Tinker Bell and all her nice friends. She loved this book so much that she asked for other books in the series. I plan on purchasing the whole series for her for Christmas.
3,Still doesn't replace an audio mixer,"It records in nearly acceptable quality. It looks like an out board audio mixer is still the only way to get a desirable quality in sound recording. It also took a good bit of trial and error to get the thing to behave, I ended up running it off an amp rather than directly from the instrument to the USB. It's not the simple plug and play that I'd really hoped for."
1,$140 Xerox book,"I expect to pay 130-150 dollars for updated school books. However, paying that much for a paperback book that looks like it was put together by a high schooler with a bad copier is just a rip off. Although much of the content so far is sound, 6 yrs is arguably out-of-date in today's corporate climate on the subject. Since this is a mandatory book for my class, I will definitely recommend another book on the subject."
3,too much great music for 1 CD,"If you are going to start with a single CD Mingus compilation to start off your collection or do some exploring, I would suggest the new 'definative' collection released in conjunction with the Ken Burns JAZZ documentary on PBS.Of course, the music on this CD is incredible. That is not the question. Personally, I suggest the 13 Chapters Anthology on Rhino, which is comes close to representing the ecclectic genius of this Great American Composer and band leader."
5,To help in challenging times,"This simple to learn yet profound meditation practice is brilliantly presented in Peace Practice CD. Sat Hon explains its roots in a profound introduction. He then gives poetic and lucid instruction on the techniques of the practice. I got a good insight into the vastness of the meditation listening to the group discussion of both newcomers and practioners sharing the expanse of their experiences. The dialog with Master Hon on suggestions for beginners was very helpful being new to this type of meditation. I loved the evocative music woven throughout the CD which helped me feel and understand the practice as much as the technical instruction.Thank you Master Hon for sharing this ray of light, a life line to hold onto during these very dark times."
5,Interesting Information!,This book is filled with fascinating facts about our attempts to stop terrorism. I would like to thank the wonderful people that we read about in this book for making our country a safer place!
2,Not up to my expectations,"I really liked the first Hellsing, so when I heard about the remake I was thrilled! But this volume doesn't show any expansion on the original series, and really just felt like a waste of time. The bonus book of scenes from the storyboard is thick, but I was hoping for some more of the rough sketches.Kind of a disappointment all around. But I would recommend the original Hellsing series for anybody who likes vampire movies or anime."
2,WTF,"why in the world is the asking price ($49.99) higher then the listing price($24.98), and who is going to pay that when the listing is lower?"
3,Not really worth the cash,"Though I love Hellsing I found that the Limited Edition of OVA 2 is not really worth the money. The extra DVD is probably the stupidest thing ever, its just the main guy from the English voice team or whatever and than the people who do the voices of Jan and Luke. They just laugh the whole time about nothing and its extremely boring. It made me lose respect for them. The art book is great though, its something a true Hellsing fan would appreciate. So OVA 2 is great, but I would suggest getting the regular edition. Unless your a diehard fan."
5,Still in love,"Loved the first one, and love this one as well. It's getting better and the story is unfolding nicely.Better animated than the series, it sticks more to the manga and is more perverse, bloody, and entertaining as well."
4,Great for the not-so-great golfer,"I'm no Tiger Woods, but this club really helps getting up and over the trees in the forest i keep hitting in to!!"
3,Mostly so-so,"""To Serve Man"" is a favorite of mine, though it is kind of funny to see Richard Kiel in costume with the big head - and he never speaks.""Third From the Sun"" has a neat twist, but is otherwise not special. I like Fritz Weaver in almost everything, especially the movie ""Fail Safe"".""The Shelter"" is a formulaic plot that seems well-used. This was probably much better when it was first shown, because of the political time-frame.""The Fugitive"" is pretty light and a little fluffy for my taste, almost like Disney wrote it.I think there are better collections. I like #7."
4,Design Tech Monitor 33370,"Am real happy with the unit, but I must say it's set up under ideal conditions. The receiver is on a window sill and has a direct line of sight to the sensor which is right at 100 feet away. Our driveway is fairly wide and the sensor sometimes did not detect our smaller car, changing the unit to high sensitivity cured this. Haven't taken the time to set the receiver down on an end table so it has to detect the sensor signal through our metal sided house wall to see how that goes. As stated, the way it's performed so far is great, especially since not too long ago various monitors were way over $150. I expect it to work intermittently when the weather gets extremely cold, but that's not the units fault, alkaline batteries quit working while they're super-cold, however the sensor sounded this AM when it was 12 above."
2,worked for about 6 months,"After many trial and error with placement. We finally seemed to get it in a spot where it went off every time, every vehicle. Now, the receiver has stopped working, won't even go off when transmitter and receiver are in the same room. Can't replace just the receiver, so we're looking for totally new monitor. Will probably go with different brand this time."
3,Better than nothing but...,"This unit is confusing. It ignores the UPS truck. It ignores small (Tacoma) sized pickups. It always picksup my larger Tundra truck or my wife's Dodge Van. Still, it is better than nothing but it is also disappointing and NOT worth the $90 price... Cheaper technology from other vendors would also prove to be as unreliable as this one!"
2,Questionable,I bought the 30074. It works great... most of the time. My 4x4 Toyota Tundra doesn't get noticed. My wife's Dodge Town and Country does. Why? Can't say. New batteries. Sensitivity set to HIGH. Mounted about 4 ft above the road and about 6 ft from the near edge. ALso tech support NEVER answers!!! grrrr Better than nothing but not perfect.
1,Don't buy this useless piece of equiptment!,We installed this monitor at our home. It workedfor a few days then would work only sporadically. Italso false alarmed in the middle of the night. I calledtheir tech support who were hateful and gave advicethat did not help. I tried to return it but they would notrefund my money because I had it longer than 30 days. I did haveit for awhile before it was installed but I used it only a week.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
1,New Christmas present,"I mounted it 6ft high and about 50 ft from the receiver, with the receiver in sight. It has only detected one vehicle in front of it in about 25 times. Sensitivity is set to high, new batteries in it. I tried pointing it right to the receiver or away, nothing helps. Its a very worthless item."
2,Not Too Good,"I've had this device for about 2 years. It has very poor range, and works only 50% of the time. Plastic pool included broke early in the installation process. For the relative high price (I paid over $100 2 years ago), I expected a better result. Not recommended"
4,"Excellent Travel Book, A Must For Montreal!","This is a great book for people of all ages. It details the main attractions with great maps on how to get there. The subway map in the back helped out so much, and I didn't look all touristy with it. Its very descrite and light. I highly reccomend this book for first time visitors. Im not very good with directions, but if you have someone else drive while you figure out where you are on the map, its pretty simple. Plus it has a little section of French words to help you get around the city! The only problem we came upon was figuring how long it would take to get to the sites, just make sure you have plenty of time."
5,Fabulous!!,"If you've ever wondered about the life cycle of a dragonfly, then this awesome book is for you. The illustrations are superb and the writing is excellent and easy to understand. I'm passing this book along to my daughter's third grade class. I know they'll enjoy learning about one of nature's most magnificent insects, the dragonfly."
3,"nice, but hard to use button","great little light, but I find the button on the side hard to use accurately, seems like I always have to press it 3 or 4 times before I do it ""just right"", it's very finicky."
5,Mini Maglite Replacement,"I use this precision machined flashlight on the night shift because the ""white"" light accurately replicates fluorescent lighting for medical color code definition and contrast.Touch the on/off switch for instant on or push down for lock click on. Fits into a RiPoff CO-7 utility clip-on holster and is an excellent replacement for the AA size Min-Maglite. Uses three N type batteries which are a bit more obscure than AA...but go find rechargeable NMH batteries/recharger and yer set!"
5,Maglight anyone?,I bought mine at a day after thanksgiving sale. Ya...I woke up and got in line for the 6am opening. Saw this item on sale (white led) and my cousin said it was a great deal. Bought it and loved it ever since. Gave my mini mag to my daughter to play with. Bought the camping version for my girlfriend since the recent heavy storms blacked out her neighborhood so she used mine that night. What a lifesaver. Also order 2 more turbo torches too.
3,American-Jewish History,Most interesting. Many little known details about life on the prairie. It was tough being a pioneer. It was doubly tough being a Jewish pioneer.
4,Great X-itment,You will luv it!! Great stunts on skateboards that will make u wanna try skating!!! Just Plain SWEET!!
3,Clearly belongs to someone else,"This book was described as being in good quality, despite being used. There were no new versions available, so I went for it. I was disappointed to see that there was an inscription written in permanent marker right on the cover. Although I know it was used, I think it is creepy to know that Janie got the book from Grandma and Grandpa with love in 2001 (and sadly, gave it away). I will not purchase again from this seller."
5,Meeting yourself,"This is an intimate encounter with yourself through the practice of Zen. Meet yourself. Meet Kwong-roshi through ""Breath Sweeps Mind"". For wider distribution these great talks should definetly be available on CD."
4,Ultimate Sports,"This book is a great for sport lovers of all ages. I found this book to be interesting. It has sixteen awsome sort stories for you. I really quote ""Check this book out"""
5,Insightful,I'd never heard of this true story before.i want to read the book ricky Birdsong wrote. Thank you Dave and Neta for such an inspiring book.
3,Disappointed..didn't finish,"Hello, all. I am typically a hudge fan of the things Dave and Neta write. I have a hard time putting them down from start to finish; thus, was excited to start reading this one. This excitement was short lived. I was bored and having a hard time following the story and character development. After several attempts, gave up and have deleted off kindle. If looking at this, I would highly recommed going for one of their other books."
1,Titles Please!,"I agree with Tammy! I love 80s music, but I will not buy this if I can't view the title list."
3,Primitive Goons,"The heavy-handed early films of the Goons do not live up to the radio series. But, what the heck, here they are on screen in two historically interesting and entertaining films. The elusive short film ""Let's Go Crazy"" is amusing and I was thrilled to at long last find a video copy. Favourite line. When the waitress asks Sellers (in one of several roles in the film), ""What would you say to a little fish"", Sellers replies, ""I would say 'hello little fish'.""""Penny Points to Paradise"" could have been much better with a funnier script, more ad libs and the inventive direction of, say, a Richard Lester, a Charles Chrichton or a Basil Dearden. Never mind, it's wondeful to see the Goons on screen in their early days and it is amusing."
2,glacially slow until near the end,"There are only two reasons to stick with this slow-moving story to its end: (1)you enjoy reading page after page of household and shopping trivia about upper middle class families who can afford vacation homes, or (2) you're curious to see if any real action ever takes place. There is no tension in the first half of the book; no suspense, no real mystery. The action is concentrated at the end. The author employs a tactic used too often in female-centered mysteries; the murderer behaves like a gentleman the first time the protagonist gets too nosy, bopping her on the head but then delivering her unconscious body to her home. That behavior truly requires suspension of disbelief. Male readers in particular are likely to find the story terminally boring."
4,Just okay,"I am always in a rush to get the latest ""Faith Fairchild"" mystery and have read them all, however, this one wasn't my favorite. Too many characters and a boring ecoterrorist plot made this book drag on forever for me. Still, I'm hooked on this series and will anxiously await the next book."
2,product placement?,"This is a fairly mediocre mystery novel in a series I've always found enjoyable if not memorable. But this one has something I'd not previously seen in any book, though I've heard it is a new trend.Apparently the author isn't making enough money from book sales and has resorted to product placement. The frequent mentions of Walmart might have been overlooked, but the laudatory paragraphs advertising Home Depot in the middle of the book are startlingly obvious and strain credibility. (Good service? Not in my experience.) At any rate, advertising seeping into books is a terrible idea. Let's hope it doesn't catch on."
5,Engaging Mystery,"What a fun book! This is the second Faith Fairchild mystery I've read, and boy, what a great read! It's a book that the reader wants to take their time with, savor the words and the situations. This is a must series for Mystery lovers, both men and women!"
4,pretty pleased with this purchase...,"This a/c unit works pretty well. I'm in a space about 13' by 35' which is almost twice the size that this was designed to cool. I dont have much to base this review off of being that this is my first portable a/c (beats using a fan hands down). Other than it taking about 10-15 mins for the cooling element to disperse the coolest air emitted, it works as indicated.I havent had much time to play with the programming features or heater. This was a quick pick-up at home depot for $600. If anyone has any input or a better portable model to recommend in the same general price range, please do so. thanks"
5,Two Weeks From Tuesday is a true work of art.,"When I reviewed John's CD for Music's New Artist Review I was impressed with his expertise as a composer/producer as well as a performing artist. I picked this album and John as winners and I love it when a talent like his is being proven.From John's review of ""Two Weeks from Tuesday.""John Russo's new album ""Two Weeks From Tuesday"" has an easy going serene sound wrote and performed with the utmost of feeling and excellence. From ""Now That You're Gone"" to ""Your Light Shines On Me"" the entire album keeps you listening. Bravo, John!Sonji Rush"
4,Exposing Religious Strongholds In The Church,This book debunks the myth of tithing.No longer is tithing made to be a cure all or a magic fix it contract.The convenant we have as Christians is the blood Covenant.This is the one true covenant of Christianity.It is covered extensively. Scripture is used and is not confusing or between the lines. I like the father son/daughter outlook giving favor instead of it coming by money.I liked grace being uncovered.There is balance giving full credence to the scripture about supporting the minister. However it's free will offering and it's made clear it's not about stopping tithing but seeing where the real blessings lie; and that's in the blood!I recommend it hightly!
3,Less than what I expected,"I thought that this book would have tons of lists of tips and give lots of legal, but perhaps edgey advice, but it fell short. I didn't find it easy to read through, I didn't find lots of lists and tips, I like books like this to make it easier.I am sure the advice is sound, but what I found here didn't seem to live up to what the cover implied."
1,In the cup is okay but all the leaks rank this one a zip.,"I have had this coffeemaker a total of 6 weeks and I am awaiting the arrival of a replacement before throwing it into the trash. I didn't check the reviews before purchasing this one and that was a big mistake, however I hope to save someone else from the same error. After brewing, I have coffee on the hot plate and under the base. The design appears perfect of prohibiting it from dripping outside the pot (without ever having moved the pot during brewing) but it happens on a regular basis. It is also dripping down inside from someplace and stands in pools under the base, in different spots. Never again, Mr. Coffee"
4,I like Mr. Coffee,The only people who do not like Mr. Coffee are ones who wish it was named Mrs. Coffee!
3,2005 tribute,I purchased this to install an2005 Tribute modular sterieoninto a 2000 protege. The plug was the correct plug for the back of the stereo. However the plug was missing the illumination wire.ni ended up having to buy 2 of these harnesses and steal a wire and pin from the new one and figure out which pin on the stereo was illumination. It ended up working in the end however I don't understand why the illumination pin isn't installed because it is used on all model stereos.
4,old school style,"A very complete coverage of the subject matter. In the old school text book style. Years ago this was used as a trade school text book. This is one for the person that isn't sure that they understand what the subject is about. Its strictly just the facts of the subject. Has charts and tables of important information. It has been updated in the text but not in the pictures. If you buy this one as your first book you will either use it as a start of your collection, or be selling it and moving on to something else.I do own it."
2,Unlisted...not so good..,"Very cheaply made...sole is hard PVC...be very careful on slippery surfaces. Looks ok from a distance. Definitely can find better shoes for the same price, or spend 10-15 bucks more for significantly better quality!"
3,"okay for the price, but not fantastic","I bought three pairs of Unlisted shoes from Amazon, all on sale for the same price. I love two of the pairs and feel like I got a great bargain. This shoe however feels like a cheap shoe.The shoes look great, but the soles are thin and need more cushioning. Also, one of the buckles is already broken. They are slip ons regardless so the shoddy buckle is holding for now. (Both buckles are flimsy and the shoes feel cheap on inspection.)I do wear these maybe once a week so they're not horrible. Unlisted is a good brand, BUT some of their other shoes at the same price here on Amazon are turned out to be much better buys. On this pair, I wish I could pay a little more for something more solid and better cushioned."
3,A Witch's Measure of Time,"The size and presentation of this datebook is very comfortable, it's just a bit larger than a woman's hand. This spiral-bound calendar book has a nice color cover and seems very durable.Inside, you'll find much more than just 12 months of dates. This book has 144 pages, symbols for planet and moon movements, Wiccan holidays, herb lore, and the best days to plant and harvest.At least every other page has an illustration, many in the form of a woodcut.A nice surprise to this datebook is the inclusion of several seasonal recipes, such as ""Goldenrod Salad,"" ""Lammas Chicken,"" and ""Pesto Soup.""It would make a great gift if I could get myself to part with it, and the price is right."
2,irrelevant and unbalanced,"Now that Rumsfeld's perceived integrity and reputation is in the toliet, with litte chance of ever being rescued, this fawning book is pretty much irrelevant. I didn't think this book was terribly written, but now that Rumsfeld will go down as one of the worst Secretaries of Defense in this country's history, not very balanced."
1,Bizarre,"Anti-gay journalist Midge Decter (""Boys on the Beach"") offers one of the more astonishing screeds of the current reactionary ""revolution."" Good for unintentional hilarity but nothing else."
1,She Once Was A Serious Person,"Her right wing ideology has reduced her to parody status. Like someone swept up by a cult, Midge Decter has now written one of the most foolish books in recent times -- a swooning, girlish celebrity bio which purports to be about restoring old fashioned ideals about masculinity but really tells us far more about the author -- her social insecurities, her core shallowness and her neo-Stalinist mindset: everything for the betterment of the party, which in this case is right wing republicans. Don Rumsfeld as action hero.Oy vey!"
1,Disappointed,"I love Rummie. This book, however, offered no analysis, insight, or behind-the-scenes anecdotes. It is an empty book filled with run-on sentences, mysterious modifiers, and simple observations. Rumsfeld fans like me deserve better."
1,exercise in shameless sycophancy,"A reviewer for the American Conservative terms this book a biography of ""shameless sycophancy"". It is, like, Neocon meets Warmonger and promptly falls in love. To get this crappy piece of nonsense out of your system one needs to read the recently published antidote: ""Rumsfeld, His Rise, Fall and Catastrophic Legacy."""
2,A puff piece on Rummy.,"Rumsfeld, along with McNamara will be one of the controversial SecDef for quite some time. He certainly has made his mark on American history and on the U.S. Armed Forces. This book was published at the height of Rummy's popularity. Since that time, the Iraq War has gone through endless issues as the U.S. has become bogged down in this country. Rummy has since been thrown out of his job.The first four to five chapters are actually very informative. It is the last five that puff up Rumsfeld's image. Unfortunately, Rumsfeld did not quit in time. The last five chapters are hard to read. If you are a selective reader, check this book out and read the first five chapters."
2,"Wrting style detracts, low on detail","It took twice as long as it should have to read this book due to long sentences filled with useless qualifying phrases. Also, from birth to White house in 50 pages, many of which have full page photos? Rumsfeld is surely more interesting than that. Lacks even a respespectable level of detail."
4,Original and insightful,Midge Decter's blessedly compact and fascinating study of Donald Rumsfeld tells the story of how a 70 year-old guy became a sex symbol and how his appeal is tied to his Midwestern values and old-fashioned manliness. It's really great and a very good-looking book.
2,boring Boris!,"Tagged as the greatest Russian opera (must be for pedantics),yet sadly I found it a waste of my time and money (gladly nota fortune). I am but thankful to Mussorgsky for his ""Pictures"" but notfor this ""bald"" music drama."
2,missing full complement & expression of ukulele playing chords,"The chords selected by Jim were overly simplistic. For example, I used the internet to find same songs such as the Day-O (banana boat song) where Jim uses only 2 chords. I find that song on the internet using 4 chords which sounds more interesting when played (versus 2 chords). Using only 2 chords almost sounds monotone when played. I now look for songs with guitar chords and adapt them to my new ukulele, using a ukulele chord chart."
3,Violence and Abuse,"I searched for erotica in the bookstore one day, and they havemost erotica collections and S&M books, not much in-between, so Ithought I'd see what an S&M novel was like. I'd read parts of books with S&M in them, but never a book specifically for S&M fans.I knew there'd be spanking and whipping, but this two-books-in-one story was violent! Whipping, beating, rape, humiliation, slavery--and no mercy! It through me for a loop, I must say! The second story, The Peculiar Passions of Lady Meg, is a continuation of The Love Slave.Underlying all the violence and abuse, however, is actually an interesting story of three women who try to save their dignity. If you can get past the violence (or if you enjoy it but can see the underlying story), you might find Paul Little's ability to actually tell a story."

2,dimming out as time goes on,"I bought 1 this year, and I have not used it much since then. Today, I was out playing Frisbee Golf and found that the light is not even bright as my key chain LED. Went back home and found it is a lot dimmer than when I bought it. Not sure why...? The battery should last long time, and I know I have put less than 10 hours on the battery."
5,Quite happy!,"I bought this as a gift for the person I selected in the company grab bag, and I had a chance to test it out, and I must say, I'm quite impressed with the flashlight. I haven't tested it for shock or battery life, but the unit is quite bright and it was a nice gift for a person who liked gadgets."
5,Love this movie,I have watched this movie with my boyfriend and it seems as if i bought it brand new. It looks like new.
3,just ok,"Good basic idea, but goes for cheap jokes and the orgasm at the restaurant is stupid. Predictable and a few laughs."
3,BETTER THAN AVERAGE ROMANTIC COMEDY 3 1/2/ STARS!,"A good cast goes a long way in this familiar romantic comedy. I like Gerald Butler and I think he is really going in the wrong direction with his film choices lately, but I can't knock someone making a good living playing kiss and tell with these lovely actresses. This is pretty much a battle of the sexes comedy with nothing new, but it's a fairly enjoyable ride. If you like romantic comedies, there is no reason to miss this one."
1,Pure Garbage,"I thought i'd give this movie a try since i am a fan of rom-com's but wow, this movie is BAD. The acting was ok but the dialogue is just sexist, unecessarily crude and just plain dumb. & i don't mind crude movies as long as it's entertaining & hilarious (See 40 year old virgin & Superbad!) BUT this movie had none of those qualities. Gerald honey, you are cute but not cute enough to make this movie worthwhile. Bottomline: Don't waste 90 mins(or however long this thing lasts) of your life watching this crap."
1,A complete waste of money...I'd give it 0 stars if I could,"Fortunately I did not buy this movie. I would have been extremely upset if I had wasted my money on anything other than renting this trash. The premise of the movie is good, but everything else about it (except for the ending of it) was total trash.After seeing Gerard Butler in ""PS I Love You"", and seeing Katherine Heigl in (one of my favorite movies) ""27 Dresses"", I was excited to see this film. Well, my disappointment in the movie started about 10 minutes in to it. The jokes were raunchy and unfunny, and neither of the actors that I admired for their previous work were at their best in this ridiculously tasteless flick.Better luck next time, Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. The funniest parts of the movie were on the promo/TV commercial...and that's about how much of it is worth watching."
1,Repulsive,"Repulsively unfunny. I can't imagine anyone thought this film was actually funny. I was so disappointed. My two favorite actors together in a romatic comedy and it had to be the worst movie of the decade. I hope they'll come back together again, but in a much better film. They are so far above this. What happened to make them accept this work?"
1,Selling Expired Digital Copy,"Although the movie and blu ray is great, the digital copy has expired before I even purchased this item. This means I paid for something I actually didn't get."
4,surprisingly good and fun!,"I expected a somewhat raunchy movie, but wasn't sure if it would be fun or good. Surprisingly, it was both! Great chemistry between the actors, lots of fun, and even a decent plotline (tho, yes, you can predict the end; it _is_ a romantic comedy afterall :) I much preferred this to Knocked Up, which I saw a few comparisons to in the reviews. Heigl also did better than in 27 Dresses. Haven't seen Butler in much that I can think of, tho he has done a fantastic job voicing character in animation (How to Train Your Dragon). He did great here, with fun in his voice and eyes. My favorite movies are ones in which I can forget the actors are acting and this was one such movie."
5,Pure Fun,This movie is pure fun. There is never a dull moment and I laughed constantly. We need more good movies like this.
1,"Gerard Butler needs to stay away from romantic comedies and THAT is ""The Ugly Truth""",Length:: 4:40 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews The Ugly Truth. It was ok for one viewing but the type of comedy and the demographic they were supposedly aiming for didn't match.[...]
2,Don't waste your time,"You know the adage ""you can't tell a book by it's cover""? Well - you can tell a lot about this movie by it's cover. Hot chick and dark/hot dude hook up. It's not simply that the outcome is obvious, it's simply that every absurd gag in this film is beyond lame and you end up assuming that the writer/directors consciously tried to see how long a sober viewer with an IQ above 50 would sit and continue to watch.Odd as it may seem - Katherine Heigl is so unattractive and unappealing to men that she has trouble getting a decent date and keeping a boyfriend. She needs an idiotic, pompous Gerard Butler's help...""ooo,...he's so edgy - and that accent...oooo"" I thought his 15 minutes was up some time ago.Sure this is a chick-flick, but defines the worst aspects of that genre. If it helps you close the deal fellows....well...no...strike that. No deal (even with Ms. Heigl herself) is worth the torture of viewing this stinker."
3,3 Star strictly for Gerard Butler,"This one is HARD to read. It's better than ""He's Just Not That Into You"" as that never kept with the logic the title gives. I will say, if the ""facts"" Butler's character was spewing are correct, then I'd rather go ASEXUAL. The whole time he's making it seem like men ONLY want a slutty chick who'll blow them! I woul...d hope that was only part of it.There were moments I was ready to write it off and stop watching, but something kept me going. Of course you knew it would be the arrogant guy who'd fall for the girl by the end, but it didn't seem logical. To the core the main female will always be a control freak and the guy will always be rude and arrogant. The sex will be amazing, but in the end this couple would NEVER last. So why bother?!"
2,The closing scene typifies what's wrong with this film,"THE UGLY TRUTH has its moments. Katherine Heigl delivers an energetic, funny performance but unfortunately the rest of the film does not do justice to her comedic talents. THE UGLY TRUTH falls short of the Farrelly Brothers-level screwball sex comedy potential it shows from time to time. The final scene, where we see Heigl making love with the man she's chosen (Is it the exciting-but-rough edged guy, or the handsome, successful-but-dull guy?) but she is still wearing her bra. Come on! Gotta jump in with both, uh, feet, Katherine!"
2,Incredibly cheesey,"This movie was incredibly cheesey. First I have to say that Katharine Heigel is not my cup of tea. I don't much care for her, not sure what it is. Gerard Butler I enjoyed in ""PS I Love You""....however this is not that movie. It is not the actors, its just not that great of script. It had a rare funny moment, but certainly not worth wasting your money on. If you want to see this rent it instead of buying it...actually borrow it instead of wasting money on renting it.It is about Abby, a tv producer and Mike, a crude on air talent. Abby is a control freak, up tight and single. She runs a nice, vanilla morning show. Late one night she stumbles across a tv show called ""The Ugly Truth"" which she calls into outraged at the hosts advice. The next day at work she finds out they have hired that host. The host Mike helps her get the guy of her dreams and ..... big shocker, Mike is in love with Abby....and Abby is in love with him also."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!,i dont think i could love this movie more then i do.Alot of it is based on what chicks thing and what their actually willing to say.I cant even imagine if it could be better
5,great movie,"Very funny, but very adult movie!!! It's so true! You'll laugh until it hurts! (guys and girls both!)"
5,"A little crude, but worth every min!","This is a film you and your wife/GF/husband/BF and share and laugh together with. It is not a chick flick, but it is definitely about relationships from both sexes point of view. Funny as they get, and great acting. I wanted something with KH in it other than 27 dresses and Love Comes Softly. She is superb and GB is right on the money. Couldn't have been cast any better. Although the script was written by women, they know what they are talking about!My wife and I highly recommend it! Five stars!"
2,Really dumb movie,"If Gerard Butler is in it, a movie has to be pretty bad for me not to like it. This ridiculous piece of fluff is such a disappointment...could have been very witty but it wasn't even funny. Have to say it was so dumb it wasn't even offensive. Tried too hard, maybe. Doris Day and Rock Hudson meet the 21st century. Pretty bad the first time around, even worse with this duo."
2,disconnective,"Unappealing.Overzealous at inappropriate moments.Too much characterization of who/what is female or male. Yes, this was the story line yet it went too far."
5,This Movie is so fantastic,"I just really like this movie. I think Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler are amazing, and I was so happy to order this one online because I couldn't find it in not a multi-film pack in my hometown. Plus it's blue-ray, and came with a digital copy, which I suppose is kind of a double win. :)"
4,;0),Not bad best part for me she is at the restaurant and she had on the vibrating panties lmao that was too funny. Other than that liked the concept of the movie and both characters were good.
4,"Predictable, sexist, yet funny for 90% of men and open minded women","I can understand why on Yahoo 12 critics rated it a C- on average whilst 5k+ reviewers rated it a B+. The story is so predictable, sexist, rude and even vulgar. However, it did offer some good laughs from the very charming actors and the beautiful actress, in case you dont take the Ugly Truth, that men are lustful and the dream man never exists, so seriously. Not a bad choice of comedy for rental to spend an hour or two after a day's hard work. Definitely not for those who want to watch a love romance."
2,An ugly film.,"The Ugly Truth starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler is an unfunny look at the battle of the sexes. Yeah I admit, I just watched this rom-com because I think Butler is a total babe but even his perfect face can't save this trite film. There's WAY too many sex jokes and none of the them are hilarious. The ending was sappy and predictable, you can see it coming from a mile away. I don't know how Heigl became a leading lady, she can barely act and her comic timing is a mess. The Ugly Truth is one pretty ugly comedy, if you can call it that!"
2,Disappointing!,"Being that I really like both Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler AND I love romantic comedies I thought this would be a movie I'd enjoy. So what a disappointment this was especially since it has a fairly good overall rating on this site. I really wanted to like this movie but I hate romantic comedies with crude language flipped all over the place. I mean I'm no prude and use colorful language myself, but ugh, it doesn't add to the movie at all!I have to compare this to ""Someone Like You"" with Ashley Judd and Hugh Jackman. Similar type of situation but SO much better movie IMO.Apparently many more of you will like this movie, but I didn't."
4,Raunchy yet has some heart at times,"Despite the raunch and predictable plot, this movie has some great acting and touching moments that ring true. I rented it and watched it more than once. Every time I watched it....this movie grew on me. Hands down has the best dance scene and kissing scene of any movie of at least the past ten years. If you are of fan of Katherine Heigl or Gerard Butler....you'll love this movie for sure."
2,Not worth the watch,This movie failed on many levels! I was expecting so much more. It truly is not worth the watch.. A waste of acting talent from both these actors.
1,Offensive AND Boring,"There is nothing cute or funny about this movie. It is about a misogynistic man (Gerard Butler) who has a TV show on cable and gets recruited to be on a network news show with Katherine Heigl as his producer. It has a very thin premise of him ""coaching"" her on how to successfully snare a man and of course in the end they are supposed to fall in love as they both learn to understand the other gender. The jokes aren't funny and the stereotypes of men and women are just plain depressing. I am stunned this movie even got made."
2,we laughed a couple times,"true, we laughed a couple times... there are a few funny lines...but the shallow nature and the ""battle of the sexes"" was really like,""Ok we'll do Cyrano de Bergerac one more time, then the Shallow B**ch and the Male-Ego-Pig will end up together""which is EXACTLY what happened!"
4,Truth,"This movie is the best. Its real you can understand, funny. The only thing I dislike toward the end did not seem to be fair. My feeling"
3,Bought this out of curiosity,"Being the feminist that I am, I just had to watch this! First of all, Gerard butler isn't that hot. That other guy who played her doctor boyfriend was much hotter. I think the movie was pleasantly naughty and presented the truth in a funny manner. What I didn't like was the fairy tale ending, which is far from truth or real life. I believe men really are sex and self centered, and women have been brain washed from childhood to believe in a ""love"" fantasy. I believe this fantasy was created to control women and bind them to men. I enjoyed the movie very much until the phony ""love"" ending, but its a rom com, so I guess that was a mandatory ending , lol."
4,love this movie since 1st time i watched it!,"as for the blue-ray, well.. i don't get blue-ray. only got blue-ray to try it out in my ps3... seems same quality as dvd, and i do not give 2 poops about the extra stuff... darn should've looked for the dvd version it was probably cheaper -.-love this movie though <3"
5,So funny!,"I've got to be honest, I'm not much of a romantic comedy fan. But my girlfriend wanted to watch it, and I've got to admit, it's really funny. I'm a fan of Gerard Butler and he doesn't disappoint. I was on the ground laughing with this movie. THere are parts that are pretty sappy and cheesy, but overall, I really recommend this movie."
5,Very funny movie,"Very good movie. Got here in good time. The movie is not for kids, but if you want to laugh and laugh hard, this movie will do it. It's a little crude in places, but it will make you laugh"
4,Delightful,"The on screen connection between Heigl and Butler highlights the success of this film. Abbey, a hard working executive producer is faced with the challenging task of improving the quality of the show to increase the ratings. Herein lies the change, Butler comes in and provides a raunchy, unexpected and at times insightful analysis between men and women. The change not only increased the number of viewers for the show but led to a collaborating relationship between Abbey and Mike who ended up helping her landed her dream guy. I don't want to give away the ending for those who haven't seen it but it is worthwhile romantic comedy.This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again. There are both unpredictable and predictable events in this movie.If you enjoyed Maid in Manhattan (Jennifer Lopez) and/or Fever Pitch (Drew Barrymore). I think you would enjoy this one as well."
2,Not my cup of tea,At the very beginning of this movie you can tell that it's going to be very crude. I finished watching it hoping the whole time that it would get better. Sadly it didn't.
3,Cute Movie,"If you're wanting something light-weight and kinda fun, this is a good one for that. It's entertaining and has a Cinderella type of ending."
2,degrading production for both two talented actors and the viewers,"I looked forward to this movie when I heard it was on the way since I like both Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. But it was a disappointment and degrading to both men and women. I liked both actors much less after seeing it. Most of the slender plot moves forward with crude, slapstick-style humour (Katherine Heigl hanging from a tree with her entire lower half showing, the vibrating panties gag scene, a bodacious mud wrestling scene for Gerard where even he looks embarrassed to be there), and after the immature characters throw a fit and totally cut each other down, I was unable to believe in the kiss-and-make-up scene. On the one hand, such shallow people deserve each other, on the other, as shallow as they are, they are very unlikely to stick together through any challenge. A waste of time and mind space, in my view, don't fill your head with the trashy images and ideas contained in this movie."
1,Ughlly!,"Disclaimer: This movie rates no stars, but you have to choose at least one.What a disgusting movie! I got it as a gift from someone who said, ""Have you seen it? Oh, it's really cute!"" Um, if you like to be offended then it's about as cute as it gets.The movie it seems was produced by Heigl, who really has to re-examine how she wants to be thought of. I would not be proud to have my name all over this what-did-she-just-say?? piece of crap.I'm really not easily offended, so hats off to the Ugly Truth: you could get a prize for most potty mouth language and situations in one movie.I kept thinking it would get better, though I don't know why...and it didn't.When you read a review like mine, be assured: we speak the truth. Those of you who loved it: Did you actually watch it???The whole movie is vulgar, offensive, embarrassing...running out of words here. Heigl in 17 dresses, very sweet. Heigl in this stink bomb: Ew."
1,Waste of time.,"This is excruciating. It's not funny. It's not romantic. It's not sexy or witty or engaging on any level; even the gratuitous vulgarities are lame. It's so badly written, the actors never have a chance."
1,Gerard Butler sold out,"What a silly and trite movie - not even good comedy or romance. Gerard Butler is a great actor and has done some really good movies. This one was NOT one of them. If you want to be irritated by Hiegl and disappointed by Butler, then this is a MUST see movie - otherwise give it a big miss."
1,DON'T LET THOSE 5-STAR RATINGS FOOL YOU!,"Unless you want to spend time with crude sexual remarks, cliches, stereotypes and some of the boringness action on a screen, you do not want to see this movie. Read those other one- and two-star ratings and believe them. Then, if you must see it, try to watch it for free. I thought I could get through it because I like both Heigl and Butler, but after about fifteen minutes, I realized this picture had no watchable qualities."
2,Wrong Labeling,"The harness wire key did not correspond with what the actual function of the wires are. I had to go on the internet and figure out which wires did what. It added a solid hour to what would have been a 20 minute install. Maybe it is different on other models, but the labeling was incorrect for my 2000 xterra"
5,Nice quality,"The wire sleeves are pre-severed waiting for you to remove the bit of sleeve on the end for your sautering needs. The wires are all labelled - for example ""ignition switch""... The wires are all oem nissan thickness and pure copper. Nothing to complain about here."
5,it works,Not much to say. It works like its supposed to. It is made with robust materials: thick wires sturdy connectors. The wires were pre-stripped with plenty of of exposed wire to work with. The strands were tinned which made soldering very easy.
3,Harness hardship,Wires must be matched to existing leads. The markings are almonst impossible to read. The terminology on the wires is differt from that used in the wiring diagram. There is no diagram with the product.
4,Very handy to connect your new receiver with stock wireing,"All wires are color coded to match the vesicle's existing wiring. Simple, and easy to connect. wires are per-trimmed which saved some time. Great!"
4,Pretty good.,"Good for the most part, only discrepancy was with lighting wire. Instructions said to connect to the Orange/White wire, only had a choice of Orange or Orange/Black. Guessed right the first time (orange) and was in business."
5,Factory Headunit GONE,I had to have this product because I replaced my factory OEM head unit with an aftermarket Clarion Head unit. So it worked out just fine....
4,Foldable Chess Set,This chess set was a good purchase for a beginning chess player. The straps won't last long that are inside the case to hold the chess pieces in place while being stored. That just means that the pieces will be loose inside the folding case.
5,Enjoyed It!,"I really enjoyed this chess set but a little downside is the storage band is a little loose so it doesn't do 100% of its job, but anyways other than that I can store the pieces with the plastic bags it came with. I highly recommend buying this."
5,"Nice, compact game",Purchased this for my six year old and he is learning and enjoying the game. This is a nice little set with simple but good looking pieces on an attractive board that folds. This lends itself to great storage for the pieces. Inside it has holders for each piece but we've opted to use the two plastic bags enclosed to hold all of the pieces. When we they wear out or we loose them then perhaps we will use the holders. The size is perfect on which to play and take with you anywhere you go. The board itself is solid and feels very durable.
5,Classic Wood Folding Chess Set,"Nice chess set. Very good price. One piece was cracked a little bit, but it doesn't bother me, so I decided to keep it anyway."
4,needs better pictures of pieces.,Latch tab can be ground off so that the board will lay flat when playing. I used a dremel tool. Eyes of knight are faint and not placed the same location on all knights.
1,Pretty good,It was missing a black castle and had an extra pawn. Overall it was not that good compared to other chess sets i used.
3,Nice but cheaply made,"While this is a good and inexpensive wooden starter set, the design for holding the chess pieces is very cheap and broke within days. The pieces are made of very light and soft wood. fine as a starter set for kids, but something more durable would have been nice."
1,Missing Pawn,My set came missing an 8th pawn. ive even posted a video & am VERY unhappy about this!! How do i go about returning or new pieces?
4,Well-made with some felts missing,"I bought this to play with my visitors sometimes when they come over. You know, sit around, playing chess, have some tea, and chat, instead of playing some chess games on the computer. I don't use it very much. Maybe, twice a month. Thus far, I really like it. The board surface is very smooth, and well-made overall. The pieces are glossy and feels nice to touch.My only complain is that a Knight and a Pawn of mine are missing felts on the bottom!! I can live with that, so I didn't bother to get a replacement from amazon.com, but it's something you should be aware of. Check for the felt on the pieces first thing when you received it."
5,A perfectly decent chess set,"I ordered this as a Xmas gift for my son and it is a perfectly decent chess set for the money, nothing more nothing less. The pieces are right sized & decent, medium-quality wood and the board itself is nice - not exotic, not too shabby, just right.The straps that hold the pieces in place for travel are a nice addition. I am satisfied with this chess set."
3,another gift,"Bought this for my son as he suggested he may take up learning to play. The board was nice and didn't cost alot so if his interest doesn't progress, I'm not upset."
4,Nice gift,"It was a gift for someone else, but they reported to be very happy with it. It arrived in a timely fashion and was securely packaged."
3,hand-carved pieces are not wood,"The chess board is really nice and big, but a bit misleading in that the pieces seem to be plastic."
2,Cheap,"For the price I suppose its decent enough but the latch/sides don't meet up properly when folding it together. Also, the little elastic straps on the inside to hold the pieces broke the first time I tried to use them. Additionally, the top of the board is beveled and looks like its going to come off any second."
2,Paid too much for a piece of crap,"I bought this chess board to teach my 6 year old how to play and I am giving it a low rating because I do not think that the price I paid reflects the product, to be blunt it is not worth the price. The pieces are so light weight which makes playing hard because they topple over easy. There are bands in the inside of the board so you can store each individual piece which is a nice feature and I like it. I also found that the board has problems closing. You can smell real wood when you play the game which is nice but I would imagine that it would be a nicer board and its kind of generic. Do not waste your money on this board."
5,rock'n'roll with a lot of soul,"The swedish band Mazarine Street is the best band right now, if you like rock'n'roll. The singer sings with alot of soul and screams almost as Make up's singer does but this is far more heartfull. The albums strongest song is the only ballad, ""Telephone wires"" it's super. All together Beast is a great party or ""wake up"" record that you can't afford to live without if you like Make up, Jon Spencer, Hellacopters, Gluecifer, monster magnet or turbonegro. Mazarine Street is the best however.Cheers!"
5,Excellent.,"Fortune Teller is a vast improvement over their first album: Anger Management. Anger Management was a good album, but Fortune Teller just kicks.... If MindCandy keeps improving at the rate they're going, they'll be the greatest band in history in no time. Buy the album!!!"
3,Shielding issues but works ok,"Like a few of the other reviews, I too was having trouble with noise. I tried all the different filters with no luck. I finally grabbed some tin foil and wrapped the base and that solved the problem. It seems to have a shielding issue. I used my on a control4 system. I ran a few blasters out in my network cat5 to tv's around the house and went to add one more when I reached the limits of the HC300 blaster output."
1,Doesn't work with Samsung Plasma,As others have stated my Plasma TV generates enough IR noise that it overwhelms the sensor in this and keeps the signal from reaching the gear its intended to control. It comes with some filters to put in front of the sensor that severely limit its range to the point where it just didn't work for me. If you have a LCD or Plasma TV there's a good chance this may not work for you. Mine is going back :(
4,Good Device,"It works as advertised, but is easily confused in the presence of bright fluorescent lights. It comes with a darkened lense cap, but that reduces the accuracy of the detection. It also comes with small filter disks to insert behind the clear lense, but those also reduce the accuracy of the detection. I ended up removing the bright fluorescent lighting from the area, and the problem went away."
2,"This is a FAUX leather case , not a genuine leather case","The case is functional and as pictured and described. I was expecting a genuine leather case for this price. It is not genuine leather. This is an artifical leather case. The finish and packaging is similar to other ""Made in China"" cases I have purchased in the past. Unfortunately, the piece I received has a flaw in the front panel with which looks like a piece of string or air bubble glued by mistake under the artifical leather. As I live overseas , returning or exchanging the item is unviable for me."
4,"Nice, just slight misalignment of screw that oen and closes","As with anything made in the ""big C"", you can't expect perfection in every unit. When I thread (close) or unthread (open) the center threaded bolt via the handle, it binds on a section of each turn of the threaded bolt. But that's minor, and a little extra grease helped a lot."
3,Heavy Duty,"Pooly packaged. Inner box and wrapping beat up, vise has chipped paint - appear to be a return. Otherwise the vise was in good condition. Made of cast iron and steel. Smooth jaw face and pipe clamp. Jaw is lined up very well. There is no retainer ring or roll pin to keep jaw from being completely screwed out. Actual safe jaw opening is 2 1/4"". Actual clamp opening is 1 7/8"". Would be an excellent vise with a stop for the jaw opening. Roll pins can be installed on the guide bars to stop it at 2 1/4 inches. If you go past that, the jaw grip will weaken since there are fewer threads in the base (cast iron) to grip onto. Worth keeping though. Just remember to put no heavy objects in the vise wider than 2 1/4 inches."
4,Fun Page Turner,"Don't let the casual, laid-back setting mislead you. This is a page-turner. This Magical Mystery Tour has come to take you away, and it does. The gigs, the van later on the way home, and most of all, the misadventures...we've all been there. But the outcomes are unexpected and engaging, with an ending that leaves you completely satisfied.A great summer read."
4,"Robert Earl Keen ""Live from Austin"" DVD - Great Texas Southern Country Rock!!!","THIS IS A VERY GOOD CONCERT DVD BY ROBERT EARL KEEN AND HIS 7 PIECE BAND!!! This one's a ""Keeper""!!! It contains 17 very good songs. It contains the Johnny Cash song ""I still miss someone"" and the Towns Vandt Zant song ""Snowin' on Raton"". The other songs have a southern,country theme to them. It was recorded on August 22, 2001. This is a very good dvd, and I recommend it. Thanks, and may God Bless!!!"
2,Robert do you have a wad of chew in your mouth,"I've listened to REK for a while and was looking forward to this dvd, watched it once and put it at the back of my collection. I think you should be able to understand and hear what a singer/songwriter is relating to you. I couldn't understand enough to be related to. This is one of those productions that you wonder about and go ""why?"""
2,Pass on this one!,"After watching this one, I would recommend the #2 Live Dinner dvd over this one, I was disappointed to say the least!"
5,blue topaz ring,"The ring is very beautiful, much richer and higher quality than the picture shows. I am very pleased."
5,Ooooh pretty,"I love this ring, its stones are super sparkly and the detailing on the side of the setting is exquisite."
2,color not as shown,The color of the stones are not like they look on the picture. They are look brighter and look like they are colored glass.
2,"The book lacks depth, imagination, and vocabulary.","I was disappointed in this book by Howard Fast, yet found myself finishing it. His lack of imagination in vocabulary matched his lack of imagination in the courtroom scene. I was hoping not to have to read another ""wonderful"" or ""sweet"" or ""too old"" or ""I love you so much"". Even the proofreader needed help --- missing quotation marks for instance. Yet, perhaps for people in their seventies who hope for true love and a return to a zest for life, this would be a good book."
1,Put any sensitivities aside.,"This writer is coasting on his reputation. Where was his editor? Repetition and lack of imagination fill every page. And if you are Catholic, Irish, female, Caucasion, don't have liberal views, and alot more, you may want to skip this boring read. He seemed just way to ""perfect"" for my liking."
3,Entertaining but unoriginal,"I hate to sound like an echo but I have to agree with the previous reviewer who found the book to be rather unimaginative but finished it anyway. I felt the same way. It was entertaining and kept me turning pages but all the while I was cringing at the unoriginal and unrealistic dialogue and waiting for a surprise twist of some kind. The best way to describe this book was as a light, easy read that was interesting but not truly memorable."
1,"The outline was sophomoric, totally unbelieveable.","Howard Fast was obviously fullfilling a publishers committment. This was the most inane, painful book I have ever read. The author should be ashamed to put his name on this book. I bought the book because of the author's name, feeling I would have a good read - wrong! I am disgusted."
3,"Not the best..but not the worst, either.","I read this book in one sitting. I liked all the characters, especially the saucy Sarah, who ultimately ""saves"" Elizabeth Hopper from a prison sentence.I liked the courtroom scenes and I liked the romance. I agree with other reviewers that the language, proofing, and editing could have been better, but it was, for me at least, a good night's read."
4,exhillarating!,"I've given Broadway: The leadingLadies 4 stars not because it isn'tabsolutely great, thrilling andgoose bumpy, but, because the performances are not great across theboard. In fact I found myself getting bored during some of it.The opening number from Chicago isa stand up and cheer one that isthe next best thing to being there.I want to say that the visual andaudio recording quality are stellarmaking it that much more pleasurable to watch.Linda Eder, Andrea McArdle, LIZA,and some others give really goodperformances..but it is the greatJennifer Holliday that gives a performance that I have had to rewind and rewind over and over againit's that good. The audience thinksso too. She is the ONLY ONE theystand for in ovation at the endof any one performance that night.That performance alone is worththe price of admission."
1,Worthy of PBS Fund Drive Material,"Certainly not my favorite Broadway. This is the sort of pastiche that seems to thrill certain East Coast city dwellers who dream of dressing up and going on stage and being STARS. Boring. Give me a good old drag show anyday. At least it is honest. ANOTHER ATROCITY, to quote one of the tired reviewers here."
5,GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!,"I originally got this for Jennifer Holliday's ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"". However, this entire DVD is so awecome I was mesmerized during the entire thing. I highly recommend this for an avid musicals buff."
4,"LINDA EDER, OTHERS SURE TO PLEASE...ELAINE STRITCH! OUCH!","This is a great Broadway dvd. The color and sound are incredible. The performances are super, too. The one that stands out is Linda Eder's version of ""Man of La Mancha."" What a voice! Incredible performance. Nell Carter and Jennifer Holliday did well, too. Liza was ok, but in need of more emotion. This would have received five stars if not for the horrid performance of Elaine Stritch. What, exactly, was she doing? Her voice needs to retire with the rest of her weary body. Disgraceful!"
3,"Where is Chita, Bernadette, Patti Lupone...?","I saw this show from the last row. I didn't care, Chita Rivera was scheduled to perform! She didn't. Nevertheless the show was fun. My only complaint is it relied too much on 3 newcomers and left out the older ladies. Having said that, check out Audra McDonald singing Down With Love, it's perfect!"
4,One question,"This show was simply wonderful but I'd like to pose one question,""Where was Bernadette Peters?"" I love her voice and I was disappointed that she did not appear in this show."
4,Mogrobejo on Basque sur-names,"Mogrobejo, Endika. 1996. Diccionario Etimologico de Apellidos Vascos. 3rd Edition. Editorial Morobejo-Zabala. Bilbao Spain.This has proved to be a useful book for scholars and genealogists. It contains with many leads from the ancient Basque language for these purposes. For example there is a place in Cuba called el ""Oro de Bayamo"", which has been made notorious by a Batist massacre in which it was incorrectly called ""El Oro de Guisa."" The name does not refer to gold as one might at first assume from the Spanish word. but to:Oro: Eminencia, altura; lugar de avenas; agua; cima; solar. Outlook, height, place of oat fields; water; peak; ground on which a house is built.This plus the use of the article El before the name can much more readily be taken as the origen of the Bayamo River, which much more correctly describes the place where El Oro de Bayamo is found."
2,Poor QA by Wilson Jones,"I ordered 3 Wilson Jones 3"" hanging binders. Two of the binder were not usable. Amazon did replace them quickly, however the two replacements still had split covers. They can be used but needed to be taped."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS UMBRELLA! The cheap aluminum base snapped at the sand level in moderate winds--on a nice sunny day--the second day we used it. Thankfully, our 20 month-old daughter wasn't underneath it when it happened. We gave the company the chance to make things right and sent them pictures of the broken base bent at a right angle. It's been two weeks and we've received no response. You can do better for the price from another brand."
4,It is great!,Phoenix is very hot. I like to garden and can't take the heat of our Arizona sun. I bought the beach umbrella for that reason. It does provide shade but was disappointed that so much heat still comes through.
2,Consider this a disposable umbrella,"We purchased this last year and used it on one vacation. It was easy to set up and use, and it was sufficient for protecting us from the sun. However, on the 5th day of our trip, a strong gust of wind bent the umbrella at a 90 angle and when we straightened it back up, it broke completely. Given the price, it may still be cheaper than renting one for the week, but don't expect to get too much use out of it beyond one or two vacations."
2,made me nervous,"I took a chance with this one, knowing that it received mixed reviews. We anchored it nice and deep in the sand and it seemed secure. However with a gust of wind the material turned upside down and it seemed like the umbrella was going to go flying. I did not use it for the rest of my trip because it made me too nervous. Other people's umbrellas which appeared to be more flimsy, were staying up, but this one I just didn't feel comfortable with. HOpefully, we can find some use for it on our deck at some point, but when I go back to the beach I will buy something smaller ."
3,Nice umbrella but difficult to keep up,"We bought this umbrella due to all the wonderful reviews. It is big, sturdy, and beautiful. The downfall is that it comes with a rubber sand anchor already attached that doesn't hold well in the sand. Ours actually started falling apart so we will cut it off and use a regular sand anchor for it."
2,Thin metal shaft,"Umbrella worked OK for the first several times, however the shaft bent and snapped at the site of the telescoping insertion during a small wind gust.The flaw in the construction is in the area where the lever is inserted through the shaft in order to screw the umbrella into the sand; this weakens the metal and is the site where it snapped."
5,Great Umbrella,"This umbrella is fantastic. It's large so you are very protected from the sun. However, it's light and carrying it around the beach is very simple to do. Setting it up takes maybe two minutes. I actually had a guy at beach come over and help us set up. He rents umbrellas at the beach and he was very impressed with this umbrella. The price is a little high but I'm glad I got it. It's thick and sturdy and transports very easily!"
3,"Eh, it's ok","Pole is super light and bent slightly after digging it in the sand. Otherwise, typical umbrella. Wish I would have kept my old base because im worried this one will break"
4,Beach Umbrella Review,"I like the umbrella but will admit that it is a bit thinner in material than I would have preferred so I hope it keeps the sun's rays out as I would like. The one comment I think anyone ordering needs to pay attention to is that this umbrella already has an auger type base so you DO NOT need to order an ""sand anchor"" with this even though it shows on the site as something people order in addition to the umbrella. In fact PLEASE NOTE that the umbrella doesn't even fit in the anchor because of the augar shaped based so don't order the anchor as you will end up as I did with an anchor you can't use. I do also like the larger size of this umbrella."
5,great umbrella,"We used this for a week in the Outer Banks of NC, and it held up flawlessly, even on high wind days. There is a screw type anchor built in on the pole, but you'll probably want to opt for a larger anchor like the ""Beach Umbrella Sand Anchor by JGR Copa"". We used this one and it worked much better than the stock anchor (you have to cut off the stock anchor first, which we didn't know until we were already on the beach the first day and didn't have the necessary tools with us).The only flaw with the umbrella was that the tightening screw on the anchor put pressure on the umbrella pole such that the wind caused it to bend slightly at that point. It's more the anchor's fault than the umbrella's. The next time we use it, I'm going to insert a length of pipe into the umbrella pole to add extra strength at that point so it doesn't bend again."
2,Broke after 7 days on the beach,"What everyone has said prior to me is true.1) Get a beach anchor - it blows away easilyIn a 10 mph wind in Ocean City, NJ, the umbrella uprooted itself even WITH a beach anchor and angling the umbrella into the wind2) The metal beam of the umbrella bent under the force of a 10 mph wind! When I went to bend the pole back, it snapped in half. This was only after the 7th time I used it, so needless to say, this is a poor value for the price. I think the problem is that it's too big and the pole isn't sturdy enough. It catches a lot of wind, where a smaller umbrella doesn't.Luckily, I bought this umbrella on sale for $40, and even then, I'm upset that it didn't even last one season. I would not recommend you buy this product if you are looking for a long-term umbrella."
2,Rainbow 8' beach umbrella,Colors are great. umbrella easy to carry and handle. BUT if very windy the umbrella pulls out of the bottom section. i got hit in the head with it and it flew away. this could be dangerous and someone could get hurt.
2,Not For The West Coast,We bought this beach umbrella last spring in anticipation of our mid-May trip to Coronado in San Diego. We even bought the Rio Sports Sand Anchor to go with the Rainbow 8' Beach Umbrella with carry bag. My son set it up on the Silver Strand Beach on Mother's Day Sunday. The umbrella was in place for about five minutes while my son sat under it. The wind then picked it up and started to blow it off the beach. My son chased after it all the way into the parking lot. It was about to blow into the roadway right before he finally caught it. We noticed that everybody else at the beach had umbrellas or shade tents with four big wooden poles that they hammered down to withstand the wind. I can't imagine anyone using this umbrella except maybe at a Gulf Coast Beach in the middle of the summer when there's absolutely no weather at all. Either that or you might use it in your own backyard.
5,Excellent,colorful and recognizable on the beach. Nice wide span to block the sun and the screw end makes it easy to get into the ground.
1,"Love the umbrella, not the best made product","We purchased this umbrella for a trip to the coast, expecting sun and wind. The umbrella itself is great- we were able to enjoy the beach with our baby, completely shielded from sun and wind by adjusting the umbrella. Even our dogs were able to lay in the shade. No extra parts needed to stabilize. The down side is the carrying strap broke the second time we were carrying it down to the beach. We also noticed problems with the stitching on the umbrella itself (stitching completely missing between two colors) -not actually falling apart- yet. While the umbrella was great for our week's vacation, it was very difficult to cart it down to the beach and back without a carry-on strap, and we don't know how long it will last in its unstitched form. E-mail to the seller did not generate any response at all...recommend purchasing an umbrella like this from someone else who will assist if problems with the product."
1,Worst experience ever,"I thought this was a premium umbrella I could use for years, but it turns out it is complete junk on the first try.I was excited about this new umbrella, but it was a disaster from the moment we arrived at the beach. First, it has no auger for drilling into the sand (in contrast to what some reviews say). Next, the lever-type latch that attaches the umbrella to the base is complete junk -- the lever does not retract. So it took me about 6 tries to jiggle the umbrella into the base pole and lock it. When I finally did, I noticed that the umbrella fabric was completely unattached at the top, and all of the ribs had fallen off of the fabric. That took me another 20 minutes to fix.Finally, after the umbrella blew away and we decided to leave, I couldn't get the umbrella back into the bag because the fabric remained unattached at the top of the umbrella. Push the umbrella into the bag, and the fabric bunches up and slides down."
1,Bad design -- pops off in wind -- try Beachmall 8-ft HvyDuty,"Purchased this umbrella in 2010. Worked fine for a few times, but the lever design which holds the umbrella on the top pole into the lower pole is very poor. It loosened and umbrella goes for a sail in even low winds. Tried securing with lashing to hold the lever down, but this is a time-consuming set up and still doesnt do the job in higher winds. Just purchased the 8 ft. Heavy Duty Beach Umbrella UPF100+ with Tilt - Fiberglass Ribs from Beachmall on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P98PO0/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_detailsCosts $69.99 and worth it. Top pole snaps securely into bottom pole. Umbrella has silver lining coating and really blocks the sun (unlike the Rainbow) - as a SPF of 100 vs the SPF 50 for this one. Sturdy pole. Surprised how light it is. Use with a well dug in sand anchor and I'm good for gusty beach days. Finally!!"
2,Paid over 18 weeks ago and no Mag yet!!!,I have bought the magazine from a local book store and there is no doubt this is the best photo & Photoshop mag ever. The subscription however sucks!!! I paid on July 2nd it is now Nov.9th - over 18 weeks later - come on!!! - Really? It would get here quicker if you just stick it in a bottle and throw it in the Atlantic. If you can't get the subscription right perhaps I'll just buy it at the store every now and then.
5,Digital Camera Magazine - true excellence for the photo enthusiast,"This is a a truly high quality magazine - lots of detailed ""how-to""s, relevant current topics, great project ideas and extremely well written. Even the kit test section is very well done- not trying to get you to buy substandard equipment. Also very fair in giveing equal time time to different camera types- not an all Nikon or all Canon publication.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in digital photography!"
1,"Boring, boring","I love cottage style and have a nice collection of books. Based on consumer reviews I bought it and boy was I disappointed. It was, to say the least, a snooze as far as the photos go. Since I cannot afford to buy a home presently, I love to get lost in the photos of a wonderfully photographed book. This is NOT one of them."
1,"Hopelessly tragic, so much it is actually funny","If you are looking for a book that actually teaches you something about relationships...look farther. Mr. Love has a grasp of the English language as strong as any toddler has of metaphysics. Whether it is his remarkable ability to mix verb tenses or the occasional misspelling of words, Mr. Love's book will provide hours of entertainment. On this, I suspect he actually wrote at least two of the previous three reviews judging by the similar style of writing.All details aside, you may ask how Mr. Love actually grasps the dynamic between men and women? Unfortunately, I no longer have my copy of this work to provide you with actual quotations of Love's wisdom, but suffice it to say his understanding of the male-female dynamic is somewhere on the level of SNL's Leon Phelps, aka 'The Ladies Man'.Those of you familiar with The Ladies Man might actually get some enjoyment out of this book if you try reading it with his tone of voice, I know I did."
3,damaged but usable,The plastic was warped and a few of the pins were bent. I had to straighten the pins then pry the plastic open to fit the wiring harness connector in. The wiring color codes were well documented on the package.I ordered this with a Scosche MA1537B installation kit. The face plate of the dash mount was broken when I received it. I had to have it exchanged.
4,A Smart Little Find.,"I very nicely shot film from the emerging South Korean movie industry. Using an Alternate Present setting to explore the tense history of Japanese/Korean relationships it draws the viewer into both an intense friendship, and powerful action sequences.The weak point in the movie is certainly the gimic that allows the plot to take place, which exists but is never really explained well. I would also be hesitant to recommend it to anyone who hasn't at least a passing understanding of the Japanese/Korean history."
4,Interesting topic,I rented this movie and enjoyed it enough to look in to buying it. If you're a sci-fi fan you'll like it. Some say you need an in-depth understanding of Japanese/Korean politics to grasp it but I don't think that's the case. I thoroughly enjoyed the flick and it actually inspired me to look up more information about the tense relationship between these 2 countries.
4,A well-done drama,"I really liked the movie, but it may be incomprehensible or tedious to those who are not familiar with the Korean and Japanese history of the past one hundred years. What if the Japanese could go back to the past and change history so they emerged victorious from the WWII and still kept Korea as a colony to-date? Given the potential repercussions (e.g., Hiroshima and Nagasaki may remain intact), what would one do to change it back or keep the status quo? The film is mostly drama with some action sequences and a crucial sci-fi twist. The best scenes are between the two main actors (Dong-Kung Jang and Toru Nakamura) whose friendship feels so genuine that their inevitable end is more poignant for it. Their relationship puts a personal touch to an intergenerational conflict between the two countries."
2,"If you don't martyr yourself, all the martyrs before you will have died in vain.","Both sides of this story are retarded. Why would the Koreans fight to have their country split between China, North Korea, and South Korea even if the Koreans in this alternative history are treated like crap. And I don't understand why Japan being able to hold onto Korea and Manchuria would prevent them from going for the Philippians and other countries.The time travel element does not shed any light about the current state of affairs. What we really need is a story where a Chinese, a Korean, and a Japanese person get stuck on and island and hash it out. Or perhaps an Asian Mark Twain needs to show how pointless honor can be.Something about the dialog and filming has a lot of emotion behind it which is why I give it more that one star. Also its hard to deal with Japan's past. Both the Germans and the Japanese have difficulty talking about it."
4,"Well researched, poses interesting questions","I bought this book because of natural curiosity I've had since I read DeMille's ""Plum Island"" a few years back. Carroll obviously spent hundreds of hours over a few years meeting Lab workers, newspaper reporters and people infected with unusual diseases. My only criticism is that in the end, too much is left to the imagination. That said, the author brings to light many events that I never knew about as a native Long Islander. Later in the book Carroll discusses the lax security that has plagued the island, even in the years since 9/11. Well written, very interesting...I definitely recommend it (especially if you are big fan of conspiracy theories)."
4,Worth your time!,Quick read that will really make you question your government. While the intentions were good in the beginning..it just goes to show what happens when we get lazy about certain things (security) and start neglecting important details.This one will have you scratching your head about the intelligence of our government. I only wonder if this would happen in a post 9-11 America.
3,Like the ideas but...,"the ""Canadian"" geese inaccuracy is pretty disturbing. Didn't this guy talk to any real biologists/birders? Am only a third of the way through the book, and don't think it's written very well. Again, good ideas, but repetitious to the point of being hackneyed."
5,GREAT!,"If you care about YOUR future, this is the book you must have!Martyn Babitz, Esquire - Author of THE ILLUSION OF FREEDOM: How To Restore The True Constitution And Reclaim Liberty Now"
5,Life Changing!,I bought this book heading to the airport going back to China where I worked to pack my stuff up an move back to the States just after getting laid off. By the time I hit Seoul I was so positive about my life and what was ahead of me it was incredible. I sat in the Seoul airport and continued to read the book and do the exercises. This book has changed my life. I have been able to have a positive outlook on my future and move on beyond all that happened. I'd hate to think of how I would have faced the situation without this book falling into my life. I am now back in the States ready to take the on the world and starting my new job on March 10th.
5,Fantastic !,"Just can't miss any of the part in this book, it really helps a lot. All the details in this book may not be helpful to you, but you will definitely find a part that can influence your whole life ! I am not exaggerating, it changes your point of view towards your life, you will become a more positive and aggressive person than ever you can imagine. Make sure you have read the details, then you will figure out how Brian Tracy has taught you a wonderful lesson that you won't figure it out by yourself within a very short time. If you wanna be a successful person, read his book and practice in your own life, you will see miracles happen for sure."
1,String of Platitudes,"This book reads like the author collected the most-often repeated platitudes from every other self-help book ever written and strung them together in this one. This kind of writing just won't cut it any more; the bar has been raised -- for example, in Mark Victor Hansen & Bob Allen's ""The One Minute Millionaire""."
3,Introductory Level,"A nice book. Introductory in nature. If you are new to the circumstances, it will for sure give the introduction level very basic info."
5,"Loved this book in junior high, love it now","This is a wonderful story. I am so glad it is back in print. Other than Pride and Prejudice, this was one of my favorite novels as a teen. It has held up over the years. It is still a well written, lovely coming of age story."
1,Nine stars DZT-8-2W infrared touchiness motion sensor trash can,"I got the item today. Obviously, it has been used! Some stinks on the bottom and battery cover! I'm very disappointed!!"
2,Poorly Designed,"I've had a stainless automatic trash can in my kitchen for many years and totally love it. I purchased this smaller one for a bath room. It's designer must have assumed no one would want to use a trash bag/liner with it. The handle on the hard bucket insert makes keeping a trash bag in place impossible. If you remove the handle it is extremely hard to pull the bucket out to change the trash bag. If you want to wash out the bucket insert constantly, go for it. If you prefer to use trash bag liners, choose another design."
4,Great trashcan,"One of my ex-girlfriends got me this trashcan in 2003. It finally broke on my last year (note, it was the lid itself that broke, the motor still works) and could not find it again up until now.I have to honestly say using it daily for 9 years (did NOT have to change the batteries ONCE). This thing took a beating and kept on ticking.Granted, the build ""feels"" cheap, but it lasted me almost 9 years. Definitely ordering another one!"
4,infared touchless trashcans,"ordered two of the same; both came on time. Only problem, one works great, the other works just okay (lid opens only part way, defeating the touchless purpose)."
1,Hoobastank Up the Place ?,"WTF - is it my imagination or are all rock bands now using the same muscicians and singers ? Seriously , I think there are about 5 or 6 guys out there who are competing with themselves under 50 band names . Hey it worked for Amway . That is all these new bands are (consumer product) with zero awareness of art . There is no talent here , in fact the songs sound like something that would be on kids television but with a distortion box on the guitar. These ""wet-behind the ears"" type bands are only mimicking the other discharge they hear and picking up a guitar etc to follow the pack . Real artists have a calling and do it because they are driven. These guys just want to do enough to get laid and it shows .Keep up the good work boys , in a few years you may get a chance to work with Nikelodeon.Total waste and should be sacking groceries . Save your money , I did ."
3,So- So,"I would say this album is so-so. Yes, the lead singer puts a lot of emotion into his music, so some of the songs are very enjoyable to listen to. I didn't like ""The Reason"" too much, mainly because it was overplayed. I would say ""Disappear"" is my favorite song. I LOVE the tune and what it's about. It becomes so mesmerizing. The first time I heard it was on the radio, and immeadiatly after the song was finished, I downloaded it! It's that good! I would recommend this to people."
3,the same thing i heard before,"is it just me, or is this cd not the same as the first one.....exactly the same! after putting this in and listening to this very short cd , i felt like i wasnt listening to a new cd, but one ive heard before. the reason is a typical hoobastank type sound in a pop like rock style. when i first heard out of control i was like wow they got a lot harder in there music.......not true. dont be fooled by this song, its the only hard rock songon the album. the rest is all like the reason...very pop like. the cd is ok but too short and too weak. i hope there next cd will be better"
3,i expected more,"hoobastank's debut was ridiculous.i listened to it nonstop and was excited for ""the reason"" and after hearing ""same direction"" i was even more excited.""same direction"" is the best song on here, and ""out of control"" is very good too.""just one"" is a good rock track and ""never there"" brings back memories of ""crawling in the dark"".when they try to go too mellow, it's bad.""lucky"" is hard to swallow and that song ""the reason""-IT IS HORRENDOUSLY AWFUL.who could say it's a good song?when they are heavy they are doing things right, but when they go mellow, it tends to fall flat."
1,Icky,"Absolutely atrocious! About as proufound, lyrically, as a thirteen year-old girl's diary. Popular music in a sad state of affairs if the music buying public is actually taking this sort of trash seriously. The Reason is nothing more than a pop-culture afterthought, the product of image driven, corporatized muck. It is the kind of disposable music that will be forgotten within the year, I guarantee it."
1,"I'm sorry, but its bad.","Excuse me for saying, but this release is one of the worst of 2004. Maybe I'm biased, since I was never the biggest Hoobastank fan, but their previous CD had enormous potential. Unfortunately, it was thrown away for some production value. Their songwriting talents mirror that of a seventh grader. Take the title song for instance. No matter how cute and catchy you think the song may be, the bottom line is that it is terrible. Absolutely terrible. The real crime is that this album was nominated for a few Grammys. So many artists out there are releasing music that actually makes a difference, actually means something, and yet they are overshadowed by recycled lyrics. Pitiful."
1,Ohhhh what a letdown.....,"First, let me say how much I LOVED their first album. I can listen to it nonstop for weeks at a time and still not get sick of its variety.Now, for the honesty of this album...Two words: IT SUCKED.There were about 2, maybe 3 songs that I could tolerate. The Reason (of course), Out Of Control, and What Happened To Us?. I don't mean to be mean, you know, but it's like, I don't want anybody else to be sucked into buying the album."
2,Overrated,"I cannot for the life of me figure out what all the hype is about ""The Reason"". Yeah, its a pretty little pop ballad that could be a good slow dance song or a good makeout song, but the musicianship is pretty bad in it. Its really preditable and the guitars in the chorus sound really uninspired and just... bad. Out Of Control is a pretty good song though, the only redeeming factor here. Get Catalyst by NFG instead."
1,So fake,"I gave it one star...... this guy is lucky i gave himeven 1, he deseves -1,000 as far as i'm concernd. i really hate it when a band writes one 'good' song and they become stars. why? cuz of things like mtv. you'll notice you haven't heard of them much recently. cuz this is there only song that got popular"
1,"Yeah, it is ICKY!!!","This is a really bad cd. It was a waste of money to buy. The songs don't sound good and there is no originality AT ALL!!! Yeah, its bad. The songs sound the same, and they SUCK!!! Why do people like this cd?????!!! The right word would be ICKY!! thanks for that word!! enjoi."
1,Another 'reason' to dislike them,"When I first heard that song ""Reason"" I literally almost started laughing. Great line to open a song with ""I'm not a perfect person"", oh come on! Who do you think you are? Mariah Carey? Can you try being atleast a little more creative than that?I gave the album a try when a coworker lend it to me to hear it at work. I nearly skipped every song after 40 seconds because I couldn't bear anymore what these freaks had written. For some reason they mostly atract teenage kids that by wearing converse shoes they think they're punks or rockers. I hope their record contract expires soon or better yet removed.Don't waste your money nor time on this. It's very bad!"
4,emmm......,"i got this about a month ago and stuck it in my cd player, but i was suprised at what i was hearing...this isnt the hoobastank that i new and loved...im still deciding wether its good suprise or bad. i loved their other album that was brilliant but this...it just isnt as good, no where near as heavy as the last one and i tend to lean towards liking the heavy side of hoobastank or any band! i hope they dont sell out on their next album cause that will be a great shame and a big waste. id say to people who are looking for the heavy hoobastank go to their first album..although i think you should try it for yourself, dont let the reviews on here taint what you think..try it for yourself, i hope they go back to their heavy side for the next album! i think its nowere near as good as the last album, not even close and i still dont know if thats good or bad..."
2,Boring...,"I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this album, but what a let down! The songs are so one-dimensional, sometimes silly (""You make me feel luck as I can be"" repeated, for example). We hear about what they're feeling, but not why. The hit ""The Reason"" (which isn't ALL that great) remains the one, and only, highlight."
3,"Good effort, but ...","I like the band, but perhaps the songs aren't for me. I dunno. A good effort, good tunes, good melodies but... I dunno.But easily tolerated, quite a number of good songs in there, just missing something. I can't quite my finger on it. But whatever it is, this is for your consideration- or yours to put back on that music shop CD rack."
4,it's a good cd,"i think its a good cd but some songs are sssslllloooowwwww likethe song called reason. i thouht this was a rock band but some songs are to fast like out of contral, well you can tell that it's (out of contral).but some songs are pretty good like same dirction and one chance. i give lyricks 6/10 i give songs 5/10 and overall 7/10."
2,like most ppl,"okay these guys are okay but their hit single the reason got VERY badly overplayed by the radio. not only that if you had noticed their voices are computerized. they sound so bad live.just to tell you guys please if you like overplayed songs like the reason or you just happened to like it not matter how manys it got overplayed then be my guest. buy it if you want to. there songs sound all the same. but for others, don't buy it."
2,Docile...Tame....(cough) boring Rock,"This band is indistinguishable from any other band out there. It is not a particulary good listen, and the song Out of Control is just some guy screaming......I'm feeling out of control, out of control over and over again. If you like nickelback or default, you will like this album because for all I care, it could have been written by those bands. Hoobastank is just not good at expressing emotions.....if there are emotions.As a closing statement, i am not one of those people who go around pointing fingers at bands and saying sellout MtV radio played band yuck. This CD just sucks. And the reason it gets two stars is because i save the one star rating for the incredibly bad stuff. Dont buy it..."
3,i think they suffered on there sophomore effort...,"i really thought there first cd was amazing the day it came out but now 4 years later i really don't like hoobastank that much anymore. i will listen to them time to time but not as much as i did when there first cd was released. i think the reason is because of ""the reason"". i thought it was to poppy and the lyrics really aren't that great on this cd. i also give it 3 stars because of disappear i think its probably the best song on the cd, and i thought it was before it became on the radio. i hope there 3rd release is so much better or else i might just stay away from hoobastank altogether. i was also looking forwaard to seeing them in december and they said theyd come back in february but i dont think thats happening."
3,Not my cup a tea but nice,"I'm not a big fan of this album, but it is a nice sophomore album, Hoobastank seems really melo in this album, now in their first album, they had a great hit first single in Crawling In The Dark, but this album didn't start off too well with singles, going to Out Of Control, which is good, don't get me wrong but not really single material. The Reason single was good, great lighthearted song, Hoobastank does seem to get a little too melo at times but it's a great effort, and i think hardcore Hoobastank fans will enjoy."
5,Hoobastank RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have a question. How the hell coulds you hate this? It is awesome. It seems people don't know good music anymore. Everyone who gave this 5 stars is a normal music fan who can see a good band. With singles like Same Direction, Out of Control, and most of all, the hit single The Reason, you have gotta buy this awesome album. Can't wait for Hoobastanks next album."
3,RIDING HIGH WITH NO VISIBLE SUPPORT,"This CD is riding high on the charts and I can't say exactly why. It is a good and enjoyable CD; but so are a bunch of less popular records. The current hit single ""The Reason"" is OK. I like ""Out Of Control"" and ""Disappear"" much better. The band seems more surefooted on these two songs than on all the others. The playing seems a bit frenetic to me which usually is suspicious. Could mean they are disguising the quality of their musianship or the band is not all that confident in their songwriting. Seems to me they have nothing to worry about. Then again maybe they just like a frantic pace. I wish they would relax a bit."
3,Ehh..,"Now I admit. I was veryyy into the album when first listened to it. Second time through I realized that Hoobastank quite musically redundant and can't seem to find more to write about than ""finding the light"", ""guiding the way"", or simply being angry for someone for not guiding the way..Lyrics are very catchy although the songs are all pretty much the same but just arranged differently with wordings. I would say my favorite song on the whole album is ""The Reason"" diffenately draws away from other pieces. ultimately hoobastank is a pretense of Incubus and merely walks in the shadows of them. Lastly..the first album was much better.see you."
1,Could an album get any worse?,"I bet when you see the one-star rating I gave this album, you think that I must be biased against Hoobastank or something along those lines. Well, I'm not. I bought their first album, and I'll even admit to liking some of the songs on it. But this trash is just too rank for me to ignore. I believe that this album has three singles so far: ""Out of Control,"" ""The Reason,"" and ""Same Direction."" None of these songs are any good, and one of them (""The Reason"") makes my ears bleed whenever I'm forced to listen to it. OK, so that's an exaggeration, but this anger just builds up inside of me when I realize that this song actually gets air time on MTV, VH1, and radio stations. ""The Reason"" gets my vote for Worst Popular Music Song of All History. Boy bands have come out with better songs. There are only three words I have to say about Hoobastank's second album: crash and burn."
2,Pretty good,"I didn't like this CD as much as I liked the first one. I think the songs are all monotonous, and the only good ones are Out of Control and Same Direction."
3,hmmm first one was better,"hmmm well i went out and bought this cd on the first day, in hopes that it could live up to their first kick butt cd. Being a big fan of Hoobastank i was kinda disappointed. Don't get me wrong it is still a good cd, but they toned it way down. Anyways if you are looking to buy some hoobastank, my recommendations would be to buy their first cd."
2,"And The Winner For The ""Sophmore Slump Award"" Goes To...","HOOBASTANK and their Sophmore Album ""The Reason""...What The Hell Is This Crap Anyway? This is NOT the Hoobastank that gave us songs like ""Pick up the Pieces"" and ""Running Away"", it's a Hoobastank that has managed to bore us to death with their long awaited second release. I'll admit, ""Out Of Control"" was a pretty cool song before it got played out by radio, but almost every other song on here sucks. They all talk about the same boring subject over and over again, and the 12 tracks put it one step above ""The All American Rejects"" in snooze factor 5. This is NOT what alt. rock is about, at all, and anyone thinking about getting this album should Re-think that A.S.A.P...get ""catalist"" by NFG instead."
3,The Reason I bought this cd,I bought the cd for two reasons. 1. The Reason is an awesome song and 2. Doug is WAAAYYY hot! After listening two the whole cd I wasn't as impressed as I was with The Reason. Overall I think the cd is just ok. The cd is really relaxing though with a few high paced songs like Out of Control thrown in there. Hoobastank's new cd may just be ok but they are different then all the other bands out there and our doing their own thing and I'm not dissapointed I spent my money on it.
2,Bad Bad Bad,"I was at the store and had three CDs in my hand Hoobastank, Switchfoot and Nickleback, and for some reason I chose this one and I deeply regret it.I hate this CD, the only two good songs are 'The Reason' and 'Out of Control'. The CD is so repetitive, most of it sounds exactly the same. I was really disappointed."
5,Scotty's The Reason Review,I've listened to alot of Hoobastank and am a big fan So far this si theor best CD in my opinion. If you are looking for some good music to just sit back and listen to this is what you want. Don't skip a song on here because they get better and better as you get farther into the song. This CD rocks and I'm looking forward to Hoobastank's next CD.
1,HoobaSTINK,"How can anyone take Hoobastank seriously? What kind of name is Hoobastank? Fist I have to say this: They suck! ""The Reason"" they suck is this: These people cannot sing worth crap. People like Hoobastank should have never been handed a microphone. Their songs were overplayed. Which is about every single one of them. So why waste money when you can STILL hear them on the radio. The songs sound the same but with different lyrics. The things they talk about are retarded, just like this band and CD. I Bought the CD before they were on the radio, thinking they were pretty good, because a friend told me about them. So when I got home I listened to the CD, and wen to hide it. I just recently found it. I listened to about 4 minutes of the CD and realized why it was hidden, THIS CD SUCKS! And then I snapped the CD in half. If you own the CD, hear is some advice: snap it in half."
1,jajajaj,"man i haje this song, everytyme i her it at work i want to take whwerver i have in my hand (tea urn, s calding hot oil) and pour it all voermyslef and ingternallyu combusto so my ears won't have to put up with any more tarnishings...radio airplay sucks the llamas/donkeys assrock over londone, rockon chicago"
2,hoobastank need i say anymore,"you can see by the name that this band is aother coporate creation to the masses of 10 year old girls tryin' to be hipand weepin' at the sickly lyrics of ""the reason"" god when i first heard that song i cried..not because it's a beautiful poetic song with passion and superb word-play it's because it made me nauseous i was ready to spill my guts on the breakfast i'd just ateare these guys tryin' to be hip or are just marketted to sellbuckle loads of records to the mtv for the price of the decency of rock and rolli one know it's the secondthere name hooba-stank is a double edged sword becausewhen music fans see the name and cd on their local cd storesthey think ""well they've got to be good because they've got stank in their name and any band they purposely puts stank in their name is gonna be bad right?"" WRONGyet if you like it then that's okay we all have different tastes in music and that's what makes un indivudual..."
1,another loser band,"Hooba...stank...stinks and will always stink. I don't know about the rest of the CD, but listening to The Reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal. I'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn. Egad!"
1,bands today...,"please don't even get me started i teach preschool and i know kids who can write better lyrics than this stupid....well i can say...music really has changed and in a really bad direction...i found a reason for me to change who i used to be...and if u think that is bad it keeps going on...a reason to start over new and the reason is u...yeh i'm about to puke too...compare that to:I know someday you'll have a beautiful life.I hope you'll be a star in somebody else's sky but why, why, why can't it be, can't it be mine?please don't buy this cd...if u do u have just closed what was left of good music....might i recommend pearl jam's TEN or VS. anything really, but NOT this....don't listen to the people who say it is good music u will strongly regret it.."
1,More Pathetic MTV Rock,"Hoobastank sucks. They're on MTV's TRL and VH1 way too much. No talent, no guts, no acception whatsoever, man they're such a laugh. You want real music, listen to Slayer, Pantera, Chimaira, Killswitch Engage, Deicide, Shadows Fall, Kreator, Death, Sepultura, Metallica, Hatebreed, Lamb Of God, Superjoint Ritual, Cannibal Corpse, Fear Factory, Soilwork, Cradle Of Filth, King Diamond, In Flames, and Machine Head. Said enough, I'm through."
1,my ears...,"i listened to this album and it's horrible crap...like someone kindly pointed out to me;if you took nick lachey and tied him to a chair and tortured him and made him sing a crappy unoriginal love song, ""THE REASON"", by Hoobastank would be just that...and the rest of the album is blatantly ripping off other bands."
1,Typical New Rock Garbage,"This album right here is a perfect example of the majority of rock music that is put out today. This band dosen't seem motivated to make creative music at all, they are just simply riding the crybaby rock wave. Though this isn't as horrible as pop punk and emo, it is still very bad. When the lead ""singer"" starts to whine around saying,""i'm not a perfect person..."", it sounds like he's crying to his mother after he spilled milk all over the table. I don't understand why people like listening to this ""feel sorry for me because my girlfriend left me"" garbage. I mean, it's okay to write love songs and songs about relationships, but please sing, don't whine! This band, as well as pop punk/emo bands are nothing more than N Sync or The Backstreet Boys with instruments. Don't waste your time on this garbage, go find some good music."
2,Not worth the $$$,"I have to admit I actually liked ""The Reason"" and I still do. So I decided to buy the album and well, to put it plainly I thought it, Hooba-STANK. All of the songs sounded basically the same, except maybe 2, and they were all about trouble in relationships. You know, I start to not care about this relationship after hearing about it for 50 minutes. Something horrible must have happended to the people of Hoobastank to make them right so many songs about the same thing. So if you want my advice, just download ""The Reason,"" but don't waste your money on this CD."
1,hoobastank more like hoobasuxs!!,they are horrible they don't know how to sing did anyone watch the on mtv's VMA's cuz if you think they sang good WELL they didn't that sucked!! they had to have the audience sing the high notes cuz they couldn't sing it!!! omg i am telling you don not waste your money on this they are fake!!!
5,Great new album!,"I am a big fan of this band and know their first entire CD off by heart. Anyone who I have ever told to listen to Hoobastank has come away loving them. Needless to say I rushed to the stores to buy The Reason the day it came out and was ecstatic to finally get a chance to listen to it. Although their first CD was definitely a classic, I recommend this album to all those who love their first album and to anyone who loves to listen to a refreshing new sound. (plus the guys in this band are awesome!)"
5,The Reason to buy this C.D. is because it's great,"Although I completely don't get the band's name, I sure do get their music. I'm a fan of hard guitars, and on this album Hoobastank has them generating all sorts of appealing melodies. The instrumental backing is somewhat like Linkin Park in some tracks, and the vocals are slightly similar-sounding to Simple Plan, yet a bit less sneery. The music on this album is very exciting, for the forceful beats easily invite you into Hoobastank's musical experience and the vocals are fairly meaningful and intriguing. The track I would most recommend on this album is Same Direction, which discusses an interesting topic while blasting electric guitars and providing delightful lyrical patterns. I would without a doubt recommend this C.D., especially to rock fans and fans of Hoobastank's first album.I recommend:Same DirectionOut of ControlEscapeJust OneThe ReasonLet It OutNever ThereDisappear"
2,great?,"The reason is a pretty good song.But honestly, the rest of cd is pure crap!Each song sounds the same, I dont't like the lyrics too.I0ll give two stars only because I like the reason.and more, the singer can't even take a tune live!"
1,*head explodes*,"This album is so bad. SO bad. I cannot emphasize how bad it is, 1 star does not show just how low a score this music deserves. First of all, and most importantly, whoever gave Douglas Robb a pen and pad deserves to be slapped a lot. Second, The Reason is one of the most annoying things ever, giving Paris Hilton's saying of ""that's hot"" a run for its internet porn money.Ranting aside, there are a bunch of reasons why this is a bad album. The lyrics are why emo has such a bad name. You can't write about arbitary ""confusion"" or ""anger"" and suddenly be deep. You need a reason, and it can't just be ""youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"" (sorry for the pun). Also, the music itself is just ugh-blech. Nothing creative here, but what else is new.If you're looking for adolescent-grade music and find innovation in repeated piano stabs, get this."
2,"Wow, this CD is very bad.","I won't say that they sold out, not at all, but they changed their style very much from the previous record, might be some sort of maturation process who knows.In short, this CD is not worth buying. The only 3 good songs on this CD are Same direction, The Reason, and Unaffected. That's it. Nothing more. I know what you're thinking, no don't listen to it. Instead if you have to have some of the songs download them for 99 cents each. The music in most of these songs is just goddamn awful (sorry for the politically incorrect word). The guitar riffs and the melodies are just crappy.I admit that Hoobastank is a talented band, but with this showing they took a step back. I hope they rebound quickly and fairly well.That's my two cents."
3,it was good... for a while,"i absolutley loved the song ""the reason"" and was exited everytime it came on the radio. (about 50 times.)But it becomes Very annoying after a while. So, i think this would be an ok.cd. at least for someone who does not get annoyed easily."
3,not much yet enough,"This cd would be a 7 on my list..It is an improvement from the last but it still not nearly as good as 311's cd Evolver, or Linkin Parks' meteora...Just compare the guitar riffs and drum beats and then say 'blah' and youll know what i mean...i also like bands like Chevelle, 311, Trust Company, Sublime, Linkin Park, and Korn, and even Marilyn Manson (his newest cd is by far the best)."
4,INCREDIBLE,"This group is one of my favorites. The song ""reason"" is great and has a cool video. It is getting more radio play more now then back in December. You gotta buy this cd. The song ""Out of Control"" is out of control. Vocals are awesome on every track. Go buy it now."
1,Sell Outs,"I bought their first cd and thought it was alright. when the second one came out i was hesitant on getting it. (I had only heard ""out of control"", this is before that piece of trash ""the reason"" came out). but i got a best buy gift card for christmas so i thought screw it, i'll get it. wow did i waste some money off my card. its wayyyy slower. ""out of control"" was very misleading because the rest of the cd is a bunch of wussy songs you listen to if your 12 and your girlfriend of a week dumped you. the song ""the reason"" is a borefest that is overplayed on every channel and radio station. even MTV plays it a lot and i didnt know they still played music videos anymore."
1,"I liked Hilary Duff's version of ""The Reason"" much better","What, you say Hilary didn't do this song? You have got to be kidding me! I could swear this is a Hilary Duff song. Sure sounds like Hilary stuff to me. Has anyone else seen Hobbestank's hilarious video for ""The Reason?"" This video is the funniest I've seen in a long time and is almost as good as ""Queer Eye For The Straight Guy"" or ""The Kids In The Hall."""
2,"Not the Best, Not the Worst","I admit that I bought this album b/c I liked ""The Reason."" The rest of the album is mediocre at best. Every song sounds the same. There is maybe two other songs on this compilation that are likeable and even that is a stretch.I wouldn't give up on Hoobastank, but this album is pretty bad. It's one-hit-wonderish. Save your money and download ""The Reason"" off the internet."
4,This CD is OUT OF CONTROL!,"After I heard ""The Reason"" I wanted to hear more of Hoobastank becuase ""The Reason"" was an awesome song! After I heard more I liked it and wanted it. Turns out the CD is one of the best I own and listen to it frequently. The only reason why I give the CD a 4 is becuase the songs sorta sound the same. But if your smart you will buy the CD!"
4,Not Bad!,"I have to say that I enjoyed the first album more than this one. The first album had more songs that you could rock out to, and a majority of the songs on here are more mellow. I did, however, enjoy this album a lot. The best songs are ""Escape"" ""The Reason"", and ""Disappear"". If you like Hoobastank, you should get this."
2,dreary,"having heard the song, The Reason, on the radio, there is no way I would buy this cd. The song is so DREARY! Monotone, I do not like it at all, in fact, I turn down the radio when it comes on. It is currently being overplayed on my radio station, which makes it even worse!"
1,"You must be a Jaken, doomed to be Sesshoumaru's slave!","Wow, when I saw that this cd was 4 stars, my eyeballs just about pooped out of my head! I mean come on, what kind of crazy monsters are living in this world?! If you like this cd, then you're a Jaken!(If you don't know what it means, then look it up)"
2,the reason this sucks wannabe pop,i loved there first cd so lets try to get off trl and move to headbangers ball.
3,"Good music, but lyrics need help","The musical aspect of the CD is great, its just that the lyrics written to the music are what I call ""8th grade anthems""....the songs are for the most part immature and infantile. Other than that, The Reason is really good and it is obvious that Hoobastank have alot of musical talent....p.s. nobody in Hoobastank is related to anyone in Incubus"
3,Hoobastank - The Reason (3.5 outa 5),"Hoob's new cd is nothing special. It's not bad though. I do like it. It's just not much of an improvement at all to me. I really like their song 'Out of Control' and absolutely love the lyrics and melody of 'The Reason'. 'Out of Control' doesn't really sound like a song that Hoobastank would do, but I friggin love it..lol. Most of the other songs on the cd so far haven't done much for me, but like I said..they aren't bad..nor are they that good. This is definetly a dl'r."
4,WHOA,"I had no idea how good this cd was going to be! I had absolutely no expectations for it, besides the fact that I thought it would suck. Man was I wrong!! Hoobastank completely SHATTERS the notion that they are Incubus clones and come out with an incredibly enjoyable sophmore release. An Artists second cds are notoriously the worst but hey, this completely blows their mediocre s/t out of the water! Standout tracks: Out of Control, Escape, Just One, and my favorite, Let It Out. Buy this one. By the way, Doug Robb can't really scream the way he does on a few of the songs, its studio sh*t, but I heard they're really good live anyway."
1,Huh?,"""I'm not a perfect person""?? If there's an award for the most inane lyric of all time, this has got to be the winner.Not only is it stupid, but it's whiney. Oh, and the tune is really monotonous. Why is this song so popular? It was in heavy rotation four years ago, and I just heard the damned thing on the radio again yesterday. I'm guessing it's because of aggressive marketing, particularly on MTV."
2,Big disappointment,"Their first cd remained on my playlist for quite a while. You really can't ask for much better in a first effort, but this album is just tripe. I'm frankly shocked that so many people appear to like it (based on the reviews here). I won't have such high expectations for a third album."
2,No wear near other album...,"WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT! Hoobastank (self titled) was soo good! crawling in the dark was on of my favorite songs at a time, but this new cd is very boring just look at the cover i mean common what is that?? and its not the hoobastank i fell inlove with.. so i had to move on with my life.. but seriously I could not listen to that cd for long at all, i just gave it to my cousin and i think she gave it to her friend.. the song ""the reason"" is soo bad, it was plaied out on the radio so I hope they go back to their old ways in a new album.. HOPEFULLY!"
3,why?,because theres only a couple good songs and only one semi-hard song. these guys r good but they can do better than this. i just dont like the softness of this album. ya kno maybe there next cd will be good or great or watever but this just aint a great cd. i like this cd but not as much as others. if this cd is like 12 bucks or lower than its a better deal. i payed 15 and i dont feel it was worth it. but like i said if its lower than 12 pick it up.
5,This cd's pretty cool,"This cd is pretty bad. The lead singer can actually sing and the band has some good skill. Altough I don't really agree with lead singer's philosophy on th efirst track, the song does sound cool. I especially like the second track, it sounds cool, I can kind of relate with it, and it was the song that got me interested in them at first. Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,ThE ReAsOn why its the best...,"I had bought this album on saturday 13th December as I couldnt get into town on tuesday , but it was something worth waiting for! I have listened to this album over 20 times since saturday and just cant get the songs out of my head! Hoobastank are amazing!Peace xXx"
5,SHINING STARS IN A SEA OF NOTHING! A++,"Hoobastank has proved themselves once again. Everytime I listen to it I dont even need to hit the next button. Every song is solid and the cd is a great experience. The sound they produce and the lyrics are far superior than that of their self titled album and of any album I have purchased recently. If your debating whether or not to pick this up, dont debate, just get it."
5,Great Album,"I picked this cd up the release day knowing that it wouldn't disappoint. It sounds very much like the self-title album, which i absolutely loved. My only gripe is, like their previous albums, it is too short. I recommend The Reason to all Hoobastank fans, you will not be let down."
2,Doesn't bring much to the table,"Why people like the song The Reason is beyond me, this band can't find one song that any hard rock would like, The album does no better, songs like Out Of Control, and Same Direction are poorly sung and cheesy lyrics swamp some great tunes they could of had. This cd gets an extra star because i feel generous today, but if they want to become popular, they should quit then they would be popular."
1,"If i could give a smell to this album, its rotten fish","NO. this album is teh suck.1+1=22+2=4Hoobostank+my house= black eyeplease, do not buy this album. Get your ideas straight and give yourself a more usefully spent time listening to real music."
2,I hate these kinds of bands...,"...that come into the rock scene with one blisteringly painful repetitive riff that copies throughout the whole song.i guess its what people like though, so i give them a star credit for tricking the world and luering the rock scene into a hole of empty three chord riffs.take it from a guitar player's point of view, its not worth it, the songs may be catchy but they get old and nothing mixes it up . . . (...)believe me , this cd will get old fast and you'll be looking on to another cd to buy,when you finally find out wut i'm saying is true and look into more complex music, you'll be a true rocker... but 'til then,*enjoy hoobastank!*"
1,Rather have a route canal,"Ok, I haven't heard all of their stuff, but if it is anywhere near the pain and anguish of ""The Reason"" I think I might just listen to Vanilla Ice. I work at Baskin Robbins and hear that song atleast three times a day, and everytime it comes on I want to go lock myself in the freezer. Besides the fact that the lyrics are the worst I have ever heard, the song isn't even cool. I cannot picture anyone actually enjoying this crap. I think I'll take my chances with Aaron Carter, or the Backstreet Boys, atleast they know they're dumbasses. Someone should just put them out o f their misery"
5,This Is For Zyke ...Music Hater,Well looking at Zyke's reviews looks like he had a busy day March 10.Dude i bet you havent heard any of these songs.You just on the hatin bandwagon.Just like everybody else is about music.Next time buy the cd before you review it.Or borrow it or something.If not don't bother reviewing music on here again.You are a waste of space.
3,Okay...,"This is my first review ever... but I just wanted to comment on one song -- Out of Control. I can't understand for the life of me why *everyone* likes this song. I think the part where he whines/screams ""out of control"" is soooooo annoying. Someone please explain... how can you like that?As for the rest of the cd, it actually sounds pretty good... I'll give it a 3.5."
1,Hoobastinks,"Hoobastank's The Reason is a bad album in an era of bad music. In the past two years about a million bands with corny little tunes are bieng stuffed in our ears. Here is Hoobastank not the worst of em' all but thats not saying much. if You herd the single ""Reason"" and like it you wont find anything else on LP as catchy. Hoobastank's The Reason is just another example of crap bieng packaged and sold as a ""ROCK"" album. Look Rock music died along time ago, now all we have are boy bands with guitars. D+"
2,What a disappointment after such a good debut album!,"Seriously, could there possibly be a more obnoxious, irritating, whiny song than ""The Reason."" Girls that think this song is the sweetest thing ever obviously haven't actually paid attention to the lyrics. Hoobastank's first album stayed in my CD player quite a bit--this one doesn't stand a chance. Simply horrible, over-produced, over-commercialized, cheesy pop music in the vein of avril or ashley, barely hidden behind ""manly"" vocals and hard rock guitar and bass-now that I think of it, kind of like Creed. Yuck. Truly sad. They only get 2 stars because the first album was so good. If this album had been their first, it would be in the $2 bargain bin, mixed in with Vanilla Ice, William Hung, and John Tesch. Do yourself a favor, and stay away."
4,Hoobastank rocked way before,"For all of you new 2 Hoobastank you are missing a really good cd, If you dont own their indy cd ""they sure don't make basketsball shorts like they used to"" this has to be hoobastanks best cd. You can find it on e-bay or download it on Kazaa-lite. A must have for any hoobastank fan. The Reason and the self titled disc are both great but check it out it rocks."
5,Whoa...,"I've got Hoobastank's self titled... it kept me satisfied for a few months... now, there's only about 4 tracks worth hearing. Something tells me I'm not going to tire of ""The Reason"" so quickly. Everyone can relate to standing at crossroads in their lives, feeling like they don't measure up, and of course, the trials of love. This CD rocks from start to...well... almost finish... ""Disappear"" was a weak track to end it with. But hey, nobody's perfect. And wow! The songs actually sound DIFFERENT from one another!! You don't get that much anymore! Standout tracks: ""Same Direction"", ""Out of Control"", ""Unaffected"" and ""Never There"". Perfect for all kinds, whether you just hate the bubble gum pop crap or you're no ""wanksta"" [don't even get me started on the joke they call ""Fiddy Cent""] , or if you're just a fan of rock. If you don't believe me, get off your duff and go preview it at your local music store. I bet you'll walk out wirh it."
1,Just Plain Sucks,"The first cd was ok, not good, just ok. This one is a crybaby sell out cd. How on Earth do people compare them to Incubus? Incubus is original, and talented, and their songs sound, oh whats the word...DIFFERENT!! Worst song is ""The Reason"". It's overplayed MTV garbage, do you notice that all the teeny boppers who write good reviews say their favorite song is ""The Reason"", it's because MTV says it's awesome. You've all been brain washed! HOOBASTANK IS A BUNCH OF SELL OUTS!!!"
4,A GOOD DIGGER,"I purchased this tiller from Amazon a while back and used it numerous times for small areas that I needed to dig up. Works well for such a small tiller, but does the job fairly well. Don't expect to dig to China it won't do it, but its good for small areas where a depth of a few inches (4 or 5) is what you want. Mine still works well and I have had no repairs."
4,Electric Mantis Tiller/Kickstand,"First of all, I've had Mantis' products over the years and loved them. The tine detangler can't be beat. And I LOVE my electric tiller/cultivator.The kickstand is another story! I was excited when I purchased my new tiller w/this addition. It is hard to put together (because of the tight space) and even harder to get it lined up to work properly. I've actually turned the tiller over, trying to get the kickstand down. I would not purchase it again."
5,OUTSTANDING,I purchased this with the hope of eliminating the neighborhood kid I had taking 6 hours to plant 4 plants @ $10.00/hr. He wanted $15!! I received the tiller and watched the dvd (a must) and put it together - not hard to do if you watch the dvd. Took me about 20 minutes to put together. Then I realized I didn't put on the kick stand yet but that was easy too and the kick stand is a great asset!! Had the tiller outside within an hour! I was a bit worried that it wouldn't perform as it did in the videos online but I was proven wrong real fast! The tiller tore into the ground with ease and I had perfect planting soil in no time. It's 20lb. weight allows even me to use and I have a bad back. And it is quiet as stated. My nosey neighbor had no clue I was working outside until he saw me!! No more neighborhood kid ripping me off! I do it myself with my mantis tiller!! I do think they should include the Tine Detangler with the tiller. I highly recommend this product.
4,Worked great until it broke,"It worked great until it broke. Easy to use electric tiller; quiet, powerful, relatively easy to handel. When tilling soil with a lot of roots it will stop itself and the GFI will pop. Clear the tines, push in the reset button and off you go. Well, after about 20 hours or so of use the tines stopped again in roots and the switch popped. I cleared the tines, pushed in the button and nothing but a ""click"" when I tried to start it again. The story is not over, as I called the service line. I was given three possible local repair shops. The first didn't service the electric model. The second was out of business, and the third, which is about 8 miles from my home, said ""no problem"", just bring it in between 8 am and 5 pm, show proof of purchase date and they will fix it. So, we will see how it goes. I am hopeful because the time and effort this little marvel saved me is well worth a little time to get it fixed."
4,Great tiller if you have electricity where you need it.,"I have had a Troy, a gas Mantis, a small Honda tiller, and now the electric Mantis. The electric works surprisingly well. It does tangle with long grass or weeds but the tines come off easier than my gas Mantis.Breaks up soil quite well. When you hit a rock, just let off the trigger and remove the rock. Starting is just pulling the trigger rather than restarting a gas engine. Big plus. Once you get the rocks out, smooth tilling. When I say rock, I'm talking about fist or bigger rocks. They can jam the tiller. When the this happens, circuit breaker blows. Easy reset after removal.This is not a replacement for a big tiller but does fine on small areas.Allows easy cultivation. Great for raised beds. Use a weedeater or lawnmower before the tiller for the grass & weeds.Very glad I got this."
5,Almost perfect,Works as advertized. Seems to be of very high quality. Minor quibbles: My 12 GA extension cord doesen't fit the built-in cord holder. I wish it came standard with the inti-weed bushings for the tines.ChuckS
5,Mantis tiller,WOW....this little guy sure is a work horse. At first I had some reservations buying an elettric tiller. I am glad I did. The instructions were easy to follow (just read them and have all the parts laid out in front of you). I also purchased the recommned items and they sure help.
4,The Thines did not have holes so that it can be attached to the shaft,The Thines did not have holes so that it can be attached to the shaft. I had extra expense sending them back to MantisVery unhappy with the extra expenses and the delay in being able to use the equipment.
5,electric mantis tiller - the answer for organic living,"Excellent Product. The Electric Mantis Tiller is the answer for Organic backyard gardening. So quiet yet so efficient you wonder why you ever used anything else! Recommend everyone buying only this product, As powerful as any gas mini tiller and my whole family enjoys using it. Life is a Garden go out and Dig it!"
1,garbage,Quit after two months and less than 30 minutes service life. Runs momentarily after trigger is pulled and then stops. Repeats indefinitely. Mantis says ship it to PA (from AZ?). I'm not that rich.Mantis need to start making these in China.
3,Handy to have,"This tiller is very light weight,quiet and easy to use. This is perfect for sandy soils and loams. Not so good on compacted clay. The kickstand has been a nice addition. Tines come off easily for cleaning. Love not having to store gas anymore."
2,Build Quality Suspect,"The video on the manufacturer's web site made it look like the Mantis electric could move mountains with easeMantis 120-Volt Electric Tiller/Cultivator with Border Edger and Kickstand #7250-15-02. I purchased it to rip up my existing grass lawn with the intention of reseeding from scratch. Easier said than done. The effort was tough,exhausting and ultimately not worth it. It's too light weight for this task and probably better at moving a mole hill than a mountain.Also, halfway through the task, the pin holding one of the wheels just flew off! It took nearly an hour of sifting through the dirt to find it.I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon. Their return policy makes it easy; went online and arranged for UPS to pick it up at my house at no charge. Amazon has just issued me a credit."
2,it worked well until...,"I bought the electric unit new and assembled. When I first used it I was very impressed with the performance of this small machine. Unfortunately, after the first year and about the fifth use the electric switch refused to work. I opened the switch casing and little plastic parts fell out. The parts were broken and seemed feeble. The next disapointment came when I tried to find someone locally to fix it. There was one shop 25 miles away that would work on it but their reputation according to several online ratings was not stellar. So now it sits in the basement."
3,Didn't break much ground...,"My wife and I are starting a new garden and were looking to till up a portion of our yard to prepare for planting. I liked the reviews for the Mantis, so I decided to check it out. Not sure if I was using for something it's not designed for, but for me it just couldn't get the job done. Basically, instead of really digging into the ground, it spent a lot of time bouncing up and down off the grass and soil, unable to penetrate in. I called it the psychotic rabbit. Maybe you are only supposed to use it on cultivated soil, but for me that defeats the purpose. once the soil is softer and conditioned it seemed like it would work fine, but I decided to get a walk behind tiller to really dig things up.So, if you've got tough soil and sod that you want to tear up, I'd look elsewhere."
5,What a great product,"I reluctantly purchased the electric version, because of issues with small gas engines over time. I'm very happy I did. I've used both and the electric version is much better, quiet and powerful. My only concern is running over the cord, which I already did, once. Luckly the motor stops instantly, saving the cord from damage."
4,makes a difference,"My hair were very thin and I was loosing my hair too, but with this conditioner my hair got more healthier and strong. Give atleasst 30 days to see the results. love this product"
3,Love or Money,"This book talk about a romence, Aurelia got maried to Seixas after she got rich. She wants to see if he loves her or not, because she was poor in the past and he didn`t get married to her when she was poor. I do not recommend it because this book is a little slow."
2,Good if you're new,"Pretty pictures and inspiring colorways, to be true. It's a small book and the patterns are all scarves and bags (I think, without looking back). No garments. Aimed at a very beginning knitting and very encouraging to someone who is just starting out.One of the project pictures gave me the idea to try knitting dead pantyhose. Still need to test that.Net: One good idea harvested. Glad it was in the library."
3,It Works if you Move Beyond Author's Presentation,"This book is great for beginners and those that feel challenged by color and texture. While I am not interested in everything that was presented (no interest in making rugs), there are plenty of ideas for bags and scarves and even an afghan. I think as one reviewer put it, many of her projects look homemade instead of handmade but... start exploring different types of yarns and see what you can come up with. For instance, instead of fabric try ribbon yarn or textured bulky or super bulky yarns, juste or materials along that line for the projects presented. You can also step it up when it comes to the hardware and embellishments used. Vary the needle sizes within your scarf pattern--don't get stuck. I am planning on using this book in conjunction with several other books on textured designs and color. I would buy this book used. Good luck!"
5,I think this is a great book!,"This is a great book for beginners (like myself) who have already mastered the garter stitch. The projects for the bags are very clear. Being a beginner though some of the abbreviations can be confusing, but they are very easy to figure out once you look at them again. You can always look up what the mean online or in another knitting book."
2,Very disappointing,"As someone working actively in the field of phytotherapies, I was extremely disappointed when this bbok landed on my desk by our research library - a waste of budget to say the least. The depth of each plant reviewed is on the whole well done, however, Europe as a land mass let alone a group of exciting people, does not appear to exist for this FDA author. The introductory preface clearly identifies that the author is not in tune with real global herbal medicine. Only 27 plants are reviewed, and the choice is bizzare and incoherent. Don't bother with it - there are far better books available!"
2,Typical Bollywood Bloat,"A rags-to-riches cautionary tale straight off the Bollywood assembly-line, ""London Dreams"" is a lengthy, superficial account of an orphaned Indian émigré who finds that life as a rising British pop star isn't all it's cracked up to be.This cliché-ridden film pads out its interminable two-and-a-half-hours-plus running time with overheated melodrama, soul-searing angst, bloated musical numbers, and cutesy slapstick routines. And, of course, it's overflowing with that kind of self-congratulatory smugness that seems to be the hallmark of so many of the commercial films coming out of India these days.The movie does take us to many colorful London locales - befitting a wide-eyed tourist from abroad - but one could get pretty much the same effect using Google street view and not have to put up with all the drama."
3,Could Have Been Better,"Vipul Shah once again returns with his uniform Punjabi flavour & the India-London theme. Taking another step ahead of his ""Namaste London"", this time he impressively comes up with a good take on pop singers and the back stage drama in their over famous lives. But in an otherwise well directed, intense and emotional drama, he is sadly not accompanied by an equally enjoyable musical score (as in Namaste London), which was much needed by the subject and its script. So minus the songs and uninspiring music, here we have a well directed movie with some entertaining & enlightening moments and a worth watching climax."
5,"Great price, super quality. Best of all, super fast shipping",I got the product next day. Fast shipping. Will buy again.
3,"Very basic, but what can you expect for the money?","I haven't used other induction cooktops, so I don't have a lot to compare to, but I know that others have far more control over heat. The main drawbacks I've found are:1. The lowest power level is still pretty high. Even with good pans, I found sauces burning if not stirred constantly, and it wasn't possible to simmer.2. Only 5 power levels doesn't give a huge amount of variation.3. There is clearly a ring where the magnetic current operates, so you need a really good pan to diffuse the heat for you.4. The included pan is worthless, other than to see how quickly water will boil."
4,Very nice,"I'm a player of 10 years, and this was my first time playing Irish/Celtic music. The song selections are great and the accompanying CD brings them to life. I found the notation a little bland, but I added my own ornaments here and there and it sounded very nice. There are several songs on the CD that don't have any accompaniment (guitar), and that was a little bit of a bummer.I definitely recommend!"
3,Chess Set and Book together for Beginners,"Actually, for a starters chess set for someone who might not get into chess seriously (by joining the school chess club) the chess set is ok. My pieces did not crack, but I only used them a short time before getting a regular tournament design chess set and roll board for playing at the school chess club.The book is not so bad if once again if you are not sure if you are going to get very involved in chess. If you think you are then the book is not very deep and you will outgrow it very fast after reading it. If you think you might be joining your school chess club look at the ""Chess complete guide for the beginner"" or ""Learn Chess"" by Alexander for a book that will take you deeper into the strategies.But, this set and board is a bargin if you are a kid who does not really want to get into chess deeply or be involved in the school club or any tournaments."
2,Two of the pieces got cracks after about a year,"I wanted to let you know that on the rook and the king they formed cracks on them after I used the set for about a year (played about one time a week with it). The book is fine, but the set was made well enough to last. Time to get a new set!"
5,Let's get this back in print!,"The reader comments below are on-target, especially the one from North Dakota. I found this book at a local bookstore, sale priced with a plastic chess set and board. My 8 year old son took an immediate interest, and was fascinated with setting up the strategies described in the book with aid of the set. This book not only instructs well, it has the equally important quality of inspiring interest to learn the game. I do hope the publisher will bring it out in another printing if it is currently out of print. Kids deserve this kind of reading!"
4,"Does the job, just ask my 6 year old.","Could not think of a better treatment of the subject for a child's introduction to the game. These folks provided the text and pictures to not only show the fundamentals of game but to bring it alive in the mind much like ""Knight & Castle play"" in the back yard.Haven't done a big analysis of all the available materials for chess instruction...BUT this book, some parent time, and a chess computer program FIRMLY entrenched the basics of this game in my 6 year old's brain.TO THE AUTHOR: Would benefit from more ""example games"" in the next version but be sure to keep up the adventuresome ""story line"". Would also be great if you would package a basic computer program, following the book's tutoring and pictures, with the ability to exercise the student in piece moves and actual play."
5,beginner's chess set,"This is an awesome beginner's chess set. My 3rd grade son read the book by himself, and then asked me to play with him. I thought I would have to guide him through, but he actually corrected an error I made!!! The board has each piece pictured along with directional arrows and a note telling you when the piece is able to capture. This set allows a younger child to play a game traditionally for teens and adults. I highly recommend this set to any adult or child wanting to learn to play chess."
2,Disjoint and superficial,"I worked at one of the companies mentioned in the book and worked with or knew several of the characters personally. A co-worker actually turned me onto the book after she recognized my old company's name mentioned. I borrowed it and proceeded to catch up with what happened to these folks for the few years after Worldesign shut down.While the few facts I can personally relate to are accurate, they do focus a great deal on emotion and bitterness and seem to take one person's accounts as gospel without balance from others. It does state many of the hidden trials of startups.The writing style is weak. I found the plot disjoint and with too much coverage in some areas, and mostly too little development/depth in others. If I were to have read the book without personal knowledge of the people mentioned, I would have screamed for more character development.I agree with the other reviewer that this is something you borrow from the library. It was a quick read."
1,Pure dreck,"If there's one thing the HIT Lab is REALLY good at, it's hyperbole and self-promotional BS (ok, two things!) There is excellent work going on in the world of VR, but you'll have to go elsewhere to read about it. Why was this book written??"
2,Digital Greedbags,"This book is not badly written - I wouldn't say it's well written by any means but it's not bad. The thing that really galls one about the book are the characters - and unfortunately they're not fictitious. I hit rock bottom with the cast when I read about one ""dreamer"" who when presented with an opportunity to contribute a technological innovation to oceanographic research responded with the gushing realization that he could ""make millions."" Not that he might contribute something to humanity - but he might ""make millions."" It's a little hard to picture people primarily driven by a desire for money as ""dreamers."" Maybe the book should have been subtitled ""The Digital Greedbags who are Hyping VR to Death.""If the point of the book is to lampoon the crass nature of the people in Seattle working on VR, it succeeds admirably. Somehow, however, I don't think that was intended to be the point. Read it only if you have a strong stomach for brainless greed, hype, and outright BS."
1,Soap Opera's are more realistic!!,"It would be great drama if it weren't for the fact that it's melodrama. Who could possibly believe such two dimensional characters rendered in vivid black and white? It's not even credible on the face of it let alone in the fact. In Moody's rush to lionize Furness and the HITL engineers and to enhance drama he leaves anything approaching objectivity completely aside. The immaturity of Furness and his mignons shows through in their ""sour grapes"" whining commentary which is full of expletives and extremes. Just another ""visionary/engineer as victim"" hack job, complete with poor fact finding and even a few completely fabricated events thrown in for good measure. A conspicuous lack of commentary from any of the business people who are so consistently slandered. Could have been an interesting story but..."
1,disappointing,"I had enjoyed Fred Moody's last book and was looking forward to this one, but it was basically a lot of labored hype and lacked substance. He seemed more interested in coming across as ""hip and happenin'"" by doing detailed descriptions of such passé things as people's nipple rings, tattoos and irrelevant run-ins with pop celebrities than exploring the subject."
3,"Useful, but too centered on one group","Overall, quite good. The characterization of Furness seems correct. But the place of the ""HIT lab"" in VR history is grossly overstated. The original system at VPL, the Autodesk and Sense8 work, and the commercial W Industries system are barely mentioned. Still, any business book that ends with a bankruptcy auction can't be all bad."
3,Not what I was looking for.,This is a tough one to review. As a map light it is a poor choice. The light is a square of red light with A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE. That is right. The light is a chiclet like square of red light with a large dark hole in the middle. The only reason it isn't one star is that i think the entire thing is really an emergency beacon. The slow flash and faster flashing sequence work and are very bright. But even with the fiber optic wand the light at the end is not a uniform pattern and is a poor choice to read by. I think it is nice in an emergency to attract attention. But i wanted a map light that was red and small in weight and the light is just too weird in pattern to be acceptable.
4,Likin' the Ninjas!,"This is actually for our son's 6th birthday, later this Summer. It isn't ""educational"" in the sense that it teaches him anything, but it does foster imagination and creative play, which we feel is important. We bought him all 4 Ninjas at a super price, thinking that we could interact with him or there would be enough for 3 friends to play with him as well. They also seem sturdy enough to ""play"" outside in the backyard on the big playset (swings, slides, rockwall, club house...) this Summer, but I'll have to ammend my review if they fall apart or something!"
2,This vise is really small,"I bought this for my workbench and it is way too small. The width is as advertised but the jaw opening is too small (I think 4 inches). After putting 2 pieces of woods at each side, you are left with very little space."
4,Excellent!,"Here is how I would rank the tracks featured: 1:Raspberry Swirl(Lip Gloss Ver.) 2:Mainline Cherry-Ambient Spark 3:Cruel-Shady Feline Mix 4:Ambient Raspberry Swirl-Scarlet Spectrum The Lip Gloss Version is definitely the best of all versions, despite being shorter than the original version. The additonal beats make it more of a dance track; it is also the version featured in the music video. The ""Spark"" remix is definitely worth listening to. The version of ""Cruel"" featured on this single also has additonal beats, and shorter (but better) than the original. The Scarlet Spectrum Feels mix of Raspberry Swirl is somewhat slow. Does anybody know why the STICKY extended mix of Raspberry Swirl was not included on the U.S. single but on the import? (Is it because it would make this CD a maxi single?)"
5,Why Raspberry Swirl should get five stars,"I have the chiorgirl hotel CD. It is still my favorite CD. The song Raspberry Swirl I find is different from A lot of Tori Amos' song including liquid diamonds. Raspberry Swirl is different because it has that techno beat like no other song on the CD. It proves that once and for all that Tori can attract anyone from people who like her piano-style music to dancers who like the beat of raspberry swirl. Even though the maximum is five stars, I think it deserves 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 starsTHANK YOU."
1,Wouldnt Buy again,This book for priced so high I thought you would get a series of books for the cost. I buy books like these at dollar tree for a dollar for one and paid over 12.oo for this
3,"Good sound, limited functionality","This system works well when using a DVD. The sound system does just what it should, creating a nice surround sound. My disappointment with the system is that it doesn't have any inputs--I had hoped to be able to use the sound system with regular television transmissions but can't. It also would be nice to feed a FM receiver, but can't. So its functionality is limited to just what you put in the optical disk reader. I wanted to return the system and the seller (AceElectronics) agreed to refund my purchase price, but the shipping costs were prohibitive; so, I'm going to keep the system and set it up on my secondary TV in my finished basement.If you want to augment regular television broadcasts sound, this system is not what you want--go with a receiver/amp. If you watch a lot of DVDs, then this system offers an inexpensive but quality solution."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this system after reading the many favorable reviews on Amazon.com. The setup instructions left a little to be desired, but it was fairly easy. Everything seemed fine and then, after about 3 weeks, the Front Right speaker went out. I tested the speaker and the wire which were both fine. With the exception of opening the case, there was no way for me to fix it. So, back in the box (which, of course, I didn't keep) and back to Amazon. Ordinarily, I try to stick with high-end stuff and I bought this for my kids. I learned my lesson with this one."
5,What a deal.,"Do not expect too much[]. Plays DVD/CD and comes with a Sub. For the money, it's a great gift, an excellent unit to put in an office or just about anywhere."
1,"It sounds great, if it didn't keep breaking!","I just receive my second system. Both of them broke with-in two weeks. This system sounded great for the money, but after a couple of weeks there was an internal system error which prevents anything from working - and it kept the CD's that were in them. I just can't trust Norcent any longer. The only good thing that came out of this was that this system is consistant...consistant in when it will break on you!"
1,Not Even Worth the Money,"The $100 I spent on this system was a waste of money. It has absolutely no power and if you turn it up above 10 or 11 everything is distorted. I had this system for about a year and the only thing it is good for is an overpriced paper weight. I sold this one for $50 at a yard sale and used the money to buy another home theater system for only $50 more than this one. It has 1000W of power and the sub-woffer alone has more power than the Norcent. I would not recommend this for even the most penny-pinching person. If you want a good deal, get something else."
3,It is ok kind of system,* Ok for a starter (will not satisfy an audiophile)* Ok for small rooms* Everything you expect from a DVD player is there* Plays everything you throw at it* Plays non-DVD media in 2.1 channels(2 speakers and a woofer)* Worth the money you invest
5,great for the money,"It has it all! It palys DVD, MP3, VCD, Music CD, CD-R, and even MPEG files. It also includes the receiver and speaker system.What is not so good is that only two front speakers and subwoofer have sounds when playing anything other than DVDs that support Dolby Digital 5.1-channel surround sound. And the subwoofer is too weak.Anyhow, what can you expect fot [inexpensive] system? I say it is a great buy!"
4,Well worth the $100,"I just got this yesterday, and I'm quite happy with it. It has some quirks (can't eject when you're not in DVD mode, it clicks when you're changing screens, etc.) but it sounds very good for a [value]system.The volume goes up to a possible 80, and I had to keep it around 60-65 when I watched a regular movie. I had it on 75 when I watched the action parts of Star Wars. So it probably shouldn't be used in a huge room. But mine is in my rec room / pool table room that is about 17 X 36, and it filled it with sound.The bottom line.....if you're a sound system expert, go buy a[n expensive] + system. If you're looking for a decent, cheap system to screw around and watch movies, this is great."
3,Small Entertainment System,"For the price, it is definitely worth buying. The Speakers sound great. The only problem is not all speakers work for various medium. For instance, all speakers work when youplay DVD, but not for CD nor VCD. The sound quality is still high. I would recommed not to put anything on top of the DVD Player, because it heats up pretty quickly. Overall, a good purchase."
4,Great value for the money,"I'd have to give this product 4/5. You cannot beat the price, and it plays everything you throw at it. The 5 speakers perform just as well as my expensive JVC home theatre system, but as others have noted, the 30W sub is underpowered. Still, a great buy for the money - one cannot complain at this price."
4,"Great Toy, for a Great Value","I love the size of this plane, I love plane models, and this one is Great. When I bought it, it was $16, and thats incredible cheap for the quality."
4,Nice replica of a B-2 Stealth bomber,"My wife wanted one to use as a model for drawing it after we saw it at the Air Show at the Vidalia Sweet Onion Festival in Vidalia, Ga. She is an artist and I wanted to get her a reasonably priced, reasonably accurate reproduction of it. She was delighted."
5,A Prayer for every occasion!,"Never be without the words to pray. This book has very lengthy and heart-felt prayers for a large number of topics. There are prayers for: the sick, for our country, for holidays like Christmas Eve, for children, for parents, for travelers etc. The list goes on and on and on! It is truly a useful addition to anybody's prayer time. It is also interesting to think that others may be praying the same prayer as you are!"
5,Say a Little Prayer,"This prayerbook covers seasons, events, and special days through-out the year. I bought three as gifts for elderly persons who seem to live and mark time through the usage of these books. They have not ceased remarking on the thought that motivated these gifts as inspirational."
4,Good video for toddlers eager to learn,"I bought this video for my now 19 month old daughter. She has been watching it for almost a month, and while it is not her absolute favorite (she like animals so Lil' Bloomer by the same company gets veiwed more often)she seems to enjoy it. By 'enjoy' I mean that she will respond to the images by pointing and naming and she really seems to like the other children doing things she recognizes. My only complaint is that the children are not on microphone so the sound quality is not what it should be. You hear the same ambient room noise you get on a home video recorder and some of the children's voices are just not as clear as others. Other than that, it's a fun and educational video."
3,Great if you don't get a leaky one,"I ordered six of these as groomsmen gifts. Of the six one came with a terrible blemish and the window leaked, another the window leaked. So 1 in 3 were defective. The other ones are great."
2,Free Zone Review,"I am a huge Natalie Portman fan but I could not get into this movie. The most annoying part is when they overlap two, sometimes three transparent scenes at one time making it difficult to even look at. It hurt my eyes. The opening scene where Natalie Portman is crying seemed overly forced, unnatural, and unnecessary. Additionally, I love watching movies with subtitles. The only part that is subtitled is when they are speaking a different language. I am glad that I bought it, but I will probably not watch it again."
2,Confusing!,"I could not make much sense of this movie. All the stars go to Alberstein's beautiful song ""Hada Gadia"""
2,Light very dim,"The light is too dim to be useable. Honestly, I am wondering if it is the light or the batteries. If it's the batteries, then Coast Cutlery needs to check them before shipping. Otherwise, their products are going to get a bad rap that is possibly undeserved (I have a Coast Cutlery V9 that I am very happy with).The construction is pretty nice. The batteries are a little hard to get out at first, but the V16 is solid, the bulb is protected, and the whole thing is really tiny. The light output is just horribly disappointing."
1,LL7526 minimal use flashlight,As advertised; this item looked like a great idea for working in tight spaces where a powerful light would be helpful. Instead the light was barely strong enough to read the wording on the packaging at close range. The cheap price is an indication of what you are getting. Unless a slim metal candle is what you are looking for; keep looking.
3,Someone please respond/review to this request 4 information.,"This ""reviewer"" would like to learn BEFORE ordering this penlightWHAT kind of battery/batteries it takes. Someone please answer w/a review to SPECIFY WHAT SIZE AND QUANTITY BATTERY is required tooperate this (apparently very nifty) flashlight. For example, thebattery SIZE is ""button"" (state which model number); the COUNT torun the light would be ?? # of cells (for example two AAA's, or 2button cells, whatever...). The reason I'd like to know (before Ibuy) is that I'll be ""stuck"" with a high-maintenance flashlight @so much money per set of hard-to-get batteries. It's one thing ifthe penlight takes AA or even AAA, but when/if it requires a AAAAor a set of button cells, then the cost and availability of thosespecialty batteries becomes a reason to abandon the thought of anonline order for the flashlight itself. Am a virgo... 'Nuff said?"
5,Best Little Pen Light Ever!,"I have owned a Coast LED Lenser for the last 6 years...then it disappeared. I used my pen light all the time. I loved it's size, weight and ease of use. I was crushed to discover the store I purchased it from no longer carried the pen light. I began my search, when I found it on Amazon.com I was elated! I purchased six so could share them with friends, and have a back up should someone borrow mine and ""forget""to return it! I was so excited when my pen lights arrived! I highly recommend the Coast LED Lenser!"
2,too small too bright,"As a big hairy nurse, I need something thats a little better fit in my paw. Too fine. I could put someones eye out with the intensity of this light. Great for seeing in the dark and roadside emergencies. Great for the guys doing maintanence in the hospital but not the nurses or EMS folks doing those neuro checks."
3,"cool penlight, batteries a pain","Given to me as a gift: slick package, a very small and lightweight smaller-than-a-penlight. i've used this on rounds at the hospital, but a few issues: 1) the batteries are not long lived, and tend to get drained, in addition the screw down mechanism to turn off the light is not very reliable (ie it is loose and easy to leave on/flickering) 2) the batteries are pin type 3V BR435 which are a pain to find. Also, I recently replaced them from a seller on ebay, and these are reversed in polarity from the Coast batteries (+ at the pin end) and do not fit properly. These issues offset the cool look of the pen, and practicality would seem to prevail. I would recommend something that takes an AAA battery that is easy to replace, especially if u use it as often as I would. Also the light is not very bright and somewhat bluish in tint."
1,This is not the original theatrical release,"This is an edited version of the original. As another reviewer commented the opening credits have been changed to a generic instrumental- it had been Willie Nelson's ""My Heros Have Always been Cowboys"". if you've seen the original opening you'll know why this is significant. Also I know there is at least one deleted scene where Sunny goes and gets help from Gus- again a significant loss to the film. I returned the DVD."
5,Western favorite,Beautiful scenery and beautiful music combined in a timeless story of someone trying to make a difference.
4,Watch it and judge for yourself...,"This is one of my favorite movies... mostly because it is so much more than a horse movie.. it is one man's journey into getting his life back on track by doing what he knows is right when all other voices are against him... After watching this movie you will understand the meaning of the words: ""conviction of the heart"". There is one of the most unique chase scenes I have ever watched and the cinematography of the horse as well as the incredible country scenes is breath taking... Give it a try... I think you will be pleasantly surprised..."
4,NOW YOU HEAR IT . . . NOW YOU DON'T !!,"The Electric Horseman is a film that has stayed with me since the first time I saw it when it was first released. I have to say the cinema photography is gorgeous and that the director and all the actors did a first rate job. (I have to tip my filmmaker's hat to John Saxon's portrayal of the determined Ampco CEO - he nailed it.)Others here have left cogent reviews of this Universal DVD 2003 edition as compared to the earlier Image DVD 1998 release. It is a shame that this ""latest"" DVD edition fixes the earlier DVD's video issue but has replaced Willie Nelson's original from-the-heart rendition of the ""title"" song. I find it almost amusing that a film whose story involves corporate chicanery has suffered from the same level of thinking. Here's hoping that Universal Studios gets it right with the overdue Blu-ray release."
5,Robert Redford Fan,This is one of my favorite Robert Redford movies especially because it's one of only a few of his movies where he does not die at the end.
3,Entertaining Romance,"If you're a fan of Robert Redford, catch this one: his ""modern day cowboy"" movie. Kind of a silly plot but good music by Willie Nelson. Jane Fonda looks mighty fine in her tight blue jeans as well!"
3,Interesting cowboy in a formula plot,"Sonny Steele (Robert Redford), a former rodeo champion turned breakfast cereal shill, seizes an opportunity to salvage his self-respect by stealing a former champion racehorse that is being abused by a big conglomerate with the goal of releasing him into the wild. Jane Fonda plays the wily newswoman who tracks him down and--no surprise--falls in love with him. The best parts of the film come early on as we get to know Sonny and his world. Once he steals the horse, it's all Big Issues Hollywood Love Story, albeit very well-made. This star vehicle is built around Redford and Fonda, so your opinion of the film is bound to be colored by your appreciation of those stars. ""Hanoi Jane"" Fonda-hater holdouts beware!"
2,What happened to the music?,"It is is the same wonderful movie I remember from years past but at least two songs from the excellent soundtrack,in particular ""My Heroes have always Been Cowboys,"" sung by Willie Nelson during the opening credits, have been edited from the movie and replaced with cheesey instrumentals that seriously damage the quality of the experience. The music was an essential in the telling of the story and I was quite disappointed when I watched my copy."
2,Universal Blew It !,"I agree with a previous reviewer that stated, ""The latest version has omitted Willie Nelson's ""My Heroe's Have Always Been Cowboys"" in favor of some generic faux-Western instrumental. The song was played during the opening credits and when Sonny releases Rising Star into the wild. When I watched the new version (not knowing there was a new version), I was left emotionally flat by the experience.""Also, the DVD had some audio to video syncronization problems. The image and the sound didn't match up perfectly. This is noticable when a character's lips doesn't quite match the words spoken.Plese, re-release this movie with these errors corrected!For these two resons I would have rated the DVD with one star. However, because I enjoy the movie's story so much, I rated it with two stars."
4,"Funny, Romantic, and Dramatic... and Robert Redford!","When washed-up rodeo champion Sonny Steele (Robert Redford) steals a Quarterhorse named Rising Star (who's a similarly washed up former champ), he sets off on a cross-country adventure with the goal being to set the horse free. The law follows, as does a tenacious reporter (Jane Fonda) who gets more story than she bargained for. Wonderful story of redemption and the right to personal freedom.Staci Layne Wilson"
5,Great Purchase,"I recieved the movie quickly & it was in perfect condition. This is a heartwarming story for the whole family.Thank you, Amazon."
2,Electric Horsemen DVD,"So far, I have not been able to make the DVD work in my DVD player. I keep getting the following message on my TV screen: ""Playback prohibited by region code."" I don't know what to do to get around this problem."
4,movie review,"An enjoyable, though not very believable, movie with Robert Redford and Willie Nelson; if you prefer a story over action and special effects. The chase scene is cars and motorcycles after a man on horseback. Too bad Fonda is in it."
5,Great movie!,"One of my favorite movies. Great cast, beautiful scenery, good story, just all around enjoyable. Also really like the soundtrack, can't beat Willie Nelson!"
1,The Electric Horseman,had to send it back because it would not play on my DVD player. It can only be played on a multi-region DVD player. I mailed it off on the 2nd of January 2013 and have not received my refund from Chalkys. I am wondering if I will ever get it.
1,Very Disappointed,"The DVD ELECTRIC HORSEMAN did NOT play in ""our region"" I had to waste money returning it. Will think twice about ordering in the future."
5,Great product,"For the past four Christmases, I have made batches of gourmet mustard for my entire extended family using Frontier Natural Yellow and Brown seeds. They make great mustard, and it's nice that they're organic."
4,A good product,"This works well for me. It would be a five star, if it were double-wall insulated to hold the heat longer. But it works well and that is seldom necessary."
2,You get what you pay for,"I saw this monitor in my local flyer for a very low price (with all the rebates and all) and decided to get two to replace my current 17"" LCD + 17"" CRT combo. I thought that a 25ms response time will be sufficient (my older LCD was 20ms and I had no problems with ghosting in games or anything else)...the 25 ms is horrible...I think its actually worse than that. When I opened up the task manager, the green background grid flickered every time it moved...dragging broswer windows with gray content is painful...and games, well, just forget about it. This monitor has awful ghosting. And another annoyance: in the OSD settings there is a choice between D-Sub or DVI, but the monitor doesn't have a DVI port...not impressed at all, will return these tomorrow and get something more expensive but more pleasant to look at."
5,Luther Vandross: Live at Wimbley,"What a awsome concert, you will think that you were right there and not watching it on DVD. Well worth it!!!"
5,Great addition to my library,The artist is deceased. He was one of my favorite male singers.Have seen him in concert many times.The video was simply the best and was very entertaining.I have shared it with family and friends and of course I have toldthem where I purchased my videos.It has met my expectations.
3,LUTHER,"I enjoy Luther, I didn't enjoy this concert as much. I'm not unhappy that I purchased this DVD."
4,This music convinced a non-believer...,"I first listened to this CD half-heartedly, not knowing what I was getting myself into. What has been publicized about rap lately is how brutal it has gotten, everyone killing or being killed. As soon as I heard the title track, I remembered what it was like in the good old days, when all that mattered was being with your honey and heading to the beach. Even though I was more used to mellow music, something about the smooth beats and subtle rhythms sucked me in, and created a fan. The Marksman has taken us back to basics, before all the hate... of course, it's up to us to join him for the ride."
4,You have to see her in concert!,"I never heard of Angelique Kidjo until I was invited to go to her show in Louisville, KY. I was totally blown away by her voice, her music, and her dancing ability. Her music is a blend of all types and she serves it up so well. I'm impressed and I love her music"
1,Intergalactic,"I was at a concert in Portland Oregon (The String Cheese Incident)for NYE, and during the set break - this funky version of Voodoo Child came on. I was blown away and continued to listen to this CD. I ran to the soundboard and asked ""Whats the deal w/ this music - Im melting! "" The rest is history."
2,"Pretty good moves, no workout","This dvd could be really good, but it misses the mark. MaDonna Grimes and the backup dancers are good dancers and I like the moves, but it is definitely not a workout. I didn't even break a sweat. Her ""chummy"" talk with the backup dancers gets annoying too. It's also way too short. Good if you want to just learn some dance steps, but not if you're looking for a cardio workout."
2,Urban Street Heat save your money,"MaDonna Grimes directions calling out the steps were great, but they need a different camera crew, the camera view while she is instructing you is either all over the place on her and then on the other dancers, or on the upper torso to the head instead of the feet when she is instructing a step, thought the camera angles made it difficult to follow, rarely was the view of the entire person making the routine difficult to follow. I really do not need the zoom in on the chest up to learn a move. I would save your money."
3,"Good, but not for me","I'm sure there are people who will love this DVD. I was a previous dancer and have enjoyed other dance workout videos. (QuickFix with Julianne Arney, in my opinion, is a VERY fun dance workout.) I just felt that this was more like being in a club or on the streets than a real ""dance"" workout. Of course, it DOES say that this is ""urban street heat"" right on the cover which is why I didn't rate it lower than I did. I'm sure if that is what you are looking for then you'll enjoy it."
1,More for dancers than for exercisers...,I was most disappointed with this as an exercise video. I think it's more for teaching dance steps to someone who is interested in becoming a dancer in some video for a rap group. I am sticking with my walking exercise videos.
5,Great dvd,"I used to weight 209lbs now I weight 170lbs and because I worked out to this video and her latin video. THANK YOU MADONNA FOR A FUN WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT! And for those who are saying that it is not for beginners, yes it is! I don't think I can dance but I figured the moves out by watching first then practice them. Her videos make you challenge your body and yourself. If you can not do it well her videos are not for you. No offense"
3,Beginnerish,"The exercise portion of the video is much shorter than I expected. 30 minutes of exercise. MaDonna Grimes presents very warm and friendly atmosphere both in her introduction and through out the DVD. The music used is up beat and generic tune so you aren't going to be stuck listening to a song you may not like. Each new move is offered as part of a section of the overall dance/exercise routine. The exercise is part of learning the moves to an overall routine and then finally doing the routine a couple of times.The dance moves are, however, shown at a speed that is going to be a bit fast for someone who does not have experience in exercise routines or dance routines. Ms. Grimes uses real dance moves. If this type is exercise is new to you, expect to spend several days learning all of the moves."
3,FUN!!!,Bought this for my 16 year old daughter who wanted to learn dance moves while exercising. We have fun doing it together.
2,This is no allstar workout....,"I am a big fan of the allstar workouts on FitTv. I purchased this dvd thinking I was gonna get the same kind of instruction and cardio workout from MaDonna Grimes. And instead, this video was some hip hop dancers displaying their talents. The music was bad and the dance routine was not repeated enough to get a good cardio workout. Very disappointing."
3,Good Work out Video,"I have own other dance video that were to hard to flow. I have to say that Madonna dose seem to take it slow and breaks down the moves. The dance is broking down in 8 counts, but the one thing MaDonna dosen't do is break down the count for you. Also I did found that near the end of the dance routine she seem to speed thing up. If you don't mine rewinding to lean the last two 8 count, then you should be fine."
2,Felt silly,I felt really silly doing these dance steps. That pretty much sums it up. It did give a decent workout tho.
5,Love This Workout!,"I've had this workout for about two years and it's still one of my favorites! So much fun that I've actually done it twice in a row some days. Madonna and her crew are really laid back, they joke and laugh throughout the workout which is such a nice change from a lot of those stiff, cookie-cutter dance workouts. It's like hanging around the house and having a dance party with your friends.When I first started doing this workout, I found myself breathless within the first five minutes (which was still the warmup). But since I've had this for so long and have moved on to harder workouts, I do find that I have to exaggerate the moves some times to get that heart rate up a little more, so decidedly it's very good to keep around for those ""light"" days or when I just want to loosen up a bit. But when I get going, man, I just never want to stop! Definitely a great workout."
4,"Light, dance workout","I really like dance workouts, so I thought I'd check out this one. While this DVD is fun, you really aren't going to get much of a workout. It lasts a little over 30 minutes (including warm up and cool down), I think, and is very low impact and the dancing is slow paced. I hardly sweat at all and suspect I burn less than 100 calories using it.But one nice thing about this DVD is that Madonna and her background dancers are friendly and interact with each other during the workout. You get the sense that they all knew each other before creating the DVD. The dance moves are not at all difficult to learn, and a beginner could probably pick them up quickly - especially since the music is rather slow. The set and production are good.I use this DVD on days when I don't feel like exerting myself much, or to loosen up after a strength training workout. For something slightly more intense, try Madonna's African Beat, Latin Heat DVD."
1,not for beginners as stated on cover.,"I am a beginner, I though it was too many moves to learn, not enough repetitions. And to add to the dificulty of coordinate all the steps (and arms) together it was frustrating that the camera angles kept moving around zooming in and out! I guess was just not a good teaching method because I have been doing many dancing workout videos and I was able to follow the other teachers without a problem. If you are a begginer don't buy. If you are expert you probably won't have this problem."
5,'For the Very 1st Time',"This DVD was too much FUN, especially because I have never tried a dance video or been a dancer in my life! I just did the routine for the very first time this morning...didn't get all the moves right and it didn't matter. This DVD is for beginners, not professional dancers or the intimidatingly in shape veterans of body sculpting. I am 46 and by now I know you just work up to your level, and then move on to the next one. I would definitely order another MaDonna Grimes DVD...when I'm ready! I know she'll take me there."
1,Too advanced for me,"I recently purchased multiple beginner fitness dvds to diversify my home workout options. I don't normally feel like going to the gym, so I thought these would be a solid home remedy. Of the three I purchased, this is the only one that I didn't opt to keep on my shelf. It was a little too much for me as a beginner. I tried it twice, and I just couldn't get the hang of it. I reviewed the later parts of the tape, and I decided that my other dvds would cover my needs well enough."
2,Not very urban...,"This is a generally inoffensive DVD. The music is rather bland for ""urban"" dancing (I was expecting something rap/hiphop-ish). The background dancers wouldn't make the most rural midwestern farmer glance twice at them. Everything was just kind of... nice. Bland. Okay.As others have said, this really isn't for beginners. The instructor moves fast and introduces many many moves and steps. I was totally lost and ended up just randomly jumping/stepping around to keep my heartrate up while peering at the screen, trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing.If I could, I'd give it another half-star. It's not a horrible exercise DVD, but there are tons better."
2,Not much for the moneyou won't get it,Video is way too short and doesn't give as good of a workout as i had hoped. Please do not use for a workout...you won't get one.
1,ugh...,"not at all what I expected..much too complicated and fast paced. more suited to hip hoppers, not my style at all"
2,Not for beginners,"I just finished going through the video for the fourth time. I wanted to give it an honest try at repetitive learning. Considering that this was labeled as a beginner session, my expectation was that the demos would be a little slower and provide more repetition. It could just be me, but it does seem as the video gets closer toward the end, the quicker the pace begins to move, with more complicated movements. Each time, I would stop to study the moves, because I got completely lost. Let me also say that I've always had good rhythm, timing and dance ability, and been involved in various physical activities. At one point, it just looks like they are really enjoying the recording of the video, and forget that they are there to teach the viewers??Bottom line, I would not suggest this video for beginners of dance videos."
5,Some fresh new ideas for your job search,"""Selling You"" gives you a fresh approach and excellent basic skills (such as resume and cover letter examples) and new ways to look at the job search. You can tweak these ideas to fit your personality.One of the new concepts is The Four Square Planner. It shows you how to give excellent answers in an interview.

Everything follows a logical pattern and is very helpful."
2,Falls short,"This book moved along at a fairly good pace, but it went nowhere. Then an ending involving a stock market scenario really sunk this story as far as I was concerned."
2,overpriced,"They work, and they are nice but I think a person with a tiny bit of ingenuity could make these for about $2 a pop. Go to a fabric store, buy some ribbon, install a couple snaps and you are done."
4,Why didn't anyone notice this one?,"The only reason this album didn't sell millions is because RVS's negative publicity at the time, such as his spat with the CMA. This cd is a pretty classy affair. All the songs are pretty strong, and there are at least 4 hit singles that should have been. Get this while you can, before it is totally forgotten."
4,well worth the price,"seeing you can pick this cd up for next to nothing it is well worth the price.highlights are southbound nobody knows dreams and revival,the more you listen to this cd the more youll love it."
5,The best baby video I've seen,"This is the best baby video I've ever seen. It really does it all. My baby loves it!!!!! I love it!!!!! It's smartly done, and very entertaining."
4,Thank you,I wish to thank those who have given a review for my book and sent me e-mails. It is encouraging and I wish to continue on the work that I have undertaken.I would also request the readers to provide their technical comments on the subject.Thank you once again for your appreciation.Arijay Chaudhry
4,Informative,The book written by Mr. Chaudhry was quite informative for a begineer like me. It provided wonderful insights into what prevails in the GATT and WTO segments and generates interest to learn more on the subject.Arindam Banerjee
4,Interesting,Author has done a good job. Vast areas of trade interest covered. Indepth research. Philosophy of the trading system has been adequately covered. Very direct in his writing.Gopalswamy N
4,Many jokes are based on simple thoughts of people,"This collection of jokes is indexed based on the subject of the joke. Published in 1945, the jokes often have a quaint appeal rather than the harder edge of more modern humor. Nevertheless, in 491 pages, it is possible to find a joke that will appeal to you. If you like jokes that are based on the simple thoughts of people, then this is the book for you."
3,"Horslips - Dancehall Sweethearts - original ""digitally re-mastered"" CD release on Outlet/Homespun records","Horslips - Dancehall Sweethearts - original ""digitally re-mastered"" CD release on Outlet/Homespun recordsTracks are:1. Nighttown Boy2. The Blind Can't Lead the Blind3. Stars4. We Bring the Summer With Us5. King of the Fairies6. Mad Pat7. Blindman8. Sunburst9. Lonely Hearts10. The Best Years of My LifeThis is the original and out of print older ""digitally re-mastered"" version of this album on CD. A nice collectible piece for the Horslips fan that has everything, but for a first time fan I recommend picking up the newer remaster on Demon records which was released under direct supervision by the band after they reacquired their back catalog."
5,The most refreshing and talented band you can possibly find.,The more I hear this CD the more I find in it. In this day and age of bands trying to find a hook or a gimmick it is so cool to find a band whose gimmick is being really great musicians. All of their songs have tunes that are catchy and stay with you. But the hook is the lyrics. All the songs are well written. You will rock and you will get pulled in. From 'Waiting for Godot' to the addictive 'Ultraman' Jonasay will deliver some of the finest songs you have ever heard. You can not go wrong with this CD.
4,Excellent - I want more...,"I picked up a copy of Jonasay's CD at a recent show, inspired by the energy of their live performance. What accolade can I give other than it has had a permanent spot in my CD changer ever since?My only critique would be that some of the great songs they play in the live show are not on it! Give me more so I can give a 5 star award next time!"
1,I want my money back...,"After listening to this garbage, I not only wanted my money back, but the time I wasted listening to it as well."
4,"Delicious, Amusing Read","I picked this book up while on vacation in Europe and might not have bought it had my husband not been simultaneously browsing through another copy and actually laughing aloud. After the first few pages, however, I was hooked, and laughed so hard over several passages that I nearly choked. I am a high school English teacher, choosy in my vacation material reading, and can only say I cannot remember a book I have enjoyed more. This is indeed ""Bridget Jones"" from a male perspective, but with a kind of Dickensian twist - Barrowcliff has a habit of digressing from his plot to make bitingly funny, satirical fun of the dating games inherent in the 30-something singles world. One cannot help but sympathize with the narrator, who is saved from utter villainy only by the clarity with which he views his own faults. The ending is surprisingly poignant and a very fine piece of work. For pure pleasure, absolutely excellent reading!"
4,Quirky and fun!,"Ah yes, the quest for the perfect woman. I actually bought this book before it hit the states, as reading material for a return flight from London. I could not have picked a better read.The dry English humor and the authentic British slang constantly remond you that the book is not set in the states -- a refreshing change from similar novels I have read that seem dull in comparison due to that fact that Anywhere, USA is a setting for far to many books.It's like Bridget Jones from the viewpoint of the opposite sex, with quirky flatmates for added flavor. If you liked Bridget Jones, give this one a try!"
1,Where was this book going?,"I read the first 40 pages and had to just give up. I usually enjoy books written by the Brits, but this one was like pulling teeth to get through. Perhaps I'll give it another chance when I have finished reading the stack of books I still have in front of me and change my mind, but I doubt it.If I had the chance to do it over again, I wouldn't have wasted my money."
5,The Funniest Book I've Ever Read,"Girlfriend 44 is the sort of book you always look for but can never quite find-the sort that you want to read in one sitting but you can't because it's so good you want it to last forever. You end up reading it at outdoor cafes and laughing out loud, not caring who hears you or what they think, you read it half hanging off of your bed, comfortably slumped as its spell overtakes you, you lope down the street with a goofy grin on your face as though you are in love.The setting is modern London, the heroes are Lost Boys who live for a pint and the perfect woman, but you don't have to be an Anglophile to appreciate the sarcastic irony of this male confessional.It's a male ""Bridget Jones"" or a ""High Fidelity"" without the music. There's even a bit with a dead body. Highest marks for this book."
5,Barrowcliffe is a master of the male confessional.,"Women do not like this book. In fact, they don't seem to understand this AUTHOR at all. Barrowcliffe is a master of the male confessional, and the women who have reviewed his writing obviously have difficulty facing up to the honesty that Barrowcliffe laces into the descriptions and dialogs within his books. It is unfortunate, but true, that men are inclined toward a cycle of self destruction and are constantly the cause of their own undoing.The narrator of this book lives true to that premise and much of the book centers around the search for the right woman, the intricacies of courting, and the Mallory principle which has been the destruction (and justification) of so many men.Women don't want this to be the way men work, but Barrowcliffe's painful honesty when dealing with his subject matter is what makes this book truly stand out....Sorry ladies."
1,Maybe it's me....,"Maybe it's me, but I read about 30 pages and put this book down. I had a hard time getting into it, understanding the humor, following what was going on...They introduce you to Harry with a letter he writes in the first chapter and then he's at home & i guess kinda thinking to himself & then we see his two friends. Then it gets hard to follow what is going on, he's thinking to himself, he's reminiscing about his family, then he's talking with his friends, he's looking at pics of old girlfriends, some girl decides to stop by, they are analyzing a letter his friend Gerrard wrote....where is he going with all of this?! I felt over-whelmed, did he want to introduce us to the character, his family? His friends?? Then mix past with present?? Then you hear about how Gerrard is a kind of womanizer, but I thought Harry was too? It's unclear what traits they have that seperate them. I guess this book isn't my cup of tea!"
4,hhhhhhhhh ouch.,"As all his books start out with painful relationship problems this one would be a welcome addition to any bookshelf, still buy and read ""Infidelity for first time fathers"" that should be made into a movie....."
3,Poorly printed/type set,"I ordered this book but returned it without reading it due to poor print quality. As i've repeatedly found since moving to the US, the standard of book printing on amazon.com is often really inferior to the British versions of the same books available at amazon.co.uk. The type on this book was small and ran into the gutter in the book's spine. It was not set centrally on the page. It's a subtle thing, but I find it makes the book much less easy/enjoyable to read. I have now ordered the book from the amazon in the uk.This seems to be a recurring problem with amazon USA books."
5,"My Favorite Thai Cookbook, Still","I have used this cookbook for years. And, for years I've been meaning to post a review. Every recipe I've made is delicious and there have been many. Believe my favorite is Chicken and Red Curry"
5,As Good As They Come,"If you love westerns of the era (late 40's - early 50's), I have no way of comprehending how you wouldn't love this one. If you've never seen it, see it. If you're interested in, but not familiar with great westerns of the era, this as good a place to start as any. I don't think there's anything else you need to know."
2,Not One of James Stewart's Best,"Not one of James Stewart's better movies. In fact, it is just a very ordinary sort of western, if you make allowances for the fact that it takes place in the Yukon, and the ""ordinary"" western is in American territories. The difference is not a significant one.Stewart is the only real star in it, although you will recognize Walter Brennan and Henry Morgan, who has a minor role. Brennan is Stewart's partner in a herd of cattle first, and then in a mining claim, and Stewart is supposedly one of these hard-bitten types who doesn't care about anyone. But he cares about his partner, and two women care about him. And of course, he learns to care about others.Too much is cliche, too predictable, and frankly, I was disappointed. But James Stewart is one of my favorite actors, so I'll give it two stars."
2,Unremarkable 50's western,Some nice location shooting is wasted in a standard western. The female characters are particularly irritating and one-dimensional. This is definitely the worst Anthony Mann/James Stewart pairing.
1,Poor Product Poor Product Service,"The results of my purchase experience thru Amazon for this product makes me very sure I will never again go through Amazon for anything. The DVD didn't work and the suppliers answer was to wipe it off with alcohol and try it again. I did, it still didn't work. Rather than work with me to get me a DVD that worked the supplier refunded my money. According to Amazon that was done in the required time. I guess I should be thankful I got my money back.I WON'T EVER USE AMAZON AGAIN THEY DO NOT FORCE THEIR SUPPLIERS TO GO THE EXTRA MILE. THEY ENCOURAGE THE QUICK FIX."
2,The cliches ride again,"If this western thrills you, life must be pretty dull. The plot is barely understandable within the first 45 minutes. No characters emerge as more than one dimensional. Ruth Roman, huge bra and full makeup on the trail, smirks a lot. Corinne Calvet, 30 years old, is supposed to be a sex-starved teen and is given many embarrassing lines. Walter Brennan plays Walter Brennan. The villains sneer and scowl. Jimmy Stewart glares a lot and is supposedly tough. And then the big shoot-out. Save your five bucks; the scenery isn't worth it."
4,Another Colorful Stewart-Mann Western,"This is a ""must-have"" for any fan of the genre. This film is marked by wonderful cinematography, colorful characters, and a witty script by Borden Chase (""Red River""). Stewart once again portrays a character who is basically a hard-bitten loner with a soft spot only for his side-kick, Walter Brennan. The film has a great supporting cast, including Brennan, Jay C. Flippen, John McIntyre, Harry Morgan, Royal Dano and Jack Elam. Alaska has never looked better than in this Technicolor delight. One minor comment about the tape's packaging: it indicates that this is the first time the film has been made available on video. Not quite true: my copy was issued by Kartes Video Communications under license from MCA Home Video in 1982!"
1,Rating is for the studio's botched work,"Maybe they think that, by butchering widescreen formats, it will help to fight piracy (although I'm sure some nerds will like to pirate crap, just for the fun of it), but for me (and, I can see I'm not the only one), the only result of disrespect for original movies' format only helps in not buying until movies are released in the right screen ratio."
1,Waste of money,This product is not worth .5 cents! Don't waste your money on it! It lasted all of an hour before it fizzled out and almost electrocuted my entire fish tank! Please don't buy it!
1,Do NOT buy this heater,"I just got this today. I have a nice one on order here and decided to just grab a cheap one until mine comes in and as a back-up heater. Mistake. I let this sit in the tank for an hour before I turned it on and three hours later, my son and I hear a loud pop. Imagine my horror as I can see water start to go up the unit and can see it still heating up. I quickly unplugged it and will be returning it to the store tonight. I don't expect a cheap heater to last a long time but I do expect it to last a night at least. I'm surprised by this though because Hagen usually makes some decent products. Avoid this heater and spend just a few dollars more for a better one."
1,worthless waste of time and money,"I bought two of these heaters, both after about a month and a half broke. There is something wrong with the thermostat in them, they both heated up red hot and the glass busted. I've never seen heaters do this before. Don't waste your money on these!"
2,Not a good design!,"This Aquarium Water Heater does heat the water BUT its temperture probe location is 1/2"" from the top of the unit. When you start with a clean Aquarium, for two days it works, then its sensor probe is no longer in the water (evaporation) but instead in the air above the water! How does it know what temperature the water is??? In order for you to make it work correctly you have to keep the water all the way to the top of the Aquarium ALL of the time, fill it every day."
1,No good,"This is a very old version of a fish tank heater. These you have to turn on and off manually when the water hits or drops below the temp you want and they are very fragile. Mine arrived broken. Spend a little more money and get something newer and better. These are not even ""shock proof"" for the fish."
3,Great Priced Aquarium Heater,The price was great and it works flawlessly. The only gripe I have about it is that the mounting device requires it so sit over the lip of the aquarium making it impossible for me to keep the water level at the required fill line on the heater. Still keeps the temperature in the tank at a wonderful 79 degrees but I do wish it could be lowered further into the tank.
1,Are you kidding me?,"I purchased one and was extremely dissapointed. The temperature strip was missing, and after 2 days it started to crack. And no the crack did not come from my fish. I cant believe someone would sell something like this. Where is the common decency? I will never buy anything from this seller again."
1,DO NOT USE ON ANYTHING OVER 5 GALLONS,I set up a 10 Gallon tank using this heater. The heater blew up after 5 days of use. Not a good value
1,Fried my fish!,"I had a 10-gallon tank with some beautiful mollies. I just had to house them for one day before they could be added to a 55-gallon tank. This heater couldn't even handle the task for one day. Overnight, it unexpectedly overheated and fried my fish. Don't be cheap: if you care about your fish, invest in a decent submersible heater with a reliable thermostat. When it comes to aquarium heaters, you really do get what you pay for. Unfortunately, I had to learn this the hard way."
1,Can be deadly,After having used this heater for over 6months now I think I can safely conclude that it's very badly designed and can be deadly. In my case I constantly struggled with trying to keep the temperature of the water at the right levels by having to adjust the knob and then go back into monitoring my thermometer. One day while I was cleaning my aquarium apparently the knob turned a little over the normal without having a stop it fried all my fish. Now I know this was accidental but the system should have a safety shut off temperature in their internal sensor goes over 85F. No tropical fish and very few sea water fish can survive that temperature. In my case I woke up with an aquarium full of dead fishes. Use my review as caution unless you want to constantly monitor manually the temperature and some day may wake up with DEAD fishes.
1,poor design,"poor design, ended up being useless, too costly and too much trouble to send back. really disappointed. this is a case where had i saw it in a store I wouldn't even have considered it."
5,good things come in small packages!,"This is a book that packs a lot of worthy information into a small book that is easy to backpack. You will need detailed topo maps as those in the book are for overview only, but the hikes are exquisitely detailed and accurate. Many of the trips are in the less well-known areas of Nevada and Eastern California and will please those who like to hike without meeting anyone else. The author encourages readers to find alternative routes to destinations and, although most of the trips are to peaks, there are some easier canyon hikes. Longer trips definitely need experience and route-finding abilities."
4,Very easy install,"If the Deer Alert 20501 truly works as well as it is to install, no one should hit a deer again. The ease of installion varies from vehicle to vehicle not from the product itself."
4,Stops you dead in your tracks.,"I was drafted but never went to Viet Nam. This book is a collection of personal stories of those that did. It is these people that I remember on Veterans Day. A gripping book that answers the question, ""What was it like over there?"""
5,This CD gets better every time you listen to it!,"The songs on this CD quickly etch themselves into your brain until you can't live without it. Powered by heavy guitars and intricate keyboard lines, fans of all rock styles should love this. The upbeat, catchy music may first lead you to ignore the lyrics. Don't! They are shockingly blatant and deep; check out ""B.F.C."" and ""The Foreign Dime."" I get the feeling that this is the product of a deranged, brilliant band that has more surprises in store for the future."
2,"Considering we're big music critics, it was so/so","This cd was ok, but we don't think it will be making MTV soon. The keyboardest needs work, but the rest of the band is SUPER DUPER! Also, the lyrics need work. I think some day the ATOMSMASHERS might have a big hit!"
2,This could have been better,"The women where outstanding, but it took to long for anything to happen. And hey if you like naked men, this will do as well. Not me - should have gotten something else."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I saw the cover for this one & the rental at the movie store was constantly out - I figured it must be a doozy! After I ordered it & viewed it, I honestly was quite disappointed.I don't want to see guys as much as the women, the scenes feature the girls in clothing as much (if not more than) in the buff, the scenes are SSSLLLLOOOWWW and fairly corny, almost to the irritating point. Nonetheless, beautiful naked women as expected, but nothing I would watch again if it were STILL in my collection. A whole video on Bethany Lorraine any day would suit me fine after seeing her scene though!"
5,a must see,"excellent video. a little too much story line at time, but the footage makes up for that. lots of great playmates in this video, scenes 4 and 6 only lag a little because of their shortness. excellent scenes, quality women, quality video."
2,ehhh,They put Karin McDougal in it. For that I thank them. But they paired her up with the unpleasant Daphnee Duplaix. For that I won't forgive them. The second star is for Kalin Olson. Wow! Overall you can do better with a calender or another collection.
2,"Not bad quality, but be aware of wire gauge","The wire gauge used in this cable is extremely light. The resulting increased resistance in the cable reduces the signal at the speaker. So if you had balanced stereo before using this extension, you probably won't afterward. For the price (and free shipping), I took a chance and ordered it knowing this might happen.Ultimately - like the technical info for games, which conveniently leaves out important details like ""it uses Steam"" or ""it uses ""SecureRom"" - this is a case of Amazon not providing enough information. The technical details for an extension cable like this should include the wire gauge used."
2,cheap and not so good,"I purchased 2 of them just in case and guess what ? one of them just worked 2 days before it stop sending signal to the other speaker , seems like disconnected cable inside by the head , the other one so far so good , if you use them and never touch again then go for it but if you going to switch all the time it will not last long .."
4,OK'ish cable,"This cable comes for a very low price and works as expected.The only thing that left me dissatisfied was the thin diameter of the cable which means less reliability and durability. In certain cases, it may also lead to interference.However, I still give it 4* because of the low price. You get what you pay for... so as far it works, it's fine.(Above caution is specially for those people who plan to conceal the cable somewhere. It would make sense that you buy a more expensive cable. You would not want to conceal this cable only to realize a few months or an year down the line that the cable has broken away)."
2,THIS IS NOT A GREATEST HITS!,"Although this cd contains great songs, it fails to captue the wizardry and true talents of the Pharcyde. If you do not have a Pharcyde Cd, do not get this so you have the best songs, this album just doesn't cut it. Pick up ""Bizarre Ride...."" before anything. This Cd just leaves out too much, using over 4 of thier interludes and skits to fill up the 18 tracks, they are very funny skits though."
4,Rare and well done,"This CD features ""rare and unreleased tracks from the golden era of soul"". These recordings are taken from the Stax/Volt vaults and almost all of them are previously unreleased. Some of these songs have been released before, but these are alternate takes. Considering that these recording weren't considered ""good enough"" to be released when they were first recorded, the quality of the music is very good. There aren't any bad songs here, and some of them are actually great. I especially like Booker T & the MGs version of ""Dock of the Bay"". The two Otis Redding alternate takes are dynamite. And Eddie Floyd turns in an electrifying live version of his classic ""Knock on Wood"". Recommended to fans of '60s soul."
2,Invaders,This film has very little to praise it. My advice is save your money and wait for the release of the orginal tv series.
2,Fair Remake of the 60's series,"Long before David Duchovny's Fox Mulder was chasing alien conspirators, Roy Thinnes in the person of David Vincent was on a one-man crusade to reveal the aliens among us. This 1995 miniseries stars Scott Bakula in a similar role. Thinnes appears briefly as Vincent. Richard Thomas, who seems not to have aged a day since ""The Waltons,"" is one of the humans taken over by the malevolent aliens.A routine exercise in science fiction politics, the film benefits from a knock-out performance from Jon Polito, late of ""Homicide: Life on the Streets,"" as a harried subway operator. His is the only reason for viewing although he doesn't appear until the film's last quarter."
2,The price is Wrong !!!,How can this DVD be $99.99 in any format. i havew a PAL system but not for $99 dollars. Minus well buy the Ufo as well
4,Great cracker,"Since attending a raw food retreat, I searched for a good flax seed cracker that I did not have to dehydrate myself. This cracker provides excellent taste, plus it is thick enough to spread cheeses, almond butter, and other foods without breaking. If you are looking for something like a saltine or even a rye crisp, this cracker isn't for you. But if you are looking for a good flax seed cracker, you will like this alternative."
3,Something stinks!,"You say this goo motorhead. This no goo motorhead, this stale motorhead. I kick this record producer in groin for making pop motorhead. I hit him with my wok, and poke him with chop stix. Bad producer, you go away now! You only try to make money don't know music. You go bye. Go away NOW!I smell the stench of a major record label on this recording. The producers were obviously bending the music more in the direction of heavy cheese pop of the early 90's. As a consequence it does not stand the test of time like ""Spades or Another Perfect Day"". I wonder if they made Lemmy dress up in a little blue suit? He probably wore white socks.On the positive side, its not a terrible body of work, some of the lyrics are decent and the sound quality of the recordings are good. 3 star"
3,I was not jumping for joy,"when I heard this one. I'll say it is OK. It is more blues driven then the previous recordings and it does contain some good points. The title song of this album is one of the best songs (musically and lyrically). I own it and I will listen to it, but unless you are a true blue, I'd leave it behind."
2,It's okay!,"""March or die"" (1992) is far from Motörhead's better moments. It's a decent rock album with its best songs in the first half of the album. The opening ""Stand"" is alright, and so are ""Bad religion"" and ""Jack the ripper"". But the highlight is the semi ballad ""Ain't no nice guy"" - a duet with Ozzy Osbourne, and the heavy ""Hellraiser"". The cover of Ted Nugent's ""Cat scratch fever"" is not surprising in any way, and the same goes for most of the songs on this release. In fact, the five last songs seem to be more or less fillers. It can't be a higher rating than 2 stars!"
3,March or Die,"I think this album stands alone in the Motorhead catalogue. Although a heavy metal band needs to survive, this album is much more commercial than anything else.However, I feel happy about purchasing motorhead March or Die album, if not about the heavy sound itself, there still are some great kind of singles, like Too good to be true, you better run, Hellraiser, etc.Although March or Die it's not a very exciting album, It's not an album to be forgotten, I think if you like heavy metal, you must purchase this album.More than anything else, this is a Motorhead album, and that count a lot."
5,Well worth the purchase!,"Not having seen any live performances of the group, this DVD gave me that opportunity. I wish there were other performances that were available to buy. I love the sound and especially Gilmore's voice. Can't get enough!"
3,Good micro system with one flaw.,"Great looking system and it sounds great too. The DVD player doesn't work at all. Even with new DVD's they skip every 20 seconds. I loved the sound and the look, but I had to return it because of the DVD player. I would give the amp and speakers 5 stars and the DVD player 1 star."
1,Low Quality - Broken with in 3 months,Bought this.The DVDs did not play well from day 1. Gets stuck in between.Three months it worked. After that we had some popping sound and wire circuit burning smell and did not work.
4,NICE sound!,This is a great simple piece of equipment that looks and sounds great. The thing with this is that it only has one AUX output and the cables are cumbersome.
5,VICTOR MANUELLE! WHAT A MAN!!!,"VICTOR MANUELLE. WHAT CAN I SAY? FOR ALL YOU LATIN LADIES OUT THERE HERE IS THE NEXT GORGEOUS GUY TO DROOL OVER. AS FOR ME, I'M A HOPELESS ROMANTIC AND I CAN LISTEN TO HIS MUSIC ALL DAY LONG. HIS VOICE ALONG WITH THE WORDS AND THE MUSIC TAKES YOU TO ANOTHER WORLD. FOR THE GUYS: HE'S A GOOD ARTIST TO USE TO SEDUCE WOMEN. HE'S ROMANTIC, HE'S NEW, HE'S GOT THE OLD STYLE, HE'S JUST AN ALL AROUND GREAT ARTIST AND SONGWRITER. TAKE IT FROM ME I DON'T GO ALONG WITH THE TRENDS. VICTOR MAKES YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH HIS VOICE ALONE, BEFORE YOU EVEN LOOK AT A PICTURE OF HIM. AND WHEN YOU DO, BE STILL YOUR HEART!!!"
5,Billyboy,"I have used the neon green highlight spray for St. Patrick's Day for two consecutive years. It works perfectly on my gray mustache. One of my buddies used it on his blonde/gray mustache and beard this year and it also looked great. We had our picture taken numerously. I tried to highlight my niece's dark brown/black hair and you could not even see it. That was disappointing. But for a light colored or gray hair, this is great fun. It washes out of my hair in two washings, one right after another. I am ordering more in more colors."
2,New formula sucks,"I had been using this product for the last 1.5 years or so to help hide the thinning area on the crown of my head. It used to work great. But they have changed the formula and now it rubs off incredibly easy. You can not touch your head after you spray this on. The slightest touch will rub it off. It didn't use to be this way. It also goes all over the place and really coats your bathroom with the stuff. I thought perhaps it was just a bad batch, but this continued over the next few months of purchases. I have since stopped using this product and now use another which is great. I don't think I can name other products on these reviews so I'll just give you a hint - it's made in Germany and you can order it here on Amazon."
2,Not practical for stretching visits to your hair stylist,"I bought this in the Burnt Brown color to use at my roots and the frame of my face to cover the greys until I can get my hair colored again in a few weeks. The directions say to hold the can 12 inches away, so it's hard to shield your face from overspray when held this way. It will come off on your fingers and face if you touch your hair. It doesn't seem to dry ever. When washing my hair, it also stained my fingernails again. While coverage of grey was great, I can't recommend regular use of this temporary product unless you have precision application skills and you never touch your hair. Will stain yur clothes and towels, so be cautious about how you remove it from your skin."
5,Wonderful Stories and fun illustrations,"The Bedtime Book of Bible Stories is designed for toddlers and young children, but will still appeal to early elementary age children. My youngest son and I enjoyed the book before bedtime, sharing the stories and prompted to conversation by the questions at the end of each of the stories. He is a third grader and is familiar with many of the old and new testament stories in the book, but still really enjoyed it.The ten classic Bible stories in the book are written in perfect length for ""bedtime"", with a reflection question at the end of each leaving time for a few minutes of prayer and reflection before you tuck in your little one. Early readers will enjoy this one, as each page contains approximately five to ten simple lines of text. Stephanie McFetridge Britt's wonderful illustrations help the stories to come alive. This one will give you and your children sweet dreams and happy bedtime memories."
5,useful tool,A useful book for quick and answers to the simple questions of Outlook 2000. Not too in depth as some might need. Easy to follow layout. Will keep it handy for all quick questions on Outlook!
1,- Sob - -,"I like the reviews I've read, and I adore Ronald Reagan. Would love to have this DVD, but will not buy it because it offers no subtitles. My DVD player can't handle ""close captioned"".Susan"
2,Pale Remake,"One of Ronald Reagan's few starring Westerns was this color remake of Universal's ""Law and Order"" (1932) - the first O.K. Corral movie and a stark masterpiece. Despite a good cast and plenty of action, the 1953 version pales in comparison to the Walter Huston-Harry Carey original (which occasionally shows up on the Encore Westerns channel). A passable time-filler at best."
4,motown challange,"LOVE THE TITLE TUNE (VILLAGE OF LOVE)GREAT DETROIT 60S BAND SOUND. SOME ONE WILL PROBABLY COVER THIS GREAT TUNE,AND IT WILL BE AN EVEN BIGGER HIT!"
5,Smart and funny rock and roll.,"Well worth the bucks. It's smart yet very funny and insightful. John Huss makes you think and rock. You'll find yourself singing these songs to yourself. Buy it. ""Yul"" love it."
2,"This book is about Eiphel, not Design Patterns.",If you want to learn about design patterns - don't buy this book! The most of the book is in Eiphel language which is not so easy do understand. To understand the design patterns with the examples of the book is very difficult. I bought this book because of it stars - but it was my big mistake!
1,not really precision ground,This tool was not useful to me. I laid my Starrett straight edge across it and could rock the straight edge noticeably. Not worth the money. Precision is overstated. Sent it back.
3,Different product than shown.,"The black anodized finish shown in the advertisement that I responded to is no longer supplied. The maker passes off the current, aluminum, surface as an improvement. Regardless of the company's viewpoint, a changed product should be so shown in ads. I would prefer the black finish, others might prefer the current finish. Both buyer types should be informed as to what will be supplied.The plate is noticeably unflat as shown by placing it against a Lee Valley straight edge. This makes determination of saw arbor runout difficult since one must judge whether an indicated runout reflects runout on the plate or on the arbor.I have given a three star rating because some woodworkers may find the precision potential of this product adequate for their needs."
3,Not as accurate as stated,"I was expecting accuracy to ""within + or - 1/1000 . I didn't get it. The plate wasn't flat enough to get those tolerances. The plate is good for lining up an engineering square to check for 90 degree cuts. But that's about all. If you are using a quality dial caliper you quickly see how un-flat it is. I wouldn't mind (I also wouldn't have bought it) if they didn't say it could achieve that kind of accuracy but it can't. I feel you can spend your money on better things. Maybe it would be better to spend three times as much if what you're getting actually works as advertised."
3,Meh,"It was ok, but very sparse on information. Every major battle campaign seemed to only be about 3 paragraphs, so I was left wanting."
1,stay away from this one!,"what you will get is what appears to be an ILLEGAL COPY of the actaul book. my first reaction was to torch it, but i decide to return it just so they can shove it right up their asses. worst on-line shopping experience ever. done whit amazon low standars."
4,bravo bollani,Stefano Bollani deserved to be on the cover in lieu of Rava. There are hundreds of trumpet players that sound identical to Rava. Go for the real thing and go after some old Miles. This album is worth 4 stars for the piano alone.
5,great sturdy player,"owned one for a year.- metal case, well built- plays dvd, svcd, vcd, mp3 no problem.- excellent picture, versatile outputs- runs either on 12VDC (for car, you need to make/buy a plug) or110 AC.- small enough and easy to use in the car. fits in the seatsback pocket, my 5 yr old can turn it on and use it.this is great price, I paid $150 when it was exclusive at target."
1,HORRIBLE,I BOUGHT THIS DVD PLAYER ABOUT A 6 MONTHS AGO AND I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE WITH IT. AT FIRST IT WOULD ONLY EXECPT DVD'S AFTER THE 10TH TIME YOU PUT IT IN. THEN IT WOULD JUST TURN OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE. NOW IT WON'T EVEN TURN ON. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I ALSO BOUGHT IT AT TARGET BUT GAVE IT AS A GIFT TO MY BOYFRIEND AND HE THREW THE BOX AWAY. SO I'M STUCK WITH IT. NOT ONLY THAT BUT PHILIPS DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE MODEL LISTED ON THERE WEBSITE SO YOU CAN'T EVENGET ON-LINE HELP WITH IT.
1,Started out great but...,"Less than two months after receiving my new PHILLIPS DVD player, it is now sitting in my TRASH CAN! The PHILLIPS DVD player refused to eject the dvd, saying there was no disc inside. I called the 1-800 HELP number (YA RIGHT!) which came with my PHILLIPS DVD player for assistance and received NONE other than to offer to tell me where I could go to have my less than 2 month old PHILLIPS DVD player repaired at MY OWN COST! In my opinion, this shows that PHILLIPS does NOT stand behind their products, and this PHILLIPS DVD player was a piece of JUNK! I guess you get what you pay for."
3,NOT FOR USE IN CAR,"Although this DVD palyer is 12v compatible it does not come w/ a 12v car adapter nor can you buy one through Philips. Infact I was told by Philips that it has not been tested for the car and they do not recommend it. This may not be a big issue for some but this why I bought it. Target actually advertises in their store that it can be used in the car. Why else would it be ""12v compatible""."
4,Looking to buy,When I saw the DVD Player in my local Wal-Mart I knew it was the perfect size for what I needed it for. I plan on adding ti to my audio video system in my car and it will fit perfectly under my front seat or mounted under the dash. But when I went back to purchase one they were all gone and I haven't seen one since. To the person that is upset about the volume control you must realize that no dvd or vcr has volume control and at least this one allows you to use one remote if you have a compatible receiver as for me I want be worried about that because my PS 2 that I have in the car doesn't have volume control either so I use the stereo volume control.
5,Know the facts,"I have a small response to the post by andrew-s. A dvd player is not an amp or preamp, if you output your audio from the dvd player, whether it be to a receiver or tv, the device you connect the dvd player to will always be the device that controls the audio. The dvd player is merely a source, not a means to control the audio.I just wanted to leave everyone out there some fact about setting up a home theater system. Make sure you do your research when you are looking at putting together a system, there are magazines and online articles that will make every question you may have crystal clear.As a final note, I have not bought this unit yet, but it is #1 on my to-buy list. The optical audio and component video outputs are the major selling points for me."
5,You get what you pay for!,"This DVD player cost much less than most others. Philips Magnavox is a reputable brand, with quality products. As all companies do, they have LOW END PRODUCTD AS WELL, as to meet the market's demands. Hence the saying, you get what you pay for. Don't let people's reviews (who aren't even reviewing this particular PRODUCT!!) become part of your decision making, on whether or not to purchase this DVD Player. I have one in my kid's room, and for their needs, it's PERFECT. No Problems to date!!! Good Luck!"
4,Wonderful Workshop,"Great sound, very well detailed. Not very durable but a greatChristmas display piece."
3,Kindle textformat problems,"I loved the content of this book, and the way that the author presented the material. I learned a lot. However, I'm normally a fast reader, and the Kindleversion has multitudes of droppedspaces which jam words together making it hard to skimorread.This is especially true of sentences with the period and the first word of the next Sentence.Your eye keepsstopping to figure out the words. This was very distracting, and Iwould have to go back and start a sentence or paragraph over again to follow the thought.Another consequence of this format problem was in making 'Highlights' or Notes of words or phrases or sections. Since words or sentences were jammed together, the highlightornote would start or end in a place that didn't make sense.Again I loved the book, but was verydisappointed with the KindleVersion."
5,Help those who interact with Islamic friends and co-workers,"Timothy George presents fair and balanced description of Islam as well as a informative and effective comparison of the two faiths in this easy-to-read volume.In particular, his focus on the doctrine of the Trinity, will be helpful to those of us who interact with Muslim friends or co-workers. The high light of the text (for me) is the informative and interesting chapter (or two) of Church history which discusses the early church's disputed teaching which led to the solidification of the Doctrine of the Trinity at the Coucil of Nisea (as stated in the Nicean Creed), many of which are the same, or similar, arguments that Muslims have with it.The book is an ""easy read"" considering the depth of the subject matter, enjoyable, pratical, short and to the point. I highly recommend it!"
5,An Epic Spritual Journey,"I'm not LDS either, but they couldn't have done a better casting job! Gorham and Hathaway are perfect for thier roles!The passion and compassion that Gorham brings to the character of John Groberg is timless! This movie gives one a new respect for missionaries regardless of faith. The special features are great too! This is a movie that the whole family can watch over and over. The only thing that disappoints me is the other reviews themsleves; particularly the one from ""Chris in California"" who uses his review as a thoughtles attack on Mormons everywhere. This is America where all faiths should be respected! I'm suprised that Amazon would allow this thoughtless smear to be posted on thier webaite! A shame!"
2,Fairness and propaganda,"I wish that Hollywood producers were as fair to mainstream Christians as they were to Mormons in this movie. I didn't even realize till half way through the movie that the missionary was a Mormon. Naturally the Christians from the ""other church"" on the island were portrayed to be hateful and full of hypocrisy. I'll have to do some research to find out the true facts of this story. I do know the facts about Mormonism and they are anything but mainstream Christians."
2,It was not what I expected,The story is lost between religion and life.I didn't like it very much.It is missing somethingin the middle of the writing the score.
1,Disappointing and misleading!,"Message of the movie: ""Mormons are wonderful. Christians are mean & hateful."" Halfway into the movie I felt insulted and ripped off."
5,It was a breath of CLEAN fresh air!,"I thought this movie was done in perfect taste, and very true to the book, which I have read. It started out a little slow, and maybe even a little cheesy at first, but it was refreshing to know it was a true story....and that real life isn't always non-stop fun and excitement, like we expect all movies to be now. It was a reminder of what really matters in this life....experiences and developing relationships with others. I haven't felt so good and happy after seeing a movie for a long time! Thank you!"
5,Fantastic Movie!,"Although this is about the experiences of an LDS missionary, it could be about anyone dedicated to serving his Church and his fellow men. The story is interesting and the scenery is beautiful. It is a story of faith and courage and dedication to high moral principles -- something that is badly needed in today's world. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking good, clean entertainment. -- This review is based on the motion picture. I am looking forward to getting the DVD."
5,"Great Film, Unfairly treated!",Why is this movie getting such bad press (and such little publicity). It's a great film that deserves to have national popularity for it's inspiration and great story. Why is everyone having a cow over all the new mormon flicks. There are lot's of Cathlic and Jewish flicks all over the place. It's is only natural for Mormon movies to start poping up considering that Their church is now the fifth largest in the nation and spreding fast everywhere in the world. I think the mormons deserve some credit and mutual respect for their belifs. It took the world a long time to warm up to them and discover the truth behind the lies and steryotypes. Now let's just calm down and get to know them. They're great people and I say that the movie is great too.
1,walked out,"Thought it was slickly-produced [production] for the Mormon church, it blew its chance at telling a real story. The lead character is sickly sweet to the point of not seeming human, and what's up with his miracle cures? I agree the overall view towards the native people was insulting, they were treated like children and really the whole mission of the church was to eradicate the native way of life -- which by the way it now exploits at the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu! I had to walk out (though I admit I only went because someone else wanted to go, I didn't really feel I'd get an honest or interesting movie). The scenery was pretty, but that's about it."
1,More Morman Deception!,This film is a Mormon film that hides the fact that it is Mormon until well into the movie. Nowhere in it is Morman theology espoused at all. There is no mention of Joseph Smith or the Book of Mormon. There is nothing on the cover that says it's Mormon. It deceptivly portrays Mormonism as an Evangelical Christian denomination. Why do all the cults have to try and deceive people? Why not just be up front about who they are and what they believe. Stay away from this one!
1,Worst Movie,I thought this movie was the dumbest thing ever made! No wonder it never hit the theaters. All they did was treat sick people on a little island. Someone was either hurt or dying in this movie. And I thought that Anne Hatheway was supposed to be in it more than 10 minutes. And when she was in it all she wore were white outfits. Also I thought this movie was rated PG. I don't have anything against PG or PG-13 movies but they were showing blood gushing out of these guys feet and I thought it was pretty sick. So whoever you are DO NOT get this movie. It's the worst ever. And thank you to whoever is reading this and take my advice.
4,The Other Side of Heaven,"I throughly enjoyed the movie. It was quite faithful to the book. I felt the acting was believable the locations were beautiful. You can't find sunsets like that any where else, but the South Seas. It made me feel good and that's why I go to movies. I want to come away feeling like it was worth the time and money invested and this movie was. Now I need to book a trip to the islands."
5,Absolutely great movie,This story is about a mormon missionary who goes to Tonga to serve the people there. It is a story about how he comes to love the Tongan people. I think people both of the LDS faith as well as people of any other faith will enjoy this film. It is a great family oriented film.
4,I've seen this twice and liked it both times.,"This movie had me riveted and it stuck with me. The acting was very good, it had humor, memorable imagery, touching moments (got teared up a bit, I admit) and a great spirtual message. It's based on the true story of John Grohberg's mission to Tonga, but doesn't appeal only to Mormons, with its Mormon protagonist. The message is universal and there is no uniquely Mormon doctrine to make people of other faiths uncomfortable. It's not recommended for very young kids as some scenes are quite inappropriate for them. I recommend this to anyone who is tired of Hollywood filth and is spiritual."
2,Bitter sweet,"The movie wasn't bad but the best scene for me was about 1/4 of the way in the pale white Idaho missionary asks the Tonga missionary ""What if I don't believe?"" and the Tonga guy says ""then you came a long way for a lie""."
5,GORGEOUS!,"This movie is clean without being sqeaky, sweet without being gooey, and inspiring without being preachy. Basically it's everything you want in a movie (action, adventure, romance, drama) without the bad aftertaste. Plus the scenery and music is GORGEOUS!Do not pass up the chance to see it - over and over.Definitely 5 stars."
5,Excellent true story!,"My entire family loved this movie, even those family members who wouldn't be caught dead watching a film with a ""religious"" or ""inspiring"" theme. Humorous, touching, insightful. A winner!"
3,Book is a Million Times Better,"I had made the mistake of reading the book, In the Eye of the Storm by Groberg, before I saw the movie. The movie only showed some of the crazy things that happened to Elder Groberg on his mission. It left out all of the personal and spiritual growth that he went through and how he came to love the gospel and the people more than himself. The movie was nice, but Disney did not want to insult any of their viewers and left out the most important aspects that made John Groberg's experiences so amazing. The movie was ok, but I highly recommend the book to anyone."
3,Great movie in English,"As wide-spread as the church is and especially being set in a different country, I'm surprised and disappointed my copy didn't have Spanish subtitled or dubbing--only in English! I showed it to a recent convert, and the movie's action was enough that only a small amount of translation was needed. Also, my DVD jacket describes this as an epic adventure but it was a story that was all TRUE! It wasn't just the adventure of somebody's mind behind a typewriter, but for members of our church these are every day experiences for missionaries that are overcome with love, sacrifice and faith in the things we believe! I guess we know that, but others may not. I would recommend this movie to anyone!"
4,The Other Side of Heaven,The movie shows the hardship of missionaires and maintaining their moral values in a country which has entirely different values.
3,Neil Diamond,This was a bit of a disappointment. The performance was okay and pretty much what I expected but I guess I must have evolved out of liking this sort of music. It is music; most of what comes out of the pop world today really can't be called music. Diamond performed professionally and sang well enough especially when compared to what the pop world churns out today. The thrill of live performance was there in spades and that made it worth watching but it's not something I'll watch very often.
2,Pitiful at best,"I have seen Neil Diamond in concert three times. This DVD does him absolutely no justice. The small venue seems to sap the energy out of him. He lacks fire and enthusiasm. It appears that he is just out on the stage singing his songs, just trying to get through the show. I am extremely disappointed with this DVD."
4,Neil Diamond a Legend,"this DVD concert captures all his best works at the time this was recorded(some 20 years ago) but if your a fan like me, his voice and his songs are timeless.....a thumbs-up review"
2,Look for another one,"Great songs, but a waste for DVD technology. The sound is poor, I can't believe it's in 5.1. Not to mention that video quality hasn't met my expectations. Couldn't believe that this was Mr Diamond's best show. If you like him, better buy the Cd (I bet it will sound better). Conclusion: Look for a DVD that takes advantage of technology"
5,"Makes You Sing ""Hallelujah"", ""If You Know What I Mean"".","A mixture of several of his hits. There are some omissions such as ""Be"" (from Jonathan Livingston Seagull) and ""Holly Holy"", but it includes several of my favorites, such as ""America"", ""Sweet Caroline"", ""I Am I Said"", and ""Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show"" (I still wonder if that song is meant to mock Christianity or rather to paint the picture of an old tent revival).I will say that I prefer Diamond's vocals on the Beatles tribute than the original."
3,I WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED IN THE SOUND QUALITY OF THIS DVD.,NEIL DIAMOND'S DVD GREATEST HITS LACK THE PUNCH OF SUPREME DIGITAL SOUND AND FALLS WAY SHORT OF THE MARK. THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE IS GOOD BUT THE SURROUND SOUND IS LESS THAN SPECTACULAR. THIS DVD SHOULD HAVE BEEN REMIXED WITH DOLBY 5.1 TO GIVE THE VIEWER A REAL CONCERT EXPERIENCE.
2,Bit of A Disappointment,"Unfortunately there is not a lot of Neil Diamond available on video. Greatest Hits Live is rather hit and miss. Filmed before a small audience at the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles in 1988 it appears that Diamond was just going through the motions.The performance, while it does include some of his best work, seems oddly disconnected and lifeless. The mix is adequate but nothing special. There are times when the camera cuts to a member of the band and you can't really hear the instrument he is playing.I have seen Mr. Diamond twice before and I know that there are better performances out there. The song selection could have been boosted to add some more of the classics.All in all you need to take what you can get but this DVD is disappointing."
4,"As expected, over his top, but still going strong.","Neil has given us better concerts in his earlier years, but for a real fan this DVD is a must."
3,No lyrics,"While it's nice to find these songs in karaoke, this recording does not include Disney's lyrics (copyright law or something), the original artists do not sing the demo's, and the Beauty and the Beast song is the pop duet, not the music as it was done in the movie."
3,Muggie Maggie,It was about a girl who didn't want to write cursive. Her teacher didn't yell at her for not wanting to learn cursive. She got the job of being the messenger. All of the notes were written in cursive. She finaly found out that her teacher was writting notes about her. so she learned cursive.
4,This book is for 3rd graders but other grades will love it!!,"Dear amazons, this book Muggie Maggie is good because it has a good dialogue& the parts of the story move in an orderly way. I like this book because I am a 3rd grader & I am learning cursive like Maggie. Also other grades will love it.My favorite part is when Maggie gets made fun of but she heals her problems.I enjoyed this book so much but I still would give it 4 stars. Sincerely, Natasha Duell"
2,Doesn't hold decanter securely,"I'm perplexed by the other reviews, or possibly I just have a bad one but I find the tip on the end of this is very slippery and does not function to hold the decanter securely well at all. I had been using it until the other day when you guessed it, the decanter slipped and cracked up it's side as it went. I cannot recommend."
5,Not just for decanters,"I use this for drying anything tall and narrow that I can't get my hand and a towel into, e.g.,1-quart Rubbermaid juice container and vases. Also good for air-drying ziplock bags. I used to use a wine bottle, but the wet bags stuck to the side of the bottle."
5,"...and you thought ""The Lord of the Rings"" was all you needed to know about Irish lore !","This classic Celtic band that preceeded U2 had the imagination and mastery of setting tales to music, and ""The Tain"" by Horslips is a disc that no rock 'n roll enthusiast should ignore. Full of hard driven rock, gentle melodies, and songs that tell a story, this collection could make you roll your eyes and ask yourself how you missed it, thirty plus years ago. It is (roughly) an hour of music that you will enjoy again and again, as if it is a new release. ROCK ON !"
5,Great Historical account,"This was a well-written, easy to read account of a horrible ""battle"". I ordered the book because my husband's grandfather's death was detailed. This is the first time we have really been able to find out what happened and what the battle was about. I do not read war books but I could not put this one down. The description of what went wrong was well done. I can appreciate all of the work that went into putting this together!"
4,Great Book-- but who did the cover?,"This is a well-written, insightful book on one of the most interesting naval battles of World War II. You've got to wonder about the publisher of the paperback edition, though, since the cover has a picture of some Marines making a landing. They sure didn't land on Savo Island, and the battle relates only tangentially to the landings at Guadalcanal. Ignore the cover art and buy the book."
1,Fluidmaster sleazily minimizes its contents in recent years,"I started using this many years ago & each cartridge lasted a good few months with every flush generating a rich blue color until the last application. Then in recent 1-2 years, Fluidmaster sleazily minimized the contents such that each cartridge now gives a rich blue color for only the 1st week. Total lifespan has been decreased to maybe 1 month top. Fluidmaster, I want you to know that I know & I'll tell this to everyone whom I know. You ruined your own great product. If I rated this product a few years back, I'd have given it 5 stars, but due to your irresponsible sleazy act, 1 star is one too many."
2,Good for septic,I really like the idea because we have a septic system but the cartridges don't last as long as they claim. Need to be improved.
2,Fluidmaster 8202 Analysis,"I was so impressed with this toilet bowl cleaner, I bought and sent a kit for every family member (parents @ 5 siblings) about 6 years ago. Keeping the chlorine away from rubber parts in the tank, yet allowing it to only go in to the bowl is a real sign of engineering genious. However, I have noticed that the refills do not last as long and I believe that the manufacturer may have cut costs by reducing the amount of cleanser in each refill cartridge. That's a shame!I admit that I am looking for a competitor with the same identical delivery system that Fluidmaster uses to keep the chlorine out of the tank and delivering it only to the bowl. If any one has a suggestion, I'd like to know the alternatives."
2,"Good Idea, bad cartridge life","Well, after replacing a couple of float valves due to corrosion from bleach tablets, I thought this was a great idea. In fact it is a great idea (I'll give it 2 stars for that), but is not a good product, due to high cost and limited cartridge life.Product claims that it'll work up to 3 months, mine worked about 3 weeks at best. I admit I have an older fixture with a big tank, but 3 weeks, give me a break!I am now looking into whether I can get someone else's tablet to fit into the depleted cartridge. Or maybe just use the tablets and replace the float valve after 5 years (it would be much, much, much cheaper than this approach).- Disappointed"
2,no good,"This product may be good at keeping bacteria growing in your septick tank, But it also grows it in your toilet bowl. It made my toilet more of a mess. If you whant somthing that keeps your toilet clean use there chlorine cartridges as I did and they work. If you need somthing to grow bacteria in your septick tank use RID X. I am a journy leval plumber of more than 12 years trust me I work on lots of toilets and sewer pipes and tanks etc. etc."
4,Not all ERP Implementations are equal,"As a professional who works with enterprise systems that must integrate with ERP systems, I found this book very helpful. The author succinctly defines what the ERP system should be doing for the business and provides a framework to to measure whether the implementation is achieving the desired result."
2,Not good,"Slow-movin' and boring 1977 HBO show put me to sleep.The skit,Popcorn is included here but a shorter version.Was better,longer,and funnier on The Jerry Lewis Telethon he got better and funnier as he aged especially when he did Popcorn am disappointed in this dvd show,could have been so much more."
2,COMEDY DVD,The DVD is from an earlier time. The sound leaves much to be desired as a lot of the dialogue could not be understood. We like Shelly Berman but some of this is just silly!!
3,Tight Fit,I thought this was the answer to my excercise bike but after some tugging it did go on the seat. It was not what I thought it would be.
5,Helped out immensely.,"I recently purchased a gently used Weslo Pursuit U30 Stationary bicycle which came with the worst seat you could imagine. What the heck are these manufacturers thinking? Of course people will stop using the bike after a short while because they are so uncomfortable riding it. The seats are narrow and hard as a rock. And people don't realize they can change out the seat so they just give up and let the bike sit in a corner.This is an excellent product. I also purchased a Cloud-9 Cruiser Gel Saddle (from Amazon - great price), and an adapter kit to attach it to my bike. All well worth the cost.The sheepskin seat cover perfectly complements the gel seat by giving me additional cushioning where it counts and keeps me cooler with less sweating. And since I like to stay on the bike for 30-60 minutes, it is crucial that I am comfortable.I highly recommend both of these products together if you value your exercise regimen, your back, and your butt."
3,Doesn't fit,It seemed like a good product and just what I was looking for but it didn't fit. The size was not in the ad and I assumed that meant it would fit all bikes but I guess not. So be careful because it's not going to go on larger seats.
4,How happy can a fanny be?,"This is close to real but not. My seat already has a gel cusion on it and it still fits, very tightly, but fits. I love it. This seat cover makes my fanny happy as myself and my doxie ride the streets. If you need comfort this is the cover to give you that. No More Sore Fanny."
2,Okay,"Bought it for bike, works but always slips off very annoying. Don't use since I gave away bike due to it being uncomfortable."
3,cover and foam rubber,i was disappointed. it's just a seat cover wit a piece of foam rubber hand-cut from a larger piece. The black hand drawn cutting outline is still on the foam. I'm using the cover and not the foam.
1,Didn't fit and padding isn't great,This does not fit the seat on an Schwinn Airdyne stationary bike. I was pretty disappointed that it didn't fit so I positioned it on the seat and rode it anyway. It squished down almost completely and didn't do a whole lot. The padding condensed right down to nothing (and I'm not overweight). I might look into some kind of a gel next time.
4,Good Product,"Cover seems like a quality cover. It fits my exercise bike perfectly. It could have a bit more padding but all in all, it was a good purchase from Amazon."
1,SEAT COVER,WELL WHEN I RECVD THIS PRODUCT THERE WAS ALOT OF INFO ON HOW THE MATERIAL CAN CAUSE CANCER .... NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM NOT GONNA SIT ON THIS STUFF. JUST THINK WHERE THAT WOULD LEAVE ME LOL ... THINK BEFORE YOU PURCHASE .
1,THIS IS NOT SHEEPSKIN,"This is a manmade product, not sheepskin. Anyone expecting true sheepskin quality and feel will be greatly disappointed. Don't waste your money."
3,Too small but made a great dog toy,"The Imitation Sheepskin Padded Bicycle Seat Cover was a fantastic price but alas was to small for the seat off my exercise bicycle. Even If I removed the foam and used only the cover it just didn't fit. It was too cheap to return so I took out the foam, suffed it with old socks, pulled the drawstring tight and... magic... the perfect dog toy."
3,Does not fit.,"This seat cover feels great, but I can not use it on my bike, because it does not fit. If it did fit , however, I would rate it a 5, because the material is great."
4,It's Comfortable,"If you are looking for an extra bit of comfort for your bike, this will certainly help. Great product at a great price."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,The seat cover is perfect! And the vendor exceeded my expectations in the speed of delivery.
4,Very comfortable seat cover,Seat cover fit perfectly over my beach cruiser seat and is so comfortable. Huge difference than riding with the regular stock seat. Recommend for the price.
1,"Terrible, horrible! Not worth your money!!","I read this book and had a really hard time getting as far as I could into it (I finished two other novels before getting back to this book). I was two or three chapters away from finishing it and I just could not bring myself to wasting my precious time reading something this awful. It has to do with a fat spoiled rotten lady who really has nothing better to do in life but THINK there is something in the basement. The characters were done okay, needed some improvement. Plot sucked, story sucked. I do not recommened this to anyone."
2,"Very interesting story, but the ending didn't make it","This novel had a very good plot and the character's and the events were very realistic. But at the end it seems as though the author gave up and just ended any kind of way. The story hyped you up to the max. Goody Redman, the event with the Pastori's and the bees, the assult, eveything. But when you got to the end it seems as though the author said, ""SIKE!"" and just left you hanging. I believe the author is very creative and I'm sure other works are worth reading, but The Basement should stay in the basement."
2,it should have stayed in the basement!,"Wow - I got this book years ago and just recently picked it up to give it a read. It started out okay ... really ... but after the first 100 pages the plot really begins to unravel. The plot, horrible, no connection for how you got from the beginning to the end. It gets 2 stars from me because I enjoyed the writing style, as a matter of fact, the writing and charcter development was the ONLY thing that got me to the end! My recommendation is to wait for the movie!"
5,superb,The best book on the political economy of India to come out in a generation. LOCKED IN PLACE will become the standard that all other books on industrialization and state building in India.
3,Ballet Dancers will love it - anyone else will NOT,"Yes, I agree with all other reviewers in saying that you MUST have ballet experience to do this ""workout"" - at least 5 years or so of ballet training. It really annoys me when former ballet dancers and ballet teachers think they can sell a video to the general public by calling it a ""workout"" instead of a ballet class...make no mistake, this IS an advanced ballet class. I've been dancing and teaching for almost 20 years and I, personally, like the video, but it should NOT be sold to the public as a workout that anyone can do. If you do not have ballet experience you could risk serious injury trying to follow along with this fast paced class. On the other hand...dancers will love it."
1,Ugh!,"Thank godness I checked this video from the library first. The combinations are long and you need to make sure you memorize them when doing them on the right leg because once you go to the left leg you are on your own. Not only that, I noticed, as the other reviewers, that they show the heads to much and not the legs. (Hello! legs is all ballet is about.)I suggets to either check it out from a library first or borrow it from someone before buying. This video is not for everyone."
1,"Bad Explantions, Poorly Shot Film","Experience is a MUST!!! Also the problem is if you do not want this video to go to waste due to lack of ballet training, it is impossible to follow along due to the poor quality of filming. The camera angles have you looking at the back of a head or bad eyeliner for minutes at a time making it difficult to copy the poses. Save your money!"
2,Keep looking,"I have been a professional dancer for over 18 years, and found this DVD to be impossible to follow (as others have noted).There is very poor cueing. I have a studio set up in my house with a stationary barre. I attempted to follow the instructions, but was continually frustrated upon having to turn around away from my monitor - only to have no vocal cueing. This usually isn't a problem, but the combinations are not particularly easy to follow. One would have to sit and memorize the combinations before actually attempting the DVD.It is impossible to follow proper form (and work up a decent sweat) when one is contantly looking over your shoulder to follow the DVD.Don't waste your money on this DVD. Sign up for a class in your area with a qualified teacher. The money spent will be well-worth the frustration saved.For a DVD touted for restoring wellness, renewal and vitality, it simply served to raise my frustration."
2,Its Okay,I didn't like this video as much as the first. I rented it from Netflix to see if I'd like to buy it. It wasn't my style. I like a more classic ballet feel.
4,Great Customer Service from this company,"The superbar is ""unconditionally guaranteed"". I was a little disappointed when I received it that it was just made of plastic, and I clumsily broke it when I first used it! However I called the mastergage company and they immediately shipped a replacement, no questions asked. Furthermore, they were very helpful with tips and ideas about the alignment of my tablesaw and we spent quite a long time on the phone trying to troubleshoot my problem (which was the reason I purchased this product)."
5,Master gage and super bar,I tuned up my table saw and chop saw using this tool and it's mate the super bar and I could not believe the difference it made. a great tool combination for the price.
2,"Works, but doesn't feel like a quality tool","I used this tool to align the blade on a Grizzly G1023 table saw. I also used the MasterPlate. I have to say that although this tool performs as advertised, the cheap plastic base is pretty lame. I already had a dial indicator with a magnetic base, but I thought the MasterGage would be simpler to use. I was wrong. Assembling the tool is not difficult but involves fooling around with small parts twice: once when taking the tool out and again when putting it back. They at least should have a box that let's you store it assembled."
2,Junk!!!,The sliding bar is cheap plastic and stripped out the first time I attached the dial indicator.
3,there is a better way,"the super bar is not a bad tool but if you have a good miter gage that is well fit to the miter slot on your saw, save your money and buy a cheap AGD group2 dial indicator ($12 to $14) and a ""mightymag"" base($6 to $12) at travers or mscdirect and get a much more useful product for half the cost. the mighty mag base is metal and the dial indicator is probably the same as the chinese one on the super bar. just attach the indicator to the base and stick the base on your miter bar and your set and don't worry the magnet will stick Very firmly to the miter gage but will not induce a strong enough feild to stick to the table. it works really well and you can then use these two tools for a large variety of other setup tasks as well. I do however recomend the master plate it is far superior to testing on a blade. i'll post some pictures of my setup"
2,Almost works,"The concept is good, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. It took a lot of fiddling around to get almost consistent results. There is way too much flex in the plastic body that fits into the miter slot. Trying to get the dial Zeroed was a pain in the rear. With so much body flex I wasn't confident the measurements were accurate. Maybe others have had better luck, but for me, it's outta here on its way back for a refund."
3,Plastic Bar,"Does the job, but kind of flimsy. When combined with master plate (a great tool) this permits accurate alignment of your saw blade with your t-slots. The ""superbar"" that fits into your table's t-slot is plastic and uses adjustment screws to distort the plastic to fit the slot. When sliding the bar along the table's t-slot, the plastic bends and distorts.Does the job, but I'm concerned about the longevity of the tool because of the cheap plastic bar. For the price, a metal bar should have been provided. An indicator gage with a magnet attaching to a miter slider would be easier to use. If you have time to experiment find another solution. If not buy mastergage."
1,What a disappointment!,"Philips is a brand name that years ago was known as setting the industries standards in the audio world! The performance of this DVD player suggests they merely found their way as most other mass produced ""wanna be"" electronic manufacturers and are concerned with profits only!This DVD player played a couple discs fine and then the trouble began.............it progressively got worse; skipping; stopping and not working at all..............regardless what the disc was. Philips has a WONDERFUL exchange policy that can take 48 days. The most prolific thing this player produced when operating was FRUSTRATION!!! Only buy this if you enjoy taking a 10 pound sledge hammer to electronic components!!!!"
5,the best,this dvd is very good because it has good sound quality and it is very good and fast at reading things at fast speeds. And also has never ever frozen in on me
2,Low quality equipment,"I am extremely disappointed with this Progressive-Scan DVD player.I am writing this to keep anyone from making the same mistake Imade being lured into the low price.When watching DVDs, about 1 in 2 of the disks freeze in the middleof watching. I've watched the same disks on other DVD players andnot had the problem. Frequently, I'll have to go to another sceneto continue the move.Besides that problem, I find the system menus slow andcumbersome, and unintuitive. This is obviously a cheaply madeequipment with very little quality."
5,Great games,I really enjoy playing this game and its sequal. I look forward to the release of Westward 3
2,not useful as a wedding shoe,"I bought these hoping to use them as a wedding shoe after the ceremony.They are stiff, uncomfortable, and unattractive. I did not use them. I imagine lots of people thinking they can buy these as a wedding shoe, and then none of those people actually using them. I have a completely unused pair - I'm not sure what to do with them. They're so ugly/uncomfortable that I wouldn't give them to anyone I'm friendly with. I guess I'll drop them off at goodwill or something.If you are thinking of buying this for your wedding, don't. If you do, I'd bet you'll be here after you get them writing a review along the lines of ""I wish I listened to the reviews, but I was hopeful ...."""
2,Not Impressed,"The shoes themselves are really nice. I wish I could wear them. They're too narrow for my somewhat wide feet.In addition to this, they came a week after they should have. I ordered them for my high school Formal, and I made sure to overnight them. I should have got them one or two days before. I had to go buy a pair of shoes to replace them. I would have had to anyways, but if they had gotten here on time, I may have been able to get new shoes before the day of the Formal. I will not be ordering from this company ever again.~Daughter of Carl Wyatt"
4,For what it is - YUM!!!!,"Not a bad treat for what it does not have in it. It is not packed with horrible fats or extra calories. My girlfriends and I enjoy a treat like this with no consequence to diet or blood sugar.True, Godiva it's not....that's a one or two time a year treat and then straight to the workout."
2,Gayle's Miracles,Would never buy these again. When they first came out years ago they were so much bigger. Now they are tiny. Not worth the money for sure.
1,Dark chocolate truffle,"The taste of these truffles is just not good it almost had a chemical taste to them, just my opinion here im sure other people like them just fine, but it just so happened i sent an identical to a friend and reported the same thing"
1,Don't Buy Koolatron,"This item is a piece of junk. I bought the same item in white for use in my office, and under light use, it stopped working after less than two months. Neither Amazon nor the manufacturer is willing to repair this item or refund the $80 that I paid for it. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it, and I encourage you to find another product."
3,Disappointed,"Graphics are impressive, however it seems to me that the load time has gotten longer, so there is more waiting for menus and games to start. The Campus Legend mode is interesting, as you only play your player. However, you cannot control anyone or anything else. So if you make a quarterback, you cannot pick the play on offense, control anyone else, and you just skip defense and special teams. The game is played quicker that way, but I enjoy playing defense and special teams. The Dynasty mode is more in-depth, and recruiting is improved with the ability to search for specific characteristics, locations, etc. One last note, and it's just a preference issue, but I much preferred the playbooks from last year to this year (the overall presentation of picking the plays, not the plays themselves)."
2,WHY THE DOWNGRADE?!!!,THIS GAME WAS A BIG LET-DOWN. YOU CAN'T PUT YOUR PRIME PLAYERS IN CERTAIN SPOTS OF CERTAIN FORMATIONS BECAUSE THE GAME NO LONGER ALLOWS YOU TO FORMATION SUB. THE RECRUITING OPINION IS A LITTLE TO REALISTIC AND TIME CONSUMING. THE PLAYERS AND GRAPHICS ARE GOOD ON PS3 BUT TO ROBOTIC IN CUTS. LAST YEAR'S GRAPHICS SHOULD HAVE STUCK TO THIS YEAR'S BASIC AND NOT DELETED OPTIONS LIKE PICKING AND DESIGNING YOU OWN PLAYBOOK AND FORMATION SUBBING BECAUSE THAT HAS TOOK THE GAME BACK TO THE 01' VERSION INSTEAD OF THE 08' VERSION. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT FOR MADDEN.
4,Same as all the other 'NCAA' games,"If you like them chances are you'll like this too. Pretty fun, but takes a while to get the controls & nuances down....like most other games. I wouldn't pay more then $5 for it now as they are very dated."
4,"Fun game, but where did Create-a-School go???","The gameplay is fun and exciting. The Dynasty mode is a neat way to learn how to recruit new prospects, create new players, keep up with the demands of being a coach and managing your team throughout the years and trying to accomplish contract goals or face getting fired! The last NCAA football game I had was '05 and the '08 version failed by not having the create a school option. How could EA Sports take away create a school??? Otherwise the minigames are fun- option dash (2 minutes to go about 80 yards and score as many times as you can by only using option plays, bowling- play from 10 yard line and you get two shots per sequence and 10 frames, and tug-of-war allows two teams to go back and forth one play at a time to see who scores first)If this game had create a school, it would be five stars! I think I will be purchasing 10 or may be NCAA 11. I bought the '08 version last year."
4,A Pretty Nice NCAA Game!,"This is a pretty good game(about 4.5 stars), definitely an improvement from the 07 version. The graphics and sound f/x are AWESOME! It's like you're really in the stadium getting cheered on or booed by the fans. Gameplay is a little laggier (but also more realistic) than the past NCAA games and the players seem slow and chunky, but overall it's a pretty down right fun game to play by yourself or with a friend."
4,"good game, has its fautls, but overall is worth it.","Are you a college football fan? Then buy the game. Just a football fan? Then you might want to rent it.The game isn't bad at all. The graphics are nicer, the movement is great (60 FPS), and the gameplay is improved. However the game certainly feels like it is missing something, but it is MUCH better than 07 for the 360, but compared to the last generation's version it is really lacking in features. No create a team, no playoff subdivision teams, and it is even missing the newest bowl subdivision team Western Kentucky (unforgivable seeings how they got FIU and FAU in on the correct year... it would be equal to them leaving out one of the bowl games in my opinion).To top off the faults there is no cooperative in this game.If you can get by the faults and just enjoy it for what it is, it is certainly worth the buy."
2,Slow,"My major issue with this game is the lagging of the gameplay as well as the announcing. It seemed it took a quarter of a second too long to switch between players on defense, which of course can cause undesired results. The gameplay was akward as well especially on defense. I found playing on the defensive line was nearly impossible. I could never get any pressure on the QB. The graphics are out of this world and the game is very nice to look at overall. The football aesthetics is aplenty but the gameplay needs to be fun in order to have a good game. I found the gameplay and the lagging was too much to overcome. I sold the game and have not looked back."
2,Almost there,"This year's game is a step ahead from last year's...except for in one (and the largest i.m.o.) category - fps. The gameplay is so slow a lot of times, imagine the worst lag you've had playing online in Madden or any shooter game; that's what normal off-line gameplay is like on ncaa '08. If you played last year's title, the offline lag is worse this year...Other than that - it's a great game and EA is almost there in terms of a great game. The graphics are wonderful, the gametypes are extremely fun (""You decide to veg out on the couch and watch movies with friends...Popularity +1""), and the achievements are a little more challenging this year (getting six interceptions with one player in one game....grrr).Overall, it's a fun game to rent and play for a weekend when you have nothing to do, but I wouldn't buy it...next year's should be the one to put the series over the top."
2,Big Disappointment,"What a huge disappointment! I was really expecting big improvements in graphics and gameplay but was really let down this time. Seems EA is going backwards in the NCAA series. Not impressed at all with graphics, gameplay, AI or overall smoothness. I have heard that the PS3 version is 200% better, how can this be EA?"
3,"No More Big Offensive Numbers, Lots of Turnovers","If your someone like me, who really enjoys putting up 30+ points a game and lots of yards then this game is not for you. You cant go one game without committing numerous turnovers, and running the ball is almost impossible because the CPU will ""jump the snap"" one every three plays. You'll only have 3 seconds to throw the ball or your sacked (regardless of how good your o-line is or who your playing) because no one will pick up the blitz, and its hard to not throw a bunch of interceptions. I guess in a way it is more realistic, but it takes the fun out of the game.As far as graphics and features are concerned this game is phenomenal! The graphics are very smooth and the gang tackling makes a bigger difference than you think. Campus Legand is pretty cool and the recruiting process is much deeper.Overall, awesome features but very frustrating game play."
1,What in the world?,It seems as though the ea people just loadedup the old sega genesis version of madden and gave it better graphics and college teams. The gameplay is terrible and the camera view is ridiculous. I thought that I was plaing in retro mode or something but I was wrong. What happened to the 06 gameplay? Either the creators of this game were on an acid trip up until the last week they had to create the game or they are tryng to boost the sales of Madden. Possibly even just seeing how crappy they can make the game and see how many people will get suckered into it.Well anywayz it sucks completely. extremely dissapointed. There Rant over
2,Fun but very flawed.,"I'd like to add my voice to those who have voiced frustration with this game. My copy is flawed and freezes fairly often, which is apparently a pretty common problem with this game. In addition, the recruiting in dynasty mode is TOO detailed and time consuming. Recruiting used to be one of my favorite parts of dynasty mode, but it simply takes way too much time now. What else? I'm playing Campus Legend with a QB, and I get sacked an average of five or six times a game. The line is utter crap on pass blocking. Those would be my main complaints. At this rate, I'm not going to buy the game again next year. The improvements made each year are minimal and there are quite a few things that have gotten worse."
3,Not What You Have Played In The Past!!!,"Hey NCAA Football fans! If you liked making YOUR OWN TEAM AND STADIUM, if you liked making YOUR OWN PLAY BOOK, if you liked taking A DIV. II TEAM AND MAKING IT INTO A POWERHOUSE, then this game is not for you because you CAN'T DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS! I have to admit, as a long time player of the NCAA series, I was looking forward to all those things AND increased graphics, what I got was a gutted game for the sake of graphics and now I am thinking of hooking up the old XBox just to have the old NCAA back! Maybe the game will grow on me, but I am disappointed with this years version and hope they add all that stuff back in for '09."
4,Ok game,"This game is just a basic football game. If you just want to play and don't care who the players are, this game is for you."
2,good but always can be better,"For one, this game used to be my favorite game on regular xbox UNTIL I went out and bought a xbox 360. I then purchased ncaa 07.....hated it. Then played ncaa football 08. Also hated it. Mainly because EVERY single year EA sports will change the controls to TRY and make something different. I completely stopped playing it after the 07 version on xbox 360. The controls were confusing and everything i liked about audibling, shifting lineman, shifting wide receivers changed to a completely different button. Also I learned I had to press 2-3 different buttons to scroll through the menu while on the roster!!!!! What the hell! KEEP THE CONTROLS THE SAME FOR GOD SAKES! STOP CHANGING THEM. PEOPLE WANT THE SAME CONTROL OPTIONS PEOPLE! MAKE THE GAME PLAY MORE REALISTIC WITH BETTER NON GEEKY SPRINTING STYLES, MAKE BETTER CHAMPIONSHIP CELEBRATIONS!!! BETTER COMMENTATING! GOOD GOD!"
1,seemed like such a good idea for vacation--wasted money,"The adhesive on these is worthless and they just come right off even when we tried adding supplementary tape and have no absorbancy. Seemed like a great idea for travel especially since we have a super drooler and are changing bibs almost every hour. Got the smaller size based on the reviews, maybe the larger ones would have been better???"
3,they have their uses,"The idea is great, but my twins learned to pull them off so quickly that we never finished the first box. They are held on by a velcro patch, and it didn't hold up to my nine month old babies. We can't use regular bibs with velcro either - only ties."
4,Big time saver,"Good product, the only problem is sometimes stickies will not hold. but I highly recomend this item if your baby is on solids already. Big time saver for busy mom."
2,"Com-Stock image of Rachel, not an endorsement.","FYI, straight from her mouth, this is an older ComStock image of Rachel Brice--she has never heard of this CD.It is decent enough of a CD if you like straight recordings, but these standard pieces are not performing with life, any dissimilation from the notes on the page, or any other mark that would differentiate them from the 19,000 versions out there of each of these songs.If you are a beginner dancer and want to learn about the basic bellydance songs you will hear over and over again, this is a decent place to start. However, if you have exposure to Middle Eastern music, wish to perform with these pieces, or want something played with zest, it would be best to look at George Abdo, Hossam Ramzy, Phil Thornton, etc. These classics are also easily found on iTunes, and you can sample the variety of each song, choosing one that best suits your own style and taste."
3,Good Homeschool Resource ( as a supplement),"I purchased this workbook to use with my son (age 13) to supplement our home school curriculum. I speak French fluently - so that helps - as this book really covers a lot of ground. I think it could be used for at least two years - not just the ""first"" year. I especially like the cultural, geographical and historical chapters in the back. For the money - I think it is a good deal. But be forewarned, it is NOT a textbook. Ideally you should also use something like Rosetta Stone and lots of library materials as well."
4,No Answers in Back of Book!,"I bought the book to supplement my semi-private French lessons. I love doing all the exercises and having to look up words in order to understand the questions - that's what makes it a great memorizing tool. Call me old (I'm 61), but I want to check my answers - there are NO ANSWERS in the back of the book. I find that very frustrating!"
3,B.G,"well this b.g is ok and tight.it depends on the songs. Some the beats are tight just like how cashmoney brings it. i gave it 3 but you would have to judge for yourself, cause i was a little disappointed but the cd aint garbage. I still feel like nolimit records makes the best music from new orleans. Peace"
1,WHAT WAS HE THINING?!,"B.G. HAS NOW GONE TOO COMMERCIAL FOR ME. THERE ONCE WAS A TIME WHEN I THOUGHT HE'D BE THE ONLY CA$H MONEY MEMEBER NOT TO SELL OUT, I GUESS I WAS DEAD WRONG! IF IT WAST FOR ""I KNOW"" THIS ALBUM WOULD HAVE GOTTEN NO STARS!! THIS S#@T SUCKS. BUT DON'T TAKE DIGGA'S WORD FOR IT."
3,B.G HAS LOST IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"FIRST OF ALL I AM BIG FAN OF CASHMONEY, BUT THIS CD IS PIIFUL ITS A FEW SONG THAT I CAN STAND LISTENING 2, SO I WOULD ADVISE THAT U DON'T GET THIS CD. THIS CD IS NO WHERE NEAR CHOPPER CITY IN THE GHETTO THAT CAME OUT LAST MARCH . THE BEATS R TIGHT THOUGH THAT MAKES THE CD BEARABLE. SO 4 ALL THEM ""CASHMONEY"" FANS SAVE YOUR ""CASMONEY"" 4 ANOTHER CD"
2,BG falls short,"I consider myself a fan of Cash Money. They don't seem to release any albums that you can really listen to all the way through and be thoroughly satisfied (more Mannie Fresh, damnit). BG's newest release ""Checkmate"" falls short in my book. The best track is ""Hennessey & XTC"" featuring Big Tymers. You'll get the hook stuck in your head for days. Aside from that track, the album just didn't cut it for me. You might also check out track 7, ""Change the World,"" which also has some redeeming quality. Maybe they'll have better luck with Lil Wayne's new one, ""Lights Out""."
3,its pretty tight,THE TRUTH IS THIS CD ANT SPECTACULAR LIKE EVERYONE EXPECTED FROM B.G. IT STARTS OFF TIGHT WITH THE FIRST THREE SONGS THEN IT FADES. THE TYMA TALKING IS OK WHEN FRESH GETS ON DEM HOES. THERE IS ONLY 3-4 SONGS WIT TIGHT BEATS THAT STAND OUT. HE DOES A SLOW SONG WHICH IS ALRIGHT CAUSE HE HEADBUSTIN IN IT. THE ONE CALLED CHANGE THE WORLD IS STUPID CAUSE THE LYRICS ARE SO SIMPLE. HENNACY&EXTACY KINDA TIGHT WIT FRESH SINGING THE HOOK. THE SONG PROBLEMS IS PRETTY TIGHT WITH A BEAT THAT FITS IN GOOD. IT ANT DISSAPOINTING SO OVERALL YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND COP IT.
4,Great video for a snowy day,I bought a series of sunrise videos and this one was very good but not super. I have been to Alaska andI have seen more spectacular sunrise colors. I would still recommend it to others
4,social chess for groups,"As fun as this game is there is a terrible imbalance in 3 player games. My friends and i corrected this by having the fourth army put in as a NEUTRAL army controlled by the other players. At the end of round one player one (the player who went first) moves for neutral, then in round 2 player 2 plays neutral etc, Neutral is ""last"" in play order so it should be positioned as such with play going to the left, it makes the game much less unfair for the player who gets stuck between the other 2 and players can use the neutral army to attack each other! I could not give the product five stars because THEY should have thought of this rule and included it in the rules and they did not."
4,Great gift for Chess Lovers,My son is 14 and they played this after school as a club. At this age it is difficult to find a nice gift at a reasonable price. This was the perfect item.
5,Brings back memories,"I played this game alot back in college, 15 years ago. We had single player and team tournaments, which were fantastic. I must admit that I often won but I probably had more standard chess experience then others. I developed a ridiculous opening to beat any player next to me within three to six moves. With slight modifications, I could even hide it from others who expected it. The very soul of competitive chess tournaments. Yes, some games do take time but in college dorms where most of your free time might be spent confined together, time is rarely a factor. Great for families too including those extended holiday get-togethers."
5,chess 4,My son has really enjoyed playing this game with his classmates and teachers. It is a good product and i am satisfied with it
2,"love concept, peices missing!",I like the idea. It is a cut throat blood bath.... except the end can drag on for quite some time. With that said I would of given this product 5 stars is the pieces were all there. I was missing 4 peices from 2 different sets which I used corks and model clay to make this missing pieces.... disappointed.
2,"Cute, but not worth the money.","These are cute little fridges if you don't want to use them all the time. They cannot be plugged in days on end, the cord breaks or the motor goes out and the parts are expensive to replace. If you want something that gives you longevity go for a regular compact fridge which do not cost much more than the Koolatron items."
1,Is not built to last,Bought this item from Target and it stopped cooling before I even the one year date of the purchase. It is not meant for the long haul.
1,Don't waste your time or money!!,"The rocks came very fast, that's the only good part. After i washed the rocks and put them in my fish tank, it started to lose color in a week. Not safe for the fishes and just waste of money.. Just go to pet store"
2,Highly overpriced,"At time of purchase, I did not know the rule of thumb, that you need one pound of gravel per gallon of tank. So, when I realized I was still four pounds short, I bought more from petsmart. There, I paid less for four pounds than I did here for one. I had no idea that there were such differences..."
2,Not Vibrant,"The color is much paler than I thought it would be, but the stones are smooth and seem good for my new Betta fish. There is enough for the 1 gallon tank that I have because it is more narrow than wide, but the bag is smaller than you would expect. I would have been happier if the color had been more like the picture. It already looks faded and pale. I wouldn't have bought this product if I had known that the color would be so different."
3,Not light blue,The color i got is not what is depicted in the photo. It's not a light aqua but rather a dark navy. The product number matches up so maybe someone mislabeled all of these particular bags. Not really what I was looking for but I'll use it anyway.
3,Not for Beginners,"Hans Bertens' comprehensive analysis of the core literary theories is a good tool for those who are already familiar with the methods and issues involving poststructuralism, New Criticism, Marxism, etc. and would like more of an advanced philosophical analysis of the schools of criticism. But if you are new to the subject, I would suggest finding an easier read. Throughout the his analyses, Bertens' text is vague to a considerable degree and he has a habit of jumping all over the place. This may produce more difficulty for those who are new to this area of literature and who need a concrete, upfront foundation in the various theoretical methods. To make matters worse, the text was written with the European/British student in mind, so the language may be more difficult to grasp."
3,Good Explanations but So-So Writing,"Bertens did a good job in explaining and demonstrating with examples the main points of the various literary approaches and other related topics, like in the discussion of language as an arbitary system of signs, he showed how -- in theory -- the word ""nerd"" acquired its meaning. However, there are many typos and the writing is inconsistent. Moreover, wordiness leads to many confusions. I suggest that, before you go into a chapter, read the summary, which is more accessible, to get a feel of the topic."
4,Very powerful,I had watched Reverend Sewell's documentary Raw Faith and wanted to see what her writings would reveal. These are some of her earlier writings and I enjoyed reading them.
4,"It was a great book, however the ending was disappointing.","I read the Great Gatsby for a school paper. I am writing a paper containing my opinion, and other critical reviews on the book. I am having great trouble. I thought the book was good. I found several instances of imagery, and the plot was good. I sometimes found it confusing, however when I read it over again, I understood it more. Also, the movie helps. After reading the book however, I found several questions unanswered. Maybe I just can't pick up on them, but I felt the book was unanswered. I recommend this book to read, just for pleasure. I wouldn't recommend reading it for school. However, I would greatly recommend A Prayer For Owen Meany."
2,Colour not as pictured,"I was not thrilled with this wrap. The colour is much more muted, quite dull actually and I did not feel it was worth the price. I bought it for a particular evening and did not use it. I was disappointed and thought it would be more evening wear glamourous than it is."
1,Horrible Quality,"As a veteran woodworker/woodworking teacher I have the opportunity to work with a wide variety of equipment for personal/professional use. The Irwin Band Clamp is without a doubt the worst quality for a band clamp I have ever wasted my money on. I would have given it a zero star rating if it was a choice on the scale. The ratcheting mechanism is reversed from what is found on all other band clamps, which makes for very awkward clamping/releasing. The 'bite' of the teeth on one of my ratchets is horrible, constantly slipping once maximum clamping pressure is reached. I would not recommend the purchase of this item!!!! This item will end up in my box for the next yard sale."
5,Surprisingly Tasty,"I wanted to try a recipe which called for Nutritional Yeast - something I had never heard of before. I did a little research to find out more about nutritional yeast and I was intrigued. It is very tasty. I sprinkle it on my fruit breakfast every morning. I have used it in soups, sprinkled on vegetables, on pasta. It adds a unique flavor, which I like very much. I have to trick my boyfriend into eating well and this is a great way to add Vitamin B12 to any dish."
1,Berry Farms,"I ordered Nutritional yeast from Berry Farms. Order was supposed to be shipped within 24 hours, however, it took 4 days for them to even start to ship it...This is unacceptable in my opinion especially since this was an in stock item. As I am still waiting for product to arrive though its been 12 days I can not tell you how good the product is. Will not order from this company again no matter how good the product is.."
2,TOO Expensive,"too high a price for the quantity; even though it said 8 oz., when the package came, I was surprised at how small it was"
5,"If you haven't found Vegetarian, then do, and this product.","I converted to a plant based diet almost a year ago. I was searching for spices, meals, etc on line, where I found a tofu scramble, with nuturtional yeast, I ordered this and have prepared this tofu scramble each morning since: 2 egg whites,tofu, soft is better, kale or spinach, goat cheese, tumeric, nutritional yeast, gound pepper, red or green peppers, onions,can add anything else , mushrooms etc. I prepare a meat free saugage, and wha la, I am one happy camper. I would never go back to fast food or meats. My blood work shocks my physician, all my critical heart health numbers are superb. And I really believe the tumeric has helped me become joint pain free. I will be 65 this year, and have never felt better since my 20's and 30's."
5,Great product.,"I just got this today. I am trying to greatly increase my nutrition due to heath problems, and gave up meat because of the cruelty, which I simply cannot participate in. Put some in my drink and it tasted fine. Has a mild smell and taste. I also read that cats like it so put some out in a bowl; they loved it! I will order this again and continue to use it for the health benefits; may also sneak some into my husband and son's food, don't tell them!"
4,Fitzroger is imminently suitable,"Demaris is hard to like at first. She's spoiled and selfish. But Fitzroger is marvelous from beginning to end and absolutely makes this book. He's glorious. Without him, Demaris would never have become a heroine the reader could like. She does, slowly, but it's almost all his doing.The intrigue is well done, as always for Beverley. I have to say, though, that I wasn't crazy about Ashart. I have not read Winter Fire, so I might feel differently if I had, though I like Genova and Rothgar here.If I liked Demaris better, I'd rate it 5 stars, so let's make it 4 & 1/2."
1,"same old, same old","If you liked Jo Beverley's previous Malloren books, you'll probably like this one. If not, you won't. Seems to me they're getting interchangeable. This one lacks life and originality."
5,A Beverley best,"The young woman has the money, the young man has none--but there is more to him than the surface would indicate. This is akeeper."
4,"""A Most SUITABLE Man"" very good historical romance","""A Most Unsuitable Man"" is highly suitable to me. This Georgian Romance is entertaining and enjoyable. The love story is very good and interesting. It is a very clean romance. But that being said it also has some heat. Just the clean kind of heat. It has a wonderful historical feel to it I really enjoyed.I fell in love with ""The Unsuitable Man"". If you read this story, I hope you do too! Recommended and a keeper! Enjoy!Grade: B+"
2,A disappointment,"Although I am a huge fan of Jo Beverly, this was a disappointment. It is very hard to identify Damaris' finer qualities and start to care about her, so one wonders why Fitz would care. Also, although certainly anyone who reads romance novels cannot be a prude, it does seem a little strange--dare I say forward?--the way Damaris throws herself at Fitz and starts kissing him hotly every time they are alone. Ashart and Genova also seem to take over the book quite a bit. And yet one more quibble--Damaris' family situation turns out to be so bizarre that it just beggars belief (although the Trayce family mystery is quite fun). All in all, not one of Beverly's best."
3,"Yiddish Humor, Jewish Humor Myron Cohen 1950's 1960's","I really got it for my step father. If you like Myron Cohen, & enjoyed him on stage & in the mountains. You will like the DVD."
3,Myron Cohen DVD,The quality of the picture is poor. The introduction by Steve Allen is too long. Myron Cohen's performance was excellent and was to the level I expected.
3,Unbelievable...,"... that neither this disk nor the 'Revisited' one contain the joke I wanted to see and hear Myron tell again, the one joke that inspired me to buy both DVD's, the joke often voted 'the greatest joke of all time,' the one whose punchline is 'He had a hat'. This joke has to be seen and heard in its extended version, and cannot be appreciated in print.I agree with others that the video quality is not that great, and that this 2005 performance isn't quite up to his performances of old. Still, the man is a treasure and a reminder of a time of more gentle humor."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this as a present for my mother's 90th birthday and we were pretty disappointed. too much time with Steve Allen and not enough with Myron who was not at the topnof his game,,at least as we remembered him. He looked like a sleazy used car salesman!"
3,stopped working after 5 months,The warranty for this item is only 90 days. It is not posted on Amazon.com. I found this information out by calling Koolatron. I recommend buying directly from Koolatron and getting the extended warranty. It seems these types of refrigerators are not meant to be on for long periods of time. I suggest turning it off sometimes or buying a regular mini fridge that is meant to be on all the time. It's only a few bucks more and worth it.
1,Received defective product,"Pictured above you see a 20-pack of Gilette Mach3 Razors--at a price that seems too good to be true. What I received were four five-packs looking not completely like what I see in stores. But the real surprise was that they ACTUALLY DIDN'T WORK! How can a razor not actually work? Well, these razors (I tried a few)couldn't cut whiskers that had just been softened in the shower; and they tugged and tore at my skin. Completely different from the smooth, fast cut you get from normal store-bought Mach3 razors. I don't know what's up--if I got examples from a bad lot, or what. But it was my first time using Amazon for personal care items and I think I see the handwriting on the wall...why bother."
