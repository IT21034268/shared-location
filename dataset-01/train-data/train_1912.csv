3,"Exciting beginning, boring ending","This book was kinda boring at the beginning, but then when Lila's party started it got better. And when all the ""scary"" events started happening at the party, it was really exciting even if it wasn't really as scary as I would've liked. The girl who kept calling Lila should not have been who she was, and I think the ending totally stunk. It was so boring, and the explanation for all the missing people and everything was so stupid. It was not scary at all. I would not recommend this book becuase it might discourage Sweet Valley lovers. I would not have bought it if I had read it already."
3,"very creepy, but terrible ending...","Up until the last two or three chapters, I really liked the book. It was the creepiest SVU Thriller I've read yet! Even so, I thought the ending was very, very poorly done. I recommend checking it out of your local library."
2,Killer Party,"I thought this was one of the worst horror SVU novels. Boring, centering around Lila, it follows Lila's New Years party...but her guests keep disappearing, and soon she is stalked inside her own home. Has a ludicrous ending."
3,pretty good until end,"the beginning was scary, but when you find out about what happened, it was really dumb. Personally, I think Lila shouldn't have forgivin ANYBODY!"
3,It was ok,"This book was really intense up to the last few pages when you figured out who did it. It was kinda dissapointing but hey, Francine couldn't have killed off everybody except Chloe! Speaking of Chloe, I wonder if shes still in that tree...."
2,Disappointing end!,"In the beginning it was kinda boring, but as someone else wrote, it got better once the party started. I couldn't understand who the killer was and I kept reading and reading just to find out. I got really disappointed when I came to the end! This is the worst of all the SVU Thrillers I've read. If it is the first SVU Thriller you read, don't think teh other are as bad as this, cuz they're NOT!"
4,Sequels and Interlinked books,"I wish authors would get their publishers to note on the books or at least in the synopsis if this is book 1, 2, or 3 in a series. Although, each is a stand alone, Untamed Hearts, Scandals and Betrayal are a trilogy with The Rake, The Rebel and A Rogue's Seduction linked to the former. I wish I had known this before and read the books in order."
2,Does not work for me,"I will admit that this one eyed, small, magnifying mirror, is very difficult to use. I am sorry I did not read all the reviews more closely as I may have bought a more expensive but larger mirror. For me this was a waste of money."
2,big eyes,"i had to rate this 2 , it somehow made it to my house without breaking, it was packed to the breaking point and only to find out for 30 dollars all plastic , it really should cost a mer 8 dollars not to mention shipping,"
4,bought this as a gift,my mother in law swears this is the only mirror that helps her see to get her make up on just right.
5,Back In Focus!,"This mirror is absolutely amazing!Those of us with older eyes, especially those of us who wear glasses; will appreciate being able to actually see our face again with eyes of a teenager through this mirror.This is the second Magic Focus I have purchased for my mother as she has worn out the first. Oh, not the mirror itself but the base as she carts it everywhere!I almost kept this one!Great product! They even offer a compact. However, for travel, the stand on this one is a must."
5,Couldn't live without it,"I wear reading glasses and I couldn't put on makeup without this mirror. As I get older, I need this mirror more and more."
5,Big Eyes Mirror,Love the Magic Focus Big Eyes Standing Vanity Mirror. I couldn't get ready for the day without it. I bought 2.....one for house and one for travel.Barbara
5,Great magnifying mirror,"My mother has had one of these mirrors for years, every one in the family used it. They are great for other things besides makeup, I use mine to trim up my moustache now that my eyes are not what they used to be."
5,just as advertised,"This was a gift. It is hard to find, but was exactly as advertised and much appreciated."
5,Good Mirror,"I had a Magic Mirror for many years. The flexible neck wore out andI ordered a new mirror. Obviously, I love this mirror for makeup andface checking."
1,broke apart immediately,"I bought three of these- one for myself, one for each of my daughters - and ALL of them broke within 1 week.TERRIBLY MADE PRODUCT.Very pretty, very disappointing."
3,Difficult to clasp bracelet.,"The amethyst nugget silver Bali bead bracelet is quite attractive, but it was difficultto fasten on the recipient, who has a small wrist."
4,A Good Book,In This Comic They Meet Skut An Esthonain That Helped Them Complete This Adventure . Abdullah Also Returns In This Comic (See The Land Of Black Gold ) Quite A Good Book .
5,One of the best adventures of Tintin & Captain Haddock,"I am a very big fan of Tintin books and have been reading them since I was 10 years. No matter how many times I have read them, I can read them again and again. I bought the entire collection for my daughter and I am glad that she likes them as well.This adventure is one of the best where captain Haddock's humour and experience blends with Tintin's braveness in tacking the reader through the book without a dull moment."
4,Interesting title change,"One curious thing about this book is that it is one of the few Tintin books whose original title (in the French edition) is in English: ""Coke in Stock"", a reference to the modern slave trade, I believe; but for some strange reason the title was changed for the English-language edition., to ""Red Sea Sharks""...I wonder why?"
5,great tintin adventure,"This Tintin has many recurring places and characters, including Dawson, who has not been featured since The Blue Lotus. Full of adventure, plot, and humor, this is a must-read for all Tintin fans. Thompson and Thomson fulfill their roles as comic relief brilliantly in this one."
5,One of the most compelling in the series,"This installment in the series was superb. Political intrigue combined with a strong sense of uncertainty and action make it a very enjoyable read for adults and children. Herge leaves behind much of the miraculous coincidence that populates some of his other books and instead drafts a believable and complex (for Tintin) story that holds reader interest,"
3,Not too impressed,This book is a compilation of bridal bouquets. To be honest you are much better off getting your floral inspiration from many beautiful websites that were done by talented floral designers. Luckily I bought it with my points so I didn't really waste my money.
4,Wedding Bouquets,"I love this little book! I am a Wedding & Event Florist and I use this book when I consult with clients. It's packed with great bouquet examples, beautiful crisp pictures, and it gives my clients the chance to observe colors in flower combinations that they never would have originally put together!"
3,Wedding Bouquets -- Over 300 Designs for every bride,"The photos are excellent but the specifics are poor. As a florist, I wanted to know the exact name of each rose color, and would have liked the botanical name of the flowers as well. Although the editorial review says there are price indicators, I have not found them & have read every page. This would have been helpful info, too. A side view of each bouquet would be informative also. The ""language of flowers"" info is repetitive and could have been listed in a table at the back of the book. And I've never had a bride pick her flowers based on their meaning anyway. But it's a good book to show brides for ideas."
3,Great Pictures,If you are looking for pictures of bouquets this is the book for you. Watch out though. This book is a compilation of bouquets from a popular wedding magazine produced in the UK and they often use the true botanical name instead of the common flower names as we know them. No instruction but they do list the style of bouquet and flowers in them. Great to get ideas from.
4,Good for color ideas,This is a great little book to help you get ideas on colors and different types of flowers for your wedding. It's current and gives you just enough information.
2,i think Page was still on herion when he recorded this...,"this was a sad time for Page. i dont know what was going on with the guy then, but his playing is, simply..bland. out of focus, and simply boring(with the exception of the guitar solo on ""Free To Live"", with is quite beautiful and stuble).Keep in mind, this came out AFTER the secret Zepp rehersals after Live-Aid. Is there any question why Plant did'nt wanna squeeze his lemon again?Damn, i could go on for days about how unfocused The Firm were, but ill touch on the positives...Paul Rodgers, tho stiff as usual, sounds great, the rythm section of Tony Franklin and Chris Slade, while thier potential should have been explored by Page more deeply, are rock solid. I simply blame Page for this version of Presence II....NOTE...if you can find live versions of these songs, youll be much more satisifed, as Page, no matter his condition, kicks ass live."
5,IT ALWAYS GETS BETTER,"This album is better than the first, don't get me wrong, the first one was great but this one sounds more like LED ZEPPLIN used to and BAD COMPANY did near the end of PAUL ROGERS time with the band. All the Kings Horses, was one of the coolest songs I had ever heard at the time. If you don't have it, you should get it... life's not the same otherwise."
3,"Good, but no where near perfect","The Firm returned for their second and final go, and its what the doctor ordered. A slightly softer rock album perfect for kicking back and absorbing. The first album was awesome from start to finish, however you may find yourself skipping a few tracks in this one. I recommend the debut CD far over this one."
3,Completely spent ?^ from two of the best?,"Is it true? Two of the best rockers ever..spent out of ideas and great lics and lyrics and songs? Yes i,m afraid so..this second album shows why their was not a third. More misses than good songs here almost not worth the purchase. I mean most songs go nowhere and yes two do rock... and the over-produced ""spirit of love"" is moveing but seems out of place.Wow i want to like these songs so much have a great respect for their prior bands but i can only program a 4 song 19 minute set and that has one filler!! I only really like three out of 8 songs.Its sad what might have been.. maybe..like a sqeezed orange..just out of juice!!!"
4,TREMENDOUSLY UNDERRATED,"For anyone suffering Led Zep (or Bad Co.) withdrawal symptoms in the mid 80s, the Firm wasn't quite the answer, but upon repeated listening - Mean Business is probably Jimmy Page's best post-Zep effort. Punchy yet atmospheric with the bluesy vocals of Paul Rodgers, I do admire how these guys actually tried to produce a pretty serious album - and in spite of less than a stellar response - this album stands the test of time. Page would later play some of these tracks live - ""Tear Down the Walls"" is particularly nice. And ""Fortune Hunter"" rocks. A progressive album that is underrated and worth exploring."
4,Thick and Rich,"This set is somewhat different than The Firm. Here you will find a thick and rich cords and a somewhat slower ""mood"" here. I particularly liked ""Cadillac"" which is bluesy, almost progressive in a sence. I like the rework of ""Live In Peace"" which you will find on ""Cut Loose"" by Paul Rodgers. I think the solo on ""Live in Peace"" is Pages best since ""Stairway""...please withold the stones! The set ends with a ""spiritual"" called ""Spirit Of Love"". I don't find a bad song on this set. It's a real shame these guys didn't record on last cd."
4,Not as good as the first one.,"A supergroup for sure. Swan swan label mates, Jimmy Page from the mighty Zeppelin and Paul Rodgers, one of the premier voices in rock from Free and Bad Company. It's worth buying just for the song ""live in Peace"" which was also on Paul Rodgers 1983 solo album. Really wasn't as good as their first cd, but not bad. For whatever reason this group never took off, of course I would consider it more of a project. Good buy for the price. This release seemed to fade away not very long after it was released."
5,Exciting and well written,Let Me Tell You How I died was a thrilling and very good book to read. Leaving you hanging at every chapter made me read on. It was definetly a thriller. The murderer was probably the last person you would suspect so it was also like a mystery.
3,OKAY,"I finished this book yesterday and thought it was rather boring. Three-fourths of this book was about how she dicovered she was Laura.The rest was about how the killer was after her. And Mr.Parrish was discribed as a man in his fourties, really he should be 36. Laura died 18, 18 years later. Do the math. The book was good but I would like more horror."
4,"Amazing, but way too long!","The whole series of ""Power!"" is fantastic, but if you are not a person with lots of patience and basic music theory, technically and theoretically, this book will keep the whole Ableton thing above your head. Otherwise, this is all you will need to master Ableton..."
4,Doggone Math,I used this CD to teach my children various concepts in math. They loved the format and got really excited when we listen. I even let them perform to the music. It is a good alternative for the classroom.
4,It seems good,There is only one protector that comes with this. They don't really make that clear. It is kind of hard to get all of the bubbles when applied. And it leaves a tiny gap between the screen and the edge of my IPAQ 2490C. But over all it seems like a nice product.
4,"Two great movies, shrink-wrapped together (not a set)","This is not actually a ""set"" of these two fantastic comedies. Rather, it's the Holy Grail Collector's Edition (a very nice boxed 2-DVD set), shrink-wrapped together with the Life of Brian Immaculate Edition (another 2-DVD set in a standard plastic case). It's a good value, saving you $9 over the cost of purchasing both separately. And the packaging for the Holy Grail discs is especially nice (it includes the script of the movie in paperback format, and a few other goodies).If you're a Python fan, this is a terrific value. Even if you already have one of the movies, this might be worth picking up just for the items included in the Holy Grail box."
5,"A Class, Must-See Set","A truly wonderful set of two classics. The dry humor employed in Monty Python might not appeal to all audiences, but as a lover of such shows as Arrested Development, the Simpsons, and Family Guy, these films are Great!"
3,disappointed,"I did not intend to purchase two sets of the product. In review of the product for purchese it was not easy to determine that I was purchasing one dual set rather than two dual sets.Amazon could have represented the product better by including the movie ratings. One movie was rated PG. great, no problem. However the other was rated R - which makes half of my purchase worthless, since I cannot view them with my family due to excessive use of the ""F"" word."
5,Great Book,"Tuchman is a splendid writer as wittnessed by her Pulitzers. She gives us an intimate insight of a not too well known or understood time, place and characters."
4,Reads like a novel.,"Stillwell and the American Experience, is everything it claims to be a well written and an interesting story, told by one of the greatest historians of the twentieth century. It has a captavating introduction which draws the reader; however, about half-way through the book it begins to become somewhat repetitive and laggy, one almost feels as if he is experiencing this agonizing political war with Chaing Kia-Shek. But overall a good book about a trying time."
3,Full view?,"This book is a fascinating read (though does get somewhat repetitive) but I can't help wondering why she didn't include more perspective on China's internal struggles -- and why Stillwell didn't factor it in to his negotiations with Chiang. The book repeatedly gives the impression that Chiang was building military strength, taking it from the Americans under the pretext of fighting the Japanese with it, simply to intimidate his rivals. There was a lot more than intimidation going on."
5,"An excelent,well researched documentation.","Barbara Tuchman sheds much light on a time in history that is very much misunderstood,and,of which there is very little knowledge. I read Stilwell many years ago and think it should be reprinted,It would be very informative as to the actual history of China in the 20th century,and how she evolved into what she is today.Russ Strand"
2,long rambling sentences,"I do not like Tuchman's 'style' of writing. At first I thought she must be a Brit because her sentences are long and rambling and frankly almost impossible in some cases to interpret. They run together and I have to just wade through page by page. Very interesting subject matter but the book is much more like a text book of the history of China than a book on Stilwell. I understand the background history is of utmost importance but she jumps back and forth and many times I have to go back to find dates for the time she is talking about. Not sure I will be able to make it though this book. I've been to China 6 times, Taiwan two times and have a historical background but it hasn't helped much with this book.Fascinating subject matter however. Just seems like someone should have proof read better and re-arranged a lot of her sentences that are a paragraph long and future present or some such thing!"
3,Important but ...,"As much as I think this books has provided a lot of information/insight during the period, I found author's comtemptuous attidude towards Chinese a bit hard to swallow. In a way, she was somehow biased when she wrote the book. In no way I'm accusing her of distorting the fact, but, how the fact is presented will shape the opinion of a general reader about Chinese. This is probably not the main point of the book, but for a book that has won putlizer prize, I would have expected more."
2,Just alright.,"This book was pretty disappointing. I expected to read about the 10 best travel places, in different categories, and instead it's about the best kinds of tea, the best steaks, the best hotels, etc. It's an okay book, but if I could take back buying it I definitely would."
3,I expected more,"It is a good book with good information, but I expected too much more, it does not have any pictures so you can not get an idea of most of the places you are reading about."
2,The cover over promises and under delivers,"I was very disappointed in this book. I expected better from National Geographic. There are a lot of inaccuracies, for example suggesting a theatre visit as one of the ten best things to do in London on a Sunday afternoon - almost all theatres are closed on Sunday and that one definitely is. So how accurate is the rest of it? The hotels and restaurants are the most expensive you could possibly find, but the most expensive are not always the best and the average reader could never follow these recommendations. It's a snob's guide. Don't waste your money."
5,Must Have!!,"I bought this book back in 1992 when I first became a Queen fanatic. There are some great pictures and quotes, along with kind of an abbreviated history of the band. It concludes with a list of all of Queen's music releases up until 1992. It is a beautiful book that is well worth the money. You will look at it again and again."
5,Queen: The New Visual Documentary,"Although I already had 4 books on Queen and Freddie Mercury, I am so glad I purchased this book.It is a beautifully written and illustrated book, brimming with information, and chronologically accurate. Buy it!You won't be disappointed!It has a permanent place on my coffee table along with "" Queen the Ultimate Illustrated History of the CrownKings of Rock and Roll"" by Phil Sutcliffee."
5,Great condition,Was a great price and came in brand new condition! Arrived quickly and as promised. Used for class and it was very helpful for understanding diplomatic decisions
2,What a stretch!,"It's a real stretch to say that this book is anything different than just numerology. Sure you get a bit of info on the Hebrew letters but the rest is pure numerology. Also, the book is very carelessly put together...needs lots of proof reading."
5,classic and underrated!,this a terrific album that i could have received a lot more pub. the music still sounds relevant today. highly recommended. great album from an underrated band!
5,Even better than the LP,I already own this on LP.... CD is just that much better... Amazon got it to me quickly as usual... shop here with confidence!!
5,"After 30+ years, STILL a great recording!","Have racked my brain trying to remember when/where etc I first heard this album which I absolutely wore out in the 70's! Danny O'keefe is one of our rare, under-rated song writers that writes completely from the heart. His rich voice is pure pleasure to listen to & it has only gotten better with time. This CD is a must have-and for me, it took me down memory lane...just can't remember which lane!Sally Perry Plummer"
5,La nostalgie n'est plus ce qu'elle était by Simone Signoret,I read the autobiography of the actress Simone Signoret. It is one of the most beautiful memories I ever read. Transmits authenticity. Helga Hoffmann
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I love using Chip sticks to eat any and all Asian foods and decided it was time to invest in some eat-ware for home. these ones just arrived and, I would compare the quality to the disposable ones.. size is comparable to that of some good acrylic ones.. If you are getting these for decor or a one time use then fine but I personally do not recommend these as reusable but fine as a single use."
2,Not A Lot of Information,"I was pretty disappointed in this book, as its Amazon reviews suggested it was the subject's definitive resource. I found the book's section on crocodilians (my main interest) to be lacking. Unfortunately, the book was the most expensive of any, on crocodilians I've purchased, and provided probably the least information. The author's source of information on crocodilians appears to have been limited to specimens kept in zoos, and even that was not based on first-hand experience. The author's description of crocodilians is general, at best, and in some instances erroneous. For a better buy, pick up a copy of Charles Ross' (Editor) ""Crocodiles and Alligators"", or Lynne Kelley's ""Crocodile"" if you're interested in the history of crocodilians in life and mythology."
1,Coupon Book Bust,"I had an idea for a coupon book business and hoped this would help me with planning. It was geared more for small fundraising, not business."
4,Conditioning your Color,"Always in search of the best beauty products on the market, I gave this product a try after seeing it featured in Instyle Best Beauty Buys 2008. A big fan of hair product lines bumble and bumble and kerastase, I was looking for a more reasonably priced shampoo. While this may not be priced along the lines of l'oreal color vive, it also is not expensive for a SALON product. Plus, if you think about what you spend to have your hair colored, highlighted, lowlighted, or any other treatment, spending a little bit more money on a hair care product which extends the life of your color is a small price to pay to decrease how often you have to have your color done. Overall, I think it is absolutely worth the money. Used with the shampoo, your hair will be light, shiney, soft, and your color will look fabulous. I believe this line is a must try!!!"
2,My daughter is happy but...,"This is the one item that my daughter wanted for christmas. She is very happy that her Barbie Dolls have a ""Barbie Camper"" (I am not telling her it is actually a Hot Tub Pary Bus....what five year old needs a hot tub party bus for her dolls? Despite her enthusiasm, the product is not worth the price. The fold out couch does not stay attached as it should - and is already broken. None the less...she still loves it."
3,big fun,This rv is lots of fun. But it is made to be disposable. I don't see it lasting very long. The problem is that it is made like most Barbie accessories- flimsy. If they would only make this with more quality it would be well worth the original asking price and they wouldn't have to put it on clearance immediately.
1,garbage,I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. This item is so poorly put together I can't believe it. The folding couch bed does not stay assembled no matter what. The shower door & adjacent wall keep popping out as well. Everytime she plays with it things are falling off. Don't waste your money like I did. We are both very disappointed.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!,"I read all the reviews but thought some people must be extra picky. I also felt like there were no other choices of toys for my daughter to use when playing with her Barbies. I have such fond memories of playing with my own Barbie airplane and camper. But, this product is so cheap! I can't believe they get away with it and that people actually pay for it. It was so frustrating for my daughter because the doors kept coming off and the sofa that folds out would not work properly. It really interfered with being able to play with it at all. Furthermore, I was a little uncomfortable with the nature of it. Why can't it be a camper or something less sexualized? A party van with a hot tub and wine glasses?! That seems a little inappropriate and not exactly what we should be teaching our children. I've lost my faith in Barbie!"
5,IT IS SO COOL IT IS SCARY! ( VIVIDLY!),"I AM TYPING IN CAPS BECAUSE I FRACTURED MY RIGHT WRIST! I LOVE MY HOT TUB PARTY BUS VERY MUCH. IT IS SO COOL AND A LOT OF FUN! BRATZ LOVERS, YOU CAN USE THIS BUS FOR YOUR BRATZ!(I HAVE TRIED.) ONLY 2 THINGS I DON'T LIKE ARE THE SOUND BUTTONS ARE KINDA HARD TO SPOT AT FRIST. THE OTHER THING MY HORN IS UNCONTROLABLE. WHEN THE BUS IS ON THE HORN SOMETIMES BLASTS BY ITSELF. SOMETIMES THAT SCARES ME! OH WELL!"
1,Do not waste your money!,We bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter at Christmas last year and needless to say I was so excited about it! Especially because it brought back memories of when I played with the RV van as a child. My expectations were very high! My husband and I were extremely disappointed with how much of a piece of junk this toy turned out to be. We didn't even want to put it under the Christmas tree! Everything fell apart and never stayed in place or together making it very hard to enjoy. Some of the details were nice - like the kitchen area and the bathroom but it was hard for my daughter to enjoy this because she was constantly asking us to help her fix it. Very disappointed with this. I hope they make some improvements on these toys - for the amount of money they are asking for it! Sorry to bring a bad review but if we could have taken this toy back we would have!
2,fun for kids but very cheaply made,"We bought this toy for our 4 yr old daughter and she loves playing with it, but everytime you open it or touch anything it falls apart. Its alot of work b/c you are constantly putting it back together. It is fun and a great concept, but I would look for something more durable."
4,Barbie Hot Tub Party Bus,"I have to say this bus is great! My kids are 6 and 8, and they love the hot tub( you can put water in it)and it's sound affects! The bathroom is detailed and cute, but very small. The kitchen and the living room area are fabulous, just one down fall, the couch/bed falls apart. Maybe in the future the company will revise and fix these problems. My kids are not disappointed, they are fine with the little quirks, so am I. To tally it up, my kids love it,I love it! It's fun!"
1,great idea/poor manufacture,"My daughter received this for Christmas. The idea of the Barbie bus is a great one but she gets very frustrated when she plays with it. When the bus opens, there is supposed to be a couch that folds out into a bed. The pieces do not stay together and the bed/couch crumbles into 3 pieces. The bathroom door does not stay on very well nor does the shower head. The front seat doesn't glide easily and Barbies are hard to fit in. She plays with it some but not worth the price. I wouldn't buy this if I could go back in time."
2,Not that great!,"I was so disappointed when I opened the box to put the decals on this bus. Mattel has really come down with the quality of their products. I had a camper way back when and I can remember it being much better than this. The fridge and bathroom doors wouldn't open. If I managed to get the bathroom door open, it would come off. The bed keeps coming apart. Then, the worst - Christmas Eve and the darn thing didn't work! I re-checked batteries, etc. Nothing. Amazon was fabulous about replacing it - I had a new one on Dec. 27 and told my daughter that Santa sent it to us and he was sorry the first one didn't work. The second one works and the doors are much better, but the bed still falls apart the minute you touch it. Very frustrating for a three year old. I didn't want to get it based on other reviews, but it was one of only three things my daughter asked Santa for and I kind of felt like I had to. She does love to play with it, however."
2,Barbie Bus,"This was the number one item on my six year old daughter's Christmas wish list. She was so happy to open her present on Christmas Morning. Unfortunately, the fold down beds, the bathroom doors and other parts are always falling off or breaking completely. Every time she plays with it she has five minutes of fun and then ten minutes of frustration waiting for me to fix the ""fallen off"" parts. I would really reconsider another Barbie item before purchasing this vehicle. The spa also is really hard to open on the outside of this vehicle. She can not do it herself so either my husband or myself must always do it for her."
2,looks neat but falls apart,"Having grown up with the Barbie camper, I thought this was going to be great for my daughter. While she enjoys it (despite pieces coming off while she's playing), I am disappointed that it's just not made as well as it used to be. The fold-out bed, table and the door come detached all the time. While the idea is fun (had the materials been more durable), it's a big hunk of decorated thin plastic that is too tempermental to withstand any serious play."
3,Cool toy but falls apart too easily,"Cool toy but falls apart too easily! my daughter likes this toy but everything falls apart. the bed falls apart, the table falls apart. does not seem to be made very durable especially for small, not so gentle hands. the 'totally real barbie house' is made the same way. i had a dream house and a motorhome from the 1970's growing up and they were made so much more durable. too bad to sold it 20 years ago. i wish toys were still made the same."
2,Great Idea - in Theory,"This bus has a big potential fun factor - IF - the pieces weren't always falling off. I've given up on the fold-out couch. It's worse than the old-timey real ones we used to struggle with. Other reviews mentioned this bad feature, but I thought, how bad can it be? Bad!! The sounds & lights features are nifty. Lots of fun to be had if you don't move anything abruptly. I'm not sure I'd recommend this product given its steep price."
5,Must have for Barbie lovers,"I bought this toy for my niece for Christmas. I was impressed by how well the toy was made as well as how fun it has been for her. The hot tub actually has bubbles that work, the light works, and she plays with this everyday. This is a must have for all barbie lovers! I wish they had this when I was a kid!!"
2,"HOurs of fun, but falls apart very easy","Brought this item for my Grandaughter for Christmas. She has already had hours of fun, but the pieces fall apart very easy. We are always having to help her put parts back together. The bed and the table and some of the walls do not stay together."
4,An enjoyable Christmas Gift,"This is her husband, speaking for Nancy. Our daughter was ecstatic over her Hot Tub Party Bus. While it is fun, a number of pieces pop off with play, which can be frustrating to our daughter. Fortunately the design is such that parts that pop off, pop back on. I think there was a tradeoff made in longterm durability as opposed to the frustration of pieces easilly popping off (the sofa, the bathroom wall, showerhead, etc). Even when our toddler tries to get his hands on it he probably can't break it permanently. I am happy with it overall as our daughter is as well."
4,I'm the Best Daddy!,"What can I say? I got this for my 6 year old and I'm the best Dad in the whole world.My daughter is always pretty careful with her toys. The durability in this one leaves a lot to be desired, but she likes the Barbie experience so much. There are many small pieces that come with it and you wonder where to put it all.She likes it and she takes care of her things... we're happy."
2,Frustrating and cheap,"This is so cute and I thought of when I was a kid getting the barbie airplane and things like this, well they sure dont make them like they use to! This plastic is so cheap, things constantly are falling apart I was totally stressed by the time I got that couch in and up down it falls up again down it falls as in falls apart, the hinges are to small for the part its suppose to fit in, just bottem line JUNK.. I have never wrote a review but swore I was going to for this one! Sick of overpriced toys that are a waste of money and most places wont return them even if they are falling apart...I guess we grow money on trees now?"
4,Awsome!,I bought this for my 4 year old and she loves it! Even her 7 year old sister is crazy about it. They have had it for a week and are constantly playing with it. The only fault that I find with it is that the couch/bed constantly falls apart. It's annoying but the girls have just stopped using it as a bed and use it as the couch. I would recommend this any girl who loves Barbie!
4,It's a party on the Barbie Party Bus!,"I bought this Barbie toy for my 5 year-old daughter (and yeah, maybe for me, too!) and we have been having fun playing with the bus with her Beach Fun Barbies. The sounds the bus makes are the horn on the steering wheel, the microwave oven and the flashing lights and music for the ""hot tub"". My daughter gets a kick out of pushing the button to change the music for the tub, which also makes ""jacuzzi"" water sounds. The only thing we don't like about the content of the bus is dealing with the fold out couch-to-bed setup. The thing falls apart every time we try to set it up or fold it for storage. Otherwise, the bus has alot of detail and fun accessories. I think we'll be playing with it for quite a few years."
3,Lots to do with no substance,My husband and I bought this for our daughter who is 4 and 1/2 and she absolutely loves it and it keeps her busy for hours. The only problem is everything falls apart all the time. The concept of the party bus is great but they need to modify it's design substantially. Everything comes apart. The kitchen table does not remain attached and also the second bed or sofabed falls apart constantly that we took it out and the bathroom doors fall off as well. Who knows maybe ours is just defective. It is not worth the money but worth your child's fulfillment.
4,Barbie Mania,"Girls love the RV. As with other Barbie ""stuff"", attachments detach almost too easily. Parts are always spread about and just a little complicated to put back together."
1,Not worth the money,My husband and I bought this bus as a Christmas present for our four and a half year old daughter. We were completely disappointed with the quality. All the plastic pieces are flimsy and continued to fall apart even as we assembled it. It will be returned tomorrow.
1,CHEAPEST MADE BARBIE ITEM EVER!!!!!!!!!,"Santa Claus brought this to my 8 year old daughter and boy what a disappointment! My husband is the king of putting toys together and he was just livid. The bed that is supposed to fold into a couch would not stay together. The mirrors fell off constantly. Even with brand new batteries, the sounds didnt work. Needless to say, my daughter couldnt believe Santa would make such a crappy toy. It has been sent back to ""the North Pole"" so Santa could send her something else in its place. The makers of Barbie should be ashamed to put out something so cheesey. HATED IT!!!!"
2,cheaply made,"My 6 yr old daughter got this for christmas. We have only played with it 2 hrs and that was it, She got so angry because everything kept falling apart on her. the table, couch, bathroom . The bus does not move easily across the floor so she was carring it instead. My husband has dedcided to screw everything together in order for her to play with. I did contact mattel and informed them of the expencive peice of nothing."
2,"Cute, but poorly designed and made","As others have said, the overall design and manufacturing of this toy is very weak. The plastic parts fit together poorly. Some hardly stay together at all, while others fall apart at the drop of a hat--or the touch of a small hand.Still, the bus itself is cute and pretty well made itself, and my daughter gets a kick out of pushing it around. I just wish its accessories worked they way she expected them to. Like the horrible ""Dancing Princesses"" castle and accessories, this was far from a banner year for Barbie. Sad, since my five-and-a-half-year-old daughter is just entering her Barbie mania years."
1,Please Don't Waste Your Money,I bought this for my 4 year old daughter who just loves Barbie. However this is the most cheaply made toy I have ever seen!! It constantly falls apart when trying to play with it. We returned it the next day. I was so dissapointed with this. Even my daughter was not upset to take it back.
1,Not Worth the Money,My daughter got this bus for Christmas. Nothing stays together and we can't seem to get any of the lights to work.
1,Just what all little girls *don't* need!,"As if little girls today weren't already oversexualized, along comes Barbie with a full swingers setup! What's next, credit cards and pre-rolled ""dollars"" as accessories? My 10 yr old and quite a few of her friends are downright insulted."
4,Nikon D50 Digital SLR DVD,"The video is very helpful, but you do need to have some familiarity with 35 mm cameras for it to make sense."
5,Seller's response..Very good,"Purchased the,ASIN # B000A0C71K Introductionto Nikon D50 SLR camera. Instructor on the DVD went fast. Had to go back to review to often. The seller was very good to respond with a refund.I would purchased from this seller again."
4,introduction to the nikon d50 digital slr,"I haven,t finished this dvd yet ,but so far it is very helpful and enjoyable to watch and rewind. The narrator has a good voice for explaining the d50.This dvd would be a plus for you to have in your library. TR"
2,[2.5 Stars] You get what you pay!,Well...the singing part is alright. Not superb supberb but listenable. I bought this DVD from local store since it was on sale for $10.99 and I knew from the reviews and etc. that this isn't a great version of Tosca whatsoever. But I was thinking it will be worth watching an opera for $10.99 and I was right. Though this DVD from Brilliant Classic surprisingly does not provide ANY kind of subtitles so you will need to purchase one from Kultur if you need ENG subtitle. You get what you pay.
3,cute but not so comfy,"I was hoping these would be as comfortable as they are cute but the strap is cutting and the base a little narrower than expected. I bought a 1/2 size larger than I usually wear for extra comfort but didn't get it...{got the size, not the comfort}"
5,Black Sabbath's Finest Hour!!,"This is one of the best Sab albums to come along for a long time!! This album reunites the Mob Rules line up Iommi, Butler, Appice, and Dio. This album is a classic, and should be up there with the likes of Paranoid and Heaven and Hell. Great blistering vocals by Dio, and blazing Iommi riffs. There's not a ballad in sight on this album, just straight up metal from Sab. Dio is my favorite vocalists with the exception of Ozzy, and he rightfully belongs in Black Sabbath. Great album you won't be disappointed!!"
4,Cheesy Album Cover Doomed this Metal Masterpeice,"I agree with the other reviewers on this one, this is an un-noticed metal masterpiece; front-to-back. You can tell these guys (Ronnie Dio, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Vinnie Apice) got together with one thing in mind...make a great, thought-provoking, complex, metal barn-burner that fans would like better than their previous high-point; ""Heaven and Hell"". In my opinion, this is musically as good or better than ""H&H;"" and definietly better than ""Mob Rules"".How did this album go so un-noticed? I don't know, maybe it was the absolutely stupid, and un-marketable artwork. It looks like they went to the local grade-school at the last minute and asked for volunteers to make a Black Sabbath CD cover. I had a difficult time sharing this CD with my friends because of the embarrasing cover! :0)That said; we all know what REALLY matters is the music, so buy it and you'll love it!"
4,DIO ROCKS,"Having last bought a Sabs album in 83 (Mob Rule)this was certainly no disappointment. Massively heavy production complements the stand out cuts - Computer God,TV Crimes, Time Machine and the grinding I. Faster songs are the best - slower ones are doom laden dirges.The quality of the best songs here stands alongside the other Dio era material."
5,"Short-lived reunion of the ""Mob Rules""/""Live Evil"" lineup.","I didn't think this would last very long. Ronnie James Dio and the Guitar/Bass team of original Sabs Butler and Iommi work great in the recording studio but are obviously frought with personality dificulties in other areas. Nonetheless, ""Dehumanizer"" is a tour de force that any fan of Ronnie Dio would appreciate. Veteran Drumer Vinnie Appice reunites with Ronnie James Dio and company after leaving the DIO fold mid-""Lock up the Wolves"" for one of the best Black Sabbath projects since Heaven and Hell. Of most noteworthiness are the songs ""I"", ""Time Machine"" and a no-holds-barred attack on kristjianity aptly titled ""TV Crimes"". ""After all (the Dead)"" is argueably the heaviest Sabbath song since the Ozzy-fronted song by the band's name. A great companion album to the subsequent DIO release ""Strange Highways"", ""Dehumanizer"" obviously inspired Ronnie James Dio to drasticly alter the sonic textures! of his namesake solo project."
5,Metal at it's finest,"I had read negative reviews about this CD, but after purchasing 'The Dio Years'(I listened to Dio cassettes while studying at Miss State in the mid 80's) and hearing the songs from Dehumanizer from that CD, I was perplexed. I went ahead and purchased Dehumanizer, and have now come to the conclusion that those negative reviewers do not understand true hard rock or are from another planet. Dehumanizer is perhaps one of the best metal CD's I have ever heard, and this is what, 16 years later. Dio's vocals are top notch and the instruments are crisp and tight. The late 80's and early 90's (between glam and grunge) produced some very fine rock albums, and this is definitely one of them."
4,Good stuff,After Ozzy's period the only good Sabbath is with Dio on vocals.Heaven and hell and dehumanizer are really good albums.I love TV crimes lyrics they really make you think about what really happens with religion.It's a shame they didn't stay with Dio after this one.anyway it was good to have great new music from Sabbath in the 90's.
4,dio returns,"This is classic meldodic metal and the songs are very good here. Dio was back for another round and the band plays it tight. This isn't as great as the classic heaven and hell but it's very good. I liked it very much indeed and I reject thrash as the best kind of metal. Black sabbath was creating some great metal here that is based on songwriting. At the time I was hoping for a heaven and hell type of release but this one worked well enough. ""time machine' is a stand out on this one. BUt if you like melodic metal then this one is a good one to add to your collection. rock on! dio is jamming on the other side, and you can bet that is the case."
5,"""Man's a mistake so we'll fix it""","So it goes Dehumanizer's opening track, Computer God. Released in 1992 when computers were beginning to take over us poor humans, this album just keeps growing both lyrically and musically. Dio's visionary lyrics are as good as it gets here.Sound wise, it basically blows up the speakers! Heavy and dark but not noisy. Tony and Geezer are in top form all through the album and Vinny Appice is solid.I guess the highlights would be the aforementioned Computer God, After All (The Dead), Letters From Earth, Master Of Insanity, and the slow one Too Late. But as classic albums go, all songs are worth listening to and make up for a great sonic experience.Don't miss it if you've dug Heaven And Hell and Mob Rules for, even though it was recorded a decade after, Dehumanizer is - without a doubt - a great sequel in the Sabbath-Dio saga!"
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST,With Dio this is one of the finest post Ozzy lps ever released.If you're Roman Catholic and don't like it maybe you are scared when The Exorcist comes on tv.Case closed
1,Disappointing,"I love Sabbath's music, Ozzy and post Ozzy eras. But I'm sorry to say I hate this album, it does absolutely nothing for me. The songwriting is weak."
3,Best Album With Dio,"Dehumanizer actually sounds like a Black Sabbath record, not like a bunch of guys backing Ronnie Dio, my least favorite Sabbath vocalist. Geezer Butler can catually be heard playing something on this one, and the sound is a good 90's update while still retaining the Sabb integrity.You might ask why is this better than 'Heaven And Hell'? Well, all of side two were throwaways on that one. 'Mob Rules'? Half baked followup to a mediocre one sided album.'Live Evil' The little troll one destroys the Ozzy classics,proves he's the most annoying front man alive, and even Ian Gillan could and did sing those songs and ""Heaven And Hell"" better live( I have a concert recording to prove it!!!), despite being a part of a travesty like 'Born Again'. Not classic, but better than any other post Ozzy effort."
2,No chance,"With Dio, or Hughes or Martin, there's no chance: Sabbath is gone. THis CD really has its momentos, but they are very feel if you consider the capabilities of Iommi and Butler."
5,This album is like a blast from the past !!!,"About time Dio's reunited with Sabbath. Dehumanizer reminds me of when I used to walk around my neighborhood blasting ""Rainbow in the Dark out of my boom box! It's in the same class as Dio's holy diver album. It's classic 1980's Black Sabbath with Dio. Ozzy was good but Dio with Tony Iommi and the gang rules. Every song is awesome."
2,Review for the vinyl version,"Dehumanizer is easily a four star record but this is a review of the newly released vinyl version. This is a prime example of how NOT to release a vinyl version of an album. This is absolutely terrible. No gatefold. No liner notes. No nothing. It's not even re-mastered! I got it on vinyl hoping that it would sound warmer but it still has the same stale, surgical sounding production as the original '92 version. I can't vouch for the re-mastered version of the CD but this is a very disappointing product coming from a label that prides themselves on giving vinyl the proper respect and treatment it's due. Rhino should hang their collective heads in shame, seriously. Conversely the recently released `H&H - The Devil You Know' vinyl version is incredible. Everything a collector yearns for and more. 180g vinyl. Gatefold. Poster! AND laser etching on side four! The only thing it was missing was a personally greeting from all the band members, lol. This is highly recommended."
1,IT NEEDS COURAGE TO KNOW WHEN TO STOP.,"It needs courage to know when to stop. Not stop music, because this is impossible for someone who love it so much as TOny Iommi. But to stop SABBATH while the legend was still strong. TOny Iommi, just he, the father ""of the child"", destroyed almost all credibility SABBATH had. He released e lot of rotten albuns, each one featuring a different line-up, each one a deception to real fans. He should have stopped after ""MOB RULES"", because the line-up with Dio was the last chance, really. He says he tried to go as a solo-artist in ""SEVENTH STAR"", but the record companie didn't want that. Be he should have tried to go solo again, lefting behind forever and uncasthed the saintly name of ""BLACK SABBATH"". THis Dehumanizer is a cheap try to go back to the glory days of DIo, but it failed miserably, as all other records."
1,The Worst For the Band,"This is simply the worst album the band could have put together. A reunion of Iommi, Butler, Dio, and Appice....it just plain sucks.Interestingly enough, this particular lineup lasts just this one album, making one wonder whether everyone had their heart into the album as a whole? The riff work from Iommi is quite stiff in this, not at all what he exhibits previously or after this album. RJD comes up with some of the worst lyrics to date for his capabilities. He does better with latter solo efforts, as well as his earlier efforts with Black Sabbath. Furthermore, RJD's vocal work is hardly awe-inspiring - again, he does better on his later solo work, early solo work, and his earlier Black Sabbath albums. Really one of the worst albums they've put together, IMHO, and one to avoid at all costs.Now, if you're a Sabbath or RJD collector, its obviously a must-have."
1,What are they trying to prove?,"To give this album 5 stars you gotta be out of your (musical) mind! This is without doubt the second worse album from Sabbath. If you like ""Heaven or hell"" this is not for you, but if you think Dio's ""Strange highway"" is a masterpiece, I guess this one will satisfy your twisted taste."
1,I WANNA KNOW WHY ....,"I'd like to know why people get so angry when someone says that the only good Black Sabbath was that with Ozzy. THey say this is prejudice, hard-mind, etc. Well, let's see. Can someone figure QUEEN without Freddie Mercury. answer: no, so they quit. Can someone figure AC/DC without Angus Young, even being Malcolm the main songwriter? No. Can someone figure IRON MAIDEN without Steev Harris ? No. So, Black Sabbath ceased to exist when Ozzy left, even being Iomi the main songwriter. With Dio, they at least had a respectable replacement and still a lot of crative genius in Iommi and Butler. But, after that, they finished forever, and each new album bringing the name ""SABBATH"" in the front cover helped to destroy the myth. Sad. This is the simple truth."
1,The little man from India should shut up.,"""Sabbath Stone"" is an alias of a little man in India who writes barely articulate reviews and expects us Americans to take them seriously. What a loser. Just stay away from Black Sabbath, with or without Ozzy."
4,DIO BELONGS IN SABBATH!,"If you ever seen Sabbath? If you ever seen Dio? Only one thought comes across,They need to be together! DEHUMANIZER has a feel all it's own,they will never recapture the originality of HEAVEN&HELL or MOB RULES,EVER! When Sabbath got back together with Ozzy for there reunion.(someone needed some buck's)They blew it! From the begining of COMPUTER GOD to the end of TIME MACHINE,This is a rocking cd. This is a very strong metal cd,and proves just one more time that Tony Iommi is the riffmaster of the darkness within us all. So if your into(heavy)heavy metal,get DEHUMANIZER,makes a great x-mas gift too! But don't look for HEAVEN&HELL,MOB RULES,part 2 here.just wont find it? THANK YOU VERY MUCH!"
1,Worthless for complicated tax forms,"TaxCut did not warn me that I needed to fill out additional forms required for taking the exemption for a qualified child, nor did it lead me through the Schedule C like TurboTax does. TurboTax may be more expensive, but it's well worth it to save the headaches that this program caused. If you have complicated tax forms or unusual tax situations (or prefer an intuitive program, rather than something that makes you say ""What am I supposed to do next???"") stick with TurboTax."
1,Taxcut bug,"This program has a bug in processing 1099-R data that makes the whole software package useless to me. After filling in the data from my 2005 1099-R form, the program informed me that these monies were taxable in 2003 not 2005, and that these data would not be included in my 2005 return. I could not find a way overide this problem. Also, there was no apparent way to directly contact H&R Block to find out how to fix it. After wasting a couple of hours I now have to trash the taxcut software and spend more money to purchase turbo-tax, which from prior years experience is relatively bug free."
1,Unable to Install,"Taxcut Standard hangs at 26% installation on the file mmvdpro.swf . I have Windows XP SP2 and tried to install in safe mode with no luck. I installed Macromedia Flash Player since this is a Flash file and still had no luck. I noticed reviews on the Deluxe had problems on the same file at 21%. I went to the Taxcut web page and found no help. I emailed Taxcut and they did not have an informed response, only to turn off all running software which seems to be the standard response for all nonresponsive software installs no matter what the error is. I do not believe they know what the problem is since they could not or would not explain why this particular file hangs."
3,How to Fix the 21% Hang Error -- mmvdpro.swf,"I found this on the HR Block website for the problem when trying to install the software with Win XPhttp://answer.taxcut.com/index.cfm?svc=152&DocFile;=http://www.kb.techknow-how.com/exports/partner_data/30/html/30-234883230.htmlIF that link does not work just search hrblock.com under customer support, fixing errors, hangs and crashes, While installing TaxCut, the process stops part way through the installation. Follow the instructions."
3,Installation hang @ 21% mmvdpro.swf,"This hang happened everytime I tried to install the program. I went to Taxcut.com for customer support and they had a link that said the problem was with fonts used on the program. They gave me a patch that did nothing. The problem still happened. So I read the reviews on this site and one person had the very correct idea of installing or updating your shock wave flash player. After thinking about it, this made perfect sense, look at the extension that hangs: swf. This worked perfectly. Thank you to that person. But why on earth would taxcut try to give people a font patch that doesn't even solve the real problem. Don't bother with that patch and just update your flash player."
5,The New Don't Blame Mother Mending Mother-Daughter Relationship,"This is the best book I've read on healing the relationship with Mother-Daughter! Great Great Book! However, this book needs to have an additional book with a title for healing the Mother-Son relationship or Healing the Mother Daughter and Son relationship. Every Man and Son needs to read this book but they won't due to the title. We need to heal Son's as well as Daughter's relationship and stop the blamming toward the one who loved us the most. I hope the Author Paula Caplan gets this information as I have not found a way to contact her.Thanks gail"
3,It isn't Mom's fault,"Takes a look at how children -- particularly daughters -- tend to blame their mothers for everything going wrong in their lives. Has a heavily feminist bent to it, a kind of ""why fight when we are all really just sisters?"" feel.... While lucidly written, it is still part of a cadre of other self-help books on the topic."
3,Stale,I found this presentation reminding me of a high school history teacher racing through a class just to be done with it. I was hoping for a more in depth presentation.
4,good phone,We were looking for a two line cordless phone that the kids and I could share on both lines. This is a good phone. We like it.
5,Sublime,"I played Svefn-G-Englar for my former girlfriend as she lay dying. To me, it was the best gift I could have given to her. I could sense from the expressions on her face that this music really touched her. It was beyond magical."
5,Great Purchase!,"Purchased this watch last year as a Christmas present for my wife. Actually, I purchased the gold one first she didn't like it as much (it was still a nice watch) so we returned (EASY return and quick too!) it for this one. After one year she still loves it. It has held up nicely over the year and still looks great. She really likes that it is classy, but understated. She isn't one for over the top jewelry and this fit the bill. Practical, good looking and a pretty good price.If you want to spoil your lady without breaking the bank take a close look at this watch!"
4,Great Looking,"The watch looks better in person than in the photo. The watch was a little big, but a quick to the local jewelery store to take a few links out and it looks great. I feel better having a nice watch that I can wear to formal events (like the wedding party I originally bought it for) and casual everyday wear. I feel it was well worth the money I paid for it."
2,"Beautiful, but description is deceptive","I own this watch. I cannot wear it though, because it is NOT stainless steel, as described. It gives me allergy, which means it is probably chrome-plated (i.e., not nickel-free, like a stainless steel hypoallergenic watch should be).I am buying a Bulova watch next - they are as advertized."
4,Cayman Cowboys by Eric Douglas,This story was really good. It seemed to convey thepersonality of the characters as well as the islandwhile telling an interesting story.I would recommend this to anyone who likes mysteriesor diving.
2,Don't bother....,Even as an avid SCUBA diver I couldn't get through this one. The plot line is uninteresting and the prose tepid.
5,Good adventure with fresh twists,"Loved the diving perspective - refreshing to read someone's writing about their ""day job"" who isn't a lawyer. The technical information about the diving and coral reefs was sown so nicely into the story line that you could really understand why the characters were doing what they were doing or seeing what they were seeing. Likeable characters, nice setting - and no crappy language or smutty sex to fill in places where the author didn't know what else to write!I look forward to the next Mike Scott adventure."
5,Truely Amazing!,"A really great presentation. Chantal has a beautiful voice, and even though I can't understand all the lyrics (different languages), the music, lyrics and performance on the whole made for a fantastic show. The setting is unique and very mystical, the entire environment helps to take you on a very enjoyable tour. Great Job!"
5,I Loved this book!!!!,"It was wonderful to see that Mr. Freeman, traveled around the country to visit and take the stories of these talented artists. I especially liked the quilts of Yvonne Wells."
5,The better version of the best Pablo.,"This has been, hands-down, my favorite collection of dub/reggae for over 20 years. If you are a fan of Pablo, this is a must own!p.s. The other reviewer is dead-on. The Shanachie version is quite inferior to this version. My only complaint is the re-working of the artwork...oh well, I still have my original vinyl to look at (it was worn out years ago)"
3,"Makes it louder, not clearer","First, it seems a little ridiculous that I need this in the first place. It seems suspicious that you would make a phone that would then need a separate amplifier. It is ridiculous that the phone is not loud enough to begin with. I work for a company that provides phone based services and the volume on my headset is just fine when I'm in office, but the home phone made by plantronics is very quiet and has some static. This amplifier does amplify the volume but also the static. Overall, the product makes the situation better than it was, but not by much, and it shouldn't be necessary to have in the first place."
2,"Excellent idea, horrible execution","Farley's main point centers around the relationship between radical suffering and divinity. Her work develops out of the free-will theodicy often invoked to explain radical suffering in the world. Rather than emphasizing mankind's free-will, though, she concentrates on God's compassion.Dry, dull, and winded, even by academic standards, this book ranks near the bottom of the theological hierarchy. Perhaps had she reduced this book to the 20-30 pages it actually needs to get its point across it would have been both more tolerable and more informative."
5,rocky point,i remember when i was about 7 years old and i went on the boat from fall river to rocky point and i thought i was in heaven with all the rides and games and the arcade. when i was 1o years old i had my first chance to eat at the shore dinner hall i had chowder and clamcakes boy what a treat. i also remember when they installed the corkscrew and i had just joined the organization american coaster enthusiasts and we had the chance to ride the corkscrew 1 hour before the general public came into the park i rode it 25 times and equated it to being in four car crashes my head was spinning. i have to thank mr. bettencourt and all the people that worked there for giving their hindsight all the history involved with rocky point makes for an interesting 2.diskdvd buy it you'll love it! coaster enthusiast roger d. lauzon
4,"Don't just memorize words, learn to use them!","I picked up this book from a shelf in a bookstore and I just had to have it. It is neatly organized by keyword and has both a Spanish and an English side. Each entry consists of a keyword, a brief definition, and the most common expressions using that word along with an example using it. People often face the problem of hearing a word in the context of an expression and finding it in a dictionary that gives its literal meaning. This book solves that problem. There are too many expressions, and no book could have every one imaginable, but this book makes a great attempt. I recommend this book to anybody who is at all interested in Spanish, in any stage of learning it."
5,Helpful for students,I'm a senior citizen taking a Spanish conversation class. This book was recommended by our instructor and each week we select 2 or 3 at random and discuss them. The material is excellent and fun. I always like just browsing and seeing how similar and how different Spanish idioms are from the English.
3,Grade: B,"This is third book that I've read in the Promises Series, and the best by far out of the three. What makes this book good is the hero Asa, he wants only to make Elizabeth happy and a home to call his own. I still don't know if I like the heroine Elizabeth, she was just too contradictory in my opinion, one minute she's a ladylike prude, the next she wants to be in control and run the ranch. Her character flaws prevented me from giving this book 4 or 5 stars."
4,"Good, but slow","This was my first book by Sarah McCarty and it was very enjoyable and sweet. My only problem with it was that everthing is so drawn out. The conversations are inane and go on forever and the plot is slow and tedious. The upside for most of you buying this type of book is that the love scenes are similarly drawn out and go on forever. All in all, I like the characters and thought their interactions were very sweet, which was a refreshing change."
5,Promises Linger is erotic romance at its best,"Sarah McCarty is truly an amazing talent. Her characters are perfectly drawn, in depth, and full of life. Each and every one of her books shows a depth of thought, execution and attention to detail that many authors attempt to reach but never do. Take a chance on Promises Linger or any of Sarah's novels, and you'll be gratified by the haunting storylines, vivid description and exceptional characterization.Denise A. Agnewauthor of DEEP IS THE NIGHT: DARK FIREwww.deniseagnew.com"
3,Peek-a-Boo!,"I got this for my daughter when she was 2 months old. Now that she is 6 months old when she wakes up in the morning she will play with the mirror & talk to the baby in it until I am ready to go in & get her up in the morning. This buys me extra time for chores & feed the dog before I get her up. Although she seems to like it fine, I know there are better products on the market now. But, the important thing is that she likes it!"
5,Recomended by baby Nicholas!,"My son loves his Me in the Mirror! He'll spend a good 5 or 10 minutes every morning kicking it on the side of his crib. During tummy time, I'll take it out of the crib and put it on the floor in front of him. It really encourages him to push up on his arms so that he can see his ""playmate"" in the mirror. It's a good product for the price."
1,Happy at first...but then disappointed...,"My 5 week old daughter really likes to look at herself and I got this mirror and she seemed to be enjoying it. I had it in the pack-n-play, on the couch and finally I put it in the crib with her - I figured it's tied on, what could happen...The ties on it place the purple ring toy on the bottom of the mirror. My daughter was taking a nap and all of a sudden I heard this scream...she's not even a crier so I was very alarmed. There is a loop of ribbon on the purple ring toy and she got her finger caught in the loop and was pulling frantically to get it off. She wasn't injured, but I am not keeping the mirror in the crib anymore."
4,My daughter's favorite toy when she was younger,"My baby LOVED this toy when she was younger. She loved to stare at herself in the mirror. I propped it up next to her changing table as nice distraction while I changed her. Then, she started playing with the ball and became obsessed with it. A few weeks later, she discovered how much fun the velcroed bird was to take off every time I stuck it back up. About a month later, she started putting the ring into her mouth and gumming it. So, it's a toy that grows with your baby a little bit. She still plays with it at 6 months, but not as much.I would have given it 4 stars, if it weren't for the simple fact that, unlike what the product description claims, the darn thing will NOT sit up on its own. It also has these very short straps that are supposed to allow you to tie it to the crib...they are much too short to do that.If those things were changed, this would be a perfect toy and would be given to every expectant mother I knew!"
5,This is a great way to wake up!,"My daughter has had this toy since she was around 2 months old. I have it in her crib. When she wakes up, she looks at it/herself in the mirror and is fascinated. It keeps her from crying when she wakes. She really likes it, and now that she is 3 months, she is trying so hard to reach out and touch the toys. I think it will keep her occupied even as she gets older."
4,Great for self-entertaining baby!,"My baby discovered this mirror at daycare - she loves attention & the mirror was a great distraction while she was unable to move around on her own. We bought one for the crib & it was great! She used to cry going into her crib & now she laughs. She loves to chew on the attached toys & spin the ball. I wish it was a little more stable when placed on the floor - one touch & it folds & falls down - not a safety concern, but baby wonders where the mirror went. VERY PORTABLE!"
5,Best product ever for the money spent!!,"My baby loved it since he was 2 months old. Now he is 11 months and still plays with it. It is light, not noisy, lets the baby interact with his image and offers a variety of toys. We love it!! I think it was the best $12 spent in my life."
4,Twins love it but beware of tiny hands,I bought this mirrow and my 6 month old twins love it. They take turns playing with it in their cribs.The only concern I have is with one of the round teething toys it has attached to it. My daughter is tiny because they were born premature and one day I heard her scream because she had gotten her hand stuck through the hoop and couldn't take it out.Since then I let them play with it because they do like talking to their reflections but never unattended and I always take it off their crib before they go to sleep.
5,Ohhh...fascinating to an 8week old...,"My daughter loves this SO much, that I can't put it in her crib yet. The one time I tried it in her crib, she wouldn't nap! She loves the mirror. I agree with previous review-most mirrors are warped. This mirror is pretty good. My daughter is fascinated by the bright colors-esp. the little squiggly things on the side of it. I love how lightweight it is bc it's so portable. I take it to my mom's house when she babysits. I put a shoe in the middle to steady it when I sit it upright bc it is so lightweight and can easily be knocked over. It's so versitile and so inexpensive and just fascinating to my daughter that I recommend it to all my friends."
5,Great toy from birth and up!,"We bought this for our daughter when she was two weeks old, and it has never failed us. In the earliest weeks, she enjoyed it for tummy time, and eventually learned to bat at the bird and other objects, as well as the ""baby in the mirror."" As she got older it was a safe toy that we left in the crib for her all the time. We would hear her playing with the toys or talking to the ""baby in the mirror"" while falling asleep, or just after waking in the morning."
2,"Be careful, the ribbon made cuts!!!","I bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old. I tied it to the crib. Maybe he wasn't ready at that time, he was not interested at the mirror at all. I also used it for his tummy time, but the angle that the base made seems like he couldn't see himself, he just didn't care about it. As he getting bigger, we try it again, I thought it would be a very safe toy, but watch out! My son was playing the purple ring and the ribbon attached made cuts on his finger! Since then I don't let him play with it anymore."
4,cute mirror toy,We put this in our 7 month olds playpin and he loves it. He plays peek a boo with himself. It is a neat toy because you can put a family picture in the back of it.
2,Doesn't stand up,"The design interests my baby, but the mirror will not stay standing up, especially if my baby grabs on to anything on it. I have to sit with her and hold it up while she plays with it. It does have ties to tie onto a crib, but I like to use it when she is playing on the floor."
3,Sassy Me In the mirror,"I thought the idea of this toy was good but my little one didn't like it. She was interesting in this toy for the first few minutes, particularly in the mirror but that's all. Now among all toys she has she doesn't even touch it. I thought the toy is very light and can't stand as shown on the picture. The quality is poor for this price too."
3,Its Okay....,"Well, I am pretty disappointed in this mirror. Mainly becaause what I got was nothing like the picture. It doesn't have the spot for the picture on the back, the toys and colors are different and the way it opens and stands at the bottom is different? My girls still enjoy it though, but if they grab at the ring and the mirror is sitting on the floor it can be tipped over easily. The only way to use this without being constantly annoyed by it falling over is to tie it in the crib.All in all not a bad item."
3,Not as pictured...,"Not that it matters that much, but my mirror is green with white spots instead of red. More importantly, though, my mirror does NOT have a frame in the back to put a picture. As mentioned by another reviewer, it's not very sturdy during tummy time, etc. when the mirror is not hanging in the crib or tied to something. But, that said, my baby loves it. It's good for the money, just not exactly what is advertised."
5,LOVE IT!!!,We got the mirror as a gift. At the time the baby was still in the cradle so I put the mirror in the car rather then the crib. I tied the mirror to the back seat and with the rear facing car seat he can see himself in the mirror and he smiles and laughs. It also works as a view for me from the rear view mirrow. I can see him and see if he is awake or asleep. He really likes it!
3,Cut Hand,"Be careful with this crib mirror. I thought it was great at first and my son loved all of the toys on it, but I started noticing cuts on my son's hands. I'm pretty sure ribbon cut him. I took it out of my son's crib and haven't seen any cuts on him since. Make sure you feel the ribbon for yourself before you decide to register for this. It also needs a tie at the bottom in addition to the two on the top of it. When my son would tug a bit on it, the mirror would slide down on the crib since there is no tie at the bottom of the mirror."
4,Great for solo play time!,"We tied this to our crib when my son was about 5 weeks old. He would accidentally kick/swat at it and would hear the rattling sound. Now that he is 3 mos, he loves to check himself in the mirror while cooing and hitting the rattle intentionally. We watch him on our baby monitor playing at all hours when he doesn't feel like sleeping! Love this toy- would love more just like it!I only wish that there were ties at the bottom edge of the toy as well as the top. When he hits the rattle, it flops around and we feel it should be anchored to the crib better."
4,We love this toy! Very versatile,"We use this in the crib, for tummy time and in the car. I have two of them! It was a life saver!"
2,Not that impressed,"My daughter has had this since she was 3 months... I bought it to encourage tummy time... She is just not intrested... she is 6 months now and will look at it, see herself and look for something to play with... sometimes she will pick it up and throw it... It is also very hard to get it to stand up... if she touches it at all, it will fall over, the thing is no good when it is lying down... it's just not intresting..."
4,My daughter loves it!,Right now I have this mirror in her crib. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ties that tie it to the crib are really annoying... velcro would be better. My daughter loves the spinning ball and bats at her reflection in the mirror. It's a great toy for the crib and I'm sure she'll continue to enjoy it outside the crib.
3,Waste of money,"I received this toy for my son when he was still in the womb. He is now 6 months old and he still doesn't have an interest for it. I don't know if it's just him or what, but he didn't seem to take to it very much."
3,OK for what it is,"Bright colors and tactile toys make it an eye catcher and it has a nice large mirror area which is reasonably non-distorting compared to other similar products I looked at. Baby likes to grab at the ring and chew and shake it around for the noises but she doesn't seem particularly attracted by the mirror though she loves mirror play in general. I think this is because it is hard to position it well for her. Tied to the crib she can only look at it sideways laying down and the easel feature is very unstable - it doesn't open very far and as soon as she touches it, it falls over. It's actually turning into more of a kick toy than anything else, which is where she gets most amusement value out of it. The most irritating thing for me is the tie fastening - I have to take it off the crib every nap and bed time otherwise she keeps herself awake with it, and it's a nuisance to keep tying and untying it it, velcro would have been much more practical."
5,still a winner!,"I bought this toy for my son when he was almost 6 months, and it is still a favorite at 14 months. We have it attached to his yard gate play area, but before that it was a stand-alone-hit. My son loves looking at himself in the mirror, and he also likes touching all the attachments. The toy has paid for itself over and over again in. It is a toy that babies just can't resist!"
5,Great toy,I got this for my baby girl at two months and she loved looking at herself in her crib. Now she is 7 months and loves to chew and play with the toys. I sit up on her playmat and she has a great time with it!
5,My child LOVES it!,I bought this for my 6 month old. She loves to sit and stare and smile at herself in the mirror. She also likes to bite on the toys that are attached to it. This is a cute mirror. I would recommend it. :)
2,Mirror could be better,"Received as gift...mirror quality could be a lot better. The Baby Einstein Mirror Me book has better mirrors on every page than the mirror in this toy. Plus, toy doesn't stand up by itself although it is designed to. It fell down countless times...a few times on our son. I would buy the mirror from Lamaze instead if given the choice."
5,Our son loves this mirror!,"Our 3 week old has enjoyed this mirror from day one. We have it on his changing table and as soon as we put him down on the table, he turns towards it to check himself out! This mirror makes changing time fun and easy!"
5,My daughter's favorite toy!!,My husband bought this toy of our baby when she was only 2 months! He said that she needed it! She took to the toy right away and would play with it forever! She is now 7 months old and this toy is the first thing she goes for. I don't think she will ever grow out of it. I like the additional toys that are on it too. Good job Daddy!!
3,BEST AS A CRIB MIRROR,"We bought this mirror specifically for ""tummy time."" However, tummy time lasts about 2 seconds with this mirror since it is so lightweight and easily knocked over. Our 2 1/2 mo. old constantly topples the mirror onto his head swinging his arms around (and has done this since he was about 3 weeks old). The toys attached to it block part of the mirror. I find myself constantly trying to find something to attach it to and/or rearranging our baby's position so he can even see his relfection.I recommend this mirror be affixed to the crib with its strings (it does have strings, but they're hard to see in the picture above). When babies began to roll, scoot, and crawl around the crib, the soft material definitely does not pose a hazard. When tied to the crib, it's also designed to aim downward."
4,"Good product, but need some improvements","My baby girl like it a lot in her crib, but if I put it on the floor is hard to stand still, I guess is a crib-only product."
4,Colorful entertaiment piece... but,"My son loves to gaze at this colorful, fun shaped mirror but since this item was made to be tied to his crib, the purple (detachable) bird and the teething ring will not extend far enough for my son to play with. Both purple bird and teething ring are attached to the console via nylon ribbon. I really wish the designer would place the bird and teething ring dangling at the same edge so it is easier for infants to grasp and chew on."
2,"Colorful mirror, but does not stand up","I purchased this mirror for my 3 month old to play with on the floor. To my disappointment, she knocked it over several times during its first use. It's very colorful and a nice size, but it is not at all sturdy on the ground. I would not reccomend this for play time on the floor."
3,Squirrel Toy,My cats went crazy at first then forgot about it. Catnip needs to be refreshed or the attraction fades.
5,Kitty loves to kill the squirrel,"My cat is crazy about this toy. I filled the squirrel with the included catnip, firmly secured the velcro, and the kitty is beyond pleased. He takes it under the couch and mauls it, then sometimes bring it out to toss it into the air for good measure. I'm happy that the velcro holds securely, with no catnip spillage into the house. This is a great toy for cats to play with on their own, when their people don't have time to make the cat charmer wand dance."
5,Cat secretly loves it,"I got this after reading all the other reviews as my cat is very picky about what she will play with. The first time I gave it to her, she rolled around with it and then sat on it for a while. After that, I never see her with it. However, it's in a different spot every morning. I find it downstairs in the dining room one morning and then in the upstairs bedroom the next. So, I'm thinking she secretly loves this toy every night, but doesn't want to let me know."
3,not necesarily for every cat,"I don't want to detract too much from what is obviously a quality cat toy. But its not ""da bird""- a toy that seems to work with any cat. My cat seems to prefer bird-like toys and no amount of catnip or cuteness from this toy is going to change that fact.From an owner perspective I've seen my cat go for this toy more than the usual ""dead animal"" toy, and it seems like a durable toy, but its not a guarantee that your cat will like it."
4,Fun Toy,"We have two cats. They enjoyed this toy a lot...for about ten minutes. That's actually quite a lot for these cats. Just like most cats they have short attention spans. They definitely did not ignore it -- one of them tossed it up in the air a few times and the other one attacked it in a very playful manner! They do go back to this toy on occasion and play with it again. Generally it was a pretty good hit. As for quality of the product, it appears to be safe -- no loose parts and good construction. The pouch for the catnip appears to be secure (the cats have not opened it yet). It was shipped very quickly and came in excellent condition."
4,Snuggle Buddy Only,"Sadly my cat does not play with this toy. He will however use it for a pillow quite frequently. He is very respectful with it, almost like he thinks it's a small animal and he's afraid of hurting it. I wish he would play with it though :-( I am giving this toy a good rating because I know cat toys are hit or miss depending on your cat's personality and it IS a well constructed, attractive toy. I have a large British Short Hair (15 lbs) and I think if he CHOSE to play with it, he wouldn't destroy it immediately."
3,Catnip Squirrel,This is another catnip impregnated toy we bought which has had no appeal whatsoever for our cat. Once again I think the catnip has to be old or non existent so I'll use some of the liquid cat nip on it which I have yet to purchase. I believe it will do the trick with the addition of a few drops.
3,Cute toy but cat not too crazy about it,"I really like this toy and think it's adorable, but my cat is not too crazy about it for some reason."
3,Kong Catnip Cat Toy Squirrel,"It is an ok toy, but not what I would call a 'must have.' Our five cats do not seem to play with it any more than their other toys, even with catnip inside."
5,Cats love it.,"My cats have abused this toy extensively. For some reason they like to throw their toys in the water bowl. Why do they do that? Maybe they think their toys need a bath? Anyway, they like carrying it around and seem to enjoy drowning it in their water bowl which can be a problem when you've got catnip in the hidden pouch. I only wish I could let the cats outdoors to take care of ""real"" squirrels that have taken over our neighborhood."
3,"Not exciting, but sturdy.","Our cat will play with the little stuffed animal for a minute or two when we offer it. She holds it down with her feet and pulls the hair out of the tail. She soon loses interest. The toy, as others have said, is very small. It's body is about four inches long. It seems to be well made. It has a deep pocket for holding catnip with very secure velcro that stays closed while in use. For our cat it's best used as a temporary distraction. Sometimes that's ok."
4,Even passive cats love this!!!,"I concur with many of the reviewers regarding their positive comments on this product. Having two cats that were quite passive, I was amazed at how this toy animated them. They were absolutely overjoyed at this toy and even fought each other (complete with hissing) for it. One became so attached he even brought it to his sleeping area and slept with it!!The only negative (and hence why I give it four instead of five stars) is that the product could have been made a little more durable as the cats really chew and claw it - hence a more durable build material should have been used (i.e., tougher, fabric base)."
3,incorrect product information,"I try not to buy anything made in China and emailed the store to see where the product was made - I received a reply assuring me that the item was made in the U.S. Then I purchased and subsequently received the item and it clearly states on the packaging as well as the tag of the toy itself, that the item was manufactured in China. This merchant can't be trusted and I won't make any other purchases from this merchant in the future. P.S.: the only reason I gave the product 3 stars, is that my cat likes it, but I am leery about any hazardous materials that might be in the toy, which could hurt my cat."
4,Top 2 Cat Toys,"This is one of my cat's top two toys so far (with the other beingPet Buddies PB1003CS Cat Nip Tea 2 pack Poly Bag. Both are worth a try, if you ask me! My cat goes crazy for 'em!"
3,Cat liked it for a few days,"Now it just kind of sits in the dusty corner of a room. I'd say go with a good catnip...this is similar to the cat-stuffed toys you find at K-Mart, Jewel or Walmart."
3,Just Ok!,I have four cats and 1 of them played with it for about a day or two. My dog ended up taking possession over it and plays with it more than the cats. I think it is a little too large for a cat to enjoy.
3,My cat likes it,I don't know how long it will last. Some of the fur and string from the velcro is coming off already. But it's good.
5,Cats love it!,My cats love the squirrel. My ferrets hid it somewhere though.. so might need to buy another. I love that youi can add catnip so it stays loved by cats.
5,I wish all cat toys were this popular,"Both of my cats love this squirrel and will hug him, toss him, beat him up, and sleep with him. His belly pouch actually stays firmly closed, which is grat as I don't want catnip all over the floor. Based on my cats' 5-star reviews of the squirrel, I bought a couple more for my mom's cat and sister's cat, who wholeheartedly agree. Four cats, 5 stars all around. I've never found another cat toy this universally popular."
1,my cats do not like this toy,My cats do not like this toy. I've had it for a few weeks and never see them playing with it. I would not recommend it.
2,A dud,"When I introduced this toy to my cat he just glared back at me with a ""you must be kidding"" look and just strolled away, leaving me holding it like a fool. Later, I saw him biting it a few times but hasn't developed any further interest in it. It didn't cost much so no great loss. Just with all these positive reviews I had to write. I don't think catnip appeals to him."
3,Cat did not love,Not sure why but my cat must not like catnip because he will hardly touch this toy. It is a nice quality and comes with a large amount of extra catnip. It is easy to pick up and play with. I would recommend if your cat likes other catnip toys.
4,cat loves it,my cat got to the toy before i even got it out of the packaging for him. plays with it for hours. i found him curled up with asleep last night lol
5,My cats love it,I have two 9 month old kittens. At first they didn't show any interest. But within minutes they were playing with their squirels.I know that some kittens won't show any interest in this toy.I recommed this toy.
5,One word: Awesome,"My cat loves to get in the window and watch the animals run around outside. But since we live in town I have decided to make him an inside cat b/c I worry that he will be run over. He spends his days dreaming of going outside and playing (more likely killing) the neighborhood squirrels ( I tell him that they are city squirrels and therefore much tougher than him, lol.) But with this toy he is content to stay inside and throw around, chase and rabbit kick this squirrel. He sometimes will open the hiding place and take out the catnip packet and eat the catnip when he rips open the bag, but he will still play with the squirrel without any catnip at all. I also bought a dog shaped toy by this same company and he loves to do the same thing with it too. (A little payback for all cats out there.)"
2,very playful toy,The catnip drives the kitties crazier than usual. Put on your leather gloves and try and get it away from them.
1,Big Disappointment!,"After watching my cats all excited over the squirrels at the birdfeeders outside their window this winter, I was looking forward to getting them their own ""squirrel"" to play with. This toy looked perfect, and they loved it, but within five minutes they were pulling ""fur"" loose from its tail and swallowing it. Even I with my arthritis could pull the ""fur"" loose. Now the cats are wondering what happened to their neat new toy, and I'm thinking I won't be ordering any toys from Kong again."
3,When nothing else to do...,"I have a foster cat in the house, and she is well taken care of. I buy her a lot of toys, and this I thought was cute. When I got home with it, she could smell the catnip, and could hardly wait for me to get it out of its bag. She took it, shook it, dragged it out on the floor, and there it is, with all her other toys. When she is bored (which isn't often), she will go over to it, play with it a bit, bite down on it and shake it, then drop it. I had high hopes for this toy, as she seemed very pleased with it in the beginning. I think a cat that is less spoilt with toys may find this interesting.That being said, this kitty loved to fetch, and would rather do that."
4,Great Toy,"Both our cats took to this toy immediately and have since had loads of fun carrying, hiding and smacking it about all around the house."
5,Classic Rock,As always this classic rock selection is a GREAT ADDITION to anyones collection. Bad Company never gets old and will always be a legendary rock band
5,Classic Rock at it's best,"If you are a fan of Classic Rock, then you have to have this in your collection. Bad Company was one of the best hit makers of the genre.And this collection, while not totally complete, is a fairly good retrospective of there biggest hits. I distincly remember when this group formed from members of other groups at the time. Their first hit was entitled ""Bad Company"" and when the band was called ""Bad Company"" I thought this would be a one-hit-wonder. But I was wrong and the group put out some great classic rock tunes and they have not aged at all."
3,10 From 5,"This album should be titled ""10 From 5"" as no tracks were included from ""Burnin' Sky"". . . an oversight if you ask me, as the title track from that album is my favorite Bad Company song. A more comprehensive single disc compilation is long overdue."
3,"Not Free, but pretty good.","I've always been a big fan Of Free and Paul Rodgers, so I thought I would give this CD a try. The songs that I knew and liked, were still the only songs I liked after hearing this through several times. It's not a bad CD, but their biggest hits were really the only ones I liked, so I find myself skipping over a lot of songs. I recommend any of the CD's from Free. Half of Free is in Bad Company, so it tells you how great Andy Fraser and Paul Kossoff were. This CD is certainly not a waste of your money, especially for true Bad Co. faithful."
4,Perfect 10,"I am not a huge fan of Bad Company, but they are a band that received significant air play while I was growing up in the 80s. This album has all those songs plus a few others. If you want a nice selection of all the Bad Company hits this is the perfect '10'."
4,"Classic bands classic tracks, but missing a whole album","As a fan and collector of everything Paul Rodgers has done I had to buy this album. It's got some of the best music he's done so far on it and as such it's brilliant. However Bad Co also have a whole album that didn't get a look in on this compilation of their greatest hits. For that error alone I took off one star. If you want a brief overview of a great band then this album is for you, if you want to appreciate the band properly buy all the albums or get the new box set. A bargin box gem, but falls short of what a true fan would want."
3,"Good, but no banana.","No one could argue that this CD contains some of the best ROCK music ever. Unfortunately, the remaining Bad Company boys decided to mix this one themselves, instead of using a producer. And it shows. Next time, leave it to the proffessionals lads."
3,"10 from 5, like the others say!","Bad Company's greatest hits complation 10 from 6, covers their career up to 1982. Their are 10 songs from 5 of the six albums they had out at the time. Besides being a skimpy hits collection, it doesn't really have their very best stuff. Runnin with the Pack please! To have Bad Company's best buy Bad Company, Straight Shooter, and 10 From 6(this one only because it has some of the highlights from the weaker albums that followed the first two)."
3,Not enough hits!!!,"This has some great Bad Co. classics, but leaves to many classics aside!!! Where's Burnin Sky, Silver Blue and Gold,Rock Steady, Good Lovin Gone Bad and Youngblood? They are not to to found on this CD!!! 5 stars for the music!!! 1 star for the CD!!!"
2,Plenty of talent with little inspiration,"As a few people have pointed out, the title is a little misleading as only 5 of their albums are covered here. Has anyone noticed, though, that on the coloured track guide they've included a symbol for ""Burning Sky"" despite the fact that none of its songs are included?!Anyway, if you really want the best of Bad Co you only need to buy their first two albums, as the rest is pretty weak. And to think, Mick Ralphs actually left Mott the Hoople to form this hugely overrated band..."
3,"Bad Company deserved at least 74 minutes in a ""best of"" CD","What's here is great, what's missing is a lot."
1,Bad Company certainely lives up to their name,"I received this album as a gift. I put into the CD player then I realized that someone played a joke on me. This album is quite horrible. I can't believe these souless, mundane and pathetic songs are what they consider their best. I will admit that their older stuff is better than their new song ""Move on"" which sounds like a real bad garage band. I will say this CD makes a good drink coaster which I'm currently using mine for. Lets all pray that Bad Company goes back into retirement soon. And stays there."
4,"""Bad"" to the bone.","Basically, this is a great collection for any fan of the band, or of classic rock in general. Though it's short (it did come out in the vinyl era), seven of these ten tracks are known to anyone who has listened to radio in the past 20 years. Track after track is solid 70's rock. ""Shooting Star"", ""Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy"", and ""Bad Company"" are all on here. Plus the huge hit ""Feel Like Makin' Love"", which was recently covered by ""Kid Rock"". If you dig artists like ""Bob Seger"" and ""Foreigner"", you'll like ""10 From 6""."
2,More like 10 from 5...,"As one reviewer put it...""At only ten songs, this has to qualify and one of the chintziest anthology albums ever assembled by a major rock artist"". How true that is but remember, the LP version came out in the pre-CD days.Extra tracks could have been added to the CD version. But then the title would have had to be changed (to ""15 from 6"" or whatever number of songs were on it).But the LP title was wrong anyway, there are no songs from Burning Sky on ""10 from 6"". So in reality, this album should have been called ""10 from 5"" all along.But the point is moot as the 2 CD set was recently released renedering this CD obsolete. Well, almost obsolete. ""10 from 6"" does contain 2 songs (Live for the Music and Electric Land)not on the new Bad Co. double CD anthology.Skip ""10 from 5"", buy the new 2 CD set (3-1/2 stars as the new songs are nothing special)."

4,Classic Company!,"Here is a must for all those classic rock fans who want to hear a little punch in vocal talent, and awesome guitar and bass riffs.This compilation is from their first six albums from the '70s and early '80s and goes well with any long trip or lazy day. It grooves!"
5,Cheapest around the internet,"I looked all over the internet for this item and found it in several company's but this was the cheapest, I bought this item from the same company before and am very satisfied with the item. The Chevrolet dealer wants more than 3 times what I paid for it. As far as I'm concerned it does the same job of filtering as what I previously bought from the dealer, I recommend it."
4,Art and Poetry,"Melinda Camber Porter offers a unique visual and lyrical flowering of emotion and space. She touches the core of love, togetherness, longing, and pain.She is subtle, and sometimes not at all. A fabulous journey of the art of words and words as art..along with her own paintings, which are mirrors for her verbal eloquence.""In the rush of the firstRiver rainAnd the old landscape appears out of the blue mist.""Passages like these bring to life the moments within the words that most do not look deeply enough to birth. She midwives incredible, feverish, and stark beauty."
2,Not all glass...several broke upon opening of package,"I ordered two assortments of these glass beads. They are very pretty beads. BUT, at least 15 of the beads broke upon taking them from the packaging. Also, quite a few were not glass but were some sort of clay (fimo or other brand). If I wanted clay beads, I would have made them myself, at least they wouldn't have broken as easily. I wasted almost $40. All together, I ended up with maybe 10 usable beads out of the two orders."
1,NOT specifically designed for the Sony NP-FH100,"This item is NOT specifically designed for the Sony NP-FH100, however I have been assured that it will work. The seller was GREAT but I wanted to post this note here for future buyers to be aware of the potential item issue."
1,carefully followed instructions,Despite carefully following instructions there were several small bubbles and one large one which could not be smoothed out. After removing the clear cover it could not be reused since the large bubble had damaged the cover.
4,Best Nuge Album of The 80's,"Very cool groove to this album. The Title track is the best on the whole album. This is an album you wanna crank up when both windows are down and you're cruisin' the highway. The 80's saw Nuge change w/ the times, as well as many other 70's groups like KISS, COOPER, AEROSMITH, OZZY, ETC. Definantly if you buy any Nuge from the 80's album get this one. ""Painkiller,"" ""Angry Young Man,"" ""Take Me Away,"" and ""Strangers.,"" along w/ the title track are the best cuts on this album. MUST FOR NUGE FANS!!!"
4,"it fit`s, still rock`s","I first heard little miss ""D"" on miami vice when they entered a strip club, and it`s stuck with me since. this music is 80`s that`s when it was made. but when you hear his version of ""little red book"" you will rock hard, even if it`s a remake,it`s better now, only NUGENT could pull it off......"
2,"I like it, but I don't love it","Little Miss Dangerous has some good Ted Nugent tunes on it. It does not however, compare to great albums like Cat Scratch Fever or Free For All. It doesn't sound like Ted singing on most of the LMD songs, is that him? Maybe the vocals are very ""processed"" in an 80s way. I don't know. I really like the title track, and High Heels In Motion is super catchy and rockin'. I also like Strangers and the cover of Little Red Book. I remember the vinyl of this album sounded horrible- very distorted like the levels were set too high in the recording studio and too much treble - the CD remaster has not really fixed those problems the production is still poor. All that being said, if you like Ted Nugent I do think this is worth getting, but after you have his debut, Free For All, Cat Scratch Fever, State of Shock, and maybe a couple of others."
1,This Album is Just plain Bad,"Wow, this album is terrible. Ted has really slipped since the 1970's and 1980's. Light your money on fire before you use it to buy this crap."
4,Great information in this book,When we purchased our new home there was much to be done. Because it was an older home lots of items needed to be completely over-hauled. With this book's illustrations and instructions it made many of our home dec/sewing projects a breeze.
1,A miserably dated book,This book will only help you if you want your home tolook as if it was done in the early 1990s. It is very dated.
4,The Entrepreneur Magazine Small Business Answer Book : Solut,"A succinct book that covers just about everything in a readable way. It stands out amongst other small business books with its hard core advice on important elements for success. A couple examples, the entrepreneur's responsibility to develop an accountable culture, and future forecasts for small businesses to keep up with our changing world. Good for those who don't have time to read a tome on the subject."
4,early bogie,"warner brother's had a stable-full of actors that graduated from the school of hard knocks w/. edward g. robinson,james cagney and humphrey bogart.While sharing the billing w/. Sylvia Sidney and Joel MacCrea,Bogart smolders w/. menace as his 'coming home party' fails to live up to his expectations.Cozying up to street urchins the Dead End Kids,Bogie hatches a plot to make his visit worthwhile. At the end is the inevitable showdown between the forces of hope (Joel MacCrea),good (the cops)and evil(Bogie)."
2,ok but not that great,It was an ok movie. Bogie did well. The film was typical of the times. Definitely one of his minor pictures.
5,A thumbs Up For Dead End!,Love old movies like these. Black and white classics.Enjoyed Humphrey Bogart in this!East side kids were great also!
1,poor translation,"This may have been a good movie at one time but the words did,nt match there mouthes moving.Somthing got lost in the translation."
5,Terrific Book!,"A great recipe book to get those extra fruits and vegetables in your diet. Well written, nice layout with some wonderful, mouthwatering pictures. Some delicious recipes that aren't quite the ordinary, but yet aren't so different you're afraid to try them....or can't find the ingredients. Highly recommended!"
2,Just ok,"I borrowed this book from the library and it was just OK. I didn't find any recipes I really liked, most of them were pretty simple just with added fruits and vegetables."
3,Ruth's Story about the book,"I haven' t read this yet - I red a review of it, both by Ruth herself for her Cottey College Alumnae paper (I am an alumnae there, too.), and by another alum, who is also an author, Rachel Roush. Rachel writes: I was delighted to get Ruth's book.I was amazed at how interesting she made this account of one little patch of the U.S. It's a work that combines meticulous research with warm human interest.Ruth wrote: ""I never had much time to indulge in my love of history.... I'd always listened avidly when my mother and grandmother talked of the pioneer days. But it wasn't until I had our children partially raised that I began my research. I'd go to Topeka to visit the State Historical Society, go through their files and read the county newspapers and take copious notes. While the (seven) children were in school, I'd go out and interview the early settlers, so much of the story is told in their own words. ..."""
3,Way too big!,"This slipper was very cute and stylish; however, I measure at a 10 1/2N. I ordered up and not only was it too long, it was also way too wide. My husbands slippers fit me better! I exchanged them for the 10N which fit much better; but I found to still be on the large side."
3,chicken licken,"I liked think that it was realy cool,funny and interesting. I would recomend you this book for children i think you will like it. this book is about a chicken that some thing fell on her head an he thoug that the sky was falling. She called her friends and they where going to tell the president and when hshe is on the airplane she was wrong th sky wasn't falling."
5,HASTE,This C.D. Is perfect for anyone! The lyrics are fit the music so well. I love this C.D. and I'll bet anyone who listens to it will too!
2,Laughable,"If you are ever bored, and need a good laugh, then read this book. The characters are so not believable. The story is all over the place. It is poorly written. And the plot is outrageous. Very disappointed. This book is so bad that is good. Good for humor, that is."
2,No recommendations!,"I struggled through this book. There was just way too much going on and a lot of it was just for shock value. Most of the scenarios were unbelievable. I wanted ao much to enjoy this book, but I just didn't!"
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!,I was very disappointed when I read this book. To me the book was too scattered. Although it had some funny parts I wouldnt recommend it to anyone
2,Rich and Creamy NOT!,"The cover is nice, but the story went on and on in areas that could have been abbreviated. I can tell this author is trying hard to anchor himself in the urban lit game, but that takes skill and I personally just don't feel this author is a writer. Great imagination, but a writer, no.I expected a juicier, sensual story based on the title and the cover. Nice effort."
5,This is a great deal.,My son loves Dexters and daugter loves PowerPuff Girls. This price can't be beat I wish more companies would sell them like this.
1,Laughable,"Nancy, Bess, George, and their respective boyfriends, Ned Nickerson, Dave Evans, and Burt Eddleton, head off for a camping trip on Shawniegunk Mountain, where Nancy hopes to catch sight of a rumored UFO. Along the way, the three couples, accompanied by their chaperones and trail guides, Hal and Jan Drake, run into enough trouble (including Indians, runaway horses, snakebites, and forest fires) to do in an entire wagon train. Nancy, undeterred, gets her hoped for sighting of the UFO as well as a bonus mystery in the form of an old man's hidden treasure.This book had no substance and no point - in addition to an already laughable premise. Some publisher out there should be very ashamed of himself."
2,Under my expectations,"Almost all of the Nancy Drew books I have read have been really good, but this one does NOT make the cut. There is practically no plot and hardly a mystery at all. The other Nancy Drew books are realistic and fun, but I think this one belongs in the sci-fi section. But if you like that stuff, go ahead.P.S. The best Nancy Drew's are the original ones: #56 and under."
4,A lurid paperback cover in motion,"A lurid paperback cover in motion. The color scheme, the subject matter, the sexy women - everything those great paperback covers of the fifties offered is delivered bigger than life in this great film."
2,THIS IS SCARY?,"I bought this because of all of the favorable reviews saying what a classic horror film this was supposed to be.I found it dull, even boring. The Carl Boehm character was so listless that I could hardly believe he was a killer. The picture just seemed to drag for me.The DVD does have some nice features though even if the aspect ratio is faulty.."
4,Cut by WB,"Warners cut all shots of nudity, photographs which were looked at by Miles Malleson were cut. The scene where Mark kills Pamela Green was cut. Its kinda important to the story by revealing his compulsion to kill was uncontrollable. Pamela made alot of disparaging remarks to him earlier in the film so its possible the murder was revenge. WB also messed up the framing by cropping the movie. Homevision vhs has the correct AR. The color looks too colorful. Its unrealistic. The British VHS has the correct color. Lets face it ... we're lucky to even have a movie with Warners attitude towards it. CUTTING / FRAMING / COLORIZING all are Alterations to the movie. Unnecessary alterations."
3,It's more of a good laugh then suspenseful!,"I saw some parts of this film. The suicide ending made me laugh really hard. It was just bad acting at the end. It was not scary, and I think it was trying to make a statement about our media culture going to the extremes. Mark seemed like the perfect sterotype of a mean German. I felt with the charachter when he wanted to kill the dancer and he kept rolling his eyes I wanted him to kill her too. It's good for laughs. If you want a good suspense film then watch Wait Until Dark."
3,Not Worthy of It's Reputation,"As a fan of Michael Powell's work ""Peeping Tom"" was a big disappointment. Not because of it's squeamish subject matter, rather, it just doesn't deliver the goods. There's alot of rhetoric here about voyeurism and cinephilia but it doesn't amount to much. The best I can say here is that Powell is still a master of color. Whereas other director's use black-and-white to ratchet a suspenseful mood Powell uses the full spectrum of colors to suggest horror. His use of the color red is interesting, particularly in a horror film where not a drop of blood is spilled. It was also nice to see Moira Shearer in an extended cameo doing an interesting Latin dance. Essential for Powell fans but I would recommend ""Peeping Tom"" to others with reservations."
2,It put me to sleep,"This movie is about a guy who carries a camera with him everywhere he goes. He starts to kill people with the end of his camera, the camera has a little knife attached to it. He also has some unresolved childhood issues.I tried watching this 3 times and everytime I tried I fell asleep within the first 25 min. Finally forced myself to watch the whole thing and it was hard to make it through.The characters are like walking zombies. The classical music playing during the 'murder' scenes is annoying and not scary. In fact theres almost continuous classical/piano music playing throughout the whole movie.Very boring actors, uninteresting characters, I was barely able to finish watching this. If youre interested in watching a guy take a camera in and out of his bag 20 times along with boring English dialogue and very lackluster suspense... watch it.. if not, dont even bother."
4,Fascinating,"Peeping Tom is a very interesting movie, however it is not for all tastes. It is quite a disturbing film. Although I recommend that you see it before purchasing it, I recommend that everyone should at least give it a try. It may end up being one of your favouite movies. Criterion has put together a very good collection of special features for this film, including an interesting documentary, ""A Very British Psycho"". Note that this film, despite being presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.66:1, will end up as 1.78:1 on widescreen televisions, as it will enlarge itself so that it reaches right to the left and right edges of the screen, therefore cutting off the top and bottom of the image."
3,o.k. i guess you should get it for your collection if:,"you are a true fan of film. i guess you can call this a classic, only because of it's age.this is not a horror film. it can't be compared to psycho or any other 'disturbed child going mad"" type movie. it is however a decent story that could have been much more. it's about some uber-accented german freak who captures everything on film, because his father used to film him as part of childhood studies. big friggin' deal. get over it. now the guy can't form any true relationships and ends up killing people. wah wah.like i said...if you are a true film collector then you can shell out the large amounts of duckets that criterion collections go for (because of extras-who cares). rent it before you decide to buy."
1,WATCH OUT FOR THE STEM@@@,"I bought this watch 3 yrs. ago from another company...when I went to set it, the stem, or winder (don't know exact term for it!) came off!!! I took it to a jeweler and they said the entire stem part had to be replaced, for $75!!!!!..he said he felt it was a defective watch when I bought it; not very quality control!!! I AM NOT SAYING this would happen if you purchase it now, but this was just my experience..."
2,"Buy a couple, you'll need them","I use these in a jasper circle jig to cut holes for mounting speakers. After 6 4.5"" circles the bit was already dulled enough to heat up and began burning the wood instead of plunging through it smoothly. There is also already grooves in the cutting edges that leave their shape in the cut edge of the material. Very disappointed... My Freud 75-102 was a far superior bit."
4,Live Papa,Having been a fan of this group since I purchased California Project some years ago I was unsure if the group could once again reach the level of excellence demonstrated in that album. To my surprise and given that this is a live recording the quality is excellent with smooth laying of tracks and that variation on a theme that is synonymous with live performances. If you like quality instrumentals mixed with excellent voacls then this is fantastic value. Highly recommended album.
2,Great selection of hits but lacking quality,"Papa Doo Run Run is a great band that has been around for decades. Their ""California Project"" CD on TelArc is outstanding. In concert, they sound better than the Beach Boys or Jan & Dean. However, this concert album recorded at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk falls short of expectations. While I enjoyed many of the selections, the audio sounded flat and uneven from song to song. In addition, unlike many concert albums, this one faded out and in between songs deleting any banter between group members and/or the audience. My sense of it is, this recording was a way to easily and cheaply put out an album without having to go into the studio and record a high quality list of songs. All in all, it was disappointing. If you want to hear this group at their best, get ""California Project."" The great tragedy of Papa Doo Run Run is that they haven't made a follow-up to ""California Project."" Let's hope they do soon."
4,Funny little flick,"FOUR DEAD BATTERIES won't blow your mind with cinematic delights, but it packs a mean comic punch. The guys in this movie talk like guys really talk (about sex, women, etc.) Take the ""R"" rating seriously here. Plus the DVD is really well-rounded for a microbudget movie like this. The ""Advice Track"" is very informative and wannabe filmmakers really shouldn't miss it.But the movie's the thing, and it's funny and clever, with good, fresh writing and a good cast (for a super indie)."
4,Nice Job Martinez - An Indie Well Done,I enjoyed it! Martinez did a nice job telling the story in all aspects. I would like to see what his next film may be and where he will take it.
3,French Christmas Songs,"The recordings on this album are quite old and have the pops and scratchy sounds of an old record that was played a lot. The style of the music is also very early 20th century (1920's to 1930's, I would guess) and can at times seem a little ""hokey"". If you like that nostalgic sound, then you may enjoy this album."
3,A bit of an anticlimax,"The book is in danger of being just a marketing aid to get you to part with a lot more cash to get the full program from the author.Whilst it makes interesting reading, it seems to go around in circles at times and in the end the book only teases you - which is fine, so as long as the reader is not misled from the start into thinking they might get something more substantial out of it.Being already a spiritual person, I found myself agreeing with some of what the book covers. However, some of the author's claims, such as the need to fulfil our higher purpose for the benefit of the planet do not seem consistent with the price-tag the author puts of that knowledge. Surely, given its importance, it should be more accessible.Otherwise a very interesting book - worth a read."
4,Love Love Love this book.,"This is a great read, period. I would reccomend it to anyone who might need a little pick me up in life."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,If I could rate this book a 0 stars I would but since I can't I will give it a 1 ....this is the most gibberish I have read in a long long time. I am a 4.0 graduate and still could not understand what the heck was he talking about. Plus it just led to spending more money on the tapes. Please folks don't throw away your money on this garbage...give it to a homeless person or something you will benefit more.I enjoy reading about becoming enlightened as the next reader but this could not enlighten a frog....
5,It'll change the way you see things,"I was never much into metaphysical experience seeking. But, I've always wondered, ""What else is out there?"" On a chance meeting in a coffee shop one night, I was given this book - and it has changed my entire outlook on life and the world around me. Every page gave me something new to think about ... and I still go back and re-read certain chapters from time to time. This book really gets you thinking about things most people don't really spend much time thinking about. It will change the way you see things."
4,Handbook of the Navigator,Like all of Mr. Pepin's books an easy read. The only reason I did not give it a *5* star rating was the wrap up seemed (to me) a little unfinished. Still a wonderful guide.
1,Beware!!,"I have just finished reading ""The Handbook of the Navigator"" and found that the book provided much insight into the higher consciousness of man. The most surprising aspects of man's higher consciousness that I discovered was at the end of the book when to my surprise I learned that the book was really a very expensive infomercial for their expensive meditation course-an infomercial that I paid them to produce. After all the high sounding words about helping their fellowman become truly aware I was disappointed to find that it was just another marketing gimmick and was really all about the money."
1,Nothing New In This Book,"Very disapointing. This book appeared to be only a huge advertisement to get you to buy more books from said company. Much, much better books out there, especially Disappearance of the Universe and The Power of Now. Actually, Carlos Castanedas' book are much more informative. Save your time and money."
5,So much knowledge for such a small book,"So much profound knowledge in these 262 pages, simply written, clearly explained.Herein lie the answers to life's greatest questions;""Where did God come from?""""What is the meaning of life?""""Why am I here?""""What is the purpose of my life?""If you have ever found yourself wondering these things, then open this book, and let Eric Pepin open your eyes.Note: it's an even better bargin in kindle foremat!What better companion for your new Kindle Fire, then a book that will fire up your imagination and spirituality."
4,"Check in to this ""Hotel""","Sexy, seductive, soothing ethereal electronica.Great background music for chilling, a late night drive, or, well, you know. :)The Gordon Brothers do it again; another flawless mix of global beats that will lift you up into the clouds and out of your daily stress."
5,Buddha-Lounge for the quiet times,"The sub-title for this album is ""The Intimate Side of Buddha-Lounge"". Seeing as how I love the Buddha-Lounge series, how could I not love this one, too? And sure enough, I really enjoy the same sweet mix, the choice of artists for this second series. The tempo is a little lighter and softer, but just as moving and, at times, intense."
5,Buddha bar Specialist,Opera to relax no 7 is worth the cd aloneBeautiful music for beautiful peoplebliss
1,Pass It Up,"I purchased the first Hotel Tara, which is Brilliant. Wonderful. One of my Favourites. So, when Hotel Tara 2 came out, I jumped at a continuum.This one is NOTHING like the first; almost all monotonal instrumental stuff with a rerun song at the end.Save your Money; purchase something else instead. I liked Lover's Lounge.. or Cafe Luna..."
2,Not clear on website,"I Thought I was ordering a music CD because it showed the album cover for Meet the Beatles on the website, but I received a DVD documentary movie instead"
4,Science ruined by politics,"While the plot was rather straight forward in hind sight, I found the technology aspect fascinating. I wish he had gone more in depth into the possible uses of the machine. All in all, a good book to get, if only for the more technical information. (The author does admit that he came up with this and isn't quite sure it will work. I think it shows promise. In about 100 years or so."
2,"For techheads only, and patient ones at that.","I kind of like Hogan. Unfortunately, I just finished rereading his ""Voyage from Yesteryear,"" which is vastly superior to this artificial intelligence tale. ""Realtime Interrupt"" is for techheads only, and those who love office and major-corporation politics. Both are covered in mind-numbing detail, while personal interactions and characterization get generally short shrift. Will the protagonist's cutting-edge AI project be shunted aside by corporate bigwigs in favor of a rival formulation that is very similar, but focuses on a higher level of the brain? Will the protagonist wind up trapped in a dead-end career path instead of making millions? If these kinds of questions fascinate you, you've come to the right place. This book might have satisfied me in 1960, but SF has moved on to a higher and better place since then."
2,Out to prove a point not revealed in the press package,"I haven't finished the book yet. I am determined to do so. But I find it tough to muddle through the obvious agenda which is to lay the blame for eugenics on liberal Christians, those who advocate for a social gospel, in other words, ""not really Christian."" This message is so heavy handed in the introduction, the afterword and the first two chapters, that her other points are lost. I am a special educator, very interested in the eugenics movement and expected a historical record. I was promised interesting character portrayals. Instead, so far, I get a condemnation of liberal Christianity. It is getting very old. I will try to persevere. Part II: I trudge painfully on. I ran a word search with my Kindle. The author uses the word liberal over 80 times. This is not a history of eugenics. If you knew little about the subject, you would probably be confused. This is a hatchet job on Liberal Christianity."
4,After update works good,"I could not get the deduction to import, so I called customer support. They answered in less than 1 minute! I told them the problem I was having. They sent me an email with the following link.[...]Downloaded the file ~16.9 MB. Ran the file (this un-installs, then re-installs the Deduction Pro 2006). I tried to import, still had the error. Opened deduction pro, opened the deduction file I was working on, and re-saved it. Tried to import again - NO problems :-). So if you are having problems, download the update. Run the update. Open your deduction file you started, and re-save it.I really liked the 2005 version better, I think this version is a little more difficult to figure out.So far - I am pretty satisfied."
1,Some apparent defects and poor support,"I had an issue with the error checker finding copy number problems when none existed. Online support told me to delete the forms and re-enter, which did not solve the problem. They kept cutting and pasting some verbiage that had nothing to do with my problem, insisting I try that. In the end I gave up after three separate sessions and ignored the warning. Online support resources were very thin, The online chat seemed good at first but could not go past standard cut and paste responses.Also, the interview was hard to re-enter after exiting to forms sometimes. Plus going back in the interview often jumped to the beginning of the section instead of one page back."
2,No support for Cap Gains Worksheet imports,"I am not happy. I just completed my 2005 taxes using Taxcut, after spending 5 hours needlessly - hand entering my cap gains (basis, dates, etc.) info. Taxcut doesn't support imports from comma delimited files, and Fidelity (my broker) tells me they declined to support their export service. I am VERY suspicious this is collusion with Microsoft and Gainskeeper which, for #49.95 a year (less than 100 trades - $149 for more), would enable this import. Although I have been a Taxcut customer for 10 years, unless this is corrected next year, I will be going to Turbo Tax (which supports the direct Fidelity imports)."
1,Businesses beware!,"As mentioned previously, do not forget to manually adjust schedule C to add your inventory levels to complete the cost of goods section. The phone support disconnected me, and online chat went round and round with me until I was convinced they had no idea what they were talking about. I used TurboTax last year, our first year of business, and their program prompted me on that issue, thankfully. I stood to lose $1000 of refund without it!"
1,TaxCut won't import from Fidelity or other investment firms.,"If you want to import information from your financial institution don't buy TaxCut this year. I used it last year to import information from my Fidelity Investments and American Century accounts and was really pleased because it saved me a lot of time. I purchased it this year expecting that it would continue to have that feature. When I couldn't figure out how to do it, I call Fidelity and they gave me the bad news. Still not convinced, I wrote an email to TaxCut (H & R Block) customer support and they wrote back saying that I would have to do it manually. They didn't even apologize. Now I am stuck having to enter 27 pages of stock and mutual fund transactions by hand or trash everything I have already done and buy TurboTax and start over. What they have done is deceptive at best. Who knows what other features they will decide to remove next year? Your best bet is to stay away from any of their software now and in the future."
1,Don't Use The State of MA Product if you have Kids!,I identifed an apparent error in the program - the program appears to calculate lines 12 & 13 in the State of MA return incorrectly (relating to dependents & dependent care). I waited almost 2 weeks to even get a response from H&R Block customer service (they promise a response in 48 hours)and the response I got didn't address the issue. They don't seem concerned about a potential program error that may cause any MA return with child care entries to be wrong. Very disappointing.
2,CA software disappointing,"I have been using Taxcut for about 10 years and always very satisfied before. However, this year I found the CA Part year Resident software to have several flaws and next year I will be switching to Turbo Tax. I found that the CA software did not carry forward, or ask me what share of my pension should be taxed in CA. this would have resulted in a significant under reporting of my taxable income to CA. subsequently I pulled down the CA instructions from CA and checked everything manually. I also discovered that the format shown online was not the format the part year form printed in. I submitted my taxes on January 31, so it could be that HR Block corrected these problems later, but ....One additional note: I emailed Taxcut with my concern, and a month later no response has been received."
1,does not work with NT,"It does not run under NT, this is not what is stated in the product description"
2,TaxCut 2005,I was very disappointed that this was not the latest version and required downloading from the site.
1,Do not buy H&R Block Tax Cut 2006 it has defects and poor support,I purchased Taxcut 2006 and it has errors and defects . After completeing 1040 form at the end when your using a SSA-1099 form the software asks for a Imployer I.D. when there is none and will not transmit to IRS unless the Employer I.D. number is entered. Called customer support and they could not deal with the problem and hung up on me . Could not download updtates for Deduction Pro 2006 message error came up DP 7007 and to redownload .After 6 times gave up and could not transfer figures from Deduction Pro 2006 to 1040 form got message deduction pro 2006 needs up date .Contacted HR block customer service at 1-888-482-9288 and Customer Service gave me a FTP download site when logged on to said no such site exsits . Requested a refund and sent a complaint to the FTC and Missouri Attorney Generals Office . Customer Service also sent over 20 surveys asking how they did as harrassment .Going to Turbo Tax next year
1,Review of TaxCut 2005+State,"This rating is for AMAZON's service as I have not tried the product yet.Product page says the item ""Usually ships within 24 hours. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com."" So, I ordered the item last week hoping that I would be able to do my tax this weekend. Today is the 6th day, the order status page states ""We are preparing these items for shipment and this portion of your order cannot be canceled or changed"". Now, I have to buy it elsewhere and return this to AMAZON. AMAZON did not keep its word. LOOK ELSEWHERE if you need it on time."
3,Decent Program,"This program was easy to use and figure out as it walked you threw step by step. i liked the fact that i could file over the internet and didnt have to mess with a bunch of paperwork. the only thing i didnt like is the length of time it took for my return to come back, yes it said 8-15 days and believe me they used all of the 15 days to return my money. i duno if i will do my own taxes next year or not, i am debateing on the 15 day wait or the money i have to give away to get my money back the next day."
1,It's not TurboTax :-(,"I found this software package very disappointing. I purchased it because it included a free e-file, and TurboTax did not this year.There were several key areas not covered in their ""Interview"". Also, it was quite annoying to have to stop what I was doing to go to their website to do updates. The update function did not work off the disk ( kept getting an error message, 3 tries over two different days ). I will purchase TurboTax next year whether they offer free e-file or not."
3,"Good, but diffused",This is a very informative and eye-opening book on the policies of Microsoft. What I didn't like in here is that a lot of material that has nothing to do with the main subject matter has been discussed at length. I don't understand why a whole chapter (out of a total of about 6) has been devoted to Mr. Gates' wedding. There is also some discussion on the history of the island where his wedding took place!
3,This is not news,"When you're the richest man in the world, how muchof an underdog can you possibly be? If you throwenough money at a problem, you can do things likesend a man to the moon, build nuclear weapons,and yes, even beat Netscape. Is it any surprisethat Microsoft is becoming a major player in theInternet? It's only a matter of time before Gatesmisses another parade, and then marches out infront and claims to lead it."
2,Difficult Read,"This isn't a patch on Hard Drive. Whereas Hard Drive was one of the best reads I've had, Overdrive is neither objective or intesting.It seems apparent that Hard Drive benefited substantially from having Jim Erickson as one of the authors.Overdrive is written by James Wallace alone. And it shows. His biased negative opinion of Microsoft shows through.Wallace is also not a very good writer.For example, when writing about the actions undertaken by the Justice Department to investigate Microsoft, Wallace documents boring details about which lawyers were involved, what their backgrounds were, etc., and he stretches this section out until it is completely out of place in this book.This is a difficult read because of the bias and poor writing ability of Wallace.<P"
4,Behind the scenes look at the King of the Software Industry,A very interesting book that will keep you reading from start to finish. Although the book dragged a little with all the Justice Dept's suits against Microsoft. It was still worth reading. I particularly enjoyed the wedding section of the book.
4,Elegance in a Jar,This stuff is heaven in a jar. Love it on pork and in salad dressings. Adds a level of complexity to dishes in one easy step. I bought it after I found out how many professional chefs use it!
1,White Truffle Honey tastes like garlic,"I ordered two jars of White Truffle Honey. If you think you are going to eat a mouth-watering spoonful of honey, think again! It tastes like garlic...ugh. We expected to use it in a recipe for a White Truffle Honey salad, mixed along with White Truffle Honey oil from a Napa Valley winery. What a disappoinment! Should have returned it for a refund."
1,no smell or taste of truffle at all,"This product says it is a truffle honey, but doesnt taste truffle at all. is came with some oil over it and doesnt taste truffle not even honey, Disgusting. Waste of money."
5,very adorable,These earrings are very adorable but very small. I am still giving them five stars though as they seem to be well made aswell as enchanting.
4,Great fictional expansion on the Bible story,"This is a fun read. Take the Bible story of Esther and Xerxes and expand it into a love story fit for a miniseries. This is fiction, but similar in take to what the Ten Commandments movie did for the Exodus story. A great gift for your wife or girl fiend... after you read it yourself."
2,ok,"well made, pockets aren't layed out very well at least not for myself that likes things a little organized, but manageable, my biggest issue is that its way bigger than i wanted for a secondary jam bag, my bad, should have read the details"
1,not what I wanted,"This is a graphic novel, not graphic meaning explicit, but meaning it looks like a comic strip. The main character is a woman, Ms. Tree. She's a private investigator looking into some violence against abortion clinics.I didn't like the format, I didn't like the characters, I didn't like the plot. But hey, you may love it. It's just not the sort of mystery I like at all."
3,Needed.,"The ball was perfect, unfortunately, the cost shipping was a bit excessive. I found the exact same ball at Kmart and with todays UPS bulk shipping I could have saved an additional $5."
1,Windmere buyers beware!,"This burner works great if it works at all. My first one lasted just under a year, so when it just quit working, I bought another one. Well, the second one only lasted a month, so I sent it back to the company (at my expense) and when I got it back (refurbished or maybe new? I'll call this my third) it lasted just under 3 months before it died in the middle of boiling eggs. It might be cheap, but in the long run, it's not worth it."
2,not ok,oh no i would never buy this doll oh gosh bratz dolls are ugly enough why did they have to make this freaky head? i dont find anything flattering about this...
5,An amazing journey,"It's hard to describe this book in normal terms. It takes the reader on an incredible journey to a place where the world we think of as real is penetrated by the world that we usually consider imagination. It will challenge you both with the events and ideas described and the author's extensive knowledge of the literature surrounding the kind of events we usually think of as impossible.Recommended for readers interested in applications of Jungian psychology, those with an interest in a different side of the feminine than we usually see treated in popular literature, and anyone who has an interest in how all these elements might connect in contemporary thought."
5,Great all-purpose knife,This is the knife I use most. I own three of them. I use it to slice baguette and rolls it also works well at the table for slicing cheese and cutting cakes. I like this because of the blunt tip. I have small children and do not want to have a pointy knife within their reach.
2,Works well but feels cheap,"I can't complain at all about how this knife works. I bought it for slicing tomatoes and bread and it works great. The problem is it just doesn't live up to my expectations of a Wusthof. I have a set of Wusthof Classic knives. When I hold a Classic in one hand and this Serrated in the other, the Serrated just feels cheap. Hard to explain. I like the knife at $15, but $30 is too much."
5,Great For Sandwiches,"I love this product! So much better than the regular thick rice cakes. They are thin, but very compact, so I use them as a great sandwich bread alternative. They don't break apart quick as easily as the regular rice cakes. I've searched the grocery and health food stores in my area and can't find this product anywhere. I love that they are now available for Subscription through Amazon.com."
1,Too Much Inorganic Arsenic,"Consumer Reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market. I like these crackers, but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved."
1,I bought this model twice. Neither lasted more than nine months.,This is the second model of this toaster I have purchased. The first one lasted about nine months. This one only lasted only three months. What went wrong? The first toaster shorted out: it sparked one day when I plugged it in and that was it. It never worked again. This last one worked alright for about eight weeks until the right side stopped working. Just this week the left stopped working.
4,A Family Circus Christmas VHS,Movie skipped and froze in a few spots. Cost was too high for the minor issues I encountered.
5,Read about this in Country Home magazine.,I believe Country Home wrote an article about these woman and pictured them and some of the quilts. I found it fascinating! It made me thankful for what I've got and showed me that beauty is everywhere -- its just a matter of how you interpret the world around you. Erin
3,Sigur lost,"For better or worse, it seems impossible not to intertwine this group and the work they contributed to higher powers with most of the sampler material they have on display here- dreamy background indeed though lacking enough identity or drive to not hold breath for the following full length."
3,Waiting for their LP,"I saw them live in Grand Rapids, MI opening for Sigur Ros and they were fab! Great tease of an album...am curious to hear what a full length album will sound like...their music has a soft-gentle quality, but moves into climax. This music asks great attention to detail."
1,AKAI IS A TERRIBLE COMPANY - DO NOT BUY!,"I purchased this DVD player and had problems with it. I sent it back for warranty repair 9 months ago. AKAI keeps on telling me that it will be shipped back shortly, BUT NOTHING!!!!!! I have called so many times that I feel like a fool. I guess I will just have to buy a new DVD player ... Save yourself the aggravation."
3,Akai DVDP5851 Multizone Multivolt DVD Player,"I would love to give this one 5 stars, because it is a great player, very versatile. However, after less than one year, our AKAI gave up the ghost: it will no longer read any disks. Reluctantly, I may buy the same model again, because I like the design, features, and price. However, one other thing that I like less that 100% is the very large a clunky remote. Such a slick player, such a goofy remote control!"
1,Cheap - be warned,"I guess you get what you pay for - this player is cheap with a cheap remote (that stopped working within one month), a cheap loading tray and pretty poor performance.Yes - it plays multi-region DVD's but when it plays them with pixelated images and you can't use half the functions because the remote doesn't work, this player becomes a bad buy.Plus, the warranty from the seller was only 15 days.Avoid this player and get something decent. There are too many reviews like this for this player. Be warned."
5,More Twists and Turns,"Another sassy addition to the clique series, Lisi Harrison has once again made me read a story non-stop. This book is full of twists and turns, while still being very grabbing to her detail-oriented audience. At the end, the clique girls are in for another surprise..."
5,Amazing,"This book was so good. It sucked you in as you read it. It was funny,creative,fun and a great read. I lov Lisi Harrisons Books.I rate this 10 out of 10I recommend this book to anyone!"
4,A good continuation of the series,My teenage daughter has been reading these books and highly recommends them. This book is definitely up to the standards of the other books in this series.
4,Review,This was a good book and I love the clique series but this one was a bit far fetched. I would recommend it to others espeially if you liked the first 4 books!
5,Best Book In Seires post : 4evateen21,This is Madeline Monroe speaking as 4evateen21. I give u the juicyness of the stories and tell u the real truth of how a teen girl wud like this book. Its baisaclly about youn romance and fashionand it is for teens. Any girl with some style some experiance with boys and friends would enjoy this book. Personally its my favoritw book in seires. LuV YAz 4evateen21
5,A Must Read for all teen grls,I absolutely love this series and this new one is the best by far !!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait for the next one. Massie and Derrington and Claire and Cam!!!! It's sooo cute :p
5,i luv this book!!,"when i first saw this book, i thought it would be another one of those same, old, never-ending popular book about the lives of popular girls, but i was dead wrong! i was bored and started reading the first book and i was hooked! i couldn't drop the books... and i'm not that big of a reader. this book is my favorite one so far... i think. i'm not done with the series yet. the book shows that although some girls can look cool and pretty on the outside, they do have the problems that other girls may have and the solutions are crazy and entertaining. i luv this book and the other clique series book. read it! =]"
5,EMYGAWD!!!!!!! THEEEEEE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was theeee best book ever.it totally reflects on being a 12 year old and stressing over stuff like boys and popularity. I would highly reccomend it to anyone who is bored with books or someone who LOVES to read!!!!!!!!! So far, i think revenge of the wannabees was the best though altough this comes in seccond.anywayz, here's wat's haapening: the ocd girls and briarawood boys go on a camping trip to lake placid and massie starts something called M.U.C.K. short for massie's underground class for kissing. i think. i'm not totally sure. but she dosen't have any expierience. i'm not gonna say anything else cause i want you guys to find out! i can't wait for dial l for loser!!!!! i'm gonna die of waiting!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Poor Judgment,"The book came in with extra features. The previous owner was a library. The book had different types of stains on it and in it. The previous readers loved to eat, drink, and read a lot. If I had a chemistry lab for my child, she could have some fun guessing what they were. Grant it, it was a used book but, I wouldn't ship a product to a customer and make them throw it away. Trash is trash, my house is not a recycling facility. You try to save a tree by buying used books that may have under lined sentences here and there or bent pages. Maybe even some highlighted sentences. But food and drink is an unacceptable bonus of bacteria in my book. No pun intended. Ok maybe just a little."
5,My Awesomely Helpful Review LoL,"I loved this book! It was ah-mazing, in the words of Massie!! This book was all about TPC going to Lake Placid for a fieldtrip and who else is going you ask?? The Briarwood boys!~! The girls learn about kissing in Massies M.U.C.K.(Massie's Underground Clinic for Kissing!) And it backfires in her face! Read the book to find out more!! All in all an ah-mazing book!!!!!"
1,dont waste your money,"this book was gross! it was extremely stupid1 i shouldn't have ever wasted my money on it!!!!! the book really isn't approreate for 7th graders, all 5 of the books are not good."
1,THIS BOOK IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR 7TH GRADERS,"THIS IS FROM A PARENT who happened to pick up this book at my 14 year old niece's house and I was apalled by this book. PARENTS BEWARE OF THESE BOOKS!! If you want to feed your little girls ideas and thoughts about sexual behavior, then buy them this book. If you want to protect your children's innocence. . . do not buy this book. IT IS VERY SEXUAL IN DISCUSSIONS with even the mention of ORAL SEX being ""third base"". I know most reviews from the kid's are good reviews, BUT ARE THE PARENTS READING THIS FILTH BEFORE GIVING IT TO THEIR YOUNG DAUGHTERS. This book made me very sad and after reading all the reviews by young girls it made me even sadder. This is not what we should be filling our young girls' minds with. Not to mention the using God's name in vain - - even though they spell it Gawd. Lord please forgive them!!"
1,Idiots Posted the Wrong Book Description,ok they either have the wrong description or the wrong photo/title. the review is for Invasion of the Boy Snatchers. com'on people!!!XP only 1 star for the idiots at amazon.
5,A giant cliffhanger,"The book The Pretty Committee Strikes Back by Lisi Harrison, was a great book. I loved it! My favorite things about the book were the characters and the writing.The characters made the book so much more interesting. They were so fun to read about. They were rich, popular, and boy crazy. Their problems were mainly about boys and popularity.The next thing I liked about the book was the writing style. I loved it how the author used text messaging and instant messaging. It made me understand how realistic it was. It used text messaging and instant messaging a lot. The writing made the book sound so much more interesting. It got me more involved into the book.This is why I really enjoyed reading the book The Pretty Committee Strikes Back by Lisi Harrison. It doesn't only have great characters and a great writing style but it also has a great story with it. I would recommend this book to anyone from ages 10-13 looking for a great read."
5,This was great,"I loved this book. I could not put it downIt was so suspensful,I loved how it ended, and I cant wait for the next book to come out"
5,TPC: U Rock!,"here's the basic info about the story.Massie: Is madly in love with Derrington but has to lose the lip virginity. forms M.U.C.K. but the girls find that she's a fake.Kuh-laire: Wants the gummies from Cam and a kiss from him. but first, he has to forgive her about the Josh Hotz biz...Alicia: crushing on Josh without a clue that claire already kissed him. wonder what happens when she finds out.Dylan: wants to divorce her mom for cuddling with her geo teacher. disgusting!Kristen: cant afford it, so she decides to sneak over to lake placid, hide under massie's bed and read trail maps.wanna know the rest of the story? read the book. im not spoiling the fun for u guys!"
3,The Clique #5,"I don't know WHY I love these books. Massie is SUCH a brat...the way she talks to the teachers makes me SO mad. The book basically makes it seem like if you are rude, mean, and have top designer clothing you'llbe popular.ANYWAYS, despite all of that, I really enjoy the books. They're like this thing that I REALLY shouldn't like, but I really actually love. The end was SO surprising, and I can't wait for the 6th one to come out. You really should read this book, it's a quick and easy read, and it's good. I just wish the message would change, and Massie would learn how to treat ""her elders"""
3,Okay,"This is a good book. It is a bit addicting, and you might not be able to put it down. Good for Tween or Teen. But, watch out--there are some cheesy and/or unrealistic parts."
4,Likable Sequel.,"Buddy has become a well known dog, while his Master (Kevin Zegers) has become a teenager. Now the Teen has discover Buddy could also play Football! Now two Russians (Nora Dunn & Perry Anzilott), who steal animals and Discover Buddy Talent and wants to steal the animal to bring back with them in Russia.Directed by Richard Martin (Canadian T.V. Director) has an entertaining Sequel, Kids will enjoy this One. DVD`s has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33:1) Aspect Ratio and an Clear Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD`s only extra is The Original Theatrical Tralier. Good family fun. Grade:B+."
1,Yet Another Predictible Sports Movie,"Mighty Ducks was good, but now with all of these sports movies and endless sequels you know one like this will be no different. Here's the plot: Dog, Divorce, Big Game I know they sound like keywords but shamefully its the plot. The animal catchers???Sombody has seen Homewardbound 2 and tried to make it funnier, they did a worse jodb then Home2!!!!!!!!!! This mpvie is just to predictible. Also stay clear of: D3"
1,Dogs don't play football,"Dogs do not play football people play football. I think this movie is mocking those young athletes saying that ""A dog can play sports better then you, so give up you failure""."
5,Buddy Plays Football.,"Josh And Buddy Are At It Again. This Time They Go Out For The Football Team. The Coach Picks Them To Be On His Team. Josh And Buddy ""The Dog"", Again Helps His Team Win The State Championship, But Before The Game, Buddy Gets Trapped By These 2 Monsters, But Buddy Finds His Way To Get Out And He Finds Patrick And Patrick Takes Him To The Game. What A Great Movie."
4,Stephen King has done it again.,"""The Library Policeman"" is a thrilling story of a man and his bad trip to the library, and of what is to come. The book has great detail and well developed characters. The horror of such things could only come from a great writer like Stephen King. The book is fast reading and makes you grip the pages with suspense. Ardelia is a a monster from my deepest nightmares. I love how King incorporates children into the story, and makes them the victims giving it a more horrific feeling of what Ardelia is doing. The whole story sent chill's down my back. The library in the story, is so twisted and scary that I love it. The story shows a great case of coping with your fears in order to over come a bigger picture. If you like creatures that you have never imagined like the Library Policeman, then i suggest trying "" The Langoliers"", also by Stephen Kind. I enjoyed ""The Library Policeman"" a great deal and woudl read it again."
3,I'm a policeman...,"This audio version of Three past midnight will capture your attention especially if you listen to it in the dark. the reader does an excellent job giving each character a distinct voice. spooky music punctuates the suspense of the book giving it a chilling feeling which pulls the lisener in. Still, like most Sk books the begining was better then the ending. I found the way the hero fought off the entity a bit over the top and really didn't make that much sensse. Yes Sam faced his fear but King built up the evil being so much that one would think it took more then childhood fears to kill it off. Overall though a pretty good listen. This book contains 6 cassettes and is narrated by a single reader."
2,Great music bad mp3,"I think this music is wonderful and my rating actually goes towards the mp3 aspect of this music. If I had to rate the music i would give it a 4 maybe 5 star rating. The Mp3 quality, however, is really bad. I had this cd once long ago and loved it, I saw it was for download on amazon and thought, why not? Well all the songs skip pretty bad and I wouldn't recommend downloading this as an Mp3, I would just go ahead and spend the extra few dollars and buy the cd."
4,Stacey Q: The Queen of Retro Dance needs to make a return!,"Stacey Q may not have a breath taking voice but she can sing and carry a note. Her music was unique and very warm as far as I'm concerned. Such songs like Two of hearts are a #1 hit, she reminds me of Madonna in the songs ""Insecurity"" and ""Dancing Nowhere"" she represented what the 1980's synth pop music was all about. Stacey I wish that u would make another REAL POP album, and show what these pop [hopeful]stars like Justin Timberlake, Pink,and Usher, what POP MUSIC is really about instead of adding the old played out ugly new sounds of R&B music to it. It sounds real ugly. It reminds me of hand clapping when the drums are suppose to hit instead. ... Stacey has a good voice, but she uses vibrato TOO much in her singing. Better than heaven is the best album I know off back in 1986. God Bless Stacey Q and please make another album before you decide to settle down. I love you and I wish you the best."
3,Listened to in the context of when it was released--it's OK,"Let's get the obvious out of the way:* NO, Stacey Q isn't a knockout * NO, Stacey Q doens't have a fabulous voice, but it's decent.Now, to reviewing the rest of the album in its original context...In its day, this album had four major hits--not one, but FOUR! At least here in San Diego, a radio station by the name of Q-106 (which no longer exists now that everything shuffled around on San Diego FM) used to play the following songs quite frequently:* Two of Hearts * Music Out of Bounds * Insecurity * We ConnectSo the album, while certainly not a hard-pounding sound with breakneck tempo songs, is good solid light dance music or decent music to play during activities such as reading, studying, or browsing the web at 1:00am.The problem with a lot of the reviews is that they are comparing a sound from many years ago to today's sound and expecting it to sound like today--that just won't happen."
1,Non functioning upon arrival,Received the unit and it didn't function after changing batteries. Returned and was credited with full refund.
2,Cute but not well put together,"I'm a big fan of Lomography and have two of their cameras. However, this item shipped broken to me--the color gels had shifted, and one of the slots to put/change the gels hadn't even been machined properly. When I called the NYC Lomography store for instructions on how to fix it, the thing fell apart. I have a replacement on its way (this was a gift), but this one really is for diehard hobbyists who don't mind spending money on something made like junk. Now, I've played around with these before and when the flash WORKS, it's lots of fun. However, changing the gels can be a pain and if/when the two ""preset"" gels slip, they are almost impossible to reposition without taking the whole thing apart (as I had been instructed to do) which results in lots of small, fragile parts spilling all over the place."
2,"cool concept, terrible quality","This flash is wonderful in concept. However, mine makes a terrible high-pitched squeaking noise when the power is turned on. The build seems cheap: lightweight plastic and crummy electronics. Half the time it fails to fire, which is a huge PITA when you're shooting film."
2,"Fun, but breaks easily and doesnt work with Holga 135","This is a fun flash but as some other reviews say, the color filters easily get jammed so the product seems to be break easily. Also, this DOES NOT work with the Holga 135. When put in the hotshoe, the film winder thing (?) gets in the way and the flash doesnt work automatically. i'm not doing a very good job describing...but trust me on this one. i was disappointed since i got this for my holga"
4,"fun, but delicate","I bought this flash as a replacement for one that broke a year ago. The color gel changing mechanism is very delicate and can get jammed easily.Also it would be better if you had the option to change more that 2 of the filters to colors of your choice, you're pretty much stuck with yellow and blue as half of your color choices.That being said, this is a very fun flash to mess around with. Great for creating trippy multiple exposure effects.Goes great with any camera with an adjustable shutter speed, not just those with hotshoes.I reccomend this flash to any photographer, just be careful whith the color filter changing, and adjust the color wheel gently."
5,excellent,"excelente producto, ideal para fiestas, improvisación en fotografía, iluminación desde puntos realmente extraños, recomendable. plug and play, facil de usar, instrucciónes en español.excelent product, ideal for party shots, photo improve, lightening from different angles. 100% plug and play, easy to use, fun and simple.thanks lomo"
2,Didn't work for my Holga 135,"I bought this specifically for my Holga 135 but because of the low-profile of the flash, it doesn't fit on the Holga 135 - the winder on the camer is too tall. My other Holga has in integrated flash, and my Diana comes with a flash, therefore I am not able to use this at all. I wish I knew about this problem before I bought it. This is the second Holga-related mis-match I've bought. Kind of a drag."
4,Fun flash,This is a nice flash for messing around with. It only uses one AA battery and charges pretty fast. Fits standard hot shoe.
1,Worst filmed so called documentry of a tragic existence.,"Anyone who can sit through this extremely poorly produced documentry must be on heroin themselves. Much of it is in lousy quality video and extremely poor audio. Some of the subtitling is displayed so fast that I had to put my VCR into slow-mo to read it. I thought it would be an engaging story of an addicted pop star but I found it hard to follow and uncompelling. Just because she did drugs and made it with every rock star and producer she met doesn't make her talented. She was beautiful once, yes, but later turned to heroin and became quite decrepit. Her music was mostly uninteresting to me. Some things about Lou Reed and Jim Morrison were interesting but overall the documentry was poorly produced. I guess you'll love it or hate it. I'm donating my copy to the local library where you can loan it for free. It's not worth much more."
1,Don&#65533;t waste your time.,"Came to this film, with a few good recommendations, but no knowledge at all about the woman, Christa Paffgen (NICO) about whom this documentary is based.NICO, a young German woman, model, created an image in conjunction with Andy Warhol and his group as an asexual junkie. As a biography, the film is weak, short on information, with a limited and jaded perspective.As a tribute, it fails miserably. I'm still uncertain where ICON fits in the whole picture aside from looking good in the title. There is little substance in the film to suggest she `earned' any sort of recognition, stature, or approval from anyone but miscreants and lost souls. From my vantagepoint her life seems little different than many misguided college youth who gave up their lives to confusion and drugs, far too early. It's a tragic tale, I guess, but far from distinctive.The whole deal is some sort of inside joke and I sit outside, unfortunately--maybe it all got lost in the translation."
1,Don't fall for this!,"This book is based on faulty research, with a small sample size and ancedotal stories of people the author grew up with in the 50's and 60's. The issues these boys had in a small private school do not relate well to current gifted boys. As a teacher with a MS in Gifted Education I'm amazed that this book is so highly touted. Misinformation, as contained in this book, is more harmful than no information. Read something else."
4,A trip around South Africa...,"Having traveled to South Africa twice, eaten marvelous food while there and wanting to share that food with my family back home, I was looking for a cookbook that was constructed with metric conversions, with background for the foods and with pictures. This book fit the bill. For each area of South Africa the reader gets some history and culture as well as what foods are rather important to each area. At times I find it's oddly organized as it's partly sections of territory and partly types of food, but I'm adjusting and really liking the book."
1,Awful!,"I got this as a gift when I graduated high school in June 2001. I didn't use it, however, until October 2002 when I got an apartment. From the start, I could tell it was a piece of junk. Almost EVERYTHING except bagels slips through, the crumbs just about start a fire (once, smoke was coming out), and it burns anything and everything to a crisp. Of course, this is providing you can get the side lever to stay down to start the toaster. I was overjoyed to toss this piece of junk in the trash the day I moved out! I will never buy Toastmaster brand again."
1,Poor excuse for a toaster,"I purchased this toaster liking the brand name but its not worth the money, bought it 3 weeks ago and now the button doesnt stay down nor does it heat. Thank goodness I did not pay that much for it. Now I know why they had a sale. Its the worst toaster I ever bought, I would not recommend this to anyone. The toasting button doesnt even work right you place it on dark and your toast is light. pay the extra money and buy another brand. For this brand stinks. It worked great for the first maybe 7-8 times we used it then poof it stopped working."
4,Erotic Vampire Romance At Its Best,This is an erotic vampire romance at its best. I loved this book because it featured an unconventional character who's an older woman with some meat on her bones and a hot Hero who was world weary and found beauty in the heroine after so many years of being jaded.
3,Sexy but slightly disappointing,"I enjoyed the sexy scenes and that's the main reason why I bought Fetish. In that sense it was a great book. The story was predictable and the characters lacked depth. I would like to have known more about Aerin and Violanti. However, I could relate to Aerin's insecurity about her appearance and the struggles she faced. The resistance she had to believing that she as attractive to Violanti was very believable. It would be very difficult to overcome 47 years of insecurity about her appearance in a youth and beauty obsessed society.It's a sexy book but the end disappointed me. I may be asking for too much out of an erotic romance. It was more erotic than romantic and I recommend it to anyone looking for a sexy story with a relatable character."
5,Cold Shower Recommended,"I tell you, Sherri L. King did a great job with this one. She was able to combine Romantica AND Fantasy and still keep everything right on track. I have read a lot of the Ellora's Cave books and this was my first read by Sherri L. King. I'm very impressed. This is a great read not only for the sex scenes, but because the author did a great job in writing and telling the story. I recommend this one for those of you who would like to read how Romantica novels should be written!"
3,True to life horror story,"To be frank I almost wish I hadn't seen this movie. Thankfully, time has softened the horror that it depicted. Essentially, a man becomes a quadriplegic due to an accident and tells his wife to ""find a lover"". Being good hearted but extremely foolish/stupid, she starts to have sex with men she despises in order to please her husband. It all goes downhill from there. She gains a reputation as the village whore and at one point is stoned by a group of schoolkids. I think this movie might have been trying to extoll the virtues of ""self-sacrifice"" -- she sacrified her body for her husband. Late in the movie, a pastor describes her as being ""good"". I would describe her as being well-intentioned but ""stupid"". What makes all this so horrific to watch is that it's very believable. It could have happened and probably did. Maybe it was a cautionary tale of what can happen to well intentioned but stupid people ?"
3,Wasn't expecting all this emotion,"Wow, I really wasn't expecting this movie to be what it was. It was a long, winding road to emotional upheaval. I was hoping for some joyous moments to occur but alas, none did. Though, Emily Watson's performance was mesmorizing. I found myself wanting to turn it off but was rather surprised by how it caught me emotionally. I'm not one to shed a tear during a movie but this one got me. If you plan on viewing this movie, know going into it that it is 2 1/2 hours of austere visuals."
2,Be careful what you wish for...,"Wonderful performances from all. Emily Lloyd is a revelation. That said, the picture is 90 minutes of bravura film making. Unfortunately the movie is two and one half hours long. The final hour is shockingly bad. Poorly written and wildly implausable the last 60 minutes of this effort fail miserably. Still the first two thirds is quite good. The chapter breaks are wonderful. An interesting failure."
1,A stupid movie,"This is a ridiculous movie. Unless Bess's IQ is less than 50, otherwise in the real world who will follow the evil and dying husband to do such stupid thing. There is nothing in the movie worth to watch.Besides 'STUPID', I couldn't findmore appropriate word to describe it. STUPID!!!!!!!!"
1,Need to know,Actually I haven't seen this movie but would like to watch it first and then make a rating for this.
2,Eh,"Eh I couldnt even get past the first half of the film. Too much sex for me. Im sure it got better though, I mean almost everyone who reviewed it loved it. But for me I couldnt get into it. Not as good as Dancer in the Dark, which had me in sobs..."
1,Breaking the Bladder,"First off, this film is about an hour too long. It also could not make up its mind as to whether it wanted to be a long dull romance like ""The English Patient,"" or something softcore they show on Cinemax. I found Watson's character so annoying, I breathed a sigh of relief when she was not onscreen, which was not often. Von Trier's documentary approach is not interesting, just stomach churning...and you thought ""The Blair Witch Project"" was jumpy?"
4,god blesses all you sinners,"Yes all devout Christians beware this film it may well shatter your illusions, throw another book on the pyre. The all-loving infallible god who slew the first born and condemned achievement of his beloved children at the tower of Babel. Oh merciful heaven, condone another three centuries of tyrannical witch trials. God loves you as he keeps you. Considering the intimacy of your relationship tell him i said Hi when you next converse.P.s. oh and err.... don't eat from that tree"
2,Uh...,"I personally hated this movie. I just can't stand feeling claustrophobic. If I had seen this director, I would have said ""BACK UP"". It's ruined by this in my opinion.I wouldn't suggest buying it, to me, a waste of money. Maybe you'll like it, but for me it wouldn't be a solid guarantee."
1,More Unberable Than 'Dancer',"'Breaking the Waves' is even more unberable than 'Dancer in the Dark'. Once again Lars Van Trier feels he must shake the camera ALL THE TIME!! Why does this man insist on making the audience dizzy? In this film two people wed against the objection of some authority figures. The characters talk in soft voices and it is very difficult to follow what is going on, even though the story is very simple. The girl's lover breaks his neck during work. He tells her to carry out his sick fantasies. There you have it folk, that's basically the story. At least in 'Dancer' they had singing, but if you want to waste 2 1/2 hours of your life feeling dizzy and bored out of your skulls, 'Breaking' is for you."
2,"Wonderful acting, terrible plot","There is no doubt that Emily Watson is a very talented actress, and she deserved her Oscar nomination for her performance in this film. I really liked the ""look"" of this film - realistic, gritty, very beautiful scenery. The breaks inbetween scenes are also wonderful to watch.However, the story blows chunks, which disappointed me. It's possible to deconstruct anything presented as ""art"" as being somehow ""deep"" and meaningful.But give me a break. This is film school angst rearing its immature head. I hope that we see the talented people who created this movie grow into a willingness to explore human nature instead of being stuck in pointless 'Sturm & Drang'."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen.,"If you like 'Breaking the Waves' you'll probably like 'Naked,' the two worst movies I've ever seen in my life. As far as I'm concerned the movie is based on a crude cliche - 'a f*$king miracle.' About a husband and wife, when the husband becomes ill his wife, a half-wit, follows up on a suggestion by her husband to find a lover and allows herself to be raped and murdered by two men thinking by doing this she will miraculously save her husbands life and miracle of miracles as she dies the husband is brought back to health. If you watch the movie you'll know what I mean about the cliche. It isn't worth the time, money, or effort from any perspective. It's just plain vile, assinine and boring."
2,"Amazing performance, pity about the script","There is no question that Emily Watson gives an amazing performance in ""Breaking the Waves."" Unfortunatly, it is this performance that led many to overlook the fact that the script is unbearably pretentious, remarkably inplausible, and tremendously self indulgent. 2 and a half hours mof watching a woman bed hop and humilate herslef until the inevitiable and very predictable conclusion. Full of art house cliches, ""Breaking the Waves"" can be appreciated only for bringing Emily Watson to the world's attention."
1,I'm not a prude...,"...but I found this film to be nothing more than a pseudo-arthouse exercise in the seemingly ever-popular male preoccupation with depictions of the degradation of women. 'Breaking the Waves' is a near-textbook example of what's meant by the term 'cultural/intellectual pornography', and I don't intend that for a compliment. Von Trier's work has always gotten a relatively cool reception from me, I have to admit--but I found this film to be actually and actively repellent."
2,extremely mixed emotions,"I have never had such mixed feelings about a film. I think the film in and of itself is one of the worst I've ever seen: Lars ""von"" Trier is in my opinion a very sick individual, and the whole ""Dogma"" movement is an extraordinary exercise in silliness. I felt dazed and down for days after seeing this film, due to its twisted psychology, and the ending (with the bells ringing in the sky) is one of the corniest ever - pure kitsch. On the other hand, Emily Watson's performance in the leading role is possibly the best I've ever seen on film (up there with Brando as Vito Corleone, Anthony Quinn as Zorba, and Meryl Streep in ... well, just about any of her roles). For that alone it's worth seeing."
5,Defective pressing?,"My DVD of ""Breaking the Waves"", purchased at the time of release from Amazon went bad approx 3 years after I bought it. Anyone else experience this? I'd like to know before spending a fortune on a defective disc."
5,gravity and grace,200 adjectives. put them in a review. cry your eyes out. buy a camera. looks easy don't it? don't believe it.
1,Unbearably DREADFUL!!!!,"This movie is FOR SADISTS ONLY. From the beginning, you know that the central character is hopelessly doomed, and you spend almost 3 hours just watching her fall apart. It's so obvious throughout that she doesn't have an ice cube's chance in hell, and the film ponderously proves you right. I could not muster any sympathy at all for such a helpless, hapless, and totally idiotic character. The film is like one continuous, monochromatic downhill slide, with a puzzlingly ""upbeat"" (by comparison) or ""inspiring"" ending which is hilariously inane. Can be summed up thus: an idiotically naive, half-retarded woman falls blindly religiously in love with an undeserving lout and basically martyrs herself for him. Really difficult to watch...plus very pretentiously ""artsy,"" self-indulgent and snail-paced."
1,Assign to pretentious drivel.,"Yawn, yawn, yawn. Yet another film a-plenty with pretendy-Highlanders portrayed as drunken, sex-starved, violent, religious maniacs who need to be taught by liberal trendies and outsiders what humanity is. The author's artschool-level interpretation of biblical themes is risible.Myself, coming from the islands, a place where neighbours take an interest and care for each other's well-being, where both Presbyterian ministers and Catholic priests do the rounds of the house-bound and dying, this film is an enormous insult to the values that they hold. Can anybody believe that a minister would step over the body of a dying mentally-handicapped young woman to get into his church? If you hold this kind of prejudice, then you'll enjoy this film.What bitter memories or prejudices provoked the author hold to write such a text? Unless you are interested in minority- or Christian-bashing, avoid this at all costs."
2,"Silly, Pointless","I usually stick to just reviewing what I like, but the distance between how some people speak of this film, and the reality of the movie itself, is so great that I feel compelled to chime in.It's incoherent and pointless. It's just a sick Sirk-like (as in Douglas Sirk) melodrama that changes tone somewhere in the middle, as the director apparently likes to do. It's adds up to nothing and it seems rather obvious that this writer/director wouldn't have it any other way - he makes smirking little facsimilies of art products, not actual art products. This is like a bad parody of Fassbinder's take on Sirk's movies.The lead actors are great, and Von Trier is technically just fine as a screenwriter and as a director. But don't be fooled into thinking that he's furthering cinema in some way with movies like this. He's just yanking chains and the only personal expression going on here is him laughing at the audience."
1,A cinematic hoax,"This film is astonishing only in its depths to which it sunk and the amount of sophistry heaped on top to make ""artsy"". The overdone hysterics of the acting (notably Emily Watson's) and cinema verite style mask what essentially is a ridiculously contrived and supremely manipulative bit of exploitation.""Breaking the Waves"" clocks in at 2.5 hours of watching a mentally ill woman get increasingly abused by her church elders (a convenient bit of typical left-wing Euro anti-religiousity), her family and eventually her husband as she goes from one outrageous ordeal to another. Standard misogynistic nihilism that pretends to be a love story. Or about faith. But in reality, it's predictable, overrated trash, and ranks as the worst film I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through."
2,Emily!,"Emily Watson give an astonishing performance in this film. She deservedly earned an Oscar nomination for it, and it justifiably launched her film career. The film itself however is atrocious - 2 and a half hours of little more than glorified artsy softcore.You can still she this amazing actress however in much better movie. ""The Boxer"" and Hillary and Jackie"" (which earned Watson a second Oscar nomination) are now available on video."
5,rare and original reworking of Christian themes,"This is a very unusual reinterpretation of the Christian concept of love and suffering. Filmed in a rough, hand held documentary style- almost like a home movie- this is an intense , beautiully written, beautifully acted story. It can seem difficult to watch at times because it is so emotionally intense. It will appeal to those who have an interest in the boundaries between religion and insanity. I would compare it to ""The Rapture."" With this single film Trier hasbecome ,in my opinion, one of the major filmakers today. ( One might look at Trier's ""The Kingdom"" if you liked Kubrick's ""The Shining "" ."
1,"Boring, boring, and more boring","Easily my most disappointing Trance purchase of the year. I can't fathom the positive reviews here.The music is technically competent but lacks sparkle and melodic interest. It just leaves me flat and wanting to go on to the next track, looking for that citric kick. But the next track is no better. You know the feeling . . ."
1,like techno,"just not this group, I tried but nope..if I could listen before I bought it I would not have..."
3,Nice music but the least of the 3 Nightmusic compilations.,I liked this album but it simply didn't impress me as much as Nightmusic 2 and 3. There were sections of those that were just magical but I didn't find anything like that here.
1,Below average coffee maker,This coffee maker is cheap and makes poor below average tasting coffee. Mine does not leak. The main problem is that it does not get hot enough. I like my coffee hot and the coffee I get in the pot is what I would call very warm but not hot. The search for a decent drip coffee maker continues.
2,Toastmaster Sucks!,"I bought my Toastmaster Coffee Maker at my local grocery store because it was on sale. I'm a bear without my coffee, so I needed something to make coffee with. This one sucks. Sure, it makes coffee. But the carafe leaks when you pour. There's no measurements on the pot itself, only on the machine. The spout thingie on the filter basket gets clogged easily, and getting the pot in and out is a pain in the butt. And the stupid machine quit on me after a year and a half. If this is all you can afford, you're better off buying instant coffee."
1,Total piece of garbarge,"Yes, it was cheap----but ,oh, the pain it has caused. As another reviewer said, it often just puts the water in the coffee filter and overflows. It doesn't really get hot enough. And, if it is like mine, it won't last you two months and will leave you some morning , caffeine deprived and seeking vengeance against toastmaster."
2,No Frills & No Satisfaction,"This is a basic coffee maker. Unfortunately, you really must use the mesh filter that comes with the appliance. Using paper cone filters for more than 4 cups of coffee will lead to clogging in the water drip container and cause the water to overflow and make a mess. If cheap is what you want in a coffee maker then, this is it. You definitely get what you pay for with this product."
3,Good to Start Out,"I'm in the process of getting things for my first apartment and I bought this. You do get what you pay for. If you are just starting out, whether it be your first apartment or going off to college, this would be a good item. If you are looking for something for that first home or replacing a coffee pot that finally gave out, shop around and pay a little more."
2,I found my old textbook....,This is a dull book. It is probably very important for use by anthropology and archaeology students and is really filled with all of the technical details of the discoveries of these Mayan sites but this is not a book for the layman nor is it a book for the traveler.... it is also not a book for the coffee table or something you can curl up with to learn more about Mayan life.
2,Not a book but a collection of academic research,What can I say...I keep on looking for engaging books on Mayas and this is just not happening. There is a LOT of info in this book but it is poorly written sadly. It is just a collection of academic data with no writing plan and no desire to grab the reader's interest. Very disappointing. I will keep on looking...
3,Can't see the Forest for the trees.,Reads too much like a history book for me.I thought it would be more like a story.
3,A summary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor.,"This is a nice little picture book with an accompanying summary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Plenty of pictures and illustrations of the battle itself show the history of this great attack. The author describes both the Japanese and American point of views prior to the attack. Then a general description of the battle itself and the resulting outcome. There is not many personal stories in this book, just the basics of the attack itself. Lots of information in this thin book.This is an average read. I like a book full of personal stories along with the history to become interested in the book. This is an analtical perspective of the attack and is more focused toward the military historian. A good perspective of the battle."
2,Dead Battery,"The watch arrived just as pictured, but with a dead battery --- as if it sat on the shelf for years. After negotiating the telephone network at Amazon,it was Amazon, not this watch vendor, that credited me back for the battery."
4,Satisfying mystery,"Another good mystery from Charles Todd - the unnamed character in this story is the heavy atmosphere of the North of England, from the storm that impeded Ian Rutledge's entry into the Urskwater valley to the overhanging crags covered with sheep that reminded him of his claustrophobia. I keep wishing that poor Ian would find a woman and I think he almost did until she got shot. She survived however and may appear in a future novel. Hamish is even more present than ever and I am beginning to despair that Rutledge will ever be ""normal."" This is still an excellent series. Can't wait to see where Rutledge goes next."
4,Good episode from a very good series,"A lot of strengths here -- credible and original storyline, fine characters and a well-tuned sense of period (1919). Inspector Ian Rutledge, one of the walking wounded of WWI, is in the northern Lake Country of England to solve the vicious murders of a family of five. The action takes place in the middle of a winter storm and its aftermath that intensifies the impact of the well-written and chilling plot. There are plenty of suspects and a nice twist at the ending.Overall, a fine read by a talented author(s)."
4,First read of this author,"I enjoyed this book, it was my first read of this author and will get some more of his books.This is the kind of book you can read over a long week end. Or you can put it down, but it will still be on your mind so that you must get back to it very soon."
5,Great Mystery by Todd,This is a great mystery with Inspector Ian Rutledge and WWI vet who suffers from war trauma that includes a dead soldier's memory and presence that haunts him. Rutledge is sent to the North of England to investigate the murder of a family in a small sheep farm village. Plenty of characters make solving the murders a challenge for Rutledge and for readers. The author has a keen ability to create suspense combined with character development and the adeptly setting the scene and setting for the plot.
1,I Will Never Buy This Again: Junk,"My Brita SpaceSaver Pitcher is a daily hassle. I drink and otherwise use a lot of water, and was pleased with a different Brita pitcher that I broke. The SpaceSaver does in fact save space, but after that, it is nothing but trouble.It leaks.The entire top falls off, and water spills.Water flows into the handle.The flap falls off.The inside area where I first pour water is quick to grow mold.In short, even though mine still works, I will be replacing it and throwing this onw out. I would not even give my current one away. It will be used by the recycling plant. Maybe they can turn the plastic into grocery bags.Shame on Brita for selling faulty kitchen equipment.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"
1,Leaves a lot to be desired....,"I will echo again what others have said:1. The lid will not stay on this thing.2. Many times when attempting to pour from the pitcher, the hinged lid on the spout is stuck shut and water spills out the sides and around the lid all over the floor.3. If you happen run too much water into the top reservoir when filling, water spills over into the hollow plastic handle on the pitcher. It will then slowly drip out (all over your fridge or on your floor) until it all finally runs out.Frustration!!! The filter and pitcher are expensive enough that this should be a better product for the $$. Will definitely look for something with a better design when I've used up the filters on this one."
1,Aviod this model,"I had the regular Brita pitcher for years and loved it. We've just moved and our kitchen is pretty small, so we thought we'd get the space saver... BAD IDEA. a) the lid falls off when you pour the water -- or when you pick it up, or when you fill it... the lid just doesn't stay on, b) it leaks, and c) although I soaked the filter, I still get little pieces of charcoal in the water. Argh. I wish I had my receipt and the original packaging so I could return this, but because I've used the brand for years, I assumed I could trust the quality."
1,Bad pitcher design matched by bad customer service,"I want to echo the poor reviews of the Brita Space Saver Pitcher. Disappointingly, for a company in the business of making devices designed to hold and pour water, Brita has designed a pitcher which can do neither without making a mess. Water leaks from the resevoir down the handle, the lid doesn't stay on when carrying or pouring, and the spout inevitably drips when pouring. And, when I contacted Brita to let them know I was unhappy with the design, they replied with a form letter that doesn't address any of the issues I raised. My previous Brita pitcher had none of these problems. Given the lack of interest by Brita, I think it's time to move my business to a company that can design a product that works and cares about feedback from its customers."
1,Awful,"Like everyone else, the top falls off mine no matter how I try to snap it into place.Just putting it in the fridge knocks it off.And who thought it was a good idea to allow water into the handle when you fill it all when way to the top?I returned mine two days after buying it."
1,Britta should replace these pitchers or refund people's money,I know this is redundant but boy do I wish I had looked at these reviews before buying this pitcher. The lid design defies good sense. There is nothing to hold the lid on. You MUST hold the lid on with your free hand as you pour with the other. In my case.....not sometimes. All the time. Don't buy it. Period.
1,Wish I could return this thing - deserves no stars,"No stars, really this is the worst. I wish I had saw reviews before I bought this item (unfortunately I did not buy from Amazon). The lid won't stay on, if you fill with too much water it runs through the handle and on to you, the floor everywhere. All I can say is that considering that Brita makes Pitchers with a filter they got 50% of this wrong. Not acceptable.Save your money."
1,Piece 'O Crap,"Oh god I wish I could bring this back. Here are the problems: 1-the lid has a hard time fitting properly. I've had MORE spills from this than any other pitcher. 2-When you fill it full, the water leaks into the handle and out the bottom....and ALL over your floor/sink/fridge. You have to leave it in the sink to let it filter a bit. 2-I don't think the change light button works, as now the water tastes like crap and the filter still says ""okay"".SAVE YOUR MONEY! Get a Pur instead, I've had mine for years and it was great! I just recently had to replace it and thought ""oh I'll get a Brita"". It was a dumb move."
1,High levels of Sodium,The ion exchange resin in the filter exchanges the calcium and magnesium ions for sodium ions. Put my blood pressure though the roof. Don't use this type of filter if you are hypertensive or are on a reduced salt intake diet. They sorta forget to mention that in the literature. Plus I had to exchange my first one because the lid wouldn't stay on.
1,Poor Quality - Lid Doesn't Fit,"Brita used to make really great pitchers and I've used them for years. However, this pitcher in particular is poorly made and doesn't function at all. I had to return four of them; I really wanted them to work, but all of them had major problems. The lid does not fit at all and falls off easily. Also, the handle has two parts, and it kept falling apart. This happened on all of the pitchers I bought. There is also a large gap where the lid opens, so if you fill anywhere near to the top, it comes pouring out. This is poorly designed and none of the pitchers I tried functioned properly."
1,"Nice filtered water escapes with ease, terrible design, don't buy, run away!","Ok, so it does filter water. If you keep the resevoir and the filter you can avoid the auto-spilling pitcher design by filtering into a pitcher of your choice. Waste of money...."
1,Who designed the lid on this thing?,"I've always used Brita water filters and have had good luck with their pitchers until this one. Oh, it looked nice, and I assumed it would be the same type of quality as the others I've owned......wrong! Nothing like pouring water out of the pitcher and having the lid come off. No matter how hard you try, there is no way to safely secure the lid. We humans are quick at adapting, and in this case adapting means keeping a finger on the lid as you pour. Not the way it should be done. Somebody definitely goofed up with this design. I'm giving it a star because it does do a nice job filtering the water, but because it is so poorly designed, that's all it gets."
1,I HATE this pitcher.,"I have been using this pitcher for 9 months and I HATE it every single day. The lid will not stay on, no matter what I do. If I wasn't so frugal, I would have already thrown it away. Considering the frustration it gives me every day, my sanity may be worth the twenty bucks it would cost me to replace it. I really, really hate it. (The water tastes good, it's just the design of the lid that is so unbelievably frustrating. Saran wrap would be a better option than the lid it came with.)"
2,It just doesn't cut it,"I picked this up from my local supermarket. It took a lot of convincing to get my father to agree to purchase it. Since my entire credibility was on the line with the respect to the success of this purchase, I turned a blind eye towards the fact that the lid was trash. I thought my unit was just faulty. I am a bit relieved that it's the pitcher that sucks and not me. Now that the filter needs replacing, I am going to look for a whole new pitcher that does work.The water filtration was great, the packaging was just awful."
1,ridiculous,"I had to tape the top on. It will not stay on by itself. Also, the handle fills up with water and leaks out all over. Good times...Brita should take all of these pitchers back. They have some nerve putting them on the market."
1,What in the world were they thinking with this lid!!!?!?!?!?!?!?,"This is an abysmal product. The lid simply WILL NOT stay on. Thus when one pours himself a refreshing glass of H20, it mixes with the unfiltered water, slops, spills and frustrates."
1,Tape the lid on,"The jug does a fine job of filtering your drinking water. It's easy to fill and fits well in the fridge. The lid, however, is a terrible design. It is warped. I returned the first one I bought, thinking it was just a bad one, but the next one had the same issue. The lid falls off if you look at it wrong. It's hard enough for an adult to use, let alone a child. Luckily, two small pieces of tape cured the lid problem. The spout is also a poor design. If you are trying to pour carefully or just pour a little bit of water you're out of luck. You'll get nothing until the flap lets loose with an initial gush. It works better with the flap removed.I'm no engineer, but I'm pretty sure I could design something as simple as a water jug with a lid that doesn't fall off. Were the QC staff on holidays when this jug was approved for production? Come on Brita, smarten up!"
1,bad design,"i agree with the other reviewers, esp. gribbly snard- lid pops off when i'm filling it + all the water inside spills out. also, water spills into handle, which then leaks onto the counter. terrible pitcher."
1,worst...design...EVER,"AAAARRGGGGG! STUPID LID!!! This is ridiculous, I bet if I bought a pitcher from the dollar store, the lid would stay on. Not cool, Brita, not cool."
1,terrible product,"Got this for Christmas '10 and just as other reviewers have stated, the lid doesn't stay on at all. The first time I tried to pour I thought it was ""user error"" so tried again. And then again - this time over the sink. And every single time the lid fell right off at any attempt to pour - and I was filling it less than half full! I can't even imagine the mess a full pitcher made for the poor souls that made the seemingly logical assumption that a pitcher, any pitcher, would have a secure fitting top.Just as bad, along with the top falling off, the whole filtration insert begins to slide out too, so if by some chance you started pouring and thought ""oh, caught it!"", just wait one more second and the whole insert will fall out and you'll have your giant mess again.I honestly thought I must have a defective one and so I came on here to check reviews and see if others had the same 'defect'. Now that I know it's just plain old shoddy design, I will be returning it and NOT getting another."
1,poor and cheap design on space saver pitcher,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IV0N/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis pitcher is poorly designed, from the top to the pitcher itself. The top is flimsy and doesn't stay on if you bump it in the slightest way, even if you thought you have it set in place. The water sloshes out when you fill it and try to place it back in the fridge or wherever. Worse, when pouring the water the top tends to fall off, and break apart too, so now we have to hold it on there while pouring.The pitcher feels like it would crack if you dropped it or knocked it against the faucet, with sharp edges around the top.We had the same type of brita pitcher before getting this one, I paid the same for it a couple of years ago but the whole thing was much sturdier. The top was much more substantial.Buy a better model even if it costs more, I wish I did!"
1,Brita has lost the plot,"I dropped my old Brita, which was great, and bought this one at the market. What a crock. When you fill it, water leaks through the handle. And then, every time you try to pour or move it, the lid falls off. I am reminded a dozen times a day what a piece of junk this is. Super irritating. What could have happened to the design department of a company for it to go from great to disaster so quickly? And that no one caught it in testing? Weird. Avoid their products at all costs."
1,Terrible Lid Design,"The lid doesn't snap on securely. It fits well, but with no provisions to keep it from coming off when you go to pour a glass of water. Come on Brita! It's not rocket science! This junk is going back to the store."
1,"Good water, bad bad pitcher","Length:: 0:52 MinsThis might be piling on, but we have an obligation to the community: this pitcher is junk. The lid will not stay on. Never mind trying to pour with it, just carrying it to the refrigerator without the lid falling off is a challenge. It should go without saying that Brita should be able to filter water. That's what the company does. The water is great. It will save us a bunch of money. It's the right thing to do for the environment. But come on, Brita. You're based in Oakland, CA. Get some of those smart people from Cal or Stanford to work on your design or QA or something. Manufacturing somewhere that you lost track of?Made a video to show what I mean."
2,Great filtering- TERRIBLE pitcher,"Well, the water's terrific -- but no matter how many times we try to asemble, reassemble and figure out the architecture of the pitcher, the thing leaks when you pour -- and leaks a lot. So it's essentially useless. I wonder what rocket scientist designed such a device. Maybe they can get a job at NASA."
1,Hate the spout!,"This Brita pitcher leaves much to be desired. I never write these reviews, but just had to for this one. Yes, the filtration system leaves the water tasting great, BUT....1. It leaks a little.2. There is often a little bit of charcoal residue in the bottom of the pitcher AFTER soaking for 15 minutes and rinsing any visible residue off and fitting into the space very securely.3. I hate the spout.!!! About a quarter of the time I go to pour myself a glass of water, the spout stays shut and water goes all over the counter or floor in front of the fridge, or wherever I am pouring water into something.I wont' be buying this brand again."
4,Decent quality product...,"All right, so the pitcher that the filter comes with, is literally a $1 store special--very very cheap plastic prone to leaking, BUT, the filter seems to work great and will make your water drinkable. One caveat, when your filter starts to get full, and you pour water, it'll likely leak a bit, which is super annoying (goes back to the cheap pitcher). So you can avoid this by not filling it to the brim.Another reviewer mentioned bits of charcoal in the water, I have not had this problem at all. This could be because he did not soak his filter for 15 minutes in water before first time use. Or it could be because he got a bad filter.The things has saved me a ton of money on bottled water, so I'd recommend it for anyone in NYC who doesn't trust the sometimes brown flowing water. But if you're used to your tap water, you might just want to save the money and the hassle."
1,For better or worse?,"Doesn't anyone else get charcoal residue in the bottom of their pitcher? I do and so does our neighbor. I've even made sure to run water thru a new filter more than the recommended number of times. There is still a fine accumulation of charcoal powder in the bottom of the pitcher. You can write your name in it. The company admits to it, but there are even floating chunks of charcoal in the top chamber. Can't they design it so this doesn't happen. Make you wonder if it's better to drink the water straight from the tap!"
2,My guilt complex gives it 2 stars.,"It holds water and fits in my fridge. Those are the positives.Negatives--IT LEAKS. It leaks when you fill it, it leaks when you walk to the fridge with it. It leaks when you pourrr. A lot. Even if you are really, really careful. This leaves a small puddle on the floor that you will later A. step in, or B. catch your baby splashing in. Nobody likes stepping in cold water with socks on.The lid just pops off, willy nilly. It doesn't 'click' on in any way...it just sits on top. Relatively ineffective. Not *totally* ineffective...it would keep flies out, but only if they didn't bump it, or look at it funny. Otherwise, just carrying the pitcher can cause water to slosh out past the lid.I've recently discovered the black silt at the bottom. That'd be another negative.I think we're just going to buy a new fridge with a built-in water filter. So thanks, Brita...you sucked so bad you convinced my cheapo husband to buy me a new fridge. :D"
1,cover falls off WTF!,"I curse it almost daily who needs the trouble of the cover falling off every pour, brita should seriously remove it from shelves and fix the design, I will not purchase another brita filter because of the poor engineering of a simple product.Otherwise, the water tastes good. It filters well but it irritates me more than it is worth. I never write reviews, good or bad, but I just came from the fridge to do so."
1,Worst product design ever,"There was obviously NO product testing done on this before manufacturing. It's worthless. The lid does NOT stay on and it dribbles water ALL over.It DOES earn the one star ONLY because it has a Brita filter in it. Too bad that filter is surrounded by the crap which the 42364 SpaceSaver Pitcher is.Get the ""Brita 42629 Slim Pitcher"" instead. It's a little smaller but works GREAT!"
1,The lid keeps falling off!,DO NOT BUY this pitcher. The design is not right. Add some more $$ to it and getBrita 35530 Ultramax Dispenser. You don't have to refill 1000 times and it dispenses water until your party is over!
1,Utter Garbage,"I picked one of these up expecting the same quality I've experienced with past Brita pitchers. I was immediately frustrated by how poorly the lid was designed. It refuses to stay on no matter how hard you try to fit it correctly. Water constantly leaks after filling the pitcher. All around absolutely miserable product, and I just wish I kept the box so I could return this thing. If I didn't have 10 more new filters, I'd probably not buy a future Brita product out of principle. However, I do have a lot more filters, so I'll likely buy a better Brita filter, be reminded why I've always liked Brita products, and all will be forgiven."
1,Brita Filter Pitcher Review,"I'm a nice person and don't complain much, however, I can't believe this water filter pitcher passed inspection. You cannot pour from it with one hand because the lid is just resting on the top- you must hold down the lid with one hand as you pour with the other, and must balance the lid to stay on from the sink to the fridge. When I filled it up and went to put it in my fridge I wondered why it was 'peeing' water all over my floor as I went. Turns out the handle fills with water and comes out the other end. The little filter beads float out of the filter but they never get into the drinking water, so I can deal with that. Conclusion; you can obtain clean good-tasting water from this pitcher- but it is hard work on your end."
1,Lid Falls Off!,"This is my third or fourth Brita pitcher, and they all work fine for filtering water. However, I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this one, as the lid falls off, all the time. Whether I'm putting it back on the side shelf of my refrigerator door or pouring the last of the water from the pitcher, BAM!, there it goes again. I would not recommend this particular model to anyone."
2,Lid is crap!,I had my old Brita pitcher for over 5 years and decided to get a new one. I bought 3 of these 6 cup pitchers and the lid kept falling off every one of them. The plastic is much weaker and the workmanship is horrible compared to my original Brita. The last one I bought tonight has a lid that doesn't even fit on the pitcher. Take this piece of crap off the market and start making the old design with the better materials!
3,"Good filtration, but pitcher could use a few improvements.","Pros:1. Water tastes great!Cons:1. Lid cannot be secured, makes a very poor seal, and, needless to say, frequently falls off when pouring (don't even try to pour the filtered water while there is still unfiltered water in the top: you will make a watery MESS). Thus, it is a two hand operation, which I think is unnecessary.2. If you pour when the pitcher is more than half full, then your filtered water goes upwards through the filter spewing out as it goes the filter's sand-like carbon bits into the top portion of the pitcher. I guess this doesn't hurt anything, but it does seem to me like a careless design for a filter costing roughly $9. Do we really have to see the entrails of the filter? I think not.It seems to me that these filtration pitchers are such a no-brainer concept, so I am baffled as to why the problems I mentioned above even exist.Hope this helps!"
2,Lid = Design Defect,"This is my 3rd Brita Pitcher that I've owned. The filter fits in just like it always has. There are some key differences.BENEFITS--------+ Space Saving Design. The pitcher is tapered unlike the rectangular ones in the past. But it seems to hold less water than the standard Brita pitcher.+ Calendar Dial built into the lid approximately tells you when to change the filter. This is better than the vinyl stickers in the older pitchers.DESIGN FLAW------------ The lip of the lid doesn't sink into the pitcher deep enough. You'll need to use one hand to pour and the other hand to hold the top of the lid down. When you forget to do this, there is a very good chance that the lid will fall off *as you* pour water.Try another Brita pitcher instead. This one is not worth the trouble."
2,Brits space saver pitcher not up to standard,"This pitcher is unbalanced because the designer felt it must fit into a refrigerator door These dimensions makes it unwieldy when full and especially if the top reservoir is full too.The lid does not fit into the reservoir properly and falls out when the pitcher is tilted to pour water. Since there is a problem with fit, the gap between the top and the handle is emphasized. Somehow water seeps into the hollow handle only to drip out slowly. Once in the refrigerator, if unnoticed, there will be water on any objects standing beneath it.Brita water pitchers offer many benefits. It is a shame this one's design shortcomings overshadow its good properties. This model should be returned to the drawing boards"
1,Let's sell something that doesn't work!,"As the other reviews say, the lid does not really attach to the pitcher at all. It just sits loose on top and falls off when you try to pour water. This product is a sham and I definitely will never buy from Brita again.I wonder if they just had some extra lids lying around at the factory that they needed to get rid of? The only other explanation is that this is a massive practical joke on gullible consumers, because it is highly unethical to sell a product that is implied to be functional, and that turns out to be totally useless. I don't care if it's still technically possible to pour the water if you take the top off every time. It's not supposed to be that difficult to pour a glass of water! Brita, maybe times are tough and you can't pay as much for good designs, but this is just awful. You should be ashamed of yourselves."
1,This pitcher makes me hate everything,"As everyone else has said, this pitcher is awful. I've had plenty of Britas, none of which have been problematic, but this thing is awful. I spill water all over the place at least twice a week. Go for another model."
1,Do not buy this product,It is inconceivable to me that a brand name like Brita can't make a pitcher you can pour from without 1/3 of the water you try to pour spilling out from the poorly designed pitcher lid. I thought perhaps I had just received one that was slightly misshaped but now having read the other reviews realize it is a design flaw.This is not a cheap item and while the idea of having an additional filter for your water may be appealing to some I promise you that you will not be satisfied with this faulty product. I happened to buy this at a discount club but came to Amazon after the fact to look at other reviews. I didn't think I needed to `research' Brita in the water filtration business. I strongly recommend that Amazon stops selling this product as it is not something you would want to be associated with.How can you sell a $60+ pitcher in 2011 that you cannot pour from?
1,Piece of junk,"Same problem everyone else seems to have...lid won't stay on. I can get my lid into place very easily, but if I don't pour the water out at a VERY shallow angle, the lid falls right off. Returned this item."
1,Terrible Lid,"I've purchased a few Brita products and have been very happy. Unfortunately, this pitcher is useless. The lid does not snap on or fit in any way on top of the pitcher. It just ""lays"" on top, resulting in the lid coming off when you pour water. The flap at the end on the lid does not even stay snapped on.... Research other Brita products instead of this one..."
1,you will flip your lid,"Cover falls off with the slightest movement. When filling, water flows through the handle and all over the place if the reservoir is anywhere near full. Replaced this with a PUR, which I believe does a better job of filtering my well water, but has a more expensive cartridge which clogs after very little use. Had an old Brita for years which was fine although I never felt good that some charcoal from the filter always managed to get into the water in the reservoir. I would not purchase another Brita after the experience with this product."
1,Terrible!,I wish I read the reviews on this before purchasing. The top does not lock or stay on securely. Every time you pour it leaks.
2,"Compact, but poorly designed","If you fill the water reservoir to full, it spills down the handle. Also, the lid doesn't stay on so a rubberband is currently holding it on. Looks tacky, but the only fix I could think of."
3,water filter,Considering the reputation that Brita Products have I wasn't thrilled. I wanted to have water available without using bottled water... (thinking about going green).This worked well but the lid of the container keeps failing off when in use.Would think twice about buying it again. Size is frig friendly.
3,Basic water filter,It remains to be seen as to the quality of the filtered water. The pitcher top could be made more secure since it easily pops off.
2,Brita pitcher,"The item is a fair product. However, this vendor had taken the filter andthat was not mentioned in the description. Also,the top falls off everytime I pour."
1,Terrible design,"The lid comes off all the time, so you have to hold the lid on while you pour. The water leaks into the handle. Very poor design. I expect better from Brita. I'll be getting a different pitcher to replace it."
1,Poor Design,"I haven't had trouble with the lid falling off or the protective flap staying down when I try to pour, but the darned thing leaks--through the handle! I like the size, I like the reviews the filter itself gets, but using it without dripping water all over the place is a challenge."
1,Can't TASTE the water when it spills every time,"Again, how can Britta put out such a shoddy product? I should have stuck w/my 15-year-old NON space-saving pitcher: at least the lid stayed on when poured and that supposedly clean eater didn't spill all over us. Piece o' junk."
2,Bad design.,"I bought this to replace an old Brita pitcher I'd bought sometime in the late nineties, when the old pitcher cracked. I still had a bunch of filters, so I bought another Brita so they wouldn't go to waste. I wish I'd chosen another model.Does this take up less space in the fridge?--sure. Does it filter water?--absolutely. But, the lid falls off ALL the time when I go to pour, and the reservoir is designed so that if you overfill it, or just aren't very careful when filling it, water goes into the handle and drips out over the next few minutes (leaving a puddle in your fridge.) I would recommend choosing a different model than this one."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,This is my 2nd Brita pitcher. First one was great. This one is terrible. The top does't fit well & comes loose every time I use it. This is a terrible product. Do not waste your money on this.
1,Poor Design,"My husband and I happened to see this pitcher while at a home improvement store, and decided that we should switch to filtered water instead of bottled water. I liked the compact design of this particular pitcher and thought it would be great for our somewhat small fridge. I soaked the filter, put the filter in the pitcher, and tried to put the lid on so I could fill the reservoir. The lid does not snap into place. I thought I was doing something wrong so I showed it to my husband who can always fix everything. He inspected it and decided that I was not doing anything wrong. The lid is not made to be secured in place. What a horrible design. I'm not sure what the purpose of the lid is. I wish I had read the reviews before we bought it because now I have to go back to the store to return it. I would not recommend it at all."
2,The New Brita Pitcher Has Literally Flipped Its Lid,"I had a Brita pitcher for many years, and I had no complaint, but it was old, so I decided to get the new one. Who knew I would regret that decision? The lid on this pitcher will not stay on. I kept thinking I was missing something because surely they didn't make a lid that in no way would attach to the pitcher. I was wrong; that is exactly what they did. I am so disappointed in Brita. They have so many great products. How is it that their designers allowed such a poorly made product to be put out for sale? They should be embarrassed.If you purchase this pitcher be prepared to do two things: 1. Put a hand on the lid when you are pouring so the lid doesn't fall off and make a mess 2. take the lid off altogether when you want to refill the pitcher. The little thing that opens on the top flips the entire lid off when you press it, so it is useless."
1,Junk,"While this pitcher does exactly what it's supposed to do, which is filter tap water, everything else about it is just plain bad. The lid will not stay on no matter what - and if you try to pour with the lid on, it will fall off, hit your glass, and slosh water all over you. It doesn't snap on, it just kind of sits on top. For some reason we've kept it for about a year (after throwing the lid in the garbage) and this morning the white top part cracked and a large chunk fell off. I like Brita; the filters are reasonably priced and they make your water taste great, but this particular pitcher is junk."
5,Brita pitcher,"I got the 2-quart model so that it's not so heavy when pouring out the water. Actually, it's two quarts if you also count the amount of water that's in the top part of the pitcher, before it is filtered.In the past I've used the Brita Ultramax with the spigot so that it's easier to dispense water but I found that mold grew too quickly on that (on the spigot). With the 2-quart model sometimes I get a small amount of black mold around the edges of the lid but I wash out the pitcher at least weekly and that helps.I think Brita is great. It's been in our household for years and makes the water taste great."
1,Pathetically poor design.,"(1) Lid will not stay on.(2) Handle fills with water and then slowly leaks.(3) Date thumb wheels hard to move.I was compelled to write this review on first use. I'm sorry that I didn't read all the other bad reviews on Amazon before I bought or opened the package. I couldn't have imagined that someone could screw up something so simple so badly. Dumb assumption on my part. The limited warranty only replaces broken parts, there is no money back guarantee.But will work if you treat it like your Grandmother's china tea pot."
3,Beautiful and Elegant but glow in dark aspect sucks.,"Elegant, no doubt. Everybody has praised this watch on my wrist. Only disappointment is that it only minimally glows in dark esp if it stays in dark for more than a few minutes. Otherwise I like this watch very much."
1,Useless,I have ordered this book for possible trainning of new employees. There is nothing applied in this book. I was looking for help to explain with examples when can be used and related limits of formal project management tools. If you are looking for this type of information just forget it
1,Worst Textbook Ever,"I had to get this book for a project management class. It was the worst-written textbook I have ever read. It repeats itself constantly, with exercises repeating what is (poorly) explained in the body of the chapter. Constant bullet-point lists have multiple points that present (cryptically) the same point. The text is disjointedly written.Kerzner is apparently involved in the PMI testing process, and therefore a name. But this textbook was universally reviled by my fellow students. I can't recommend another book because I haven't looked further, but I _can_ urge you to find another title."
4,"Interesting, but I was hoping for more.","This book was interesting, but I was hoping for more pictures from the 1800s. The muscle men presented had a good selection of body building pioneers and famous names. The pictures of everyday guys strutting themselves, while providing a time capsule of men feeling proud about their bodies, didn't offer anything outstanding in the way of physical development. If you are looking for links in the chain of what would later become beefcake photos and pioneering body builders, you'd like this book. If you are looking for a definitive history with more pictures of Sandow, Atlas, Joe Weider, and Steve Reeves you might be dissapointed."
2,I wish it worked.,"I got this for my daughter and she loves it, when it's working. It gets stuck making this awful repetitive noise and doesn't stop until you turn it off. Even once your turn it back on its hit or miss wether or not it will work the way it should. I agree with the people who had had problems with the slippery feet, it moves all over the place which was a bit frightening when my daughter was first pulling herself up on things and it would slide out from under her! Its too bad they didn't think through a flaw that would be so easily fixed!"
5,winnie the pooh explore & learn,"my granddaughters love this table of fun! There is so much to see, do, learn & listen to!"
3,"Good, but not for beginners.","Although the design is cute and the songs not too annoying, I think there's something to be said about this toy getting a little repetetive. The big problem we had was the fact that the legs were slippery, on carpet, on wood, you name it. It made it hard for our 9 month old to get up at first, and once she was up, it would slide around on her, acting more like a walker than an activity center."
2,Songs get an A--Sound gets an F,great songsREALLY bad soundWhen are these songs going to be re-mastered or better yet--HDCDed?
3,get the originals,"If you really want the full flavor, 100% Aretha Franklin get the original albums - you'll miss so many great songs by getting ONE ""Greatest Hits"" or ""Vol. 1"" - it isn't worth it.Pullin' is a knock out song that I've never heard, Try Matty's and When the Battle is Over are all excellent examples, but, oh, you just want Spirit in the Dark. Too bad, you lose.Elton John's ""Border Song"" is literally turned inside out, for the better, but too bad, you missed it.Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money and treat your stero right, you deserve it - her early work at Atlantic is more than just #1 'hits' it's a body of impressive work by a talented artist. When she accompanies herself on the piano - man, make no mistake - the woman rules."
5,Still the undisputed queen of soul,"I'm not gonna go into details about this which is from the best and vintage years, but the only singers that come anywhere close to hear are Laura Lee, Tommie Young and the late great Linda Jones."
4,Queen of Soul? Absolutely,"This disc does feature the Queen of soul at her finest, that can't be argued. Aretha cuts to the chase right away on this disc. the only reason I gave it four stars is that the reproduction quality is off, almost to the point of spoiling her greatness but, not that much. She's got it, and you know it when you hear these songs. I haven't heard anything this good old school Since ""Maxine Lewis's ""Mindfull lp which is even rarer than Aretha herself. So yes, buy this to her why she is called the Queen of Soul."
5,You must have this!,"I had a copy of this CD for years just to find that on of the 2 CDs was missing from the case. When I tried to replace it for myself, I could only find it on Amazon. Each year I place a classic CD in each of my daughters' Christmas stockings. This year I gave each of them the Definitive Soul Collection. They love it! My granddaughter is 3 years old and she loves to listen to Aretha in her mama's car on the way to school. Her favorite song is Chain, Chain, Chain. You have to get this!"
5,Aretha's best hits,"This is a great classic CD by Aretha Franklin and it has all of the best songs on it. Really fast delivery, and thank you."
5,That Girl Can Sing!,"I think she has a fantastic voice. On the divas night live special on VH1 with all the popular divas such as Mariah Carey, Celene Dion, Shania Twain. They all disappered. She ruled the night with her powerful voice. The CD is great because the songs are classics!"
2,"Great songs, poor sound.","This is an amazing collection of Aretha's artistry, unfortunatly the sound quality is quite awfull. I dont know if the problem was the original sources or the mastering onto CD but most of the songs sound muffled and weak. Aretha's voice is badly equalized, lost under the instruments and the chorus. The sound is fuzzy, not sharp, sort of what you get when you put a piece of cardboard over your speakers. As I said its a great collection, but due to the poor sound I rarely listen to it. This is a disc that merits a remastering procedure."
5,Incredible Overview of Aretha's career,"First of all, I've owned 30 Greatest Hits for a long time and always thought it was an incredible collection. But after Amazon put song samples out for practically all of Aretha's material, I realized that practically everything Aretha recorded from '67 to '74 was great, so I picked up all the available cds. After having listened to all her work from the period, I'm even more impressed with 30 Greatest Hits. The compilers have accomplished the seemingly impossible: boiling down a decade of sustained brilliance to two cds. Contrary to what another reviewer writes, the producers of this collection have chosen superior and more representative non-charting material over the safer charting choices, which was incredibly brave and astute of them. Surely this is one of the best compilations in any genre, ever. For casual fans of Aretha, 30 Greatest Hits is all you'll ever need. For diehard fans, get EVERYTHING from '67 to '74."
2,Avoid this book,"On the plus side, the pronunciation guide at the front of the book is excellent.On the minus side; no tonal marks, many errors in the examples.I have shown this book to several native speakers in China and they said 'we don't say that'. In many of the examples the words appear to have been taken from a dictionary without consideration of use in context. The words are correct but the sentence has no meaning.I removed the pronunciation guide and tossed the book."
2,Not a tool for serious learners,"This book attempts to be a shortcut for people who don't want to learn the pinyin system. This creates some fundamental problems. First, the romanization system it uses is subjective. While the author's choice of letters may seem logical for one accent, it does not make sense for all. Second, while the introduction gives lip service to the importance of tones, the entries fail to denote them in any way. I would not recommend this book to anyone. There are much better alternatives for a casual learner, and it is completely unsuitable for a serious student."
2,With one major flaw..,This could have been a pretty good reference for spoken phrases but ... Where are the tones!?Besides the short introduction -- without the tones -- there is almost no point to it all.I'm really not sure how this was published as is. This book is about the equivalent of an almanac that lists only the months as the date..
3,Not as accessible as I had hoped,"This book has a lot of good content. The last bit of it has some stuff that does not necessarily pertain to every reader (chapter on children). Some ideas presented were self-hyponsis, cognitive distortions & thought logs, and wants vs. needs.I gave it a 3 out of 5, because thought stopping/replacing isn't always helpful, approximately half of the content did not pertain to me, and poorly addressed goals vs. values (values clarification)."
5,Went Above & Beyond My Expectations,"This book had so much substance EXPLAINS a lot!Giving VERY PRACTICAL examples and stories, you almost feel as if the book was written with your ideas and thoughts in mind- You can identify with it instantly, almost thinking ""WOW, I thought i was the only one"". It gives another voice of reason and logic to the negative voice forcing a lot of the self esteem issues.It uncovers many deep issues, being very revealing about self anger, or self loathing-self rejection. It also helps for the small issueslike confidence and interaction between co-workers or family. It doesn't stop with just an explanation- it goes the next step -giving some very great suggestions & methods on healthy recovery. It went above and beyond-covering so much!- the audio book was a delight for me."
5,Great Book,You'll see results from this book if you stick to it. Go through the chapters slowly and take time to follow the suggestions - I've found them quite helpful! This is one of the best self-esteem books I've seen.
4,This is a good self help book,I bought this book hoping to help my sister with some self esteem issues. The book has good suggestions which seem to be very solid and useful. I would recommend it.
3,wrong author,"Kirk Johnson did not write this book. Matthew McKay and Patrick Fanning wrote it. The cover looks nothing like your picture.The book is very basic cognitive therapy applied to the principles of self esteem. If you read it a little at a time, really take the time to think about it and work it, it will work."
1,Self-Esteem not as advertised,"When I started reading this book I had low self-esteem. Then I read all of the book. Afterwards, I still had low self-esteem. So, for me the book wasn't good and I give it a rating of 1 star.Why do I have low self-esteem is a good question. Maybe this book didn't work for me because the advise is too generic and too one-sizes-fits-all as opposed to directly dealing with a lot of the issues, concerns and problems in my life. And, that for better or worse I'm just different then most other people with low self-esteem."
5,very good book about cognitive techniques and who they can help,Great book to get to know cognitive techniques and the personality types that they can help.
4,Good self-help book,"This book is wonderful for explaining how and why people do the things they do, intentionally or accidentally, to hurt others. In addition to analyzing an issue, the author has suggestions and exercises to counteract the problem and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion. Great for anyone who has been or is currently verbally abused."
3,Slow shipping!,"The product is great, although the company that sold it and shipped it sure took their sweet time!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:One of Woody Allen's more minor works, Mighty Aphrodite is pleasant enough and features a winning performance by Mira Sorvino, but doesn't have the staying power or distinctiveness of his better films."
1,ripped off by Mars,"I purchased this dvd on line from amazon and when I received it, I tried to play it and it wouldnt play so I tried to play it in another dvd player and it wouldnt play on that one either. They sent me a dvd to my R.I. home in the USA that will not play in the USA or Canada and they blamed me . they said it was my fault and they will credit the return minus shipping charges. so I lost the money for shipping both ways"
4,Damn what a good film,"There seem to be three camps when it comes to Woody Allen. (1) People who love his earlier works and villify his most recent films (2)People who love all of his films (3) People who hate Woody Allen, his films, and anything else related to him. I belong to the second group, and like most of his films. Mighty Aphrodite is a great movie, featuring the performance that put Mira Sorvino on the map. This film also contains a great performance by Michael Rappaport, who has gone on to do more stellar work with Allen. Every time I watch this movie I laugh. If anything, see this film for the Greek chorus led by F. Murray Abraham. Like most of Allens more recent works this film is funny and wacky, while at the same time you don't leave the movie feeling as if you've lost brain cells by watching it."
5,Mighty Aphrodite by Woody Allen,"I love Woody Allen Film, so this a a great way for me to finish my oollection of his film."
2,Just not very good! (or funny either).,"A couple of good scenes. A couple of laughs. That is about it. Ugh. The cut-backs to the Greek Stage Act scenes were absolutely horribly boring. Woody is always interesting as the nervous, paranoid, type A, personality. He always comes across as needing psychological help. But, the whole movie was below trite and trival. Egads. Watch something else. Take a bath, wash your hair. Trim your fingernails. Surely there is something more to do then to watch this flick. But, there are a few worse movies then this one. Just not very many."
5,Woody Allen comes through for me,"The first fifteen or twenty minutes of this film made the purchase worth it. I was seeking a modern film that would demonstrate the ancient Greek theater method of a chorus and principals, and wound up with this little, mediocre film that Woody Allen put together. A real winner for me, despite the bizarreness of Allen's ""angst in New York"" theme."
1,A bore,"Dull, unoriginal, and utterly unfunny, this movie is to be avoided at all costs. Mira Sorvino is amusing for her first 20 seconds on screen and then becomes annoying and abrasive. Try imagine listening to someone scrape a fork across a chalkboard and you get the idea of how unpleasant this movie is."
1,Damaged/Defective Merchandise,"The disc wouldn't play in our machine (others do, not the player's fault) and it said something about being coded for the wrong area, so we sent it back."
1,Couldn't play it!,"I gave it as a gift, but my friend could not play the dvd. Maybe it's blue ray (which I did not order). Or maybe it's a defective dvd."
5,this movie was extraordinarly amazing,this movie took an advance look at the reality that may come from adoption no matter how great of a child you get it may have come from a toilet. miss sorvina was amzing in how she potrayed the the role of a idiotic hooker.
5,A must for the Ty plush collector!,"We Ty plush collectors have been waiting for this book. This guide contains pictures and information on Ty plush that I had never ever heard of! The pictures are very well done, very clear. It also has information on Attics and Beanies, but it's the plush section that really makes it unique."
1,Bad Toaster,"The breads and english muffins always fall through to the bottom and gets stuck, I have to open the crumb tray at the bottom to get it out. After a year two slots stop working, Do not buy"
2,4 Slot Toaster,"I like the sleek appearance of this toaster, however, the toaster doesn't evenly toast if you use all 4 slots at the same time. Additionally, over time, the toast itself doesn't toast even at the darkest setting."
4,Secrets and Love,"The comparison to LaVyrle Spencer is valid. Secrets and family relationships are the heart of this story.Hannah is living a privileged life. She is wealthy, is adored by her husband and has a wonderful relationship with her teenage daughter. But she also has a big secret. On her 17th birthday, she gave birth to a baby boy. She only held him once before she had to give him up.And now 20 years later, her world is going to come crashing down around her when her son shows up at her door.....The people draw you in and you keep reading hoping for a happy ending.An author to watch for."
1,Not by Sarah Hoyt,"Family AlbumIf you're looking for a book by Sarah Hoyt...this isn't it.Amazon has the author wrong. It's not by Sarah Hoyt, nor is it by Sarah Hoyt using a pen name.Don't be fooled! Only a Sarah Hoyt book will soothe that craving for great reading, interesting characters, and female protagonists who refuse to be victims! Accept no substitutes!"
4,Insight into a different era...,"I read this book on the recommendation of a client and was impressed! Halberstam does an excellent job of weaving the tale of four teammates forever bound by baseball, Boston, and their friendship. Each has his own story and personality from the larger-than-life Ted Williams to the reserved Bobby Doerr all revealed with masterful writing. A must read for any Red Sox or baseball fan. Because of the masterful writing I will be reading more of David Halberstam.October 1964Summer of '49 (P.S.)The Best and the Brightest"
4,An Account of True Friendship and Loyalty,"It is a very rare thing in sports today to see teammates who end up staying together for anymore than a couple of seasons at a time.With free agency and the big business that sports have become most players have very little connection to the town they play in or the people they play with.This book tells of a time when players stayed with their teams for the long haul and loyalty was something that had meaning for athletes.Ted Williams, Johnny Pesky, Bobby Doerr and Dom Dimaggio played the bulk of their careers together for the Boston Red Sox and forged a true and meaningful friendship... this book recounts their lives together playing for this great baseball franchise. It also details the last visit Pesky and Dimaggio made to their dying friend Ted Williams.If you love stories about baseball this book is right up your alley. It gives you a view into the lives of legendary ball players and shows just how human they can be."
2,Disappointed,"I've read many of the author's works, all of which are great beyond description. However I was disappointed in this one. It gave a somewhat brief history of the men involved, how they came together, their commonalities, and their differences. As a lifelong Red Sox fan, I was expecting more."
5,The Teammates,"This is a great book. One of the best books I've read. Dom Dimaggio and Johnny Pesky is driving to Florida to visit the sick Ted Williams for the last time. On the 1,300 mi. trip to Florida, Dimaggio and Pesky look back on all the memories they had on the Red Sox with Ted and Bobby Doerr. Memories from fishing with Williams and Doerr to the field of Fenway Park. Dan Halberstam has once again created a master-piece."
2,A trip to Florida,"The cast of players in this book are from my time(I am 75)and I lived baseball, in the 40's thru 60's and enjoy baseball stories, but this book is weak. The author tends to be redundant and has little new information to impart.."
3,Halberstam is always good.,"This was an interesting, quick read that really brought back the magic of baseball in that era. A good story about baseball & friends."
2,It's a rehash in a different cover,"Halberstam's Summer of '49 already told much of this and at less than 200 pages you can see he's mailing this one in using research he already did. I liked the stuff about the 80 y/o's driving down to see Ted but the rest is plainly found elsewhere and rewritten stuff from his other book. Personally, I don't get Halberstam at all. I find him just a bit too much. For writings about baseball's distant past I much prefer Creamer or Angell (even he is also good on up-to-date stuff) or Kahn."
5,"Friends first, teammates second","Ted Williams, Dom Dimaggio, John Pesky, and Bobby Doerr.Four men born 19 months apart who spent most of their entire baseball careers together. Four friends who have been together and helped each other since their minor league days.""The Teammates"" recounts the history of these four men and the trip that Dimaggio and Pesky took in late 2002 to go see Ted Williams in Florida, shortly before he died.Highly Recommended!"
2,Pretentious bilge at best,Mr. Halberstam continues his decline as a serious journalist. This odious valentine to the 50's Red Sox should come complete with a hanky. Ted Williams & co. deserve better.
1,"The ""Same Olds""","I call Halberstam, Roger Angell, Roger Kahn et al, the 'same olds'--they write the same books over and over--all in their very 'intelligent, high brow, upper eastside of new york, 'style.' BORING, except to those at the ultra-in-the-know, New York Times, where they can never do wrong. Because they're smart--like Al Gore was 'smart'. If you're 'smart', the Times thinks you're better, more informed. But, of course this is not true and that's why we have more boring (I use that word specifically) books by these 'smart' baseball 'minds'. This book says nothing new, has no great feeling...it's halberstam though and it must be good--right? he's so smart! How can you go wrong if the New York Times likes it?"
1,Boring and Typical,Halberstam is maybe the most overrated writer (especially on baseball) of the past 20 years. Don't waste your time reading a re-write of 'summer of '49'--.
5,A book to treasure,This is such a refreshing read after the usual crop of egocentric rants by players who aren't even in the same league as this foursome. A baseball book that is thought-provoking. What a concept! The fact that there are two such books this spring is even more amazing. The Little Red (Sox) Book is as irreverent as The Teammates is reverent. I encourage baseball lovers to read both.
5,Another Classic Journey into Baseball's Past,"The writing style of David Halberstam is at its eloquent best with this wonderful journey into baseball's glorious past; this time, recounting the road trip some buddies made to visit an old pal.Of course, what makes this story so compelling is it involves several members from a very good Boston Red Sox team from over half a century ago, as they journey south to visit the game's greatest hitter during his ""last at bat""; Ted Williams.It's a poignant tale, filled with rich doses of baseball history and sharp commentary from the wonderful author, David Halberstam. I only wish it had gone into more detail; extra innings would've been nice to satisfy this baseball fanatic's appetite.This is another classic piece of work from Halberstam; and a nice ending to the storybook career and life of one the game's most enigmatic players; and the true friendship that bonded him with some guys he used to work with."
4,IT MAKES YOU WONDER. . . ?????,"During and now, after, reading this book of ?? old-time ??players keeping friendships alive for 40-50-60 years, , , ,How many of the current crop of super-stars will be able tosay the same thing????"
4,I need teammates,"This is not a book about baseball. It's a book of life, which just happens to involve ballplayers. It explores relationships between friends, and how those relationships are formed and evolve. It shows how one life can affect so many others over time, and how so many others can affect it. This could have involved any four guys the author wanted, and still worked as well. The fact that they were baseball players was a happy addition.This book was even better the second time I read it. As a fan, I knew many of the stories that were discussed, but they were written in a way that brought them to a whole new light. In the end, it made me wish I could have a relationship like these four teammates had. I can only hope that I will have friends like that when my time comes."
1,Bad Product,"the controls for both ranges don't work, since the very begining they fail to turn it off and it is both controls so i am sure you will get more complains regarding this aspect of the product. It was cheap, but i would rather have paid more for it to get a better product with working controls."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"The product was good when it first came on the market but recent versions of it are AWFUL AND CHEAPLY MADE!My first littermaid that I purchased nearly four years ago broke and had to be replaced by the manufacturer. The replacement lasted for 3 years and then broke. I bought another one and after only one month that broke. They replaced it again and after only 3 days IT BROKE. By broke I mean the rake comes off the track when it tries to pick up a clump and the wheels keep running but the rake doesn't move and you have to force it back on the track just for it to come off again.Even when this item worked, it was only slightly better then a regular box because the rake always got jammed up and gross! Please do not throw away your hard earned money on this product. I beg of you..."
1,Littermaid neads a maid to clean up,"It is very messy and is not useable without the purchase of a tent. With the tent, the thing is HUGE. The mechanism wont work if you go above the fill line with litter. With the tent you cannot see the fill line. The raking creates lots of spills within the tent and it is used litter that gets spilled into places you can't see or reach easily. It is very loud and we have to turn it off at night. The litter and receptacles are very costly to replace. You can't use standard litter. And if your cats have long hair the clumping litter sticks to them. The rake gets clogged easily. Removing the waste is not simple. The receptacle is difficult to lift out and is very flimsy and rips. Got cats? Get a litter box and old fashioned litter and a scoop!"
1,Terrible,"My litter box worked properly... maybe twice.After that, the litter box runs continuously. When it does run, it does a terrible job of cleaning. No matter what kind of litter I use, the clumps get stuck in the rakes, and the unit doesn't have enough HP to push the litter forward.The unit will run forever, even with no litter in it. I'll be purchasing another automatic litter box for when I go out of town, but it won't be a LitterMaid product. This product is garbage. Do not buy one."
3,Note possible health risk,"In general, these bottles are a great design. They are wide mouth, easy to fill and clean. You can see how much is left in the bottle and it has a measure on the side. The one liter size is perfect for use with water purification tablets.On the down side, please note that there is some research on possible cancer risks from the plastic in this type of bottle (not just the ones made by Nalgene). Google for a search phrase such as ""Nalgene recall"" and you'll see what I mean.Personally I decided to switch to steel bottles for hiking, and now I use these as storage containers."
2,Puzzled,"How can this be the same album as the CD, when it has 14 tracks, and the ""Mp3 album"" has only one track? The song is fine... I was just disappointed to end up with only one song after clicking on the link for the Mp3 version."
3,The Barbie is great...but the stable......,The Barbie included with the stable is great. She's jointed so she can sit on Tawny or other furniture because she has knee joints. My daughter was thrilled she could sit her down without her legs poking straight out. The stable leaves A LOT to be desired. Truly you're paying for the Barbie in this instance. The Barbie gets 5 stars and the stable 2-3 at best.
5,Barbie Dream STable Playset,My Daughter loves this stable set. She always sets it up when she brings her Barbie's out to play. The horse is awesome too! If your Daughter loves Barbie or horses this is a must have.
2,The walking horse did it but the barbie and the cheap stables did not,"I guess you kinda need the rider but for the most part, the horse that walks is the star, and the barbie gets sat on the shelf"
5,Artistry of the Camera: A City in Transition,"Pittsburgh -- the smoky city at the end of an era -- Snap shots frozen in time through a sensitive and interpretative lens.Smith's book provides a true insight into the people, business and architecture of the Pittsburgh of the late Fifties. These were the days when Mayor Davey Lawrence was setting about to destroy and forget the old, ushering in the new. Steel was still king with its blast furnaces spewing smoke. Street cars still rumbled through city streets.For the reader interested in the nostalgia of the times, for those seeking the artistry of the lens, for the serious student of metropolitan evolution this book is a must read!"
4,A must have for American art lovers,"This book does a great job in documenting not only W. Eugene Smith's four years of extensive research and photographing Pittsburgh, PA but it also reveals a torment man's struggle in trying to capture something that we will never understand since his 6000 photographs of Pittsburgh set a standard for not only documenting a city but he also raise the bar in the artistic expression of black & white photography. The prints of Smith's work in this book are very good and edited quite nicely, included are some of the photograper's letters to his friend and relatives revealing the thoughts of a troubled genius in words that show he could have been a great writer, too."
3,Beam Me Up !!!,Wonderful toy !I wish that I had this when I was a kid!Oh well I have it now and plan on keeping it so I can give it to my son...when he's old enough.
2,Worked well for 2 months....,"It worked well for abut 2 months, after 2 months a few buttons stopped responding, they do respond intermittently if I press a few times, but overall the timer is not durable and unreliable, I cannot recommend it."
2,Hard to Set & Beeper Quits Working!,"My main complaint with this timer is the beeper quits working, and the timer becomes worthless! It was okay for a few years, but it quit emitting any sound.Initally, I did notice that I would have to sometimes repeatedly push the buttons to set the timer.I bought this timer from an Amazon seller and not directly from Amazon."
3,Presto Electronic Timer,Great product with a lot of built-in and very useful functions but not very durable.Plastic parts are starting to crumble from the heat in the kitchen but for the price/performance very good
4,Presto 04212 Electronic Clock/Timer,"Bought this as a present for my mother. She wanted to replace her classic egg timer which wasn't the most reliable and not very easy to set a precise time. However, this product is GREAT! A beautiful and large display make it easy for all ages to see. It's simple BUT has the ability to do more complex things. Very satisfied!"
1,Just Okay,"This timer is okay but I really would rather have just a simple, easy to operate timer. This is not easy to operate but I should have read reviews a little closer. My mistake!"
2,"Flimsy - one drop, and game over!","It was an OK timer while it lasted... I was annoyed by the ""feature"" that you are unable to ""cancel"" when a timer is in action - you either have to let the time run out or lose the pre-set time, but that I could live with... Unfortunately, it got dropped on the floor only after two weeks and died, and I wasn't even using the magnet. This product is too flimsy to last!"
2,Fragile. Handle with care.,First one was DOA. 2nd one worked great.Problem is that you have to be careful with it.You can't try to use it while it's stuck to your fridge.You try to press a button and it will unstick from the fridge and fall to the ground.After that happened several times it stopped working.They should never have put a magnet on the back if you can't push the buttons while it's attached.Slight design flaw. Now the clock works but the timers do not.I'm going to look for a more durable timer.
4,"Good, but can be better","I used this timer for more than two years. It is still working fine. I like it because it uses regular batteries instead of those tiny button batteries which are used up quickly. However, it could need some improvement before it can be better. First, the timer 1 has no memory. You have to reenter the time every time. Second, it is not convenient to push the memory button to circle back to the present timer setting, if you want to use the present timer setting. Third, after two years, the buttons become ""rigid"". You need to press harder to get the setting. Besides these, it is a good timer."
3,Presto Timer,"The digital part works really well, but the magnet fell off the back after a week and it is difficult to see at certain angles."
5,Presto Timer,The best!!! Love having 4 timers in one. ANDDDDDddd they work all four simutaneously. Have dropped many times and keeps on tickin. Counts up/down stop watch/day/date/clock. I am spoiled here. Hope I can still purchase unit when I need another one!!!
5,Fantastic Timer,"I love all the details of this timer--calendar (what timer has that?!), clock, stopwatch, and timers, of course. I think the neatest thing is that if you pass the time you wanted to set, you can go backwards back to the correct number of minutes. It is easy to use, easy to read and the magnet is good and strong. This was a great purchase and I recommend this timer to all."
2,Meh,This is difficult to use. I will admit I haven't read the instructions but I can't think of the last time I had to read instructions on an alarm clock or timer. It's small which is nice but the magnet doesn't stick that well to the fridge. Just okay.
3,Decent little timer,"Main critique--The magnet fell off within a few days of receiving this timer. Other than that, it's a great little timer."
4,Reading directions? PREPOSTEROUS.,"I usually don't have to read the directions for electronics--especially for something as simple as a timer, but this was an exception. I mashed buttons for about 5 minutes before admitting defeat. Having read the directions, however, I found that it's actually really great for my purposes. I use it in a lab environment, and the fact that you have to press ""set"" before changing the time ensures that you don't accidentally reset or change the time while you're working, sending your experiment up in a great plume of smoke smelling of cumin and disappointment.The clock function is great and very accurate. One caveat--the buttons are a little hard to press, but you get accustomed to it quickly."
3,insensitive buttons,"This timer does what I want. My only complain is that the buttons are rather insensitive. I have to press hard to start the timer. Every time I start the timer, I have to make sure that it is actually counting."
2,"Looks Nice, Weak Magnet","Got the Presto Timer after buying a Sunbeam timer at the local store.The Presto Timer looks nice, has a nice screen and the key layout is all right.Unfortunately, the magnet is real weak ""i.e. cheap"". Using the timer with the magnet holding it on a surface is dicey as the timer falls easily. I bought two and they both have that problem. Oh, after 1 week of use, the magnet came loose from the plastic. Drop this timer and the battery case opens and the battery flies out. At least the timer is still running!Yes!So if you don't care about the magnet, this is a decent timer.I will look for a timer that has a good magnet and a good layout.OH! The magnet from my Sunbeam timer fell off. So I glued it to the Presto Timer that lost its magnet (the old Westbend Timer we had lasted over 10 years without any problems until near the end). Its too bad Presto uses such a cheap ""plastic"" magnet. At least I was able to improve it. Hey Presto is empowering me.That is why!"
2,great timer but didn't work for long,"I love everything about this timer EXCEPT that after about six months of use the button for setting the minutes started to stick and then stopped working altogether, rendering the timer useless."
1,Love/Hate Timer,"I have 3 of the Presto Timers. I gave one to my daughter and kept the other two. At first I loved this timer with its programming features and great alarm sound. In no time the hate began as I had to push the buttons so hard to get them to work. Sometimes I pushed them sideways and more softly and eventually got what I wanted to came up. Then it hopped all around to the other items, like the date, time, hour, minutes, seconds. I had to push away to make it stop. The only thing that worked well was the clock. Used one timer for my diabetes testing and shots and the other acted the same. Since my medications are pretty much controlled by the clock I cannot rely on this timer and am currently shopping for another. Too bad, Presto is a well known brand."
1,Remarkably poor timekeeping,"I bought this mainly for use as a small clock with 24 hour display (like military time). The timer/stopwatch functionality was a bonus. I was quite pleased with the design, size, weight, and ease of use for my purposes.However, I soon noticed that the clock seems to gain 4 seconds per day, which is ridiculously awful. That's about a minute gain every two weeks! Totally ruins its usefulness as a clock for me.If you only want to use it as a kitchen timer and don't mind it displaying the wrong time (or don't mind resetting it every few weeks) , I suppose it'd be OK."
1,Garbage,"This timer is a piece of trash.I ordered one of these for my wife as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas, and by February, it was already having problems. By July, it had stopped working altogether.First off, the little metal clip that holds the ""kick stand"" for lack of a better term, actually protrudes into the inner workings and shorts out the timer. Causing it toconstantly reset itself any time the clip is moved, or even touched. We worked around this by taping the clip in the folded position. LAME! Obvious design flaw.It's now been six months or so, and it has stopped working at all. No display, no function, nothing. New battery and still no go.Wish I would have returned it when it first started having issues, but to my own fault, we tried to make it work.Now it's probably to late return it, and I'm out another timer.Add this to the ever growing list of cheap ""made in China"" junk products."
3,"Adequate, but somewhat difficult to use.","As one of the other customers mentioned, the buttons on this timer are somewhat touchy. If you do not push hard enough, the time does not register. It is adequate for my purpose, but it could have been of better quality. I could be wrong, but I don't expect that this timer will have a life longer than a year. I expected better from this manufacturer. My guess is that they are having someone else build the timer and putting their name onto it. On the upside, this is one of the few timers that display hours. Most only include minutes and seconds. So if you need to register more than 60 minutes, this would be worthwhile to purchase for the price."
2,sticky controls,"bought two and alas, both stopped working at the same time. I guess, they have a predetermined life of their own. when adjusting time, one has to learn to press the controls, whether sideways, center, top or down. just messy."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this little guy because I thought the idea of having multiple timers that had a memory was kinda nice. But once you've used set the timer and it's run its course, there's no way for it to get reset back to the time that you had set it before, without cycling through the memory of the timers to get it or just setting it again. That, for me, made the memory part rather pointless. What's the point of having a memory feature if you can't just hit the start/stop button again and it start again? That's why I gave the product the rather low rating. You can't push the start/stop button to start the time over again once it's finished, which was kinda the whole reason I bought it. So if you're looking for something like that, look elsewhere."
1,Doesn't work,I bought two of these. One never worked at all and the second one worked for awhile and then tonight it kept ringing and the only way to get it to stop was take out the battery.I have used clock timers for years and given them as gifts. I find this one is more difficult to use then other timers I have bought.The Westbend timers I have are great and still running after ten years.
1,Terrible Junk,"I bought this about a year ago and it is such a terrible piece of junk. The little wire that allows it to stand up didn't last for 3 weeks. After only a couple of months I had to punch the buttons more than once to get them to work - and it now requires multiple pushes on all of them. This is, without a doubt, one of worst products I've ever bought. How bad is it? Well I've never even bothered to write a review on anything before, but this just demands it!"
1,Presto Kitchen Timer,"Timer does not work - date doesn't stay set. Keeps resetting. Sometimes just blanks out screen. Then later alarm goes off in drawer. Crazy. Can't rely on it. To get it out of the package I had to destroy the packaging, so can't send it back. Plus shipping would be half of the value, which at $12.99 seemed like a bargain, but is a waste."
1,timer is hard to work,bought three of these to use in a training and i think the fact that it was inexpensive is the key to the problems.it's just hard to work! the key pads are small and one of the three has already gone kaput. sigh.sometimes it's not a good thing to buy something site unseen.
1,"Sorry, do not waste your money","Sorry, do not waste your money. The button does not work after a few times of useage. Surprised for its quanlity."
3,Ok,"I had to replace my old Oregan Scientific timer, which I absolutely loved. This timer has very stiff buttons and is a bother to set. It works just fine. There aren't that many options, unfortunately."
2,"Looks good at first glance, but...","First thing I noticed when I got it out of the package is that the battery cover was flimsy. After I started using it, said cover had a tendency to fall off. Thankfully, the battery does not come out easily so that wasn't much of a problem. But now, since putting it on repeatedly, the cover is now broken. After only owning it a month, the unit does not work at all. Cannot explain why. I loved the features and ease of use of the product. But it didn't last long and the construction is wanting. Now looking for a new, different timer."
1,Inaccurate,"I bought this as a small kitchen clock for the windowsill, not caring about its timer features. Unfortunately, the clock does not keep time accurately. It gains about 2 minutes every 5-6 days. So once a week, you have to correct the time. This is annoying.It's too bad -- it's the perfect size and shape for my needs."
3,Cost me about 1.25 per day.,"I purchased the Presto 04212 Timer in Aug 11, 2010; it lasted until Dec 6, 2012. After nominally 600 days the timer switches were beginning to fail. Though the timer continued to function, the response of the switches was slower and often needed repeating. After about 850 days of use, half of the display faded out. With no other comparable timer available, I ordered another. I suppose at $0.0124 per day it is worth it."
4,Does the job,"My very old timer died. Nothing could revive it. I rushed to Amazon to find a replacement. This Presto timer seemed to be what I needed. It is very good.The only complaint I have is that it takes a bit of time to set it. You have to press the set button in turn to set the hour, minute, and second time. It moves rather slowly between each. Then setting the numbers for actual time is rather slow as well.The biggest plus is that the ringing at completion is very loud and insistent."
4,Functional,"GENERALThe product is compact and works well. I like that it lets me set alarms for two (and up to three or four) different events. I'm never interested in timing seconds, so there's always an extra unnecessary click to get past this field. There is also a stopwatch mode you might find useful. Because the unit does several things it is more complicated to program than simpler models.REFRIGERATOR USAGEI have it sticking by magnet to the refrigerator. It is awkward to click it while in this state, because it does not lie flush to the refrigerator (due to the magnet in the middle), and it takes a lot of force to make a click. Thus the unit buckles much of the time and you end up taking it off the refrigerator to set. The design could be improved by: 1) allowing it to lie flat; and 2) reducing the force necessary to click."
2,Harder to use than you would think,"Perfectly functional timer, but it is harder to use than you would think - a little tricky to toggle back and forth between timers. totally works, just not as easy to use as other timers."
1,I became a time master,"When this chromed up little beauty arrived, and very quickly I might add, it allowed me to time things in ways I had never dreamt of. My next conquest is space."
5,Unique timer,"What could have been a flaw turns out to be a plus. When the timer runs out and the alarm stops, the timer continues from zero up, letting you know exactly how long you ignored doing something the timer was reminding you about.Timer 1 does not remember a preset time but Timer 2-4 will. However, after a Timer has run, it sets itself back to zero rather than to your preset time. The preset time is there but you have to cycle through the Timers back to Timer X before it shows the preset time."
2,Malfunctioned in less than a month,"The timer worked great at first, but in less than a month, the alarm for the timer has stopped working and the magnet has fallen off. I am only keeping the timer because the clock and the stopwatch are still useful."
3,The tone is NOT loud,"I bought this timer because it states, loud tone. This timer is not loud at all. I can by a time at the dollar store that is just good. But still not loud."
1,stops working,"I had these for years and they worked great. But I ordered 2 more and they stopped working after a week.I tried again but no luck.I think the manufacturing has changed and now they're junk. Too bad, they were perfect."
2,Not easy to use,I wasn't very pleased with how this timer worked. I've already replaced it with a different style and brand. I wouldn't recommend it if you like to work with things in a hurry.
4,clock timer deficiency,"once we got it running it performs just as we thought it should. a very nice unit, however the instructions are sadly inadequate. i could not get it to operate correctly using the instructions. threw away the instructions and just hit buttons until i got it right. not the way it should be."
4,"mini timer/clock - perfect for me, but not everyone","My nightstand was cluttered with clocks, timers, etc. & I needed a compact, space-saving gadget that would give me the date & day at a glance plus a timer for timing the things in the oven plus ""lady"" things"". This does all of those things wonderfully & was just what I was looking for. The tiny stand in the back is perfect for my night table.Problem (for others): the magnet glued to the stand fell out after one day & I had never even tried to hang it up on the fridge, etc.Another problem: some of ""date"" numbers at the top are partially cut off making it hard to determine the date.I have yet to test all features, but alarm was quite loud. Easy to set up, but still can't figure out how to change AM to PM, so sometimes the top numbers are a day off. Soon I will have it mastered, I'm sure!Great little gadget for the price, but don't count on hanging it up."
5,clock/timer,was very nice and works well it also takes a normal AA batteries witch I like because the cost of the flat batteries cost to much.
3,does the job,I received the package on schedule. The timer is actually smaller than appears. Its back magnetic strip is not strong to hold the timer well.
3,Presto clock/timer,"I was hoping I could set the alarm to go off three different times of the day, but it doesn't work that way. Functions well, but not for the purpose we needed."
5,Great Timer,"I LOVE this timer. It has magnets, so it adheres to my range hood, keeps wonderful time, has a stop watch function and can be heard in the other rooms."
2,Broke down after 2 weeks,"I really liked this product - for the two weeks that it worked. It was never even dropped - and suddenly it just stopped working. Tried three different new batteries. Could never get it to work again. I procrastinated returning it. My own fault, the return window ended. I'm frustrated that I spent money on something that only lasted for two weeks."
2,Disposable?,"I used this timer to help me with a frequent medication schedule. It worked great for about three or four months, several times a day, then the beeper stopped working. I had not damaged it or gotten it wet so I don't know why. Changing the battery did not help. For occasional use it might be okay. The buttons are easy to manage and I liked that it had four timers in one. I guess when it comes to timers you get the durability you pay for. I'm looking for a better quality one that will last a while."
3,It's Okay,"Its not the best timer in the world, It is a little tricky to figure out how to set it but you get used to it. It's also very quite so stay in the room or room next to it or you might not here it go off depending on the thickness of your walls. Though I really like that it has a clock on it and its got a magnet on the back which I didn't know until I got it."
5,Clock and Four Timers,"This timer has worked well for me. I use it mainly in the bathroom - I like being able to see the clock from the shower to keep me on schedule, and I use the timer to prevent my children from draining the hot water tank. Also useful on the nightstand for short naps, and of course in the kitchen. I didn't think I'd use so many timers simultaneously, but I do find myself timing, for example, what's on the stove, what's in the oven, and how much time the laundry has left. It stands or clips on. It also has a magnet but our refrigerator is not magnetic, so I've never used it.Overall, a good purchase, and I'm here to buy a few more so my family will stop moving the one I have from room to room."
5,No problems after 18 months,"I've had this item now for 2 months. It has been working as you would expect.Update 18 months later: still working as you would expect. I have been using it in my office as a clock, as well as a timer to remind me of meetings. I am very happy with this purchase."
2,Unresponsive Buttons,"We've had this timer for about five years and I am on Amazon now shopping for a new one. We've liked the styling and functionality of this timer's various features and modes, but it has one fatal flaw: the buttons often do not respond to your touch, requiring two or three pushes of the button for a response. Perhaps this design flaw has been fixed on newer models, but on our timer, every single button requires the user to be extra vigilant and diligent about making sure your button-push 'took.' It's especially hard to get the timer to respond when you have to push TWO buttons simultaneously, as when you are clearing the previous time in the 'stopwatch' mode.I don't mind having to fiddle with this timer when I have the time, but on some critical applications where seconds count (film development in days of yore), this is not the timer you want to be using."
2,Junk,"I got this Presto timer as a gift. It worked fine at first, but now the stop/start button hardly works at all. Of coures, this is probably the button that I use the most. It's very annoying to put something in the oven, set the timer, hit the ""start"" button, then come back to the kitchen to find that the timer never even started!! The button has gotten so bad that I have to press it 5 or 6 times before it will start up. Also, the convenient magnet that was on the back didn't last. It came unglued about a week after purchase. I had better luck with my old West Bend timer. It lasted much longer."
4,Excellent.,"I've used many digital timers, many different brands. This is very good. The only thing that would make it better would be if it had individual numbers to punch in digits."
4,Delightful read,I liked the way the author set up the relationships between the characters that made them so believable. The villain in the book was surprising. My only complaint is that the ending was very abrupt. SPOILER ALERT I would have liked to know what happened to Roxanne and attend the wedding of Cash and Chelsea.
1,"Why, why why?","Way back before DVD's made deleted scenes and outtakes must-see experiences for many, Blake Edwards patched together a ""new"" Panther film from scenes left over from previous films. These scenes would have been great extras on DVDs for other Panther movies. Some of them are quite funny in an outtake kind of way. However, there's no way that this patchwork constitutes a real movie. And the half-hearted attempt at making this a ""tribute"" to Sellers in the credits comes across as exceptionally false when one considers that Edwards continued to make two dreadful Panther films without Sellers."
2,Death of the Pink Panther,"When Peter Sellers died in 1980, ""The Pink Panther"" series died with him. Unfortunately, director Blake Edwards thought otherwise and, in a ghoulish enterprise, tried to fashion a new ""Panther"" movie with Sellers' outtakes. It doesn't work. The outtakes are OK, but they would have succeeded better in a Sellers anthology or documentary. By the halfway mark, Edwards runs out of Sellers material and the film's contrived narrative comes to an abrupt halt. ""Trail of the Pink Panther"" is ultimate proof that you cannot resurrect a corpse from the cutting-room floor. It's interesting to note that Sellers' widow sued MGM/UA for this artistic desecration of her husband's comic legacy - and won."
2,in memory of peter sellers,"this is a compilation of all the pink panther movies as a reporter goes around asking clouseau's friends/enemies things about him. all the footage of peter sellers is from previous movies. it is basically a tribute to peter sellers movie, if your expecting a ""new"" peter sellers movie you will be very disapointed. overall it wasnt horrible movie, thus i gave it 2 stars, but it is not a movie you would want to watch over and over like all the rest of peter seller's movies.hope this helps."
3,Trail of the Pink Panther,"Trail of the Pink Panther is an odd film,it has some funny scenes, but I do not like the plot of Clouseau missing. It is an excuse not to show Peter Sellers. But Dreyfus makes up for it, by doing these funny gags about his blood pressure meter blowing up. A reporter talks to people who knew Clouseau, When she talks to Dreyfus he embarrasess himself in front of the TV Camera! Clouseau does some funny things when he is seen. But the plotline is kind of bad, first the diamond is stolen, then Clouseau is missing. Who is going to recover the diamond! You never find out what happens to the diamond. The scenes when you see Sellers, are unused footage from previous Pink Panther films. But, this is the best Edwards could do sence Sellers died two years before this film was made."
4,The saga continues.,"""Trail"" is a whole mish-mosh of things. Including outtakes which are pretty hysterical. Peter Sellers was a master. Quite disapointing that this was the first Pink Panther film I saw. The first half of the film was all right, but the second half it's kind of bland. David Niven's role has been reduced to almost a cameo part. He's so old, and Rich Little is dubbing his voice. A little on the bland side at some points, but I can get a few laughs out of it. We'll miss you, Peter!"
3,Strange Panther,"This movie starts out very good and is really funny. Then half way through it, Inspector Clouseau's plane becomes missing and so does Inspector Clouseau. A TV reporter looks for him but never finds out what happened to him or the plane. This is Peter Seller's last film as Inspector Clouseau but it is a very strange one indeed. At the end you see Clouseau from the back (you never see his face) looking out over an ocean and that's it!"
2,WHICH ONE WAS PETER SELLER'S LAST MOVIE?,The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu or this blob of bloopers? That is the question.
5,The most explosive and entertaining album ever!,"I first got into Genesis and Phil Collins at the urging of my brother. I now listen to and enjoy the band more than he ever recommended, and Invisible Touch is simply a great CD. Genesis was one of those bands before getting into that you've heard of, but aren't quite sure what songs they've done. When I first listened to this CD, I went ""oh, I've heard this one"" and ""I didn't know Genesis sung this one"", all of which are great songs. My favorite song of all time ""Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"" is on this CD and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the solo songs of Phil Collins. This is a great Genesis beginners album!"
2,What it was meant to be,"First of all, I don't dig this album. What amazes me is that anyone was suprised by it. This is where the band was heading with each release.Secondly, they made millions and millions. You can hardly blame them for it. It's not a good Genesis album, it IS a great pop album, which is what they were going for."
2,PHIL COLLINS' SOLO ALBUM,"Phil Collins took total control of Genesis and one of the results is this tasteless album, totally comercial-orientated. The only two catchy worth songs are the title track and ""ANYTHING SHE DOES"". This seems another band, this is no Genesis at all, it seems a Phil Collins solo album. You can almost begin to hear he starting to compose his soundtracks for Disney... Blergh !"
2,"NOTHIGN AGAINS POP, BUT...","I have nothing against pop ( I'm lying, I have !!). GENESIS truned to pop. Ok, they deserv to make some money. But turne into bubblegum music, my God !!!! The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's clear COllins, Banks and Rutherford are great musicians. What a disgreceful album."
2,"a lot of hits, but also a miss","Invisible Touch has a lot of hit songs on it, and at the time of its release was hugely popular. However, I don't think it held up over time. The ballads (In Too Deep, Tonight Tonight Tonight, Throwing It All Away) are decent but tiring and too plentiful on the album. The pop tracks (Invisible Touch, Anything She Does) are energetic and catchy but sound very dated. The standout track is Land of Confusion. Not really a bad album, but not nearly as good in 2008 as it was in 1986."
3,Their strongest post Duke album,"This album continues where the last album left off. More electronic 80's synth pop, with catchy and easy to dance to songs. This was their most successful album commercially, in that five of the eight songs were rather big hits.Listening to the album today, it does sound rather dated, as this brand of synth pop is not quite in style anymore. It's interesting how their older albums with Gabriel, actually sound less dated than this. Nevertheless, it's not a bad album. The title track is a bit irritating, and this album is not without its share of whiny sappy love ballads. But the ballads here are actually a bit better than the ones they had been doing before. The good does outweigh the bad on this album, securing it 3 stars."
1,Lord Almighty!,"Yes, it is true: some purists do consider this piece of history as trash because it is pop rather than the progressive rock Genesis was known for. But that is really not the problem with this CD, here. The issue is simply that it is filled with weak, lack-luster compositions. It's not a question of credibility but yes one of quality. There's nothing wrong with doing pop (I love it, anyway) but this album is stale. ""Invisible Touch"" is the definition of what singles are today: lame. ""Land of Confusion"" might have a cool video but the song itself provides the listener with nothing, either lyrically or musically. ""In Too Deep"" is something that belongs in a Phil Collins solo album, complete with it's drum machine patterns and sapiness. Look, there's no point in going on and outlining ever track; the album is simply mediocre at best, a failed effort from three fantastic musicians AND songwriters who seem to have definitely lost their Midas touch on this ""classic"" album."
3,Too Light And Commercial,"This album is almost a chore to listen to in its entirety. Don't get me wrong though; this album sports a good production and good playing, but still most of the songs are boring, stale, and unlistenable. Songs that are the best are: ""Tonight, Tonight, Tonight,"" ""In Too Deep,"" and ""Throwing It All Away."" It sounds like I don't like this album for the most part, but that's not completely true, there's just not much that's very interesting on here. An okay release. The previous album is a little better than this."
2,"Bah, humbug!","Fresh off their success with Abacab and the self-titled album, Gene$i$, with Phil Collins at the fore, foisted this banal, over-commercialized tripe on the world. The album's highlights are the driving Domino and the quirky instrumental The Brazilian, both of which hint at Genesis' art-rock past. The rest of the album is sadly infested with forgettably cheesy techno-pop. A worthwhile comparison is with ex-member Peter Gabriel's ""So"" - released at about the same time - which clearly shows that a commercially positioned release can nonetheless make a significant artistic statement. Artistically, Invisible Touch largely stands as a disgrace to the Genesis legacy, albeit highly beneficial to their wallets. I implore anyone new to Genesis to start with Second's Out, which showcases the band's true skills as writers and musicians"
1,Their worst album ever,"I used to be a big fan of Genesis when I was a teenager but this is the album that made me loose my faith. Commercial production, simple, uninteresting pop songs, it's hard to believe this band recorded ""Foxtrot"" and ""A Trick of the Tail"". Where were Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford? This felt like Phil Collins was in control. They made tons of money with this, good for them, but musically, this is a huge letdown."
2,INVISIBLE GENESIS,"Is this GENESIS ??? Phil Collins took creative control and nothing was the same anymore, only their bank account grew larger..."
1,THIS IS CRAP!,Why do people even like this cd. It is stupid machine driven overplayed junk. DO NOT GET THIS CD
2,Worst Genesis Album Ever,"Mostly Pop schlock on this CD. Other than ""Domino"" and ""The Brazilian which is an instrumental track, there are no Genesis style songs on this CD. This is closer to a Phil Collins solo CD than a Genesis CD. Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett must be asking, ""What happened to that great band we once played in?"""
3,The only decent Genesis album after 1978,"With the exception of ""Invisible Touch"", I wouldn't recommend ANY Genesis albums after 1978's ""And Then There Were Three.""Invisible Touch is a mixed bag, split 50/50 between good songs, on the one hand, and Phil Collins-style garbage on the other. Land of Confusion is fun and upbeat; Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, though arguably ruined by overexposure in a beer commmerical, is emotional and intriguing. The epic Domino and the instrumental The Brazilian are also great tracks with an exotic feel. But the rest is garbage, tracks you won't want to rip to your ipod. For the uninitiated, Genesis was a mighty band up to 1978.Indeed, according to Amazon sales ranks 70s Genesis albums on average sell much better than their 80s releases. You'll also note that used copies of the 80s releases can be picked up very cheaply - simply because they're of little value."
3,Somewhere Peter Gabriel Is Laughing,"As far removed from the Peter Gabriel days as you can get, Genesis removes all ties from the past with this one. The fact that Gabriel's magnificient ""So"" album came out around the same time only makes Invisible Touch seem even more shallow.The songs are listenable enough, but Tony Banks playing these songs is a little like Beethoven playing keyboards on a Britney Spears album."
1,Too synthesized,Man I hate this stupid album. Way too synthesized and the stupid love-dovey romance songs! Just goes to show you that pop music today is to be BANNED! I once got beat up by N-SYNC for real. Did y'all know that?
5,"Phil's masterpiece, a long way from More Fool Me","Sure when it came out, we all thought yuch! In retrospect, it's probably the best music craft by a major prog artist ever. Phil proves that he can write some really really good songs and we have to give him credit, he came a long way from More Fool Me! Another prog treat for the original fans Domino is one of Tony's best."
2,The Invisible Album,"I wish this album would disappear. Invisible Touch is an embarassment to everybody involved in making it. It also insults the intelligence of listeners. Songs like Invisible Touch and Land of Confusion are an obvious attempt to garner the attention of pre-cognitive record buyers.However, Anything She Does and Throwing It All Away are good pop songs. Thus, two stars.[DW]"
2,Horrible!!!!!,"It is... I gave it two stars cause Throwing it All Away is a great song, and Invisible Touch is a decent pop song... overall this is disgusting... especially when you realize that this band released such excellent albums as Selling England by the Pound, Foxtrot, The Lamb, and even Trick of the Tail (first album with Phil Collins singing lead)... this album is gross... it's trying to make eighties pop sound like progressive music, and it just doesn't work... The Brazilian is horrible... thank goodness I bought this second hand..."
2,"This is not Genesis , only a pop band (ab)using the name.","If you like to sing and dance , then this CD is for you , now if you ever enjoyed Trespass , Foxtrot , Selling England , Trick and the Lamb, then this is the worst ever CD that Genesis made , take it to a disco and have fun but if you want some nice pop then get Tears for fears or A-ha, a better choice .Genesis made great music but with the fame came money and then hits and now they are no more.Mr. Banks is obsessed with fame and fortune , large concerts and no art at all so do not expect anything that can be called Genesis here , only a megaseller , that's all...."
3,"Solid, well crafted pop music","Funny how most -not all- reviewers feel forced to say ""this album is not Selling England by the Pound, but..."" But what? Selling England is pure rubbish, pretentious, badly put together, everything Invisible Touch is NOT. Sure, many songs here were designed to be late 80's radio hits, which should be a good thing and does not imply it's bad music at all. In fact, I should say the worst song of the album is The Brazilian, which sounds like prog rock, but the worst side of it: lotsa sound effects, little or no musical ideas. The best of this album is probably Throwing it All Away, a few minutes of perfectly crafted pop ballad, worth more than half an hour of overinflated early 70s symphonic crap."
1,Horrible,"I'll admit, my favorite period for this band is 1970 - 1975 aka ""The Gabriel Years"". And there were some excellent albums released in the following years (Trick of the Tail, Wind and Wuthering), and yes I even liked And Then There Were Three, and Duke). What happened here??? This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. I still remember where I was the first time I heard the title track, that's how unbelievably disappointed I was. When I first heard the ""Mama"" album, I thought that it was the beginning of the end, listening to this album only confirmed it, and that's sad, because this was, IMHO, one of the greatest, most talented bands ever. Also, I went to a show that tour,in Philly, thinking that possibly the ""Live"" magic would still be there, at least. I couldn't have been more wrong, we left before the concert was over."
2,Nunca Genesis fueron peores,"Aunque cuando era más joven me sentía capaz de disfrutar con parte del ambiente reiterativo de ""Tonight tonight"", ahora creo que sólo un tema de este disco merece ser rescatado: ""The Brazilian"". Casualmente es un tema que el propio Steve Hackett dice admirar. Lo demás es musiquilla comercial. Trivial cuando se torna rítmica e insoportablemente melosa cuando Collins se descuelga con alguna de sus baladitas. Ni siquiera la mini-suite que se incluye en la segunda parte del disco merece la atención de un aficionado a la música de los viejos Genesis creativos. Un fiasco."
2,"Good, but not Gabriel","It always seems to happen. Bands make great music. Yet,for whatever reason, the singer leaves to go to bigger and better things. (David Lee Roth anyone?) Genesis went on to a more commercially successful career without Peter, but like Van Hagar, can you even begin to make an argument as to which singer was better? Unlike Diamond Dave, at least Peter didn't humiliate himself by going at it alone! Genesis made cute little pop tunes with Phil, but, us ""real"" Genesis fans know who put Genesis on the map!!"
5,Pop at its finest,"Okay, i might be a little biased. I grew up on this album. It was the first album I ever owned ( the tender age of 5). I have been listening to this for 15 years, and I love it more each time. The tunes display the band's full ability, ranging from the delectable ballad ""In Too Deep"", to more involved stuff like ""The Brazilian"" and ""Land Of Confusion"" (my personal fave), to the pure energy found in ""Invisible Touch"" and ""Domino"". Overall, this album is perfect and the quintessential item to any Phil Collins and/or Genesis collection."
2,An Album Just to Sell,"Phil Collins have took Genesis in to a commercial new direction. They could learn that commercial success and quality do not have why to be in opposite stages, but this time might be too late . If you compare this album with its fellow Peter Gabriel album, ""So"", you can see a big contrast. ""So"", though it has hit songs, shows that Gabriel could keep the art that his three ex-partners, could . . . but simply they did not want to keep. Nevertheless, only two songs in this album deserve a little bit (just a little bit) of respect: ""The Brazilian"" and ""Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"", because Genesis made a little effort to show a complex sound. But they have got lost in the ""Green Bills' Empire"", a long time ago."
3,GOING OPENLY TOWARDS MAINSTREAM,"THat's exactly what happened with Genesis in this album. People keep saying this is a master-piece, but it isn't."
2,A bad pop album,"The Last Domino at 10 minutes and 43 seconds remains the 4th longest Genesis song, The Brazilian is a fine instrumenal and Tonight has a strong middle section but this album is nothing new for the trio, bad pop and very little real talent."
3,Windows XP Problems -- poor support,"I used the product just fine with added software for Win 98 SE, but when I upgraded to XP Pro, I have not been able to get it to work. I have downloaded drivers and talked to tech support but still have not gotten the problem resolved!!"
5,Breath of FRESH air!,"I bought Peter's ""Music Box"" & ""Stirrin' Up The Water"" CDs last year and haven't listen to anything as much as these two since. If I could write and produce songs like this I'd be a happy man, well lets just say way happier. The dynamics, musicianship, detail and production chops on these two albums are stunning. Forget that he is Jimmy Buffett's guitarist... you'd never know it. Any recording musicians out there that need inspiration... this is it. Total ear candy. Truly an original breath of fresh air."
5,Not only a great: singer/songwrite/musician/composer/etc.etc,"Peter has his own recording studio and does all the sound mixing for Jimmy Buffett. He has years of experience and talent; even enough to make Jimmy sound good. When someone that knows the how and why behind taking something that sounds good and making it sound great becomes the artist, they start with great and make it superb. Music Box is just that, superb!"
4,Buyer Beware - There are 2 artists named Peter Mayer,"One Peter Mayer is from Minnesota, is a folk singer, and has albums such as Bountiful and Million Year Mind. There's another musician named Peter Mayer. He hails from St. Louis, had a band called PM, has albums such as Green Eyed Radio, Romeo's Garage, and Spare Tire Orchestra, and also tours with Jimmy Buffett. Both are excellent musicians, but make sure you are getting the one you want."
5,Should be required listening,"Peter Mayer, brother Jim, Roger Guth, and the rest of this band are some of the most brilliant musicians to come together and form a band. This album is fantastic from start to finish. Peter's voice and guitar work, the wonderful lyrics, and the stylistic melodies are a pleasure to listen to again and again. Very relaxing yet inspiring music. This is a must have for every music lover!!!"
5,"""echad"" means our soul is one.","I understand completely being unsettled by the term ""Jewish soul"" as if it were something higher or different from any other soul. Please understand that the term ""Jewish"" is only ""one who walks the path of G-d"". Whatever G-d is to you, the Universe, the Collective Soul/Consciousness, Divine Light... so long as you are seeking to act according to Truth, so long as you struggle to listen, or surrender to hear- constantly or again and again; you who walk towards unity and/or clarity, you may read this book and know that it is indeed addressing you. Do not let language interfere with truth."
1,A mere collection of intellectual ideas,"Rabbi Ginsburgh has obviously done a great amount of work in gathering all of the ideas that he has presented in this book. Unfortunately the work is severely marred by Mr Ginsburghs horrible beliefs about the difference between ""Jewish"" and ""non-Jewish"" souls. We are to believe, that somehow, the Divine Spark dwelling in a Jewish body is fundamentally different to the Divine Spark dwelling in a non-Jewish body. This book is strictly the work of an armchair theorist."
5,Always Solid,You can almost be sure it will be good if Sammy Nestico has a hand in the arrangements. This CD is one of those that you will enjoy over and over and over.
1,Not for the current SAT,"This is probably a terrific review tool...for last year's SAT. On the cover is the warning: ""For all tests throught January 2005""."
4,All previously released,"All materials in this DVD is extracted from a previously released DVD set: Carlos Santana Presents: Blues at Montreux 2004 (2006).THERE IS NO NEW MATERIAL IN THIS DVD. Buyers beware.That aside, it is a bluesy side of Santana not to be missed."
1,Completely breaks after minimal usage,"After owning for one week and using only about 15 times it no longer holds the toast down, and is therefore completely unusable. Honestly, who would expect that nowdays you'd have to research before you bought a toaster? It's a TOASTER for crying out loud! How hard is it to make a toaster? Definitely stay away from ALL toastmaster products. Any company with a complete lack of product testing is bound to have other products that are just as bad as this worthless toaster."
4,Really nice toaster,"I've had this toaster for at least 4 or 5 years. Use it almost daily and have never had a problem. It toasts well and consistently. If I want something really dark, I may have to toast it twice, but I tend to like my stuff only mildly toasted. I'm not sure what happened to the reviewers who rate it awful, but like I said, I use it on a very regular basis, have used it hundreds of times, and it works great!"
3,Toastmaster Toaster,"I had a Toastmaster toaster before and it worked well, but it finally gave way and I figured how could I go wrong with another one? But the same model was not available, so I got another model that seemed to fit the bill. It toasts ok, but bread can easily get stuck behind the internal grids. For a new toaster, I was surprised. It doesn't do a bad job, you just have to be careful aboujt inserting the bread."
1,returned it,Bottom line was the levers that you push down to toast the toast (or whatever you are toasting) didn't stay down. : (Had to return it. I should have paid attention to the other reviews. Returned it.
1,Piece of Junk!,"I just bought this toaster yesterday. We went to use it for the first time and one side doesn't even BEGIN to toast. The elements don't heat up even. The other side did try to do its job. But, after waiting a ridiculous length of time we turned it to cancel and the normal slice of bread got caught in the slot and we had to dig it out. This is going back to the store immediately. Ugh!"
3,"A flawed book, but worth the read","Here's a chance to read about a wrestler's first steps in the business. There is no bigtime ""Wrestlemania"" payoff at the end. Only the knowledge of more hard work and dedication to come. It isn't a well-written book. For instance, part the way through the book you find out she's married. Even later, you find out that she's been in the military. These and other things are important to the development of her story. They shouldn't be a surprise. I also found it a bit annoying when she gives advice as if she's an old veteran. That is something that Mick Foley, Moolah or Jerry Lawler can do, but not her...yet. Of course, she's a wrestler, not a writer. So, if you can look beyond those things, it's a good inside look at the struggle of someone who loves what she does, someone to be admired."
3,Storming on the world of wrestling,"Very good book very well written. Interesting look at the current indy scene, should talk more about the inside of the business than describe her matches. The Precious Lucy story at the beginning of the book is accurate of the female worker I know, but it seems like she either going to discover that one promoter is not a genius or a great person. She also just might be looking to still work for him in the future and his working him in the book before sending him a signed copy. A must for all fans looking to go into the business."
3,Pop Culture Cliches and Age Old Truisms,"This was an attempt at being clever. It provided many colorful examples of the things most urban dwellers come to realize by age 10. Packed full of common sense observations that could enlighten only the typical unaware suburban consumer.I believe this book was an effort by the author (likely a typical suburban consumer) to share a recent personal discovery, US Econimic Policy = Careless Consumerism.Though I am certain that the author was entertained, as clever as this book was written; with its lack meaningful insight, it makes better fiction that anything."
5,a must-have for high math scores,This book really helped me review for the math section of the SAT. It covers every type of question and gives a thorough review of every math concept you will need to know for the SAT. I highly recommend this book if you are looking to raise your scores significantly.
5,Helped Me Design Exam,"I had to design a multiple choice math exam and found this Barron's SAT Workbook to be a perfect resource. It breaks down the areas covered in the mathematics SAT and provides plenty of multiple choice questions along with answers and explanations. There are also sections that teach the concepts as well.If students that plan to take the SAT would have this book as a resource, they'd have the opportunity to assess their strong and weak points and focus on building up the weak areas. That's really how one can most efficiently raise a score in preparing for a standardized multiple choice exam.Since the truths of mathematics don't change, this book is not about to become dated. It's really a good idea to get all the multiple choice questions one can, as long as answers and explanations are provided. The larger the sample set, the less chances for surprises on the actual exam."
3,personal student review,"As a peer studying for the SAT i recommend this book to those that have reviewed the official SAT workbook, kaplan, and also princeton review. this book show problems that are extremely difficult compared to the regular test but it is a good book to review if your planning to score at the 2100-2400 range."
2,DECENT!,I recently purchased this book as a way for me to better improve my Math SAT score. So far I am very pleased with this purchase. I hope to raise my Math SAT score by 200 points for the next SAT. Satisfied so far...
5,One of the best tunes in my box,"This has to be one of the tunes of the year. Everywhere I play this tune people are up on the dance floor screaming for more, with those banging hard beats warming you up for the best part when it drops into a trance break that will get anyone to there feet and start rocking.Possible the best tune of the year. DJ NOIS-E-NOMAD"
4,A Slightly Incredible Plot,HAVEN is a story about the increasing vulnerability of any country to the crazed actions of a few fanatics. The author does a commendable job of wrapping up too many loose ends of a slightly incredible plot.
3,Havoc on Hilton Head Island,"I just finished 'Haven'.....would somebody PLEASE tell me why Aisha's uncle was so obsessed about finding her?.......was it to ensure that he would control the fortune she would inherit after the death of both parents? The book seemed to point to the fact that she had something to do with a deal he was cooking up with who? The Libyans.....the Egyptians? It was confusing because it kept alluding to the notion that perhaps this had something to do with the warheads, radiation, biological warfare etc. I don't consider myself stupid but while I was reading this book took allot to stay focused because it seemed to keep wandering......and wandering.....and now I suppose we will see Kessler again because he managed inspite of a gut wound and exposure to radiation to get away.......hmmmmmmmmmm"
2,"Not as bad as the other one I read, but needs originality","After I finished this book, I realized that I'd read and reviewed another of this author's book, ""The Shadow Box"". After criticizing it the author emailed me a letter ( you can read it under the reviews of ""The Shadow Box"" ) in which he insults me personally for not liking his work then proceeds to state that he will ""delete any response unread"". It seems that he cannot even defend and/or try to understand any point of view other than his own. Someone this defensive must not be very proud of their own work. So beware, write a good review or you'll receive hate-mail."
1,trash,searched for a commswitch 3500. these worked great but are discontinued. the stick and the emerson 718 are trash don't waste your money.
5,"Highly recommended, check it out!","This is one of my all time favourite jazz fusion album. If you've never heard of Mezzoforte, they're a great fusion band from Iceland(!) Musically a bit like Casiopea, Spyro Gyra, Rippingtons, but they are also very original. Track 2 Take off is a good example. Fiona is softer and wonderful. This is a CD best experienced on HiFi(and not tiny computer speakers) esp. the new remaster with doby surround. These were originally recorded in the eighties but jazz fusion doesn't seem to age that bad. Other albums: 'Surprise, surprise' is very good too and so is 'Observation'. 'Daybreak', 'Playing for time', and 'No limits' just ain't that hot. It seems that their album is either good or bad and not in between. 'Fortissimo' is a 'best of' album that is wonderful but has a few tracks redone with vocals on it that ruined it for me."
5,The best Pop record EVER!!,"Friends is the best Beach Boys album ever made and one of the finest by any band ever. There is not one bad track. A true group effort. Stunning contributions by Dennis. Amazing production by Brian. Busy Doin' Nothin' is incredible.Friends, Anna Lee, Wake The World, the list goes on. Contrast this with Pet Sounds. The stylistic differences and production values are incredible. The most versatile and experimental pop group in history. What Happened?!!!??"
3,Comprehensive,"It is a good atlas for a trainee. It includes difficult part of body with a precise label. However, it is not easy to find the one that you want since there are plenty of labels. In addition, I think it is much better if there are few sentences to elicit the information concerning the radiological imaging like certain common normal variants that one could see in the radiological imaging"
3,"great images, little additional info","Great image quality and very inclusive of several disciplines, including X-ray, CT, MRI and some ultraound made studying easier. The presentation of both axial and sagitall images was also helpful. It was howver very disheartening that the vertebral levels for each image were not identified. This made it less useful for initial studying that I had hoped it would be.Overall a very good study tool, not great for self-taught study though"
3,Medical School Resource,Good for images of normal human anatomy on X-ray. Not particularly helpful at Mercer University SOM.
5,Good Product !!!,"Nice model, good leather, looks great for price !!! I use it to care 15"" laptop.Exactly what I was expecting ;)"
4,satisfied with slicer,The slicer seems to work well. Its lightweight and easy to clean. I used it for a large boneless ham (7 lbs) that I had cooked and had leftovers. It shipped quickly and was easy to set up. I think it was a good value for me for my occasional uses.
2,Mediocre,I used this slicer for a number of years and am now replacing it. It is a pain to clean and thin slices are not consistent. It is compact to store since it folds up. I would not buy another and I would not recommend it. It was cheap and I got what I paid for.
2,Poor powertrain design,"Worked ok for a while, but doesn't really have the power for slicing meat. After a dozen or so uses, the motor runs but the blade does not turn. Opened it up and found that a metal worm gear drives a soft plastic gear attached to the blade. The plastic gear was completely worn out. This design is not meant to withstand slicing anything but bread for more than a year of light usage. It was an inexpensive slicer, but it's not worth the money for how long it lasts. Save up for a quality slicer."
2,Slicer review,"This item is just o.k. It does slice the cheese, salami, etc., but not necessarily evenly. It also is difficult to hold the meat, cheese, or whatever and press the button and move it to slice all at the same time. It really works better if two people are doing the operation. It also takes some doing to take it apart and wash all the parts after use. I would definitely not have ordered it if I had known how much trouble it would be to use."
4,PRETTY GOOD,"I have used this slicer for meats and breads and vegetables and overall it is reliable and does the job consistently.No bells and whistles,comes apart easily for cleaning and is easy to assemble.Just keep it out of the way of children:that blade is SHARP!"
2,Almost good,"This slicer quickly cut my home made corn beef into perfect deli thin slices...and then just as quickly turned a loaf of my home-baked bread into a pile of useless crumbs. The slices would not feed all the way through and broke up. I could have used a third hand, by I only have two hands. I will use it for meat, but never again on bread."
4,cinbuck,"This the second Rival we have owned. The first was the prior model, and it lasted 30-40 years. Nothing fancy, it just gets the job done."
3,Perfect for large gatherings,This item was purchased specifically for parties. It does a good job of slicing large quantities of meats and vegetables. Firm and equal pressure is required when guiding the food stuff through. This is not meant for commercial use. The biggest drawback (to me) is that it is difficult to clean.
4,quick service,"recieved slicer quicker than i expected, great!. works well bought one myself a while back this one is for my father. thank you again for the quick service."
1,Not easy to operate,"AS has been stated above, this machine really takes two people to operate. The safety button has to be held down while slicing, making only one had free. On my unit, the plastic part that controls the thickness of the food being sliced, keeps coming off, so slices do not come out evenly. We were trying to slice a beef brisket I made, became so frustrated with how much work it was to slice, and how ad the slices were turning out, I took out my mandoline and finished slicing with that! Definitely would never buy this unit or recommend this to anyone. We have used this a few times, thinking we were doing something wrong, but each time we get the same results.This unit is also difficult to clean. All in all, not worth the trouble!"
1,planned obsolescence,"This slicer is sold under several brand names such as Toastmaster or Rival.After approximately 6 uses the metal worm drive coming off the motor had eaten the plastic teeth off of a plastic cog rendering it useless. I will upload a picture.This was a gift, I did not buy it from an Amazon vendor, and I am assuming that all the food slicers that look like this one are the same."
4,Great for slicing bread,"For doing the type of job I want it to do which is slicing bread it is great. It can stay on my counter where I use it daily, and it looks great because I close it and put the slide in the cupboard above. The size of the slice is simple to set. The only problem I have with it is that my loaves are big and when I pull the slider out far enough to handle the bread it hits a wee bit of a stopper and has to be lifted slightly over this, but I wouldn't want anything bigger sitting on my small counter so I can put up with lifting the slider slightly at that spot."
3,somewhat pleased,"I like the compact design but the foldable feature makes the machine less sturdy, especially when cutting hard meats.Otherwise the cleaning is easy and I can put it back neatly in the box when not in use."
1,Unsmooth track for moving part,"When we try first time, we found the moving part can be blocked by unsmooth track (where two planes meet). Not a good product."
3,Very flimsy,"You get what you pay for I guess.The slicer works OK, but is of a really flimsy construction. I already have 2 broken off pieces of plastic from this slicer, although we handled it quite careful.Also, the guide doesn't pull back far enough, so it's difficult to slice larger items like our home backed bread.Wouldn't recommend it."
1,PRODUCTS SUCKS,"I bought this item upon reading the reviews. I don't know how these users can say this a a good product for bread, it is not! Bread sticks while trying to slice.Can'tRival 1042W Electric Food Slicer, Whiteexert presure on bread because its too soft, therefore you get a slice thats deformed. Bread gets hunk-up on bottom of blade and you get a deformed slice. Bread is to wide for machine. Save your money, use an electric knife."
4,Cutting Edge,The 2nd film on this DVD is called Heart Beats Fire. I saw it at the San Francisco film festival and it blew me away. It took me on an emotional roller coaster from beginning to end.
3,Good product but not compatible with the headphones,"*Be careful when ordering this product!*I ordered this product off of amazon.com as a Christmas present for a friend in '08. There was an offer to include compatible headphone so I got those. When my friend received them, the headphones WERE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH this particular case.He was lucky in that he just exchanged them at a local shop, but buyers be warned!It is a good product and works great when you have the right pieces. Suggestion-buy them both separately to make sure you have the right ones!"
5,Great Product,This is a great product. It allows me to bring my ipod to the pool and not worry about it getting ruined. It has a nice belt clasp so I can carry it with me where ever I go. I have accidentally dropped it a few times and it has protected the ipod nicely. I have not dunked it under water but it is supposed to work underwater with waterproof headphones. I am very happy with this product and I am glad to have spent the 35 dollars on it.
1,poor,I used this product for lap swimming. As soon as I jumped into the pool water got into the otter box and ruined my ipod.
5,Working great,I bought this for my wife's birthday. She swims most days and was desperate to be able to listen to music. I was worried about killing a perfectly good ipod but gave the Otterbox a try. She's been using it for the last few weeks and loves it... no problems at all.She is using it with the H3 Waterproof Headphones. She did not like the wrap around frame but we could easily take that off and now it works great.
5,works beautifully,"Works as advertised. I'm using it with the H3 waterproof headphones while doing laps and I can listen to music to break up the monotony. The clip is sufficient for securing it to my shorts; a band or other harness is unnecessary for me. Only issue is that I'm finding it impossible to change the volume once I'm in the water, probably because the wetness interferes with the touch function. Make sure you adjust volume before you get in the water. Clicking the buttons works just fine though, so you can skip songs or pause or turn it off with ease. Be advised that this case is rather large in comparison to just the Nano itself, and while not quite a brick, it is probably more than what you are expecting."
3,This is a COMPACT Toaster! Small Slots!,"This is an adorable toaster and would have been a perfect companion for our antique pink stove, BUT it has slots that are so short that a regular-sized slice of bread will barely fit. Sourdough or rye would be impossible.We are returning the toaster and are disappointed to discover that the only other two-slot toaster available, the Cuisinart, is also a compact. Phooey."
1,Received a dud!,"I am glad this product worked for others, but I must have been sent a dud. I tried to use it for the first time and the lever would not stay in the locked position. The LED lights were not functioning and then to add insult to injury, the cheap pink handle popped off! I did all of the trouble shooting and it is definitely the toaster. It would heat up while I was holding the handle down, but it wouldn't stay down. I am returning this and will not order another. Even if it would have functioned, the cheap handle keeps popping off. Also, it just feels cheaply made. My previous toaster was a Cuisinart. I will be purchasing one of those instead. The one good thing I can say is that it is a very pretty pink toaster. That is it. Good luck."
1,Falls Apart,"Purchased this toaster because we had Kitchenaid in the past and was happy with their product. Have had this one now for two months and have to be careful when you pick it up as the outer plastic shell seperates, top from the bottom and the lever handle falls off. Working with Kitchenaid now to get a replacement, but not betting on it being any better."
4,It's big and pink.,"It is a quality toaster, no doubt about it. I suppose the pink color is a bonus. I scored this here on Amazon."
1,light bulb?,"I thought this might work, well they sent me this bulb, with no instructions on how to use and just a bulb, so it's going back as fast as I got it."
2,Not Like The Picture,"The photo is misleading. The set of onyx coasters that I received is BROWN, not green, and rather ugly. I know natural stone is not homogeneous, but this is something else. Each coaster looks like a blob of something unmentionable."
3,"Decent book, but a little to simple","""To Face the Sun"" is Pacific war-time romance from Frances Patton Statham, American Amanda ""Sunny"" Fitzpatrick meets Englishman Alex Ramsey on a hospital ship, after the ship sinks the meet again on Guadalcanal. Of course the two fall in love, Alex ends up in a POW camp and Sunny thinks that he is dead, but then after the war, she finds out that he is still a alive and they get back together.I am a big fan of war-time setting books, but this book was just to simple and I just knew what was going to happen, but as I said before its a decent book for a rainy day or car ride"
4,"Much prefer this to ""It's Deductible""","I am a TurboTax user which now has ""It's Deductible"" included as part of Intuit's overall Federal income tax calculation program. In the past I have found ""It's Deductible"" to be intuitive and comprehensive -- a breeze to use but this year there appears to have been some changes which have made it clumsy, difficult to read and navigate, and generally confusing. When I purchased DeductionPro as an alternative I was pleased to find a program that was actually pretty simple and easy to use. The only problem is that information compiled in DeductionPro only imports into TaxCut. So if you are a TurboTax user like me, you end up having to reenter alot of the same information from DeductionPro into TurboTax -- an extra annoying step but easier than trying to use ""It's Deductible."""
1,Question about this book.,Any one who bought this book: CD on the book is working? I mean if we can install and then create a database and run a 4gl program? thanks
2,Blah,"My daughter just HAD to have this head, we opened it up and discovered that the eyeshadow stuff doesn't change color and neither does the hair, (yes we followed the instructions for this) a lot of the little hair accessories broke within the first day, and it's nearly impossible for my daughter to use them in her hair, so that frustrated her. I definately would not purchase one of these again. It now just sits in her closet, oh well!"
5,It will capture your heart!,A truly endearing fun movie with a great sound track that isn't available in stores or anywhere! The movie's so neat I rented it twice in one week! See also HATE (la haine) by the same director with the same characters - produced by Jodie Foster!
2,Best Thing About This Film Is The Cover On The Box,"Not a good film. Hard to follow and at times makes NO sense. The dialog is bad and not believable. The woman is beautiful, and if If it were not for this I would have turned this movie off. When you see foreign films like this you realize that America makes the best movies. Pass on this one."
1,Piece of garbage,"very poorly compiled set. The set includes magnets for the back of the dresses but how do the dresses attach to the dolls? No clue! No directions were included. We got it in the mail and the pink ""closet"" box was p[packaged inside a brown cardboard box with nothing else in it. No pictures of the princesses on the outside, no directions NOTHING. What are the cardboard names of the Princesses for? No instructions for that either. In our opinion for 40.00 + shipping you should be given more instructions. What a waste of money, my 7 year old on Christmas morning is disappointed and has no desire to play with this because we don't have a clue how to use it!! Do not waste your 40.00. there are nicer paper dolls out there that don't need instructions to play with."
1,NOT as described!,"In the photo, these earrings did indeed look ""cute"" and ""small,"" as described. They are, in reality, chunky and about the size of a nickel...VERY hard to tell this from the picture. These earrings would be perfect with a bright yellow 80's power suit. Otherwise, steer clear!"
5,"OEM Part, Very good deal.","This switch unit fit my wife's 2001 pontiac grandam. I checked at O'reilly's website and the aftermarket part was something like $200. I work at a GM dealership, and I didn't even bother having them price it for me. Even with my employee discount it would have costed me 3-4 times as much as this. AC Delco is what you would get at a dealership, but not at a price like this. Great deal guys."
3,Entertaining if convoluted thriller,"In the tradition of The Crimson Rivers and Druids, this French language film loses something in the translation. But the idea is novel, even if it has been used before. It's not a great Lambert film, but's it worth it for die-hard fans.The film follows Jimi Dini (Lambert) - a computer game programer, who's latest game is infected with a virus. The result - the game's main character get's a mind of his own and realizes that nothing's real, even him. He begs Lambert to destroy the game, so Lambert sets out on a journey through a futuristic Europe to do so. Also, Lambert is looking for his long lost love, and he also wants to shut down the big computer corporation that runs everything.As I said the film is hurt in translation - and you don't always have a clear idea of what is going on. But the visuals are often stunning thanks to director Gabriele Salvatores and cinematographer Italo Petriccione, so that helps you through the story."
2,Forgettable Sci-Fi,"I am an avid sci-fi guy going back to when special effects were classic ""Trek"" style. A good sci-fi can be great without high-tech effects and/or CGI. This film was blessed to be made in a time with much more in terms of special effect possibilities than the original Trek or Twilight Zone, but the story and pacing of this movie is so unimpressive that even though I just watched this film in July of '12, I can barely remember it. That doesn't mean it was a bad movie, it's just entirely forgettable. That is truly an unforgiveable sin for any film."
5,Beats the Matrix,"This is a more low-key SF thriller in cyberpunk mode. Jimi has created a brilliant computer game, called Nirvana. However, one of his characters have developed sentinence, and wants to get out.In a way, the world of Nirvana is grimmer than that of the Matrix, since it so much more believable, with megacorporations with their own laws and those outside of the corporations, and, hence, outside of the system, live in squalid but vibrant undercity complexes or travel around with portable cyberconnections.The acting is superb with Christoph Lambert as a very credible burnt out hacker that just wants to be reunited with his dead wife.This realesa of this minor masterpiece is long overdue. It takes a little while for the film to get started, but when it does - it does it with a vengeance."
2,All 4 broke by the end of the season!,"Be careful where you place these in your batting cage, the first time they are hit by a ball they will split and are rendered useless. We ended up using the hardware and inside pad between some wood that we cut and it seems to work for now. The product should hold up to at least a couple of batted balls."
3,"Good value, though outdated","Editor Moses Hadas was a world-renowned scholar, and his notes can be helpful, but the translations he presented in this volume have become outdated. Most Greek translations sacrifice something through the morality, prudence, or artistic judgment of the translator. This is a fine text for the value, but if clarity is more important to you, seek a more recent translation."
5,Great!!,"As described, the book was in perfect condition and arrived in a timely manner. It came just in time for the beginning of the semester. I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,typical drama book,I gave this a four because it is just your typical drama - doesn't really provide background information just the text of the drama itself. Basic Greek drama - not much more to explain.
1,defective but fixed by electrician,"The light stopped working after about a week of use. An electrician friend was able to fix the loose wires inside at no cost to me. Without him, it would have been an expense to repair or a hassel & expense to return. The light is attractive and provides adequate light for the desk, but it is cheaply constructed."
1,Flaming dog poo,"Wow. That is all I can say. I want those 80 minutes of my life back. I feel like I actually lost brain cells after watching this thing called a ""movie."" Just horrid. Acting...awful. Writing...awful. Directing...awful. Blood...well, there is blood.This movie compares to junk on YouTube at best. Stay away unless you want to lose brain cells and waste $."
2,Not cool.,"I was fooled by the high star rating and reviews here on Amazon, and I thought this was going to be a throwback to old 70's and 80' explotaion classics, but it just ended up being a low budget version of Saw with bad effects and porn-grade acting.They just don't make tham like they used to. Maybe it's the digital cameras, maybe it's the fact that it's all been done before, or maybe directors just suck right now, I don't know and I can't put my finger on it, but I do know American Horror is in dire trouble.If you wan't to see some real Horror made in this decade I'd recommend watching foriegn films. The Asians (especially Japanese) are putting out some amazing stuff nowadays with thought out meanings and messages with extreme elements, and Criterion is also putting out some great stuff.I bought this movie for 5$ used, I was pretty dissapointed and I'm not sure if I will hang onto it, but it does have some decent soft-core porn stuff so maybe I'll keep it around for when I get lonely."
1,TOTAL WASTE,"I do not advise anyone to buy or watch this movie, it is a total waste of time and money, a 100% low class commercial movie with nothing interesting whatsover, do not even think of buying it !!"
1,Not what we expected,We agree with the reviewer who pointed out that this was erotica not romance. It probably is good if that is what you wanted. For us... we thought detective...romance...a little sex. It has no real story line after the beginning...not what we consider romance...it really is a lot of various sexual scenes put together.
3,"Great erotica, decent story","I am not going to do a rendition, I see this has been done. This book was not bad. I thought it lacked passion, but it did have hot steaming pages. Overall I thought there were no twists and turns to the plot to keep the actual story line going. The only thing good about this book is the erotica. I do recommend this book if you are not looking for a romance novel."
4,Very hot!! Very steamy! I want to find Jack!,"This was a really good book. It was hot and sexy and full of emotion. Some things were a little far fetched, but really, who cares. It wasn't too short. It wasn't too long. The sex scenes were good. One or two were a little poorly written, or maybe just poorly edited. Once you read it, you will see. But that didn't spoil the book for me.I want to read more from her."
2,Mind porn,"Need I say more? I have no problem reading something steamy, but there is a big difference between a romance and erotica. Label this what it is: erotica. Romance novels center around a conflict that brings the hero and heroine together, which results in the romance and subsequently includes sex as an ingredient. French Quarter: Hot in the City is pure sex intertwined around a feeble plot that only exists as a setup for raunchy sex. I haven't read anything this dirty since Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy."
4,Sizzling is an understatement,"The description wasn't exaggerating when it said ""sizzling hot"". I enjoyed the story of a woman coming into her own but it was really graphic. I tend to go for more subtle romance but this was a new experience. Good story but not for the faint of heart."
4,I'd Like To See Bourbon Street Like That!!,"As strictly erotica, this book is HOT! As romantica, not so much. There isn't much in the way of a plot, or character development. But if you're looking for some steamy sex in just about any way you can imagine (and some you wouldn't even begin to), then this is a book for you."
2,"Hmmmm, where was the story?","Ms. Alexander certainly knows about things. And the graphic, very graphic details about some of the various ways one can have sex are covered in detail. If you like voyeurism you would enjoy this book. If you are looking for something to read while you are alone and ""relaxing"" you might find this stimulating. The characters were shallow and one dimensional. The relationship in this story was strictly sexual, very sexual. It leaves me wondering if they didn't have sex would they even be together? I gave the book two stars because I think my husband may benefit happily from my having read the book."
1,Gross,"I am not a prude by any means, but I found this book to be gross. I only made it through 27% of it and I will not be recommending it to anyone."
1,French Quarter,I am a avid reader and enjoy reading books set in New Orleans. This book does have a plot but it's hard to follow plot when on every page the majority of the writing is about sex. I am not a prude but the story would have been much better if the extent ofSexual adventures would have been less. It ok but I do not plan on purchasing any future books from this author. SORRY!!!!!
4,Hot But Lacking Something,"I got this as a freebie and it definitely packed a punch in the spice department, but it's not for the faint of heart. It is almost overwhelming at times like the author was trying to fit in every type of erotic scenario you can think of and I mean everything, including m/f/m f/f m/m and m/f. So heed the warning if that's not your thing. The writing wasn't anything spectacular and it did get dragged out and little overly melodramatic but if you're looking for some steam this is definitely for you."
4,Hot and steamy romance at its best,"Grab a fan and a large supply of ice before reading, because this story will set you on fire. This incredibly hot story had my blood boiling from the first chapter. One of the best erotic romances I have read, with a strong steamy plot and a great hero and heroine in Liz and Jack - both were well-developed characters with fantastic chemistry. The characters came to life and drew me right into a wonderful sensual world in New Orleans."
2,This is not a story,"It goes like this--intro to storyline, minor story detail, sex sex sex sex, story, sex times 10, you get the picture. I found myself skipping many pages just to get to the end. I appreciate a good sex scene when intertwined with a storyline but this was all sex, all the time."
5,HOT!,you'll enjoy this if you like dirty talk. ;) grab a bottle of water and some batteries with this one. very hot
4,"Very talented and underappreciated artist, David Foster","Great CD, especially The Best of Me! It is still one of ""our"" songs and also one I am singing with a friend at an upcoming friend's wedding."
5,fresh like a cold soda in the summer heat,"It's a compilation of songs performed by Milva between 1961 and 1965, which correspond to the beginnings of her 40 yrs brilliant career. It's amazing listening to the high youthful voice of this great artist singing French, Greek and certainly Italian masterpieces of the sixties or even earlier, and successes of her own as well, one of them having been composed by Ennio Morricone, well-known author of many Hollywood soundtracks."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the quality of animation in this title. Because this title is a parody of the Anime genre, the characters tend to be overly stereotyped. Not as funny as a parody should be either. The built in commercial interuptions would have worked better if they had more than just one to run. Most Americans wouldn't understand the whole ""Idol Singer"" craze, so much of what little plot there is will go right past all but the most hardcore of otaku."
3,The daytime soap version of Tolstoy.,"This tacky version of the Tolstoy tome suffers most from some inexplicably crass casting - particularly the rabbit-faced ingenue doing Natasha with wide-eyed ineptitude, and a dufus interpretation of the central philosophic, Pierre. All the characterizations are the cardboard kind of daytime TV, and director Dornhelm seems to want this to appeal to a mass audience - probably adolescents - who would never attempt to read the book. This is glossy camp and can be enjoyed on that level: an expensive, inept TV show of epic proportions.This Scandinavian, all-region blu-ray has all four parts of the mini-series on two discs, presented with an English soundtrack, with optional Danish, Swedish or Finnish subtitles. The mastering is glossy, but appears accurate and detailed. The sound is not discrete 6-track as indicated on the packaging, but is 2-track matrixed stereo which sounds clean, but dynamically flat, when played correctly in Dolby pro-logic mode."
1,War and Peace 2007 TV- Series,"Clearly this is made for popular viewing by people who have never read the book. It uses some of the basic narrative of events and characters to make a costume soap opera. It has none of the poetry, none of the philosophical musings searching for wisdom, none of the variety of characters or understanding of humanity of Tolstoy's great literary masterpiece. Even Pierre has been turned into a socially easy, seductive image for someone's erotic fantasy, with glasses the only indicator of Tolstoy's intention that he be a socially awkward, rather plump, bumbling intellectual. It has taken his beautiful novel and turned it into trash. The movie made by the Russian Bondarchuk is wonderful but in Russian and my copy is a faded 30 year old tape. I was lured into buying this version by the enthusiastic reviews above and hope this will alert others in my place."
1,DVD won't play in Blu-ray players,I've waited several years for this movie and bought it a few months ago. Sadly it won't play in any Blu-ray player I've tried to use. It just spins in the player or pops up disc menu for 2seconds and then I receive an error stating that the resolution isn't supported by my TV.
3,Does the job well ... but Sesame Lemon is a challenging flavor,"Pemmicans are not haute cuisine, nor are they candy bars disguised as nutrition bars (the flavor has a strong molasses component.) They are serious food built for a purpose: maximum food value in a compact, easy to carry package. Each provides a meal that sticks to your ribs and provides plenty of energy for a morning or afternoon of work or play.We buy them by the case... :)______________________________________Having said that, the Sesame Lemon flavor is challenging, and not for everyone. Recommend the Fruit and Nut."
2,Ho boy,"This was just plain bad. Not bad enough to give it one stars as there were a few spots where I laughed. But ugh! Trying to resurrect the Panther series with this poor excuse for a story, not a good idea. This is not worthy to have ""Pink Panther"" in the title."
2,Unworthy extension of Pink Panther franchise,"Son of the Pink Panther isn't bad, but Roberto Benigni is no Peter Sellers. I get the feeling that he's trying to be funny rather than being totally sincere in his misadventures.I can understand the desire to continue the franchise but feel that Blake Edwards should have let well enough alone when Peter Sellers passed away."
4,Astor's Millions,"Found it to be a interesting look at the man behind the millions. The main focus of the book is aimed at examining how he made his fortune, sometimes in too much detail. I was expecting to find more information on how his fortune stood in relation to the times and how he spent his money, but Astor was known more for making money, not spending it. The book is more like a study in the business of late 18th century trapping, merchant shipping and real estate than it is about Astor, but that is the underlying theme of the book as well. Astor was the biggest business man in all three areas. The story of Astor deals with wealth, politics and war and how they were all connected. Well researched book and easily read. RECOMMENDED."
3,"This book was good, at best","I bought this book to learn about Astor and how he made his fortunes. The book goes into almost too much depth in regards to the fortune made in fur trading and shipping. Out of the 25 chapters, 23 were discussing nearly every detail of Astor, his men, indians, and his competition in regards to trading and shipping. In chapter 23, the author finally gets to where he claims Astor made his largest fortune, real estate. Since that is where he made the bulk of his fortune, then why did the author only devote one chapter to this topic? Most people who buy this book will do so to learn how Astor made his fortune, that is not explained well enough. I have to give the author credit, though, he did uncover many details that the other Astor biographers failed to see."
2,Nobody is Home in Madsen's new Biography,"Perhaps I should not write a review of this book as I did not finish it. I found the subject--Astor, who he was, what he did, and how and why he did it--very interesting, but Madsen's treatment an example of biography at its worst. Why? Because we are presented with the data of Astor's life, but where is Astor? There is virtually nothing communicated as to what type of person he was, WHY he was so ambitious, what he felt and thought about the various activities he undertook, his successes, relative failures, etc. In many instances of course the available data of his life do not necessarily communicate the subjective life of the psyche, only the objective actions. But it is the very task of a biographer--in my view the most vital task--to artfully connect the various ""dots"" of data so as to reveal the subjective life within, the drama of the mind and heart reacting to events as the events unfold. You don't get that here."
3,"Excellent history of fur trade, little of Real Estate.","Madsen takes the reader through an interesting account of the early fur trade and the opening of the American West. There are interesting anecdotes from Astor's deaings with historical and political figures of the time. However, if you are looking for information on his later business dealings and the development of Astor into New York's largest property owner and landlord then you will be disappointed. Nine tenths of his book is devoted to the development of the American Fur Company and the travials of those who forged through the wild countryside on Astors behalf. There is nothing in this book about how he dealt with tenants, advertised properties, developed systems of management for properties, financing, leverage, nothing.So buy it for an interesting histort of the time but don't buy it if your looking for information on how one of the great Real Estate investors of his time developed and managed his system of success."
3,JOHN ASTOR,"AN INTERESTING BOOK, BUT VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE HUGE AMOUNT OF WORTH GENERATED BY THE REAL ESTATE OWNED BY THE ASTOR FAMILY AND THE CRATION OF THE WALDORF ASTORIA ONE OF THE FAMILY MOST FAMOUS LANDMARKS. IT DID GIVE A LOT OF INSIGHT TO AMERICAN POLITICAL LIFE IN THE EARLY 1800'S WHEN JAMES MADISON AND JAMES MONROE WERE PRESIDENTS."
4,Great vid,Awesum movie recommend to anyone who likes to know about sperm whales certainly gives me more of an insight how these great leviathians of the deep exist
3,Good Turntable,"This is a good turntable and unlike the plastic ones it looks good, too. The big problem is that it doesn't use ball bearing which means it can't handle much weight and does not turn smoothly when a heavy object is on it. I have a plastic one with ball bearings which is better in this regard. I bought it for cake decorating and seems to get the job done."
5,stainless turntable,"I recently purchased this turntable for countertop use. It holds cream, sugar, salt and pepper perfectly and turns easily on granite counters."
2,humanite missing,"This story of the murder of an 11 year old girl has all the elements, a horrible crime, the sullen, moody loner detective, the gray backdrop of northern france, conflicted sexual identity. The elements however were never really put together. The Detective broods more than detects. Is it because he is ground down by shock and tragedy, well we didn't find out. Speaking of shock, we did get quite a bit of that but one wondered if certain explicit scenes were put in for shock value alone. i.e fine acting or the Director acting out. The movie is not so disapointing that it should not be seen however. Serious fans of French cinema will want to see the film and think about what a great film it could have been."
1,The second most boring film I've ever seen,"This movie reminds me of the joke: ""How do you keep an idiot in suspense?"" And I was the idiot. I watched it right up to the end thinking that something would happen. If you like watching a man masturbate this may just be your cup of tea. There isn't any action, deep thinking, good acting, beautiful people, or much of a story in this film. And I like off-beat films. The only film that bored me more was Wings of Desire. At least that had some nice pictures of old Berlin.Is there some number of stars less than 1 which I can give it?"
1,Undeserving of any stars!,"This is the most boring film it has ever been my misfortune to endure. The film is over two hours of nothing. The actors are not allowed to act even though the story could have been most exciting and would have been in the hands of another director. This director is just plain awful--he makes his actors behave woodenly, and his camerawork is dull, dreary, and tedious. There is absolutely nothing to recommend this film. Why the Cannes film festival gave it all sorts of prizes is beyond comprehension and belief. Don't bother to rent it and most assuredly, don't buy it. Almost any other film is worth your time and money -- not this one."
1,Stay Away from this movie,"This movie involves child-rape, and opens with a shot of multilated female genitalia. And to make matters worse, it is boring. Avoid at all costs."
2,Don't Judge a Book by Its Title,"This book talks little about archaeology and when it does, the interpretation is poor at best. The author is very repetitive with the few sources he has. Despite the lack of a credible discussion of social space, the book is well written and easily read."
1,BORING ! I,I am a fan of pet psychic books. The writing format will put you to sleep I guarantee ! This one is already in my recycling bin.
1,a crushing disappointment,"As an adoring devotee of the Maggody series, I was truly disappointed in the latest saga of the delightful folks of Maggody. Ms. Hess has entertained me with names of the Buchanon tribe, antics of Ruby Bee and Estelle, etc. so much that I have read each book three times. Her character development is so precise that I would recognize any citizen of Maggody if I met him/her on the streets of Moscow. There were too many dangling plot threads in ""misery"" (perhaps to be developed in future books?). My friends and I agree that although this book didn't made the grade, Ms. Hess's track record is still unsurpassed by anyone. Surely in the crown jewels of England there is one tiny rhinestone!"
3,not her best but still worth reading,"A friend found an autographed copy of this book and gave it to me for a housewarming gift. I waited until I was moved in and dug into the first page. I live 15 miles south of Memphis, and I just knew this book would ""knock my socks off."" Like several others, I was disappointed in this latest Arly mystery. Perhaps the Maggody books are best when set in Maggody with its familiar, quirky residents. I still had some laughs and was interested in the plot and new characters, but this would not rate as the best in the series. Joan Hess, however, on her worst day tops many of the rest. I love the Maggody residents better than I love my own kin, and the townspeople of Maggody are much more entertaining!"
2,"A good effort, but limited","Although I applaud Jill Krementz in her effort to give voice to adopted children, I found this book limited and limiting. The over-emphasis on white children and on search and reunion is both misleading and unhelpful. For a young child unwilling or unable to find birthparents, the focus (as is so often the case in media) on reunions raises troubling questions of their own life. Although there are four African-American children, there is only one Asian child--even though Korea alone is responsible for roughly 100,000 adoptions to U.S. families. I would prefer that this book had been titled, ""How it feels to be white adopted."""
2,Not as good as it sounds,I was unaware this book was nothing but a compilation of adopted children's statements. I thought it would be more about the psychology of the adoptee.
3,good deal,this was a good deal on price but could be more colorful.( maybe in black) but i was happy with the prouduct.
3,It's Okay,"Overall this series is okay. I bought this DVD to show my ""B"" level World History students. They were totally lost. The music was a bit loud and the audio was a bit too soft. It moved rather quickly which made it even harder for them to follow. This series is good for the teacher to watch, but it is a bit too thick for freshmen. I also recommend it for European AP students and college students taking European History."
2,Horrid and cheesy,"These just the facts videos are wretched and will, if used in a classroom setting, put your students to sleep. My AP European history students were actually laughing at it with me, right down to the American country music style rendition of Amazing Grace when discussing Lutheranism?! LAME ""Just the Facts"" = FAIL. The only reason it gets two start is that it didn't have factual errors and *could* be used as supplement to the time period if you are completely desperate."
5,Beautiful and delicate playing,"I was extremely surprised to find this naxos guitar recital CD that actually had good playing on it. Montesinos plays with an incredible state of maturity and poise for a 20yr old girl. She isn't afraid to be free with the tempi, which is a nice change from all of these players who play romantic with a stick up their ass. Montesinos however, has chosen great romantic music that is not the standard rep that any softball performer would choose. Even her caprichio arabe is beautifully played and has the same mystery to it, though I have heard it a billion times. It is relieving to hear a competition winner that doesn't sound like the boring, mechanical Azabagic-like guitarist. Overall, incredibly beautiful."
5,This book was so good my writing mentors use it.,I have read many books on this topic and none of them held my attention and spoke a language that I could understand like this one. The issues addressed are all current depsite the age of the original publication of this book. I tried to highlight the relevant portions of the text and found my entire book highlighted. Every word is valuable. I feel my writing has improved tremendously since reading this book and applying it's notions to my writing! A retired editor and writer friend of mine recently revealed her use of this book in helping her prepare her ideas and develop them into succssful stories. I could not recommend a book more if you want to write for children.
5,Can't put the book down,"It gets better. Brenda Joyce did a great job in the newest release of the Deadly series. I just cannot put the book down and I am thrilled at the development of the relationship between Hart and Fran. Another great part is that the author keeps you guessing because she plants some doubts on Hart's devotion to Fran as he is such a rake. Bragg is such a weakling by accepting his wife's Leigh Anne's return. Meanwhile, the murders keeps the novel exciting and and I really find this a perfect blend between romance and murder!Cannot wait for the next book of the series to come out in Fall."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!,"I am an avid reader, and absolutely love the Deadly Series by Brenda Joyce. I sat down and read this book from start to finish. I could not get enough. I love all the characters and I love the relationship between Francesca and Hart. I can hardly wait until the next book is released. Brenda Joyce is excellent! I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good love story, a lot of drama, and lots of laughs."
5,Great Book!!!!,I can't wait for Brenda Joyce to come out with another one after Deadly Promise. I have read all of the deadly series and I cannot get enough. I hope the next book comes out soon!
4,MUCH better this time...,"I seriously comtemplated not buying this book. The last book in the Deadly series was...well, deadly. I went ahead and tried this one and luckily I liked it very much. I appreciated that there was much more passion and some adult emotions. The last book the heroine was so silly I just couldn't believe anyone would love her at all. It's also hard to buy why Bragg keeps calling her to help him with cases. Does she really help or just get in the way and ends up needing to be rescued? I liked the romance between Fran and Hart, but I liked Bragg better in the beginning. Everything keeps changing and that's OK, but sometimes it's just frustrating."
3,DEADLY CARESS A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I was eager to read this when I first got it, but the further I got in the book, the more disturbed I got. I liked all of the previous deadly books, but this one doesn't get my vote. I think that bringing back Leign Ann was a mistake and that only complicates this story. Bragg shouldn't have let her win, and frankly, he was too weak, and he succumbed to her will. I think that if this story was to come out with a good ending, Francesca would have to find another man and leave Bragg and Hart behind, because they have too many problems. At this rate, this series will go on forever and I just can't picture a good ending to all the mess Joyce created. Never mind that though, I will be back in the fall to read the next one in the series, but I sincerely hope it's better than this one, or I may just stop reading this series. That's not too likely though, for one thing is true, the series is captivating and you'll catch on to it quickly."
3,Whew! This isn't your Mother's Nancy Drew book,Murder mystery and sex..you gotta love it. This was a well written murder mystery that kept you guess until the end. The love triangle between the two brothers and Francesca is getting hotter if possible! At this point I don't know which brother I am cheering for!?!? and the ending is not to be believed! If this is the first book you pick up in the series you won't be lost but do yourself a favor and read the first 2 books.
3,Good diagrams and rebuilding info but not much troubleshooti,"Good diagrams and rebuilding information but a little light on troubleshootin, diagnostics, and tuning."
3,Covers too much ground??,"Just about any Weber carb is in this book, plus Zenith Strombergs and SU carburetors ... with four or five pages dedicated to each. In other words, a mile wide and an inch deep. But where else can you find this much information between two covers? Just a shame it's published on newsprint paper...pj"
1,Not up to date for Z-S carbs.,"If you have Zenith-Strombergs and need info this book is ONLY good up to 1974, there are no carb or metering needle part numbers, or any reference numbers after 1974, it's not in this book, even though it was printed in 1995."
3,Misleading but well written.,"I made the mistake of reading this book while my daughter (born 15 1/2 weeks early) was still early in her hospital stay. Ms. Mehren, as a NICU mom herself, really helped me come to terms and put words to some of my feelings. The big warning I think is needed is for parents who are in the middle of (or the beginning) their NICU experience. Why? The book cover talks of ""one infants extraordinary fight to survive"" and ""miracles"". Nothing to prepare you for the unhappy ending. I found out,and read it anyway, but forewarned is forearmed."
5,Excellent,This book is both true to life and intriguing. Emily and her mother's experience in the NICU was scary but also prepares a mom-to-be with the reality that your baby might have to face this situation. All around a great book.
4,An Absolutely Wonderful Book!,"I was introduced to this book many years ago when it was featured in the book section of Reader's Digest. I've since read the complete book and found it to be one of the best books that I've read regarding premature birth. I am now reading Elizabeth Mehren's follow-up book to ""Born Too Soon"" titled ""After the Darkest Hour, the Sun Will Shine Again: A Parents Guide to Coping With the Loss of a Child"".Katie UdellExecutive Director of ResearchThe Alexis Foundation for Premature Infants and Children"
5,This is probably the best Jamal recording.,"Tthis disc sizzles for one reason: Herlin Riley, the drummer. Jamal flies, he soars across the keyboard, across modalities and changes like few others, but unlike some other discs, Riley, along with the solid, if sweating, James Cammack, on bass, provides a solid launch pad. Get it, listen, and wonder why this trio hasn't made more discs."
5,Very strong,This is certainly one of the great jazz albums of the eighties. I have been listening to it for almost twenty years and never got tired of. Listen to Without You or Yellow Fellow to get a good idea of what this trio was capable of: Such a powerful drive from bass and drums makes Jamal fly - how great!
3,Purchased as gift,"purchased this as a gift for my mother. She had one for years until it finally gave out, she was devastated, she used it a lot and loved it. If this one is anything like the first one, it's a great tool according to my mom."
5,New design same functions,"I've had a Salad Shooter in my home for 20yrs. This is the 3rd one I've had to buy.I don't use it every day, but at the end of Summer I break it out to prep veggies for the freezer for fast soups. So I was more than a little upset to find my old one died on me. Even more upset by the fact I could not find this appliance in any local stores (Walmart, Target, Kmart), not even on their webpages!Only the blades of my old one fits this newer design."
3,good price,"I had a salad shooter for years and wore it out, this one is nice but when I listen to the motor change tones as it is shredding weggies it is not as powerful as my old one, but it is still good"
5,"The only thing we use this for is grated cheese, and it's still worth it.","I can grate a brick of cheese and save it in tupper ware in about 2 minutes. Then all week it's ready for quesadilla's, chilli, or anything else we need it for. It's not any harder to clean than a normal cheese grater (just don't put it in the bottom rack of the dishwasher, it may warp)."
5,It Works!,"Why it took me so long to purchase one of the Salad Shooters is beyond me. Maybe it's due to the fact that I got used to using the old hand grater for cheeses. With the onset of arthritis in the hands I searched the reviews to see which new kitchen gadget would get my money, this one was it. Like another reviewer, I cannot even fathom how much cheese I have grated with it but it's unstoppable and saves my hands the pain and grief of the hand held grater! It won't chop or dice (that's another gadget) but the price (to me) is truly worth the time it saves me in the kitchen. Noisy? That it is but really to me it's a small price to pay for the convenience of it. Some bits of cheese don't get grated (sticks to the inside of the unit) but that is very minimal. Cleaning the parts is also easy."
5,Salad Shooter Review,This product works great and is a big help in the kitchen. I use it for grating cheese and it saves a lot of time.. I would recommend it to others.
4,Christmas gift 2012,I have had my SaladShooter for many years. My daugher-in-law liked the way my cheeses and other condements were shredded for salads and other receipes. I gave her one for Christmas 2012. I know she too has now enjoyed using this product as much as I do. Clean up is so easy.
4,Good purchase,"After slicing 2 fingers on my hand on a mandoline slicer, I purchased this to protect my remaining fingers. I like it. It does the job as advertised. I just sometimes find it easier to use a knife than to get it out, set it up, take it apart and wash it all up. I wish I had bought the delux model that had more cone options. The slices are a little thin but it does a very good job and when I have company and need a large amount of things cut up, I use it. I've sliced cukes, carrots and shredded an orange for a cooking receipe. The clean up is easy and the parts come apart and go together with ease. Haven't put it in the dishwasher but it does say it is safe to do so. It was a good purchase."
4,"Is what it is, does what it does, buy it now.","Not the most expensive kitchen gadget you can buy, but probably the most fun to use. Does what the big food processors do, only smaller and easier to clean. A little loud, but what gadget like this isn't. Get it, and have carrot fights with the neighbor over your fence. On Guard!"
4,I like it,It's my second one and I really like it. I bought the fisrt one 15 years ago and that one is as good.
4,Can't believe I've used it for 10 years already!,"I received this little gadget as a wedding shower gift in 1992. At first I thought I would NEVER use it. Then one day I used it to shred mozzarella cheese (I was making lasagna). Now it's 10 years later and I'm still using it for the same purpose. The shredding cone is wearing out and has a small crack in it, so I'm going to order a replacement part (which I think is a bit overpriced - from what I've seen on the internet so far). It's a bit tricky to clean by hand, but comes out squeaky clean in the dishwasher. Once I tried shredding lettuce with it, but it did not work out as neatly as the cheese. I would say it's a handy tool for the kitchen and I would purchase one as a gift for a new bride or any amateur cook who enjoys new gadgets."
4,Mostly just love it,I love the way it works and cleans up. The only complaint I have is the ruggedness of the blade assembly. Our shredder broke right away.
2,Defective parts,Product was very difficult to assemble. (At least this particular one). Parts did not assemble securely. Would come apart during use.Previously owned Salad Shooter was easier to assemble and parts remained secure during use.
3,New presto salad shooter,"I really like the salad shooter, I've owned one for over 15 years. My old one (model #0291001) did need some electical tweaking in the switch after about 2 years, which was an easy fix. I liked the detachable cord, which is not on the newer model (#0291004). The reason I had to buy the new model was because the grater attachment broke and it was more economical to buy a new one than a replacement.Now the new model stands taller than the old one and now won't fit upright in my cabinet (7 7/8 compared to 8 3/4). If they could squeeze in another 1/4 inch on the hopper in order to accomodate a standard 8 oz block of cheese I would buy another one. Oh. this is a little quieter than the previous one."
5,Presto Salad Shooter,"I gave this as a gift, cause I have one that I have had for 10 years and love it."
4,Handy little Product!,"I bought this product a couple of weeks before. It arrived on time. I Love it. It does the job of shredding carrots,radish,cauliflower and coconut perfectly!! Its just enough for day to day shredding needs. Cleaning is easy as all parts are detachable. I hate to take of my big food processor and use it for just one or 2 carrots!!thats why i call this handy little machine.Makes a bit more noise! but i can live with that..thanks"
3,Fair,"I needed a food processor for small jobs and wanted to try the salad shooter. I've had mixed results so far. It did fine with carrots and cabbage but when I tried to grate onion, the process clogged and stopped working. I removed the onion and repositioned it without success. I'm not sure what the problem was, maybe because the onion was slippery and the grater just couldn't make good contact."
5,This gadget is great.,"This thing is great. I use it to shred potatoes, cheese, carrots, etc. It works like a charm and puts the produce right where you want it - right in the bowl or the hot pan. It's a lot safer than a mandoline slicer. Clean up is really a breeze. I've used mine for years and I'd never be without one. I hope they never stop making them. You should get one."
5,Salad Shooter,I love big raw salads and the salad shooter helps me make them quickly. I also use it for making zucchini bread and so many other things.
2,MUCH Smaller than it looks in the picture,"I bought one of these to replace my dying Chip Shot (older model Presto SaladShooter). However, this one is tiny by comparison, and won't even fit a regular-sized potato in without cutting it into pieces. Very under powered for my needs. Luckily we recently upgraded to a good food processor, so I can cut my potatoes and shred my cheese much more easily. Would definitely not buy again."
2,Should have more attachments for this price.,"The Presto Saladshooter works well and cleans easily. I'm only giving it a ""2"" because you have to buy more attachments that should have come with it at that price. Also the low rating is deserved because it is made in China, and I'm sick to death of almost everything being made in China. We desperately need jobs in America, but the manufacturers are too cheap to pay decent wages and benefits to Americans.As is, this machine only slices and shreds in one size each. It should have been designed to aim the foods straight into the bowl or pan without making you buy a separate attachment. Also, I prefer finer size shreds for most foods, and would have to buy the fine-shred attachment for that. I've seen manual machines that produce more shapes and sizes at much lower costs. My arm won't fall off if I turn a crank or slide a lever to achieve the results I want - instead of wasting electricity."
1,Horrible,What a piece of junk!This thing BARELY works.... I have to RAM cabbage through with all my might.It literally doesn't work...What a huge waste of time.
2,Salad Shooter,"Had to return this item as I ordered the wrong one. I have this one, but since I do heavy duty large portions of scalloped potatoes and zucchini casseroles to take to pot lucks and family gatherings, I needed the larger professional one. I was borrowing my neighbor's to be able to make perfect slices of five pounds of potatoes in just minutes.Thanks for the ease of returning my mistake and being able to replace it with the one I wanted."
2,Presto 02910 salad shooter electric slicer/shredder,"The machine seems to work but it was designed for the American 130 volt mains system with their flat pin design.I have already pointed out that a robust voltage reducer for the 230 U.K. would needed to avoid burn out.The postage and customs fee was pretty high.My feeling is that there must be a different British option (although everything seems to be imported from China anyway).If the company hopes to sell on the British market (or some European markets), it must provide a 13 amp plug and address the voltage difference as a top priority.David Morris"
1,It did not work for me.,"I purchased this item but It did not work for me, it's poorly constructed and too flimsy so I gave it away."
1,Would not buy again,I have had one of these for 8 years and loved it. The new one is half the size and is not big enough for a whole potato. How are you to make pretty potato dishes when you have to cut them in half or more. it is way to small. Bring the old one back please. Nancy
5,I love it,I love it very much. It is very easy to use. I will recommend to everybody to buy it and use it. I got 2 of them one for me and second one for my sister.
3,Works great,Works great but not as well made as older models. Plastic seems cheaper and motor a little bit weaker. Good overall.
4,Presto 02910 SaladShooter,"Convenient, easy to use and clean. Great for shredding ingredients for salads and fried rice without having to lug out the food processesor. Some pieces are left over in the shredder, but they can easily be hand-cut. This is true for food processors as well, so I'm not bothered by this."
3,Small Salad Shooter,"I love my old salad shooter but I guess they made a much smaller one this time. I must have ordered the smallest shooter they make, however other than having to cut up the veggies before putting them in the tube, it works just fine."
1,not what I expected,"I bought this to shred cabbage. It does an extremely poor job, turns cabbage to mush. Very disappointed. I would not recommend this product."
5,Perfect fit !,This is exactly what I needed to replace a lost lens on my 5th Wheel. Perfect fit/exact match to all the other lens.
5,Vale la pena leerlo.,"Un interesante acercamiento a los eternos opuestos. Es el bien algo absoluto? y el mal?. Es Pascual Duarte el verdugo o es la víctima?Es un libro para ser leído al menos dos veces, la primera para disfrutarlo y la segunda o subsecuentes para ser analizado. Así que, si tu intención es el disfrute, aquí tienes algo para disfrutar. Si te interesa el análisis literario, psicológico o sociológico, también lo encuentras en esta obra de Don Camilo."
4,Great read,I read this book in monthly book club meeting. Prior to attending the meeting I was less than enthused about it. The book discussion leader that night brought the book to life for me. You need knowledge of post civil war Spain to relate this book to actual events.[...]
1,stil waiting,"Hi there...i am still waiting for the item I ordered...said that will arrived the 18th of november, can somebody direct me to the rigth dpto??Thank you"
3,Good mixer but noisy,"I bought this item from a local store and it does a very nice job but is very noisy. On the lowest or highest speed it sounds fine but the in between speeds (around 2-4) are extremely loud and have a high pitched whine. Also, the burst of speed is pretty usless and it is quite heavy. If I had it to do over I would have purchased a smaller less powerful model in hopes that that would cure the noisiness."
5,Theology: The Basics,I used this book for one of the courses in my Masters program and have used it many times since then as a resource. I have used it for myself as well as to answer questions for our RCIA group. I have recommended this book to fellow team members at our parish.McGrath's use of the Apostle's Creed as the model for the progression of the chapters fits in well with learning about God and our beliefs. I also liked cross referencing with the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
5,Very Good Information,"It is an excellent resource to have. Its information is written in a subjective and concise manner, an excellent educational tool."
1,CAN YOU SAY ALIEN,UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYUGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYUGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYUGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYUGLY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I Like Bratz But This Is You Geussed It UGLY
1,no,"Hello, my name is Alexandrea Marie Anna Bunitorisua and i am reviewing ""Yasmin"". I think that this doll is very ugly and wrong. What are toys trying to teach children these days?!? That it is fine to graduate schools? Girls should stay home and help their mothers until they are four teen, and then they get married and have children at fifteen. These dolls are very bad for young girls because they make it seem like girls can particapate in sports, which they cannot. That is my opinion and i hope you follow by it. its true!"
2,SKA FANS BEWARE!!,"This CD IS NOT by the awesome New Jersey ska band ""Catch 22."" THIS IS NOT SKA!! What this CD really is is a couple of German guys spinning some techno/dance music, and as far as I can tell has nothing to do with what some ska fans might be hoping for."
4,cool,"i liked this dvd, very informative, it is basically a history lesson and looks like an old school history channel documentary, may put you to sleep, about an hour long"
4,Undeservedly neglected,There certainly are some gorgeous moments in the first two movements of the third symphony. If the final movement sounds a bit too much like Copland one can say that of so many composers. I heartily recommend these enjoyable works. Definitely worthwhile listening.
2,"Nice plot, no atmosphere.","While the author is doing a good job in showing us how a victim might have been a victor but for his choice of assassin, the book is deficient in most other aspects. The portrait of Alexander is a bit pale, I found several anachronisms and other mistakes (e.g. the idea that parchment and papyrus are the same thing), the characters are too much 20th century, and the story is strangely lacking in mediterranean atmosphere. Did the author (who, of course, is not really named Anna Apostolou) ever visit Greece, I wonder?"
3,"Interesting premise, unfortunately it's not a very good read","I sat down and read the majority of this book on a beach in Greece, and I'd have to say that one of this book's major failings is its inability to capture the atmosphere of that land. The assasination of Phillip does make for an intriguing topic in historical fiction, however this novels starts off well but then proceeds to bumble through a muddy plotline with thinly sketched characters. Thankfully, I had plenty of Robert Graves and Steven Saylor as well as non-fiction history books to accompany me for the rest of my time in Greece. I'd love to see someone do really written and entertaining historical fiction set in the ancient Greek world."
3,Nice book- Historical Mistakes,"Excellent script, thought many important historical mistakes... Alexander the Great, for example, the Greek victorious army commander, is not described as he really was..."
4,Certainly could have been worse.,"This is a good, quick read. Paul Doherty, writing as Apostolou, keeps the story moving well. The reason for only four stars is that it's not historically accurate enough, so there are points that you will laugh at if you know Alexander.All-in-all, a pretty good historical mystery."
4,Fascinating review history,"I've seen Phillip's tomb, and early next year I'm starting in Thessaloniki and following Alexander's trail through parts of Turkey. So, I'm reading everything I can get hold of on Alexander. I enjoyed both Alexander books by Apostolou. I also read the two Alexander books by P.C. Doherty. I noticed some of the language in the two series's is the same. I've never come across the phrase, ""He pulled a face"" before, so I speculated they were the same author. It turns out, that's true.There have been a couple of negative reviews here from people insisting on historical accuracy and pointing out alleged flaws. OK. That's their right. Interestingly, the reviews on the Doherty side of the house are almost universally rave reviews.Fascinating."
2,"Interesting topic, questionable characterizations","This book deals with one of the great mysteries in history - who killed Philip II, father of Alexander the Great. My biggest complaint with this novel is the author's note. The author states that Alexander's character is very much as found in the historical documents; ""rather shy, self-effacing, suffering from panic attacks, and very shy of women."" Not quite. Every ancient source portrays him as gregarious, prone to excessive ego and ambition, incredibly bold and often reckless. There is no indication he was shy around women, rather that he was somewhat disinterested in them sexually until his mid-20's. Alexander had conquered the known world by his 30th birthday, and one has to question the author's opinion of his character.For those who wish to make up their minds for themselves about Alexander's character, I recommend A.B. Bosworth's excellent, ""Conquest and Empire, the Reign of Alexander the Great,"" available, of course, from Amazon.com."
4,Cool Toy!,"to the ""concerned parent"" who wrote: This toy is promoting sleazey make-up and tattoos.... I have to disagree with you. Now a days you go to the Dr. office and after a shot they offer kids a sticker or a temporary tattoo. This parent probably never even bought this toy so who is he/she to write a review on it. If you don't like don't buy it! This is a beautiful doll and your little one will totally enjoy it! She's wonderful! You gotta love Bratz and if you don't don't buy them and don't leave a negative review specially if you didn't even buy the toy!"
4,james last live atthe royal albert,Liked the music ...maybe a little bit too much leaning toward jazz...rather than typical james last
2,"recording quality not good, songs performance and selection is great","recording quality not good, songs performance and selection is great, James last is a timeless performer, need up to date technology to record on this dvd"
2,one-side of the story,"This is an interesting interpretation of the events that surrounded the revealing of ritual abuse claims in daycare settings. However well-intentioned the book may be though, it is only an interpretation and it discounts other evidence that illustrates that ritual abuse is indeed a real phenomena. There are also many other books on the topic (such as Cults that Kill; and Ritual Abuse by Margaret Smith) that tell the other side of the story. As hard as it is to believe, some religious cults can and do at times abuse children as part of their rituals. I know because it happened to me."
1,A product of the backlash against survivors.,"This book is not only onesided, it will also , I believe, harm the cause of those who were victimized by ritual crime. It ignores the 'hard' evidence that does exist for the existence of ritual abuse, and dismisses the potential truth of the testimony of individual survivors. The authors could have balanced their skepticism with the evidence and testimony for the 'other side' regarding the reality of ritual abuse. Instead they chose to ignore it. The title says it all. Unfortunately, though, I think the 'witches' of historic Salem have more in common with those who have been tortured in ritual abuse...in both situations, their innocence is not believed and their persecution is justified by the ignorant and the perpetrators."
1,An invitation to pedophiles,This book completely abandons the true victims of Ritual Abuse in favor of pedophiles and other child abusers. It is a perfect example of the thinking behind the continued horrific abuse of children in this country.
5,This Is A Must Read For Those Interested In The Subject,This book is great. It will make even the most ardent believers of SRA[Satanic Ritual Abuse] have seconde thoughts. The research is complete and very informative.
1,No Trays,"I didn't get the 3 D.I.Y. trays. There was an extra instructions booklet (for Dentists) that had two sheets of wax tucked in it, but no trays at all. So I have to give this a single star right, as it does me no good."
3,Missing one of the trays,"I just received my package last night and it only came with two DIY trays, not the 3 in the product description. Also, there aren't any instructions included with the order on how to customize the trays to fit in your mouth, so it looks like I will have to look online on how to do it. I ordered this same product from another seller on Amazon a week ago and ended up having to return it because the DIY trays were completely missing. At least this seller does include the trays. I haven't tried the product yet, but it looks like the same exact stuff I get from my dentist, so I'm sure it will be fine."
4,Stand by Me,I was searching for a copy of one of the songs on this album and I wasn't disappointed because it was even better than the original that I remeber.
2,Biggest ripoff ever,I know this CD was released long ago but I am shocked by all the good to great reviews it gets. I have this CD and while every song is very good I can not recommend a CD with ten tracks that clocks in at under 24 minutes. I thought my CD player was broken when i first saw the length of the whole CD. Somebody should re-release this soundtrack and add about 15 more songs to it.
5,A crazed fan from Minnesota,"This is a great movie, which makes it a great soundtrack. If you liked the movie, you'll definitely like the music!"
2,O.K. but there is better for less money,"If your looking for meditation cd's to help you on your path there are many others available for a much lower price. Although I found these meditations O.K. They are not worth the big price tag in my opinion. All the hype with the movie ""the secret"" (highly recommended) has allwed for the meditation hype with this product. If you want meditation cd's try looking up Nithyananda. Much better and your getting the real thing from an enlightened Master. I don't want to say anything bad about the author of this material as everyone is doing good things but the price tag is way too high."
5,Simply the Best cookbook Ever,"I received ""Great American Favorite Brand Name Cookbook, Collector's Edition"" as a gift in 1994. I own over 100 cookbooks & always go back to this one. Not only is it the best, it's the prettiest. I can't imagine what Dilbeck was thinking with that review. I wish these were still in print so I could purchase them as gifts for others.Great American Favorite Brand Name Cookbook, Collector's Edition"
1,"a fun read, but not practical for cooking everyday.","The book is a fun read. Not something I would use as a reference for everyday cooking. Most of the recipes are from the player's famous Chefs and gourmet restaurants. Not something that the everyday cook would use. I only found around 3 recipes in the whole book that I would make. The rest of the recipes are a bit too fancy for our family: using duck, goat cheeses, etc. It makes a nice addition to my cookbook collection, but it's not one that I will use for cooking."
4,A delightful series of short performances by a master of the art,"Adachi is best known for his long-form sports-centered works like Touch or Cross Game, but here he shows his skill in short pieces as well. Some of the stories are comedic, some more thoughtful, one relatively dark in implication; some are more fantastical while others are more realistic; but all are light-hearted and playful and possessed of a nice slice-of-life feel.While I haven't given it five stars out of a personal tendency to hold back from extremes, if the system allowed I'd have gone higher, to 4.5 perhaps. I recommend this book to anyone interested."
3,Mind boggling and informational!,"TALKING PEACE is an astounding eye opening book. The facts are gripping but also upsetting. What Jimmy Carter does for human rights is phenomenal. After reading this book I have come to respect Mr. Carter and truly admire his efforts. The Carter Center, started by Jimmy Carter, has saved lives, stopped wars, and helped increase awareness of human rights all over the world. Thank you, Mr. Carter."
3,Talkin Peace,Talking Peace is a motivating book on the world's need for peace. Jimmy Carter reviews his accomplishments of starting and helping with community programs. Jimmy Carter has helped many people builds homes by supporting Habitat For Hummanity. By writing this book Carter hopes to provoke a desire in the youth of America to create a peaceful environment in which to live.
4,Talking Peace,"Talking Peace was a very informative book that opened my eyes to the unseen levels of government. Jimmy Carter is a great man who presents great principles and thoughts. His compassion for people is shown through his many deeds and works he orchestrates, such as the Atlanta Project. Overall, this book was a great, easy read with many attention grabbers that kept me interested such as the stories about government officials that one would never believe. Out of five stars, I give Jimmy Carter's Talking Peace 3 1/2 stars."
3,informative,"Jimmy Carter is able to bring the world's current issues to the youth of America in Talking Peace. His smooth flowing, usage of word is simple to comprehend and easy to follow. As Carter writes he pulls from his own experience and does not lead the reader on that the topics being discussed are not acheivable. He is helping countries all over the world with personal contributions and foundations set up by him and his wife. The issues that confront people of the world today are not passive and demand attention. Carter suggests, ""Talking Peace"" will ease the strain and will produce answers and solutions."
3,So much to know!,"TALKING PEACE by Jimmy Carter is motivating and encouraging. Through the Carter Center he has done so much for world peace and humanity in general, and has made the world a better place because of it. For example, he has worked hard to make several deadly dieases uncommon and to vaccinate children against them. Polio, tetnus, and typhus are three he, along with the Carter Center, has reduced in Africa. This book encourages all generations because so many people shout doom, and at least one person out there is working to make the world a little better. He motivates all to be responsible and do their part to make this earth a better place to live."
1,"DON'T READ THIS BOOK, OR YOU WILL DIE OF BORDUM (LITERALY)","I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT ZERO STARS BUT THAT WASN'T A OPTION. THIS THE WORST MOST BORING BOOK I'VE READ. (AND I'VE READ SOME BORING BOOKS). IF YOU READ THIS BOOK AND DIE OF BORDUM, DON'T BLAME ME, ALL I CAN SAY IS,,,,,,I WARNED YOU!!!!!!"
3,misleading,"With this artist's name on the cover I was expecting really great and creative projects, like the ones this talented bead artist is known for. Her work is both technically and visually beautiful. I do agree with the other reviews, that the book is filled with great historical information on beading but even the beads on both the front and back covers are not even included in the book, I think that is a little misleading.I was expecting this book to be filled with Ms. Hector's designs not other bead artists projects.If you want a great history lesson on beading, this is the book for you but if you want Valerie Hector's designs, you will be dissapointed."
5,"Worth buying - ""tome"" is packed solid with great info","So far I've only had the time to quickly glance through this book - it is packed with so much wonderful information that one definitely needs a good block of time to read it all.I am amazed at the wonderful charts - detailed to the bead number and threading. All of the detailed background info, charts that are truly worthwhile, and ideas - are sensibly edited and really gives one ""bang for the buck"" for this book.It took a long time for this book to be released but very much worth the wait. I recommend getting it NOW! as the artist's site indicates the first edition has sold out."
4,Good Beading History,"I was a little disappointed because I thought the book would have gobs of patterns for the beaded beads on the cover. Not so. However, it's a wonderful beadwork history book or reference bead book to see how beading has transpired through the ages."
4,"The Art of Beadwork: Historic Inspiration, Contemporary Design","This is an interesting book, filled with history about beading. I do wish Ms Hector had given specific instructions for her ""big bead"" Japanese beads (shown on the back of the book)."
2,Complete lack of interest,"My cats (both very playful) will absolutely not scratch this thing, even if I cover it in catnip. I'm giving it 3 stars because it arrived on time and is as advertised, it's just useless in my house.ETA I'm taking away a star because my cats figured out how to use it as a door knocker and it makes me nearly jump out of my skin. Useless AND annoying."
2,Useless,The carpet on this is really short and the strip overall is too narrow. I tried hanging it on several doorknobs and even anchoring it on the floor to no avail.
4,"looks good, cat won't use","It is somewhat pricey considering shipment, anyway my can does not use it as intended, she likes it when flat on the floor!"
3,carpet remnant on a rope,"It's a small piece of carpet remnant on a rope. It smells like new carpet, too, and not like it's ""catnip treated."" I am a little disappointed. My cats are not impressed, but they have used it a couple of times."
3,Older Cats Owner,"Ok, for the price it is ok. Very low pile carpet glued to a cardboard backing, but the cats do use it! They prefer another one I got that is more expensive with rope too. I lay these on the floor and they use them with no problems versus hanging from a door knob."
3,"Small and light, so beware it swinging.","You get what you pay for on this.It's a solid 3 star item.It's much shorter than normal hanging cat scratching things and much lighter. It doesn't have a dual side, but the carpet that it's made out of it pretty solid.If you want to think what it's like, think of a piece of very flat, tight weave rug (not the shaggy stuff you'd see on cat scratching posts or the 'trees') backed with a thin cardboard piece. It's a cheap fix and if your cat is a hardcore scratcher, it'll get ripped off the doorhandle in no time, or the cat will be making it fly up and from side to side.I triple looped it up on a doorhandle and actually set it on top of one of my larger hanging scratchers that the cat had already destroyed and it works 'okay'... the cat definitely prefers something with a bit more substance, the weave is so tight it doesn't give a great catch on the claws."
3,HANGING SCRATCH PAD,THIS IS A CHEAPO SCRATCH PAD. IT CAME DIFFERENT THAN THE PICTURE SHOWS. THE ONE I RECEIVED WAS LIKE A PIECE OF CARPET GLUED TO A PIECE OF CARDBOARD THAT WAS STARTING TO UNRAVEL ON THE END. I ONLY PAID $4.99 SO I GUESS ITS OKAY. COULD HAVE BOUGHT A BETTER QUALITY ONE AT WALMART FOR THE SAME PRICE??
2,coffee percolator,this item was returned! coffee capacity was too small! takes special filters and not what i thought it should be!
2,whats that noise,i baught the presto 12 c and thought i was getting a quality product. when i made my first pot during the brewing process i was hearing a loud rapping/clanking sound that was not the normal soft gergaling noises that you would expect from a perc coffee maker. this noise was intermittent not constant but was distracting none the less. i emailed presto and described the problem and they replyed that i didnt have the stem seated properly. well you can only seat the stem so far and thats it. i sent the product back to presto and they sent me a new unit with the same result. you might say i'm making much ado about nothing but this clanking noise was very distracting to me and i have to say it is a design flaw that was excceptable to presto. if you dont mind a noisy clanking coffee maker that makes decent coffee than the presto 12 c perculator is for you but not for me//tz
1,This Coffeemaker made strong tea,"We love our coffee strong, quite strong as a matter of fact and this coffeemaker could not do it. We filled the basket to the brim with coffee and it came out as strong tea. This did not work for us so back to drip we go."
3,"A reliable, cleanable maker of mediocre coffee","It's not Presto's fault that percolated coffee, no matter how much you pack into the basket, is watery and flavorless. The water comes through simply too hot because it has to boil. This burns out the oils of the coffee and waters it. We have been wanting to get away from coffee makers that have plastic conduits and containers, because the plastic decays rapidly and the coffee declines. We've often used Chemex because water under boiling temperature drips through and produces incredibly good coffee. But who wants to stand at the counter for 10 minutes, gradually adding water to a Chemex coffee maker? Worse, there is no way to keep Chemex coffee warm. In the meantime, Presto's coffee maker is 1960's technology still of good quality, if you don't really care for coffee; or if you like Starbucks-level bitter, burned robusta coffee."
1,Poor quality control on Amazons part.,"(The rating of this review reflects Amazon not the quality of the coffeemaker.)I received a broken product.The bottom plastic had a 2 inch chunk broken out of it.The Amazon packing looked totally fine. It is clear to me that Amazon failed to inspect the item before packing it. I am sure that if they had opened up the package before packing it in Amazon packaging they would have seen the break.In addition the manufactures packaging looked old, like it was past overstock.Finally the package was delayed multiple times. I had to wait about 2 weeks for a package that I expected to recive in a few days.I am very disappointed in Amazon."
5,Great Coffeemaker,The Coffeemaker makes great coffee and is made of very high quality stainless steel. Love it.
3,The coffee basket could be larger,"The price was great, it makes a very hot cup of coffee. The light comes on when the coffee is finished. The only thing I don't like about this coffee maker is that the basket does not holds enough coffee. It is just to small. I like my coffee strong so when you make six cups the basket will only hold five scoops of coffee. (I have to really shake it down to get the five scoops in). It would be a better coffee maker if it was a little wider then taller and it had a bigger basket to hold more coffee."
5,Works great and holds up--three years and going strong,"There are so many positive reviews here, that it hardly needs another, but I just want to say that after owning a Faberware that made weak coffee and seemed to work worse and worse over time (despite washing between every pot and cleaning with coffee-maker cleaner and/or white vinegar regularly), this Presto has been fantastic. We've owned it now for several years, and it's as good as the day we bought it. Where the Faberware made little popping sounds as it brewed, from the Presto we hear gushes of water splurging up the pipe and into the basket. A small thing, but another pleasure is how this pours compared to the Faberware--perky and fun to pour. My wife thought the Faberware was cuter at first, but after using this, she loves the spout and handle. It has a style that grows on a person. Life's little pleasures."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This coffee pot is wonderful. The coffee stays hot and tasty. This is the 2nd one that I've had - the first one lasted about 9 years and was used every day, several times a day. Would definitely recommend!!"
3,Dissapointed!,I bought this as a replacement for the same Coffee Maker but the top was out of round and the cap fit is very poorly. However there are very few choices remaining for perk style coffee makers.
3,Needs a filter! But you wouldn't know that from the description,"I converted from a Faberware Percolator because the coffee was no longer hot. We love the percolator over the automatic drip because of ease of use and fuller flavor. We were super disappointed to learn that this requires a filter, which is multipart folding project.Pros:Gets your coffee hotLike the ready lightEasy to see the cup lines when filling with water, unlike the FarberwareCons:Absolutely must use filter or you get some grounds in nearly every cup"
5,"WLM Corpus Christi, Texas","Had one years ago. Lost it in a move. Best coffee maker I ever had. Coffee brews faster than a drip,easier to clean and takes up less space."
5,Great percolator!!,I have used this percolator every day for 9 years. It gives me great coffee every morning!
5,"Full, rich flavor and piping hot!","Great percolator - My instant read thermometer read a brew temp of 202 degrees, far superior to that of most any drip brewing system (most brew around 180, coffee ""experts"" suggest a brew temp of 196-206 degrees - just below boiling)using a genuine percolator grind on my beans i did not suffer many grounds in the bottom of the pot (good for those of us who do not like to chew the last cup in the pot) keeps coffee hot for as long as you leave it plugged in. Flavor has been consistently rich and full - a fantastic experience every morning!"
4,Best coffee I've had at home in years,I have had the Presto 6 cup coffee maker for several months now and I like it a lot. The coffee tastes so much better than coffee from the drip coffeemakers. I do not see myself using the drip coffeemakers again. I do wish I had gone for the 8 or 10 cup model though primarily because it would probably be easier to hold the tube and insert the basket. But all in all I am pleased with it and would purchase again.
2,Makes no coffee half the time; only produces hot water,"Half of the time the percolator does not make the coffee. It only produces hot water. However the coffee grinds are soggy and have to be thrown out. The percolator part just does not live up to expectation. When it does make coffee it works fine, that is why I give it two stars. The type of filter it uses is another irritation. It makes a shallow basin for the coffee to sit in and thus most of the time the coffee grinds are in the coffee and not in the recevoir intended for them.All in all not a very good experience. I had really expected something better from Presto."
5,RELIABLE & REASONABLE PRICE,Makes great coffee since I bought this in early 2010. I waited until 2011 to write review. I purchased paper filters as it made the coffee taste much smoother. So far I have not been disappointed and I have used it over 50 times and still makes consistently good coffee.
2,disappointed,After about 3 weeks the small water collector that is spot welded to the inside top of the coffee maker fell off while I was washing it.
4,Great coffee,"I purchased this coffee maker after my Farberware percolator stopped functioning properly. Frankly, I chose Presto basted on reviews here - and also that it was produced by an American company. (Much to my surprise, the bottom of the pot shows ""Made in China""). Regardless, this percolator makes a great cup of coffee and I'm happy with the purchase."
4,Is it all stainless steel?,"I bought this coffee maker based on some of the reviews that it is stainless steel. Well, I can tell that the inner side of the vessel is stainless steel and the compartment where you put your coffee, the same goes for the inner bottom surface except for the middle part of the floor. The color changed or it may have been different from the beginning but I haven't noticed. I wipe it with a napkin and try to smell any rust but I haven't smelled any yet. I just wished that this thumb sized piece was made of a better material. Otherwise, I use it everyday and it works perfectly fine."
5,Better than Keurig,"This is the best coffee maker that I have used/owned. If you are looking for a real coffee maker (not keurig), than this is one of your best options. Definitely the best option at this price point.All stainless steel construction, except for the base and the handle, but these parts are not connected to the brewing system or carafe.The coffee does not burn when left on for hours at a time, like with a glass carafe on a burner.Easy to clean.It's a bit more work to load it than other coffee makers, but its worth it."
2,Disappointed,"Presto 02811 12-Cup Stainless Steel CoffeemakerAfter all the wonderful reviews, I was disappointed in this product. Perhaps mine was defective, but the coffee took double the brew time stated. It also had a terrible metallic taste. The coffee was and stayed very hot, too bad it tasted awful. I am sending it back and will keep looking!"
1,weak coffee,"Had it for two weeks.Many times, the coffee was delicious.On two occasions the coffee was brewed little stronger than water.That was enough for me - I returned it."
5,first time using presto coffeemaker,"I am a believer in electric percolators and have always figured Farberware was the best model. I read a review from someone who used Farberware but switched to Presto. I decided to give it a try b/c the Farberwares always seemed to have a built-in obsolescence. I'm perfectly delighted w/ this electric percolator and recommend it to everyone. No problems, delicious coffee."
4,Great coffee,"We had a coffee maker prior to this one for three years and then it broke. We decided to try the presto as we've heard great things and it does live up to expectations. We do use coffee filters, size 2, to take away the grinds."
4,...Makes good coffee...,"To earn the last star, it would help if it had a ""water level indicator"" in the handle or somewhere besides trying to line it up with the ""stamp"" in the side. Even a clear ""tube"" would help!!!"
1,Lasted less than 90 days,"While it worked, the coffee was okay but lots of grounds, even using the recommended filter. One morning, after less than 3 months, it just quit working. Now it is just an expensive un-insulated metal pitcher. Might make a decent planter but a waste of money as a coffee maker."
2,Glue did not hold up,"Hey Guys, so after using this coffee pot everyday for 3 month, the glue between the plastic base and metal percolator separated. It still works, but the wiring is constantly being exposed. I wouldn't recommend it overall."
5,Great Coffee Maker that does not Disappoint,"I was always a big fan of Farberware, but over the years, their life expectancy dwindled..they lost the ability to heat well..So, the last time I needed a coffee maker, I got a Presto and loved it..it lasted for years..now I needed another one and I got a Hamilton Beach one in a local store..it was difficult to make the top fit and close. Not a bad pot, but it was heavy and as I said, very difficult to close..so we ordered a trusty Presto again and it did not disappoint. It makes delicious and hot coffee every single time. We still have the Hamilton Beach one for the weekends when we entertain a number of people for brunch..it works OK and is getting easier to get the top on..but for the money, the Presto is the best..it lasts for years, it works well and makes great coffee..enjoy it.."
3,No Auto Turn Off,"Nice pot. Like the smell of coffee brewing in the kitchen. I am able to use it for coffee and tea. The bad thing is that there is no auto turn off. So, if forget and leave it on when going out, I have to go back home for fear of a fire!"
5,Excellent Product,Makes great coffee! I was looking for a replacement for my grandmothers percolator and I didn't think I would find anything that would make coffee as good as that one. I highly recommend this product.
3,good perculator,"purchased this jan 2010.. worked GREAT, bought one for gift.now feb 3011, it has mine quit! basically $5 a mo for great coffee. sure wish it lasted longer. now I ordering another."
5,fast and reliable,"After researching a variety percolators we chose this one because it has a very reasonable price and because it is very reliable. We have several coffee making systems such as melita, french press, and expresso. This is the best because it doesnt need to be monitored at all and it keeps the coffee at peak temperature after the brewing cycle."
5,Presto 12-cup Stainless Steel Coffeemaker,"Amazon free shipping we like. Competitive price of Presto we like. Simple design of Presto coffeemaker we like. We do not brew coffee but use the pot to heat water for tea, instant coffee, hot cocoa and hot water for cooking."
4,DON'T KNOW WHY I WAITED SO LONG,"I grew up with perked coffee. Then along came ""drips"" and we were all convinced this was progress and just bought newer models every couple of yrs. One day an elderly couple served me perked coffee fresh from the pot and I remembered what a good cup of coffee tasted like. This product gives me a fine, delicious, HOT cup of coffee every morning, and keeps it HOT."
5,Coffeemaker,Great product. Makes a very good cup of coffee and keeps the rest of the pot hot enough to enjoy and not burnt tasting from over heating.
1,Really weak coffee,"I bought my Presto here on Amazon and after all the great reviews, I'm really disappointed. The coffee comes out very weak, no matter how many grounds are in the top. Never having used a percolator, I have nothing to compare it to, but I'm wasting tons of good quality organic coffee only to end up with a very weak cup. One time, the coffee poured simply as clear hot water. The way the pieces sit in the percolator must had something to do with that. The top piece rests on a pole with a spring and you can't push it down - it sort of bounces up and down and doesn't ""sit"" straight.I don't know if all percolators are like this, but I'm really disappointed for what I paid and for the great reviews. I wanted to get away from using a coffee maker with plastic pieces being in contact with hot water, but I unfortunately think I'm going back to my Mr Coffee......."
1,BEWARE OF PRESTO CUSTOMER SERVICE,I CHOSE THIS COFFEE MAKER AFTER READING REVIEWS ON MANY DIFFERENT BRANDS. I THOUGHT THE POSITIVE REVIEWS AND THE REASONABLE PRICE MADE THIS THE POT FOR US. HOWEVER I WAS WRONG. AFTER USING THIS POT TWICE IT QUIT WORKING. I CONTACTED PRESTO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD TO RETURN (AT MY EXPENSE) THE COFFEEMAKER. AFTER ABOUT 1 WEEK AND NO WORD I E-MAILED AND ASKED FOR VERIFICATION THAT IT HAD BEEN RECIEVED AND WHEN TO EXPECT A NEW ONE. I AM BEING TOLD THAT IT MAY BE 2 TO 3 WEEKS BEFORE THEY WILL HAVE THE PAPERWORK TO EVEN KNOW IF THEY HAVE THE POT AND MAYBE WEEKS BEFORE A REPLACEMENT WILL BE SENT. LONG STORY SHORT--I AM GOING TO WAL MART AND BUY A GE PERCOLATOR BEFORE I WAIT A MONTH FOR THIS ONE. AT LEAST IF IT DOESN'T WORK I CAN RETURN IT AND I WONT' HAVE TO DEAL WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE.
2,A little more control would be nice...,"Our new percolator, whom we have named ""Bubbles,"" makes a pretty good cup of coffee on occasion, but a little more control over the length of brew time would be a welcome feature. Our previous percolator, ""Betty,"" had this ability and, since both my wife and I like a stronger cup of coffee, it is one we should have included in our purchase considerations. There are times when all we get is a cup of hot water, which seems more like a defect than anything else.While Bubbles makes a good cup of coffee sometimes, the price is reasonable, and we are working hard to adjust. Like Betty, she also emits an almost erotic series of moans and sobs throughout the percolating process.I miss Betty."
1,Produces burnt flavor,"I was so looking forward to having a new coffee maker that would not be letting the grounds touch plastic... but the water might be reaching too hot of temperature, I don't know, because after 5 days of trying and after buying the most expensive and delicious percolator grind coffee I could find, it still doesn't taste right... so I'm returning it...Also, it is a little more cumbersome to clean it, refill it with grinds and water, etc... the whole routine takes more time than your normal coffeemaker..."
2,Presto 02822 6cup stainless-steel coffee Percolator,WORKED REALLY WELL AFTER A FEW MONTHS DIDNT PERK A GOOD CUP OF COFFEE. VERY WEAK BREW. TO BAD. DONT KNOW WHY DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED.THEY DONT MAKE THEM POTS LIKE THEY USED TO. JUNKY JUNKY JUNKY. WE ARE GOING DOWN THE DRAIN WITH EVERY THING THATS MADE THESE DAY.S BACK TO THE GOOD OLD FRENCH PRESS OR THE CAMPING POT .
3,Just an alright coffee maker,"Well, I received the coffee maker and as the saying goes 'you get what you pay for' in many instances, is true. I wish there were a way to see the water level on the outside as the measuring marks are on the inside where you are trying to add water and it is a bit of an inconvenience. I don't think it makes truly great coffee as someone else had reviewed. I'm alright with it but not super impressed. I kind of wish I had gone with a stove top model like my parents had when I was growing up. It made very, very good coffee consistently. My uncle was picky about his coffee and swore by it. Although I am looking up tips to improve the coffee that I can brew at home."
3,They don't make em like they used to.,It's nothing special and can't be immersed in water like the one it's replacing. I got it for my parents and the old one was over fifty years old. Time will tell.....Took nine (count um) nine days to deliver via Amazon Prime.I should have bought a used one from ebay
5,Nice Product,The 6 cup Presto fulfilled all of my needs. I had been using a 12 cup perc but my wife has to drink decaf after 3pm so now I make a 6 cup morning pot of high octane and then a second pot in the afternoon of decaf. You can't beat a perculated cup of coffee and this machine does not dissapoint. I can't speak to the reliability as I have only utilized for a couple of weeks.
3,Not for everyday coffee making,"Bought this percolator based on the really high reviews. I love the size and I think it would be perfect for traveling, camping, or things like that. I wouldn't recommend it for everyday home use though. It's a huge pain to clean assuming that you don't use the paper filters. And if you use the paper filters then the coffee always seems to be real weak. We didn't mind having the few grounds at the bottom of the pot, just make sure to ground your coffee to the coarsest setting at the grocery store. We ended up just getting another drip coffee maker for everyday use which is much easier to clean and we can set for a specific time. We are keeping this and might try it out for camping or traveling though."
5,Presto Coffee Maker review,"Price and shipping were very good. Although themillwork on the interior of the pot is somewhatgrainy, the pot makes coffee well. Thisreview was made after two weeks of daily use."
3,Why is it so hard to make a quality coffee maker?,I was so disgusted with auto coffee makers that I went with a perculator ... we have used it for one month and a piece of plastic broke off the side already??? It hasn't affected the taste or performance of the coffee or pot - but broken so soon!!! I am soooo sick of junk products - this is why companies are going under?? I will keep it but don't recommend it. My fav Braun pot isn't being made anymore???? Go figure.
3,doesn't turn off when it boils...,"Ok, so it does eventually turn off, but it boils for over a minute before it shuts itself down. The automatic turn off feature is one of the reasons I bought an electric kettle. Other than that, it works as expected, pours out well and looks good on the counter. Just don't leave it on and leave the house!"
3,its ok,"This coffee pot is ok for the money, but the quality of the product is poor. The basket for the coffee is weak and bendsjust by emptying the grinds. The farberware fastperc pot has a much stronger construction, but the electronics dont lastfor everyday use."
2,not all stainless steel,"i had to write this review because i contacted presto regarding a metal taste in my coffee. i was told that the bottom part of the maker (the round shaped bottom inside the pot) is not SS, but instead aluminum. just a warning. not sure what is better aluminum or plastic parts, but now you are warned."
1,Leaks,This thing leaks where the plug goes into the base. Overall the coffee maker is built well but I experienced the leak that some other people here have reported. I would not buy again...
3,Nice But There Are Drawbacks,"Positives: Attractive percolator, coffee tastes good, easy to set up & clean out.Negatives: Doesn't really make 12 cups because you can't fill the water to the 12 mark, and still fit the filter basket in without pushing it down into the water. Makes about 8 cups at most, and if you make 8 cups, the grounds spill out into the coffee and in all of the different pieces. Also it's hard to make only 2 cups of coffee.Conclusion: Great for making between 4-6 cups of coffee (which translates to 2-3 mugs of coffee). Otherwise, buy a different product."
1,Not completely stainless steel,"We are trying to get away from the plastic in drip coffee makers and after researching a variety of options, we chose to go with a percolator. The 12 cup Presto Percolator got good reviews and appeared to be just what we wanted. However, a few of the reviews said that there is aluminum in the percolator. This bothered me since everything else indicated it was completely stainless steel - so I called Presto (1-800-877-0441) and asked about the aluminum. The representative said that the perk well - which is the part that the perk tube sits into - is aluminum so that the water can heat faster. All other parts are stainless steel. To me this is deceptive advertising since Presto does not indicate anything but stainless steel anywhere on their information. May not be an issue to some but was a deal breaker for us. Just an FYI.."
5,Presto 6-Cup Percolator,I have been using a coffee maker for the last number of years - I had forgotten how good perked coffee is! The Presto 6-cup percolator is great and my morning coffee is wonderful.
3,Prsto coffee maker,"This a good looking coffee maker and it makes good tasting coffee. I, however, find it difficult to use as the basket is small and it is hard to avoid spilling the ground ground coffee beans while making a fresh pot of coffee. I think the maker needs to have a wider diameter."
4,If you like grounds in your coffee.......,"It works just fine, but no matter what we do to keep the grounds in the basket, they find a way of getting into the coffee."
5,very satisfied,"Not only do I love the taste of the coffee and the retained heat of the coffee, but serving it in this coffee maker feels elegant. The product is quite nice to bring to the table, even with company!"
5,presto coffee maker,We use this presto coffee maker at our camper. My husband take it out on the porch and has his morning coffee we think it is great. It make delicious coffee and the apperance of the item is elegant
3,Not all stainless steel,"I just got the 6 cup coffee maker, and chose this model since it said it was stainless steel. I was trying to get away from plastic and aluminum for health reasons. I have recently heard this model may not be all stainless, so I called Presto today. The girl in customer service said all coffee makers have aluminum heating elements and said ""good luck"" in finding one that did not."
4,so good so far!,"My old perc lost it's knob and I bought this one. I am enjoying it, although it doesn't seem to make as good a coffee as my older/heavier percolator. It seems like the stainless on this model is lighter/thinner than my old one. For the price, I am happy enough, and this one does perc much faster!"
1,Just okay,I had a small 4 cup percolator and it worked great. But I lost some of the parts in a recent move so I dediced to buy this larger one.The coffee is always weak no matter how much coffee I use or how little water I use.Having to use a filter is just silly.Just overall not happy with this purchase.
3,Not as good as the originals...,"Just received this coffee pot today, and am somewhat disappointed. It's much thinner metal than the coffee pots we had back in the 50s and 60s, and there's no indicator on the handle side like there used to be, so you know how much water and/or coffee is in the pot. Nor does it have that a little glass thingy at the top so you can see the coffee percolate. We used a filter, but coffee grounds were all over the top of the basket when we opened it.Plus, the lid fits so tight that it's hard to remove. We've opened it twice, and the basket and lid popped up and moved out of place both times.All things considered, I wouldn't buy this coffeemaker again. In fact, I may be looking for a replacement."
2,makes good coffee,"This coffee maker makes good coffee. It's well made and stylish in a retrograde sort of way. It takes 24 ounces of water to fill it to the ""six cup"" mark inside, so I'd call it a 3 cup maker, or maybe a 4 cup maker, but not 6 cups. That's ok though, since I'm usually making coffee for myself. But even using percolator style paper filters, sediment still ends up in the coffee. And its a bit harder to clean than a drip style maker. I can handle harder to clean, but not the sediment. So I bought another drip maker."
3,Not for those who like strong coffee,"Makes very hot coffee quickly, but just too weak for my taste. I wish the coffee basket were bigger so I could increase the coffee-to-water ratio. If you like your coffee strong, your best bet is a French press or stovetop espresso maker."
5,Percolator replacement,"Pot just arrived. On time. Good packing. Hoping it lasts longer than the Farberware pots that the family has been having trouble with...electrical problems, melting spots on the base, etc. Will see how long it lasts!"
2,A bit disappointed,"My sister-in-law had a very old Farberware Stainless Steel percolator and her coffee was always outstanding. After reading reviews, it appeared that Farberware had changed several components from stainless to plastic and was no longer highly recommended so I decided to purchase the Presto. It was fine for about the first few weeks. Thinking the problem might be one of residue and oils, I attempted to clean it. Presto Customer Service suggested running a dishwasher tablet through the perk cycle. This did not really take care of the problem. Overall I would not recommend it. Suggest trying to find an old style unused Farberware percolator."
4,Flavor,"After visiting various people who have returned to perked coffee, I decided to also return. I love coffee and do not care for any nuts, twigs, foam, etc etc. After tasting the perked coffee I knew then that I had wasted many a good morning on drip coffee. We bought the Presto 12 cup and have been more than satisfied."
2,"decent flavor, but I expected more.","Comming from a regular coffee pot, I expected it to have richer flavor. Its fine (better than my old coffee pot) but even with Tim Hortons coffee, it still doesnt taste like Tim Hortons (you upstate NY and Canadians know what Im talking about lol)..Takes a long time to brew (I have it on a timer so its not a big deal). Easy to clean, seems well made, just wish it had a richer flavor."
4,presto buena caliodad para cafee,es muy bueno para pasar cafe excelentees el cafe con mas gustoel material muy buenosuper economicoy muy tradicional
4,Does the job!,"Doesn't seem as nice a finish as my last one, but it works as intended, making good coffee and much better than drip."
5,Just as hoped,"Makes the perfect, hot cup of coffee. Have been waiting for a pot that could brew hot and this does."
1,Makes weak coffee,I put the same amount of water and grounds in this percolator as I usually use my drip coffee maker. The result was weak and tasteless coffee that was more like tea. I think it stops percolating too soon. It is all stainless steel except for the black plastic parts. The basket and tube are stainless steel. It seems to be really well made. It just doesn't perc long enough.
2,Disappointed,"I've had this percolator for three months, and the plug going into the percolator is going (and, of course, the return window has expired). Other than that, we love this percolator. Just wish I could find one with a decent plug, and maybe I wouldn't have to buy a new one every few months! Purchased this one instead of the Farberware -- the Farberware one lasted about a year, so I'll be going back to that one."
2,PERCOLATORS,"I have to purchase a new percolator every 1 to 3 years because that's as long as they last. All of the percolators today are made in China even though the brand names are still American and, they're simply poorly made junk. They look fine on the outside but, invariably, they fail electrically far faster than American made products that were once available."
3,Great coffee,"I had a Faberware that this replaced and it works fine but it is much lighter material, almost to the point of being flimsey. I don't know if faberware is still as thick a material as it use to be but I kind of miss the old heavy pot and basket. I purchased this because it was cheaper than the faberware. Three stars might seem unfair because this is not misadvertised and it works as advertised but I was a little dissapointed."
4,Presto percolater a good buy,"I like my new coffeepot. I have always had Farberware percolaters, but they are not the same quality as they use to be. I'm very pleased with the Presto."
4,"Presto delivers warm, well-brewed coffee","Except for the hot plate being perhaps a little too hot, the Presto percolator delivers warm, well-brewed coffee in a jiffy. I normally use a French press, but in the winter it's a bit too chilly for that, so the Presto became a handy substitute, and I can use my French press for measuring fluids."
1,Looks great but worst coffee ever,I'm a big coffee guy - have every coffee gadget out there - every type of coffee - you would be better melting brown crayons sticking it in hot water and having a swig.
1,"Worked great for 2 weeks, then just weak brown water.","Thought I had found a good product, now I am going back to a drip coffee maker. - - - - - - -Perfect, quality little 6 cup percolator. This seems to have quality & finish I hadn't expected. We always try to buy America made first, but couldn't find coffee percolators made anywhere but China. The coffee doesn't touch plastic in this pot, which I like. I connected this to a GE digital timer and have fresh coffee every morning not processed through plastic. We shopped local stores like Macy's and couldn't find anything like this or even a 6 pot percolator. Very satisfied with this product."
1,Presto is a -0- star coffee maker : (,"I bought this coffee maker about a year ago. At first it made a good cup of coffee, with the help of a paper filter. Recently the cord became very hot to the touch at both the plug on the pot as well as the recepticle on the wall. When I say HOT, I mean HOT! It went in the trash after I bought a new cord at a hardware store. It didn't fit properly, so in the trash it went. Good riddance, bad rubbish....."
4,"Good coffee, but messy.","Bought this after my mom's, hand-me-down, old perc finally quit working (after some 50+ years). My only complaint, the basket does not contain the grounds while perking, so when you open the top they are all over, and in the coffee. They do send paper filters, didn't know why since I have never had to use filters with a peculator, but now I know why! I found a solution though, I used the basket and lid from my old peculator and it worked great! No more coffee grounds all over the place, Presto, you need to do better! Bottom line... great coffee but messy."
5,Presto Excellante,"Thank you for asking. After two Faberware coffeemaker failures, Presto was a refreshing change. It makes a rich brew within a reasonable time, so far. I have to remember to not submerge the main, handled, part when cleaning the interior, as the directions say. It is large enough but also small enough. It looks good in my kitchen, so I can leave it out after cleaning it and while drinking from it. I look for a stainless steel, perculator, type coffeemaker. The drip ones are too much plastic. If only the drip type coffeemakers were stainless steel."
3,Coffeemaker,Ordered this coffee pot for my husband as we used to have an old West Bend coffee pot that looked a whole lot similar to this new Presto. This new pot is okay. The main thing that we don't like about it is that you cannot immerse it in the sink for washing. Our old West Bend you could.
5,Makes the best coffee!,I bought the 12 cup model twice. The coffee is hot and quick and superb. I made the mistake of washing the first one with automatic dishwasher liquid and it affected the flavor. Won't do that to this model. I like this coffee machine so much that I bought it in a six cup model as well for when it's just me.
3,It does makes hot coffee,It does makes hot coffee but it makes it very watery. It doesn't matter how many scoops you put in it always comes out watery. I've even tried to overload it with grounds but that doesn't work either. The coffee does come out hot but that's about it.
2,Coffe Tastes Bad,"The pot performed as advertised, but the taste was not at all as expected. Our old ""on the burner"" perculator produces fine coffee, but this automatic job doesn't cut it. Changed brands and amount of coffee to no avail. I believe the problem is that it boils the coffee too fast."
5,It Works,This is the second Presto I've bought. The other one lived 6 years and then pffttt. That's fine. Appliances are not made to live forever as they did 50 years ago. I prefer perked coffee over drip and this makes a good cup of coffee and does it quickly. What more does any one want from a coffee pot?
2,"Great looking percolator, but...","Presto 02811 12-Cup Stainless Steel CoffeemakerI've given up on automatic drip coffee makers because they simply do not make the coffee hot enough for me, nor is the coffee that good tasting.This Presto brand 12 cup percolator is a very nice looking appliance, however the quality leaves much to be desired. Unfortunately, these are made in China, like everything else these days. They certainly know how to cut corners to save money and make a profit, but big deal!I found that the stem that holds the basket would not fit in place or stand up. I returned the unit for credit, which Amazon handled very promptly.I ended up being the winning bidder on a vintage, Regal brand Poly Perk electric percolator on EBAY, made in the USA! - I feel this is a far superior product, even if it is used. The Regal makes great HOT coffee."
5,Great Pot,Totally satisfied with this product makes GREAT coffee and simple to use and make only the amount of coffee you need.
5,Bought in 2008 - still going strong...,"I love my coffee maker... We bought this coffee maker in 2008... it is now August 2011, and it still works great!It works great from 2 cups of coffee (what they call ""4"" cups"") up to 5 or 6 cups (what they call ""12"" cups). We bought some of the Costco coffee filters, and just punch it down the little metal tube in the coffee basket so we get virtually no coffee crumbs.The trick is to try and not got the plug area wet I think. We also don't vigorously wash it, we just rinse it out with hot water and once in a while scrub it down or brew it with some white vinegar (no coffee).Sometimes we break up a cinnamon stick and it makes for a great Mexican Coffee..."
4,False Advertising. More like a 4 cup percolator,I ordered this 6 cup coffee maker. That is what the description says and that is what it says on the box. But what I got looked like it might hold 4 cups with the inside parts & coffee installed. I got a measuring cup and it will not even hold 5 1/2 cups of water empty. False Advertising!!! The container cannot even hold 6 cups of water without running over--it can't possibly make 6 cups of coffee. I am really disappointed. It is cute--but it is so small it looks like a toy. I can't comment on function because I am returning it.Update: I returned the 6 cup--without a problem I must say. I then ordered the 12 cup which makes a good cup of coffee. It keeps the coffee hot longer than my old coffee maker.
5,The greatest pot ever.,"I tried the stove top kind, but ended up with this. I have used it over a year with no problems. People who have had the coffee from it rave about how great it tastes. Just get one. You will not regret it. I do use standard basket filters and punch them over the hole because I am too lazy to clean out grains at 5:30 in the morning. It does not have an effect on the taste at all as I have tried it both ways, but makes clean up a breeze. Tastes and smells just like my grandmother used to make in the seventies."
5,So far so good,I have been buying Farberware for years and they kept dying on me and not keeping the coffee hot. This one produces a wonderfully hot product and keeps all of the the coffee hot for hours after initial perking. I am so happy I found this product and highly recommend it to all fans of hot perked coffee!
1,Residue forming on bottom,"I just bought this percolator and only used it five times when I noticed that there was some hard crumbly residue forming all over the center hole in the bottom (inside). I boiled a bit of water alone in the percolator and some particles from that residue floated in the water. I can imagine how much of that stuff went into my coffee already. I only use filtered water for my drinks, so the problem wasn't in water but in the type of material used for this percolator. Being made in China, no wonder... I will be returning it and look for a better thing that won't scare me."
3,Could have a few more features for the price,An OK coffee pot BUT I would have liked to see several items added1) a fill tube would have been nice the only marks are on the inside and they are not that evident.2) auto shut off after say 2 hours this pot just stays on forever if you let it3) an off switch also would be nice rather then having to pull the plugThings I will look for when I need a replacementOther then that it's a coffee pot
2,update on percolator,"I love the coffe it makes but don't like not having an off and on button or an automatic shut-off. Keeps the coffee good and hot though. Probably wouldn't buy again due to no shut-off.Here's my update: You cannot make more than 8 cups of coffee without this pot overflowing the basket and filling the pot with grounds. Not pleased about that. Also, it is most inconvenient without an on/off switch. I cannot recommend this pot."
2,Presto coffee percolator ?????,"We love our coffee in the mornings and evenings, specially my hot italian wife, who is totally addicted to at least minimum of 6 large cups of coffee a day and i am not kidding you, she drinks coffee like there is no tomorrow, so i purchased this presto 12 cup coffee percolator in April 2011 and now after few months in August it's broken, and before world ends in my wife's version of what is important in life, i better find some thing to sooth her, funny i used to think it was me, so any ways I am not happy with this coffee machine.PRESTO 02811 STEEL COFFEE MAKER 12CUP APPLIANCES KITCHENSeriously does anybody know of a great coffee percolator that works well? please let me know."
4,makes great coffee,"We have hard well water so the drip coffee makers crud-up quickly, plus they don't heat hot enough for great coffee so a perculator is the best of the best. I love the Presto since it is Stainless (no aluminum parts)and it perks a great pot of coffee.The only problem is the lid is difficult to put on due to the very tight fit. Minor, but irritating when I am not quite alert so early in the morning."
4,ZBEARZ,"It works! Its thiner, lighter and cheaper made than Fabarware & GE. Time will tell how long it lasts."
3,Presto Coffeemaker,"I was a bit disappointed that it did not have a glass knob on top so you could see the coffer perking. Also, the lid is hard to remove. I think the coffeemaker is a bit over priced. All in all I'm pretty happy that I purchased it. My mom had an electric percolator years ago and I guess I was hoping it would be like hers."
3,"Easy, Not Great Coffee!","I just received this pot about 4 days ago. It is sturdy and has a nice, sleek design. It is easy to use, except the stem is difficult to keep standing up while you put the basket in. Overall, good design. My biggest complaint is that the coffee is NOT STRONG. I keep adding more and more coffee in it and its still not strong and has a bitter after taste. It makes very hot coffee but if you leave it plugged in, within 45 minutes you will have the classic burnt coffee taste. I love perked coffee and Im going to keep adjusting the coffee amount and brand on this one. I have an old 1930's Farberware that actually makes much better coffee."
4,good coffee with minor problems,The coffee is Strong and Hot. A few problems 1. there area lot of grounds in the Coffee- You must use Wrap around filters-- much more expensive than the cheap filters to offset this problem. 2. The Cord is very short 2 feet + and must be set close to plug.3. the coffee pot is very noisey with wake the devil sounds that drive most people nuts.
4,"Hot, perked coffee","Our Faberware coffee maker wouldn't make coffee anymore. We got Presto because of the favorable reviews. It does indeed make hot, and tasty perked coffee!! What I can't understand is why it has so much trouble with the grounds. It would seem that a small fix by the manufacturer would make this a non-issue. After several experiments with various filters, we have conquored the grounds."
5,coffee make,Have used one of these for about 25 years---makes great perked coffee. We love it. We thought about buying one of the newer one cup makers but decided to stay with the percolater due to cheaper operation.
2,too quick,I recently purchased one of these. It does produce hot coffee; however I have to use about 40 percent more coffee to get the same body I was getting with my old GE pot. This pot perks too fast and its biggest drawback is the lack of adjustable brew-strength. I would not buy again
5,Good Cup of Coffee,"Having had two drip coffee makers break this year (one lasted 3 months, the other about 6), we decided to go back to a percolator. The aroma is great and the coffee stays hot. There are a lot of grounds in the brew unless a paper filter is used, although the holes in the basket are very small. It's messier than the drip pots, but it is still working so I'm happy. Ground coffee that didn't taste right in the drip pot tastes pretty good perked.**Update 2/1/2010, the percolator still works great, keeps the coffee hot enough and smells great while brewing"
5,coffeemaker,I love my new coffeemaker. It keeps my coffee hot & tastes better than the other pots I have had. No more messes on my counter with leaks. My mother-inlaw had one of these years ago and I have been looking for one to get for me. I highly recommend it.
4,"Not quite old school, but good for today's standards.","We bought this to replace a well-worn Farberware. Having read how the recent Farberwares are junk, I found reviewers that felt the Presto was up to snuff. We agree! The steel is not as thick as on our old unit, but feels sturdy enough for a few years anyway. We get the great percolator taste and HOT coffee (maybe a LITTLE too hot if you drink it black)."
2,keep looking,"I have owned two PRESO coffee percolators. The first one, stopped heating well after a year of daily use. The second one stopped heating well after three months. There is a weakness with the heating element, and even though this product is reasonably priced and has a ready/on light, I would keep looking."
3,good coffee maker with a short life,"Have owned the Presto coffee maker for about 6 months - makes good coffee, sometimes with unwanted grounds. Not working properly after 6 months - electrical cord will not stay attached to the pot and there is an electrical 'sizzling' sound from the coffee maker. Rather than search for a replacement cord I'm going with a non-Presto replacement coffee maker."
4,"Sleek, Stylish, Company Worthy","Features I like: Non-drip spout (saves the tablecloth); Super-hot coffee (for those who love lots of cream & still have hot coffee; 3 1/2"" disk paper filter works well (forget the awkward paper basket filter); Quiet and Quick - 6 cups in 6 minutes; Easy cleanup (stainless steel throughout). Would have liked to have ON/OFF Switch or Automatic turnoff. Accidentally left on unattended for 6 hours (but with no degradation to quality thankfully; yes, still piping hot). Only reason not 5-star review is there is no adjustment for brew strength. Need to add more coffee to make it stronger. Overall a good value."
5,Old school goodness,"We had gone through sooooo many coffee makers and stumbled on this one! We love it! It makes an excellent cup (or 4) :) of coffee and we love the retro look too! You will love this pot. It does take a little more cleaning then your standard glass or stainless pot but is well worth it. It also stays HOT until you unplug, no timer. Old school goodness."
2,Good... while it lasted ;(,"This is our second Presto ""percolator"" in the past year. They both broke shortly after the return period expired. Great, hot coffee. While it lasted."
4,Presto 6 Cup Percolator,"Overall I really like the percolator. The exterior is great looking and it brews a good cup of coffee. I would rate it a 5, except for the basket and cover. These two pieces have a cheap look and feel - it is hard to believe they are stainless steel. The coffee pot is quite tall and narrow making it a little move difficult to put in the coffee than if it were bigger in circumference. I use a filter in the basket and the coffee has a good taste and it is hot.El"
2,I changed my review from 5 Stars..buyer beware,"First of all, I really loved my perculator in the beginning and still would, except it has developed rust only in the heating ring element in the bottom of the coffee maker. It's not coffee stains it's rust. Otherwise it heats it perfectly and makes great coffee no matter the brand.Since I don't know what the long term effects of using it with rust, I opt for a different brand."
2,Not for the elderly,"We purchased this percolator for an elderly person. It would never have worked for him. Too Heavy for him to lift. The lid snapped on way too hard. The basket's tube was very difficult to get set in position. The spring on the tube appeared unnecessary and awkward. For a younger person, it might be fine.However, Amazon.com refunded our money very quickly. They were great to work with. I will not hesitate to order through Amazon.com again. Easy, squeezy, lemon, pezy!"
1,Hate it,I bought this as an alternative to my Cuisinart Grind & Brew which is a chore to clean daily. From the reviews I read I thought I would like it-but alas no. the 1st cup of coffee was ok-but just. From then on the coffee was lukewarm-and I am talking a time lapse of 5 or 10 minutes. Used it twice and then sent it to the charity shop. I went back to the drip style and bought a burr grinder and a Kitchen Aid 14 cup drip that is great.
1,Weak Coffee,We could not get the tube to sit flush in the bottom of the pot and consequently always had weak coffee. After chatting with customer service it was recommended to send it back which I did. I do not recommend this product.
5,"Good ""Old-Time"" Coffee!","I have purchase my last ""expensive"" coffee maker. These $129-$149 cooffee makers are made to last a day after the warranty runs-out, and the coffe containers are too expensive. I remembered that ""Old-Time"" fresh perked coffee, way back when, and decided to purchase the Presto 02822 6-Cup S-S Coffee Percolator. This coffee maker is simple, and makes great coffee! I recommend ordering the 3-year filter basket. In fact, I would order two at this price, as it makes empting the grounds very easy. ""Take an extra couple minutes and enjoy real, fresh perked coffee, or try the experence for the first time!"""
4,Great coffee,"Several months later, very happy with my percolator! I switched from a coffee press. Easy to use, clean, and store, and makes great coffee. Highly recommend this product."
4,"nice looking, smaller than I thought though...",This really is for making 4 cups of coffee. The coffee is not as hot as my old Farberware. Also it seems I need to add more coffee than usual to get the taste I prefer which is strong. Fast and easy to clean.
5,Hot coffee at last!,"McDonald's may have a problem serving hot coffee but I don't. I like/love/adore and constantly seek a good cup of coffee that is hot. The Presto perculator does just that, makes hot coffee and keeps it hot. I would suggest purchasing the reusable filter with your perculator, faster to set up. I used several different brands of coffee (all purchased from Amazon) and they were all good. Don't know much about gourmet coffee but I am an expert when it comes to hot and black."
3,Word Games,1001Ultimate Word Games (Jewel Case)The product is fine for what it is. My problem is I thought it was a variety of Word Games. It is pretty much Crossword Puzzles and variations of that type of puzzle. I was looking for more variety. I am a big fan of Text Twist and some others and thought there would be some of that type of word game included.
4,Word Games,"I've used this CD plenty and it has provided no end of entertainment for my 12 year old granddaughter. Since I can't get her to take her head away from a computer, at least she's using words and learning what they mean. Some of the games aren't really for adults, but as I said I've enjoyed using this CD very much."
4,Well done if a bit out of place,"I wish that David Spencer had paid more attention to the tv series before writing this novel. Some things just don't fit. However, the idea of Newcomers wanting so much to fit in that they risk their health to change their look is very powerful and unique. The writing was well done though frankly I think too much time was spent on the lives of the Francisco family and not on the case."
3,Needs Space for Air,"I like this rack a lot with respect to containing four drives, but there is barely any space between each drive. Inevitably this means lots of heat if multiple drives are running. I just had a disk failure on one of mine and I can't help but wonder if it had something to do with lack of ventilation. Maybe, maybe not.LaCie should improve on this by adding some space between each of the drives."
5,OUTSTANDING,"I'm using the d2 Desk Rack to hold (2) Lacie 2big network 2 raid boxes. The stand comes completely assembled made out of stamped stainless steel, then rolled and polished, complete with rubber feet pre-glued into place, and also includes stamped metal flat bars that slide into the top and bottom of each case, from there they are screwed into the Desk Rack. The assembly is quite sturdy and looks great. cooling is not an issue because of the aluminum case's that Lacie's builds around their drives."
5,Nice Rack,"What can I say? It's a nice rack, it does what it is supposed to, it arrived on time and works beautifully every day to hold my external hard drives."
5,Techno desk,"I have 2 LaCie D2 external drives and they look really good - and reside nice and stable and with tidier cables - on my desk in this well-made stainless steel custom rack.PS: I can't believe I actually felt moved to say a disk drive in a rack 'looked good' - but I did so I'll leave it. Problem is, to my eyes, it's actually true."
2,Lacie Desk Rack - Expensive for what it is,"This Lacie desk rack is pricy for what it is - a piece of folded metal with holes drilled into the side for the guide rails to go in. Finishing of the rack was not that great, some of the edges are a little rough to the touch. Whoever was sanding/grinding it down did not do a good job. You won't cut yourself but it's not up to the quality I would expect from Lacie. Slotting in the D2 drives are a piece of cake. There are 6 tiny pieces of rubber ""feet"" on the base of the rack that help in not scratching the surface of your table. Thus far, they work ok BUT I do expect them to go missing at some point in time as I think they use some kind of glue or double side tape to hold them to the steel frame.Nice design and looks great on the desk. Works for what it is but priced a little high."
5,A great rack,I have two LaCie 2tb drives installed in this. It can hold up to four but I do would not want to crumb four into into it. I think the drives need air flow around them so I have one mounted at the bottom and the other at the top. It is very easy to assemble and use.
2,bad experience,"no power cableno catridgeno drumno computer cablei received a skeleton printer of no use.i didnt know we can buy printers like thisvery bad experience. try to save money, butdidnt work.so no more buying with you guys"
3,Interesting ... but not as good as I thought ...,Maybe i'm getting old I guess.For the hardcore old school AB fans who have excess cash laying around for the next collectible.
4,"Fly, Zebraman, fly!","Shinichi Ichikawa (Show Aikawa) is a complete failure in his roles as 3rd grade teacher and family man. He fetishizes a superhero character from an old, short-lived TV series, spending his evenings dressed as Zebraman in a suit of his own construction, striking poses. The arrival of a new student (Naoki Yasukochi) and a wave of bizarre events lead him to discover the power within.This is not one of director Takashi Miike's ultraviolent films. Instead, he has made a very bizarre comedy that is mostly family friendly, always compelling, and often extremely funny. The script gets a bit sloppy at times in order to place characters where the filmmakers want them, but all of that is trumped by sheer goofy charm."
1,Even for the low price it is NOT worth it.,"Looking for a simple toaster that would simply toast bread, I bought this piece of junk. You have to press on the handle several time for the machine to hold the bread and toast it.Needless to say that it is pointless to try to adjust the lightness/darkness of the bread. This toaster is simply a total waste. I have never seen that."
5,Country Cross Stitch at its best,"Beautiful pictures, accurate charts and clear graphs makes this one of the best cross stitching magazines on the stands today. Projects range from easy and quick to advanced and unique. Every issue is packed with loads of creative ideas. In addition, you have access to some of the best shops in the nation for materials. Customer Service is wonderful with cheerful, helpful people who know the business and how to make your cross stitching experience relaxing and enjoyable. This magazine is a must for any cross stitcher."
1,didn't work,"The price was certainly right. However, after a couple of hours of playing with Custom 3D Land, I could not see any potential to make it work for my projects. Very cumbersome to build the background for the plot if you need windows/ doors, angled fence lines, etc. May be good for a classroom aplication where plots are hypothetical."
3,Technically well done; lacking in development,"The dialogue is excellent, as one would expect from a screen writer. The prose is lucid and enjoyable. However, the plot tries to deal with a mother-son relationship, a torrid affair with a married man involving questions of morality and a murder mystery.The result is that we don't care about the murder mystery because we don't know the victim and we feel that something is lacking in the rest of the plot development.5 stars for technical execution but minus 2 for lacking development. Overall, still enjoyable but could have been much better."
3,It made me want to stay in the big city,"Big City Blues has a cute start about woman trying to flee the harsh realties of the city to save her son. But she wants up in Boringville, Long Island filled with freeloading livestock and noisy neighbors. However I did enjoy the son's realtionship with the Klingon wannabe girlfriend and the mother's friendship the police officer."
2,Overly analytical,This book wasn't good at all. It took me several times of picking it up and putting it back down for a few weeks to finally get through most of it. The author goes through a situation too many times. She is overly analytical of everything happening instead of just telling a story.
1,A Perfectly Dreadful Book,"I only checked out this book at the library because I had heard about the author and there was nothing else I was interested in.It is awful! Have read only a few chapters and am not reading any more. If the author thinks she is cute and clever, she has really missed the mark.This is supposed to be funny? It isn't even a good read."
5,A MUST READ!!,"Wow! A great new author who can write a time-travel without bouncing back & forth between times confusing the reader. An incredible story of ""love at first sight"" between Al-Mon & Raina which constantly keeps the reader on ""the edge of the next page"" so to speak, to find out what perils lie in the way of their love. An interesting ending with a twist that makes you think..wow! what an imagination!. A must read. I can't wait for her next one!"
3,Prevents mealworms from escaping. Looks great.,"This will definitely keep the mealworms from escaping. It can easily hold dozens of one-inch mealworms plus some gutloading stuff and a slice of carrot. It's very well made and sturdy just like all the other Exo Terra pieces. All my decors and hides are Exo Terra so this matches the rest of what I have in my leopard gecko tank perfectly. However, some leopard geckos may not be able to find the mealworms inside. 1"" deep glass bowls are better for leopard geckos."
3,Exo Terra Worm Dish Mealworm Feeder,It's a little too small for my bearded dragon. He's has a pretty large head and the bole is too small.
4,good purchase,"good size and looks great in tank, i love it! slightly bigger to fit more worms in wouldve been better though"
2,Boring,"It's a sleeper. This documentary, while accurate, has the feel of someone reading to you out of a history book. It's dry. It's boring. There are no dramatizations. The pictures that are shown are simply the kind you would see in a history book and the camera just sort of pans over them from top to bottom. There are two historians that are interviewed, nicely dressed men that seem very credible, but they are pretty boring too.I bought this for my 8th grade daughter because it matched one of her history lessons. After previewing it, I knew that there was no way this would hold her attention. Heck, it didn't hold my attention. I found myself repeatedly zoning out.I am disappointed."
3,ORIGINAL NOIR THRILLER WITH A SUPER FEMALE LEAD.,"Jack O'Connell's Box Nine succeeds in many departments: It has an evocative and original setting, snappy dialogue and a super female lead that oozes charisma. And although the idea of a synthetic and brain-enhancing drug (Lingo), sweeping the streets and changing a culture is a nice idea, I don't think he pulls it off with much conviction."
4,A good beginning of a great series,"This is the first book in the Harpur & Iles detective series, although this debut novel mostly focuses on Colin Harpur. Through the use of many informants, Colin with the help of his precinct tries to spoil a robbery of the Lloyds Bank Branch of his town (which is never mentioned, an any of the novels). The characters come from many different walks of life, and the look into Harpur's not-exactly-angelic personal life is a nice touch. A great start to a series that gets even better after this."
