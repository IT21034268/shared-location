3,"A anti-Charlotte ""Brontes""","Juliet Barker's ""The Brontes"" is meticulously researched and extremely thorough. But for me the book is marred by Barker's relentless critique of Charlotte Bronte. She argues that Charlotte did nothing to help her brother in his alcoholism and depression, and ""could"" or ""should"" have done more. Even more distorted is her portrayal of Charlotte's involvement with her sisters' writing. Barker absolutely insists on the existence of another novel by Emily after ""Wuthering Heights"" (pure speculation based on an inquiry EB sent to her publisher). She then condemns Charlotte for having burned this hypothetical manuscript which in fact may not have existed! I finished the book wondering why on earth Barker would spend so much time reading and writing about someone she so clearly does not like."
3,Review,"of course this is a very academic, superbly researched book, however, the author cannot seem to tell a story. I understand that this is an academicbook, rather than a well told story that incorporates the academic. DRY, DRY...she takes a very long time to get to the lives of the children, however, she obviously felt that the father's role in their lives warranted several chapters to him, but excellent work. I admire the tenacity of the author, she is well deserved of many awards for this accomplishment. I hope her family survived (re: the introduction of her apology to them), but one has to do what they have to do in this lifetime!Julia"
4,"Great book, good condition",This is a great work of art. The one I purchased was in good condition as advertised.
3,Vivid imagination and fascinating prose,"I still remember, opening my father's dusty trunks filled with books in our attic and being introduced to the strange world of Morgana Royal. It was Corelli's indomitable Morgana who inspired me to choose a career in Engineering, and the notion that for a woman nothing is impossible if there is a thirst for knowledge.Through the years Morgana, with her great intellect and sarcastic wit has continued to be my inspiration. Corelli's prose is rich and vivid., and she makes Morgana believable and endearing. Bitterly cynical, the book rings with criticism of human society and men in particular, but it is Morgana who captures the readers imagination. The story contains some fantastical arguments about Miss Corelli's mystical beliefs, but still makes good reading."
4,Good Reference Book,"The book comes with all the information that is needed to prepare for the Certification. However it does not provide with specific examples as to how to use all the information. I would say this is a book to keep in the book shelf because it contains a lot of information: from Organizational Leadership, Team Development, Process Management, Quality Management Tools, Supplier Management and all necessary information needed to be known by a Certified Quality Manager. Lots of theoretical knowledge is portrayed on this book."
3,Rrequired reading,This item was required reading for Master of Organizational Management program. Found the info to be moderately helpful and easy to apply.
5,Peanuts Forever!,"I had been dying to watch Snoopy Come Home this past summer and decided it was time to add it to my collection. I first found this double feature, which I had no clue existed but was so thrilled because A Boy Named Charlie Brown is just as fantastic as Snoopy Come Home, at a local electronics store for $34 and was reluctant to buy at that price. Luckily I had my trusty Amazon iPhone App and I quickly found the same product for less than half the price! The shipping was as fast as always. I am so pleased with this product!"
3,So-So metal,"Not much on this one. Not as good as the first CD. If you are limited in funds, buy something else. If you are board with everything else, you might like this."
3,MITCHUM and mitchum,"This item technically qualifies as a Robert Mitchum double feature. Although he stars in AGENCY, Mitchum is ninth banana (as 'Pig-Iron' Matthews) in GUNG HO!: The Story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders.Ray Enright directed the contemporary WWII recounting of a Marine assault on a Japanese-held island that occurred shortly after Pearl Harbor was attacked. Following special training, Col. Thorwald (Scott) and men endure transport by submarine, then must assault an entrenched enemy of superior numbers.In AGENCY, Mitchum and his odd crew take over an ad agency and strange things begin to happen, including the ""suicide"" of Majors' best friend (Rubinek).Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 imdb user poll ratings.(5.1) Agency (UK/Canada-1980) - Robert Mitchum/Lee Majors/Valerie Perrine/Saul Rubinek(6.0) Gung Ho! (1943) - Randolph Scott/Alan Curtis/Noah Beery Jr./J. Carroll Naish/Sam Levene/Robert Mitchum/Rod Cameron/Milburn Stone/Chet Huntley (narrator)"
1,Product Information Missing Prior To Ordering.,What is the model number?Is this a referubised product?Is there a shipping charge?
3,Unbelievable details,"I was searching for a detailed history of Descartes, that is exactly what you get with this book. the details are so specific it almost becomes painful. the research and detail into Descartes life is very well documented within the text as a result of an endless review of Descartes letters.The book is more detail as to this life and the authors interpretation of his thoughts than of Descartes writings."
1,beware!!,This is NOT the complete series. Only goes through season five! I feel like I got ripped off big time!
3,I didn't live up to its title,"As an evangelical Christian I was expecting this video to be filled of great information. However, after watching it I was disappointed. I think it should be have been called ""Secular Jews & Catholics: A Journey of 'let's get along'."""
5,You TOO can own this!!,Can't say enough about this GEM. It's worth the money! I am offering ALL SIX VOLUMES for only 200 bucks! Free shipping too!! Ebay item 220135888455Don't miss this chance!!!
4,Praise Bj!,"This is really a nice CD to have if you ever need to put something on to help you relax and be at peace after a stressful day. He has always been underrated. His voice is fantastic. I couldnt give it 5 stars because I would have liked a couple more upbeat songs, or for that matter, more songs. There are only 10 on this CD. You get about 30 minutes of material and your just left with wanting more. Thats a compliment."
3,Best Correction Tape!,This is the best correction tape on the market! I only gave it 3 stars because Amazon's prices are not the best I've seen. I wish they would offer them in a bulk pack!
3,"Okay, but the BIC version is better","I read all these reviews, and since I've been using these white out things a lot recently for note taking, I figured I'd get this. I'd been using the BIC version of this since that was in my grocery store. Anyway, got this for the reviews here, was excited to try it for how positive people were. It doesn't roll on as easily as the BIC, it makes a scraping feeling that's like the chalkboard effect (strangely uncomfortable, don't know what it is), and it rubs off too easily. Go with the BIC."
2,It is great until it breaks,"My office orders these white out liquid paper dispensers all the time. I use them on a daily basis. They are amazingly useful...until they break. And that is why I am writing this review. This Papermate brand is so badly made, that the dispensers keep breaking. The last one I used broke the first time I used it. The small plastic part where the strip comes out broke off entirely. Most of the time, the big problem I have is that the strip inside the dispenser gets tangled, and thus the dispenser no longer works properly. I have not had any problems with the the Bic brand so far. I have asked my office manager not to buy this Papermate brand any more because there have been so many problems."
4,Application piece is very wide... can smear ink/tear pages,"These are problems I only discovered while studying for a major exam using a 600-page thin-paged review book. (1) Because the piece that applies the tape is roughly twice as wide as the tape itself, it can touch the page and smear ink near what you're trying to white out. (2) Also because the application piece is so wide, it can tear thin pages, especially if they are not PERFECTLY flat (which is the case when you have to study using a 600-page review book).If you use this product on normal computer paper flat on a desk and with ink that does not smear easily (although I've been using a regular ballpoint pen), you most likely will not run into these problems.The great thing about this white out tape is that the tape itself NEVER gets tangled (unlike the BIC version, where tape tangling can force you to throw out the tape before it's half-used).Despite these problems, I prefer this tape to the BIC tape under the majority of circumstances."
4,Much better than Staples brand,"This tape might be more expensive than Staples, but it's worth the price. Even when writing on top with a lot of pressure, this tape doesn't rip! It's also opaque enough to cover up black or dark blue ink. Unfortunately, it's tinged a bit yellow."
3,Could Be Better,"There's no question the story lines are good, and the characters interesting, but the pacing of the story is burdened by endless pages and pages of subjective dialog rehashing again and again the same thoughts and feelings of the characters that have already been covered. I'm skipping pages everywhere trying to find the STORY and am beginning to think the inclusion of this type of endless rehashing is little more than a way for a writer to fill pages, thus my 3 star rating. I would also tend to think that many of the reviewers of this book who have given it a 4 and 5 star rating, have not read ""The Princess & The Barbarian"" by Betina Krahn; ""My Wicked Highlander"" by Jen Holling; Susan Carroll's ""Dark Queen Trilogy"" - book 1; ""The Dark Queen"", book 2; ""The Courtesan"", and book 3; ""The Silver Rose""; ""Once a Warrior"" by Karyn Monk; ""The Prize"" by Julie Garwood, or Judith McNaught's ""A Kingdom of Dream's"" - one of my favorites, but sadly the only book by J. McNaught that I have enjoyed."
4,would purchase from them again,the product got here finally. was in good shape and wrapped well. I would purchase from them again.
3,Why not be better?,"I was hoping this video had a look at how sexuality in early cinema led to the adoption of the Production Code and how those changes affected movies. It's interesting but not nearly as good as the TCM doc ""Complicated Women,"" which isn't available on DVD. So given my expectations, I'd say this falls short of the mark."
2,"Great idea, poor construction","Our four year old is a ""dinosaur lover"". We bought this as a stocking stuffer, and it arrived from Amazon right away. We followed the directions and on day two, the egg ""hatched"". From there we added warm water to watch it grow, but it disinigrated in the glass into a pile of mush. We never did see the dinosaur grow. I would like to try it again adding cooler water to see if that makes a difference."
1,A big disappointment,"My son was so excited to receive this toy as a gift. But his joy quickly turned to disappointment. First, unlike other similar products where the egg just sort of dissolves, this product requires the toy inside to grow large enough to break the egg. According to the package, this takes anywhere from 48 to 72 hours. In other words, you better hope it doesn't break while your child is sleeping, or he will miss all the excitement. Second, once the dinosaur hatches, it's nothing but a slimy mess. The colors run all over the place, so that the features are completely indistinguishable. And the shape is just a big blob. So the toy your child has waited days for ends up being something that is destined for the trash can since its just an ugly, gelatinous blob. Save yourself the money and the tears and buy something else."
4,Good easy reference,"Not too heavy on theory, but sufficient enough to get you started. Discusses different types of microphones, connectors, and their use in certain settings. This would be good reference for somebody starting up a garage band, or managing a small sound system in a school. It's a fast read, but doesn't skip over important details. Has good pictures to help explain certain concepts, a decent enough appendix with glossary and basic wiring diagrams."
5,Great for Work,"when I was searching for this type of product the results were very limited. this product also seemed to be outdated, but it was the only one that seemed to be perfect for what I needed. I needed a way to listen to my ipod at work through my stereo bluetooth headphones without connecting either to my computer. I work for a gov't contractor and we're not allowed to connect any outside peripherals to our PCs.This device turned out to be the perfect solution....Now i can listen to my ipod all day long while at work!"
3,ok,"This was a decent toy, not great. A bit of fun, not made for littler kids as the pump action is needed to shoot the ball. If I had known, would have given it to my son when he was 7ish, not at 6."
2,Not Much More Immortal Beloved,"This CD contains 6 out of 8 tracks that were also included on the original soundtrack ""Immortal Beloved."" Why bother to include this CD in your collection, for just two additional tracks. Doesn't seem worth it to me."
2,The music is too soft.,The music is too soft. Even on the loudest settling I cannot hear a lot of it. Otherwise it is ok.
1,Completely against the truth,"Let me first say that this book is very one-sided. It's amazing how the author forgets how Pius was given the medal of honor in Israel by the Jews for his outstanding efforts in WWII. Only read this book if you want to laugh. Otherwise, don't read it."
1,misleading.....,"It seems as though many people either vehemently object to or support the merits of this book..... anybody can take either side of the debate and make it sound as if they are right while not having to deal with having their data put to the test...... I have heard cornwell attempt to defend his books merit in a debate on the radio.... it seems as though when his book is put to the test it fails miserably as was exhibited by his inability to hold his own in the debate.... I think people on both sides of the debate should read material supporting both standpoints... maybe then they will reach some sort of consensus.... the truth sure was clarified when listening to cornwells debate. Besides, simply reading this book while refusing to take into account the other side (or visa versa) simply amounts to ignorance of the topic."
2,"Catholic Bash, Fact, or Fiction?","Could it be that Cornwell's book was designed to create a controversy and thereby increase sales? Cornwell has no academic degrees in history, law or theolopgy and the substance of his book is marred by shoddy scholarship. Kenneth L. Woodward rightly stated in his review of Corwell's cheap shot at Pius XII in the September 27, 1999, issue of Newsweek: ""Errors of fact and ignorance of context appear on almost every page."""
1,Terrible,"Let me first say that this book is very one-sided. It's amazing how the author forgets how Pius was given the medal of honor in Israel by the Jews for his outstanding efforts in WWII. Only read this book if you want to laugh. Otherwise, don't read it."
3,"Fascinating information, but not really a good book","I frequently read books on historical matters to educate and entertain myself simultaneously. While this book is incredibly well researched, it's poorly organized. It completely fails as an historical narrative. There are frequent long digressions on characters of minor importance, the author jumps forward and backward in time for no apparent reason, and there is much repetition. The whole thing needs to be rewritten from start to finish. If you are hoping to be diverted as well as educated, you may be very disappointed."
1,Sensationalism Sells,"I tried to approach this book from an objective point of view, but found the highly subjective and biased research of the author hard to stomach. I have read both this book and the Vatican's version of the accounts - both presumably written from the same historical information in the same archives. It is obvious that Pius XII was not an anti-Semite who collaborated in the destruction of the Jews - but that is a popular topic today and it sells. The author, who claims to be a practicing Catholic, is also an ex-seminarian - and they always seem to have a chip on their shoulder when it comes to the Catholic Church. May God forgive him for the injustice he has done to the Church."
5,Brilliant indictment,"Cornwell provides an unbiased account of the moral failure of Pius XII. His book is not ""anti-Catholic"" ... ; rather, his book is a wake-up call to both Catholics and non-Catholics alike to not put unwavering faith in any leader, religious or political."
2,Cornwell's View,"A relatively easy read. The chronology is rather loose and jumps around more than I cared for. Certain positive issues and programs sponsored by the Vatican are ignored. Also, some negative situations addressed seems to be a more grabbing at straws to shore the argument, not much meat to them. Other determining factors were well covered. It could have been a little more balanced in my opinion. Not my favorite read on the issue."
1,A Man on a Bandwagon,"An unfortunate addition to the slander of Pius XII. Cornwell apparently wants to cash in on the current Holocaust bandwagon, for, despite his claims to the contrary, he has done little original research, but has simply built a circumstantial case largely on conjecture and distortion. He counts upon his readers' ignorance of the topic, or their preconceptions, to carry his argument. It certainly fails to stand on its own. Useful to see the lengths some will go to shift the blame for the Holocaust from the Nazis, but of little value beyond that."
3,Appeasement,"In 1933 when the treaty with Germany was signed, the major concern of the Catholic Church was the safety of it's own people. In 1939, Munich was the same event for nations. To place a burden upon a single man for the downfall of a nation, stretches the imagination. Self-centered and myopic, yes, that does describe most of the curia. However, to place the Concentration Camps and the death of 13 million people on one treaty, no, that makes no historical sense.The book is well written and reads fairly smoothly, but lacks a wide view of the whole world view needed to represent the whole truth. What I found was a smattering of truth, followed by conjecture, ""if"", ""had"" ""what if"", as I tell my students, ""what if"" doesn't matter, it is ""WHAT IS"" that matters in history."
1,Lies and More Lies,"This book was written by a man with an axe to grind with the Catholic Church. He is not a practicing Catholic, as he misled his readers to believe. He has been openly hostile to the Church in the past, which you would know if you read other works by this man. I have studied this part of history extensively, and I know that there are far batter sources that demonstrate just how far Cornwell has gone in mangling the truth. Familiarize yourselves with the facts before you give this book anything other than a one-star review. The more you read on this subject, the better you will recognize just what nonsense this book is."
1,Is the author serious?,"This book is about as factual about Pius XII as was Dan Brown's 'Da Vinci Code' about the role of the Catholic Church in suppressing the truth about Christ's wife.If you want a proper review about the role of Pius XII, I recommend Rabbi David G Dallin's scholarly review of this matter in his book 'The Myth of Hitle's Pope'."
2,Nice Try.,"Not the best research book I've read. The facts in Cornwell's book contrast with many others on the subject, whether they are supportive of Pius XII or not. He focuses too much on his opinion of how evil Eugenio Pacelli was as a person, frequently misquoting and manipulating events. His lack of sufficient endnotes is impressive, it seems he didn't really take advantage of the documents he supposedly had exclusively seen. I recommend instead Hitler, the War, and the Pope, by Ronald J. Rychlak."
2,"Boring, boring, and oh yes, boring","This book is incredibly factual. Simulatenously, it didn't hold my interest for more than 10 minutes at a time. I read this book for my international relations class, as a choice book. I thought that it would be an interesting subject, and thought that I would enjoy it. I was completely wrong! It offers plenty of information regarding Pacelli, but the way that it is presented resembles that of a history textbook. I found this book a chore to read."
1,Record straight,"This is the most hateful and dishonest book ever written during the 20th century. Cornwell sinfully and shamelessly violates truth again and again. Cornwell shall pass into history as a sample of what sheer dishonesty and intellectual misery can achieve. May Almighty God bless again and again the blessed memory of our Holy Father Pius XII.p.s. for an exposure of Cornwell's lies read the book ""The Myth of Hitler's Pope,"" by Rabbi David Dalin, available in Amazon as well."
1,Anti-Catholic Propaganda,"What was John Cornwell after when he wrote this book? Teaching us history? Pleading a case? Unveiling a conspiracy? Or was he simply trying to get us to resent the Catholic Church as he does? Obviously, the subject of His Holiness, Pope Pius XII and WWII wasn't properly researched, and bred forth from nothing but a life-long resentment of the Roman Catholic faith. Bah, I'm surprised this piece of junk is even still on the shelves."
1,poor and partial,"the boock is not documented, partial and in some cases misinformed. moreover it contains factual mistakes. poor service to the truth"
5,A Must Read,"Catholics should not be turned off of this superb book because of its title. It is very well researched and very well written. In it Cornwell clearly shows how Pius VII abandoned all decency and morality for the sole purpose of concentrating total control of Church affairs in the hands of the papacy. He emasculated Catholic political parties in Hitler's Germany and muzzled German bishops to this end.Since the present pope has the same agenda, it becomes obvious as to why Paul wants to elevate Pius XII to sainthood."
3,Vocabulary gets in the way,"This book is full of very interesting information, but the sentencing and the wording can get a reader very tangled up. The foreign names and various other words are necessary to the work and are enough to deal with. Unfortunately the author chooses to explain facts in such complicated and mind boggling long sentences that the reader must struggle through the rhetoric. Tends to ""water down"" the impact. I also found myself completely disgusted with my church (I am a Catholic) and enraged by the negative and selfish motives of this Pontiff. It shakes up our belief in the motives of Peter's successors!"
1,Does anyone ever think to check this research of Cornwell's?,"I find that, after having written a report on Pius XII, he was a great friend to Jews. Over 85% percent of Jews survived in Italy - more than any other country in Europe. And virtually every Jewish organization worldwide congratulated Pius after the war. The New York Times called Pius a ""lonely voice against Nazi atrocities"". Approximately 500,000 people took refuge in the Vatican during the Nazi occupation of Rome, a large number of which were Jews. The Chief Rabbi of Rome himself was present there. 2 years after the occupation, when Rome was free again, the Chief Rabbi converted to Catholicsm, and took the name Eugenio - Pius XII name. So please, before you spread this erroneous research as truth, CHECK IT!"
1,Even the author discredits this now,"Don't read this book as it has been discredited by its own author:Five years after the publication of Hitler's Pope, Cornwell wrote: ""I would now argue, in the light of the debates and evidence following Hitler's Pope, that Pius XII had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany"" Economist, Dec. 9, 2004.I would actually say that the evidence now available goes much further than this and shows that Pope Pius XII actually played a positive and brave role in trying to defend and protect the Jews. However, whatever you think of that all the contemporary scholarship undermines Cornwell's book now."
1,FILE UNDER FICTION,"Simply this is not scholarship or research, it is propaganda. Mr. Cornwell's allegations really hold no water and are simply a regurgitation of Hockhuth's THE DEPUTY. With this book, and the recent fantasized biography of Ronald Reagan we have entered a whole new era in book publishing, in that by simply getting one's point of view and prejudices published that therefore makes them true. If Pius XII was truly ""Hitler's Pope"" as Mr. Cornwell states, then why did the Nazi regime plan to assasinate the Pope? Enough said."
4,Hitler's Pope: a review,"This is an absorping book that was difficult to put down. I'm looking forward to the sequel,"
1,Trash Masked as History,"There are so many refutations of the poor history in this book that I need not add to them. It might be excusable that the author unintentionally wrote a book besmirching a great man, but evidence contradicts this. Instead, this author deliberately attacked this Pope, and by extension, the Church. What a worm-"
3,Stick to the subject.,"Although I've been a Catholic all my life, I learned a great deal from this book, especially about the World War II years. Basically, I believe the information to be true. Having said this, there is no way any person can possibly know for a fact exactly what is going on in another person's mind. The author loses some of his credibility towards the end of the book when he veers from the main subject. He brings up many liberal ""Catholics"", such as Danial Berrigan, Father Hans Kung, and Charles Curran, as well as single-agenda groups within the church whose goals are in direct contrast to the tenets of the Catholic Church. If these people didn't agree with Church teachings, they should have joined another church."
3,All this and Heaven too!,"As a child growing up in Ireland a neighbour, who held the Catholic Church in low regard, would cry out whenever our pub conversation turned to Catholicism, ""We robbed, raped and plundered but, we never lost the faith."" I smile now though then I winced for you are right Leo, if this book is even remotely accurate.This is the story, written for any age, of an institution morally bankrupt. Led, no, driven by megalomaniac degenerates as to serve no purpose but their own. Evil, by all accounts, has taken residence in Vatican City (who knows when) and it's apologists remain to this day!Though somewhat dry in content and necessarily detailed it is an enjoyable read and a must for all those concerned that our history will be rewritten in C21. If Pious XII is canonised then the Catholic Church will have abandoned any semblance of decency or integrity and deserve nothing but contempt from civil society."
1,It's anti-Catholic pure and simple.,"To grant Cornwell the title of ""Scholar"" is like granting Jimmy Swaggart the title of ""Defender of the Catholic Faith"". By definition, scholars are supposed to be honest, but Cornwell is far from that. He, like many other ""scholars"" before him, excludes the more important information, use information out of context, and then use referenced ""scholars"" incorrect information. This is extremely typical of biased ""scholars"", but they all can be easily refuted by reading other accounts that do have substantial references.Read the accounts written by the Jews if you want the truth. Take note thereafter that anything Cornwell writes is highly suspect to say the least. Omitting pertinent information in a historical account of events is worse than lying to me. To do this with foresight of purpose is to say to the world ""I am a failure as I cannot tell the truth and make my case""."
4,Makes A Case,"The critics and average folk alike don't have access to the Vatican and Jesuit archives. What shocks me is the fact the Vatican allowed his exploration of those texts of recorded history by the 'Roman Catholic Church'. Perhaps, the generation wouldn't care as much as past generations so they were not too worried about it. This book is a must have for those who are students of history..."
1,Cornwell's distortion,John Cornwell presents a portrayal Pius XII which shows his bius against the Catholic Church in general and papal authority in particular. His research has many subtle flaws which will leave many readers bewildered as to the truth surrounding the events of WWII.
1,Anti-Catholicism lives on...,"This book is proof that anti-Catholicsm is the last tolerated bias in today's ""tolerant"" society. Anyone with half of a brain and an open mind can discover that Pope Pius XII was a hero, a man of God who was responsible for saving thousands of Jews from extermination at the hands of one of the 20th century's most evil man, Adolf Hitler. Shame on Cornwell!"
1,Complete utter trash,"How was this allowed to be published? Is there no accountability for lack of research? There is so much wrong with this book that I would recommend ""Hitler the War and the Pope"" for a concise factual rebuttal of this contrived history."
1,lies,"Pius XII saved more lives of Jews than all the Allied forced combined. The World Jewish Congress thanked him for saving over 800,000 Jews from torture and death by the Nazis. This lie stems from a communist play performed in Germany in 1962 called The Deputy. This is a vicious lie about Pope Pius XII and his name and reputation and the truth have suffered very much. Don't read this garbage."
1,Unhistory,"Facts:1-Before his death, the Israeli Philharmonic gave a special concert in Rome to honor Pius XII for saving thousands of Jews from the Nazis.2-The Grand Rabbi of Rome during World War II praised Pius XII for heroically saving Jewish lives from the Nazis.3-At the death of Pius XII, Golda Meir and many other Israeli leaders praised Pius XII as a savior of the Jews.4-After his death, the Israeli government planted 800,000 trees in the Negev as a tribute to the estimated number of Jews saved by Catholic agenices under the direction of Pius XII.Hitler's Pope? No, Hitler's determined enemy."
1,Pius who?,"The odd thing about this book is that it's not about Pius XII and the Shoah at all. The author, an angry ex-Catholic, clearly resents John Paul II and the current state of the Catholic church. To achieve his goals, he has to show that the papacy itself is a corrupt institution, so we're back to poor Pius XII. The technique is easy: suppress all the evidence (quite massive) of Pius XII's efforts to save the Jews, then magnify all the evidence (quite meager) of Pius XII's reticence to speak publicly about the issue. The New York Times, which ran at least 20 articles detailing the Vatican's interventions against the Nazis during World War II, certainly documented no silence.The result is a tirade against Catholicism. Good rhetorical rage, bad history."
1,Garbage disguised as history.,"After reading Cornwell's Hitler's Pope, I decided to do some further reading about Pius XII. From the New York Times, to Time, to Life magazine there were a number of contradictions. Life's photo documentary of Pius' funeral clearly showed Cornwell's disgusting description of the condition of the Pope's body at the time of his funeral to be a lie. Another issue of Life showed the original photo used on the dust jacket and how it had been ""doctored"" to support the scandelous title. I would recommend you read the last chapter first. It will clearly demonstrate Cornwell's primary agenda and that was to engage in rant about the hierarchy of the church and Pope John Paul II. He just uses Pius XII as a means to that end. This is, to quote several other reviewers, ""tabloid journalism masquerading as a scholarly work""."
1,Maybe John Cornwell is the Bigot or a sensationalist,"John Cornwell was not in Rome, not even in Italy from 1935 to 1944. If he were there then he would have needed Hitler's permission. In fact the Facists and Nazi controled not only Rome but the entire country. The Allies didn't free Rome (and the Vatican) until 1944. I was in Italy in 1944 and know that Hitler controlled Rome as he did Greece, and most of Europe. Before Hitler got to Italy His Buddy Mussollini had taken over convents, churches and other Catholic Church properties. To say that Pope Pius X11 could have stopped or impeded Hitler is absolutely rediculous. The Jewish people in Italy and in fact all over the world admired the man. So John Cornwell made himself a few milion dollars condemning a Pope he never knew. He is not a scholar in my mind. He is a sensationalist making a cheap buck and of course he has a right to printing such trash.John"
4,another perspective on the disastrous 30's,"Cornwell makes a strong case that pope-to-be Pacelli inadvertently helped Hitler gain and keep power by silencing Catholic opposition. The book is most disturbing when quoting Pacelli's writings which certainly fulfill any definition of anti-semitism. Pacelli is personally stained by this outrageously unsaintly bigotry, so stained that Cornwell's lack of empathy with the Vatican is almost beside the point. Sadly, many readers will easily equate 'Catholic' and 'fascist' without considering the shocking treatment of priests by leftists in Mexico, Spain, and Russia during civil wars between 1917-37. As Cornwell points out, though, the Nazis could murder Catholic leaders without any real protest from Pacelli (particularly if he considered them opponents). And the notion that crimes of Hitler's magnitude could be committed without comment from the Pope is staggering, even nauseating."
5,Most powerful coporation,"Most excellent history book. It covers only about two chapters on the actuall time of World War 2; but that is because it starts with this man's family history and leads the reader through the history like a history book should.History doesn't just happen it takes time for events to unfold and Cornwell does an exceptial job at telling the STORY in this man's history, proving that he was HITLER'S POPE.The reason for my title, to the review, is the part where the Vatican (vow of poverty?) had around $7 million to ""play"" with in their investments in American corporations (7 million dollars - that's a lot of money in today's terms let alone the 1930's).Excellent for both the Christian and Non-Christian alike, purely nonbiased in the approach!!!!!!!"
5,the most important book on current European history,"The author, a devout Catholic, set out to clear the name of Pius XII. In the secret archives of the Vatican, he found not exoneration, but an astonishing paper trail which identifies Pacelli as a major instigator of both World War I and II.Some reviewers have emphasized Pius XII's hatred of the Jews, but even the most rabid anti-Semite will feel concern about how Pacelli sold out the German Catholics to Hitler. This book is not sensationalism or muck-raking. It has nothing in common with the tawdry gossip and ""as told to"" books which pass fleetingly through the best-seller lists. Professor Cornwell is a careful and diligent researcher and an excellent writer. His book is not anti-religious, and certainly not anti-Catholic. It is for certain a deeply disturbing book, one which will trouble the dreams of both historians and any thoughtful person in today's world. It deserves the widest possible study and discussion."
1,Hitler's Pope,"If I wanted a good read, I certainly wouldn't read this book. It's not fact and certainly not even good fiction. I highly recommend ""Hitler, the War, and the Pope"", by Ronald J. Rychlak, for a much better understanding and a much more fascinating and historically accurate account of the events that took place before and during World War II. Don't let a fuzzy photograph fool you. Find out the truth...if you dare."
1,Polemical ; unscholarly;; :,Truth eventually prevails. But this book is not interested in truth. It was written from a biased point of view and too close to the events in question to be fair.
1,dont be ignorant,"Ignorance amounts to a lack of knowledge.... If one chooses to read this book at least take into consideration reading a book giving the other side of the story. I reccomend ""Hitler, the War, and the Pope"" by Ronald Rychlak. If such a degree of open mindedness is too much to ask (ie. giving both sides unbiased consideration by allowing the accused a chance to defend itself with a book of its own) then at least one should take into account a small spattering of the information conveyed in this book.... one can listen to a real audio stream of a radio show where the author of ""Hitler, the war, and the Pope"" talks a little about his book, the url is http://www.catholic.com/radio/shows/2001/ca010111.ram It's free and will take much less time to listen to than the time probably already invested in reading the other side of the debate."
1,Out of date already,"This book was first published less than two years ago, and it has already been thoroughly refuted time and again by far more credible authorities and scholars. In contrast, what scholar has come to Cornwell's aid? They say time has an uncanny ability to separate truth from fiction, but it is remarkable how fast it has happened here. At this point, buy the better sources that have followed Cornwell if you are interested in the facts."
4,Well researched and it shows that religious bureaucracies are like any other bureaucracy.,"The judgment of history usually involves matching historical events with the background provided by primary sources; i.e. documents. That is what Cornwell attempts to do in this book. Documents alone are subject to the reader's interpretation but when matched with the events can present a compelling argument for the author's thesis. Cornwell makes a complelling case that Eugenio Pacelli's negotiations with Hitler were about preserving Vatican control over those things, the Vatican wanted to control. The net effect of his actions was to ""grease the gears"" for Hitler to attain almost absolute power. IAfter he became pope, Pacelli's role became that of preserving those gains the church bureaucracy had consolidated. I think that attempt stained his place in history. Cornwell's use of Vatican documents highlight those stains. It's a sad commentary."
1,Forced and distorted analysis,"Claiming to have discovered never before seen documents attesting to Pius XII's early anti-semitism, which would explain his less than forthright defense of the Jews pursued by Nazi killers, Cornwell actually finds nothing about Pius' anti-semitism which is not forced and distorted in his hands. He does indeed contribute something important in documenting Pius'desire to centralize the Catholic church even more than it was. He also documents the unfortunate Vatican weakening of the German Center Party in the last days of the Weimar Republic and the first days of Hitler's regime. But this does not compensate for his vitriolic attack on Pius whose major fault (a real fault in a Pope, perhaps) was being more of a diplomat than a pastor of souls."
1,Trash,"I couldn't finish it. Simply awful. The author in his early 90s autobiography describes how he completely lost his faith. It shows. His animosity towards the papacy is unsupported and vicious. Full of gratuitous assertions that don't begin to make a legitimate case. Lord knows, there have problematic popes, but this screed entirely misses the mark."
1,Worse Book Of The Year,"This book is terrible, his research is so fabricated that it is almost unreal. It is amazing that a person like this author who apparently has a giant resentment going against the Catholic Church can even get published."
1,rmh,Incredible fabrications masquerading as history. The author had an axe to grind or was demon posessed. True psuedo history.
2,What About Vatican II???,"In the tsk, tsk being thrown on Pope Pius XII by this author, I'm amazed that he never discusses the complete absence of any condemnation of Communism by the bishops at Vatican II.Given that the initial Vatican II documents contained such a condemnation of Communism and given the widespread persecution and mass murder of Christians by communist regimes in Eastern Europe and China (in much larger numbers than any of Hitler's mass murders) during this time period, the ultimate decision to omit any reference to Communism from the Vatican II documents dwarfs any lapse of duty Pope Pius XII might have committed.The failure of any of Pope Pius XII's critics to address this second betrayal at Vatican II should give objective readers pause to consider just where these critics sympathies lie."
1,Poor Scholarship,"Cornwell is neither a scholar nor a historian. He completely ignores facts, documents, and the writings of even leading Jewish contemporaries of Pius XII. Cornwell greatly exaggerates his use of Vatican files. Even the photo on the book jacket is incorrectly attributed to the time of Hitler; in fact it was from the 1920's when Pacelli was a papal nuncio to Germany, well before Hitler came to power. The soldier is a Weimar soldier, not a Nazi.One can argue whether or not Pope Pius XII could have been more outspoken, but Cornwell's lack of scholarship and ethical research is inarguable and inexcusable.Viking Press should be ashamed of themselves for publishing this trash.Those who have reviewed this book and praised it should do a little more research yourselves."
1,"Questionable History, Questionable Conclusion","In his six volume history, The Second World War, Sir Winston Churchill never once mentioned the Holocaust against the Jews. Nothing about gas chambers, not a word about genocide.Yet we know that Europe's Jewish leaders provided Churchill with substantial materials on the war against them. After the war ended, Chaim Weizmann wrote to Churchill asking why he had been silent on the matter. He had no reply.What should we conclude from this fact? That Churchill did nothing to help Europe's Jews?That conclusion would be, prima facie, frivolous.Likewise are Cornwell's conclusions about Pope Piux XII."
1,Anti-catholic propaganda contradicted by NYRB article.,"Completely contradicted by Columbia University Jewish historian's (specialist in Jewish history of the period) evaluation of Pius XII in ""Catholics, Jews, and the Holocaust,"" in the New York Review of Books around the time of the convent controversy. The author goes on to describe the official Lutheran church support of Hitler and states that more Catholic nuns and priest died and went to prison for the Jews than any other religious group. Am retrieving article and citation for you. I also have personal knowledge of the Pontifical Biblical Institute's life-risking cooperation with the Dutch resistance in the succesful effort to disseminate abroad documentation of the nazi atrocities. 0 is my rating of the book!"
1,Why are no favorable books or articles considered?,"Cornwell's book is a slick effort to defame a Pope who risked everything to hide Jews in Roman monasteries and actually saved thousands.As a guest of the trappist monastary Tre Fontane (Easter 1955)I noticed an obilisk in one of the courtyards. It was covered with Jewish names. The monk in charge of the guests explained to me that the stucture was a gift sent by Jews who had been hidden in the monastary during W.W.II and so escaped deportation to concentration camps.Sr. M. Marchione's books present similar evidence in favor of Pius XII. Why do the ""negative"" writers never consider it?"
1,Cornwall Recants,"It may be of interest to note that author Cornwell himself now says the following: ""I would now argue, in the light of the debates and evidence following Hitler's Pope, that Pius XII had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by the Germans."" This must be kept in mind while reading this unbalanced book."
1,Poor Scholarship,"...Cornwell jumps around trying to prove his adjenda, often attempting to run together completely unreleated events. Cornwell's reference to a Pius quote, a Jew with ""pale, dirty, with drugged eyes"" is a remark that the pope made about one particular Bolshevik; it was not a sweeping generalization about Jews...The soldier pictured on the right is not even a Nazi soldier. For a much better account of what the archives contain, ""Pius XII and the Second World War"" by Pierre Blet comes much more highly recommended. END"
3,Good Start Freezes,"Initially I was more than happy with this machine, it worked well and was simple to use. I added the Australian maps for a trip down under. The machine worked well for the first 45 minutes there and then it froze and turned itself off. I reset, but within a few minutes it froze again. This was repeated a number of times until it simply would not start and came up with an error. Tom Tom in Australia were most unhelpful, and I was forced to buy hard copy maps to get around. I have returned home now but the problem is still unresolved. I keep hoping that one day I will be able to again use my expensive piece of equipment!!"
2,Where's Bobby?,"I bought this CD to hear Bobby McFerrin mess with Mozart. There is a sum total of about two minutes of The Divine Mr. Mc., and the rest is Chick Corea sturdily plowing through Mozart. Very disappointing. If I wanted a CD of some not-terribly-daring Mozart, I would have bought a recording from someone who is known for his or her classical abilities. It's pleasant background music, but that's about it."
1,Couldn't be more disapointing....,I wanted McFerrin singing Mozart but I got almost pure Mozart instead. Bobby had to be the main dish not a tiny apetizer. It is classical music CD with negligible traces of Corea's and McFerrin's jazz. Very weird!
5,innovative improvisations on Mozart,I ordered this CD after hearing a review on NPR & am VERY pleased with it. I'm sure Wolfie would approve the McFerrin vocal preludes & the many new Corea improvizations on the cadenzas. I recommend this recording for all forward-thinking music lovers! It is splendid!
1,"Sound of horn? No, Bad trombone......Needs to be Fired.","Clevenger has a Trumpet/Trombone sound on the French Horn. He is an insult to American Horn players and needs to quit(or get fired) from his Principal position of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Besides ruining hundreds of horn students, he promotes lackluster section playing and degrades the sound of American orchestras with his teaching. The CSO horn section also sounds horriable under his control."
5,What a HOOT!,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my friend, and what a HOOT (and a hit) it was..not only for her, but for me (Naturally, I had to check it out first) and her mother and other friends as well. This is one of those gifts that you don't want to write in because you'll want to pass it on. GREAT idea!"
1,Reboots itself,"This product reboots itself every 5-10 minutes, breaking all connections. I RMA'ed the first one, thinking it was defective, but the second we received exhibited the exact same behavior. D-Link support was not helpful at all, suggesting our individual product is defective even after I explained that the first did the same thing."
3,"For the price, yes!","I would rate this good, for the price you paid for. Good for your home with 2 internet connections. Of course, do not compare this with commercial grade Cisco or Zyxel Dual WAN, you pay thousands versus this which cost a little over 100. It's worth the money you paid for. tech-r-us.com"
1,VPN passthrough not working correctly,"I got this router to hook up to both a cable and DSL uplink. Unfortunately, in spite of extended tinkering with the router's settings I could not connect from my laptop to the VPN at work. With my old Linksys WRT54G this worked fine out of the box. BTW, this was with only a single uplink hooked up.I also tried this with the Xincom XC-DPG502, same problem. I am planning to try the Draytek 2910 next."
2,Not much of a yarn,Having read other books by this author I ordered this one and was unable to get through it. I would not give to a friend. I usually give a book 50 pages to start. If after that I am not interested I move on. I gave this Yarn 100 pages before I put it down forever.
3,Nice when it works =/,"It was nice for the first few weeks then it got jammed up and now it's not working. It was a little expensive, I believe I got one for about 3 bucks, so I was disappointed when I couldn't use it anymore. Overall it was easy to use and does it job well, so 3 stars for it."
5,Don't Be Home Without It,This is a terric product. It is easy to use and sure makes correcting mistakes a snap. It seems to last forever and there is no lumping or caking that you get with the liquid white-out. The application device also makes it easy to isolate what needs to be corrected.
1,Question,"The picture in Target shows 6 rolls and the price seems to reflect 6 rolls; however, no where does it indicate anything other than 1 item. Is is 1 item, a box of 6 rolls? Did not order. Did not want to pay $20 for 1 roll. Would like to order if I only knew what was being sold.Thomas"
4,very good,"Basically a very good product. If, however, you hoped you could use the tape for its Post-it qualities-- to temporarily mask something with the intent of removing the tape later-- beware that it does leave a little bit of sticky residue. I have found I can remove the residue with an pencil eraser."
5,Old fashion romance,"Out of Time is the companion to Both Sides of Time. Annie Lockwood is back with another adventure back in Time. This time her falling takes place in New York City where she and Strat meet again. Now that Strat and Harriett are married, Annie doesn't think she has much of a chance with Strat anymore. With Harriett sick with Consumption, Strat ends up investing more of his time in Annie. He is the only one who believes that she traveled 100 years from the future, and that triggers a very shocking reaction from his father. His father admits him to an asylum! Can Annie save her beloved Strat and keep her already shambled family together?This is a great series for anyone who adores the old-fashioned ways of courtship and wind-swept romances. The characters are so believable that even I thought I was trapped in Time.Carisa @ MyShelf.Com"
1,sequels r never as good!,"this book is a disgrace 2 the first. i don't know why caroline b cooney decided to write it... or publish it for that matter. it is in-comprehensible and the ending is just an encore of the first! if you have read the first book and are want 2 read the sequel, forget it."
3,Love Lost in Time,"This book was not as good as the last Caroline Cooney book that I have read. It was a little slow in the beginning to get to the transfer through time. You have to be in an old time word and phrase state of mind or you won't understand what they are talking about in the book. It is a love story and an adventure story all in one. A girl had traveled back in time inadvertently and had fallen in love with a boy. Then she had traveled back to her own time again. Now she must go back. Her one true love is in trouble and she is the only one who can help him. Now it is a strugal for survival and love. If you are not into love stories I wouldn't recommend this book, but if you are into love stories, then this is a book for you."
4,"""Out of Time""","This book was really good! I bought it because I read the first one and I ABSOLUTELY needed to know what happened! This book fits into so many categories including romance (of course!!!), suspense, fantasy, and many more that I can't think of at the moment! you feel so many emotions too like sadness, happiness, jealousy, bitterness, anxiousness, excitement, and of course, the feeling of butterflies in your stomach.I picked this book up and started to read, and I couldn't put it down! It was that good! With every page you read, you just have to know what happens next. The ending is really well written, but leaves you wanting to find out more, even if it wasn't even a cliffhanger as much as the first book had been. READ THIS BOOK (after you've read the first one, of course)!!!"
5,"Not as Good as the First One, But Still a Great Story","After reading Both Sides of Time, I was more than ready to read the sequal. But, I was a bit disappointed. The book was good, but not quite as good as the first one. It took a little while to get going, and was hard to follow at times. Still, I am ready and waiting for Prisoner of Time to come out. Ms. Cooney is an excellent writer and I feel that it will be as good, if not better than, the other two!"
2,waste of time,"I have read many of Caroline B. Cooney's books, and this, is not what I would showcase as her best. The characters and situations were sort of thrown at the reader, and little background was given. You were just supposed to feel what the emotions of the characters were on your own.She did compare the ideals of the present day to the past frequently. Annie, the main character, wants to live in the past because she would have less responsobilties, but at the same time wants woman rights. I think this shows how much society has changed.Unfortunatley, I don't believe she was going after politcal views, but where her true focus was is still kind of blurry. Her descriptions were vague, and characters were sort of tossed around like salad condiments. Throwing in scenes here and there, just overall making it confusing and uninteresting."
4,No Time Like the Present..,"I have not read the others in the series but this one's truly great! About a boy from the past,imprisoned in a mental institution because of his talk of time-travel,and the girl born a hundred or so years later,who is in love with him and will once again travel the distances of time, to free him."
4,This book was awesome!!!!!!,"Out of Time was so good that when i was supposed to go to bed i would sneak in an extra chapter or two. I love how Cooney writes her books and how she goes in to such detail. I am about to start Both Sides of Time, and if it is as good as this book it will be a #1 book."
5,A great ending to a great romance.,This book was fantastic!! I have to admit that I didn't expect it to be so good. Caroline B. Cooney: Keep up the good work!
5,annie travels in time to save the man she loves,the book was awesome. i loved it i couldn't put it down for 1 second until i finished it. i never knew it had a first part and a second but now i am going to buy them. i can't wait to read them. the book was sentimental and captivating. i loved it.
5,A GREAT NAIL BITTING SEQUEL,This book was as good as the first. I loved how that little simple design came up and you could see what was happening with everybody. The ending closed the series even though I wish there were more about Strat and Annie in the Prisoner of Time but really Devonny and Tod didn't have a big part in Out of Time. So it's okay with me.
3,I was sorely disappointed!,"""Out of Time"" was not at all what I expected and I was very disappointed. The story was very unfulfilling and I was left with this feeling that I missed 100 pages somehow. The beginning was very jumbled and I couldn't figure out where Cooney was going. I thought ""Out of Time"" would pick up *right* where ""Both Sides of Time"" left off - with Annie in that tornado tunnel type thing. Everything good about ""Both Sides of Time"" was left out of ""Out of Time."" Nothing was accomplished in this novel but frustration! Nevertheless, I'll be reading the sequel to this. I do not recommend."
2,Not worked as expected,It was only good for 2 months. Later it stopped working. I had to throw this as a junk item.
3,Questionable test results,"I purchased this cuff to speed up the process of taking multiple blood pressure readings on a daily basis. I have found that the readings have a bit lower, up to 10 psi, than my regular cuff. I am not sure I would recommend this cuff to anyone who is closely monitoring their blood pressure."
5,Mabis 04-228-001 SmartRead Deluxe Automatic Wrist Digital Blood Pressure Monitor,"Instructions for use of monitor are clear and simple. Monitor is very easy to use. I have used this monitor at least twice daily since I have gotten it and have had no problems with it. I have checked for accuracy by doing the standard arm type blood pressure readings, and this monitor has maintained its accuracy. I am very pleased with this monitor, and was very pleased with the price, as other monitors of this type usually sell for much more."
1,LCD problems,"LCD date display only shows partial numbers, so I can't program the date. LCD time display only shows partial numbers, so I can't program the time. After taking my blood pressure, the systolic LCD display does not show up at all. Diastolic and pulse LCD displays only show partial numbers, so I can't read it. Can't vouch for the accuracy of the product because I CAN'T READ THE OUTPUT! Mabis requires me to send them $5 if I send them the product for replacement/repair. Other reviewers with similar complaints indicate lack of response from the company. jeez."
3,MABIS SmartRead (wrist blood pressure raader),I have owned the MABIS SmartReader for about six weeks. I have found it to be very inconsistent in readings taken at the same time. I took the unit to my doctor's off and he compared it with reading taken on a standard mercury column blood pressure unit. The SmartReader readings varied as much as five to 25 points each instance. The doctor suggested that the unit be calibrated. There is no process for accomplishing a calibration in the instruction book. How may I have the unit calibrated?Another question: How may the rhe two memory banks be cleared in order to start a new record series?
1,Faulty LCD,Both my original and replacement purchases of this item had faulty LCD's which rendered them unuseable. It was too much a hassle to continue the attempt to purchase one in working order. I was very disappointed in this worthless product.
2,NOT FOR MEN,"I BOUGHT THIS AS A VALENTINE ""HEART"" PRESENT FOR MY HUSBAND SO HE COULD CHECK HIS BLOOD PRESSURE THROUGHOUT THE WINTER WITHOUT HAVING TO UNDRESS TO FIND HIS ARM. THE WRIST CUFF IS WAY TOO SMALL FOR A MAN. SO UNLESS YOU ARE PURCHASING FOR A WOMAN, I DON'T RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE ELSE."
2,"Great product, poor price.",Buy this and many other sizes somewhere else for a better price. High shear strength lags with corrosion resistant coating requires no pre-drilling.
5,Bobby Blue Bland - Definitive Collection,"It was a thrill to listen to this album and hear the golden pipes of the greatBobby ""Blue"" Bland. Even though the quality of his back up group was a productof acoustics of that time, Bland's rich voice is never diminished and sounds superb. He reallyhits his stride in songs #11 through #16 with classics ""Turn on Your Love Light"",""Call on Me"", ""Ain't Nothing You Can Do"", and the beautiful ""Share Your Love WithMe"" accompanied with quality backup singers and strings. The brassy sound and the strings were particularly good in such songs as ""Don't Cry No More"" and ""Turn on Your Love Light"".This album is a nice way to meet Bobby Bland or to remember him."
3,Bobby Blue Bland-Dedfinitive Collection,"I bought this because I am a blues fan as well as a blues musician.I like having the original versions of songs. The CD is worth the few well known Bobby Bland songs such as ""Further Down the Road"", ""I Smell Trouble"" and ""Stormy Monday""but most of it was mellow R&B ballads. I've seen Bobby live and admire him as one of the ""original"" but this is not the CD I would recommend to introduce someone to the blues."
5,"Very interesting reading, insight into dancer","I enjoyed reading this book very much. It shows many different sides of Martha Graham, and how she interacted with other dancers. If you're interested in her life, her autobiography is also great reading."
5,"Office Survival Guide -- Very, Very Helpful Advice","This book is filled with the kind of insights and advice that anyone who is trying to thrive -- not just survive -- in a 21st-century office environment can begin putting to use immediately. The suggestions and ideas contained within are real-world, nuts-and-bolts tools that help avoid problems, resolve issues, and build the kind of consensus that will allow you and your whole team to move forward. Today, more than ever, interpersonal skills are an essential component of business success. Without them, your career can be over before it begins. Ironically, however, we all seem to get less training and less preparation in this vital area than ever before. This book can help close that gap. Put it on the bookshelf where you keep the essential volumes that you come back to over and over again."
3,Great buy but pricey.,I give 3 stars because its expensive buy for a bunch of wires but it gets the job done. This connector easy to install then the hard wire connectors. Directions very clear and easy to follow. You can probably find cheaper at dealership or at uhaul.
3,In the Paray school,"What Salonen is doing here is playing Debussy as he should be played--immaculately with pointillistic color and no slush. Obviously he is a disciple of the great Paul Paray who knew Debussy particularly well and whose own recordings are legendary and very much available to you.The difference, then, is one of experience. Whereas Paray rises to perfectly controlled power, Salonen lets go with a lot of noise and clatter. Yes, he has the right idea, but the LA Phil gets away from him and he has a mighty hard time quieting things down below mezzo-forte when called for. Still, I'd rather listen to Salonen get the right idea than most of the flotsam that's washed up on recorded Debussy shores.Salonen will probably remake this again, just give him some time--check back in 20. In the meantime, stick with all the Debussy offered by Mercury with Paul Paray and the Detroit Symphony, THE revelatory combination to be reckoned with in this and lots of other material."
2,Enervated Debussy in amazing sound,"Salonen and the L.A. Phil. have been making a series of sonically spectacular 20-bit recordings (most of them needing corporate subsidy since they don't sell very well, even in L.A.) For this recording of Debussy staples the orchestra went to the Todd A-O studio in Hollywood, and the result is a fantastically detailed soundscape with enticing clarity and great impact.Musically, however, I found little to appreciate. For Salonen, who models himslf as a post-modern conductor, it goes without saying that deep expressiveness and romanticism are taboo. But here he seems to think that Debussy is a stylistic zero. Aside from precise articulation, this music has nothing to say. Salonen's tempos are slow on the whole, but more than that they are shapeless. Events follow one another without any apparent joy or enthusiasm. So for me this was a Clockwork Orange kind of experience--hip, empty, and apathetic."
5,Garbage James Bond,"""The World Is Not Enough"" is a great single and is noteworthy for Garbage and Bond fans alike. It's great to hear the UNKLE Remix version of this song, which gives it a whole new slant. The Original Version is on here a well.The David Arnold's ""Ice Bandits"" an instrumental track based on the same tune was unnecessary and inappropriate. It is the same as the cut on the soundtrack.The cover artwork based on the teaser poster for ""The World Is Not Enough"" is very good. Every BOND FAN should add this to their collection."
5,Garbage iz da best,it's all in this c.d the world is not enough one of their best song this is the c.d you want if you are a garbage fan the song is good and the video is good shirley manson looks hella fine in every video if i was you i would pick this c.d
3,Not much detail,The book is not indexed nor are the dances and rituals well explained. I was hoping for something more detailed.Gerald Ferguson
1,"Old Fashioned, Boring, Waste of Money, Terrible","My 2-year old daughter got ""Mickey Saves Santa"" DVD for her birthday and absolutely loves it. I purchased this DVD thinking it would be similar, but no! Mickey's Around the World in 80 days looks like it was produced 30 years ago - very old fashioned animation and the 'educational' aspect is also very dated. I give this 1 star because my 2-year old would not watch it at all despite it saying it is appropriate for 2-6 year olds. An older child may find it more interesting. It seems to me that Disney is re-hashing old material and packaging it in a new box. Skip this DVD and get ""Mickey Saves Santa"" which is highly appropriate for a preschooler, with up-to-date animation and 3 wonderful interactive stories."
2,Overpriced,"Hitting in an ""educational"" DVD! Disney please stop!!! What ""leading educators"" reviewed this and shame on them!Recycled cartoons interspersed with very few questions/learning facts, done in cheap animation. Cheap pop up Mickey pops up on world map saying hello/goodbye is the education highlight. Other than that they pause the cartoon and ask a few boring questions. My son was bored as he kept looking for animated Mickey. The 80Days cartoon is ok, but I didn't purchase a ""cartoon"" I purchased an Educational DVD. Disney does not have the ""magic"" of teaching."
5,A Fantastic Birdbath,"We purchased this birdbath last winter but waited to give our review to see how it worked in very cold weather. Well, we are very, very pleased. The water remained lukewarm during our coldest snap. No ice at all. The size accommodates all size birds and a variety of little critters. The scalloped edges are perfect for even the smallest birds to hold onto. Changing the water is a snap. It unscrews with ease and we just dump the old water off the side. The clamps hook solidly on our deck railing and holds the birdbath good and steady. This birdbath is well worth the money. This is our 2nd season and it still looks just like new. Our birdbath must be the talk of bird town because it is always busy, many birds sharing together and others waiting their turn. Such fun!!! AAA++++"
2,Shoddy Packing,"I received this item in just the original box with most of the pieces missing since neither end was taped securely. They did send me a new one but it was a hassle to have deal with all of that.The unit itself is much larger and cumbersome than I expected and so we have yet to set it up on our deck since I think it is going to stick out like a sore thumb. If you are going to purchase the base and use it that way I think it would look much nicer, unfortunately we live in a condo complex and are not allowed to do that.The item itself seems well made but since we have not actually got it running yet I am not sure how it will function. I will write with an update!"
1,Don't bother,"My son had no interest in this toy except to remove the doggie rattle and shake/chew it. I though it would be great for the car, but it is only interesting to a very young baby (and even then my son found it boring) and unless you have the car seat with the overhead pull down bar, you have to attach this to the car seat straps EVERY time before you go out. In addition, the strap secures are not very secure and if you were in an accident, it would be a potentially heavy projectile. Not enough to do to stay entertained. I had high hopes for this product, especially since you can remotely activate it and I though he would be able to play with it, but there really is nothing to play with, just mainly stare at and then it was not that interesting. Save your money."
1,Not worth the money,"This toy looked like a great idea although my child never really liked playing with it. The cover is not removable and can not be cleaned other than wiped down, which is not a good idea for babies. I would not recommend this purchase."
3,Wish it did more.,"I got this toy for my son when he out grew his infant carrier carseat at 6 months. The toys that hung on his old carseat didn't work on his new one so I needed a new toy. I thought it would be cute for him to ""drive"" and I like the idea of a remote to turn the toy off when he fell asleep. The idea for this toy is great, I just wish it did more. It plays music and flashes lights and that's about it. I also could never get it to secure to the car seat so it sat on his lap. He is not that interested in it anymore."
2,not really worth it,This toy was not worth the money and it's SO annoying! My son was never really interested in this toy.
2,Glad I didn't buy it.,This was a gift from a family friend. It din't attach to the carseat properly therefore placing it on my daughters laps just made her mad and she would kick it into the floor. I DID like the remote....when it worked. And the music...well...could of been better.
3,nice idea needs some work,"I bought this item because my daughter often got bored in her car seat. I thought this might keep her occupied. The concept is a good idea, but the toy needs some work. I found it hard to attach to her carseat, and the link and key are on the same side of the toy so she gets the entangled often. The parent control is great when she has trouble getting it to play music, but it does not fit on my visor."
2,My son got bored after a couple minutes.,I bought it for my son thinking he would like it. Wrong. It is a pain to try to attach it to his car seat. When I finally got it attached he just tried to kick it off. Now it is somewhere in my house collecting dust.
5,This won't be my last.,"I was first attracted to this book because of the cover. It's absolutely gorgeous. I really liked the way Annette Blair developed the characters. The love between Gideon and Sabrina kept me turning the pages, because there was so much intimacy between them. I fell in love with the way Sabrina was viewed through the eyes of Gideon. I'm not a man, but the love was described so well, I could ""see"" it. Undeniable Rogue was a wonderful love story. Tender, passionate, and realistic. I'll definitely read the others."
4,I liked it,"I can't explain why I liked this book so much. The author did a great job of showing the importance of family and showing how the hero really was a decent guy even though Sabrina treated him like a blank check. You kind of know how the end will play out but the added twist of the creepy guy hanging out around the house and the kidnapping added some intrigue.Was it very realistic? Probably not, but it was definitely a fun book to read. From what I've read, it was not common during that time for another man to literally walk into a pregnant widow's life and offer to take care of her and her baby."
3,Just OK,"SPOILERS :::::I love romance but this was just ok. I really don't understand what all the 5 stars are all about. Rogue Dukes don't usually fall so easily and/or marry just anyone without a fight,so this was strange for me. Sabrina was getting on my nerves with her distrust after ALL Gideon did for her.She is preganat he's ok with, she has kids already he's ok with and she won't have sex with him and he's ok with it .OMG! Their feelings were written well but to much information ""constantly"". And the evil guy was in and out. What was the point? I'm not sure if book 2 is for me. 3 stars for me because of the price for what you get. And I was disappointed because I fell for the 5 stars. If your a hard core Romance (HIS.)reader you may not ""LOVE IT"" as much as every other viewer did."
5,Undeniable Rogue,I have read other books from this Author. The Kitchen Witch. I can't help but fall in love with her Heroins. Absolutly brings them to life. So Much so. I wish they would walk in to my real life. That's some gifted writing. Gerard Labrecque
2,FOUND HEROINE UNLIKABLE---,"It's hard to enjoy a book when you don't enjoy the heroine. If the author had shown the heroine's hard life up front, instead of dribbling it out along the way, I might have felt more compassion for her. As it was, I found the fact that she began her marriage by wanting to take everything she needed from it without considering her too-good-to-be-real new husband's needs selfish beyond extreme. She was lucky-as-heck to even find someone to marry her (and her household) while throughout the book she remained non trusting and non truthful . Actually, I did not see much difference between her and the conniving mistress. The husband's, Demon/Rapscallions', and pets' humor saved this from being a total loss."
5,Great Love Story with a lot of heart,"I wont recap what tohers have written before,however I did want to say this was by far one of the best free kindle books I ever downloaded and I look forward to reading further in the series. Very well written!"
3,not that great,I'm amazed at all the 5 star reviews. This book was just not that good. An unbelievable hero who is too good to be true falls in love with a heavily pregnant woman at first sight!! I don't think so.
4,Enjoyed,I enjoyed reading this book. It started off great. I almost wished the heroes true identity was left a secret from the heroine a little longer than what it was. However I completely fell in love with him. I wont lie it was a little unbelievable because he was a rogue turned overnight.. it gets a little mushy in the book too. But over all I enjoyed the story and the expert to book two.
3,Not What Hyped Up To Be,"With all of the 5 star reviews, I was expecting cohesive writing, interesting characters and fabulous dialogue and did not find it in this book. This book was an average free kindle romance book in terms of writing style and plot. It was worth the free download."
1,undeniably bad,i found this book incredibly disappointing especially after reading all the rave reviews. the story just became too boring and the characters were way too annoying. i dont get what all the fuss was about.
5,easy fun read,"This story has all the characteristics of its genre but still adds a twist of its own. Expect all the usual characters; animals, children and a motley assortment.It is an easy and fun read. The next time I want to read a regency romance I will look for the second in the series."
1,Undeniably bad,"Obviously, I'm in the minority, but this book was achingly bad. The writing was plodding and predictable, and I felt no connection to the characters. Despite being free, it was a waste of my time."
5,Starting at Happily Ever After,"This is my new favorite regency romance! I love the fact that it starts with happily ever after instead of ending there! It's a beautiful story of how two sincere people with abusive pasts learn to trust and love each other. The author is skilled at ""showing"" rather than ""telling"" and her literary techniques really set the moods. Love is a verb...if you give it to others and set it free, it will fly back to you. I fell in love with the characters because their feelings and behaviors were so authentic and real. Throw in a couple of steamy scenes in the marriage bed (including some without intercourse because of Gideon's promise) and a really slimy bad guy, and you've got the perfect book! I will be reading more by this author."
1,Worst book EVER!!!,"I purchased this book based on the reviews and because I have read and enjoyed Annette Blair books in the past (witch series). If I could give ""minus"" stars I would!!! I have never been so thoroughly disappointed with a book! I felt like I was reading the same chapter over and over. I disliked both the hero (Gideon--the obsession with pregnancy and nursing--too creepy) and the heroine (Sabrina--what a money grubbing b****). I certainly DO NOT plan on wasting any more money on the rest of this series of books!!!"
4,Undeniiable Rogue,"This is a very interesting tale and is very well-written.It would have earned five stars except, in my opinion, any tale having to use such detailed intimacy doesn't deserve five stars. Some of story alluded to the intimacies without graphic detail. All of them could have been this way. I feel, a truly great author can excite and create an illusion verbally without intimate detail."
5,Very Good,"I am not normally a romance reader, thinking the characters generally lack comman sense, but I read the reviews and gave it a go. I was hooked from the onset. I really liked the characters and cared for them. It had good sensual scenes without being too graphic. It also contained characters with morality and principles and I will gladly purchase any following books in the series."
4,A good read,The beginning was a little rough to start but immediately I fell in like with the characters. I would recommend it to any romance enthusiast and mother.
5,Funny!,I really enjoyed this book & can't wait to start reading book two!!!!! Thank you very much!!!! God Bless You.
1,One of the worst ever!,"I only downloaded this because it was free and struggled to finish it. It really was one of the worst romances I have ever read. I am a fan of rakes and rogues and I expected the hero to be a rogue. He was not a rogue, he was a milquetoast weakling, and that was a turnoff. The opening scene when he falls for her reads unrealistic in the extreme. The characters were not fully fleshed out and the story was flat because of it. I didn't want them to end up together. I wanted the hero to grow a spine and ditch the wretched heroine for someone more deserving of his protection and kindness. However, not before years of therapy and self esteem seminars. I will not be continuing this trilogy."
2,Undeniably Bad,"First, I'd like to vent for a moment about the title ""Undeniable Rogue."" That title leads you to believe that the hero will be a rogue of some sort. Hardly. He's not nearly that exciting.I found the whole premise of this book unbelievable. Furthermore, every exchange between the H/h seems to be motivated by lust. While that's not necessarily bad thing if some other connection between the H/h exists (see Madeline Hunter's books for example), when it appears to be the ONLY connection between the H/h, then there's a problem.Unfortunately, that's all that I can really remember about this book, which I only read a few days ago. That, I'm afraid, says more about the quality of ""Undeniable Rogue"" than anything else I could write."
2,Could have been good,"I was extremely bored with this book. It sounded so promising and based on so many excellent reviews I could not believe it was just that bad. Things were downplayed that should have been elaborated on such as how much she was abused, yes it was mentioned but not to the point that you could relate to why she acted like a selfish greedy intolerable person. I was sick of them whining over each other pretty early on in the book. The plot was there which is why I gave it a 2. I won't be reading the rest of the series."
1,A free book not worth the price,"If you've come here because you love Austin, or Heyer, SKIP THIS BOOK! At 50% I realized it was without hope, by 65% I was reading every 5th sentence. It reminds me most of the diary of a teenage girl, incapable of realistically portraying people with thoughts other than what she wishes. The hero is nothing except what the heroine wants most, and she's so obnoxiously self-absorbed she can't see or appreciate it. A hollow, fluffy bit of saccharine that leaves an acrid taste. Don't bother."
1,"dreadful, amateurish","To say that this is dreadful, amateurish writing gives it more praise than it deserves.The main characters are both totally unbelievable. The initial premise is good (the first few paragraphs and as far as I got in the rest of the book before giving up seem like they were written by two different people, one talented and one not.)I'm returning this to Amazon even though it cost 0 dollars, to make a point,"
4,Wish there were more clubs like the Rogues Club,"I was touched by the idea that a group of soldiers would promise to care for one another's families in the event they didn't survive the battle. Gideon honorably kept a promise, which led, of course, to much happiness with Sabrina. I enjoyed it."
5,A hero to die for!,"I loved it!!! The characters were wonderful. Some scenes warmed my heart, others made me laugh. The sexual tension between Sabrina and Gideon sizzled, and the children were adorable. In my opinion, any man who's willing to take on a ready-made family is a hero is to die for!I couldn't put it down.Thanks, Annette for a great read. I'll looking forward to the next book in your Rogue series."
2,Couldn't complete it.,"I tried, I really did. I read some of the reviews after giving up on this story and really wish I could read it.Maybe if I had it in paperback where I could flip-through the pages and get past all the unrealistic fondling of a women with two kids, one on the way and who was supposedly abused by someone.This women isn't going to fall in bed eight-months pregnant and innocently grasp his, well you know, and ask him if she can help and then act like she doesn't know what she's doing. I mean please.I hate when they come out of the 'holding pen'(first few chapters) already physically familiar with each other when they don't even know one another.As far as grammar and punctuation; I personally don't care unless it's a story set back in the days of the knights and someone pops off with 'Do ya think' or 'that's really cool'. I have come across some like that.Well, back to the book list."
3,Undeniable Rogue,"The book,Undeniable Rogue is a good book. I enjoyed reading it. It is worth reading. I finished it in two days."
3,Ok but predictable,The story line was good. Not enough of Ronnie to make it believable. Not difficult to put down and not go back to for a couple of days.
4,Couldn't put it down,"I love good historical romance books and chose this one just from the cover picture. I'm happy to say it was all I hoped it would be. ""I have read it twice!"" For all who enjoy a good love story with lots of excitement and a good ending, I highly recommend this one."
3,Interesting,"It flows and it will keep you reading. It had an interesting tale spin, just enough to make you want to keep reading it."
3,First time reader of this author,Book is OK. The story flows but there is some stretch to the way why the Duke sticks to his promise of marrying a pregnant woman that he knows nothing about.
4,Well written book,Enjoyable book. Not too long. Interesting story line and characters. I didn'tt want to put it down so I read it quickly.
4,good CD,This is a good way to fill out your collection with these works. The recording quality is good -- occasionally favoring the piano soloists a bit too much. The piano is so closely recorded in fact that I frequently heard creaking noises that I suspect might have been the pianist's weight shifting on his bench! Recommended if you don't already have the Gershwin or Falla. The Faure was my favorite but it is less of an essential piece to have in your collection.
1,French pop from the 70's,"I purchased this album during a severe attack of nostalgia and regretted it immediately! Every songs is performed the same way: starts out nice and quiet and then builds to a screaming cacophony of noise. It might help if you understand French, which I don't. You can buy my copy for very little!"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this fiction attempt by Agnes Keith. Sexually suggestive at times, hard to separate her own life story from this made-up heroine. Adds more insight to the Indonesian area, but not anything I wanted more details about."
3,CZ Earrings,"I was purchasing 2 carat ROUND earrings and was surprised to receive SQUARE earrings. Lucky for you, I am not a complainer.....I'll settle for these, but was under the impression, based on photos and the absence of the word 'square' in the description that I would receive what I set out to purchase. I went back to look and look again and no where is the word 'square' found.The setting is very nice as are the stones. I was, however, purchasing round stud earrings and did not receive them. I am not willing to pay for return postage, etc. so lucky for you.....I'll let it be"
2,Ormandy non-simpatico,"I must add a word of dissent to the other reviews. Aside from the more abstract Dance Rhapsody 2 which is quite good, Ormandy has little sympathy for the Delius idiom. The slow section of In a Summer Garden is insensitive at this fast tempo, and phrasing is stiff and unyielding in the other works. Ormandy favors thick, pasty sounds, and revels not in the potential for Delius magic. This is certainly not a Delius recording I would recommend. although the VW is decently done."
5,Glue it a major success,Glue It by Mrs. Ulrich was very helpful and I was truly amazed with the results.
3,It's worth it alone to just see the fashion,"In some instances it is difficult to believe the story and to make sense of the plot, however, just for the fashion alone, this is worth seeing. Garbo is her dramatic self, over acting in many instances, but for the day it was appropriate. She exudes her dramatic flair that is so typical and why she is so loved. But the fashion is dynamite."
2,Disappointing,"I'm nuts about Garbo. I've seen 16 Garbo films, including 3 of the Silents. This was by far the least interesting I've yet seen. Typically, Garbo's mere presence makes a movie worthwhile, but this is an exception. It's odd to see Garbo as a blonde in the beginning of the film, but she is her usual alluring self. Unfortunatly, as the movie progresses, the plot stalls and Garbo's character is passive and uninteresting. It's not HER acting that disappoints; It's the dull plot and bored Melvyn Douglas as Garbo's hubby. Even if you love Garbo, this is still a movie you can miss or wait until it shows up on Turner Classic Movies. For an early Garbo talkie unexpected treat, try ""Romance""."
4,The last movie is bad but the others are funny!!,The last movie is bad but the others are funny!! A pretty good value at a good price. your welcome!
3,Brady Bunch Movies,"I couldn't view these on my DVD player - wrong code (this wasn't mentioned on your site). I can watch them on my computer though - I haven't as yet. Love anything ""Brady""!!"
3,smsmollydog,"Neat item, but it did not work with my son's PSP. His was the wrong model so it did not fit. Seller description was spot on, just didn't work for us. Very neat product for another model. quick shipment"
4,people power only works if we all think the same and i know i don't,"Freedom is when we hand back governance to the governments which allows us to be free independant citizens to pursue life. Where is the freedom of a democratic society when we as citizens do the work of government.Governments and public servants you have indulgent lives, earnt it. We elect governments we should elect the public servants as well. Citizens shouldn't create another beauracracy but be allowed to 'police' the existing ones."
5,Thermos 16 ounce backpack bottle,"I love this Thermos, coffee will stay hot in this for 6 hours. I also use ice tea in it and it stays cold for along time. Just make sure you wipe off the inside rim of any ice pieces or the lid won't seal and you can get a drip. We've bought 4 of these, they're just a little expensive but worth it."
5,Excellent Thermos,"I have used this thermos virtually during every day at Pittsburgh. It keeps heat extremely well, it's very comfortable to use, coffee was never spilled, and it's very comfortable to drink from. I regard this thermos to be one of my best investments so far, and highly recommend it to anyone."
5,"Thermos Nissan 16-Ounce Stainless Steel Backpack Bottle, Smoke Color","An excellent purchase. Keeps hot for about 4 hours. I love this and carries it everywhere I go.Thermos Nissan 16-Ounce Stainless-Steel Backpack Bottle, Espresso"
4,Keeps my water warm,I need to drink my water warm and have found this to be a good container for ease of use (one handed) and portability (doesn't leak) and it keeps my water warm all day. Only comment would be the inner seal tends to get a bit off color (moldy?) after a year or so of constant use. But their warranty is really good.
3,"OK, but leaks a little","I bought this originally to bring juice to work in from my juicer. I popped it in the refrigerator the night before to keep it cold. It stayed cold all day then, which is excellent. I love how long this thing keeps liquids cold. I haven't tried hot liquids in it yet. I love that it's normal stainless steel, since anything painted seems to start chipping or peeling after a little while. The pour spout makes it easy to pour into another glass if needed without dribbling and I'm sure will help prevent you from burning your mouth on hot liquids. It does slow the flow of liquids, so it probably won't make the best sports water bottle. My biggest complaint about it is liquids seem to get trapped in the lid area and leak out a little while moving if not kept straight up and down. I would normally put this in my backpack where any juice leaking out would cause a sticky mess. A nice bottle, but not the best."
5,Excellent,"I use this to store my coffee in for my drive home from school. I usually fill it up around one in the afternoon to drink on my way home around seven. Every time I have used this product the coffee is still hot when I drink it in the evening, even after being in the cup for five hours."
5,Good Product,"My husband is a Nissan Fan, so when I came across this item, I knew he would love it. He takes coffee in it every morning."
1,"Latch breaks, manu doesn't stand behind despite warranty","This bottle is absolutely outstanding at keeping water cold but the hinge/tab break VERY easily...I had two different ones each break in 6 months with less than daily use. Despite a 5 year (I think) warranty on the product, the lid is not covered and the manufacturer did nothing. Will not purchase a Thermos product again for this reason... a true test of a company is how they stand behind their products/handle complaints and Thermos failed."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product. It is perfect on the go, you can drink your favorite hot beverage with an ease while you drive, walk... It is light and leak proof. It also keep hot for hours. I like it so much. This should be a great gift for the holiday."
5,magical coffee thermos!,"If you need a coffee tumbler that can travel without leaking and keep coffee hot for hours, look no further. This product more than fits the bill in both departments. I'm incredibly satisfied with this thermos and have been obsessively singing its praises to all my friends. I don't have time to sip my coffee in the morning as I hurriedly bike to class and work every day (usually running late), so I love being able to throw this bottle into my bag and know that a) it won't leak AND b) that it will be piping hot when I get to class/work. Plus I can sip HOT coffee all day as the magical insulation in this thing keeps beverages hot for HOURS and HOURS (the coffee I made at noon today is still warm 8 hours later). I couldn't be happier with this product. Best thermos ever for coffee addicts. :)"
3,It leaks but keeps beverages hot,"If you really need a thermos that doesn't leak, this isn't for you. I unboxed it and filled it half way with water, put the top on tightly, and closed the clasp. Upon shaking it vigorously, a small amount of water dribbled out of the top.If you need a spill-resistant thermos that keeps your coffee warm all day, this might be for you. I like the 16oz capacity and the flip top works so far but I think the small exposed spring will prove to be the weak point in the design.It can be operated with one hand, which is convenient.Since this is a ""Backpack bottle"" I might add that you will want to make sure it's upright in your backpack and not shaken well since it does leak."
4,Pays for itself,"I purchased this item for my daughter after she used one of mine on a recent visit and liked it so much. I have had two of these for 10 years or so and use one every day for my morning coffee, saving between 10 and 25 cents by bringing my own cup, and it keeps the coffee warm and fresh. The top makes a good seal and can be flipped open with one hand, but don't drop it as the plastic latch will break."
5,Best water bottle yet,This bottle is the best one I have ever seen. My GF had a bottlefor about 3 years and it broke after about 25 drops but she loved it. So I did some searching and found this one it keeps her water cold all day and ice stays ice all day without getting wet on the outside of the bottle. She loves it and it is a great bottle.
5,Great,I went off reviews from Amazon and bought this to keep water hot for my son's bottles when we are on the go. When we are home I use it to keep iced water cold when I am working at my desk. Too bad it's not dishwasher safe. I like the spout and have never had any problems with spillage. Highly recommended.
5,This is my third,"I love the Thermos Backpack Bottle because it doesn't leak. Or, well, it doesn't leak so long as I am careful not to overfill it. Do not fill it past the line! When I am careful not to overfill the bottle, it keeps my coffee hot all day, and I can carry it in my bag without worrying about leaks. The pop-up lid lets me drink without having to unscrew the lid or pour, so it's very convenient for commuting. Best. Thermos. Ever."
4,Spill-proof bottle not so spill-proof,"I bought this for my morning coffee because the traveler mug I bought from Target couldn't keep my coffee warm for an hour. In my office, I sit right under a vent and usually my coffee will start to cool almost immediately. If it's in my Target mug - 1 hour, regular coffee mug - 15 minutes, Thermos Nissan - 8 hours. The coffee doesn't necessarily stay piping hot, but it does remain warm enough to enjoy throughout the day.The reasons for taking off one star is because the liquid does not stay as hot as I'd like, but mostly because it leaks! Originally, I had hoped to drink my coffee directly from the Thermos, but occasionally it will leak and occurs more often than not. Being in business attire, I cannot afford to have these occasional leaks threatening to get on my shirt. Therefore, it forces me to have to pour the coffee into my mug and finish it within 15 minutes."
3,Go with the stainless steel version or look elsewhere,"I purchased the lovely espresso colored thermos in 2009. It does keep coffee molten-hot for a long time, and I toss it into a backpack without leakage. However, as seen in the picture I submitted, the espresso color is a plastic like shrinkwrap over the stainless steel model that has not stood up over time. The color is peeling off and it looks terrible.Also, the rubber stopper that keeps this leak proof, stained coffee brown after day two and all the scrubbing in the world had no effect. It really looks gross and between that and the peeling color, I am ashamed to bring my coffee to a staff meeting.If I had to do it again, I would use the stainless version and pour it into a mug, but that defeats the ""sippy"" nature of the design. To be honest, I think I would go with a coffee thermos device that doesn't absorb stains; one with a little trap door over the drink opening."
2,eventually leaks,"I bought this thermos awhile back and loved it so much I bought one for my sister and one for my nephew.However, eventually (after much use) IT DID start leaking... somehow the rubber gasket just wore down. So now if I tip it (to drink out of it) the liquid will drip down (from that area between the black lid and the silver body)!!!! A REAL problem if you're drinking something like coffee that will stain.....Too bad too.. as it really is the only personal-size thermos that truly keeps a liquid hot even 24 hours later."
5,Best Damn One Handed Thermos on the market.,"This is a first, so I'm glad to be reviewing this product which makes it easy. I have tested (and yes, bought-just ask my wife) well over a dozen various insulated containers for use in the car. No I'm not one of those people who walk around constantly drinking (or hydrating). I use it almost exclusively in my car. It's simple, I want the liquid to stay hot, I want to be able to operate it with one hand, and I don't want it to spill or leak. This is the only product that does that and it does it well. I have given it as a gift to at least a half dozen people and since they are relatives there's no more critical an audience. They agree. Enough said."
4,Works great! Don't overfill it!!,"The only downside is that the lid doesn't come apart for you to wash it. Otherwise, it's a fine coffee mug. Don't overfill it though, otherwise it won't seal and you'll end up with scalding hot coffee all over you! Also, have the lid open when you screw it on. This allows the air to be displaced and will also ensure a tight seal.For a few bucks more, I would recommend the Zojirushi travel mug. The lid does come apart for easy washing and the design is a bit better."
3,Plastic bottom cracked,"The Thermos kept my coffee hot all day long and I was very happy for the first week. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the cheap plastic base. The base of the Thermos is made of some cheap plastic material that cracked in the first week. If it wasn't for that plastic base, I would have given it 5 stars.I did not drop it..."
1,Don't waste your money!,I was soooooo disappointed with this purchase!! This thing LEAKED no matter what! I ended up throwing it in the trash at a work meeting because it wasn't even worth carrying back home. Garbage!
1,Easy to get bacterial grown on blue rubber,"I have used this expensive cups for couple of months. It is really good to keep the drink hot or cold.One thing I cannot bear is:The blue rubber is pretty easy to get stain. In fact, the edges part of the rubber will make it a perfect niche for bacterials. That's not good for health.SO BE AWEARE of that !"
2,"Initially loved this thermos, but now not so much","I read the previous reviews before purchasing this thermos for my daughter and most people seemed pleased. Although there was some concern of this thermos leaking, I thought that was unlikely. Initially, my daughter LOVED the thermos, she said that is keeps her drinks hot all day and it was perfect for her; however, I now know I should have listened to the reviews because the thermos has started sporadically leaking. The first time it leaked, she was wearing a white top and the thermos leaked hot chocolate on the front of her. She thought that maybe she didn't tighten the top correctly. Since then, she has used it a few more times (being a bit more careful) and it still leaks randomly, not sure why. I would have given this item 5 stars in the beginning, but since I have to now buy a new thermos just a two months later, I can not give a good rating for durability or cost since it was too expensive to only last two months."
1,Leaky,Nice design but does not consistly stayed sealed and has leaked multiple times in my briefcase and while I was drinking from it.
4,Sturdy and Good Thermal Functions,"I bought this bottle and have been using it for more than a month and it is fantastic. I usually fill it up pre-chilled water and a handful of ice cubes and the ice cubes will still be there after 12 hours. I live in a country with an average temperature of 31 Degrees Celsius and this a really good bottle to keep my drinks cool. However I've noticed that the ice cubes melt faster (5-6 hours or faster) if the bottle is not stored upright eg. lying in my bag, but this is no biggie because the water will still be cold for a period of time. I give this 4 stars because the bottle actually retains the smell of other beverages such as iced teas even after 5 washes. Overall excellent product with no leakages, you won't regret it if you fill it up with only plain water."
2,Loved the cup but didn't hold up,I bought this cup for my husband for a Valentine's Day present. He works construction and is hard on thermos cups. This one lasted 4 months before the lid broke. He likes the cup and wants a replacement lid but I think the same thing will happen again. The hinge on the lid just won't hold up in a lunch box. Good cup if you are very careful with it.
2,LEAKS!!!,"This worked great for about a week. Then it started leaking everywhere! Some days it would leak so much that I couldn't drink from it without making a mess, other days it worked fine. The lid was on SECURELY in both instances. I don't know what the determining factor is. Maybe sometimes the o-ring gets pushed out of pace when tightening. Either way, I decided it was easiest to just return it."
5,Great Product,"We have two of these. My wife uses hers constantly only for hot coffee and tea. After trying many different travel mugs and containers, this is the only one she feels keeps her drinks hot enough. She's dropped hers quite a few times and the plastic bottom is beginning to crack, but it otherwise is fine.I mostly keep ice water in mine, and occasionally hot tea. The tea stays hot for many hours (too hot if it starts out that way), and the cold retention is amazing. I put a few ice cubes in cold water and after 10 house the ice cubes are often still there. I like the compact size and the easy one handed cover release (with an extra safety closure. Cleaning is easy, and the overall design is unusually thoughtful. My only minor complaint is that the narrow base make the thermos easy to tip over, and it too easily slips out of backpack pockets."
5,Better than sliced bread,"A great product that actually meets its specs. I use it everyday. Forget about those travel mugs. They couldn't keep ice cold in a blizzard. But, this bad boy will keep hot or cold drinks - hot or cold - for 6+ hours. And for the price? Super value, baby!"
5,Impressed,"When I first used this, it leaked; then I discovered that I'd unseated the gasket when I cleaned it. With a minor adjustment, no leaks. It also REALLY keeps your drinks HOT. I don't like my beverages too hot, and at first I was dumping my tea and coffee right into the bottle. On a few occasions, it stayed too hot for me to drink even after 6 hours or so sitting in my office. Get the temperature right before you put it in the bottle."
1,Leaks!,"After doing quite a bit of research on Amazon, I finally decided to give this bottle a try. What I wanted was a product that kept my coffee hot all day at work, was easy to drink from and didn't leak. I never worried about a smell or trouble cleaning this one, even though some of the reviews said different. We tried it for a few days and found almost immediately it leaked from under the band where the top screws on.Cleaning wasn't a problem and no noticeable smell.The leaking was awful though. It is being returned."
5,Fantastic performance,This thermos when used as suggested (warm with hot water before filling)keeps coffee (or other hot stuff) hot for several hours and warm overnight. I prefer sipping coffee over the long haul and although not HOT after 10 hours it is not COLD either. I love this thing.
5,Wonderful!,"I really like this product, it truly keeps my water cold for hours! I also love the flip top which is great!"
5,too good!,"I have burned myself several times, hours after filling with hot tea. Be careful, it works VERY well!A really great product. I feel safe knocking it over and it's very easy to use with one hand."
4,Original Nissan Mugs,"I still use my original Nissan Mugs (10+ years now). I bought one of these new ones to see if the poor spout wouldwork better. It does, but is also probably the vulnerable part of the design. Stainless body is thinner as well.It does work well though although I am sure it will not survive a tumble from my motorcycle like the old model."
5,Nearly Perfect,"The great thing about this thermos is that you can drink from it or pour from it with equal ease. I do both regularly. It doesn't leak. There's a latch that prevents accidental opening. It's fairly easy to clean since the mouth doesn't narrow by much. It does a good job of retaining heat or cool, and it looks good and is easy to hold. And unlike those coffee-cup-with-lid things, you really can toss this into a backpack.Edit: After several years of use, the enamel has started to chip off in a couple of spots. It's annoying, but it's still perfectly usable."
1,"Wow, terrible mug!","I bought this mug because I needed something that 1.) would fit in the cup holder of my son's stroller and 2.) not leak while we walk on the very bumpy sidewalks of Philadelphia. I am SO disappointed in this product! Almost every day coffee drips down the side of the mug and then onto my shirt when I take a sip. (And no, I don't fill the mug with too much liquid)."
1,"Leaky, pricey water bottle","Thermos, be ashamed! It's expensive, looks great, and leaks horribly...steadily and persistantly. A real disappointment and waste of money."
5,Fantastic Thermos!,"This thing I'd fantastic! Stays hot for hours.Getting one for the hubby, as now he's jealous. :)I would recommend this product for hot or cold beverage lovers."
5,Best thermos ever,Keeps things hot or cold for hours.It never leaks.It's easy to drink from.It's the easiest to clean that I have ever owned.It's the second one I own and I bought three more incase they stop making it.
5,Excellent Choice,"I find that this thermos keeps my coffee very hot for 6+ hrs. No leaks (but watch out for leaks if you over-fill.) I thought I'd add that the top of this device is spring-loaded. When you press the light grey ""trigger"" tab located on the front of the top, the top springs open and presents you with the sipping spout. This trigger comes with a simple swing-wire ""lock"" that you can snap up and ""lock"" the spring-loaded top so that it doesn't open accidentally. Good design...."
5,Best thermos I've ever bought!,Love it! It's the right size for me and fits in my backpacks. Keeps my coffee hot for hours in a day.
4,Be carful,"I love this thermos but this is the 4th one I,ve purchased. If you knock it over just right u can break the plastic catch. This means u will have to lock the top after every sip. Other than that I just keep buying them."
4,almost perfect,"This is a great mug for keeping your coffee warm, and at the same time, offers a nice lid for drinking out of. I don't like my coffee too hot, and this lid has a lip that allows you to get a controlled sip to test the temp before drinking too much. Plus it's instant open--you don't need to unscrew anything.My only complaint is that the lid is pretty ugly--the white part gets stained and shows the brown coffee trail at high contrast. The baby blue seal is a bit too bright and looks kind of like a bottle, with these nipples sticking out."
2,Leak-proof? I think not!,"I take coffee with me to work every day, so about a year ago I purchased this pretty expensive thermos/travel mug. I looked it over really carefully when I bought it. There was a rubber gasket in addition to a rubber protruding ""nipple"" to keep liquid locked inside. It is in fact Thermos brand (cobranded with Nissan Stainless), which is generally pretty reliable. Of course, there was also the cool brushed metal look of it. But now, it leaks! I could fill it up way below that special ""fill to line"" and it could still be soaking wet by the time I get to work. The worst part about it though is how unpredictable it is. This morning I wouldn't have guessed that it would leak at all, but I make it to work and unpack my lunch and all my little ziploc sandwich bags are swimming. So, for anyone considering purchasing one of these, I recommend you think it over carefully before you do. At the very least, hang on to that lifetime limited warranty sheet. You'll need it! Arrrgh."
4,Pretty good item,"Fast shipping, safe bottle, keep temperature for a very long time. I buy a brown one, it is even beatiful than I thought."
5,Simply amazing,"This thermos has an amazing ability to keep things hot or cold. I fill it up with hot coffee in the morning and go snowshoeing in 20F weather and then drink the coffee on the drive home 7 hours later and it is still almost too hot to drink.This size is the perfect form factor for holding, putting in car cup holders, or stuffing in any part of a backpack. You can even put it in a big pocket of a jacket if you need to.Never spills (just make sure to leave enough room for the top to screw in without overflow).Container is all stainless steal. Top is hard plastic, seal is silicone. I don't generally like plastic or silicone, but my sense is that liquid doesn't sit touching these unless you have it upside down.These thermoses are addictive. People around you will want one, so go ahead and buy several."
5,Best ever,"This is the first thermos I've had that actually does what it's supposed to; keeps stuff HOT!I make my coffee with a plastic cone on top with. #4 filter and it stays hot all day. No leaks, easy to drink from, no complaints."
4,Looks good,"I purchased this bottle for use when travelling. Since acquiring the bottle, I have not had an occasion to use it."
5,all the reviews were right,"...this thermos is awesome. It doesn't spill even if it's not upright. I bring it with me everywhere. Often i just snap on the lock and throw it in my bookbag and I haven't had a spill yet. It's easy to clean because of the stainless steel. And it insulates very well (yes, sometimes too well). I'm very happy with this purchase; definitely spend a little more on your thermos if you're going to use it often. This one is a worthwhile investment, rather than getting many cheaper ones that spill, leak, break, etc. I often boast about my thermos =)"
3,Good thermos,This is a good thermos and keeps your drink really cold or hot. I would recommend you clean it thoroughly after each use otherwise it will get the typical thermos odor. Will buy again.
1,Leaks like a sieve,"Worked great for about a month and a half, but then began leaking profusely.The thing is amazing at how long it will keep liquids warm, but that is all for nothing when it keeps spilling out all over you.Buyer beware. If you buy this you take the chance that your drink will end up all over you without warning."
1,It LEAKS!! and it LEAKS all the time!!,This thermos LEAK on first use right out of the box!! It leak from the cap no matter how tightly I screw it in. I use it to hold hot water and it leek all the time.It does keep liquid hot for a 6 to 8 hours. So what? big deal! I know some asian made thermos that kept the liquid steaming hot for 48 hours!! This thermos does not impress me.
2,Color is totally different from the photo!,I'd ordered silver one as shown in the photo of product description. However i got just stainless one without any silver coating over it.Very disappointed!
5,Best Travel Mug!,"This is it. If you commute and love your coffee hot, buy this bottle. Pick any color...this will keep your coffee hot for hours."
2,This product rusts!,I thought I had the perfect thermos. It's compact and I could drink directly out of it. I didn't even have this product for a year when I look inside while washing it and noticed that it had started rusting at the bottom. I never took a good look inside when I washed it before so who knows how long the rust was there. Thermos advertises this as stainless steel so I don't understand why it would rust. I did send it back to Amazon and received a full refund. I wish I could give this product 5 stars but I can't.
2,Good at keeping temp but leaks.,After using this thermos for a few time. It still keeps my water warm for a long time but the problem is that it leaks.I love warm water so leaking water is not a big problem but it's annoying when the water drips on dance floor and gym. I bought a same one for the fiance but he is a coffee drinker so the leaking causes him more trouble. Likes it can keep liquid warm but the leaking is frustrating. Won't buy it again.
5,Greatest Beverage Carrier -- No Leaks!!!,"I have 4 of these in my family -- they're great! As long as you don't overfill (the company's website tells you where to fill to), you can toss this thermos, you can do whatever with it -- and it won't leak. And it keeps everything amazingly hot for hours and hours! Especially for long road trips, this is something you don't wanna be without!"
5,Best sippy thermos ever.,"There are products that deserve design awards, and this is one of them. Even fits on the bicycle holder cage thingy. Shipped right out and packaged well."
5,I highly recommend it!,"I bought one a couple years ago really loved it so we bought a second one. Now our adult son has requested one as a gift. It is the best thermos we have ever owned. It keeps hot beverages hot for hours longer than any other insulated container we've owned and it's easy to open, drink from and clean."
3,Love hate relationship,I really like everything about this thermos but it's durability. I have purchased 2 and really want to get a third but commons sense has stopped me. On one the top broke off and the second I cannot recall what broke. However it keeps hot beverages hot for long periods
3,Item leaks,"The item is not really spill proof as the description says. Item is very inconsistent. Some days it leaks, some days it doesn't. I cannot seem to figure out what I am doing to make it leak. I am convinced it is the thermos as I had another spill proof thermos why I actually dropped and it never leaked even after I dropped it. Unfortunately the clasp broke on that one which is why I had to replace it."
4,Great Product,"This keeps beverages hot for a long time (hrs). Our only complaint is that the flip open top tends to break. This usually doesn't happen for many months. We cannot find any replacement screw on tops and need to purchase a new thermos. Despit the breakage, we love this product and have purchased several as gifts."
4,Cool bottle!,"Have used it for a while, simply love it. Just not sure how long can the press-button pop-up cover last.... it is convenient to use, as for durability, it is still a question mark...."
5,Doesn't spill,Doesnt' spill and keeps it hot. I have taken this to work with me and coffee stays drinkably warm well into the late afternoon!
5,Best Purchase of the Year,"I am an extremely frugal/broke college student with a taste for warm beverages. This is without a doubt my favorite purchase of the year. After twenty years on this planet I am finally realizing that it pays off in the end to spend a little extra for a quality product and this is a quality product. it keeps drinks hot for HOURS. I got a chai latte an hour before departing for my five hour car ride home for Thanksgiving. I got to enjoy HOT chai the entire ride home. Absolutely fabulous.You're also doing the environment some good by using this mug. All my other mugs didn't work well and I often would forget them when going to buy specialty drinks but now I always make sure I have this mug with me when I go, so I can enjoy my drinks for hours.I am also thrilled to read about amazing experiences people have had on here with customer service. You don't get that everywhere these days.Bravo! I can't wait to buy a few more for Christmas gifts."
2,Leaks,"I was so excited when I first found this ""leak-proof"" thermos - what a great idea. Unfortunately after occasional use for about one year it now leaks... The name would seem to imply leaking is the one thing it should not do. When I do try to use it, I end up with coffee all over my car, clothes, desk, etc.. Shucks."
5,Perfect,"I use this occasionally to keep milk cool while I work at school. I leave in the morning, and my milk will still be fresh when I arrive home. (Note that if you do use it for milk, you'll want to clean it thoroughly or it'll smell, of course). I like it so much that I decided to get a couple for my parents. It keeps coffee hot so well that it surprised my mother (she may have burnt herself a bit on the first sip). Definitely a great product if you want to keep your drink hot or cold all day long."
4,Bike coffee carier,This backpack bottle fits very nicely in the water bottle holder on the bike frame and dispenses small sips at a time so it is ideal for bike commuting. Be careful because the coffee stays hot for quite some time.
5,Great product.,"This is a great product. It is really a non-leak product that I ever used unless you fill it up too full, it also keeps warm for a long time. I am very happy to have it. Highly recommended."
5,Best Personal Thermos Bottle,This bottle works extremely well. It keeps coffee hot for hours and it's leakproof. You won't be disappointed. I've had several personal thermos containers and not one has done as well as this one. I plan to buy another one if the other colors become available.
1,No luck for me!,"I purchased this thermos in hopes of being able to take my tea to class everyday, but I just couldn't get it to stop leaking from where the lid screws on. Determined, I returned it and got a replacement. Same problem. Guess it just wasn't meant to be. The heat holding capability of the actual thermos is amazing though, almost to the point of too good!"
4,"It keeps beverages hot, hot, hot.","This is a great thermos. I specifically purchased it for drinking coffee in my car. I wanted to make sure beverages would not spill on my cars leather interior, and I was not disappointed. The thermos really does keep beverages hot for 8 hours."
1,Not for serious practitioners,I am a student of Filipino Martial Arts (Escrima) and one of the two padded foam batons broke during the first day of training. This product is not that durable in my opinion and I would not recommend it for any serious practitioners of stick fighting combat.
3,Good for LIGHT practice,"Like others have said, these are good for light practice. They have a decent weight and feel. The caps do tend to come off, and the foam does move around a lot. The foam also breaks and cracks. I used these for about 2 weeks and had one break in 3 during sparing. Going full speed they do pack a punch. The beauty is that you can spar with no gear on, just watch the fingers."
3,Good For Light Home Practice,"I bought two of these to use at home for striking practice on my heavybag, and they're great for that. The end caps come off easily, so I just left them off. And the foam covering tends to move around from use, but easily move back into place. They take a lot of abuse and the core is firm enough to let me strike a hard as I like, without tearing up my heavybag."
5,Great,"This is a great product for any child to enjoy and even a few adults. It's good, clean, and tasteful."
4,icarly season 1 vol 2,"The DVD I ordered came very quickly. It came shipped in a package suitable for the item. The DVD case itself was a little damaged and one of the parts that keeps the DVDs in place in the case were also damaged a little causing one of the DVDs to slide around inside. The DVDs itself seemed fine and I don't have a problem playing them, which is why I didn't contact the seller. Overall I would recommend this seller, and woulld buy from them again."
5,I love this show,This show is one of the best and I Love watching it. I would recommend that everyone watches it. You won't regret it.
2,Very inaccurate.,"A nice effort from the author but the subject is huge and needed more dedication to reach a successful book which this one is not. I could spot about fourteen different mistakes on the first half an hour of reading this book,For example, in page 51 he says that Thomas Boss joined James Purdey, while we know from Donald Dallas's book -which preceded this book by several years- that Boss never joined Purdey but was rather a worker for the trade and did work by commision for all the gunmskers including Purdey.And so like mistakes on Frederick Beesley, Holland, Woodward, Manton and Scott sections. Still a good effort though."
4,works great until it ages,"this is one of the office staples that everyone has in the drawer...it works well, however it has two faults:-it ages poorly. When this gets old, it clumps and will not go on smoothly.-it takes some time to dry.Consider the correction tape if either of these issues are of concern.Otherwise, this does the job."
4,Works Fine.,"I needed a lot of correction fluid for a poetry project and tried different types. This one has a wedge-shaped little sponge instead of bristles, and this makes it easy to cover one line very precisely. Unlike the brush-type White Out, this does not clump easily. That said, it still does dry out after a while. If that happens, nail polish remover will dissolve the clumps so you can use it again. You'll only need two or three drops or you'll end up with too thin a liquid to cover up anything.Like the other types of correction fluid I've used, this has a fairly potent smell, so if you'll be working with this a lot, keep that in mind. I don't know if there are products out there that release fewer chemical fumes. Also, on the long run, be careful not to bend the sponge too much back and forth, as it may come loose eventually."
3,"A good effort, but falls short","This is a good CD for kids, with decent narration of Peter and the Wolf, but lacking elsewhere. There is no narration for the Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra nor to the Carnival of the Animals. For my toddler, this relegates this CD to the back of the pile. However, the performances are good. Its low price and its presentation of three classic pieces make this an attractive issue, but in none of the three cases can this be said to be the best offering available. Look for Bernstein's classic rendition of the Britten and the more recent Patrick Stewart narration of the Prokofiev."
4,little pricey. works great though,"perfect for lighting up the cab, good for seeing ashtray or if your tryin to twist a L. 4 stars cause expensive, i swear they used to be 6 bucks at walmart. on off switch nice too can leave plugged in. easily bend it wherever you need to see."
5,From the inside cover-,"This book offers a wide variety of embroidery designs in both crewel and needlepoint techniques, which can be used as ll-over patterns, borders, and decorative spots on such things as lampshades, cushions, curtains, table linens, shirts, smocks, skirts, aprons, bags and so on. These designs have been adapted from aztec, mayan and Inca pottery, baskets, and textiles. some are abstract, others show strange birds, animals, serpents, and fish. They are exotic, exciting and even grotesque and should be worked in bold colors. anyone looking for motifs in a different idiom will find a wealth of ideas in this book!"
2,mediocre,"The author has chosen to utilize her own lifestyle to display a ""chic"" approach to the whole question of non-monogamous living, although the underpinning of her thesis is that, despite the moral majority support, she denies this. It lacks focus, direction and, at times, plays considerably on the general lack of knowledge which the vast majority of individuals have on this subject. Recommend that readers choose an alternate if available."
3,Question self-contradictory aphorisms,"Although I agree in spirit, I can't help finding it ironic. An order, via bumper dictum, to challenge orders. I'm too cautious, but I always have the temptation to approach these cars and ask: ""question authority? Says who?"""
4,Solid Mendelssohn,"I picked up a bunch of these Vanguard Classics titles years ago in a Borders sale bin, and have never regretted my buying decision. They are all solid late mono and early stereo recordings of the standard repertoire, sometimes by famous conductors like Adrian Boult and Pierre Monteux, but more often by lesser-known maestros like Vladimir Golschmann and Felix Prohaska. Here we have the latter two leading the Vienna State Opera Orchestra in some of Mendelssohn's most magnificent works -- the ""Italian"" and ""Reformation"" Symphonies (4 & 5), excerpts from ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and a really strong Violin Concerto with Mischa Elman. If you find this two-fer as inexpensively as I did, it would make a great reference recording for the connoisseur collector."
1,disappointment,"I liked Amazon.com's service, its the product that I didn't like. I thought I was ordering Celestial Body Lotion by Thierry Mugler instead it was a parfumed type body lotion. The picture on my right is of the parfumed type NOT what I wanted at all but decided to keep it as I do not like the hassle of returning and trying to get credit back on my acct or card."
5,I love Angel,"I have the original container that my Angel powder came it, and this was a refill that was half the price I would have given for a new container. I love this fragrance, and I try to get a deal on it any time I can. It is my signature fragrance."
3,Refill What?,I like the product but need to know if there is some kind of dispenser to order that it can be put into.
1,i,"In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener & some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries. Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma..."
4,Still sounds as good as ever!,"I used to own this on LP. One of the best vocal albums I'd ever owned.Did justice to Marvin Gaye's ""Baby I'm For Real"". Man! What a voice!! Really amazed with what Gerald Albright did on the sax in that song.What more could one ask for?!"
3,pretty good set,"Sherrick had a distinctive voice in the Teddy Pendergrass rawness and smoothness. my cut off this album was ""Just Call"". that was one of my jams back in 1987. Bro Man had good solid range and tone. the rest of the album is cool and still sounds cool. Sherrick was a cat who should have been bigger considering his vocal range alone."
2,poorly organized,"The book is poorly organized. Information is incompleted.You would have a lot of question marks in your headafter reading the book.I was misled by those positive comments from amazon.The ""Pragmatic"" book is much much better."
4,Haunting stories about real people,"In My Other Life gets at the truth of people's lives. The stories are trying to do something new and wonderful. They don't have the cliches associated with so much fiction, instead they resemble the way we all come to understand how our lives have become what they are. No great dramatic events...just quiet realizations about what we really are. Silber is really truthful in her writing, and reveals how characters are thinking and feeling so that they seem really alive. A reader can learn a lot about living from this book."
5,Catch this,I have to admit that this album is my favorite among all the Noir Desir's. It starts by a great song and ends up by a better one. A little end note:if you like ND try also Diabologum.
4,Compelling story,"I had a hard time putting this down, I really wanted to find out what happened to the kids. The writing was spare yet very descriptive, the dialog real, and the scenery easy to visualize. Enjoyed it very much!"
3,It wasn't what I expected,This vocal and mix just didn't do it for me. I heard about this in reviews and was not impressed with the credibility of the reviews.
4,Excellent biography...,"This biography of Patrick Cleburne proves to be very readable and insightful. The book appears to be well researched and its obviously that the author favored his subject.Cleburne appears to be a very controversial even while he was alive. Perhaps because of his foreign birth, he was more sympathic about the conditions of the blacks and made proposals that didn't go well with his fellow southerners. The book revealed that he was a superb leader and intelligent commander. His superiors definitely didn't aid their cause by keeping him just as a divison commander when he could have been an excellent corps commander - in an army where corps commanders were not well regraded.The author painted a vivid and complete picture of this general whose reputation have grown considerably since the Civil War among all Civil War readers."
5,Stonewalll of the West,For anyone intrested in the war in the west and in Patrick Cleburne in perticular it is a must read book. It is well worth the price. No matter your feeking it provides a vivid picture of the Man and his surroundings. Nothing is glossed over or left out.
5,"Very, very good","""Stonewall of the West"" by Craig L. Symonds is a biography of the well-known, very accomplished and much admired Confederate general, Patrick Cleburne.The book is a comfortable read but not at all simplistic or wretchedly moral. It gives a poignant picture of a young immigrant and his personal ""American journey"". That alone is a refreshing change from bios about West Pointers descendant from the Mayflower in the Civil War.In doing so it exposes the reader to much of the human side of the Civil War and the events experienced by Cleburne. Perhaps best of all it is pretty much a clear-eyed look at the likeable and very human Cleburne. Author Symonds adds a respectful, fair-minded epilogue that summarizes Cleburne's personality and New World sojourn quite well. Finally, it is nice to read of a Civil War luminary who was actually modest, amiable, sincere and principled."
3,Stonewall of the West,"This is the first book that I've read on Cleburne. Much of it I enjoyed, the part on his proposal to enlist slaves into the Confederate Army in particular, but found that detail was lacking in too many other areas. Also, if one did not have prior knowledge of the Army of Tennessee, they would be very lost."
2,Boring...,"Don't waste your money on this Pixter game. My kids are fans of Sponge Bob, but this game loses interest quick. It is not challenging. The music is original from the show-that's about the only fun part of it."
2,It is a SPONGE alright!,"My daughters, who are new converts to the cult of Bob, lost interest in this assessory to the excellent PIXTER system. Most of the assessories, and the system itself offers multiple play options and a variety of play, just NOT THIS ONE. S-Bob, allows you to play bits in real-time video from a number of TV episodes and it allows for the shuffling/editing of random scenes, but not much else. I'd suggest getting one of the other PIXTER assessories instead."
4,They seem to like it,I haven't had much time to play it but the seem to enjoy it.. it's Spongebob after all (came with the Pixter)
3,Not quite as advertised,"I have only been using these for a short time, but these seem to be good quality cooking chopsticks. They are a bit thicker than other chopsticks (cooking or eating) which makes them easier to handle for cooking. My only complaint is that these are advertised as 18"" long, and the ones I received are 15-1/2"". The main reason I chose this product was because I wanted chopsticks as long as possible to reach safely into my deep cooking pot. These are still usable, but I need to be careful since the missing 2-1/2"" gives me less clearance over hot water than I was hoping for."
1,FABRIC is missing from this FLAG.,"To judge a book of quotes on a general subject one must look at the job the editors did. What did they put in? What did they leave out? Simple research in the index reveals the slant. e.g. Quotes from presidents and vice presidents since 1960: Reagan, Nixon, Bush, Ford, Agnew, Quayle with 36 year of service in national office were quoted a sum total of twice. Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Clinton, Gore, Humphrey and Mondale with a total of 28 years of national service were quoted 72 times. Hillary Clinton alone was quoted twice. The editors can't even find quotes from Reagan on ""American Values and Virtues?"" I would not be so critical if the Title was changed to: ""Some American Values and Virtues"" or ""American Values and Virtues we Approve"""
1,Not Worth the Paper It's Printed On,Too bad there is no zero rating. The editors have killed too many trees to create this work which runs in the face of comprehension and educates on nothing.
4,by far the best history of a clan,I wish the Gangrel clanbook was as inspiring as this oppus. This clanbook provides a coherent history explaing why the nosferatu are cursed as they are as well as many tips on playing a sewer rat. In my opinion the best clanbook of them all.
1,Where does the dirt go?,"Just another 'tumble and save' product. I wonder, where does the dirt go? Does it go up the dryer vent?I wouldn't tumble my underwear and bedsheets in the dryer with a scented sheet and call them cleaned, why would I do the same with my favorite suit or blouse? Dirt and soil left on clothes does more damage by breaking fibers and causing wear. I'd rather stick with a real dry cleaner that does real dry cleaning than try to save a few dollars and wreck my clothes (then have to pay even bigger bucks to replace them)."
5,my wife swears by these things,"My wife loves these things, so I keep buying them. We use them to clean sweaters in the laundry. So far so good."
5,Couldn't live without it,This really works. It is so easy to use and does a great job.Saves me lots of time and money.
1,Pilled up sweater upon first use,Really bummed this morning after my first use of this Woolite product. Upon removing a sweater from the dryer I noticed an excessive amount of pilling on the front -- this wasn't originally there. Can still wear the sweater but now it will won't be going on any business trips with me and will be relegated to a casual piece. Better off handwashing or paying my local cleaners.
1,LEFT HUGE DARK STAINS,"I have been a Dryel user for a long time but tried this product the other day on a dark green cotton sweater and a pair of dark green cotton sweatpants. Both came out with HUGE ROUND DARK STAINS on them. I followed directions to a tee. Both these garments have been cleaned by Dryel many times without a problem. This time, using a Woolite sheet, they went into the dryer without stains and came out with stains. The hotline is closed over the weekend but I'm putting a call into the Woolite folks first thing Monday AM.Hw could the chemical in these sheets cause stains like this??Will never use again. And am upset that the sweater is now unwearable and cost me a pretty penny."
2,Doesn't clean dirty clothes,"When clothes aren't dirty, they don't need and should not be cleaned - whether at home using Dry Cleaners Secret or at the Professional dry cleaner. I clean my clothes when they are dirty - which means they may have a spot of dirt or something else on them.Dry Cleaner's Secret simply does not work on 90% of the spots on my clothes. Just does not get the spot out - even though I have carefully followed instructions and even when i've tried two applications.Dry Cleaners Secret gets two stars because, well, it does ""freshen"" clothes, but they sure aren't clean - and they still need to have the wrinkles removed by using the steamer."
1,Doesn't remove odors,"I purchased this product after reading many positive reviews, but it did not live up to my expectations. I hoped that by using the sheets I would not have to take my dress shirts to the dry cleaners as often, and could perhaps ""freshen"" them up after wearing so that I could wear a shirt 2 or 3 times before taking it to the cleaners.My primary hope for the product was that it would remove or at least mask under arm odor, but the sheet had little to no affect in removing the smell.The sheet did give the shirts an overall ""fresh"" scent, but the rest of the shirt did not smell to begin with and I don't know that the sheet removed much if any of the odor to the point where the shirt can be worn again without cleaning.I honestly think had I hung the shirt up on a hanger and let it sit for 4 or 5 days I would achieve the same effect.Perhaps my expectations were too high but these does not remove odors as the manufacturer claims it does."
2,Caused shinkage in our drapes,"This product really works for cleaning and leaving a clean, pleasant odor. It did cause shrinkage of our drapes (noticeable) which was not mentioned as a possible result of using the product. The drapes' instructions stated ""dry clean"" only, so I didn't think this would be a problem. Obviously, we could not use the product to clean our drapes as intended."
2,So so... just use a regular sheet with a damp towel,This works about as well as a damp towel and a regular dryer sheet.I don't plan on buying these again.
1,Same as the other reviewer - Left with stains after use,"I got the same problem as the other reviewer. I put this product along with my brand new dress into the dryer. Turned the dress inside out just in case, and the polyester lining came out with stains after 20 minutes, the cotton shell is fine though.My suggestion is if you really want to use this product, beware of putting it along with polyester clothing.P.S. After even prolonged heating in the dryer, the stains still wouldn't go away. So I called Woolite and they promptly reimbursed me for the dry cleaning cost plus postage! This is GREAT customer service!"
1,Not as good as Dryel,I bought the large box of Dry Cleaner's Secret and was very disapointed with its ability to remove perspiration odor. Dryel does a very thorough job unlike Dry Cleaner's Secret. So it's back to purchasing Dryel. (Anyone want a large box of Dry Cleaner's Secret?)
3,Dryer Sheets,"The product is OK, but to me it's just too much work. I'll continue taking my clothes to the dry cleaners."
3,OK but NOT Really Dry Clean Quality,This product is OK but it does not truly clean. There's a lot of perfume in the product to mask any dirty smell in the clothing but it does not clean well. If you need a dress shirt and a pair of slacks fluffed up a bit with a clean scent then Woolite's Dry Cleaner's Secret does the trick. If you're hoping that you can use this and stop taking your clothes to the dry cleaners then you're simply kidding yourself.
5,Excellent product,Doesn't remove big or old stains but helps a little with small stains to make them lighter and works great to make garments and pillows smell and feel fresh. I will definitely buy these regularly. Dab the actual sheet onto the garment stain and in the dryer on medium for 30 minutes and I'm a happy customer :)
3,OK,"I don't think this cleans your shirts, nor make them ""straight"".It refreshes them and I still have to iron shirts.It is nice if for instance you wore a dress or shirt for an hour or 2 and don't want to try clean it.I don't think it's such a great product otherwise."
4,Inexpensive alternative to dry cleaning,"I enjoy using these for ""dry cleaning"" sweaters and other delicate items. They do a nice job providing a fresh, but not overpowering scent. I usually can do 3-4 items at a time and get good results. For only 20 minutes or so in the dryer, these are quick and easy to use. No garment bag needed...just throw everything in the dryer and you are good to go. Stains must be removed before dry cleaning of course. Definitely a good value and way to save some money, especially if you dry clean many clothes."
2,no discernible effect,"sure it ""freshens"" up clothing but how is that any different from adding a bounce sheet?? doesn't do anything for stains (i did read the other reviews) not even light staining. i've tried it twice so far without any real effect besides the ""freshening"". i still have to take my clothes to a proper dry cleaner. :("
1,Ruined two dresses,I've used Dryell for years and thought I'd give this a try. The brand is known for being gentile and the price was better than Dryell. Big mistake. Dresses that I've successfully Dryelled several times were stained with an oil from the Woolite cleaner. I will never buy this product again.
2,Use only for dark clothes that aren't natural fibers.,"I've used dryel at home dry cleaning for years without a problem. I am traveling for work for a month and therefore didn't know the area, but needed to do some at home dry cleaning (paying for it is super expensive.) I couldn't find any dryel so I decided to try the competitor. On my black pants that were not cotton the product worked pretty well. But on my lighter clothing, my sweaters, my nice tops, my dresses, the product left oily stains. It's AWFUL. Basically my entire work wardrobe needed to be hand washed and hung up and then ironed (something I was trying to avoid.) My lighter pants have been washed 3 times and I still can't get the stain out. DON'T use this product if you you've used dryel and liked it; it's not a substitute. You're better off spending the money on dry cleaning than spending money on a new clothing. Woolite should refund me the cost of my clothes. Ridiculous."
4,Met my expectations,"I'm happy I had the option to buy this product using Subscribe and Save. If I clean 4 garmets at a time, as it says I can, it's costing me around $0.30 a piece. The quality of the cleaning is adequate for my needs - I have light wool/synthetic suits I had custom-made abroad and wear suits 5 days a week. The process is quick and easy - just pop it in the dryer, spot clean with the included cloth if necessary. The only downsides are: 1) I worry about getting the cleaning material on my hands - definitely wash them right away and 2) unlike the dry cleaner, this kit won't pleat your pants! I've already cleaned 8 garments with good, fresh smelling and ""stiff but still soft"" feeling results. I'll keep this on my Subscribe and Save and may even need to bump up my next shipment! Thanks, Amazon."
4,Works like a charm,"I have used several products like this and like Dry Cleaners Secret the best. Clothes come out fresher, fluffier and they seem to magically return to the shape they were when you first bought them. An important trick though is to catch them right away when they are done and hang them up immediately. If you do that, you'll love the results and the ease and convenience of doing dry cleanable clothes at home."
4,Woolite Dry Cleaner's Secret refreshes sweaters/dresses,"This product refreshed sweaters and dry-clean-only dresses that needed deodorizing and a bit of a color boost. There is no cleaning fluid, but I used some from another dry cleaning brand to clean soiled sleeves, and it did not work. I think you need to hand wash any ground in soiling before dry cleaning, but if you buy it with that understanding you will be very satisfied with the product."
4,Can't live without it!,"Dry Cleaner's Secret freshens and does a surprisingly good job of spot removal from many garments. While it's not professional dry cleaning, it works well for many items that are better off not washed in water. I save a load on dry cleaning thanks to this product."
4,Save money,"You can always toss one or two extra articles of clothing in, so you save extra money for things that don't NEED to go to the cleaners."
3,not a substitute for dry cleaning,"it isn't super effective. it freshened up the garments a little bit but definitely not a substitute for dry cleaning. i might use it in between dry cleaning to freshen up a dress, but that's about it."
4,Not for spots,"If you can iron, you may not see the dry cleaner's again. Worthless for spots, great for general maintenance."
4,wow .. it really does work !!,"I used these sheets to clean a sportjacket and it worked great. The process is simple and easy too. You just unfold a sheet from the packet and place it in the dryer with the clothing article(s) and dry on medium heat for exactly 20 minutes. Once you take it out of the dryer, then you simply hang it on a clothes hanger and you're finished. I put the product to the test when I cleaned a satin wedding gown that had been packed away in a box for years. The cleaning sheets never helped in removing the pre-existing wrinkles, but the dress came out just fine, and even the delicate lace was unharmed. The gown smelled fresh and was visibly clean .. and I saved about 100 bucks by not taking it to the dry cleaners. I have no negatives about this product whatsoever. I really does work !!"
2,"Very overpriced, ineffective at removing stains, Dryel is better","I purchased this product based on the many positive reviews here, and I was very disappointed.I followed the directions for the product and used one cloth for one two-piece suit. The suit had no stains, but it did have a light odor under the arms, which this ""cleaning"" cloth did not remove or even mask. The only thing this cloth did was give the whole suit a very light fragrance. I don't see how this would remove any staining at all.If you are looking for something to re-fresh your clothing, I would recommend tossing your clothing in the dryer for 15 min with a microfiber (lint-free) damp cloth with a couple of sprays of your favorite perfume. The effect will be the same, and you will save money and save the environment another piece of trash.I have tried Dryel in the past for home dry-cleaning and I am going to go back to it. Dryel makes a much more effective product that actually CLEANS!I would not recommend this product!"
5,Best Dry Cleaning Deal,This product is far better than the other product with the bag found in most stores.I feel my clothes are much cleaner than the last time I took them to the dry cleaners and spent a fortune.
2,XMnot2GO,"We have had our unit for less than one year. I sent it back once already for repairs. The My XM listings would not correspond to the song playing and the unit would just freeze at random. Pioneer sent me a new one and now that one is going back as well for the same problems.I am also very disappointed in the ""built in"" antenna. I have been outside in an unobstructed area with the radio pointed in all directions and the reception is very bad. That said, I have also been in 10 story buildings where it picked up all channels with some care to face it in a southernly direction without the external antenna.All in all, I would not purchase this model again if I new the problems it would give me in the portable mode."
4,Although a little bulky a solid player through and through,"This player delivers on most fronts. The ability to records XM songs live and replay them later as truly portable is why I purchased the system in the first place. One disadvantage of the player is the all or none of recording. System does not allow selective deletion of individual recorded songs as the 5 hours capacity fills up. To make room for more songs, all previous songs must be deleted."
5,Very Very Nice Indeed,"XM and Sirius satellite services have replaced FM for me. i love it and haven't look back since.i have had this receiver since they came out and all in all i have been very satisfied with it.unless you are outside with a clear view of the sky, it really benefits from having the small external antenna most of the time.both the home and car kits work fine.all in all, no complaints. good combination desktop, car and portable receiver."
4,Perfect price and perfect item,"I've had this for a year now. I'm quite satisfied. However, I STILL get confused when I change my channels. I always want to use the volume button on the face to change channels! Regardless, for the price, it's a great deal. Definitely check out the Altec Lansing XM3020 speakers to match this with. Great price they have now for $13.99. Anyhow, XM Airwave is a great little product. Happy with my selection for my first time with XM radio!"
3,Good Product - bad ear phone connections,I've had two Pioneer xm2go receivers over the last 1.5 years. I returned the first one to the dealer that I bought it from because I had trouble getting a consistent sound from the receiver. I have the same problem with my second unit (must be a manufacturing device). The internal antenna is very strong. I'm thankful for that because I cannot pick any stations up using the docking station and the antenna. Good functionality in the product but it has some design and performance issues that are frustrating to deal with.
1,works good for two years then breaks,I have had the airware radio for two years now and I was happy with it until last month when the FM transmitted suddenly stopped transmitting. I contacted Pioneer and they gave me the run around offering the new Inno for $140.00 and my old radio. Can you say RIP OFF. My advice is to avoid this product and all other Pioneer products because they don't back there products up. I thought Pioneer was a trusted brand name. I WAS WRONG!!!
3,A LITTLE OUTDATED,I was disappointed to know that it requires an external antenna all the time...the portability works only for recorded material..not live !! what a turnoff !!
1,look elsewhere,it may have all the features you think you need and at a reasonable price. very unreliable. sometimes for no apparent reason you can't hear people but they can hear you. i bought a $5 used one at a yard sale that lasted longer than this. don't waste your money.
1,Lousy copy cat,"A book like this should tell tales and name names.It does, in some way. But it name more victims' names than the predators' names. And I found that disturbing. There are too many chapters that are copied from Michael Gross's ""Beautiful women and ugly business"". Mr. Gross's book is a good read. ""Shut up and smile"" is not. It is a waste of time, many references other than the copy from Gross's book are public informations.It is said that you can't judge a book by its appearance. But for this book, you can. Most pictures of the cover as well as inside the book are not of right proportion. And if an author and publisher are serious about a book, they will take good care of the looks. It may not be glamorous book cover but you can at least get the picture right! Also, the author is supposed to be under-cover. Why bother showing his pictures in the books? ( twice)This is not a book worth your time. Read ""Beautiful women and ugly business"". ""Shut up and smile"" should have shut up."
1,Waste of time,"To get into the inside life of being a supermodel, you might as well go talk to someone coming out of one of those instant photo boths at the mall."
5,Exciting read,I thought that this book was very entertaining. I really liked the way the author posed as a model. The only thing I would have liked more of was a bit added focus on the underground scene in Europe.
4,Interesting Investigation,"I read through this book with great surprise. I couldn't believe what really goes on in the fashion industry. Let me tell you, this book was a pleasant read, providing excellent anecdotes about the sleaze in fashion. I highly recommend it."
4,one of the better cordless phones,"I've had several of these over many years. With a good battery, it holds a charge for quite a long time - and I sometimes spend much of the day on the phone. Range is pretty good. My office is in the basement in the back of the house, and it works through the house (main and 2nd floors), as well as the garage. Even with slight static in the front driveway, which would be 50+ feet and through some concrete. The base with keypad and speakerphone means if I leave the phone upstairs, I can still make and receive calls - a real help!Uniden did a good job with these."
1,NOT THE CORRECT MODEL!,I ordered the TRU9460-2 and Amazon sent me the TRU9465 (which is what the picture is of on this Web page). I spoke to customer service and they had me send back the original item and they said they would send me out the correct item. I just received the package and *again* they sent me the TRU9465. The phone itself may be great but Amazon is *not* fulfilling these orders properly. They are advertising one model and shipping another. And their customer service is clueless! Somebody at Amazon needs to wake up!
4,Excellent Intro For Adults,"If you love raptors, then this book is a great way to get you started learning about them. The drawings and full color paintings are superb. The information is more than enough for a good introduction, and if you like bird carving, then this is one of the best reference books you can have. I got one for myself, and gave the kids their own. It's not just a coloring book, the activities are designed to get the reader thinking and doing, especially observing nature and not television. Perfect for home schoolers."
3,"Middle-of-the-road, lacking drama","Abbado can give very good and even great Beethoven performances live. This isn't one. Despite the excellent vocal quartet for the last movement, there is no sense of occasion here, just a good reading without risks or depth of feeling. I kept listening for mystery and dramatic intensity in the first movement but couldn't find it. The scherzo went well enough, but the slow movement never rose to express the composer's noble intentions. The choral finale was accomplished from orchestra, chorus, and soloists, but it struck no deep chords. The recorded sound was nothing special the first time around, so I bought this DSD ""enhanced"" remastering, but it still falls shosrt in dramatic impact, clarity and detail.All told, Abbado's later performance on DG as part of his complete cycle is more exciting and personal."
4,Straight forward reading with average sound,"Although the 1999 Penguin guide likes this performance, I cannot agree entirely. It has its great moments and overall the playing and singing are very good. Ben Heppner stands out well among the soloists. But the interpretation doesn't really bring any new insights, and in a market of dozens of Ninths it is merely average. I was also somewhat disappointed with the sound which seemed a bit recessed and definitely not up to the standards I have come to expect from Berlin. I had trouble hearing some of the detail. If you are searching for a Ninth you may want to check out Charles Mackerras/Royal Liverpool Philharmonic on EMI, Gunter Wand on RCA, either of Bernstein's readings on DG, or Sinopoli's recent Dresden recording on DG."
2,some serious inaccuracies,"I generally like the DK series, so I thought this one would be good. But there were some serious inaccuracies here. The one that bothered me most was the photo of a kitten tangled in string, titled ""if you provide your cats with enough stimulation . . ."" Many cat books warn against letting cats play with string or thead as it can cause serious damage passing through the intestines if swallowed. After having to cut a cat free from a big tangle of string, I am careful not to leave it around anymore. In general the book had some good information, but not much of it. I'm finding Think Like a Cat by Pam Johnson-Bennett much more useful. It isn't full of cute pictures, just good information."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I see that other reviewers loved this book, but I have to admit that I was disappointed. My cat recently had kittens, and this book was no help at all. It has no section on pregnancy, only a very small section on breeding your cat for profit. Well, this was purely accidental, but I still wanted some help on caring for her during her pregnancy and labor, as well as some tips on caring for the kittens. It doesn't have anything like a section on kitten developmental stages. When do they eat solid food? When can I separate them from their mother? When should I get her fixed so we don't do this again? It also didn't have much on caring for sick or injured cats. What it did have, and I really didn't need, was a section on teaching your cat tricks. Hello! She's a cat, not a dog. I don't really need to teach her tricks. Of course, if you are interested, then this book may help. But it didn't have what I was looking for at all."
5,The Boy is BAAAAD!,"Excellent from ""Let's Get Started"" to ""Reflections"". You MUST put this one in your collection!!"
1,One and last Brian Culbertson album...,"Not only the songs here are low key, I think the lyrics and titles reads like it's for a soft porn movie. Check it out yourself.I am a long time jazz fan, loyal listener of jazz on radio and regular attendee at Jazz festivals. I wouldn't play this CD when my kids are at home."
5,Interpretative freshness!,"Brian Culbertson constitutes actually together with Gregg Karukas the best exponents of what versatility, innovation, and gifted inspiration signify.This album finds Culbertson in very good musical shape. There is a wide gamut of rhythms and sonorities that induce to dream even the most exigent listener.A very alluring album, where Sensuality detaches with Brian becomes the orchestra man, he plays the piano, trumpet, trombone, keyboards, synth bass, drum programming and percussion; the seductive track The way you feel comes supported by Boney James in tenor saxophone. Touch me is besides one of the finest tracks together with a song that seemed to be inspired in Erik Satie moods: Reflections.In despite the fact the year has elapsed in its three thirds parts it doesn 't seem exaggerated to affirm this album is from its release one of the ten best and most remarkable smooth jazz of the year.A magnificent choice for you and a wise gift for a beloved friend."
3,"Looks good, installs good, linited usefullness","My first impression was that this is an excellent choice for cup-holders for people like myself that own older cars. They are very easy to install and look good in the car. The problem comes when you try to use them. As long as you are using small to medium sized cups/bottles, you're ok but they will not accomodate either 16 oz. or 22 oz. water bottles.As long as you're ok with drinking ""Grande"" not ""Venti"" sized coffee and can live with 12 oz. water/drink bottles, these are well worth the money."
3,car cup holder,It looks good but is pretty small and only holds thin water bottles and I coldn't attach it to my air vents because when you put a water bottle in it it then blocks the vent. It does hold my cell phone though. I'm now looking for another one :(.
2,"OK, maybe","Very convenient if it fits. Be sure that you have clearance above.Some louvers will be too deep or too shallow to attach securely. It does not work on my Volvo 240.Depending on your vent louvers, it may not be stable enough. I would not drive with something large in it.It puts some stress on the louvers, so use on older, brittle plastic louvers may leave your latte in your lap."
2,Was a good thought!,"I thought I finally found the perfect cup holder..I actually bought some of these as gifts for my friends. I have a couple in my car..put wet wipes in them, my cell phone as well as my drink. Nothing heavy. After a month or so....the bottom slidder, that holds it in place, kept slipping and now won't hold any more..It would cost me too much to return them so I'm trying to rig them to make them work..What I thought was a good thing...turned out.....not so good!!!Not worth the money!"
5,"Great fun, and it gets you thinking","Lots to laugh about in this book. And lots to think about too. Wonderful for anybody. Great gift for a pastor, Sunday School teacher, or a friend who needs a few good chuckles."
1,Faulty Product,"I received a faulty copy twice and returned them -- the door latch was ineffective, and when the door is unlatched, the camera turns off. I finally accepted a ""working"" copy that rarely works after a month or so of use. It reports that my batteries are dead after only a few shots, when they are not. Other buyers have had similar problems. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,good product,Gret product the cost of it great compared with Canon. Quality is just the same but without the Canon brand name printed on the grip. Easy to use an installed.
4,Great alternative to Canon brand,This is a great alternative to the higher priced Canon battery grip. I have not used the Canon but the Opteka functions great at about half the price.
5,Opteka Battery Pack Grip for XT,This is a great product that works exactly and has the same quality as the original.
5,Exceptional Value,"I have to admit, I was very skeptical when I first saw this grip offered. I had intended on buying the OEM version, but decided it was cheap enough to take a chance. I can't express how glad I am that I did.The grip itself feels solid. I have not noticed any difference in the operation of the dial or the shutter release button (when compared to the camera).If you are looking for a battery grip and you are on a tight budget, I definitely recommend this one. You will not be disappointed."
1,"Mine didn't work, but I was able to return for a full refund!","With all the good reviews and a great price compared to OEM, I really wanted this product to work for me. Unfortunately, new batteries just wouldn't work after only about 10 shots or so. It was even worse if I used the AA battery adapter. Coundn't get off more than one or two shots. Glad to hear that it's worked for other folks, butI can't give it a better rating.To the credit of the supplier, I was able to return it for a full refund without any problems."
5,Saving my life,"On a recent trip to Philippines I forgot my battery charger in a hotel in Manila and noticed it only on Palawan island where there is not even a shop that sells Canon cameras, not to speak about accessories. Fortunately, I had 3 full batteries and somehow managed to survive. However, if I had a battery pack like Opteka it would have caused me no stress at all, for, in addition to Canon batteries, it takes regular AA batteries too which are abundant everywhere. It's very solidly built and now I am using it all the time. Very good thing."
1,"Buy the Canon Part, it is worth it.",I purchased this battery grip on december 15 and one of the buttons did not work out of the box. The rubber grip is also not very well glued and constantly needs to be smoothed out. I was willing to live with this stuff because the price is good and I had read of similar complaints in the other reviews. But the one problem I didn't find out about until recently is that it misreads the battery levels and causes the camera to shut down while the batteries still have enough charge to operate it. It also disrupts the use of the other Auto Focus button on the camera while the grip is turned on. I have since purchased the canon part and the Quality difference is immense in favor of the BG-E3.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I originally bought one of these because the price was so enticing. Initially, I was OK with the product, my only complaints being that the main dial was a bit soft and the shutter button was mushy, but I could live with those for the price. However, after a couple of days of use I noticed that the main dial would sometimes act funny. I generally shoot in aperture priority and sometimes the aperture would go the wrong way when I turned the main dial, even when using the main dial on the camera body itself. It took me a little bit, but I figured out that turning off the battery grip and turning it back on would fix it. I returned it for an exchange of the same product. The second one eventually did the same thing. I returned it as well and got the Canon battery grip instead. I just received it yesterday and so far I have been very pleased with it."
3,It's ok for handheld shooting. Don't mount it to a tripod!,"It's a decent copy of the canon grip. The rubber grip feels nice when handholding vertical shots, and I feel the extra weight on the body gives the camera a better balance for handholding shots. Shooting vertically just got a lot easier!That said, mounting this battery grip to a tripod is a whole different matter, which is critical to me since I mostly do landscape photography. Trying to mount the rebel/opteka to a tripod is basically futile if you don't use a cable release, because it wiggles so much. I've compared it against the genuine canon version, and the canon is definitely far sturdier than the opteka copy. Mounting the xt directly to the ballhead without the grip is rock solid, so I generally leave the grip at home now. Bonus is that it's lighter for hiking!If you only handhold, then this is a great deal. If you need to use a tripod often, I'd go ahead and get the canon version."
2,"***Great, but not perfect***","I recently got this order swiftly from 47th street. The service seemed to be very speedy and the product was in pristine condition.However, when I tried to use the vertical grip's shutter button, half-focus was fine, but suppressing for a full shot, there was at least 1 second lag. Nothing else but this problem thwarted me to contact their company for an immediate refund and probably buy the Canon version now.Although most people do not seem to have problems with theirs, please double check everything about our item before deciding that it is ""awesome."""
1,One of my rare mistakes :(,"I am not going to go into details just don't buy this junk and get a real grip, Canon, which I did after this one showed my batteries were gone in one click. No matter what I did it didn't work. A big disappointment. Sometimes you have to pay what you have to pay, so keep your money, save some more and get Canon. This WILL give you head ache."
4,Good accessory but.......,"I bought this BG-E3 compatible for my EOS 400D (or EOS Rebel Xti) and it has made my life better in terms of camera handling. However, after 2 months use, I felt the rubber part of the grip seems to be getting soft and loose. I compared it to the the original Canon BG-E3 of my friend who got his earlier than mine, the rubber part seems to be more sturdy and more in place. I guess thats what I get for buying a cheaper brand. Nevertheless, it still serves the purpose."
4,"Good, but don't use much","I bought this product based upon other reviews that recommended this as a must-have accessory. I haven't needed to use it much but it seems to work just fine. It makes the camera a little heavy, especially with a telephoto lens. I would definitely recommend this over the factory version--the quality is the same. but instead, I would recommend just buying a couple extra batteries and changing them out when you need to. Unless you're taking lots of flash shots, one battery works fine for several shoots."
4,A Must HAVE for Canon Rebel Cameras!,"This is a very nice addition to any Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT / XTi. I have the Rebel XT. The Opteka battery pack grip fits perfectly and all the buttons work as described. This makes your camera feel a bit weightier and allows your pinky finger to rest on something (the EOS Digital Rebel XT is a small camera). With 2 batteries this camera will last FOREVER.The only problem is - my lens (the Canon 28mm-105mm lens) now causes the camera to tip forward. This doesn't bother me as much but it may bother some because you can't set it on the table without resting on the lens.Fits perfect, assembly was 1-2 minutes (read the paper that came with it), and plug in the batteries and you're well on your way to shooting 1,100+ photos!"
3,"Nice, but could be better","I love the fit and feel of the battery pack grip. The only complaint I have is the flimsy little ""cartridges"" that the battery goes in. There's two of them. One for AA's and one for Canon-type batteries. They both feel like they could break if you looked at them hard enough, and there's no safe place to store one while you're using the other. I'd rather be able to load AA's like I do in my other ""real"" canon grip I have on my old Elan7.That being said, the grip feels great in your hand, adds a lot more grip to hold onto while using the cam., and you can't tell without looking really closely that the grip isn't an original part of the camera...it fits that well. Plus the rather large savings I got over buying the official Canon grip...that was a BIG plus.Highly recommend this Opteka grip to anybody wanting more power options, and a more secure grip on their cam. Plus, it just plain looks sexy on there...:)"
4,Good Buy,"This grip adds a nice balanced feel to your digi Rebel XT. The vertical shooting controls are comfortable and the dual batteries (not included) double the shooting capacity. It makes the camera feel more substantial and it fits my hands better.The manual indicates that this works with one battery, in case you don't want to spring for the extra battery right away-- I have not tested it that way, though.Mine does not have the yellow logo stamped on it (thank you) like the amazon photos show. Perhaps that is for illustrative purposes and to differentiate from Canon's product/photos.The bottom line is that this grip works well and is avalailble at a nice price compared to Canon's grip."
1,I don't believe this is a Canon in disguise,"Bought this in the first few months of 2007 due to price. Worked great, although I don't use my camera very much (once a month??). Then, in July, I noticed my camera frequently shutting off as I was composing a shot, or it just wouldn't turn on - a little frustrating. Took off the grip, and my XT has worked flawlessly, obviously there's an issue with a contact point somewhere.Even though this supposedly looks like a Canon product, I do no believe the quality is something Canon would put their name on. Yes, it's cheaper than Canon's product, but mine's now useless. Was it worth it? No. 1 star for price."
4,Nice,This thing is awesome. Only bad thing is the on/off switch seems a little loose and I inadvertently switch it on which makes some functions not work properly. The on/off is for the functions on the battery grip.
2,What you pay is what you get,"I bought this product based on the many positive reviews here and after receiving the item two days ago, I was disappointed. I know many of you have stated the same problems with this products. Here are my reasons for disappointment:Cheap construction quality.The plastic grip is peeling off!Buttons are mushy. The shutter button, when depressed fully, sinks deep into the body. You must glue something on it!I am returning this product and getting a Canon BG-E3.I am going to avoid buying cheap junk made in china from now on!!!I will pay a premium for a quality product."
4,Functional & Attractive,"The Opteka Battery Pack Grip transforms the Canon Xti, providing more power, and enhanced comfort, while saving the user substantial money as compared to the original equipment manufacturer's version. Slight drawback...the camera does not sit well with the small base, especially when longer lenses are attached, however this is a small price to pay for the added versatility and great looks of the grip."
2,Just a bit too boring,"My cousin gave me the book, I looked at it and said, ""I don't like love stories."" She told me it was also about God, and I decided to read it anyway. I started reading in May, I stopped probably 20 times to read more interesting books. I then stopped for about a month, but when I picked it up again I found out that the last 4 chapters are awesome, and the best part of the story. I loved the last 4 chapters, the rest drags on too much."
4,is whiteout illegal these days?,"Good luck trying to find white out in stores. I dont know if i just had bad luck, or its not sold over the counter anymore so Amazon to the rescue.The paint is nice and thick and dries quickly and has a bit of a unpleasant odor to it but nothing like what i remember. I am still on my first bottle and that is saying a lot, i make so many typos you'd think i was writing some foreign dilaect. Dielact. Deilact. Dialect."
5,Perfect Coverage And No Clumps,The coverage is excellent. The felt tips are much better than the brushes.Great control for even a small dot touch-up.
5,Great teaching,This was more for smaller children but still was usable. Will be good to pass on to home schoolers. Amen
4,An excellent addition to Christmas traditions!,The kindle version is easy to read. The information is practical and my kids love the activities.I would only add a few more pictures.
2,disappointed,I have Lisa's book called Creative Correction and love it so I was excited about a book of ideas for Christmas but I was very disappointed. It was a short book and didn't have many ideas. It is more a history book of Christmas than anything.
1,Not good for your e-reader,"I have read lots of good reviews on this book, and thought it would be great to read on my kindle. I can hardly read the print on my kindle, and the font size cannot be enlarged. Definitely would not recommend this for your kindle."
5,Great Book about Christmas,This is a great book to explain to children the Christian foundations of Christmas and Christmas traditions.
2,Not as great as I expected,"I was SO excited when this book arrived at my door, and continued to be so, even after reading the introduction.However, I am disappointed. I agree with another reviewer, that much of this book is trite, and even cheesy. I had hoped for devotionals tied into activities, and a daily format, that builds upon each day in Advent. It's more of a crafty history scrapbook for elementary-aged children. This is a book to borrow from the library, as a helpful, one-time reference for crafty ideas + history. I think I will purchase this one instead: http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Ready-Christmas-Yolanda-Browne/dp/0758608608"
2,"Not what I expected, either","This book does not have the depth I was hoping for. I like the idea of realizing that God can be find wherever you look for him. But, this book didn't live up to my expectations. The stories were a little trite for me."
5,I love the book!,"This book has history on many Christmas traditions that point to Jesus. You can tell you children stories about the Christmas tree, then another night about the candy cane, another about lights, etc. It was fun to make chocolate kiss advent calanders! We made the wassil recipe too. I will use this book annually!"
2,macintosh woodwick candle,"I was not very happy with this candle. I love the sound of the wick while burning, but if you are a scent fanatic, like me, you should look for another candle."
5,Quality!,"Worked great on my s-10 blazer, lifted the rear up like it should be and didnt make it ride like a lumber wagon so for that I was very pleased..."
1,Shame on Richard Galli!,"For Richard Galli to think of killing his son because he became paralyzed is bad enough, but to write a book about it too is over the top! Who does he think he is to make the decision that, because his son's body is no longer perfect, he shouldn't be allowed to live? Are disabled people less than human? Unable to enjoy life?This book is revolting."
5,Great Study For Group Or Individual,"This wasn't our first SN book, and we continue to really enjoy them. All of the varied aspects of information really help you get into the context and better understand the exegesis of the text. Love the action-packed stories of J&J."
3,Too Basic,"I would not waste my money on this book. If the price would have been $4.00, then it may have been a good buy. Maybe I was expecting too much but it only covers the bare basics of note writing etiquette."
1,"Slow, slow, slow","This book is a waste of time and money. I bought it because I like stories about cryptozoology. I bought this thinking it was going to be a story like Steve Alten's The Loch. Not only wasn't it about a lake monster like the title says, it was so slow I thought I'd never finish it. To me, if this book had been free instead of $2.99, I wouldn't have finished it. Looking back now I wish I hadn't. It was a waste of my time."
4,Lovecraftian,The Dunwich Horror meets Rosemary's Baby. The story takes an unexpected twist with an ending that may not please all but pleases the true Lovecraft fan.
5,Be careful what you look for,"Nothing ,including the book itself, is as it seems and what everyone is searching for[including the reader] might turn out to be unexpected. Mysterious...yes. An excellent read. Buy it, but leave expectations behind and just flow with this uncanny story."
1,waste,Lets keep it short don't waste your time this book is a real letdown. This is the best you can do?
5,JR,Wow this was a Honda filter and it was about 20 times less than a Honda air filter. Had I known this my last stop at the dealership I coulkd have saved about $50.00
4,They Last,I am a lineman and i have had these pants for a year now and they are still in good shape. small pocket perfect for cell phone toughest pants i have ever owned
4,Good Pants,Seems to be well-made and the fit is good. Minus one star for front pockets that are somewhat too tight and small.
3,CLASSIC AND FAVORITE,"MY HUSBAND LOVES DICKIES, AND HE REALLY LIKED THESE. HE WEARS HIS PANTS LOOSE, AND WE BUY SZ 38'S ALL THE TIME, BUT FOR SOME REASON THESE 38'S ARE VERY SNUG AROUND HIS THIGHS, SO WE HAVE TO SEND THEM BACK AND GET A BIGGER SIZE. IF YOU ARE A MAN WHO WANTS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE AND LIKE AIR CIRCULATION THEN I SUGGEST YOU GO ABOUT A SIZE BIGGER IN THESE."
2,Not true to size,"This is our second of these pants. Not sure what's going on, but they seem to be the same work pants my husband buys at the local store. However the store and even online these ""Dickie Ducks"" aren't readily available. We tried the 36 waist, way too big. So we tried the 34 waist way too small. what's the deal. 36's are normally what fit him just right. Sure wish they would have worked. It's costing me a fortune in shipping, so I give them only a 2 star rating because the sizing is so off from ""normal."""
5,re.dickies carpenter jean.,hi.dickies jeans are well worth buying.they will last a long time compared to other jeans.they also ware good.they deserve a five star rating because of what they are.thanks.
4,Order a size larger in waist,"I love these jeans for the cost and durability, but as others have commented, definitely order an inch larger in the waist than other jeans that you own, especially allowing for shrinkage. I have just purchased two pair and instead of sending them back I'm using them as an incentive to lose weight. :-)"
3,Too tight in upper legs for large men,My husband wears a 48/30 but these pants fit VERY tight in his upper thigh. They are too tight for comfort and he feels very insecure with every fold of skin visible as they hug in all the wrong places. If you have thick upper thighs these pants are not for you.
3,nice material,the fit was good but there are not enough belt loops on the back side. go get a real job
5,GREAT!,They were bought for my husband and he has enjoyed them. They are good quality and comfortable! Great price too!
5,Good Pants,"Sizing is right. Cut is right. Quality is right. They seem to be first rate REAL Dickies. The canvas is not as thick as the ones I get from Sears, but is sturdy and well-stitched. The fit is FAR better than the ones I got from KMart, the fit is right."
3,"Cute, but not very durable","The watch is extremely cute, and I loved it for the month that it worked. Why it broke is beyond me - a crack appeared around the time that it stopped working, so that might have had something to do with it. It did break fairly quickly, but I can't say I was particularly careful with it."
3,poor,"(a) I like the manufacturer Mophie, because of their responsive to the customer, but (b) The product badly needs improvement. This webpage claims, ""ultra secure spring loaded clip"", but the reality is that the clip is fairly weak -- it's strong enough for walking around, but when i put the clip on my shorts waistband and jogged, the clip and music player eventually worked their way loose and fell on the concrete, twice; it's a bit more secure if you place the clip near your hip where the waistband bounces up and down less than does the front of the waistband. And when I did vigorous exercise the clip and music player fell on the concrete several times. A truly strong clip for the Nano is atMatias Armor Clip and Anchor for iPod Armor."
4,A short and sweet book.,"The blue lion-like Lehr cats are worshiped as gods on their world. When the interstellar Empire requires the use of the cats for diplomatic purposes, four of these are shipped off on a luxury space cruiser against the vehement protests of the natives. Careful precautions are taken to keep both the crew and the invaluable feline cargo safe, but this all seems for naught when clawed-up corpses start appearing, with hands still clutching blue fur....This is a very entertaining novel. Not a masterpiece, but makes for an easy, quick and fun read."
4,Cool novel,"This is a good novel - though maybe one more for the kids. I read it years ago, but when I saw it 2nd hand I had to buy it. Fairly good plot devices and writing, though you may have to read it twice to understand it all. A very good read, however, I feel it is not her best."
3,Fire Won't Turn Of The Heat...,Album has a nice vibe to it... Nothing much to say jus got it for collection sakes... It was recomended by a friend from the UK...Mokgabudi
4,AZ's Finest,"These four young brothers have the right name they are hot. Coming from Phoenix, AZ Heat is surely on the rise. With a style the emulates Next they sure have their own unique style and sound. From club bumpin beats like Can I Have This Dance to hot nicety slow cuts like Innermostess Moistness....whew saying that gets me amped...and women wil too. Heat delivers. I know them personaly and they are very down to earth. I recommend this cd for true R&B new swing listeners."
3,Nice to listen to.,This is nice to listen to but I was wanting a CD of call and response chanting for the purpose of chanting with friends.
4,Worth including in your collection,"I have other Jai Uttal releases, but this has a twist, and is well worth adding to you collection."
3,"Nice, but not relaxing music... too bollywood",This is ok but it's not very relaxing... I would classify this music as a bollywood soundtrack.
2,Great CD but it was scratched upon arrival,"I love the cd, John Williams is one of my favorites, the cd was scratched when I opened it though. Can't listen to part of the cd."
3,Poor selection...,"Personally, i bougth this CD because i want the official Olimpic Himn, and i thougth this CD include that. Wrong! This fantastic music is not hear. Why? So the selection is not the best! Despite, the quality of the recording and musical direction is very good. The Olympic Spirit is the best theme in the seleccion, Bernstein`s Olimpic Himn is a deception! In the rest, they are good music between same eroded and ""dejá vu"" themes."
5,One of the most uplifting and motivating albums!!!,"When I first listened to this album, I was in awe of the beauty and grandness of the music composed/performed by John Williams. John can make composing music an exalted art. His music is purely genius and captures the ideas of the album in which the score is in. Back to the album . . . it is AWESOME! This includes many well-known songs but also many undiscovered treasures. Of the twelve songs, I especially enjoyed:Track One-Summon the HeroesTrack Three-Bugler's Dream/Olympic Fanfare and ThemeTrack Twelve-The Olympic SpiritBottom Line: BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!! A TREASURE!!!!!"
4,Good CD,"The music you hear on the NBC Olympic broadcasts is pretty much all on this disc.One problem is that on the O Fortuna track, the volume from 00:23 to 01:38 is really low for some reason. Almost inaudible for that section of the song."
5,Awe Inspiring and Generally Great.,"Having listened to this entire CD, and being a musician from the Boston area, I can't help but praise John Williams and the Pops for an excellent compilation of hero-inspired music. Track 10 - ""Toward a New Life"" is absolutely wonderful... and the ""Parade of the Charioteers"" actually made me want to get up and march around the living room!!"
4,Good collection,"Most of the tracks on this CD are good, but it is Williams' contributions that make it worth buying. The one you will be most intersted in is track 3 which has the music most used in the intro to the Olympics on NBC: ""Bugler's Dream"" and ""Olympic Fanfare and Theme"". You also hear them sometimes use ""Summon the Heroes"". The others I have not heard used in Olympics recently, and I think Carmina Burana is out of place (but you should know I'm not fond of the piece either)."
4,Quick read,"Perhaps nothing more to add to the first two reviewers (with whom I agree with) other than to state that this book allows one to consider the importance of the West to the Confederates' cause. While I believe the first three chapters are nothing more than entertaining, at best, the last chapters are more worthwhile to a student of the Civil War. I found myself agreeing with some of McMurry's thesis while arguing with others. But as the author states, what better way to stir the discussion about how and why the Confederacy lost the war. If you are considering buying this book I would encourage it, for it caused me to delve in further into the subject, yes, by buying other books referenced."
4,good basic information,good basic information about the islands. it was very helpful in choosing which location to say. wish there was more details though.
5,Good Book,We've checked this book out at the library before coming to Guam. There was a copy of it at our lodging place when we arrived. Now we need to have one of our own so that we know the in's an out's of Guam for our guests.
5,intriguing,"A very interesting and beautifully written book. The trilogy is about Alaskans Natives who are story tellers. You begin to feel for the characters and dream with them. I wish that American youth would be required to read these books and other stories like these, so that our young generation would have a better understanding about Native American's culture and past.Sue Harrison is an extremely creative and intelligent writer, you should read all of her books."
5,Call Down the Stars,I have read all of Sue Harrison's books and wait for the next one. Very discripitve and carries you along at a fast pace. Start it and you don't want to put it downk
4,wings is still a great flyover,"Ok, wings was ending. But the show was still going strong imo. Most of the episodes are very good and a few that are average. which is just about what you would expect. I can't say that I disliked a episode of this show ever. And I watch it in hd on reelz satellite or cable network. Wings was one of the better sitcoms of it's era and it still could be a hit today. This dvd set is bare bones but if you collect the show you want it."
5,Fantasic patterns,"I bought this because others raved about it (corsetry forums on LiveJournal) and i loved all the patterns it provided - just was i was looking for!!To be honest, i copied all the patterns then passed the book on with out really reading it as id rather watch dvds with fashion history in it than read about it! haha too tedious for me. But heaps of pics and interesting text (what others read and shared with me) But i loved the patterns. I didnt have too much trouble redrafting from the patterns provided and piccs helped to get the overall shape. :)"
4,great overview,"Corsets & Crinolines is great for many corset, hoop & bustle patterns, and will work well for most of your historic costuming needs, (1600-1920). Really great for 17 & 1800's.The patterns are easy to scale up & the diagrams are very helpful for the finished product.Here is a list of the patterns in the book:early 1600's body, 1630 bodice, 1650 boned bodice lining, 1702 stays, 1730-40 stays, 1776 1/2 boned stays, 1780 1/2 boned stays, 1793 short stays, 1790's short stays, 1740 Hoop petticoat, 1760 pocket hoops, late 1820's stays, 1844 corset, 1860 corset, 1873 corset, 1880's corset, mid-1890's corset, 1901 corset, 1911 'corset', 1904 ribbon corset, 1918 girdle, 1925 corset, 1864 crinoline, 1872 crinoline (with bustle), 1876 bustle.An experienced costumer may be able to gain more patterns from the other illustrations. The section on how to make corsets is a must-read for anyone interested in constructing these garments.Ms. Waugh's sources are always entertaining & excellent!"
4,Wonderful Book!,"I had to use this book for my final project in my Costume Technologies class and I loved it! I made the 18th century woman's stays (1776) and they worked out wonderfully!Warning, though: this book is not for people who cannot draft costumes. The patterns are in miniature and are original period patterns; in other words, they will not be sized for you. You will have to draft and make many a mock-up before you are ready to make the actual piece.All in all, I love this book and intend to make even more of the pieces in it!"
3,"Mediocre layout, good pictures, terrible organization","Filled with images from primary resources, this book covers numerous details about these interesting undergarments, from patterns that help show the anatomy to pictures of them in use to caricatures, fashion plates, pictures of extant costumes--there is plenty to see in this book. The written content features the thoughts of contemporaries, quotations from famous figures, and some text by the author explaining usage, construction, styles, etc.One major problem with the book is its organization. It is not chronological; it jumps back and forth with no apparent reason, and it makes things difficult for someone who is less familiar with changing styles. Also, the quotations do not always seem relevant or even that interesting. It is an ok resource on corsets, but it's not one of the best. I would suggest looking around for something better."
4,Great for weddings,Just like it says. Nice soft slow music for weddings. I'm going to have it played while our guests are arriving to church. Very romantic music. Definitely recommend.
1,The Headhunter's Guide to Technical Recruiting,"As soon as I received this book, I mailed it back to Amazon in disgust. The title of the book is very misleading ""The complete guide to Technical Recruiting"". First of all, it's not a book, it's a binder bound literature. As I browsed through this so called ""book"", it mostly talked about how to be a more effective headhunter."
4,Outstanding guide for a newbie,"I bought this book after comming out of the military and entering into the recuriting field. I found it to be a very helpful, and I use it on a daily basis, particularily the check lists enclosed. I believe that the methods to prepare candidates for face to face interviews are outstanding, however it would be benificial if there was a telephone interview preparation sheet. Additionally, a section on overcomming objections would be useful, however this is not a sales book, it is a book to help you create and manage the process of recruiting. As far as the typos go, who cares? Pay attention to the content delivered, and not the author's ability to type. He is teaching recruiting, not English. Like any other guide on how to do anything, this is based on the author's opinions and his experience. It should be used in conjuncture with other materials to form your own style and methods."
1,"Lots of words, but says little","I sent this book back from whence it came. It was of no value to me. So full of typographical errors, poor writing, contradictions, and fantasies that I could not accept it as any help at all. Buy some other book, not this one."
1,Does not deliver what it promises,"I was disconcerted to find a very substandard book instead of what I had expected. I had ideas of receiving a really helpful book to make me a better technical recruiter, but I received a book of personal opinions and theoretical protocols that even I know better than to try, and I am pretty new at this. Luckily I had bought 3 books, and one of the others is outstanding. Don't bother with this one."
1,Save your money,"I am brand new to Technical Recruiting after spending time as a military recruiter and I bought this book hoping it would better explain this brand new world of IT. My company knew of my shortcomings and said they would train me, but we have been so busy and my training has taken a backseat. I wanted to buy this book to start teaching myself so that I could contribute. This book talked nothing of the specific IT jobs nor did it explain anything about the SDLC. Basically, I was looking for Technical Recruiting 101 and thought the ""The Complete Guide to Technical Recruiting"" would be just what I needed. Sadly to say, this book just didn't measure up."
1,"GARBAGE, I AM NOT IMPRESSED","By far the worst ablum he has ever even thought of,and will be one of the most biggest dissapointments in recent memory, Just horrible. Mr. Bridges, I am ashamed, go back to studio now, and ask for fogivness."
1,Rap is so gay,How can anyone listen to this? This guy needs his #$# kicked big time. Rap is so old! Mouths to feed? Woozy? Hahaha! Please loser. I don't know how anyone takes this stuff seriously anymore.....
2,Maybe too many too soon...,"Luda has the talent and the mic skills, but this one does not hit all cylinders from his earlier work...maybe too much too soon; he has the energy and the acting...future LL COOL J follower."
4,My favorite Ludacris album,"Although this may not be a popular opinion, I firmly believe that Release Therapy is Ludacris' strongest album. It comes at the peak of his musical maturity, a time when he transitioned from pioneer of Dirty South to a more independent styled that merged his lyrical roots with mainstream, conscious, and more understated styles. His lyrical skill is still top-shelf, and he still retains his signature, eclectic voice in topics ranging from unemployment to parenthood. My biggest issue is that the weak tracks in the album are VERY weak, but I've erased these from my memory (and music collection). Favorite tracks: ""Warning (Intro)"", ""Grew Up a Screw Up"", ""Mouths to Feed"", ""War With God""."
2,what the ****???? HAPPENED!!!,WHERE'S THE OTHER LUDACRIS...THE REAL ONE? THIS ALBUM IS HIS WORST YET!
3,Mediocre,"Not as hard hitting as Luda's other CD's like Red Light District. But a good buy anyway if you can get it discounted. Has good songs like ""runaway love"" and ""grew up a screwup"". Just decent."
3,....,"This is the first time I listened to a whole Ludacris album so I'm very new to Ludacris but I sure wasn't dissapointed.I knew about Ludacris for a long time but I finally decided to give his albums a listen and this is the first one.I thought he was going to be another same ol' rapper that we have seen for a long time, just rapping about sex and how great he is.Money Maker is the most commercialise song in this album and for me its those songs that doesnt appeal to me.But there was 2 special songs in the album that were just flawless which led me to give huge respect to Ludacris.Runaway Love (fea. Mary) / I love this song it shows that Ludacris can be creative in storytelling with raps.Grew Up A Screw Up (fea. Y. Jeezy) / Just greatI also enjoy the idea that he had fun with songs such asSlapFreedom Of Preachetc.Verdict 3.4 out of 5.0 I'm not dissapointed in this album. It was a great listen."
4,Another Solid Relaese,"I've been a fan of Ludacris since back for the first time and have tracked his ""progression"" through all of his previous LP's. This album marks yet another solid step therein. Its very good, there are no real throw-away tracks, and at least for me ""War With God"" and ""Tell It Like It Is"" stand out as particularly good. There are the requiste club bangers (""Money Maker"" & ""Girls Gone Wild"") and songs that fans of luda's previous albums will be sure to appreciate (""Mouths to Feed"" & ""Do Your Time""). All in all, while there is nothing industry changing about this album it is another quality album in a series of consistantly quality albums from cris. If you liked his previous stuff definately pick it up, if not it's still worth a listen if you have the oppertunity."
3,Same Formula Release,"Well, in my humble opinion this album is not really a catastrophe but I certainly wouldn't call it a masterpiece either. Ludacris proves to be fantastic with his wordplay and lyrics but nevertheless falls short everytime with the same old formula and introduction. I just wish he would've given us more....:) But I still love Luda!!!"
4,Look At Time Time To Rise!!!,"The new Ludacris is actually spitting and not worrying about having hit singles. The ""big"" singles would almost always steal the spotlight on all of his CD's. Overall this is a nice CD. As for Time To Rise, do you feel smart when you say that you don't like rap? I bet you and your emo friends chat online about how rap is wack. Keep having the posterboys of your music (Panic At The Disco and Fallout Boy) represent what your ""people"" listen to. You don't see any hip hop fans track down an artist and flame them on Amazon . What does that say about you and how much time you spend on the computer? Go wear black and post some poems on Myspace."
4,ReleaseTherapy,"I love luda, however; I have been waiting for an album form him where he just speaks his mind. I can say without a dought Luda is one of the if not the best Rapper in the Game. He has shown me that he can step out of what people think he should do and be something unseen by many. So, big up to Luda. Also, I love the track with him and Bishop Long."
2,What happened? Luda!!!!,"Ludacris has dropped release therapy, which IMHO is just that release. therapy. This album is not his best, or even second. I was rather dissapointed and confused listening to the album. The beats and rhymes seem off. Being a native Atlantan, from the SWATS (grew up with the Outkast, Goodie MOB, Ludacris, etc) I felt like the air let out a ballon this one. I hate to give bad reviews, but I...oh forget it. This album could and should have been much better. I would firmly suggest to just download the hottest track, Money Maker. The rest..well try BEFORE you buy!"
4,Very helpful to the color-confused!,"I bought this book to help me choose a paint for a central room in my house easily viewable from several different living areas. Plus, if you and your partner need to come to agreement, the book puts an ""approved"" stamp on several different combinations and that cuts down on the intense discussions families can get into when it is time to paint!Don't buy this book if you don't like color and aren't willing to be adventurous. Perhaps Ms. Gill's Color Harmony: Naturals would be more your ticket.Thanks, Ms. Gill. I loved the book and can't wait to try out my selections."
2,Useless,This book had absolutely no value for me. I was looking for something to help me coordinate existing colors and bring them together with the use of color. None of the colors are shown in examples. There are just pages and pages of blocks with colors in them. One of the worst books I have ever purchased.
2,This book will tell you nothing you don't already know,"If you have followed the career of Pearl Jam for the past few years I do not reccommend purchasing this book. It seems the writer took all his information from magazine sources, newspaper articles and other media documents. Basically any fan who has followed the band should already know everything in the book."
3,"entertaining, but nothing new","This book was captivating enough for me to read in one night- but, then again I'm a huge PJ fan. Although the book was entertaining, I found that I really didn't learn anything that I didn't already know (which shouldn't have been the case). The author did little original research or interviews for the book, and instead relied almost entirely on already published magazine articles (90% of which I had already read). The book is chronologically well- organized, but I was surprised to see at least one guaranteed error (The author says that Stone lent his vocals to ""Hail Hail"", instead of ""Mankind"".)I got that same feeling I get when I am reading a concert or album review by someone who knows nothing about the band- but is pretending to sound knowledgeable anyway.The Bottom Line: The author should have been more active in researching. He should be telling me things that I don't know, and not vice- versa. But... it is entertaining- and a good chronology of the band."
3,Chronicles the Rise of an Underdog,"A slim 160-page volume packed with black and white photos chronicling the rise of an underdog staying power of a band Kurt Cobain once criticized (and later reversed his sentiments) for creating corporate grunge. Through public disagreements with Nirvana, boycotts of Ticketmaster, and changing band members, Clarke covers all the bases."
2,It was a very undetailed book.,This book was very undetailed. It was barely good enought for the average rock fan let a lone an average Pearl Jam fan. I could have edited it better myself. The grammar was horribly written and the whole book was taken from quotes from other magazines. If you just want to know the basics of the band then read this book.
3,The Anglo-American War of 1812-1815.,"I think the previous reviewer hit it on the head in regards to this book. It accurately details the history and nature of this war, but it is so dry and fact based, that it was a difficult read. This book of 10 chapters and 250 pages is chock full of info, but it does not convey any good reader interest. It is hardly a page turner. I have read some books twice the size of this book in half the time. Other criticisms of this book is that it details the movement of troops and sometimes one cannot figure out whether the author is talking about the British or Americans. In one instance, it talks of a tactical retreat by the British to Burlington, Vermont when the author meant to say Burlington, Ontario. That confused this reader.If one whats information on this important war, one should look elsewhere. This book is full of info, it just not interest the regular lay reader. Look elsewhere for a better book."
5,Great product,"Love this unit, easy to install and works great. So much better than the turk unit I had before."
1,It would have been awesome if I actually got the right thing!,I ordered this item from a 3rd party seller after being told by Best Buy that this was the item I needed for my Pioneer AVH-P2400BT. I received the item and went to have it installed on Sunday by Best Buy and was informed that I was scammed by the seller. The item in the box was not the Pioneer GEX-P920XM. It is an old discontinued XM-RVR-FM-001 Commander that retails for $25! I paid over $80 for an item that I can't even use! Please beware of who you buy from on here! I will now be out the $80 I was scammed out of on top of what it costs to buy the new tuner I need and have it installed. Overall I am not happy!
1,Audiovox?,Antenna is very small. The wire had already lost its insulation.It is not heavy duty as it should be. My XM sound quality is not as good as radio.
2,not ready for prime time,"One of my primary stations becomes a fringe station at the end of my commute. With FM I hear a little static, with HD it has an echo repeat echo that is much worse than a little static. I regret the $80 that I spent on this adapted, I'm not going to dig it out of the dash and send it back but I can't stand to use it on the way to work."
5,Avid D3 + Pioneer GEX-P920XM XM Satellite Tuner,"This has been a great buy. Im glad that i was purchased this. I would highly suggest it. Simple instillation, and comes with everything needed to operate unit."
4,Plug and Play FTW,This was a lot easier to install than I thought it would be. Total time was about 30 minutes... Well after my dash was opened up.
4,"Confusing at times, but always profound.",I thought this was a great book for anyone thinking about some of life's most difficult questions. Dillard captures the vastness of nature within these few pages.
4,Good essays by talented writer,"I am a co-leader of our church's book club, and appreciate the speed with which youdelivered the collection of Annie Dillard's essays. I already knew about book andauthor and my primary goal was to get a copy promptly, which you provided."
5,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe...oh, it hurts...it hurts...it actually hurts!"
3,An interesting look at pre-legalization abortion,"This is a must-read for feminists, pro-choicers, pro-lifers, and activists involved in the area of women's health. Information on this book's subject matter is frequently hard to come by, and this is told from the perspective of someone who was there as events unfolded. ""The Story of Jane"" is a striking example of how women can care for eachother in traumatic situations, and educate their sisters about their bodies, in a way that the often too clinical medical profession does not manage. An interesting look at grass-roots organizing and the politics of the pre-Roe era."
5,Required reading for women who did not live through the Pre-Roe decades,"As a child of the 80s, I have had the privilege of existing only in a world with legal abortion. The Story of Jane introduced me to the realities of the pre-Roe era that I only vaguely knew about from films like ""Dirty Dancing"" or ""Cider House Rules"". I couldn't put it down."
3,Possible Sugarcoating?,"This was interesting, but I really feel the book probably sugarcoated a lot. the author had an agenda, and I can easily see her modifying the facts to suit it. The truth is, these women were doing abortions without medical degrees and sending women home, in most cases, with hardly any follow up and no knowledge of how they fared afterwards. god knows how many women had problems that they never even knew about.Also, this book never gets into what the abortion procedure really entails. The fact is, these women were pulling the arms and legs off of babies, and inducing miscarriages where little babies were being born dead or dying. They saw the bodies of dismembered children every day. Yet the author presents them as selfless heroes. I think she engaged in a lot of self-righteous sugarcoating."
3,A fascinating account,"Though clearly romanticized and seen through the rose-colored glasses of hindsight, The Story of Jane tells a tale of women running a criminal abortion syndicate for ideological rather than financial motives. The author's treatment of Harvey Karman (whom she identifies as ""Jordan Bennett"") overlooks the less savory aspects of his career, such as his conviction in the death of a woman in a motel-room abortion in Los Angeles, and leaves this reader wondering what else she chooses to gloss over. Nevertheless, the book is an interesting and insightful read, and worth the trouble for prolifer and prochoicer alike."

3,is it salt,it was cheaper then petsmart and only 8$ more then reg instant ocean salt.... it came in a reef crystal box but in the box was just 4 clear bags that said nothing... for all i know it's white sand.... or reg salt..
1,Bad purchase,"Product did not pro form the way it was suppose to. It must have been defective.because I now know that I am not the only one that had a problem with this product.',,,,,,,,,BBW"
3,Not Really,Not so bright after all. The GigLight is much brighter and provides much better coverage on the music stand.
1,It's Dead Jim... After Only A Month And A Half,"I liked the nice bright even light this light threw, until something inside gave a loud (and very startling) POP and power diminished by half resulting in dim unusable light. Replacing the batteries made no difference. All three bulbs are lit, just they are now on permanent half power. The battery contacts and switch were always a bit touchy, but usually worked fine."
5,A life saver,I received a free bottle of Childrens Advil to sample from Smiley 360.com.Shortly thereafter my son developed a fever of 106 and we had to take him to the ER where he was given a shot of antibiotics to quickly lower his temp.The next day his 104 temp was quickly lowered by Childrens Advil.He took it like a champ too.It works very fast and lasts long! Thank you Advil and Smiley 360.com
5,One of the Greatest Coloraturas Ever,"I highly recommend this 2cd set of the superlative american soprano June Anderson for your opera and vocal collection.The singing here is of a much higher standard that what you will hear in most opera houses of the world today.June brings these arias to life with a solid technique, breath control, and performs them with high intelligence, dedication and feeling for the text, and excellent diction.And her high notes are spectacular.Gorgeous and highly technical singing of famous french & italian arias!This is a beautiful cd collection, long out of print, so get it while you still can.June really dazzles here with high wire skills."
4,relaxing yet engaging,"Here's a nice ambient CD chock full of analog goodness. Thick textures swirl and evolve. The music can sit in the background, but it rewards your attention with unexpected sounds and shifts of color. The songs take their time to build and resolve without ever feeling like they're just meandering. Take a listen, your patience will be rewarded."
3,Its ok,"I liked they way it looked in the picture- but unfortunatly, it has only about half the detail that it shows.I won't complain though- it did effectively hold my pants up!RatATatter<;""3)~~~"
1,How Do I Hate This? Let Me Count The Ways.....,"There are many soporific compilations out on all the major labels and most of the minor ones, too. If you avoid the blandness of Marriner on Philips, the slick emptiness of Karajan on DG and EMI, and the sight-reading of starving Eastern Europeans on the white box labels, you can do pretty well.But above all, be sure to avoid this one. The performances are usually slack (without pulse, purpose or payoff) and always swollen and self-indulgent. It's interpretations like this that give Romanticism a bad name.And though the New York Philharmonic plays very well, the recording quality is coarse and artificial, often combining overly close miking and chaotic reverberation. Volume Two is no better.""Gee, I guess he didn't like it.""Keep looking."
5,Excellent,"At our medical school Robbins basic pathology is the recommended text and I was very skeptical before starting this book. But believe me this book is really nice and I excelled in my pathology class reading this text only. No robbins for me. This book is what it says- Concise, but also what it does not say- Relevant, succint and crammable.I say so because I have read this book cover to cover and revised it in 3 days prior to exam. Everything is sorted out."
5,Love this brand of correction pen,"In the past, I've gotten this pen. Therefore, I know it has good durability. Usually, these pens last me several months. I write a lot of my notes in ink. This is perfect for helping me correct my work. Recently, I bought this set from Amazon. The time that I bought it, I believe it was on sale with free shipping ($5.00 + free shipping). I considered that an excellent deal. If you go to the grocery store and try to buy this, you will probably have to pay $7 per pen, at least the last time I checked.The ink flows very smoothly out of these pens, right out of the box. As long as you properly cap the pen, you should have no problem, in my experience, with the liquid drying out."
2,Hard to Use,"I found this product hard to use. I had to squeeze hard, and not much fluid would come out. In theory, you should be able to get a fine line of correction fluid, covering just what you need, as opposed to the larger swatch that comes with a brush; but it wasn't worth the effort, and it dried up and wouldn't come out at all some time later. I'm back to using the kind with a brush..."
2,No way..,"I will stick with the little bottle and brush - this thing globs up, doesn't flow right and I have to squeeze it to the point where I was afraid it would pop from the pressure. No thanks lol."
2,"pen works well, cap is loose and falls off","If the cap on this pen worked better it would be a 4-5 star device. I like the way it works -- you do have to squeeze it a little but the flow of cover-up is easy to control.Unfortunately the cap is always falling off, including in my pocket. I have tossed out several because the cap got lost."
5,Great example of a great American musical!,"When I watch a musical I want to be entertained and this movie is very entertaining. When you combine the talents of Betty Grable with the escapism of a South Seas set you have a formula of great cinema. Be it a little campy it's campiest at its best. Also a measure of good film quality is the enduring story and production values. I enjoyed watching this movie as a boy just as I enjoyed watching it last week, many years later. Like music, that is a way to judge if you have a classic. From a historical prospective this is a great example of this genre."
3,Enjoyable,"I was looking for something with Hawaiian music, and there was a good bit of it in the movie. Also wanted to see Betty Grable, as I couldn't remember ever seeing her in a movie. Just a lighthearted musical-comedy."
3,disappointing compared to TV version,"I have always thought this to be one of Betty Grables best movies, remembering it as I did from television showings from several years ago. However, this version of the film is shorter than it should be, and it seems that one of the songs, 'Blue Shadows and White Gardenias' has actually been cut from the release print in this recording. You can even tell where it should have been!There is another version of this film available, and I would go for this one (with a different cover design) rather than the one pictured."
2,Song of the islands,"I love Betty Grables films, but this one I was'nt too keen on,it didn't have a much of a story to it really, sorry."
3,Slowly but surely!,"This movie was slow to the point and lacked excitement. But there was only one scene that I chuckled on, it was when the old hawaiian lady's uncle; chewed on a leg from an animal. As he took a bite, he crunched on the bones of the leg; looking like a wildman with a wild eyed stare at the visitor of the island. Turned out that the old lady's uncle was a cannibal. The only thing that kept this movie from dying out, was the dancing and singing from Betty Grable, and the old Hawaiian lady."
3,Pleasant Enough Time Waster,Betty Grable sings. Victor Mature is shirtless in some scenes. Jack Oakie annoys. The scenery is beautiful. Nothing special. Just a pleasant enough time waster.
2,not one of her best,"As an Eileen Dreyer fan, I was sadly disappointed with this book. The rapid, choppy, hospital slang was hard to read. Timmie was not a very sympathetic character, and the other characters were so alike I had a hard time keeping straight who was who."
3,"Good, but not the best mystery I've ever read","I am a fan of mysteries, and this sounded like a good one, but it was not the best. The real mystery and suspense didn't seem to begin until about halfway through the book. Often times, I felt like I had missed something when Timmie came to a conclusion. Also, I found this book to involve lots of lingo involving medicine and certain medications that I knew nothing about. The characters were interesting, and multi-layered, and the plot was good enough to keep reading, but I would not recommend it if you don't know about medicine and certain medications and what they do. If you are a doctor, a nurse, or someone else well versed in medicine, you will probably enjoy and understand this book much more than I did."
4,Simple but elegant Italian cooking,"This book features an excellent range of homey Italian dishes. The recipes for vodka pasta, eggplant parmesan, and saffron butterflies are all favorites in our house. The author's explanations of ingredients are very helpful."
5,Patricia Wells' Trattoria,"This is an excellent, clear, easy to follow collection of Italian recipes. Every process has a reason and thorough instructions. In the first week, I created three lovely meals from this book. Fresh flavors for our meals! Wonderful!"
4,"Quite a book, indeed!","If you've ever had the chance to travel in Italy, you know the wonderful world of the little, out-of-way family restaurant or Trattoria and the marvelous food serve there. This book is a virtual tour of such eateries!"
5,The best of the bunch,"My personal bias is this is her best recipe book - simple recipes that are delicious and easy to make, especially if you love Italian food."
4,Beware of the Ragu Recipe,"I lived in Italy for more than a dozen years, and Trattoria is the cookbook I most often give as a gift. Its great draw is speed and simplicity. That said, one must beware of Wells' recipe for Ragu. She uses 46 oounces of crushed tomatoes for less than a pound of meat and wants us to believe this concoction will be ready in 20 minutes. Huh? No way! Otherwise, the book's terrific, especially for beginning cooks."
4,Enjoyable gaming expirence,"This game is simple but fun,fun,fun !The built in mp3 player is a really neat feature as well."
5,Works perfectly,"I'm using this with Asterisk and a cheap cordless phone for VoIP. It works flawlessly. I can make and receive calls, use call waiting, etc. It meets all expectations."
2,Not so good. Already on my second RMA,"I bought it new in October, 2006. I noticed that the unit got hot after powering it for a while. It was working for about a month then it started causing loud static noises on the line. I called D-Link and got a RMA#. They replaced it with another unit which did not work right out of the box. The replacement unit stopped giving dial-tone when I put the SIP server information. Now, I am getting a replacement for a replacement. Already wasted some $ on the return shipping making this thing more expensive than it is."
4,"Okay, I've only used it once so far, but. . .","I just used this blade for the first time and loved it so much I felt compelled to immediately log on and review it. It was uber convenient, cut my shaving down to half the usual time and I got a really nice, close shave.Having logged on, however, I see that folks had less than extraordinary experiences with this blade after use #1, so instead of the 5 stars I initially wanted to give it, I'll give it 4. I so hope that I don't encounter their issues on shaves 2-4 w/ this.We'll have to see. . ."
2,not worth the money!,"I am doing this review through my husbands account, so don't pay mind to the name! Sorry!I love all the Gillette Razors! I tried this Razor at my sisters house, and loved it as well. So, I went out and bought it at Sam's club. The first day was wonderful, and then the second was OK, and then by the third day I couldn't use it! So, i have to replace the heads every three days? I don't think so! On that third day I had to use a lather soap, which I shouldn't have to use since the head has gel built into it! I really don't think it is worth the money."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,Do not waste your money on this product. The product just sucks! It does not work well and does not last long at all. The gel on the side of the razors wear out rather very quickly. I used it on my legs and it gave me razor burn instead of soothing my skin while I shave. Venus got the idea from Shick's Intuition Brand of womans razors; they have the same product and it is clearly better and more efficent.
3,They are purple :),"These take some getting used to. The gel bars tend to wobble a bit and therefore make the razor unstable. Because of that, the first few times that I used these, I ended up cutting my legs.They shave fine. I have sensitive skin and did not have any problem with a rash or razor burn. It is because they do not give a close shave. I am alright with that, though because I would rather have a less closer shave than a rash or razor burn any day.When the package is first opened, they stink. Fortunately, the intensity of the smell lessens over time."
1,Razor Burn,I just used this razor for the first time last week and got severe razor burn. My legs have had small scabs on them for a week now. You have to lather up your legs before using this razor.
1,venus breeze bad rash,"I tried this venus breeze thinking that aloe would be great. Well ended up with bad rash on my legs that itched like crazy.Today I spent the day with my daughter and granddaughters and told them about this rash and they too had purchased the same razor and ended up with bad rashes.Wow, I have never had a razor rash like this before so if you have sensitive skin please reconsider. You might save yourself some pain."
1,Convenient....but,"These blades are convenient, but don't shave closely and the lubrication bars split after a couple of shaves."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I'm sick of being deceived. On the product overview, it states that these are all songs done by the original artists. It's the *original artists* but with redone versions of these songs that are almost unrecognizable. Amazon should have the decency to list that fact on the product overview."
1,Bogus Bogus Bogus,"If these were the original recordings by the actual artists listed on the album, it would be a fairly decent collection of 70's AM hits. But...they are NOT - I strongly suspect these are done by some anonymous (and not very good) cover bands, and they aren't even good covers! Totally bogus. Huge disappointment. DON'T SPEND A DIME ON THIS!!! It's CRAP!"
4,not a bad read,D.E. Tarver is Known for his translation but this book is pretty good keeps you coming back. if you are looking for action its here but its more hands and feet bar room brawl then to do with a sword story line is nice a much better read then crummy love books however not up to par with great writers of action such as Robert Ludlum. his unique use of a person with a disability and one of great ugliness is unique and well done.
2,Doesn't cover well,"I'm not sure what product these other people are reviewing, but I can't get it to cover black ink in one coat. It's maddening. It'll cover pencil, but what use is that? It also takes an inordinate amount of time to dry (possibly because it's three coats deep by the time it actually covers the ink.)"
4,We want more!,"What a pleasant surprise! This book had my attention right from the start, and I'd find myself laughing out loud on occasion too! Jeni's Inbox was beautifully written and kept me intrigued right `til the end. I only wish now that I could learn what happened to the other characters in the book, did Aidan find love? How did her brother turn out? Did her co-worker live happily ever-after? So many more questions to be answered, I guess I'll just have to wait for the sequel - that's a hint for you, Mr. Evans! We want more!"
5,"Witty, informative, and elegant","No wonder this book was up for a 2004 Pulitzer Prize. First-time author Phillips has woven an intriguing tale with deft touches and unusual characters. I defy you to put it down, or think of sleep. Each chapter teases you into the next. There is real and solid information here about the machinations of the auction world. The author is obviously an expert observer, and watched the scandals that erupted in the l990's in their beginning stages. You will know who, and what, each character in an auction house does, and how their lives flow together and apart. Those who are in the art and auction world in New York love this book. Bravo. Very nearly a work of art, certainly a work of knowledge."
5,"Exciting, fabulous","As an interior designer, I watch the auction houses, and attend sales regularly. I have NEVER before had an explanation of what actually goes on that presents art, decorative art, and antiques buying to us in the fashion that the major auction houses manipulate it..Now I know, and every interior designer should.Must reading for every designer who scavenges, bids at the auction houses, and is sometimes dismayed and horrified by the price escalation. Bravo to the author for a lucid and intelligent explanation of what actually goes on."
4,Una recopilación de Blues indispensable,"Robert Cray es sin lugar a dudas un futuro clásico del Blues de nuestra era. Su mezcla de Blues, R 'n' Blues y Soul está en la línea de grandes del blues de los 60, y su forma de tocar la guitarra es característica a lo largo de toda su carrera. Si te gusta el Blues no puedes prescindir de este volumen que reune lo mejor de este bluesman. KLO"
3,Robert Cray - Definitive Collection,"This was ok, I have another one of his CD's which was better, Strong Persuader."
4,It stopped water,I used this to plug the drain on my hot tub. It just doesn't seal tight enough by itself. This fits fine and has a hex end so you can get a wrench on it. But it got 4 stars instead of 5 because it did not come with a gasket.
4,As Described,"Not very innovative, but it does the job. I guess I can update this review in a couple of years to see if it lasts that long!"
5,Daughter loves it!,"Our daughter loves JoJo on the Disney channel, so this was a no-brainer. She loves dancing with the video."
4,daughter loves it,My 2 year old daughter absolutely loves both this Jo Jo video and the take a bow one as well.
5,Yummy Doctors and a Happy Ending - Who Needs ER?,"This is the first Kate Hardy book I've read, and it won't be the last - I was up till the wee small hours reading His Emergency Fiancee. Just couldn't put it down. Kirsty, the heroine, is a warm, likeable woman, hero Ben is gorgeous, and the rest of the characters are well-developed and three-dimensional characters. The 'pretend fiancee' plot is an oldy but a goody, and Hardy carries it off convincingly. The emotional and sensual tension between Kirsty and Ben is gut-wrenching at times. Add to the mix some medical drama (non-medicals readers, don't let it put you off - there's not that much), office (ward) politics and a warm-hearted grandmother, and you've got a rich story that you just don't want to end. If you haven't read Harlequin Medicals or Kate Hardy, you don't know what you are missing."
3,this leaves streaks,"It cleans your computer screen, yes, that's great, but it will leave streaks. It's basically just like one of those clean wipes. I find that I need to wipe my screen again with another cloth after I used these pads. Argh. . .more work, but I guess there's nothing better out there."
3,NOT THAT GREAT,the wipes I got were over priced and the shipping was too. the quality was average at best
2,Wouldn't Purchase Again,Only the second Vol. contains actual redwork patterns you can trace or photocopy from. The first Vol. contains only tiny pictures that you would need to magnify 50 times just to be able to trace it and that's if the photocopy would even come out. I thought there would be many more patters included. The book covers show redwork for which there is no pattern inside. Wish I would have saved my money. The second vol. does contain many nice patterns though - just wish more of those would have been included.
4,American Redwork Quilts & Patterns,I found these books to be very informative and interesting. I would recommend them to anyone interested in Redwork Quilts.
5,One of Their Most Solid Albums,"There's a reason this album went #2 on the Oricon charts. With Stacked Rubbish, The GazettE exhibits a strong and steady growth and evolution from NIL. This is a very strong album and includes a surprisingly versitle range of styles from track to track. Almost every song is well written and solid. It is a must-have for GazettE fans. It's also a great place to start for new listeners."
3,"Great story, little predictable","I liked this book, although the story line is a bit too predictable. As a fictional novel. it doesn't hit the nerve and cutting edge to be a 5 star adventure story. The characters are a bit flat, and I couldn't connect to the heroes emotionally. Good read though for a rainy day."
3,Not as advertised!,"Just who is writing these reviews??? The story is decent at best but far from the exciting story these reviews would lead you to believe. It should be labelled ""Country folk survive winter"", definitely little to nothing about the world pandemic aside from the first few chapters and then it devolves into a story of a couple of groups living in the country surviving but is far from exciting, detailed or having much at all to deal with the pandemic. The story seems to skip in time again and again. That being said it's a decent story worthy of a read and a few stars but far from 5 star material and far from anything I haven't read before."
1,No Degas,"No Degas. Here's the premise - if the photographyis black and white, then it is ""art"". As a fineartist myself, I find this lifeless, dreary,indulgent work an embarrassment to the dance andthe dancers. Perhaps this was useful as a Havanavacation write off, otherwise it is a waste of time.The quality of the production and presentation areare wasted on the below average content. Do yourselfa favor, take your own trip to Havana, and dance.Beware the hype."
4,Tolerance,Tolerance is an awesome band that deserves more created than they are getting. I have seen these guy's in concert many times and there is so much energy. I love this album it is one of my all time favorites. I love this band!
2,Wasn't as good as I expected.,"I purchased this book for my husband after we lost our twin boys at birth. From reviews I thought it might be a good book for him to see what another father's viewpoint was after the loss of a baby, but unfortunately I didn't think it was as moving as I expected, especially after having just gone through a similar experience."
5,A must read for people with RA,"As a nurse, I enjoyed this book on two levels. First, for the indepth information it provides about TNF blockers as a class of drugs and then a chapter for each of the individual drugs Enbrel, Humira, and Remicade.Second, this book is very patient friendly. It's filled with lots of helpful charts, a decision matrix and a whole chapter of questions and answers on everything from what to do if you miss a dose to why these drugs need refrigeration. It even explains how patients without insurance or pharmacy benefits can get help obtaining these medications. The patient stories and quotes also make the book interesting.This book is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ for people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (and Psoriatic Arthtirits and Ankylosing Spondylitis), or anyone considering or now taking Enbrel, Humira, or Remicade.This book is perfect for physicians and nurses too!"
5,Excellent Book,This is an excellent book. I see Dr. Zashin for Sjogren's syndrome and he is an excellent Doctor. I found the book to be very knowledgeable.
3,It helped,"hen I needed some additional research I turned to this book. It helped me to form my own decision, thanks!"
3,Good reading..,I enjoyed this book. It was interesting to read about the day to day life of a Vietnam soldier and how they were subject to completing sometimes very dangerous duties.
5,Fast and Flawless,"I just went to London and Paris and took 923 hi-res pictures on my Canon XTi 10.1 mp Rebel and the card performed flawlessly. There wasn't even a pause when I shot continuous frames. Not only does this thing perform better than all the competition, but it's priced well below the others"
5,A must read for all who love America.,God's Final Warning To America is a thought provoking and emotionally rousing look at the spiritual condition of America. Mr. McTernan's perspective is God exists and is very active in the lives of men. He makes a strong case with a body of evidence showing that God is using national disasters to call attention to America's recent propensity for sinful destructive lifestyles. Throughout the book he makes connections between national disasters and events of national sin. His book is very well documented and logically laid out. A must read for all who love America.
5,This book has solid biblical foundation,"John McTernan has written an important book that explicitly documents how Americans' disobedience to the will of God inevitably results in divine retribution. The proof is in the news clippings! and in Gen. 12 and Matt. 25. By His mercy, the Lord is giving America one final chance to repent of its sins of tolerance for homosexuality and abortion and failure to stand with Israel. If these warnings are not heeded, judgment surely awaits. This book is a vital wake-up call to the body of Christ and to America at large. The Lord God is not pleased. Share this book with your friends who are on the fence."
1,Why do people believe this glop?,"A friend of mine loaned me this book. Thank God, (and, yes, there is one), I didn't expend money to buy it.As noted, the author is an evangelist. He has no familiarity with the principles of logic or physical science that I can discern.OF COURSE, there are going to be more weather-related disasters in America than was so in times past, FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE COUNTRY IS BECOMING MORE CROWDED. The tornado that chews up a subdivision today would have swirled the grass in an empty field just a few years ago, for example. Does this mean God hates us? Hardly, except to folks like McTiernan, perhaps.This sort of writing dumbs down America in my opinion, and I certainly could not possibly recommend to any intelligent reader."
3,not bad,"a good concept, although some rough material on the various rest levels would help the gun from sliding around, they are just too smooth."
5,"Very Enjoyable, Breezy, If Basic, Look At Sir Winston!","Having plowed through tons of books on WSC, I found this one among the brightest, breeziest, most entertaining of all! Not at all ""heavy"", or dense, it is a fine introduction, or a nice ""wrapping up"" for the WSC buff, like myself. It covers just about all the basics, mentioning his family , children (one who died at age 2), young school days,early life heroics, his controversies, like Dardanelles (but omits the Labor Riots and Norway fiascoes). Often , 2 sides of the stories are shown, like ""Was he an alcoholic?"", ""Was he a Good Family Man/Father/Hubbie?"" Even his public crying is described, and theres is even a question/answer section at the back! In the end, the author suggests that despite his huge flaws, inability to listen, etc., his awesome reputation is truly deserved! Tough to argue with that!"
1,"Amateurish effort: Boring, repetitive, uninspired","It is incredible that a major press would waste wood pulp on this pathetic book. Given the state of the American reading public, I suppose one may anticipate more ""books"" of this kind. If you wish to know about the historical debates that attach to Winston Churchill's public career and private life, consult Robert Blake and William Louis, eds., CHURCHILL (W.W. Norton, 1993). The book contains more than two dozen essays that assess Churchill as politician, statesman, journalist, and historian. If you want an eminently readable, sympathetic, and wise introduction to his life, read Geoffrey Best, CHURCHILL: A STUDY IN GREATNESS (Hambledon, 2001; Oxford has just published a paperback edition)."
2,A shallow faux biography,"Tucked into the Select Bibliography on p. 284 is a telling detail, a confession by the author that ""Forty Ways to Look at Winston Churchill rests on the work of more comprehensive biographers."" A more honest book would have included this key piece of information up front. The author is neither a biographer nor a Churchill scholar, but someone who combines her reading of other people's work with the not-very-earth-shattering (and by the end of the book tiresome) idea that a life can be seen from a variety of perspectives, and Churchill was a complex and sometimes contradictory figure. Rubin comes across as a dilettante (complete with a self-promoting website, duly noted on the dust jacket). All in all, an irritating book."
1,Execrable Editing,"This already short book should be about 50 pages shorter yet. It is laced with repeated quotes, phrases, and facts. The first time you read that Churchill carried a lance in one of history's last cavalry charges, it's fascinating. The second time, it's a surprise to see the statement repeated almost verbatim. The third time, it's an insult.Again and again (and again), this pattern is repeated. On one page, the same clause from a Churchill quote appears three times. Enough already. It's bad enough that the writer made this mistake, but it's unforgivable for the editor to let it pass for publication in this shape. By paring 50 pages off the manuscript, it would be just what it claims to be -- not a bad short rehash of the existing Churchill biographies.Save your money. Get another Churchill biography."
4,Thought provoking and quick,"40 Ways to Look at Winston Churchill will be of interest to two groups of readers- those who know something about the man, but who haven't the time or interest to read a full biography, and those interested in Rubin's approach- presenting brief chapters devoted to one aspect of the subject's life. Especially interesting are the contradictory chapters- such as ""Churchill had a drinking problem"", paired with ""Churchill didn't have a drinking problem."" With the mega-biography still in fashion, this is a breath of fresh air."
4,Makes you want to read more about Churchill,"A good summary of Churchill's life, that gets better as you go along. A bit disjointed, but that's not a problem if you read it before bedtime, like I did."
5,Brilliant snapshots that illumine the greatest man of his generation,"It is the lot of great men and women to be entombed in biographies the size of the Lenin Mausoleum. And when sub-biographers turn their hand to popularizations one gets, well, sub-biography; the standard judgments taken from the big biographies but in too brief a compass to give the reader much sense of the subject of the biography beyond the biographer's predilections. One way out is through a cutaway like John Lukacs' superb Five Days in London. Another is through the lens of a skilled and constantly shifting pararazza like Gretchen Rubin, who excels in delivering a biographical portrait that is digestible for those with less than Proustian appetites for bulk, but is very far from a ""popular"" biography.Someone has distinguished between the simplicity that lies this side of complexity, and the simplicity on the far side. I'm in no doubt where Forty Ways to look at Winston Churchill is to be found.Nigel Cameron"
4,a fresh way to look at Churchill if you already know something about him,"This book is a good way to get a fresh look (forty of them) at Churchill, but not a good way to approach him if you are starting from scratch. It's not a conventional biography - read at least an encyclopedia article first. The author captures different angles of his life in each chapter, using a variety of techniques. I found it an engaging read and recommend it to anyone who wants to think about Churchill or sort the facts in one's head. I won't spoil what I thought was the most interesting way to look at Churchill suggested by Rubin..."
3,Totally unresearched but reallly good pictures.,"Nick Wise obviously did no research for this book. He got the wrong year of her birthdate, and he spelled one of her last names wrong. It was totally lame. The only reason it gets any stars is because the pictures are beautiful and it's Courtney at her best."
4,tons of cool pictures!,"as in terms of the information... well... if you already know alot about courtney, you ll most likely find nothing new. there are alot of great quotes though. the pictures, on the other hand, are fabulous. and are pretty rare too. i would seriously consider picking up this book if you like to collect pics of courtney and hole. if u just wanna good read, i d reconsider and go buy courtney love queen of noise by melissa rossi. another good simmilar book is look through this by susan wilson, its even bigger and has even more fabulous rare pics of ms love and hole..... if u love your courtney pics get the book....."
2,Photo software,"Not what I expected, perfect condition not the sellers fault. Couldn't do as much as the web site led me to believe. Don't use it. Waist of money."
4,slip sliding away,"Save no ones sanity, master monologist Spalding Gray is at it again. This time delivering the most neurotic and insightful commentary on the subject of the mid-life crisis. Finding the perfect balance between career and personal life is metaphoricly shown to us through the eyes of a man learning to ski for the first time. Gray is a maestro of the ""first person"" leading the reader up and down the rocky sloaps of the novel. At the end of the perfect run, Gray only slips in his sementality. Finding the perfect balance has only made his bitting humor about the subject a bit soggy."
5,A masterful portrayal of the triumph of the human spirit.,"I haven't read the book version of Spalding Grey's latest monologue, however, I did have the wonderful opportunity to see him perform it live. I was, naturally, overwhelmed. Mr. Gray takes the audience on a journey from the mountains of Colorado to the innermost reaches of his soul. Certainly his most personal monologue yet (beat that), ""It's a Slippery Slope"" explores facets of Spalding Gray's personality never before reached. A definite winner!"
4,Get ready to dance around a cauldron and drop a frog into a pot,"In what must have been, for lack of a better term, a turbulent time for Gray the metaphor of skiing became striking and profound. This monologue, which isn't as funny as Gray's Anatomy for example, is initially a bit directionless. Perhaps intentionally though, as the last half or so is quite compelling, even frightening, in it's emotional nakedness and the clarity with which he expresses the tumult of those days.So I can't respond to this in the same manner as Gray's Anatomy, which proved reverential and somewhat calming. It's a Slippery Slope is deeper, uneasy, fraught in the ways of mania and adulthood, and heart-rendering too.Coming to Gray post-mordem is saddening, as his writing is exceptional and he took many untold stories..."
4,"Bought this for school, and kept it",This book is very light-weight and informational. It was interesting and easy to read because of its small size. Also the paperback makes it easy to carry in backpack. Great product. Especially for those who want to go beyond what's required for learning and pursuing more in-depth theories and principals in Economics.
5,Actually quite interesting,"Very applicable, and surprisingly good. One of my favorite econ classes. It is expensive, but I guess it's par for the course for academic books."
5,Gazette Stacked Rubbish,"I absolutely love this CD. Gazette is fast becoming my favorite Japanese artist, and this CD is amazing! I would highly recommend it to anyone."
1,So dissapointed,This prodoct came not only used (shown as new) from Plex Supply but did noteven work!Unreal - how can Amazon even have this vendor on their site.Makes me leary of buying anything on Amazon
4,What Religious Science Teaches,Aside from the texbook feel of the work it still is very good and clear.
5,Best Batista,This Batista has an awesome headscan. I love the way theat they did this one. I will definitely be buying this figure.
5,Awesome Figure,"I must say, I have another Batista figure, but this one is better. It has his updated attire, it's pretty durable, and the new World Title is huge."
1,Buyer beware!!,"Picked up a Werner S2208 attic ladder. The design was ""NEAT""... gas struts, no springs, sturdy STEEL construction. HOWEVER... after installation (4 hours) the hanging arms jammed against the strut and broke the strut retaining clip. The other arm jammed against the door and gouged a chunk of wood out of the door. The manufacturer tried to send me new pieces, re-designed, to repair the door. NOT! I took it back! Re think your purchase selection on this model!"
1,This thing is DANGEROUS !!!,"It would not surprise me to find out that Werner had been sued over this awful contraption. After 3 months of use (I weigh 175 lbs) the self folding stair hardware (which was iffy even when brand new) became so badly misaligned, that I had to take a hacksaw to it. After using the ladder for a while, the leg lock joints began to loosen, so each time I used it, I was careful to exam it. And then the inevitable happened. The legs failed on one side (the crappy cast aluminum pivot snapped in half) leaving me dangling form the top step. Luckily, I had a table to step off onto to avoid falling. I am thinking of cutting the thing into pieces and sending to Werner! DO NOT BUY THIS LADDER !!! I gave one start rating only because you can't leave the field empty"
1,Dangerous ladder,I had this ladder installed in my new home 4 years ago. It worked fine until today. I was climbing down the ladder and the lowest ladder section just snapped off which left me dangling in mid hair. I carefully reached my leg over to a half wall nearby and got off the ladder. The aluminum hinge on both sides just snapped off. This could have turned out much worse if I was standing on the lower section when this happened. I weigh only 190 lbs and the ladder is rated at 300 lbs. Don't trust this ladder.
2,Think Twice,"I bought this ladder approximately 2 years ago at Lowes and it really worked great until today. I began taking down the Chrismas deocrations and fortumately went up to turn the light on without a load and when coming down the lst section (closest to the floor) of the ladder broke!! I am 200# and I wasn't carrying anything. Werner decided on cutting costs and used pot metal at the section joints and that is what gave. Thankfully I wasn't hurt, but please think about looking at other ladders for your own safety.Finally, I looked to see if I could possibly buy replacement parts to fix it, but the entire ladder is fastened with non-removable pins and no replacement parts are offered. I will now have to buy a whole new ladder system!!I will probably go with the A2510 this time...keeping my fingers crossed!!"
2,Would be great if the material used was better,Had the this attic ladder for several years before one of the bottom hinges broke. Sound like several people have had it break as well. Hope that the replacement they are shipping me takes care of the issue. Because it worries me that they are sending me something to fix it no questions asked and that it was pulled from their website.Makes me evaluate any design I use in the future. Because all it takes is someone trying to save a few pennies using a cheaper material than what was really needed. The wrong design could fail with tragic results.
1,Werner attic ladder - faulty hinges - beware!,"I have the Werner s2210, and like so many others have experienced, lower hinge broke after approx. 5 yrs. If you search under ""werner s2210"" you will find many people that experienced the failure. Personally, I would look at another vendor. (I only weigh 140 lbs.)"
1,Werner Products poor quality,I've used my Werner attic ladder 12 times. I'm under the weight limit for the product. The hinge shattered (i.e. very poor metal). Werner's response.. buy a new ladder.... which mean's I need to shell out another $200 for someone to install the ladder (overhead installation is very difficult). Recommend you buy anything other than werner.
3,Werner 10ft Steel Attic Access Ladder,"Ladder works as advertised, however, for me, it was not a 1-person installation as I required assistance when lifting the ladder onto the frame (The ladder unit is approximately 65 lbs). Also use caution when tightening the nuts fastening the upper link supports to the stand-off plate. I sheared off one of the stand-off plate bolts. As mentioned earlier, the ladder is heavy and as such can be difficult to maneuver when opening."
5,RARE BASSOONISTS!! Sol Schoenbach AND Milan Turkovic!!,"It's hard to find any Sol Schoenbach recordings anymore. All of the ensembles are great!! I highly recommend this cd to any wind player. Many highly excellent musicians, all on one cd. It is a very relaxing cd, also."
1,Mozart deserves better treatment,"I was really disappointed by this lousy performance of the Gran Partita. Sure they get all the notes, but there's no feeling of magic. The Academy of St. Martin in the Fields gives this composition a much better treatment. I also plan to check out the famous Mackerras version in the future. As far as the two Divertimentos for winds, they are minor works, but the recordings of them are better quality. The Fantasia is not for winds and, pardon the expression, a wind arrangement takes the ""wind"" out of it. Try a recording of it on organ or piano or the mechanical organ it was meant for. The same goes for the last piece on this album."
4,Honestly...,"I found the first selection here to be simply gorgeous. Mozart's music can be simply sublime sometimes. To me, the notes in the score are magical in and of themselves. Having said that, I have not experienced the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields recording of this; so I cannot judge this recording against that one. However, I have no regrets over saving a few dollars and being enraptured by the good music-making done on this disc."

2,No Atomic Clock,"Delivery was fine, set up easy, but could not get atomic clock setting to work. Also remote temperature was useless beyond 15 feet. Returned as not as advertised. My previous product lasted 10 years, same model I think , but quality has faded. RLW"
3,Hang or stick,"Good station but should have an option to either hang,or use a magnet it is always in the way"
2,Oregon Wireless Weather Station,This product worked for 2 weeks and has now stopped working. It appears to be the sending unit and I am returning it for a replacement from Amazon. Perhaps the new one will work OK.
3,Acceptable but not great,"I like the indoor/outdoor readings this device provides. What I don't like and find very confusing is that every time I look at the device in the evening, it is predicting rain. I live in Phoenix, AZ... we don't get rain every month, let alone every day. I don't know what makes it think there will be rain, but I am disappointed that it behaves like this. Perhaps it behaves better in less extreme climates.It was a bit confusing to setup the first time, but it really only took about 20 minutes to get the outdoor sensor communicating reliably with the base station.I don't really regret the purchase at this point, but I recommend looking for better options."
2,Temp Monitor,We have been unable to set the time on this product. We have taken the batteries out and repeated set up steps several times. The time will not set by Atomic Clock nor will it keep manual time set. It also shows rain when the humidity is high but it is not actually raining. The only thing accurate appears to be the temperature! I plan to contact mfg of my concerns and perhaps they can assist...
4,Wireless Weather Station & Atomic Clock review,Overall we have been very pleased with this weather station. The only thing that is confusing is that the weather station will indicate rain when there is no rain in sight. Other than that it has been very accurate so far.
4,Very pleased,"I have had a number of weather stations and this is the best of the lot. So far, it has functioned as I had hoped. While I have not had it through a full cycle of seasons, it appears to be accurate in its current readings and forecasts. I am comfortable in recomending it."
5,very satisfied,"unlike several other weather stations I ordered, this one picked up the signal from Colorado on the first night and has worked fine ever since,theotnhers never would pick up the signal no matter where I put the unit, I think because I lve in south Florida and the unit must have a strong receiver as this one does"
4,What's the temp?,We have our Weather Station in the kitchen. It's the first thing we look at every day. Temp is true to the outside as well as the temp inside. The only thing is that it will show sunny with its pouring rain. But that's OK with us because it does every thing else.
3,So-so,I still haven't been able to figure out how to change the time zone; the directions appear to be a poor translation into English from some other language.
3,Disappointed,I wanted to know the temperature outside so I would know how to dress to go running. Well the sensor has to be so close to the main unit in order to pick up a signal that you have to put it in the windowsill right outside the main unit. Which does not give a very accurate reading of what the temperature is outside but instead what the temperature is next to your window which is getting some warmth from inside the house.
2,"well...maybe not our weather, but it must be someone's...","Smaller than I had orginally hoped, but easy to read. The biggest problem is that the unit seems to be confused as to what the weather actually is. It will show rain falling on a very sunny day, and then a bright sun on an overcast day!! Our outdoor thermostat also seems to be difficult, almost finicky. It doesn't often register, although we have checked where it is located and do have a signal..Overall, a VERY disappointing present for my weather enthusiast husband."
1,Doesn't Work,"I followed the instructions - more complicated than should be necessary - meticulously and used fresh batteries, but the unit simply didn't work. I would give this item zero stars if such an option were available. The technology for these weather stations isn't so complicated that it excuses out-of-the-box malfunctions of this sort."
2,Disappointment,"I selected this item after a search for one made in USA. Oregon Scientific came up so I purchased it. After unwrappping it I saw that it was made in China, just what I did not want. I have used it and parts do not work, such as memory of high and low readings. I should have rewrapped it and returned to sender."
4,Works great except for one thing,"We got one of these to monitor the temperature and humidity in our basement, to make sure our wine isn't suffering. It works fine, except for one thing: due to an apparent firmware bug, we're unable to set thresholds for high and low temperature and humidity alarms. Despite what the manual says, your only options for high/low temperature/humidity alarms are ""disabled"" or a single setting... you don't get to choose your own alarm thresholds.It's still usable, but we have to check the maximum/minimum temperatures and humidity by eye, since we can't rely on the alarms to notify us if either goes out of bounds."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the performance of the weather station. I bought it to be able to monitor the temperature in an office building in a couple of different locations. First, the temperature indicator is 2 degress off. Also, I have found that the additional sensor that I bought does not work with my device. Lastly the weather indicator is not very accurate -- it frequently predicts rain which most of the time doesn't happn -- even a broken clock is right 2 times per day. Was hoping for a little more accuracy."
5,"Very handy, reliable","We have 2 of these and I don't know how many times a day we look at it. We live in the midwest and evidently are fascinated with the temp & humidity in the summer.(We also have one in AZ) The remote is on the front porch and other than replacing the batteries very occasionally we never have to touch it. With the moon phase, the date & time as well as the temp & humidity this is a forecast at a glance and we wouldn't be without it. You can have up to 3 remotes which would be handy in the garage, shed, upstairs, etc. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to anyone."
5,Basic weather station,"This is a replacement for a very old OS station. The previous expired when a battery leaked, I was very disappointed because the long and faithful service had come to an end. I searched all the manufacturers for a replacement, read the reviews and ultimately decided on this unit, mostly because of the previous experience with OS and this one was the closest match to the failed unit. The BAR388HGA displays humidity and atmospheric pressure. The failed unit did not have that capability. I've had the BAR388HGA for about 2 months and I'm very happy with it so far. If it lasts 10 years I'll consider it money well spent."
4,Wonderful Wireless Weather Station,"We bought two of these. We were very impressed how easy the set up was.Since installing the weather station - we have enjoyed the accuracy of the weather station both inside and outside temperatures.One feature of this weather station is a ice alert. Up here in north we do get freezing rain ice, and snow. This station has been right on thebutton with those predictions.I would highly recommend the purchase."
3,Good but,"Really miss the feature to light up the display. When I wake up I would like to tap on the backlight to see the temp.It does work as it is suppose to, and was very easy to set up."
4,Great looking and functioning,"Great product, I would buy it again. Nice to have the atomic clock feature and always having the temperature right at your finger tips. Only thing I find is it tends to say it is raining outside when it is not, looks like a flaw with the design as a friend has the same one and ours both say rain at the same time. Though not anything I worry about."
4,Great Weeather Station,This weather station performs very well. It has great basic functions. Setup was essentially plug n play. Even the remote functions worked right out of the box. The only drawback is the lack of a backlight. You cannot read the display in low light.
5,Informative and fun!,"We purchased this item for our new home and are delighted with it! It's a perfect size, easy to read and has all the necessary features to help you decide if the weather outside is frightful or fine. You can even set your clocks and watches to the accurate data of the Wireless Weather Station's Atomic Clock. Makes a great gift for anyone!"
4,Very Good,"Overall, very good. A little fussy when setting up, it took several ""resets"" to get the remote sensor to reliably communicate with the main unit, but once it was all set up, and stabilized, I'm very happy with the performance. One Caveat, though. In cold climates, you must buy (expensive) lithium batteries for the remote sensor."
5,Great Unit,"Been using the BAR388HGA-BK for about a month, now. Appears to be very accurate for both temp and humidity. Really helps in calibrating our whole house humidifier (who's hygrometer is way off). Automatic atomic clock is cool, too. Highly recommend."
5,Great Weather Station,For the price you get the same as other units selling for double or triple the price. The most important feature for me was exterior temp and humidity plus the unobtrusive design of the unit. All functions are easy to read on the display. Could not be happier with this purchase!
1,Did not work.,"I could not get the base unit to receive information from the remote transmitter. The transmitter would work if set immediately adjacent to the unit, but one wall in the way and there would be no reception. Also, I thought that this unit would mount to the wall, but due to the design it is not possible."
2,confused,"I bought this weather station along with two remote sensors. After about two days I was skeptical about the inside humidity (reading 4%). To test the accuracy, I placed the remote sensors side-by-side with this unit. The temp seems to all be in sync, but I get different humidity readings on all three...this morning was 4% 27% and 31%. I have no idea which one is correct. I'm going to return this product."
5,Nice Weather Station!,"We had a different brand that starts with an ""L"" for several years. It seem to have a mind of its own when you changed batteries trying to select the right time zone, etc. AND it wasn't always easy to read. The old unit stoped synch with the remote sensor so it went into the trash and we optioned for this unit. IT works right out of the box. We have it on a kitchen window and the LCD is very easy to see exactly whats going on. I've only had this running for a few days but like it already. It does support up to 3 zones so we could order 2 more sensors and monitor temps upstairs and down if we felt like it"
2,Two negative issues,"The unit works as advertised.However the 3 screws on the sending unit are so small that I could not find a screwdriver small enough to work on them.Two of them are deeply recessed also. There must be a better way.Also the heavy hard plastic wrapping required metal shears to defeat. Why this packaging for something that is not bought in a store?I would give this 5 stars, but subtract 3 because of the above problems."
1,Definitely a Lemon,One star is too high for this item. Out of the box the atomic clock did not work correctly and after an on line chat with Oregon Scientific to try to fix it they offered to replace it. However three days after receiving the item the remote sensor failed and new batteries and the prescribed reset did not bring it to life. This is an inferior product and a great disappointment. It looks nice and if it worked it would be great - but it doesn't. Look elsewhere!
1,Disappointed,"I have a La Crosse Tech WS-8035U-IT unit upstairs (more bells and whistles, more $$) and wanted another unit to see the outdoor temperature downstairs. I purchased the Oregon Scientific BAR608HGA as it was less money only to find the thing has never gotten the outdoor temperature right! Off by 3-20+ degrees - and unfortunately not consistently so I could merely make a mental arithmetic adjustment. The remote unit appears to be the issue as the indoor temperature has been correct. After a couple of weeks of trials, different weathers, different batteries, unit resets, both the indoor and remote units have had their batteries removed and are resting in the waste bin waiting for collection day. Perhaps the station got away without QA testing."
1,a bad product,"I had before for years an oregon weather station ( very nice product)I decide to buy a new one ( bad decision)it is impossible to find a good point1)IT IS NOT INFORMED THAT F/C IS AN OPTION ONLY FOR THE BASE AND NOT FOR THE REMOTEI need to use Celcius in my country .Oregon hide this information2)THE ICONS for moon phase are very, very small3)all trend information do not work!!!4)I have 3 others stations and temperature are very similar (diference under 1Cbut this station have more than 3 C diference !!!4)the clock dont have 24hs mode ( is a minor isssue)I am out USA and send back to Amazon will so expensive to have refund , so the only alternative I have is to write this review to alert: do not buy this productI lose 46U$!!!"
5,Great product,This is a great TV. The picture clarity is really good and the numerous features of this TV makes it a real good bargain at this price. The surround sound gives an extra edge to the experience of watching a movie or any other program. On the whole a great product and a decent price.
4,Wodehouse Rocks!,"Love anything by Wodehouse! And all of the ""Jeeves"" books are humorous. Don't know though why Jeeves remains with Bertie when he simply knows everything!"
3,It's a bit outdated,Prompted to read this book after seeing one of the old black and white movies. Very light reading. After a while the story line becomes predictable. Some good humor.
4,A fun read,"This series of short stories are easy to read and fun to follow. An intelligent writer, Wodehouse's colloquial style involves the reader in the zany antics of Bertie Wooster and his man Jeeves--everyone's idea of the perfect butler. My only objection to giving the fifth star was the inclusion of the stories involving Reggie, which seemed out of place among the Jeeves stories."
4,Was very entertaining to read...wanted to keep finding out what came next.,Great small stories bundled together...u start rooting for My Man Jeeves! Hoping he could save the day again and again
4,what can I say? I love Jeeves!,"Jeeves is the latter day fairy god father. Who wouldn't want such an unflappable resource with answers to all questions at one's beck and call? Even when it looks as if Jeeves might be wrong, he has all in hand, it all turns out well. This is a restful collection of Wodehouse's short stories. Wodehouse was an adept storyteller, long or short from, and while this is not a collection of his very best shorts, it's quite a good sampling."
4,Jeeves is always good.,"Short Jeeves and Pepper (prototype of Wooster) stories. Interesting cause theyre early stories, otherwise not the best Wodehouse, but still awesome."
4,A bed book for reading in the bed.,"I love Jeeves stories and these are some of the first. But not all are about Jeeves and Wooster, thou they would show up in later books changed to be Jeeves and Wooster stories.A bed book, as I pointed out, is meant to be used while in bed. It is designed so you can read it while on your side. I like to read books while laying on my front in bed, so it is nice to have. I had to take a star away for the fact that not ALL stories were of the J & W type."
3,Don't start here,"Mesnenor's review and Wikipedia do a good job of covering the facts, so I'll just add a subjective judgement: If you're new to Jeeves or Wodehouse, don't be tempted by the chronology and the availability of a Project Gutenberg edition: This is the wrong place to start on Jeeves, and Reggie Pepper is only for _after_ you've read all of Wodehouse's vintage works. The Reggie Pepper stories are from before his mature period (which starts with _Something Fresh_ in 1915), and these early Jeeves stories also read like juvenilia. He rewrote them for _Carry On, Jeeves_ a decade later, after he'd written _The Inimitable Jeeves_; start with those two, in the order named."
4,What ho! What entertainment!,"This is a wonderfully funny audio version of the famous characters created by P. G. Wodehouse. Martin Jarvis has a very good grasp of all the characters and gives each its proper inflexion. If you've never read any of the stories of Wodehouse, this is a great place to start. There are a lot of narrated versions of Wodehouse on the market, and you will be quite happy with this one, though I think the version recorded by Charlton Griffin is so far my favorite. (His voice for Bertie is somehow exactly right.) But I quibble. Jarvis is charming and has just the proper touch of the blasé Englishman. The selection of bubbly stories is quite good."
3,"Stories are good, repetitive","This is a good set of Jeeves stories, but since they all follow the same format it's not as good to read in one sitting as some of the others. It's overall an enjoyable collection."
2,It got a little boring,"The writing is excellent and stories try to be clever, but the eliteism of the main character gets a little tiresome after while."
5,My Man Jeeves,Typical Wodehouse. Very quirky characters. Fun. Some stories are about characters other than Bertie Wooster and Jeeves. All are amusing.
3,no strictly Jeeves,"Some stories were not Jeeves and Wooster, which was a disappointment also I felt some stories were repeats from other Wodehouse books"
4,Jeeves is wonderful,But you can't help seeing the PBS series in your mind as you read it. But that made it more enjoyable for me.
5,Delightful!,Bertie and Jeeves - and the rest of P.G. Wodehouse's delightful characters - take you back to a more innocent time. Silly and sweet.
3,Pretty dated....,"While I enjoy period pieces and British humor, the vignettes are somewhat repetitious, and the writing is too full of cliches. Very dated reading."
4,My Man Jeeves,Enjoyable book. I used to watch the Jeeves movies. I find the book is following alone those lines with the Jeeves character.
2,Disappointed,"Because of good reviews and seeing this author on so many must-read lists, I went into this title with high hopes. I don't see what all the hoopla is about-very ordinary writing and ho-hum characters."
3,My Man Jeeves,"Not all of the books in this multi-booked edition/collection are related to Jeeves and Wooster. There are strange ""squares with four numbers"" between words."
3,Jeeves isn't in Half of the Stories,"This review is for the free Kindle version of My Man Jeeves.The characters are quite fun and the author had a sneaky sense of humor. I found myself rereading sentences and chuckling. I can see why they made this into a TV show.Each section or chapter is a short story. Unfortunately the plot formula of: problem, scheme, failure of original scheme, and final reveal of a hidden agenda, was repeated in each one. It got old and I ended up skimming.Also - Jeeves doesn't appear in half of the stories. Odd.I enjoyed it, but will not read on since I assume it will be more of the same."
2,Uncomfortable,"Having bought ""Carry On Jeeves!"" and ""My Man Jeeves"" at the same time from Amazon, I quickly discovered that ""My Man Jeeves"" contained some of the same short stories at the other book. Quite unexpected. MMJ is manually awkward; it is about 8.5 x 11 inches in size. The set up of the text is amateurish: there are spaces between lines that should not be there. Don't buy this one. Go get ""Carry On, Jeeves!"" instead. Much, much better, quite enjoyable. -- BBH"
4,A cure for insomnia,"I listen to audio books all night - re-cuing to where I left off every time I wake up. Jeeves is a very light, relaxing, entertaining listen - especially when narrated by Jarvis. I DO laugh out loud occasionally - even on the 2nd or 5th listen - and even at 3am, but the lightness of the stories and the humor are surpassed (to my taste) only by John Mortimer's Rumpole series read by Leo McKern.Like ""Tootsie"" the movie, you won't come away from this with a different outlook on life, but it's good escape and, for me, chases away the worries that night in the George Bush era bring."
1,Bad Edition Of Great Content,"A rather rummy edition, from an anonymous publisher, what? Seems a bit unscrup to me.Wodehouse is fantastic and everyone should read him. However, DO NOT spend money on this bizarre edition which lists no publishing house anywhere in it's oversize pages. This strange collection comes in magazine size, not paperback size for no reason that I could see except that it's a cheap way to print. There are no credits, citations or anything which must mean that Wodehouse has gone into Public Domain so now anyone can make a buck off his great work. I would have returned this had I not purchased it for a Christmas gift and had no time in which to do so. Why there is no currently available collection of all the Jeeves stories is huge mystery to me - if only Jeeves could turn his magnificent bean to solving it."
4,First rate research but little criticism,"Straightforward journalistic over view of Murdoch's career while also giving useful insight into the print and media worlds of Australia and the UK in the 50s to 80s.However, little comment ventured as to Murdoch's underlying motivations or his relationships with family or friends.Stops in early 1990s, so an update or second edition would be good.Author seems a bit infatuated with his subject and reserves his criticism for Murdoch's competitors and critics like Maxwell and Harold Evans."
2,Baroque Hits Missed,"I was very disappointed with this CD because most all of the pieces are strange arrangements of the pieces and not the ""normal"" renditions. I say ""normal"" because most of these pieces are known by versions played on modern instruments. The disk should have been labeled ""arrangements"" and the Amazon description should have included that information. Add to this annoyance the fact that the arrangements themselves were bizarre. I was certainly not expecting many of these chestnuts to be adapted to a brass ensemble. So don't get this if you want a compilation of Baroque chestnuts played as we normally hear them."
1,Pachebel in Taco Bell,"You know what would be funnier than Pachabel in the woods, or Pachabel with whale noises, or Pachabel with the sounds of the rainforest in a snowstorm on a July day with a couple camels giving birth? Pachabel in Taco Bell. I would buy that CD.I'd just like to point out the fact that Pachebel is far and away the worst, most overrated, most boring classical piece ever written. And if it wasn't before, it has been played so much, on so many occasions, with so many stupid accompaniments (yes, this includes with whale noises) that it is now. You want a beautiful piece? I give you Barbar's Adagio for Strings. I give you Meditation from Thais. I'll even give you sentimental, sappy garbage like Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet. Just please, for the sake of good taste everywhere, put down that Pachebel CD."
1,"Sratched, cheap and flimsy",Stay away from this lamp! It is cheaply made and has scratches all over the front of it. Definately not worth $27.00. Seems like something that you could get for $3.99 on a clearance table at a dicount store.
3,Elegant looking lamp,"The lamp is very elegant looking and very bright for its size...which I like. The relatively small size makes it an excellent bed side lamp.The only problem I have with it is location of the on/off switch, I have never being able to turn on/off without having to look into the lamp shade to find the switch."
3,Lamp REview,"Make sure you know exactly how big this lamp is, its much smaller than I thought it would be. It is a very nice design and illuminates the area you want well. There is only one problem with the lamp, the base that the light bulb screws into is very loose, enough so that whenever you turn it on or off it makes quite a bit of noise. I think this is unacceptable."
1,Returned it,"I guess the lamp was fine, if you wanted it to go in like a play house. It was cute, but it was too small to be practical in any normal sized space."
4,Perfect For The Bedroom,"I love these lamps. I had a difficult time finding the right lamps for my bedroom--these fit the bill; not too big, not too small. Great craftsmanship."
2,wobbly!,These lamps are OK...barely. skip these. Super wobbly and built poorly. It's hard to reach the on/ off switch under the shade without knocking the shade off.
1,"""Truly Great Album?"" I think not.","I would say, ""if you're a fan of Blo-Dry-Country music which is derivative of the worst of the Eagles or latter-day Poco, then this is the CD for you."" But why waste your money on this absurdly over-priced item when you can tune in to the country station and hear 100 songs, equally devoid of inspiration and originality?If you're looking for some lost treasures from Rusty Young, wake up! There aren't any."
2,crinoline,The crinoline is pictured as being long enough to come to knees of 7-8 yr old child. It is much shorter that shown. They must have had it at hips to be this long. I didn't see anything about no return on markdown items so now am stuck with 2 of these
5,These guys can play!,"This is New Grass at its best. The playing is fast and clean. But the Waybacks do not sacrifice creativity for speed. Some of their tunes catch such a great groove that I find it hard to keep still which can be a problem when I'm driving. They start well grounded in bluegrass and then take you on a journey from there to swing, Reverend Gary Davis' blues, Ireland, psychedelica and beyond. All this is done with a playfulness that leaves me smiling every time I listen."
5,WOW! Way Live!,"Hubby and I waited with baited breath for this CD and we were amazed. We shouldn't have been so surprised. Their prior CDs were fantastic and they are unbelievable live. This record captures everything that the Waybacks are live -- lively, serious, irreverant, funny, phenomenal musicians. As a group, they are masters of their craft. Every track shows what the Wabes are good at, their brand of music at its best. They call it acoustical mayhem. I call it amazing. Buy this CD. You won't be disappointed."
1,"BBE ""Crusher"" High Gain Distortion Pedal","Unlike the excellent BBE ""Benchpress"" vintage Compressor, ""Green Screamer"" Overdrive, and ""Two Timer"" dual setting Analogue Delay, the BBE ""Crusher"" High Gain Distortion Pedal with 3-Band EQ adds a lot of unwanted noise to your effects loop and has some strange sound anomalies that appear at the end of sustained guitar cords. After a two minute demo, I determined that this stomp box was not for me and I scheduled a return. This pedal was quite a disappointment in comparison to BBE's other great products, and in what appeared to be a very cool EQ design."
1,huge pills,"These pills are absolutely huge. I heard that they are third party tested, but they are very large in size."
5,A MUST SEE!!!,"My sister and brother-in-law our in this documentary! He was wounded in Iraq and is fortunate enough to share his story. I firmly believe that every American Citizen should watch this documentary. It is very graphic, but it is REAL. No made up bull! Two thumbs up on this one!"
4,Nice puzzle!,It's a nice puzzle but the only thing that bothered me was that the pieces fit together really loosely. All that blue sky was a bit challenging. Overall it's a nice puzzle.
2,Poor moulding.,"I bought this because of all the people that recommended it for the stampede. Unfortunately, they are so poorly moulded that with only half throttle the truck shakes violently and only gets worse as speed increases. Fitting the stock traxxas 4x4 stampede wheels turned out much better with my widebody modded Pede."
5,Works like a charm,"I use head phone to listen to music or while playing the keyboard and couldn't hear the phone ring. Now, no such problem. The light is bright enough that I can see it out of the corner of my eye. Easy to connect, too."
2,Strong in some spots but a mostly medicore follow up to II,"Evolution was one of the most hyped albums back in 1997 my sophomore year of high school. Naturally I rushed out to get the album and on my first listen I found the album to be weak, especially the fast tracks. Seven years later I re-bought the album and gave it another listen; as an adult I found the album to be stronger than I thought. Boyz II Men like Jodeci before them have always been the strongest with ballads and this is apparent on the singles Doin Just Fine,Never,4 Seasons Of Loneliness. Shawn's writing skills were apparent on the song Doin Just Fine which is one of the strongest songs on the album, however there's is a lot of weak material on the album. Songs such as Girl In The Life Magazine, Baby C'mon and To The Limit all seem forced and aren't song with that much heart. In my opinion truly evolved on their EXCELLENT fourth disc Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya."
2,"Slow, and Boring","I bought this CD 'cause people told me there was great music. I like slow music, but it's slow in almost every song. I think these boys need to come up with some more interesting R&b music. I know they can do better!!! Cause there CD before this one is awsome!! So go out there Boyz and do something!!!"
3,good,"I must say that the Boyz are still the best R&B quartet out there. Evolution shows that. Though there may not be as many radio friendly songs on the album as ""2,"" there are still some great songs. Doin' Just Fine, 4 Seasons, Can't Let her go, and Song for Mama are the stand out cuts. I didn' enjoy it quite as much as 2, but it is still a better album than most R&B out there."
3,Best Boys II Men Album so far,"Features several very strong songs (doin' just fine, 4 season of loneliness and especially the Sean Combs produced Come On), but also a lot of average titles (like the two B2M albums before)."
3,Pretty good...,"I think this CD is pretty good, but it just didn't live up to previous releases for me. It just seemed like it wasn't exactly very ""Boyz II Men"" like. Not exactly their style. There were some awesome moments on it, however."
5,this c.d. rules.,"I think this was the best Boyz 2 men cd ever made.You guys are great.Wanya,Mike,Nathan,and Shawn you guys rule.E-Mail me sometime please."
2,Too slow and repetitive,"Usually I love Boyz II Men, and I like slow songs, but a whole CD of nothing but slow songs can get very repetitive and boring. I liked ""Doin Just Fine"", but the rest of it just sounded the same! There was no variety. They are very talented, but they need to perk up a little bit!"
2,11 predictable,this album lacked the freshness of there second album and faded fast from my memory.still they are the best current vocal group out there on the 90's scene.
5,Boyz II Men....five stars isn't good enough for Evolution.,"Boyz II Men, you guys did a great job on Evolution. I think that on this CD, each and every song was great. II had chart toppers and some that weren't. Likewise for Cooleyhighharmony. Evolution was great all the way through and Boyz II Men definitely deserves all accolades for this album. Purdue University says, ""Great job""."
5,The Best CD they made so far,"Boyz 2 Men are one of the only male groups today that can win everyone hearts no matter what their age especially with the new CD we can understand why. They just blend so well like there voices were ment to be together. with songs like "" A song for Mama"" and ""Doin'Just Fine for people who haven't seen it is a beautiful video."" They will be around for a long time to come. Nate, Shawn, Mike, and Wanya I love you all and keep doing what your doing."
5,Checkin out daddy's cds pays off well!,"Boyz II Men have really done a good job on this album. i found evolution when i was going through my dad's cd collection so i took it and put it in my discman. since i put it in i cant take it out. i love this album from begining to end. Boyz II Men have very meaningful and sincere lyrics unlike so many groups out there today. My favourite songs on here are ""4seasons"", ""Never"", ""Doin just fine"", ""Mama"" and ""To the limit"". everyone should have this cd. PEACE"
5,Best Album Ever,"Evolution is an album that soars way above any other Boys II Men album. Their album II has more commercial value, but Evolution is pure genius. The writing and the producing of the album is what really stands out. It is a new take on an old and perfected sound. Plus the vocals are better than perfect (yes, better than perfect). If you have not heard this album, then you are missing more than you can imagine. GET THIS ALBUM NOW."
4,Street Musician Makes Good!,"Only in San Francisco would you ever find a musician that calls himself Carlos Guitarlos. Guitarlos has been called a fallin' angel, a drunken doofus and one hell of a blues player by one San Francisco newspaper. Guitarlos' chosen venue has been the streets, playing on the corner of 16th and Mission for enough tips to by him some beverages and something to eat. The toothless one has now emerged as somewhat of a San Francisco icon of the blues. On this release Guitarlos joins with a band of other San Francisco regulars for 17 original tunes averaging a little better than two minutes a piece. It is an eclectic mix of tunes some with an R&B flavor, some sounding a bit Bo Diddleyish but all are truly straight from the heart. I was skeptical at first, but after one listen, I was hooked. Give Guitarlos a listen, he deserves a break."
2,DO NOT buy twisty belly button rings,"I bought this thinking it was going to be SO cute. First off, it just looks really weird when you put it in. Second, the balls are like a see-through orange and do not look like the picture at all. Not a good buy all around."
4,strange...,"It is not the way that Sakamoto used to delight us. It is rather a begining of a new era, a ""sampled"" era. The album is ok, except the first track - Too comercial(that's what I think)...The best track nr2 and 14.However, strange album - gut but strange..."
4,good Biblically based advice,"I have read several books on this subject, and what distinguishes this one is a thorough discussion on the Biblical basis of divorce and remarriage. The book, written in the 70s, is somewhat dated in its references to society, but overall very helpful."
1,Go To YouTube and Download for FREE,"Anna Wintour is always interesting, but this DVD takes advantage of our interest. It is SHORT, and not worth spending your money on. WAY TOO MUCH MONEY for what you get. I'm not sure who should be more ashamed . . . amazon or 60 minutes. This DVD is a rip off!!10/18/09 -- Since I first wrote this review, I found this entire segment could be downloaded from YouTube . . . not only for free, but of a much better quality than this DVD (the sound was horrible on my copy)."
4,Stunning 10 years later and counting,"My brother in law gave this TV to me under one condition. Get it out of his house withoutdamaging anything in the process. I thought to myself ""no problem"" only to find out laterjust how BIG & HEAVY this thing was, wow! Not an easy task but I got it done.Shortly after placing it in my man cave the convergence board died. After several quotesto get it fixed I settled in at $327. For a free TV I figured ""what the heck"" and went for it.6 years later and it still works perfect! Even with a 42 inch LCD Sony XBR upstairs I stillprefer heading to the cave for a good football game. Plugged into a fullsurround sound system it really has a nice ""Theater"" feel. This thing is 10 years old (going on 11)and still kicks out a beautiful vibrant and colorful picture. If it weren't for the convergenceboard failing I'd give it 5 stars. Hope she goes another 10 years...."
1,don't waste your money,"Worst bike i've owned.Chains keep slipping off even on flat terrain, brakes are terrible. OK for the price, but if you want real mountain bike, save your money and buy something else."
4,Allright bike for a cheep price,"over all the bike is all right, there isn't much to say about it although the front brakes arn't that good."
1,Lasted less than a year..,"I bought this bike to do some modest exercise.10 miles a day in about 45 minutes, 6-7 days a week, around the neighborhood on surface streets.Nothing crazy.At first the quality of the bike seemed good and I had no problems with it. Last week however, thetroubles started with a popped rear tire due to a worn through spot on the tire were the inner-tubestarted poking through. After less than a year the tire was already down to threads.And this morning, the rear derailleur broke off and the whole drive is just a big, broken mess. Trash.Had to walk home and get the bike home with my car.So, I went ahead and ordered a Schwinn bike here on Amazon, hoping that it will last a bit longer than10 months.I would not recommend this bike to anyone because of the low quality. You get what you pay for.."
2,It was alright untill...,"The bike arrived completely fine. While assembling it i had to go buy a wrench that i didn't have and the tires did not have the required pressure so i went out to buy a bike air pump.After the assembling was finished (the instructions are not that great, specially the part that involves setting up the brakes for the front wheel)i started to ride the bikeAfter thirty minutes of use, a part of the gear that holds the chain broke off...I have now returned the bike to amazon and i am waiting for a refundAccording to the reviews here the bike is pretty good, so i am sure i just got unluckyI went out to a retail store and bought a daimondback mountain bike instead together with a two year warranty so i do not have to worry about the bike breaking down on me again..."
1,Dont Buy!!,"Well where do I start... It seemed like it was too good to be true and it was.... Dont get me wrong this is a nice bike if you want to ride around the streets or your yard but do NOT take this to any kind of trails and expect it to make it out alive. When mine arrived the fork was bent and the rims where WAY out of whack. I put it together to take a quick ride around the neighbor hood to get my adjustments in and that is where the real fun began... Its shifts like a manual transmission when you dont have your clutch on, the chained fell off about 3 times and this was just riding down the street not a trail! I didnt even dare try a trail because I am sure it would have fallen apart mid ride. Do yourself a favor and buy a bike from a LBS if you have any plans on taking it anywhere fun otherwise if you want to ride in your front yard or streets then I guess have at it"
1,"Falling apart within the first month, not big enough for a man, gears slip","* Pedal fell off within the first week.* Gear cluster started making loud noise on each revolution, in the first month.* Gears routinely shift by themselves - I have hurt myself a few times with a knee into the handlebars when the gears slipped.* This is not a ""Men's"" bike - I am an average 5'10"", and even with the seat extended an inch beyond the max line, I have to stand up another 2-3 inches to get my leg straight."
3,Good but not Great!!!!,"I got this bike base on the review i read online. This bike is for someone that just wants to ride a bike not for advance mountain biking. Also I feel the products on this bike this very cheap made. I am going to ride the bike for a week, might be returning it."
3,durability,this bike is ok. but after the first few rides on a SERIOUS mountain bike riding trip. you would need to change the plastic pedals.suspension works great.good bike!!
1,Do not buy!,"This bike looks great, but is a pain to put together. The front wheel doesnt even fit in the slot. If it was for a friend, i would have not been able to put this bike together myself. The front suspension does nothing! The gears dont change properly. I recommend buying from a local bike shop!"
3,Okay for a cheap bike,"I got this bike to see if I could get back in to the good old sport of mountain biking. This bike was a good encouragement...but I had a few problems with it even after getting it tuned twice.1) The brakes were never tight enough.2) The chains were slipping off and hitting the wheels.3) The wheels were out of line.But all in all, for the price...I can't really complain...but I'll probably get a new bike as soon as this one falls apart even more."
5,Great Inexpensive Aluminum Mountain Bike,"After 6 months of use I have no problems with the two bikes that I have. You need to tighten all the nuts and bolts, even the ones that were not involved in the assembly.You need to tune the bike gears and brakes regularly.I didn't need to buy any additional parts and am happy with the bikes performance."
2,"Adequate, eventually","This tripod is easy to setup for hands-free shower usage, but the nozzle hangs too low for stand-up showers. In part because I've hacked in a much better shower head for the Zodi hose that hangs even lower, I also had to hack an extension for the upright to get the entire rig to hang just above my head (I'm 5'10; thankfully my shower hut is 7' :). If you need to raise the curved piece, a piece of 3/4"" white PVC tubing slides right over the tubes with enough support for the top piece and the shower head, without throwing off the tripod balance too badly.Also, on first assembly, we found how poorly the curved piece at the top was welded to the supporting upright; it came off in my hands with very little pressure applied (the other reason why the PVC sleeve became necessary; I have no welding facilities, and didn't think solder would be as strong as I needed.)It looks good in principle, but the low height and cheap manufacture work against it in my books."
2,Great for midgets,"Quality is only fair, and the unit is so short that you have to stoop to take a shower.I dumped the pole and stand and used the hose and shower head by fastening it to the top of the Zodi shower enclosure, and it worked fine."
4,Pretty Happy!,"This stuffed puppy is very cute and the fur is quite soft. The head is filled with fluff and beanie stuffing in the rest of the body. In the picture the tag is in a plastic cover, but the actual product does not include this. Not a problem, but something to note.In addition, the body was less filled than I anticipated, but that's not a problem either. The puppy is still cute and cuddly, which is its purpose anyway!Fetch came two business days earlier than the estimated arrival date in a plastic bag in a box with air pillows for shipping safety, along with another product I ordered.Recommended to any stuffed animal or Beanie Baby fanatic or collector!"
4,Casio calculator,"I received the Casio(R) HR-100TEPlus Printing Calculator in a timely manner and was pleased that it was like new as advertised. However, I believe that there was a tiny piece missing, it was a bar or something that goes between the two paper roll supports that the paper roll sits on. I used a piece of an old paint brush and inserted it there and it works just fine. The printer itself is great and one of the main reasons I ordered from this vendor is that he said it had the AC adapter."
2,Not for Serious Student,"This video may be great for housewives who just like to get in shape.As a dance and yoga student, every part of the tape was mediocre level and frustrating. With one look at her movement, I could tell that the trainer was not a dancer nor a yoga practiioner. In ""Yoga"" part, she often was in incorrect position and in ""Dance"" part, some movement was introduced as a hip opener while they were not. I am almost certain she is a weight trainer who, without a good enough background in ballet or Yoga to be a trainer, decided to incorporate them to attract broad range of customers.I am sorry I bought into it."
2,Trash and more trash,"The author milks a few facts about the dislike each star had for the other and drags it out for a full length book. It all gets very tiresome and disagreeable after a while. There are no insights, only the empty and silly portrayal of two childish and sick women having a catfight for decades. We are all fortunate that both of these miserable creatures are no longer with us. It might have made an amusing article but nothing more."
2,Camp tittle-tattle,"Only mildly entertaining because so little of it rings true. The frequent quotes are often as not from the columns of Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper or from a gossip magazine called Motion Picture, yet they are treated as fact. There is little analysis of the artistry and ravishing beauty of Crawford and Davis' film work.The endless exchanges of witless, bitchy quips is, in the end, deadening and depressing."
3,Bette and Joan The Divine Feud - Kindle Edition,"I am a classic movie enthusiast and thoroughly enjoyed the stories behind the feud. BUT, the typographical errors are unforgivable. How can a book with so many typos be published? I stopped counting when I reached 20. Maybe it was because I purchased the Kindle Edition, nevertheless, it is inexcusable. (By the way, I found none in the ""Hello Gorgeous"" book about Streisand, also a Kindle Edition.)"
1,Second hand rubbish,Many books have covered this territory in a fuller fashion.Anything is better than this [tabloid]type trash.
4,"catty, queeny fun","this book can't be trusted-- too many unattributed quotes. based on my having read so many other joan and bette biographies, however, it appears to tonally, if not factually accurate. in any event, it is great fun; it's the book that got me started on all those other bios in the first place."
5,Stunning,Who said educational had to be boring. I watched this for a ocean studies class and for once what seems in a long time I didnt fast foward anypart. It's gives a nice slice view of whats in our oceans.
3,A Little Unbelievable,Miranda was separated from her traveling party in the previous book and in this book we find her in the able hands of Teddy Davenport. Teddy is a botanist in Alaska studying the trees and plants. In the presence of Miranda Teddy's heart opens to new ideas even though he is committed to his work.Grace is struggling with not knowing where her husband is or if he wants to be with her anymore. She gives birth to their child and feels regretful that her husband hasn't seen the child. She also feels bad that her and her child are a burden to her friends. What will happen between Grace and her husband?In this book Tracie did another great job in continuing the story line but some of the stuff gets a little unbelievable. The characters have a barely faltering faith. I mean they struggle with it but the next minute they're fine. Otherwise this book was great!
4,Detailed info very helpful,"The details of what is seen in the various areas are very helpful. Fodors takes you town by town in an orderly fashion with helpful information in planning your trip.I found that after reading this book, my vacation plans were changed to accomodate more sightseeing. It was very beneficial."
4,cheap but does the work.,"good one, does the work for less price. I returned the expensive one (18$) which I bought earlier from walmart."
3,Works so-so,"Yes, it'll attracts beetles, but usually within the first hour you open the bait. Then, it doesn't do anything. The busiest time I saw it working was when it was fresh. Tt's been hanging now for a week and it has the same amount of dead beetles in the bag from the first hour opened. So, it works but not going to get rid of them if your plants are completely covered."
3,A book for novice dog owners,"This is probably a good book for someone who has never owned any kind of dog; however, I was looking for a book with breed-specific information. I found more information searching the Internet about the idiosyncrasies of the corgi breed than I did from this book."
1,Not worth buying,"Other than having cute pictures of corgi dogs, about half of this book is boiler plate stuff that applies to all dogs: how to train a puppy, what dogs need in terms of exercise, yada yada. Get a different book if you want information on corgis."
2,Nothing that I would have used,"I didn't find anything in this entire book I could have used, even some things that I thought might be worth getting had expired offers. All in all a disappointment."
1,A waste of time!,"I found this book completely useless except for a paperweight or doorstop! What I did find interesting is that Vickie Adkins-Marcum seems to review all of Matthew Lesko's books. Of course Vickie highly exalts him using such phrases as ""KUDOS to Matthew Lesko! He's making this a better place!"" For those of you who are a little slow, let me inform you that Vickie Adkins-Marcum is really Matthew Lesko, or someone Matthew gave this review to and paid Vickie to post it. It's strange that Vickie's reviews all start out with the same first paragraph and have many of the same phrases throughout. It is also strange that Vickie only reviews Matthew's books. Shame on you Matthew Lesko for writing your own review!"
4,Entertaining Entry into the Series,"This second ""Eerie"" novel by John Peel (the famous UK DJ??? OK, probably not) is a vast improvement on ""Burea of Lost"" (Eerie #2). The story is witty, fast paced, entertaining and, for once, not modelled after an episode from the TV show.One complaint: For a series that I've noted before as being incredibly faithful to its source material, I was disappointed to see that Peel got one detail wrong here. Dash is identified at one point as ""Dash Check"" whe in the series his name was ""Dash X"" (he got his name from the markings on his hand which read X and -). I know, I know...no big deal but this seemed like a pretty sloppy error to me."
3,Two reissued 1980's romance novels.,Rekindled by Barbara Delinsky is reissue of two pervious romance novels. Lilac Awakening (1982) was the better of the two books.Flip Side of Yesterday (1983) was strange story of two professional people who meet again 11 years after a memorable one-night stand. The main female character and no self-esteem and had not another sexually partner since the one-night stand. The male character fell in love way too fast but he did have some memorable qualities. I would give this book 1 stars.Lilac Awakening (1982) was novel of two people find themselves sharing a cottage in remote Vermont and build a friendship and then love. I found this story had some great characters and was nice short read for winter storm day. I would give this book 3 1/2 stars.
3,So - So,"The Flip Side was too short and too sweet to give satisfaction. Cotton Candy that costs too much and melts too fast. Not real.Lilac also pretty unreal, but better ... and the scene where she discovers his identity I read several times, cause it was good. Both heroines have backbone, both menfolk are attractive, but the lack of length also limits to a lack of depth that this spoiled Delinsky reader found disappointing."
2,Forgettable,"This book was a waste of my time. I have read Ms. Delinsky's books in the past and have found them ok. However, this book was boring. There are two different stories and I would be unable to recall anything about either. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
5,The Best,"I'm a Blank and Jones fun from thier CD ""In Da Mix"" '99. Hits like Cream and After Love chenged trance music. After that all other CD's were OK. But MONUMENT is THE BEST B&J CD EVER. I'm sorry I didn't go live show of Monument on the promo tour."
2,unoriginal,"I'm very disappointed with this CD. Several tracks on here are rip-offs/derivatives/spins of tracks on BT's ""Emotional Technology"" album.1. The intro track that has seemingly random noises and music clips directly parallels BT's intro track.2. If you compare ""What You Need"" with BT's ""Knowledge of Self,"" that just so happens to be track 2 on BT's album as well, the comparisons are obvious: bass lines are similar, the timing of the beats, the tempo, similar sounding vocal samples, etc.3. Other tracks on here are also sound vaguely similar to BT and other popular artists like Above & Beyond, etc.If you were thinking that this CD sounded different than Blank & Jones' normal stuff, you're right.."
2,Not what I was expecting!,"Though Adela Noriega is my all time favorite female protagonista (female lead) and Eduardo Yanez is one of my favorite male protagonista I did not enjoy this telenovela. It did have 3 CDs but I didn't think the plot of the novela had substance and didn't think it flowed well. Being a fan of telenovelas I know how a novela should flow and felt that this one was a bit off. For true fans I would say that it is a ""nice"" novela to add to your collection but it is not a ""must"" have."
3,"Liked it, But...","Let me say first that I love those couple, Adela and Eduardo are both gorgeous and they have great chemistry and if it was only about them i would've gave them 6 stars, but I did not based my opinion on this telenovela! This a nice story although the whole teacher- student - shrink - patient relationship is a little sick and unacceptableBut if they wanted to bring this telenovela to DVD why not pick ""Guadalope"" which is also old and with same couple but 100 times better and I really see it as the BEST TELENOVELA EVER. And if anyone does have it on DVD I am willing to pay him/her 100 dollars for it and that's how good I think it is!"
3,pretty good,"its awesome I got my delivery within days, very good soapopera very good service can't complain"
3,dulce desafio,"i was unable to play it on my dvd but on my computer in the office. it also lack audio. i only understood it from the subtitles. however, the film is interesting. i really wished i could view it at home"
2,could be more helpful,"There are limited Tamil resources available in the US, and this was the first dictionary/phrasebook I found. It does not use the Tamil script-- it only offers romanised words, which I find frustrating as a beginner trying to learn how to spell Tamil words. The phrases seem useful; the two-page cultural overviews and tourist tips are just half-hearted attempts. It's better than nothing, but not a substitute for a more complete dictionary."
3,Misleading Book Title,"In my opinion, the book title should have been ""Dictionary & Phrase Book For A Traveler""!Otherwise the book is useful."
2,A big disappointment,"The part of the headphones that touch your ears is made of HARD PLASTIC. No cushioning at all, and sadistically uncomfortable. They also make a constant clicking sound when you walk or job. It's a shame, because otherwise this is a good product with a very good radio tuner."
4,A Good deal,"I own one of these little guys. It's fabulous! I think it is a great gadget. I wear it in the office. I can listen to my music without interupting others and I can tune others out as well.I only have a few complaints. The head gear is adjustable for length, but not width. After wearing the head piece for a few hours it feels a bit tight on the ears. However, this can not be adjusted. The sound is quite good considering how small the device is. Don't be surprised if you can not receive some stations indoors. This radio is not that powerfull. Also note that the ear pieces that actually fit on your ears are very delicate. They seem to be hanging by a fine piece of plastic. ""Do not drop this item on the floor"" the ear pieces break off and can not be re attached. ""sigh"""
4,Great product.,"great sound quality and reception, double headbands may not secure enough for jogging but are great otherwise, station presets and clock are great features."
1,I could not accept this particular radio because the FM did not workT,I had to return this radio because the FM did not work. The radio looked nice and the size was what I wanted but this particular radio did not work on FM
1,Let All buyers Beware,"I am a contractor who wears radio headphones all day when I work. When I received the headphones, I found them rather heavy and clunky, but the digital tuning and the presets were quite an improvement from what I had before and the sound quality was excellent. The next morning, I put them on and pushed the power button. Nothing. Nothing happened. I looked at the display and saw three battery icons blinking, telling me that the batteries were OK. I tried doing everything, pushing all buttons, removing and replacing the batteries,with no success. And the bloody battery icons kept blinking. So I changed the batteries, and the headset came to life. One hour later I turned off the headset to talk to someone. When pushed the power button...nothing...and there were the three battery icons blinking,blinking. Since then I have tried many times to make the thing come to life with no success."
3,They just don't last,"This product is why I stopped buying Sony forever. Having had a few minor issues with various products before, I bought one of these when they 1st came out 30+ yrs ago. It was about $100 back then! It died in 14 months on a 12 month warranty. Sony said SORRY DUDE! So I wrote the president of Sony USA basically saying WTF is up with you guys? They replaced it. That one lasted 4 yrs.This product is typically Sony WAAAAAY over engineered, clunky to use, but nobody else made a product close to it, so you are stuck. If you want all-weather non-corded radios that have a digital tuner, this is it. Here we are 30 yrs later and still nobody makes a product like this (there are a few exceptions that are actually worse quality). So the used market for this item remains strong..... Buyer beware...I am on my 5th one. They just don't last....."
1,Piece of junk; Sony's quality is fading quickly!!,"This radio, at first sign, is great. But, live with it for a while and you will change your attitude quickly.First of all, the plastic that contacts your ears is hard and funky, which is painful after 10 minutes or so. Second, the battery life is HORRIBLE!! I get 1 3-hour baseball game's worth at best. I get a message in the display stating that the battery life is gone, then I can remove and replace the batteries and get more life. Good or bad? This sucks, because the excessive handling and ineffective display are a joke!!I own many other Sony products and I feel that they are living off of their past branding successes. It is apparent to me that they are no longer ""top of the line"" and are cutting too many corners on the quality. Color me gone!!"
1,Headset disappointment,The Headset never worked properly from day one. It wouldnt stay on. Kept turning on and off. Very disappointed with the purchase.
2,Sony Walkman,The battery cover is broken and you need tape to keep the batteries in place.I will never buy a refurbished product from you again.
2,Purchase a better copy,"I would warn other Amazon customers to avoid purchasing this book. Not only is it full of typographical errors, I have the distinct impression errors were made in reproducing some of the dialogue! This is quite evident in the Narcissus short story. Quite honestly, the book appears to have been done very quicly and on the cheap. Corners were definitely cut to make this price point! I would recommend you purchase a version by another publisher."
4,Great Insight,"Originally published in 1897this book is considered to be the turning point in Conrad's career. The book has also been published under the title The Children of the Sea: A Tale of the Forecastle.This is a very good short novel. It has strong characters, great navel insight and is a study of the character of men. It also has to do with the lives of men in general - the good, the bad, and the indifferent.In an interesting way it weaves a tale of deceit that becomes a reality. James ""Jimmy"" Waits, a west Indian black sailor waits for illness and is waiting for death.It explores not only the deceits of men, but how man deals with illness and death in confined space. It was an excellent read."
2,"Fine writing, disappointing print quality",Conrad's fine prose is marred by countless printing errors in this Digiread version. Frequent missing characters and even whole words interfere with the pleasure of reading and demonstrate Digiread's lack of concern for quality.
4,Good venture!,"First, the pro-s: -1. The introductory story by Mike Resnick was fabulous. It has been a long time since a pulp aventure was so funny.2. Some of the stories made me wish for more works by the same authors, something rare nowadays.3. The publication-features are superb, as in all other Monkeybrain books.Now, the con:-Despite the tall claims of Chris Roberson, this anthology contains several non-pulp high-brow items that fit more properly into Gardner Dozois anthologies, rather than into books claiming to be pulp-style.However, in these barren times, I would definitely look forward to purchasing the 2nd volume next year. Maybe, there will be some more jewels!"
3,A good try at an old-school adventure compilation,"Well, overall, I enjoyed it...or some of it. The compilation bills itself as a return to the pulpy days of high adventure, thereby conjuring up images of Indiana Jones. Some of these stories pull this off. Others don't. Some are much too ""literary"" in their form and some seem rather juvenile. Some fell short of their mark - ""The 400 Slaves"" comes to mind. Only one or two left me thinking, ""Wow!"" I might...just might...buy another volume (if one comes out) but I would have to think about it. Too much ""modern short story"" (pinkies out now) and not enough adventure."
4,Beanie baby,"It was what I expected, it arrived on time, and it was satisfactory to the person that I gifted it to."
2,"Talk Talk, it sure ain't. Nothing to dance to here.","I bought this hoping for some of the excitement bottled in Talk Talk's greatest hits disc. Instead, this is a sparse, minimalist plate of acoustic jazz. Mark Hollis's shimmering voice barely makes it our of the garage on this set. Talk Talk fans' money would be better spent simply mopping up whatever 'Talk' records you don't already have."
5,Stunning and Beautiful,"Without question, this is the finest album I have heard in some time. Mark Hollis continues to be an amazing talent. The approach is similar to what he was doing with Talk Talk; but the execution is much more subtle. The result is a stunning and beautiful album of unparalleled depth. One can only hope that we will not have to wait another seven years to hear from this remarkable composer."
5,The quiet genius of Mark Hollis,"This is an incredible album, and gets better with repeated listenings. Personally, I make quiet time in the dark and watch out windows while listening to this - so, it takes patience to adapt your ear to it, even as a fan, but it's well worth it in spades when you settle in to it. Great piece of work - we need more like this from Hollis. He's a genius."
4,An Inspirational Journey,"The Women Who Raised Me provides an intimate insight into the life of a celebrity who has fought against the odds to develop a life of meaning and inspiration to those who know her. Most touching was the fondness of her memories of people who helped her and those who did not support her to the fullest, recognising that every encounter made her the women she is today. Her tenacity and persistence is an inspiration to us all to continue through difficult times. The women who helped her throughout her life also provide inspiration for us to open our homes, lend a hand, or even just say a kind word to those around us. We may never know the impact we have on people. Thank you Victoria for sharing your life story with us."
4,Strong woman,i really liked the fact Victoria gives reconition to the women who helped shape her life and the fact that she took a lot of negetives and turned them into positives i actually ienjoyed reading this book.
1,Why is this book on the NYTimes Best Seller List???,Our entire book club read this book and came away with the exact same thought - why is this book on the NYTimes Best Seller list? The book was anticlimactic and at many times down right boring. Definitely one that can be skipped if you are trying to select a good book to read this summer.
2,Wanted more of an autobiography,"I know the title says the women who raised me, but I really wanted to read more about how she got into acting, what it was like to be on the young and the restless and work with dick van dyke. She spends many chapters about her ballet years, but doesnt mention what it was like to get into tv acting, which is really her career, not ballet. She is known for being a TV star. She did a great deal of research into her families/friends - I think too much. I had to skip many many pages because it got boring. She mentions her marriage, but never talks about getting divorced. I never knew if she married Wynton or not, had to look it up on the net. She doesn't get into her relationships with men much or her children. I got the impression Wynton was raising her son? but who knows. She seems very multi talented though and it was great that she put so much time into writing a book in addition to her other charities/career."
1,DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED,"I was expecting a great read. Instead, I got a long, drawn-out, account of the individual foster mothers. It seems to me that if they were so loving they would have put forth a better effort to keep custody. I also feel that Ms. Rowell gives her birth mother credit that is not warranted. She is quick to point out her mother's ""beauty"" in her youth, i.e., ""creamy skin"", etc. This great ""beauty"" is not apparent to me. This statement alone is surprising coming from a strong black woman such as Rowell. Her mother cared absolutely nothing for her, ""schizophrenic"" or not, yet her name is first on Rowell's thank-you list. Please do not waste money on this book. Not one interesting character. I can't wait to sell this and be reimbursed. This is truly the worst book I have ever read - I had to skip half of the chapters because they were so repetitive."
5,Unforgettable! Deeply Inspiring and moving.,"A deeply inspiring, astounding and moving book that is superbly well written. Kudos and blessings to you Vicki!"
3,Interesting,This is a story about a very interesting woman and her family and friends. The writing and quality of the book are not exceptional.
2,Lemon,I Purchased a GMC envoy 700c in July and it seemed great when it was working but it never did for very long. The first thing that happened was both brake calipers falling apart followed by a brake pully snapping and then the other brake pully snaped. Then I noticed that The rear derailer no matter how it was adjusted would not function properly. I brought it to a bike shop and they descovered that the derailer cables were incorrectly installed as well as a flaw on the rear of the frame where the bike tire and rear derailer attached to the bike. As long as you dont get a incorrectly welded frame and are willing to replace brake calipers this bike should be ok for some one wanting a economy road bike.
5,Have been searching for a puzzle like this!,"This was a gift I purchased for a friend who had gone to school in Chicago and fell in love with the city. She wanted a picture or puzzle of the sky line to remind her of her time there. After searching for a while this one seemed to be one of the better ones out there. It's a really neat picture and has the added bonus of being a puzzle, which I think makes it more interesting. She and her husband put it together this winter and they love it! Great product!"
3,watch the fitment,I wish they had a picture of the other end of the plugs because not all Imprezas or Impreza Outbacks are consistent. I had to go to AutoZone & hold up the old wires to compare to three different boxes. Better not order a part unless you know it's going to fit. My car is a 97 Impreza L but it has some aspects of an Impreza Outback in terms of the ignition coil & wires. Like they just had a box of extra parts on one line but were a box short on the other line so the factory workers handed the box over ;)
3,Good but Bad,"I don't know really where to begin. I read this book thinking that every detail would be correct, every word of dialogue would be correct but it wasn't. I caught so many mistakes that it became a question to whether or not he really even watched the movie. I have seen Rear Window many many times, and can recite the dialogue almost word for word. I couldn't believe that so many things were wrong! I did enjoy the photos, but that's about it. The way that the book is set up is excellent, and yes, he does have some of his information right. If anyone is a die-hard Hitchcock fan who's favorite movie is Rear Window, you need to read this book. If you catch the mistakes like me, then you know you really are the fan you say you are!"
1,boring!,"i really like ""Rear Window"" and i thought this would be about the MAKING OF THE MOVIE. All it was, was a script, a more detailed script, and a MORE detailed script. i wasted my money on it. :'( don't do the same!p.s. if you WANT a detailed script, then get it."
1,First Album is NOT Jagged Little Pill,"I have not read this book but by the review of it I realize I don't want to. If it states in the book that her first album was ""Jagged Little Pill"" then it's incomplete and fictional. She not only put out 2 other albums but also has music videos (inclduing one which co-stars Matt LeBlanc)."
3,pretty good but,"This is a pretty good cd. Contains the classic ""Witness Dub"" and a few other trippy techno influenced hip-hop and dub reggae type beats,plus some vocal tracks as well. The problem I have with it is the cheesy way some of the tracks are blended together as a turntable dj making the switch to digital formats this is very dicouraging. It makes the disc very difficult to work with because someone has already mixed the tracks together in a very poor sort of way. If a disc is going to have this done to it record labels should get on the ball and list them that way. Let's face vinlyl is getting expensive,but I like to support the artist so record labels here my call put out quality unmixed albums in digital formats so people like me will keep supporting you."
3,A bit better than OK,"I like roots, but this dub disc is mediocre. It's a decent effort overall but there are a couple dogs on there. The Charli-Tuna collab is pretty tight. I like about 60% of this disc."
4,Unexpected release...,"After ""Run Come Save Me"" and it's creativity, popularity, and critical success, I figured Smith for the kind of guy who would let it all go to his head and try to prove himself with another groundbreaking hiphop album. Instead, he has taken his skills on the mic and the mixer and had some genuine fun creating traditional dub cuts. I'd almost like to remove all the full-verse rap from this album and have a pure dub CD to listen to, but the alternating vocal tracks & instrumental tracks work very well..."
3,Died in < 2 years.,I owned it.It worked great as long as it worked.Died in less than 3 years without any specific reason.
5,Performance Suspension Systems,"Great product, easy install, great off-road and on-road performance. Love the Rancho product and it comes with a lifetime warranty and great tech line support.- with the HD springs - RS6416 and RS6417 you will get a 4"" lift. I'm running BFG 35x12.50x17's with no problems, with warn winch and a Rancho rear tire carrier."
5,Great ideas and insights,I am surprised that so many traders have been willing to be so candid. I got this book today and have already come up with several ideas for trading strategies. Some of these trades are likely to last for a long time due to various agency problems.
1,Just a waste of time for individual investors.,"I am the trader who is managing EZ Stock Options . com. I have been researching, developing, backtesting, and improving winning trading strategies for the past 7 years. This book has no useful information for investors. It is just talking about how in general (no details at all about strategies) he has made money for Yale University by managing their fund. Don't waste your money and more importantly your time on this book."
5,A real Jewel,"Drobny's masterpiece is terrific: he explores the age-old adage of honest academic research combined with skill and analysis to generate profits and riches. The great thing about this page-turner: Drobny's vast experience and industry-relationships allow his readers to gleen knowledge and insight that is very difficult to capture. Drobny succeeds, and the book is a must-read for anyone planning a career on Wall Street."
4,Wall Steet bound....then read this.,As a professional in the ETF business I highly recommend this book. After I read this book I gave it to my son as he recently graduated college and is planning a career on Wall Street-- It's that kind of book. Steven is well connected in the Hedge Fund world and this book is a testament to that. If you buy it to just read Jim Rogers section - your money will be well spent.
5,That's one of the CDs you juz had to have in your collection,"This sountrack is simply beyond review. I first knew about it when one of my friends brought the DVD of the movie to the company.And then it was like magic: ""I just have to get this soundtrack anyhow!!"" I would suggest that it's better to get the DVD first. Knowing the movie will eventually help you to appreciate the sondtrack more coz it's more influential together with the story. I guess not many people know about this movie in my country and I'm grat that my friend helped me discovered this WONDERFUL CD."
2,Big Let Down,"Karaoke in the title sounds like you can sing the lyrics on a karaoke machine. No words appeared on my Karaoke screen. Apparently, it is not CD+G compatible. Instead the cd has written lyrics printed in small print on the cd cover. You have to hold the words in your hand instead of a microphone.Also, the versions of each song are not original and very bland. Not worth the money."
4,Solid Record For Fans,"If you are a fan of sponge's sound, this cd is still good. They stay true and come through with some great songs, maybe some of the best songs of their career. Suicide Away is awesome, sanitarium is great when the drums kick in, unpopular girl has the classic sponge guitar sound, and dandelions roar and love & roses will satisfy fans of older songs such as have you seen mary, velveteen, molly, etc.the album also has some experimental songs that turn out decently, including treat me wrong which sounds like softcore punk with powerchords, and lucifer in las vegas mixes in western country flavor. 28 days is a rocker like wax ecstatic, but for some reason it falls short.punch in the nose is a great song too"
4,Soak This One Up,"I only recently purchased and listened to this cd. Like a review previous to mine, I totally let this Sponge cd pass me by and had no idea they even released it until I did a search here on Amazon. The songs are great and remind me a lot of Rotting Pinata - my favorite Sponge cd. Unpopular Girl, Dandelions Roar and Suicide Away take the cake on this one. If you like Sponge this one wont dissapoint you. I wish these guys would come to California a little more often. I only recall one trip through in the past 8 years and wasn't able to catch any shows. I really like these guys."
5,Best of 20th Century Christmas,"I love the Statler Brothers, love their country music, their gospel music and their Christmas music. I have had this album for many years on cassete. I was so thrilled to download it to my computer for use with today's digital media."
5,Love the Statler Brothers,"My parents purchased the LP and we would listen to it over and over. Years ago I purchased the CD....and now the simplicity of having this album in the ""cloud: makes listening that much easier. The songs are what you would expect from these timeless voices. A perfect Christmas Eve with the Statlers."
5,Wonderful music for Christmas,Having the Stattler Brothers Christmas CD sure added to our enjoyment of Christmas. What a wonderful sound.
5,Statler Fan since childhood,"I grew up listening to the Statler Brothers. My parents, aunts and uncles, and all my many cousins all were huge fans. Still to this day, the Statlers are our first music choice when we are together - we know every word of every song. And when we are together during the holidays, this is the first album we reach for. It is not Christmas until I've heard ""I beleive in Santa's cause"" and these four wonderful men singing in harmony to ""Silent Night"".These wonderful artists will be so missed in my family and many others - but no one deserves to enjoy their retirement more."
3,Forced to read it for college credit,"Parts of it were redundant. It was slow reading, but it was loaded with facts that were helpful in the course I had to take. It is not a topic I am personally interested in, but for those who are, it is probably a good read."
2,Print Quality Stinks,This is a big dictionary with tons of words but the print quality stinks. the words are really small on top of that. probably not a book for beginners. its hard to read in my opinion.
4,Geisha Boy - classic,"Is a fun classic silly Jerry Lewis flick. My 10yr old watched it and laughed with me. If you like Jerry Lewis, this ones worth the time!"
4,Better than BIC,"This tape won't get tangled like BIC brand and it is less expensive. However, it is slightly more yellow in color than BIC."
1,Forget it!,This product is the worst one I've ever used. The tape is very narrow and splits as bad as the BIC product I wanted to improve on.
5,Love this correction tape!!!,"I purchased this correction tape because it is the best you can buy for the money. It does a great job and doesn't break up like most of the others. Buy it, it is worth the price!"
1,Already broke,"I received this a couple of days ago, and after a couple of uses, the string already broke. ugh! Will not be purchasing from this brand again. Sorry."
2,Tape jammed,"I got this hoping it would not have the same problems as the other brands...but alas, the tape jammed. I was able to take it apart and ""fix"" it but it may jam again and getting it open snapped some pegs. If it jams again, it's done for....bummer."
4,"Requires precision, but delivers good results","I think the shape of the dispenser is awkward in hand. The tape seems to twist if I'm not extremely careful. If even pressure isn't maintained across the full breadth of the tape, it goes off track. ABIC Correction Tape PenI used before wasn't nearly as finicky.That said, the Tombow is much more economical in terms of cents per foot of tape, and if you catch it going off track early enough and gently push it back with a fingertip, it won't break or become unusable. I have small handwriting, and this thing is precise enough to not take out multiple lines.It's also *vastly* superior to liquid white out. It won't dry out, it won't make your papers stick together, and it won't make a mess. It thoroughly covers up markings, even those made by bold line roller ball pens."
3,Too soon to tell,"Been using this shampoo for only a couple of weeks, so it's too early to tell whether or not it will promote hair growth. It does, however, give my hair the feeling of being thicker."
3,Periscope for help around the house,"This is sold as a toy but I bought it to help me peek into a ceiling of my condo for a repair project. It turned out to be a tad too large for the vent I wanted to poke it into, my error in not measuring accurately. But it seems sturdy, well made, light weight, has large mirrors. Will find other uses for it, I am sure."
4,Lots of fun,My daughter got this and she really likes it. We used it for in her clubhouse and she thinks it is great. The mirrors can be removed so we just glued them in place and then we had no problem.
4,This book is out of print!,"I can't believe no one is publishing this duology (with A Child of Elvish) right now. I had to search all over in used bookstores before I was able to find it. Does that tell me that it's really good because no one wants to part with it or that it's no good and I can't find it because there aren't many copies around?Personally, I really enjoyed it. The first third or so was a little weakly written, but then Miss Berberick found her stride. Vivid characters, an exciting plot, and just enough hints about a mystery here and there to keep the reader engaged. I found it very difficult to put this book down at night. I would recommend this to any of my fantasy reading friends, but good luck finding a copy."
3,Very good summary of turning point year of American History,"The author concentrates on events in the year 1857 to illustrate how America got from there to the Civil war. Featuring such landmark events as the Dred Scott decision of the supreme court, the ineptness of the Buchanan administration, and the financial panic, Stampp attempts to show how this year was a turning point in our history. The problem is that he attempts to do so in a vacuum, ignoring events that went before and after, so that the view is somewhat distorted. All the same, it shows many events that are unfamiliar to the reader and enlightens on how we entered, and could have avoided, a major internal conflict only four years later."
1,Look Elsewhere,"Paul White has a nice little earner going with these titles. They actually tell you very little specific, practical information about each subject. They do however contain a lot of generalisations which anyone with a slight understanding of audio engineering could come up with. The book on digital audio didn't even include a means of calculating how much disk space is required for digital audio files, something that is very important as well as fundamental to the subject. Every book also contains between 50 and 70 pages of the same glossary."
5,A story written for the ages.,"A man who finds himself in the most perilous situation, returns from war to find himself married to a remarkable woman. Places may have changed while he was good and people, but true love never surrenders to the adversities of outside makings. this whole series is a must read."
5,Regency Romance and Beauty & the Beast Theme Combine with an Unusual Twist!,"In a twist of fate, beauty becomes and beast and the beast becomes the beauty! I LOVED IT...but then I have a special fondness for tortured heroes. Bryceson Wakefield returns from war, scarred inside and out, to a wife who has blossomed into a beauty, also inside and out. This is his heart-wrenching and emotional story of healing and of finding love with own his wife. An excellent, very romantic read! Annette Blair's Rogue series is not to be missed!"
4,Rogue fun continues,"I have to admit it took me a while to get into this book. For some reason it just didn't grab me as the first one did. However, once I got into it, I was not disappointed. I think Ms. Blair is a masterful writer who definitely knows how to keep a reader enthralled. Her descriptions are terrific and of course, historically accurate.I especially enjoyed the parts where Alex was seducing Hawk and getting advice from the sister in law. The book made me laugh at times and hold my breath at others. Definitely a keeper."
3,This is the third Rogue book-my least favorite,"So far this is my least favorite of the three rogue books I have read. It was not as good as the others, but it was a fun read and I did enjoy the plot and the characters. Since I enjoyed the others so immensely, I didn't want to miss this one and would have read it even if I knew ahead of time it wasn't quite as good as the others."
5,the Unforgettable Rogue,The Unforgettable Rogue by Annette Blair has an excellent story line. I enjoyed reading this book.I like stories that include characters in a series of books
5,unforgettable rovue,"Do not miss the books in this series. They are enjoyable, full of romance, excitement, and a page turning read. The heroine is always a strong character capable of standing up to her man, who ends up adoring his lady."
3,Great purpose/bad audio,"Love the premise of Samson's Way...enjoyed watching it, but it cannot be shown to a classroom effectively because the audio is poor (obviously recorded on the actual video taping device, which is in the crowd).An idea for future productions...record it either through a sound board where the actors have individual mikes or simply record it without an audience in attendance."
4,Glasgow Electronic Highlights,"Mount Florida is the Glasgow region where electronic musician M.P. Lancaster and club DJ Twitch (from club Sonora, and Optimo) collaborate on a mixture of dub, bleeps, noises and harmonies which walk the thin line between progressive post-rock electronica and downtempo trip-hop. This is their first EP, released by Matador Europe. Pretty cool. Everywhere I played this, people asked me about it."
4,A nice book to kill some free time,"I bought this book along with ""Robert Young Pelton's The World's Most Dangerous Places"" and a few Lonely Planet series while planning to backpacking trip in Southeast Asia. Very helpful information, although much of it revolve around common sense, but I would definitely recommend reading it"
5,Great overall reveiw of survival methods.,I have not totally read this since it is a present for my brother in Aug. I thumbed through it and what I looked at and read are excellent things to know. I assume the rest of the material is the same. I think my brother will appreciate it and enjoy reading it. Pauline Maxwell
4,The Noise Upstairs,"As a person growing up in the '50's in NC, I identify very well well the events, the intriques, the subtle (and not so subtle) racism, favoritism and ""classism"" that Stark writes about. The descriptions could have been my own, if I were a writer and could express myself as well as Stark. Even though this is a work of fiction set in a real place and time, I wonder how many other mysteries (even more horrible that this) actually did happen -- maybe I don't want to know. I've always heard that ""truth is stranger than fiction"". And what ""skeletons"" are in other people's closets? It made me realize that I was lucky to have had a ""normal"" (I hope) childhood. Stark tells an intriguing tale -- I look forward to his next novel. It is hard to believe that this was his first!!"
5,The Noise Upstairs,Having grown up in Wilson and knowing the places he wrote about made this book a none stop reading marathon. Lucien's description of life in Wilson and the summer of '57 was real. I have recommended the book to everyone I know and especially old friends from Wilson.
1,I found it to be unusable.,This software came with my HP 300i DVD burner which I purchased during July 2003. It may have worked with a given set of hardware and video formats in the lab but it did not work for me. Most of the time it either reported that the file format was incompatable or crashed. It even took XP down with it ! Note that ULEAD's products (and others) had no problems with these files.I see this product as a black mark for Arcsoft and HP. It seems the neither of these firms took the time to do realistic testing prior to shipping it. HP has promised an updated version but we are still waiting 3 months latter.
2,A buggy vesion 2.0,"I have made some nice DVDs using Showbiz 2.0, but man was it frustrating. Examples: It does not tell you until burn time that your 1 hour 25 minute video won't fit on a 2-hour disk. There is no ""undo"" when typing titles. Try to get from the authoring screen to the EDIT screen and the button is greyed out; it takes 1 or 2 pointless clicks to get it to appear. It won't capture until video is present, so you have to rewind your source to get the beginning, then edit out the rewind. With the HP device it was bundled with, it arbitrarily quits in the middle of capture. Hope you folks can point me to something better for my next purchase."
1,Won't burn DVDs,"I too spent a great deal of time working on a project and then found that the system crashed every time I tried to burn a DVD. The editing portion itself is good for anyone starting out doing their own video editing, but if you ever hope to transfer it to DVD then don't bother with this product. Mine came bundled with my HP 200i but won't work at all with this DVD burner. Repeated attempts to get technical help from Arcsoft has just been met with silence on their end - perhaps they too are in the dark as to the problems with this product..."
1,The worst!,"ShowBiz is a study in frustration! I only regret that I can't rate it less than 1 star. The program specializes in computer crashes. It simply will not efficiently allow you to create a project, load and edit it, then burn it out to DVD. Along this fairly straight forward route you will encounter repeated error messages including Windows telling you that it needs to shut down ShowBiz because it has created errors. I re-installed the software and even borrowed a second program -- all to no avail. ShowBiz simply will not perform. I gave up and switched to ULead Video Studio 7 and have had NO trouble since. Don't waste your time, effort and frustration on this dog."
1,"Wish it would work, buggy performance and no support","Software doesn't work as advertised, I have yet to create a clean DVD output. Captures video okay but Write to DVD and Export do not work. Both quit partially into the process and report that the operation was successful when the finished file or DVD only contains part of the data. You can watch the progress jump from xx% to 100% in one step with no errors reported. In export it appears to be a problem with handling larger than 2 GByte files, in write to DVD the stop point appears to be random.Multiple questions to Arcsoft have only resulted in automated replies. Replies to the replies as Arcsoft requests only result in the return message that there server did not accept the reply.I would avoid all Arcsoft products."
1,Might Work by Version 20,"Odd...it's very human-friendly, but very computer unfriendly...Software is usually the other way around, isn't it? OK, the UI is fine and I'm able to put together a running video no problem. But, like the other users have complained, it often tweaked my OS (OK, I'm still on Windows 98', but it should work anyway) and absolutely REFUSED to burn DVDs. Like one of the other users here, I was mortified to discover this after spending hours putting together a presentation...and simply had nothing to show for it at the end of the day.Best to look elsewhere."
4,good read.,"I have read Into Angels and consider it a very good example of its genre. Lively characters,who interact very well. A must for the Christmas stocking. Well done Esme."
3,The birds must like this piece!!!,"For the price it is okay - BUT, you can hear some sparrows chirping nearby as this was recorded."
4,Cute Lamb,"Cute Ty Beanie Babies Lamb - received it in like new condition. My only complaint is that for a Beanie Baby, it was really lacking the bean stuffing inside making it very floppy compared to other ones I have. Otherwise it was just fine and the person I gave it to liked it."
2,Might be good,"If you are familiar with this type of calculator and its funtions then it might be a good calculator to have.But, if you are not, then good luck figuring out how to use it. Setting the date and time is easy once you figure out the cryptic and 100% worthless manual.There are keys on it that I have absolutely no idea of what they are for. No picture of the key layout and what each keys function is.Yes, one that is familiar with this type of calculator may not have any problems but not all people are and there are those who would like to learn to use it properly. The examples in the manual are bad.What good is any product if the manual is so poor that you can't even begin to figure out how to use it properly and take advantage of its advanced features? If any...I went to the Canon web page and found absolutely no help there.Bottom Line:Calculator might be good if one can figure out how to fully use it. Manual is an afterthought written by either by an engineer or a lawyer."
4,Great machine BUT,"Having previously owned the same model, the updated and new features are great BUT instuction sheet could have been more detailed. All in all I'm pleased."
1,No bargain here,"This looks like a good calculator, but I am not buying it from Amazon because they have lied about the list price to make this look like a bargain. The exact same model is listed at $59.99 on Canon's web page.I'm not saying that it isn't worth $59.99. If that seems like a fair deal to you, then buy it. I am just insulted that Amazon would state a list price that isn't true to make it look like they are giving you a deal.Unethical to say the least."
5,Incognito in Concert- Ohne Filter,"This is one of the best concert dvd's I have ever seen. Having over 200 music concert DVD's in my music library, I rate this one in the top 5. This concert rates with Santana, Sade, Maze, and Mary J. Blidge. The group is off the chain , and Joy Malcolm's - SPELLBOUND and SPEECHLESS, as she flips into her cool mode is too much. If the groove does not get you, the funk will take you out! A must have for any serious collector of great music dvd's.Ron B in the Ham down south."
5,Great Purchase,The shipper did an excellent job of getting this item to me. The item came and worked just fine in a matter of days. Thanks.
5,Very useful plug,"At Christmas time the tree goes in the corner with a limited number of outlets. Now that this plug is installed in that corner we have no problem getting power for the tree, window lights and the little Christmas village.A very handy item.Oh ya, it lights up at night. So when you wake up at night for whatever reason, you don't have to put any lights on to see where you are in the room."
4,Does what it says it does ... very well,"This six-outlet adaptor converts a grounded two-outlet to six. The nightlight and safety covers are an added bounus. It is easy to install, and the screws hold it in place (you have to first remove your outlet's plate). To get it to fit snugly against the wall, you may have to tighten the scres that hold your outlet in the junction box."
3,Winning: Quick Figure handicapping,The book is kind of dated and I bought it to add to my handicapping library. I think that the method he describes works more for higher stake races.
3,Almost there...,"My wife loves this curling iron. When her original broke the spring after a year, I found replacement springs online. Then after another year the iron totally failed, and after trying several different brands we finally bought another at Amazon.She loves the size of the barrel for her hair, and the auto-off feature."
1,mom's don't buy this product,"I purchased this product so that I could relax with my 3 kids at the beach. This product is awful for one woman to set up. It is easy to pull the four corners out into a square, but to push them up and lock them into place is very, very hard. Unless you have older kids or another strong person to help, do not buy this product. Look for something that explicitly states that only one person is needed. I looked for the EZ-UP brand, and I am very disappointed. This should not be called an EZ-up."
3,good item but....,"Attractive, good materials, easy to raise and the rolling bag is nice. But be very careful in raising the support poles and braces. Very easy to warp or bend the braces just a bit out of shape and then the product is pretty much shot. Wanted some tech help from the company on putting stronger bolts, connectors etc. but their customer service never bothered to answer any of my messages."
1,Temporary Use Only,"This product should be used only for temporary use, when someone is there to watch it. My first canopy was the victim of a sudden unexpected rain shower. The pitch on the roof is insufficient to let water run off, so the water pooled on one side, the canopy collapsed, and the struts were mangled. After repair with expensive replacement struts, a moderate wind picked the canopy up and smashed it against a neighbors fence. End of EZ UP canopies for me. The problem lies in the fact that the canopy material is impervious to water and acts like a kite in the wind.A much better product is the Koolaroo canopy available on the Internet. The material is woven and porous but still shades the sun. I left one up all summer in wind and rain with no problems. I would rate the EZ UP as unsatisfactory except for temporary use, and the Koolaroo as exceptionally good."
4,okay,i bought this for use when i had yard sales. while it was easy to put up~ which i had to used 3 people because the one wasn't much help~~ it wasn't as large as i thought that it was going to be i still had quite a bit of room. the only thing that i suggest is shower curtins. why you may ask is because it really didn't offer much rain and shade protection as i thought that it would. but buy some shower curtins and the rings and string them up before you put the canopy on the frame. that way you can tie them back during the day while people look at stuff~ if you are buying it for a yard sale~ and then you can use velcro to shut the curtins that evening so dew and rain don't ruin your stuff!!! but other than that it was a pretty nice product for the price
2,Flimsy Frame,"I bought this as a sun shade for my daughter's birthday party. It works for that purpose. However, you have to be very careful setting it up because the frame is very, very easy to bend. It's a two person job to get it up without bending supports. And hope it doesn't rain or blow very hard, because one good shower will destroy the frame. It was bent in half. It's not easy enough to put up and down every day, so it's really only good for single-shot use."
1,Flimsy piece of junk,"Buy the Sierra II 12x12 with an intent to throw it away. I've never seen such flimsy steel, such tedious legs. The claim that it's 12 ft by 12 ft is the kind of lie you can expect from corporate marketing. Maybe the feet of the legs,which stick out like the legs of an inebriated stork, are 12ft apart, but the covered area is less than 10 ft across. I was SO disappointed when I opened this thing at a crafts market. I'd gladly have paid $50 more for something that will last a while. Now i'm just hoping a strong breeze comes along and destroys the thing so I can get something better. What junk.I had a Canopy King for 10 years, and that's what I'll get next time."
4,alittle long,"a good read but alittle dragged out. i found myself skipping sections because it wasn't interesting. if you cut threw that, it was good.could have easily been a few pages shorter."
4,Great Read.,"I enjoyed this book. I would reccommend it to anyone interested in World War 2. While reading Mr. Taylor's story I was often tempted to shout, ""Wait! Don't do that!"", as the author described what his next plan was. It seems almost like a comedy of errors that Mr' Taylor stumbled through, though there was nothing comical about being in combat, being captured and certainly not about being tortured day after day with unimaginable pain derived from the most medival of techniques. The jump into Normandy, the capture, the POW camps, the escapes, recapture, the near-death torturing, the final escape, fighting along side the Russians. It's all here in great detail. If you think you will like this book-you will!"
5,bhl,This is a great book. this is a story about joe from the 101st airbourne. it shows his triumphs and let downs through world war two. from his first mission to his last. i am a junior in high school and am not that big of a reader. this was honestly the first book i couldnt put down. every page interested me more than i thought a book ever could. a very good bokk for someone my age or above. his intelligance and will to survive made this story one of the best.
3,Behind Hitler's Lines: The True Story of the Only Soldier to Fight for both America and the Soviet Union in World War II,"The story was truly incredible and would make for a great film. The flow of the book was a bit disjointed at times with the author's attempt to provide not only the base story about Joe Beyerle, but also to give context and timing of events of his story within the rest of the War. Overall, I thought it was a good read. Joe's story is very inspiring.From a Kindle standpoint, there were many errors in the text with repect to phrases being cut up and poor use of hyphening."
3,None,"Excellent content, very descriptive but very hard to follow. Book jumps around a lot, so take notes. i did not enjoy this as much as other memoirs about the 101st."
5,Paratrooper,Any story written or told by a paratrooper with links to the 101st or 82nd Divisions is a must. Excellent read. Trully remakable man.
2,Cross section does not fit.................,"The side rails work fine. But the center wires do not work at all. Trying to assemble a full size bed, hook in side rails are very hard to find, I thought I had found what I needed BUT the cross section (which you need) does not fit at all. Yes, there are several holes on each side supposedly so you can just match the wires to holes. It doesn't work. We had tried the wires in every hole provided and now we are about to drill correct holes in the side rails. WHAT A MESS. Don't buy unless you are prepared to drill correct holes or go out and buy wooden slats to take the place of the center wire. Would not reccomend."
5,Startingly Good!,"I heard this music on one of my city's classical music stations at Christmas. They had the original Sony recording as it turned out, but it's been re mastered and re released. Once that realization set in (by searching on Amazon) I ordered two copies, one for me and one as a gift. Both arrived after Christmas because of my late awakening, and ordering. Both I and my daughter still play this CD, long after Christmas -- it's that good! It's classically ""harp"" -- just as we non harpists think that instrument should sound! And the arrangements are all different and very interesting -- it's not just Christmas carols played on the harp -- but it is! <smile> Try it. You'll love it!"
1,WASTE,this actully hurts to stand on- and it does not stick to the tub. my son refused to sit on it. also it collects water and actully gets mold everywhere beacuse the water sits in the spaces.
5,So relieveing when in feet hurt,"This bath mat helps my feet so much. it feels so good when i take a shower after a day of aching feet...I run a warm shower and just rub my feet on it, it is so relaxing. it messages my feet so good while also getting them clean. I have also never once slipped while using this bath mat. it is sturdy...my bathtub floor is smooth and the suction cups just glue themselves to the bottom. yes, it is true hair does get caught in the bristles, but all you have to do is throw it in the washing machine that is the trick i use to get the hair out. works really good. so stop being lazy and just throw it in the washing machine. that is why it says, ""machine washable."" duh! take my word this is a great bath mat, just don't sit on it.....it was made for feet not butts. great product!"
3,Would have made more sense to have Star Trek I and II.,"My 3 stars is for this package and not for the movies themselves which I would rate at 5 stars. I would have preferred to get Star Trek I and II in the same box then II and IV (random). That would have been more ""logical"" to quote Spoke. :=) I'm having a hard time getting Star Trek I (The Motion Picture). It seems they are trying to cover up that one. The Wrath of Khan is my favorite, but you might as well purchase the individual bluray with all the bonus features for that."
3,For Trekkies;connects up the films.Not a masterpiece however.,Ok film and fun way to connect Wrath of Khan with the subsequent film to Search. However it is more an extended TV film and doesn't rank among the best Trek films.
1,Mastering? Hardly,"I could have written this material in my sleep.The screenshots are all in notepad with the php manual open in the background, so you can tell the author is looking things up. The monotone narrative voice will put you to sleep.Too many incorrect wordings/terminologies in what I heard to even point out here."
1,Hideous Waste of Time and Money,"First thing: I already know PHP pretty well. I picked this up because the price was right and because it IS titled ""Mastering PHP 5"". I had hoped it could help bridge some gaps in my knowledge of the new features specific to PHP 5, particularly the new OOP features, the new standard library stuff, etc.This thing is pathetic! It mostly consists of the monotonal narrator writing a tiny bit of code and showing it execute without explaining why things are as they are. It talked about data types in PHP as though booleans, integers, and strings are the only data types. The section on setting up PHP on windows discussed modifying only two lines in the php.ini file (register_globals and magic_quotes_gpc) without discussing why those modifications were happening.All in all this is truly horrible and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Not quite up to expectations,"These headphones don't quite produce the the bass quality I thought they would. Sound isn't great as compared to the more expensive models, but is ok for its cheap price. The headphones are also very flimsy. The plastic doesn't seem very durable to me."
3,"Lethargic, boring and frustrating performance","If you didn't know it, you'd swear the performers were already dead. This is limp and lifeless - a very boring and turgid interpretation of what should be a fiery and exciting piece (where is Colin Davis' fabulous performance???). The price might attract but the resuts are (pardon the expression) deadly."
3,NICE,IT IS OK. IF SOUND PRODUCTION IS INCLUDED IN THE TOY SMALL KIDS WILL ENJOY.JUST A TOY IS NOT A FUN TO KIDS.
3,A forgotten history of science,"Written in the style of the 'DaVinci Code' this history of forgetten science is quite fascinating. The title could definitely use the word 'history' in it. I certainly didn't expect a history lesson when I ordered the book.While the author obviously has a grasp of his subject, I personally find the science as he describes it very hard to comprend through his writing style. I think he should consider re-writing the book to allow laypeople to understand what the heck science he's writing about. What is a spiral field? How does and why does it turn?... in what directions?... give everyday examples... why do people think it turns? etc. etc. I certainly intend to re-read the book a number of times to see if I can understand what the heck he's talking about."
3,Finding Your Way Without Map or Compass,"it's ok I think it could use more color pages.if you want a good survival book get sas survival handbook by john ""lofty""wiseman"
2,Want to learn history?,"I've read many, many books about survival, orienteering, and finding your way w/out a map or compass. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Sure, every book will teach you something, no matter how poorly written it is. But you do not expect to read a book that is 95% history, and 5% orienteering. This book discusses all the ancient methods used by the messopotanians, and creesians and all the other eesians of the past. their methods worked for them, but dont work for us. AFTER you have read many other books about finding your way, you can consider reading this one to pick up a thing or too, or to brush up on your history. the book is written 60 years ago."
3,This is probably good for someone who really travels the world outdoors...,"...but I found it not particularly practical for what I had hoped it would be - finding one's way in North American forests, etc. The writer is clearly incredibly observant of the terrain, environment, and weather conditions in many places in the world, and is to be commended for his attention to detail, but I found the material on cloud formations over Pacific islands, prevailing winds in the Saraha desert or Antarctica, and the geographic organization of houses in medieval European cities to be of limited (if any) use. To be completely honest, I get more useful information from my subscription to Field and Stream magazine."
4,What a gem!,"This book is an absolute gem. I gave a copy of it to each of two friends for Christmas and both exclaimed how thrilled they were with it. One friend is a stargazer by nature and also loves to walk in the woods; the other prefers being in a boat far from shore. They couldn't believe such a wonderful and informative book existed. Thus, it's good thatthis formerly out-of-print book has been reprinted for a new generation's enjoyment."
2,Disappointing,Chapter on birds is superior. But the rest of the text summed up is stay in tunewith your surroundings.. natural environment. Natural history and natural sciencetrivial pursuit. Many examples are specific to either seaman or aviators and notpractical to land pursuit.
4,Recommended read for all adventurers.,This book combines historical data and personal experience for an informative read. It does belabor some of the points but I use it as a reference depending on the region I am exploring. It's a good go-to-reference and worth reviewing a particular segment before traveling or beginning an adventure. In a time when we are electronically dependent it does describe worthwhile skills in case your electronic device fails.
2,"Good potential, but poorly executed.","Concur with previous review. Example CRT programs don't work. The discussion of how to create console applications must be from Delphi 1, because it doesn't apply to Delphi 2. Fairly well written, but progresses very slowly. A better editing job would make this a good book. I think it's a cheap marketing ploy to put a great programming author's name (Tom Swan) on the book as ""series editor"". If Tom Swan had really participated in writing this book, the example programs would actually work."
2,Not well edited - several of the step-by-steps didn't work,"Mr Cogswell seems to know his topic, but the editors/testers did a terrible job checking out the step-by-step instructions and examples: the diskette install didn't work (I was able to figure out how to install it manually on W95, though). Another example was on page 425: steps 3-5 were a copy of steps 3-5 from page 420 - that was fine on page 420, but made no sense on page 425. There were several other examples of this type of poor proofing throughout the book"
4,Another great art book by Vigue,"Wow! What a fun book. A whirlwind trip through notable works by 75 of America's most notable artists. As with the others of his books, Vigue has presented the reader with an incredible collection of high quality images, art history, and commentary. Regretably, many fine images are too small to appreciate the fine details (playing card size images). The 25% larger format and somewhat narrower scope than his previous work1000 Masterpieces of Painting Nudesmight have enabled the images in this book to be printed 50-100% larger as he did withGreat Masters of Western Art. We can only wish that these excellent references would be reprinted in larger (letter size or coffee-table size format). Highly recommended for thoroughness of coverage, if not for size."
5,Desert Platues is fabulous,If your looking for a CD that will allow relaxation this one is great. John Huling has a natural talent for blending the sounds of nature with the sounds of man. His music is soothing and erotic at the same time.
5,WINDPROOF!,"I USED THIS MUSEUM WAX AT AN ART SHOW ON THE BOARDWALK AT VIRGINIA BEACH RECENTLY. MY HUSBAND IS A WOOD TURNER, AND NEEDED SOMETHING THAT WOULD HOLD HIS PIECES IN PLACE. WE HAD UNEXPECTED WIND GUSTS OF 30+MPH. WE DID NOT LOSE A SINGLE PIECE. IT WAS ALSO OVER 100* THAT SAME DAY. THE WAX HELD EVEN WITH THE STRONG WINDS AND THE EXTREME HEAT. THE WAX IS REMOVABLE AND REUSABLE, JUST LIKE ADVERTISED. IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF RUBBING WITH A CLOTH TO REMOVE THE EXCESS WAX FROM THE WOOD. BUT, IT DOES COME OFF AND IT DOES NOT LEAVE ANY MARKS OR DISCOLORATION ON THE WOOD. I LEARNED ABOUT THIS PRODUCT FROM ANOTHER ARTIST WHEN I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DISPLAY ANYTHING AT HOME BECAUSE OF MY CATS. HE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, AND I CAN SAFELY DISPLAY FRAGILE PIECES EVEN IN A HOUSE FULL OF CATS! IT IS A GREAT ITEM FOR THE PRICE!"
2,Not for Jewelry Photography,"While this may work great as a museum wax, I was directed to this item as a means of holding jewelry for photography. Once the wax is removed from the container, it becomes too soft and pliable."
5,Museum Wax,"This item arrived promptly and worked as advertised. We use it to hold items in the RV from moving around and becoming missiles. Works great - easy to use, and a little goes a long way!!"
1,Can't say I cared for this one,"I found the book self-serving, duplicitous and unkind. I think Ms. Montandon's work for peace is admirable and certainly deserves recognition. I am glad that she seems to have found peace, as that's surely something we all wish for. However, I thought her writing heavily tinged with unkindness and mean-spiritedness, particularly as regards Diane Wilsey. What Ms. Montandon had to say about Mrs. Wilsey is just plain untrue - delusional at best, and spiteful at worst. Mrs. Wilsey is generous, well-connected, a constant worker for the benefit of San Francisco, and was a caring and loving wife to Alfred Wilsey during their marriage. To say otherwise is untrue and unfair, and negatively affects the rest of the book - if one thing is untrue, it makes me question all of the rest. Her malice spoiled the book for me."
1,What is MAC listed with this software?,I bought it and it can only install on a PC 4.0 and 2.0 are listed with Mac PC and this is not true. That is why I gave it a low score. What am I missing with this software????
4,Enjoyable!,"I just re-read this book again, I love Madeline Baker's books. I read this book along time ago when it first came out. After reading other reviews about the book, I decided to re-read it and I did. I liked Caleb alot, I enjoyed the book in every way, except Callie, she was a little childish. Granted her mother was a whore, but that don't mean that you will be just like her. But anyway, the book was pretty good. I am still keeping the book so that in 5 years I can read it again."
3,I liked it.,"heather Garza from Phoenix, Arizona. The book u reviewed is called Love in the Wind also by Madeline Baker. I liked this book despite the fact the Callie is a brat through most of the book."
5,Fabulous!,"Who doesn't love the songs of Johnny Mercer? This version, played by the incomparable Beegie Adair, is one of my favourites to play in the car because it features such fabulous sing along songs such as Days of Wine and Roses; Something's Got to Give; Accentuate the Positive; That Old Black Magic and nine others which absolutely demand that you sing along with them, and, with such marvellous accompaniment, makes everyone sound like a star! I can personally guarantee that you won't be disappointed when you add this CD to your collection."
4,favorite,Can't get much better than Johnny Mercer tunes. And this CD compilation is excellent. Very enjoyable. Great for relaxing and dinner party background music.
5,A wonderful easy to listen to CD,"Days of Wine and Roses is an excellent beautiful CD by a very talented pianist and music by a fantastic song writer. It is music that our whole family can enjoy, without any bad selections at all."
5,Classics done well!,if you are a fan of Johnny Mercer or simply like smooth classics give this a listen. I'm a fan of Beegie and personally like this collection very much!
4,For piano lovers,"Beegie Adair's rendition of Johnny Mercers' music is wonderful. Very pleasant listening music for Jazz lovers and people who enjoy music, especially piano music."
3,Days fo wine and roses,I like the touch and temp of An Affair to Remember and I'll Take Romance better. I stll like the album.
3,Johnny Mercer??,"I enjoyed this CD too but Johnny Mercer? Mercer is a lyricist! As terrific a keyboard artist as Beegie Adair is, there's not a single lyric on the album.How can you title an instrumental album ""Days of Wine and Roses"" and include ""Moon River"" without mentioning Henry Mancini? Bizarre."
3,seems like more of a cover up,I have used many different products to try to combat my male cat's spraying. Of all the ones I have used I liked this one the least. It has a strong cover up scent that lingers and it seems to be the least effective at removing the smell of urine as well. I prefer the products that leave nothing behind (perfume or urine smells)
3,"Well-researched, but misses the point of Official English","The author has done a good job of researching the Official English movement in the states, and his analysis does discredit the claims by opponents of Official English that the movement is based on racism.However, his conclusion that the movement is based on nativism ignores the fact that many immigrants support making English official, and many supporters of Official English support immigration and believe that Official English will help immigrants in the long run"
4,For the Garand Man,"Every M1owner should have a copy! It's the Bible for the M1 Garand ! Get a copy while you can,not always easy to find."
3,Pretty and inexpensive,"It's pretty much what you see, a pretty charm that's inexpensive. It made my wife smile and it may my wallet smile...a win-win situation."
3,Nice and holds several little dogs,"I've used this stroller several times to carry two or three small Yorkies to outdoor events and still have room to hold my purse and a water bottle or two. I like the wagon style and that it doesn't look like a baby stroller. My dogs can see out well. The frame and fabric are well made and it's easy to set up and collapse.It does have a couple flaws. The handle is too short for comfort - and I'm only 5'3"". I ended up buying a baby stroller extension handle for it. Also, I have trouble with the carrier not staying attached to the frame. It's designed so you can use the carrier separately, which I've never used, but it could use a better design to keep it in place when you're pushing the stroller."
4,"Scary, twisty gems from Rod Serling.","""The Dummy"" is about a ventriloquist who honestly believes that his dummy is alive (though he drinks a lot) and soon gets taken over in way reminiscent of DEAD OF NIGHT (1945). ""The Lateness of the Hour"" is a bizarre yet original tale of robots as an elderly gentlemen's personal assistants. The first episode is chilling, the second is strange, both are memorable (especially ""The Lateness of the Hour,"" though, since it has the surrealistic visual style also found in ""Long Distance Call"")."
5,Ah - that Scottish accent,"I love this show but, as others have said, sometimes it is very difficult to understand through the heavy accent. For instance, at the end of Dead Ringer, there is a baby screaming and I still don't know what was said. I have listened several times and can't get it. If anyone knows, I would love to hear from them. Still love the show though!"
3,Marred by low production value,"I've no complaint with the acting or writing, or even the accents. But the production value is intrusively low. Thees episodes were filmed nearly 30 years ago, and it shows. Specifically, the exterior settings are fine, but the interior sets reminded me of those of many Monte Python skits. Python's intentionally stagy sets worked well with Python's zaniness, but here unintentionally stagy sets work against the goal of the production, which is to pull you into the story's reality. I intend to jump to the later sets in the series before abandoning it altogether."
4,Union Sq Cafe cookbook,The book was a gift and the recipient enjoyed it very much. After eating at the restaurant it was to good try out the great recipes.I would recommend it.
4,Union Square Cafe just as I'd hoped!,"Great book with easy to follow instructions.... a damn shame there is not as many pictures of the food, but really happy!"
1,cookbook,This book was very disappointing becos it had very few illustrations which for me are a MUST in cookery books. But the Amazon service was excellent as always.
3,Satisfied,The item was received within the stated delivery schedule stated. I'm very satified with this order
4,"Superb flavors, excellent results --- good variety","While nothing can match dining at the restaurant, the recipes feature some of the best of USC's repetoire and, they are easy to follow (or even improvise from!). These are items you will fix for guests or yourself and also on holidays"
2,Not the Stevie I hoped for.,"Stevie is a phenomenal artist, no doubt about that, but this Christmas album totally bored me. The musical compositions do not match the massiveness of his voice. Would have loved to hear a bit more funk/soul in the album, that would have been the perfect 'Stevie touch.'"
5,Stevie Wonder Christmas,"This is another one of those CDs that I owned years ago, but don't know what happened to it. The songs are timeless, and it was fun listening to them again."
4,Ave Maria - with a harmonica solo,"Stevie recorded these songs in the 60s when he was a teenager. This CD features the 12 songs originally released along with two bonus tracks from the vaults, per Motown's marketing strategy. Three of the songs heard on the radio over the years are Someday at Christmas, What Christmas Means To Me and One Little Christmas Tree. The two bonus tracks are The Miracles of Christmas and Everyone's a Kid at Christmastime. The latter one is a bit upbeat and I like it better than the former. Familiar tunes like Silver Bells, The Christmas Song and The Little Drummer Boy are featured. The rest is mostly original material, though Twinkle Twinkle Little Me was first heard on the Supremes Christmas album.Amazingly, Motown never had Stevie do a Christmas album as an adult when his music career was thriving in the 70s and 80s. But this selection of songs still holds up. Only Stevie could do Ave Maria with a harmonica solo and make it sound so good."
5,Heart whispered teachings,"This little book is like having an old dear friend put their arms around you to draw you close and whisper in your ear ""I know your heart"". Absolutely relevant to our time and place, Longchenpa's work is written with you in mind."
5,A profound work!,"Reading the text one can definitely get a lot of insights into the deepest teaching of the planet(if not the universe)... Prejudice apart, the book IS a real thing taught by eminent Lonchenpa and translated into English with a high degree of precision. Thumbs up!"
3,"Es un libro ""ok""..","El libro contiene buena informacion.. un final muy bonito e inspirador. Bueno para comenzar en los estudios de la wicca.No se compara con el libro de Raymond Buckland que se titula ""Wicca"", pero es bueno.Lo unico que no me agrado, es la gran influencia de Santeria, que la autora posee. En un comentario me parece que habla de venganza.. lo que contradice el lema y ley principal de la Wicca que cita: ""Has lo que quieras, mientras no hagas daño"". A mi entender, la Wicca trata de elevar el espiritu a un estado de paz, y de donde vengo, Paz y Venganza no son sinonimos. Pero quitando ese comentario, el libro es un buen libro."
2,"Not bad, Not good","Sound is ok, not great. Headband too small & uncomfortable to fit over my head. Pads are nasty, they could of come up with something better. Mid & low sound ok, highs are non-existant. Would not recommend these headphones to anyone."
2,"Great sound, until they broke",Purchased on 7/31/12 and the cord closest to the headphone jack broke on 12/19/12. Obviously the quality is questionable. Amazon's return policy won't let me return them either. Pretty poor experience.The one positive thing is that the sound was great for the price while the headphones lasted.
2,A small but important detail...,There's nothing wrong with these headphones. They're fine. However the foam covers lasted only a few months and I can't find any replacements anywhere. The headphones are therefore uncomfortable to wear and I'm in the process of replacing these headphones with something more robust.
2,Koss SportaPro,Really good bass. Good overall sound and clarity. These are far and away the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE headphones I have ever tried on or worn in my life. The Metal band is like torture. I gave them away and they came back like a bad penny!!
2,"great sound, bad design","these headphones have great bass and sound quality. . .but bad quality of design. after several weeks, the earphones kept coming off the headband and i've been using tape to secure it in place now. i didn't drop them or throw them around, this just happened from normal wear and taking it in and out of the soft carrying case. plus the cord covering isn't durable since i already have a few nicks and areas where the wires are exposed. if you plan to put your headphones thru alot of use, don't get these."
4,"Very nice, however...","I bought these phones for my MP3 player (iPod) and haven't been disappointed. They sound great, the bass is full and rich and the high end has surprising clarity. They do an excellant job of masking environmental noise and are quite comfortable. A feature I most looked forward to was the kill switch that was described in the write-up and appears in the picture. My problem is that the phones I received, although the same model number and identical in all respects to the described product, had NO SWITCH. This [is bad] but the sound quality and price value of these phones make them too good to return. I give them 4 stars, they'd get a five if I had my switch. Hopefully the description will be fixed to present a more accurate representation of the product."
5,Great sound and very comfortable,Bought these because my Sonys could not handle the music range I listen to. I researched headphones extensively and settled with these. Im into hard rock through to classical. I enjoy letting people listen to them. I then enjoy seeing them gasp when I tell them how much I paid. I then struggle to get them back from them! All in all an ideal travel companion. Koss has my total respect.
3,Koss SportaPro headphones,"I'm no audiophile by any means, and I'm not too impressed with these headphones. I bought them to listen to mp3s at work and to listen to music, watch dvds and play games on my computer at night without making noise to wake my roomate. When you turn up the volume it sounds scratchy, it's annoying enough to make me turn it down. Consequently i can't listen as loud as I would like."
1,Terrible,"I know a lot of people have reviewed and liked this product. Perhaps it works for them, but I hate it. This set of headphones is already in the garbage. Why? The sound quality is not nearly as good as the reviews led me to believe it would be. I have other headphones with much better sound, but that is not the primary reason that I dumped them. The wire placement for the headphones is in an uncomfortable place - in front of the ear-coverings, so the wires are over my cheeks as they drop down to my ipod. I would rather have the wires toward the back and out of the way. Also, I like to drop the wires down the back of my shirt to get them out of the way and hook my ipod onto my belt. The wires on these headphones are too short for this, and with the wire-placement, the wires cut across my neck when I tried wearing them this way. I have purchased two Koss products. I've been disappointed with both. There will not be a third."
1,Plug broke after 3 months,"These headphones sound great, but after 3 months of normal use the plug broke and they no longer function. And since it is past the return window I cannot get a refund or have them replaced. I'm pretty sure it was a manufacturer defect as I have never had a pair of headphones break in this way from normal use."
5,Comfortable and Sound Fine,I use these with my MP3 player to listen mostly to audio books and podcasts. They stay on and are comfortable with a good length for the cord. Time will tell if they become my favorite headsets.
4,Excelent sound for bass-likers. Word of advice for bike riders.,"This pair of headphones have an excelent sound for those who like bass, just like much of the other reviewers have already said. I bought them because they can be used as neck-band, thinking I could use them while bicycle riding, but it turns out that only the headband turns, while the cushions remain upside the ears. That way, they still cannot be used in a comfortable manner with a bike helmet. I tried some other ways of using them, but they are not really comfortable. Summarizing, great sound and very comfortable. I totally recommend these unless you plan to use them for bike riding."
2,Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones,"I reviewed many sources before I purchased the Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones but the headphones are over rated. They are uncomfortable and sound quality is nothing spectacular. The metal band that surrounds your neck, to provide the sport set-up, never performed in a satisfactory manner. Find another product to purchase if you are looking for a comfortable headphones with better sound."
5,Greatest workout headphones I have bought,"I have used an MP3 player with headphones for my workouts for several years now. I cannot use ear bud types because they just fall out when I move. I don't want to buy expensive over the ear headphones just to sweat all over them but quality inexpensive over the ear headphones seemed impossible to find. The Koss SportaPro is the best choice I have made yet at under 30 dollars. They sound great and the band style along with the pivoting ear pieces keeps them in place. The band pivots for the behind-the-head or over-the-head style. I find the behind-the-head to be a little awkward, probably because I am not used to it, but they do stay in place, which is great for push-ups. I have read that some find them to be ugly but I could care less what they look like and frankly cannot understand that criticism. I highly recommend these headphones for anyone that needs headphones while exercising or any activity."
3,"stiff and ugly, but great sound","On the plus side, these have great, rich sound. They also grip the head well so they work for exercise. On the negative side: They are seriously fugly...like people will look at you funny ugly. Also the 'strap' that goes around the back is NOT a strap. It's steel. The length is adjustable (though it can pull hair when you adjust), but it is rigid and doesn't really work in the ""around the back"" position (in the picture). So I ended up wearing it in the ""over the top of the head"" position which worked fine but it's not what I wanted. If you don't care how they look at all and you want seriously good sound, these are a good buy. Otherwise I'd recommend you keep looking...I am..."
4,great headphones; worth the price,"for 23 dollars, these headphones provide the sound quality of a $200 pair of headphones. absolutely amazing bass and tonal quality, great for relaxing. the only downsides are that they look really weird and they can get uncomfortable depending on how you wear them.overall, i highly recommend them for anyone who is looking for a good deal."
3,Sounds pretty good...,But not quite as good as I'd hoped. They could be a bit uncomfortable for some. I liked the storage pouch that came with them.
2,"Could be better, much better","Well today my regular headphones broke (Seinheiser HD-457) so I had to go out and get a new pair. I have heard many good things and stellar reviews about the Koss Portapro and Sportapro headphones. In the store I had trouble finding anything that I could afford (...) and finally came across the Koss Sporta Pro. For [the price], and all the good reviews I have heard, and the fact they are lighter and fold up, I decided to buy them.First I tried them with my minidisc player and they sounded pretty decent. They also sounded fairly decent with my cassette player as well. But when I listened later this evening on the noisy bus I could barely hear my music over the groan of the engine. To make matters worse, with the increased volume there was terrible distortion. The bass was excessive and the high frequences made this awful ""fluttering"" effect.Nonetheless they are back in their package and will be returned to the store tomorrow."
2,DON'T BUY THIS ...,They collapse but what the heck? How on earth are you supposed to jog with these things when you wear it behind your head? The fit is EXTREMELY and SEVERELY awkward. They sound good but there must be a better headphone that won't give you so much trouble putting it on. Did I mention your hair can get entangled or even yanked? I've got some bald spots to prove it. Mark my words: this is a ... Don't buy it. I should have bought ...
5,Great Headphones,"These replaced MDR-A35 headphones, which just did not have any punch unless eq-ed. These headphones do great with my new phone based MP3 player that unfortunately does not have eq. These headphones seem to have a great compromise of small size and great sound. Much better than any ear buds or sports headphones I've tried. Seem well built for the low budget price."
5,High quality product,"I recently purchased a pair of these headphones and found the quality to be top notch. They sound excellent and can handle pretty high levels of bass without distorting it. I have had two pairs of Sony heaphones and one pair of Aiwas(which are trash.) I was truly surprised at the comfort of these headphones, especially in the behind the head positon. The fold-up function is nice and the leather bag is an added bonus. Also included is a gold plug that allows you to use these headphones with larger jack systems(such as home theaters.) Overall, these headphones produce high sound quality without the size and weight of other models."
3,"Sound is awesome, but fit is awkward","I got a pair of these to replace the hphones that came w/ my MP3 player. I was not expecting a super audio performance out of hphones, especilaly listening to a portable MP3 source. However, the sound quality blew me away. The bass response is tremendous, and there's absolutely no reason to increase the bass boost on the player. It's an awesome little product.The only downside is the design - in trying to retrofit the Portapro to an updated ""behind the head"" fit, the Sportapros are a bit cumbersome to wear. It's best to wear them in a traditional over the head fashion."
2,"Decent sound, painful fit","I purchased these headphones based on their rating (around 4.5) stars, and while the sound quality has been okay, the headphones are tight and designed in a way that they *can't* be adjusted to fit properly. I wear these headphones at work and at the gym for durations of over an hour. These headphones will hurt after being worn for around a half hour as they start to dig into your ears. They are not comfortable, and they're pretty ... flimsy looking. The cloth around the ear piece also acts like a sponge if you sweat when you work out. Bottom Line: I *HIGHLY* (can't stress this enough) suggest trying these on before you purchase them!"
4,Big Head People Beware,"I love these headphones in behind the head mode (especially now that I know the earpieces can rotate). In over-the-head mode I find the band a little tight. It works, but the earphones barely cover my ears. I have a large head, and doubt most people will have any discomfort using this in over-the-head mode. But I'll likely be using it in behind the head mode even when I'm not outside wearing a hat, just because it's more comfortable."
3,"Good, but not quite what I expected.","The speed of the shipment was great. I received the product today in great condition, but it was not what I expected to receive. I have a full size version of this bunny, and I was trying to purchase a duplicate of it for my nephew. According to the image on this listing I was certain I was buying the same thing, even still the picture looks identical to the big bunny I have and slightly less similar to the smaller bunny I received. While the product is not what I expected, the price was good, as was the service and shipping.I was definitely satisfied with the seller, just a little bit disappointed in the product."
3,NOT AS CUTE AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.,"I'M A BUNNY FREAK AND I COLLECT LOTS OF BUNNIES. BUT, SOMEHOW I WAS A LITTLE DISSAPOINTED IN THIS ITEM, I CAN'T REALLY SAY WHY."
2,Not as good as I expected,I got this for my 5 yr old Shih-Tzu that has many allergies. I thought it would help to flush his eyes at least once a day but I've noticed that this doesn't help him much. It actually makes his eyes watery even after I clean up his face. Once I stopped flushing his eyes out they went back to normal. Maybe it is just the severity of his allergies but I am choosing not to use this on him going forward. The price is comparable to the stores.
5,Eye wash for Cats,I used Opticlear for my cat that had pink eye. It is inexpensive and works well to wash out debris and allergens from the eye. It is easy to control the stream with a little pressure on the bottle. Good product - no hesitation to use it again.
4,Reminds me of Joni Mitchell...,"Some of Kathryn Priestley's harmonies remind me of early Joni Mitchell, but with fresh music. She's got a great voice. So where's she been?"
2,Not quite there yet,"This will be a great ladder a couple revisions from now. I have an issue with the link arms hitting one of the screws in the frame, but Werner is sending me a kit to install redesigned link arms. Good for them, having that on hand. There is another issue in that because of the way my ceiling is (which I don't think is too unusual), the ladder frame doesn't meet up with the ceiling - it is installed a couple of inches above the ceiling, thus leaving a gap that I still have to figure out how to fill. Also, when compressing the gas struts during installation, their gear mechanism slipped off of the teeth so badly that it took probably 20 tries to get the struts fully compressed.I spoke with Werner and they indicated that this is a new product for them and as a result they are continually improving the quality. They have a new version coming out in a couple of months that will address some of the aforementioned issues."
4,werner s2208 attic ladder,"After reading the previous reviews on this unit I must admit, I was skeptical, but after owning 3 other Warner ladders with no problems I thought I'd give it a try. I opted to use a 12""adjustable wrench instead of the supplied wrench for compressingthe struts. This worked very well. Had two of the lag bolts snap-off during installation of the frame which I replaced. Read and follow directions carefully. This unit is a huge improvement from my old wooden attic ladder. Works great."
1,Werner S2208 Junk,"I bought this ladder 3 or 4 years ago and use it at Christmas Time and in the spring so it has less than 15 uses. Used it last weekend and when I folded it back up I found the locking hinged had broke. It's advertised as a steel ladder, but the hinges are pot metal. I called werner and asked about purchasing a replacement hinge and was told I need to replace the ladder. The also said if it was the lower hing that had broke, ( the ladder is three sections), they would replace that for free. I don't understand their logic here, but I would suggest buying something else if your are looking for durability."
1,Beware!!!!!,"There are MANY accounts of these Werner S2200 line of steel ladders breaking at the hinges (with little use). Mainly for the S2210, but I have also seen a similar breakage report for the S2208. These models have now been discontinued. Google Werner s2210 broke and you will see what I mean. Caution!"
1,Limited,"It's disappointing to spend money on software and later come to realize it has the same suite of features as does many free image-editing websites. Yes, PhotoImpression can rotate a picture. The latest feature? It can remove red-eye! (Again, common features you can find for free on any image-editing website). My OS also had some quirks after installation. After uninstalling PhotoImpression, the quirks went away. I decided to pawn off the software but eventually had to give it away.I bought this product because it had a reputation of being a ""poor man's"" PhotoShop that nevertheless came with a robust suite of features. Believe me, you're far better off spending a little more and getting what you really want--a robust application with a complete set of features. It'll save you time, money (and your OS) in the future."
5,Well designed and fun photo software,"This is a great program for home use. I have tried Adobe Elements and PhotoImpact Pro 8.5and found Arcsoft PhotoImpression 5 far superior in both ease of use and features. Editing is limited but adequate for most homeusers. If you also buy Arcsoft PhotoStudio, it adds all the editing features offered by Adobe Elements and PhotoImpact Pro. Ease of use and fun features, such as great clip art and a well organized photo album, make it the best home photo software I have used. Arcsoft also offers additional software, such as funhouse, which are great add ons."
2,If you're a big enough fan of Jackie Chan that you want to see everything he was ever in...,"...well, here you go. I spent $7 on this at Fry's and I'm glad I didn't spend more. Chan, like most actors, worked his way up, and these movies show some of the journey. They are not lost gems... they're just not even really great films. I even have been unable to find one of them in his credits at the IMDB. But he's in them... somewhere. For the amount I paid, it isn't so bad. But I should have had better sense. I was expecting them to be lesser quality, but somehow I didn't expect him to barely be in them. I thought that was rather sneaky... and it was... but I admit, on inspection, the box never says anything more than that it has 4 feature length films and Jackie Chan is in them. Well, okay, then."
2,Bad buy,I don't really like these movies because Jackie Chan wasn't really in many scenes of these movies. Don't buy it!
3,Humor,"I bought it at Wall-mart for $5. The main reason I wanted it was for the action, but it did not have that much action in it. If you like old humor then it's actually pretty good. In my opinion it is worth about $5-$10."
5,"nice addition to the ""sleeping on roads"" album.","Very fond of Neil Halstead's songs, I,too, find ""sailorman"" one of his great songs. Simple, mellow, with fancy guitar picking ( I love the guitar, perfect choice of notes and chords) on top of an organ. Beautiful melody, touching voice, good lyrics, a pleasure.The alternate version of ""see you on rooftops"", which presents this nice song in a different light, is exellent ( as is the original).These two, for me made the EP worthwile, the rest is bonus ;I do like ""season"" surf style, the other two are interesting ( one is a lo-tech solo live version of ""between the bars"" which was included later in mojave3 ""spoon and rafter"")."
1,This was awful,"I brought this dvd and being a fan of Usher's it was completely useless. The quality of the DVD was poor, and i would of used my money on the Rhythm City DVD rather than this one. SORRY. DONT BUY!"
4,"Well done, but unrefined.","Anthony Newman's harpsichord playing is technically flawless(probably edited) and the recording quality is excellent, but Newman's playing tends towards the dry side. His articulation is always either legato or staccato, and thus very pianistic. He refuses to take advantage of one of the most important harpsichord techniques: creating the illusion of loud and soft through varying degrees of short and long notes.However, the triple manual harpsichord by Keith Hill has a very grand sound which is exciting to hear."
5,Excellent!!!,"I waited for this book to come out for what seemed like FOREVER, and when it did I was not disappointed. Wild Rain is one of those books that keeps you on edge until the very end. In Wild Rain both the hero and heroine are hunted by enemies and haunted by their pasts. They meet in a clash of wills and love with the same blazing fervor. I really love how suspenseful Christine Feehan made this book. There were times when I got really annoyed when the heroine wouldn't speak about her past, and then there were times when the hero's attitude really got on my nerves. There was a bit of blood and gore in this book that definitely made me cringe at times, but didn't take away from the love story. Wild Rain was a wonderful book, and another smash hit of Christine Feehan's! I loved it!"
5,Feeham has reinvented herself!,"This book was an exciting adventure to read! Feehan has completely seperated her writing style from any she has done before and succeeded in doing so! I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading books with a prenaturnal edge. I eagerly anticipate additions to the Leopard series. If you decide to read this book you'll also want to read her novella, The Awakening, in the anthology, Fantasy. That is where the Leopard series is born . I just can't express how great this book is. You will not regret picking it up. The story of Rachelle and Rio in the rain forest is enchanting. You will, no doubt, love it too!"
4,Better than the Dark Series,"I am a huge fan of vampire books which is why I started reading CF at all - and why I continued even after the most horribe of the series (Darck Magic). The most recent of her books - Dark Melody, Shadow Game and now Wild Rain are some of her best. Her characters have matured and are much more developed.Wild Rain gives a romantic look at the rain forest as well as a cool idea of shape shifters that have both animal and human instincts (it could have been more explored but she's usually more interested in her character's relationship and how the *weird* aspect effects their relationship or world). The plot of Rachel's past was somewhat over the top - but hey - it fit. Rio had enough sensitivity and toughness to make him an appealing leading man and Rachel wasn't just a hysterical or voiceless twit. The secondary characters were equally enjoyable and hopefully if the idea continues into a series - Elijah gets his own book."
2,Christine Feehan Fan,I have always looked forward to a Christine Feehan book. Wild Rain is a little different from her Carpathian books but so were some of her other works that I have read. The book was missing Feehans fire. It took me a week to get through this book. Normally I read a book written by Feehan in a day.Perhaps others would like the book but I am a disappointed fan.
2,Too much sex,"The basic storyline is interesting, but clouded by too much sex. I wanted more character development not just how great they looked, how much trouble they had keeping their hands off each other. Won't read her stuff again."
4,Tarzan + Cat People = Wild Read.,"Even though Rachael had faked her death and changed her name, the killers following her are determined. Even slipping into the rain forests of Indochina have not shaken there dogged pursuit. Exhausted, she stumbles upon a house and decides to rest. When Rio returns home, he believes that a killer is hiding there and he attacks. Quickly the mistaken identity is revealed and Rio is battling to save Rachael's life. While I am an indoors kind of person, I enjoyed the enchanted rain forest in which this story unfolds. Recommended."
1,Disappointed Texas Reader,"Let me say right off the bat I am a big Christine Feehan fan. I was so excited that a new book was coming out and got Wild Rain the day it was released.This is not Christine's finest moment as a writer. Usually in a Feehan book the tension and rapport of the main characters drives the action. I felt that Rachel and Rio had no rapport in their relationship, and I was not engaged by their characters, situation, or dialogue. I could have cared less what happened to them, and I had to make myself finish the book. That's the first time that's ever happened to me with a Feehan novel.If you have not read Christine Feehan before, do not judge her by this latest effort. Start with ""Dark Prince"", and work your way up to ""Dark Guardian"", which is my personal favorite of the Carpathian series. I also thought that ""Shadow Game"" was an imaginative and engrossing book, and that her concept of the Ghostwalkers was both innovative and entertaining."
2,Not up to par,"If you are a fan of Christine for her brilliant dark series you will be disappointed in this book. Parts of it feel like national geograpic, parts of it are too slow, and in general the story and the characters just aren't as evolved as her Carpathian books. I hate to say it about an auther I love so much, but I don't find this series worth reading at all. However if you are looking for a good read, check out any of her dark books. They are AWESOME."
1,Derivative Trash,"This is just a horrible book. The characters are flat, the writing is unimaginative, and the subject is trite."
2,A Disappointment,"I read this book at the local library because I had been recommended it from reading Mary Janice Davidson and the like. I found the plot slow, and the emotions very unjustified. It seemed silly most of the time, and I couldn't get over how they would give each other such ""noble"" qualities without actually showing them. Rachel was crying most of the time, even though Rio described her as ""brave"", and Rio was supposed to be all ""hard-hearted""...hardly. However, since this book was said to be a ""super-natural"" romance by some; I read it. I gave it 2 stars because I felt that it did hold more water than most romance fluff, but it didn't hold the plot standards to make it interesting enough or exciting enough to be good. If you are just interested in a cheesy romance, go ahead and read it. But if you want a good supernatural romance, I suggest you read the UNDEAD series by Mary Janice Davidson and the SOUTHERN VAMPIRE SERIES by Charlaine Harris. Thanks."
4,Good Read,"I found ""Wild Rain"" to be a good read. It was a hard switch, going from Vampires to the Leopards, but an enjoyable one. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys tales of shape-shifters and other mythical creatures."
4,Hunted and Hunter,"The mysterious Rachel captures my attention. However, The animal instincts of Rio holds me. Who is she? What is she hiding? Who is hunting her and why? They questions unfold about Rachel. Rio the loner leopard is attacked by a visitor(Rachel) in his own home. His cats attack Rachel leaving her vulnerable to infection and Rio's care. Rio has secrets of his own. Rio's honor and code reaches out to the hunted Rachel. Feehan reveals the beauty and dangers of the jungle. Rio and Rachel embrace their sensuality and revel in their passion. The brother sister relationship feels real and loving. The friendship, loyalty, honor, and responsibility between Drake, Joshua and Rio is 'to die for.' The ablity to acknowledge 'mistakes are possible' and 'people can change' leads to acceptance. The only reason I'm not 100% thrilled is that it doesn't equal the hungry passion of ""Burning Wild."""
4,Loved This Book,"I was getting a little tired of the Carpathians and have loved the Ghost Walker series. I ran across this book by accident, picked it up and started reading it and loved it! I found it hard to put it down. I kept waiting for Rachael's first shift. Actually it was sort of anticlimatic, but interesting. I think there are more in this series and I will be looking for the rest. I couldn't find anything not to like about this book."
2,Don't watse your time or money,"I don't normally write reviews but I had to make an exception this time... I was so disappointed with this book. It bored me from start to finish so much so that I had to force myself to finish it. The main characters had no real chemistry only a connection through past lives. Mid way through the book I kept thinking I got it they had a past connection you don't have to keep ramming it down my throat. The main character Rachel annoyed me because she seemed so one dimensional. The hero Rio didn't really make me want to do anything but feel sorry for him. The story seemed stilted and forced as if the author ran out of ideas so she kept repeating the same things over and over again ... Rachel has a secret, she doesn't know she's a shifter , she can't trust anyone and she loves Rio but can't trust him and she can't talk to him about her secret.... and oh yeah they were together in a past life.Bottom line don't buy this book, borrow it"
1,Deceptive product description,In every description of this item it stated that it is a 10ft X 10ft shelter. After I received mine I discovered that the actual size of the awning was less than 8ft X 8ft. I am returning mine to anazon.com. WHY CAN'T THESE COMPANIES BE HONEST ABOUT THE ITEMS THAT THEY ARE SELLING????
2,nothing easy about it,"Once this shelter was up and staked, it held through 20 mile an hour winds. However, getting it up and down required three people and pushing the buttons in at the top corners to lock and unlock the frame in place was nearly impossible. I had to resort to using my keys which then pushed two of them in so far that they are now stuck!"
1,Maps don't match text!,"If you're unfamiliar with the Access Guide series, the text and maps are keyed to each other by numbers. However, the maps printed in our copy of the 4th edition are unchanged from our copy of the 3rd edition, while the numbers in the text have changed as entries were added and deleted. As a consequence, the numbers on the maps often bear no relation to the numbers in the text, making the book less useful. Try to find the third edition -- not that much changed in the fourth edition -- or wait a few years for the fifth edition. It's a shame, the Access Guides are generally among the most useful for the casual tourist. Don't try looking at the URL given on the back cover of the 4th edition for corrections -- that web site has no content. E-mail to the publisher has not elicited an acknowledgement of the problem after ten days."
1,Come to Philly but not with this one.,Incredibly inaccurate. Flashmaps: where are you when we need you?
3,This is a decent companion.,"This book has reviews of the concepts in chapter, mathematical help and some guide to solving some of the problems in each chapter. If you think you are not really understanding the material, this book is somewhat useful. It might be more useful to get help from a tutor or a t.a. The student solution guide that wiley also offers was more helpful for me in understanding how to do a lot of the problems."
3,brings back memories,"This album is exactly what I remember from my youth. It brought back memories. It is irreverant and profane, but so was life back then."
5,"Youth, love, passion and dispair","One of the best book of poems ever written. The best, obviously is to read it in spanish, but in english the soul of the poet comes easily through as well. Poem number 20 is to me the best. But they are all great and unforgetable.I read them first 30 years ago and they have travel with me since then, sometímes in my suitcase, but always in my mind."
3,Beautiful imagery but less mature than later works,"This is a book of fantastic love poems full of erotic but not explicit imagery. His later poems show much more understanding of love and relationships. They are also much more accessible. I would not have missed reading these poems, however."
4,Neruda poems,"While I wanted to come to know the poetry of Neruda and the recognition he received during his life, I found them syrupy and sophomoric. I did appreciate their being side-by-side, English and Spanish so I was able to practice my Spanish translation.Maybe it's because I am much older and the more current poetry, more edgy."
3,"Neruda, but not Much","Although this volume is Neruda at his best, especially in his romantic mode, the book is VERY thin. Still, it's Neruda and wonderful and in some ways it's a treasure because it is small."
2,weak neruda,"Now I like Neruda. I think he is an important poet, and I fully expected to love this collection. But as I read it I found that I didn't really like any of the poems. There were a few that were almost passable, but only a couple. I don't know if it was Merwin's translation, Neruda's writing, or just me not connecting with the poetry. I say read Neruda, just not this collection."
5,the most romantic book of love poems ever written,"perhaps this is the most romantic and most beautiful book of love poems ever written. every word, every stanza is so easily read, so quickly understood, like an arrow to the heard. give this gift to your lover and they will never forget it."
1,Tv pretty blurry,"I found this TV to be way too much, the picture in picture musy run through a VCR, and the actuall picture it's self I found to be very blurry. However the sound quality from this TV is unbeatable"
3,It's okay...,"This product is okay. I purchased it for a trip to Europe & haven't had a chance to try it there yet. I've been using it here to see how it will handle. I had a hard time finding a diffuser to fit it & the one I finally bought, Conair Pro Universal, fits but pops off during drying. Also, even though it is labeled for 1900 watts, it feels a lot cooler than my 1875 watt dryer I currently have. I hope I am not disappointed when I go on my trip & use the Euro setting."
5,Excellent dryer,"I've used this hair dryer for years. It's a very reliable, long lasting dryer. I especially like the removable screen and cold button."
4,Well Worth The Money,"This book is an excellent value for the money. The photography is outstanding. It is printed in Italy - so the quality is very high. One of the reviewers complained about the writing. It's translated from Italian! If you aren't an art professor, you probably won't even notice! Also, this book is probably the best book on the subject, at a very fair price. So, unless you are able to pay $200 for Rizzoli's out of print, ""Venetian Palaces"" - get this book! It's far cheaper than a trip to Italy!"
1,Club Music for Dummies,"This is probably the worst dance album I have ever had the misfortune of listening to. If you like real dance club music (e.g. Seb Fontaine Prototype, Global Underground), as opposed to speeded up townie pisshead dance, then stay well clear of this c**p."
3,TI 89 Calculator,Thank you for sending me a great calculator. It was in great shape as i received the item and i am very happy that i now have a TI89 calculator for my calculus class.
1,Discontinued model,"The TI-89 was discontinued several years ago. It has been replaced by the TI-89 Titanium, which is an improved model with more memory, etc. Even so, when new, one would have to be insane to pay this price."
5,Amazing!,Today I met the man that wrote Blind Sight. I was able to tell him how exciting his novel is!! Can hardly wait to read Terror by NIght.It shows that life... these are true stories... can be stranger than fiction. Our Lord makes no mistakes!
5,Begging for a Sequel,"I thorughly enjoyed this very moving book.The author did a great job interweaving various experiences and characters and left me hanging so I couldn't put it down. It is full of suspense, action, drama and has a spiritual punch. The verses in Habakkuk are well chosen and an encouragement to anyone who can't see God in the picture.It is full of true information regarding cults and this one in particular (within the story of the book) that really went wild.I love the formatting of the book and think it is a masterpiece from cover to cover. It is begging for a sequel."
4,"Lots of info, maybe a little hard to get into","I bought this book locally because, the last time I checked Amazon, it was on a 1-2 months wait here- big mistake because The Complete Slayer is now available in a reasonable time at a good price.I've just started reading it and find that just about everything seems to be covered, even the original movie starring Kristy Swanson. You'll find original US & UK broadcast dates, episode cast lists,music, descriptions and quotes for each episode as well as a lot of interesting trivia bits. That last part surprised me because this isn't even Topping's Slayer trivia book. The man obviously loved the show, there's so much here (I guess he got it right, I do remember a little item or two that aren't mentioned in this book)the problem is that, at 702 pages, it may be a little hard to get into for a casual reader."
5,Coffee on the go!,"Tastes like any other gum, but kicks like a cup of coffee. Best of all, you can take it with you anywhere, don't have to keep it warm, and it won't spill and stain your shirt!"
5,fantastic product,"Falling asleep in class? Staying up late for that end of the year project? Coffee machine broken or too expensive? Jolt energy gum gives you energy quickly, with a great taste and at a great price. You can't always drink coffee, but you can always have a piece of gum. I'd recommend this product to anyone and everyone. I gave out packs of this to a lot of my friends at the end of last semester before finals."
4,Great for when it's inconvenient to have coffee!,"I do a lot of driving for my work, and a lot of visiting other businesses. I also drive a manual transmission, sometimes in heavy traffic. It's not always the greatest idea to be driving in heavy traffic with one hand on the wheel, one on a cup of coffee, and needing to shift, or to be wandering around in a clients place of business.Jolt gum tastes pretty much like any other minty gum (there is a bit of a difference, but it is not unpleasant), but has just enough caffeine in it to keep me going! It's great stuff, and I highly recommend it."
5,An excellent historic book.,"I have admired Henry Kissinger for many years. I think he is one of those limited intellectual diplomacies who really have, not only limited to one's word, a long term vision. It's really enjoyable when you read his book and share his thoughts."
4,From the horse's mouth,"Indispensable for whoever is interested in the history of the Nixon and Ford administrations and othe world in these troubled times, from an unreplacable vantage point. Not exceedingly self-serving. Kindle edition welcome for this heavy book: you can carry all three volumes -The White House Years, Years of Upheaval and Years of Renewal- around with you, something that was impossible to do with the paper edition. And you have also a search function."
4,DigiView is A Good View!,"I had been trying to get various Casper, the Friendly Ghost cartoons, uncut on dvd for some time. Shout! Factory issued a Casper release in Oct. 2011. But alas they were edited. Beginning/end title cards shortened. So I took a chance with this release from DigiView, particularly these first four cartoons (out of eight) that spotlight Casper. My primary interest was in the cartoon SPOOKING ABOUT AFRICA. I am very happy to report that this cartoon in unedited, with the Harveytoons logo before and at the end! Hooray! The Casper theme song was replaced in the 50s by a spooky instrumental arrangement. Just like it was originally released at the time (I know, I know...Paramount sold off these cartoons to Harvey. Paramount's logo was the first thing you saw). I paid pennies for this dvd. Well worth it."
5,Does What It Should,"This calculator is perfect for my needs. I needed a good set of functions, printing, and a small footprint. It has all these features plus I can unplug it and use it on battery power."
3,Good calculator...,"Overall, this is a good desktop calculator. However, I think I did a little overkill when I purchased it and I really don't need all of its functions - so, that's my own fault. However, I guess too that I just don't like too much how some of the functions work and are laid out on the keypad. The print function works fine but it just seemed to be a bit of ""pain"" to me. Again, more than I really needed. For a business professional, this would probably be a very good calculator. It seems to work great and seems to be well-made I just don't really use it enough. I'll keep using my little hand-held until it gives out but I would still recommend this calculator to someone who can truly use all of its functions."
3,Fine,Was about what we expected in ordering it. Works fine and that is what matters. They could have included a little more of the paper.
2,Two big deficiencies,"The machine works. However the instruction sheet is a disaster, way too small and mixes English and Spanish. The PDF is just a repeat of the way too small print enclosed sheet.And, see that nice roll of paper in the pic? You don't get that. You get a tiny roll with a few feet of paper. Not a big expense, but a big inconvenience! I looked for paper on Home Depot's site. I can get a roll of paper for $0.89 and $11.29 shipping + tax, of course."
1,"It was alright but damaged in shipment, not the shippers fault","I can't review it, it did not work, damaged in shipment. Not the shippers fault, it was post Office fault."
5,A great tool at tax time,"Excellent features, easy to use, as good as the bigger models. A must have if you do your own accounting, especially at tax time."
4,I really count on this!,"Sharp EL-1750V Portable Printing Color Calculator with Clock and CalendarThis calculator was priced well, was delivered quickly, and is everything I had hoped it would be. Easy functions, nice layout for my hand, dual color makes deductions easy to spot. Calendar & the clock make it easy to review most recent calculations. Would recommend this item to anyone who is in need. Thanks for continued good prices, service & products."
3,You only get one,"Seems like a fine cat toy, but unlike the picture, you only get one of these toys, and for the current price of $8 that's a little steep. Next time, I'll just go to Petco."
1,Rip Off,Very disappointed. Same product can be purchased at Petco for under $5. I was expecting 3 toys at price listed. You will only receive 1. Total ripoff.
4,Great toy,I bought this as a gift for a friend it's great. I'd definitely recommend it for kids and adults alike.
4,Echo,"What ocean lover can resist this pudgy, floppy, navy colored dolphin? He is very cute, and fun to play with. He is also nice if you have an ocean Beanie display, like I have in my bedroom. I don't think I'd ever have the heart to get rid of him, and I think collecters will enjoy him as well as children who love dolphins. Definately one of the better Beanies."
1,technical support is torture...,"Our Replay failed after 6 months. We paid 1-way shipping for a non-functional replacement with beta software installed in it. After 6 hour long calls to different offshore ""technicians"", leading us through painful and sometimes silly reconfigurations of cable modem, router, and Replay (which left the rest of the LAN nonfunctional), we were told ""we understand there's a problem with the unit, we'll email you what to do"". And like two previous promises to have a technical expert phone us, no thing followed. Please buy something else -- these folks don't deserve your money."
2,OK product ruined by horrible tech support,"I echo the other reviewers' complaints regarding poor tech support from Replay TV. Our unit performed satisfactorily for the first 13 months, then the modem stopped working. After several frustrating calls to the apparently offshore tech support, where I was forced to perform the same troubleshooting steps over several times and where case notes from my prior calls were not retrievable for reference by the customer reps, I was told that I could return my unit and receive an out-of-warranty replacement, for a cost of $99.95, plus my shipping costs. However, I could not find my receipt to accompany the defective unit, so I am out of luck. We spent a lot of money for a device that lasted only 13 months."
3,Poor Customer Support,"Recently ReplayTV's tech support was cahnged for a toll free number to a toll number. The major problem is that when you call Tech Support you are on hold for a very long time thus running up your phone bill. The last time I called I waited 20 minutes before hanging up. Keep this in mind when buying ReplayTV because you will undoubtedly need support someday. You can, of course, use their email support and wait 3-5 days for a response."
1,If only I could Give this ZERO Stars!,"REPLAY TV has been a disaster for me since the moment it arrived on my doorstep. After 10 days of technical problems with the unit, I gave up and sent it back to REPLAY TV for a refund. 35 days later, I still do not have my money back. First I was told that they changed warehouses and that it was sent to the wrong one, despite the fact that their customer service told me where to send it. Today I received an email telling me that they had shipped me a replacement unit, even though I cancelled the account a month ago and spent $30 to ship it back. Their customer service is horrific. I now have TIVO through DirectTV and couldn't be happier!"
3,Nice but BUGGY!,"I got this unit about a year ago and love the features and the graphical user interface. BUT... I have been terribly frustrated with this unit's poor modem and its tendancy to freeze up. What are they running in there - some sort of Windows-based OS? I'm used to having to reboot my PC, but having to cycle power on what should be a real consumer electronics box is unacceptable to me. My next DVR will be a Tivo."
1,Very Dissapointed,"Never worked from the begining. If it was recording, you couldn't watch the tv. Then, to replay the recording, it said no video signal. The 800 number is not available, so it is long distance to try and speak with a first level know nothing. It screws with the regular cable/tv/avr remote control by delaying your key presses. I have not despised an inanimate object as much as this, and this is after researching the brand and model."
1,Is Paid Service Required?,Dear ReplayTV users...HIOK..In the reviews for TiVo here on Amazon it is stated that there is NO NEED for paid service to use tivo if your willing to manualy program the unit youself as you would a normal VCR. Is it the same w/ReplayTV?
2,Get aTIVO,"I bought a Tivo for my son for Christmas and a RePlay for myself. Loved the RePlay when I first got it. I especially liked the fact that I could network it instead of hooking it to a phone line. And it seemed easier to set up then the Tivo. However getting your REBATE from these guys is like next to impossible. You are missing this item and then that item,then your Activation key doesn't show up in their database even when I have been having service for the last 4 months and getting billing emails from them. Got the TIVO rebate in 6 weeks. Finally sent the last letter to them with a copy of my monthly bill, telling them if they can't get it right I will probably cancel service soon and get a Tivo. A week later they billed me for the next month and 2 days after that( a week after the warranty was done) my RePlay died, the AV plugs ins will not take a Video signal in. I now can only replay my Basic cable no pay services. Save your money and get a TIVO!"
3,NOT lifetime service,"This would have gotten a 4, but it does not state that this model does *not* include lifetime service. It includes 3 years of service. Apparently all of the 5500 series only include 3 years and there is no way to get lifetime activation. So be aware of this before you buy!"
1,Pure crap.,"My Replay TV 5504 died after 4 months. I called ""technical"" support and was told to ""unplug it for exactly 30 seconds, and if that doesn't work, we can send you a refurbished model for $85."" I explained to the idiot that I was still within the warranty period, which is when he dropped the cost to $35 for ""labor fees."" I asked why I was having to pay almost what I paid for the item in the first place, when it is their product that is defective. This is when he explained to me that ""$35 for a refurbished model is a deal, and a refurbished model is actually much better than a brand new one because all of the bugs have been worked out of it."" This really instills my confidence in the Replay TV products - why is it that they have so many refurbished units? Because they are crap. Good riddance Replay TV - I'm switching to Tivo."
1,I think it is cheating,"When I bought the ReplayTV RTV5508 unit, it clearly said that it came with three years service, also it also indicated in the box of that unit. It is very clear that the company should stick to its promise no matter what. I think whoever bought the unit should come forward to file the complaint and make the company fulfill the contract. I don't think it is a small issue,it is about the consumer's right and it should be protected."
1,Tivo is better,This product is over-priced and overly complicated. The high- end networking features are time consuming and expensive to activate.
4,ReplayTv 5404,Very happy with the 5404. Added this baby to my network router with broadband connect. Install was simple.Already hacked it with 160gb harddrive. $139.00 for the hardrive and $111.00 for unit itself. Total cost for 160 hour PVR $250.00. Works perfect.
1,I too was taken... I will never own or recommend a Replaytv,"I too purchased a ""pre-activated"" 5504 from Circuit City through amazon.com. Advertised as 3 years of service included on the website, called and confirmed the sale and service was included with representatives at replaytv, confirmed with reps at Circuit City that the unit I purchased included service, and registered the unit on 12/20 and hooked it up without additional service commitments. Then on the morining of 12/29 the company de-activated my unit. According to them, their policies have changed and I'm now required to pay a subscription. Today was the first day I heard such a thing! So, this company took it upon themselves to disconnect my service and render by unit useless while I slept. My recommendation, buy a TIVO. I sure wish I did."
1,Deceptive Advertising - 3 yr service not included,"The sale price in the add is 299.97 The features listed in the ad include ""Pre-activated, with no service fee for 3 years; after 3 years, just $.99 per month ."" However, after placing the order through Amazon.com, I received an e-mail from Circuit City informing me that as of Dec 17th (coincidently the same day I made my purchase) the 3 year service fee is no longer included. Instead there would be either a 299.99 fee for the lifetime of the unit, or a 12.95 per month charge. I called Circuit City and was told that the ad was in error, and is the result of a change in ReplayTV policy. Therefore the difference represented in the ad between the list price and the selling price is basically the cost of the 3 yr service subscription. ""You Save"" 0.00"
5,"Agree with below, Great Product","There is no automatic commerical skip, but all you have to do now is press one button before each break and they are all skipped.Unlike TiVo, you can set it up so it will only record a show at a certain timeslot. That way, it will (example) only record ""The Daily Show"" @ 11pm and not the 2 re-airings that are not marked by either DVR as ""Rerun"" (which TiVo records along with the 11pm ones).You can program over the internet for free, quickskip 30-seconds ahead, do what TiVo calls a ""Season Pass"" with any episodes of a certain show under what Replay calls a ""Show-based theme"", have it find any shows/movies with a certain actor or topic, etc."
2,Quit working within first week!,"I was very excited to get this unit. I purchased in conjunction with a DVD recorder so I could archive to DVD. Set up wasn't too difficult, and of course I purchased the life time $299 subscription. Within a week of using the unit, the ReplayTV stopped sending signals to my DVD recorder...all that was sent was static. I know it wasn't the DVD recorder, because I can still record directly from television. ReplayTV no longer has a toll-free customer service line, so after a 29 minute hold and conversation with their customer service department, I am now awaiting a Return Merchandise Authorization Number in order to get the unit replaced. I will also be contacting Amazon directly to see if they can be of any assistance. I don't know if TIVO would have been any better, but I think this really sucks!"
1,Useless,"I put the holder in the visor as it is supposed to...placed three CDs in...started driving...Within five minutes all the cds were on the floor. Looks nice, seems good, but doesn't hold onto the darn CDs."
1,Looks nothing like the picture!,"Come on! Make sure the product your showing at least matches what you send to people buying it. The product itself is fine, but it's really irritating when people do that. I expected one thing and got another!"
4,bush rocks!!!!! buy this!,"well im defiantely bias because im a humungoid bush freak and i love this song, but the 3rd track, the remix, has no hintof the song that i love so dearly, its a bunch of beats that midway gets interrupted by a black guy who says ""i wanna get naked baby"" and that was definately stupid. but the rest is cool! if ur a bush fan, u should get this!"
4,The program works Great!,"The ArcSoft Panorama Maker combines several photos to create a single seamless panoramic (it can be much wider than the best wide angle lense can give you), either long and short or tall and narrow. It works best if you use a tripod set at the same hight for all the pictures, it covers any area shown on the next picture to make a seamless panoramic.If you want to make a picture that will remain flat when you view it, you need to move the tripod over a few feet for every picture, and make sure you are the same distance from the object.If you want to display your picture in a bowl shape, just leave your tripod on the same spot and rotate it for each pictere."
1,The ball and the ring don't fit,"The ball is too small for the ring (base) so it is not ""stable"". Just purchase ball for your body size & height and save money."
1,Misleading,"There was only 1 toy for the price. My cat loves these toys and for this price, I could have gotten him a couple. Not happy"
2,It's only one toy,"I bought this for my cat thinking i would be getting a bundle, but it's only one toy. She loves playing with it, but the picture was a little misleading. there's no reason to spend so much on a single feather toy."
4,This book tought me whatis the happiness,"MY BOOK REPORT The pearl This book is writed about happiness and unhappines. There is a family they are very poor. Main charactor is Kino. Though they are poor and rich persons always look down on them, they were living peacefully.But one day they found a pearl. It is very big pearl. As soon as the neighbor have heard that news. They changed ther attitude to them. The familly knew they all envey. Every night they cant sleep, and they became that theycan not believe their neighbors. After all they threw it away to the sea. This book tought me that happiness is not a money. We cant buy a happiness by money.Sometimes too much wealth cause a trouble in human society. May be killed by your sweethoney."
5,Clear Sounds Emergency Phoe,"This product is GREAT for elderly people. I got an older version for my 80+ year old mother who had the misfortune to have to use it several times. Twice it saved her life. She was on the floor once and it called me and we could speak to each other from the pendant and she wasn't even close to the phone. It calls several numbers and continues until the person called presses a number to acknowlege receiving the call. I had it call me first, then 911, then others. Unlike ADT and other services, this costs nothing. This is the solution you have been looking for."
1,Poor Picture Quality,"We had not one but 2 Hitachi 36UX59B. The picture was distorted, the color was off from channel to channel, the edges of the screen shook. Too many lines visible and overall not worth the money. 2 went back in a week. Even had a cable expert out to check wiring etc, Maybe it was a bad batch. Anyone else have this problem?"
2,Bootleg,"This is a bootleg, Some of the tracks are fake with no Hendrix involved and a good number of them are incorrectly titled."
2,Feels cheap and works like it feels,"I bought this to replace a similar tool that had been borrowed from me--yeah, yeah, I know--because it had the rubber nozzle end for the blower. I really like having that soft end, and this unit also came with other attachments that made it seem like it was going to be wonderful. WRONG! When I attached it to the compressor, the rubber nozzle blew off the end and now it won't go back on securely. The threads on the various parts are stiff and tightening them makes you nervous because you feel like maybe they won't be able to be removed if you use the force necessary to attach them. Bad machine work is all that is. I usually think of Northern Industrial as a quality supplier. This piece gave them a black eye in my book."
4,Nice reference book,"This book is a nice library of basic patterns. It's nice to have on hand if you need to put a garment together for a holiday and you don't have a particular plate in mind. It is also a nice starting point for designing your own, more complex designs. Most of the books I've found on smocking have weird, abstract designs or the fashions in them are hopelessly out-of-date. This is a refreshing change."
1,Don't buy it!,"The program is awful, I still haven't gotten it to work on my MAC yet and can't get no 800 support and or anyone from the company to email me back!!! It absolutely doesn't work!"
5,Good history story,An interesting look at the history of that periods through the eyes of someone who took part in many important events of the 1800's.
1,"A narcisstic, self-obsessed woman who should be forgotten","Mabel does not deserve a celebrated place in history. Mabel represents everything small, untalented, and selfish in our society. She was a self-absorbed, mediocre, spoiled brat who did far more to hurt and exploit people (including her child) than to help, so why is she still applauded for doing precious little except obsessing on herself her entire life?"
2,Bent and scratched purchase,Bought a metal coke sign when it arrived it was bent and creased straight down the middle with scratches running down the sides of the sign
4,Beware your cat might go crazy !,"Very powerful catnip follows the Turbo Scratcher, cats try to catch imaginary mice... Otherwise, the cat plays for a while with it until getting exhausted (both physically and mentally - of not being able to take the ball out of the device).Very good toy for cats, a bit big (size) but worth the price..."
5,a must for cats,"Picked this up based on all the reviews. Our cat has been playing with this toy from the first time she saw it until she gets worn out. Fantastic toy, our dog loves playing with it too. Great find"
2,Not for some cats,"This toy is okay for some, but my rambunctious kitty is bored with it. She watches it, but that's all."
5,cats LOVE IT,"Whenever we cant find either of our 2 cats, we give this a spin and they both come running within a few spins. It is loud, but its a toy for the cats when they dont have someone to play with them, especially good for single cat homes. But our 2 cats have 2 of these and love having the scratching pad along with the ball and have responded better to this toy than the lazer pointer rotating one which just seemed to baffle them (they arent very smart). But whenever I need them to come I spin the thing and 2 excited or very sleepy and excited cats come. They get more exercise with this toy than having just the toys we use to play with them. Very inexpensive for how much the kitties love it, would replace if either one fell apart and would suggest to everyone with one or more cats!"
3,Really good,"My cat loves this. She doesnt use my chair to sharpen her claws anymore. I always find her sitting on this scratcher and its funny when she pushes the ball around. This product is very cheap and definitely worth the money. It makes my cat happy so I am happyEdit: After a couple months my cat completely lost interest. No longer scratches with it, no longer plays with the ball. Bought her a vertical scratcher and she is using that now. This went in the closet"
4,The Throne,"I got this for my new cat who needed an outlet. She likes best to sit on it. I used up all the catnip. Mostly she sits on it, but both cats have used it to scratch. Neither is interested in the ball."
