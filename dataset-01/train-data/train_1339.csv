2,Darkfall: A Dark Disappointment,"This is NOT a Koontz classic! This reads like the Sunday comics;""Don't worry about it."" ""And thanks for the advice."" ""Us girls gotta stick together."" Rebecca said. ""Isn't that the truth."" Shelly said. She left the room.For being a legend storyteller, Dean dropped this one big time! Perhaps because it was one of his earlier works-is the reason for the simplistic approach and plot. One thing for sure, you'll be fast asleep by 9:00pm - instead of the typical Koontz 2:30am page-turner. Whatever, but don't waste your time or money on this one!"
3,It's a cute idea for a sippy cup,"My toddler loves that it sparkles, but doesn't like to drink from it for some reason.And it leaks..... very easily.But it definitely fun to have in the dark- especially in the car. =)"
4,Quietly Menacing,"The release of Christie Malry's Own Double Entry, a soundtrack, and The Oliver Twist Manifesto, a solo album, within weeks of each other confirms Luke Haines place - at least in Britain - as an agent provocateur of modern music. Christie Malry's Own Double Entry is the soundtrack to a film about modern terrorism, a subject that has haunted Haines work with both The Auteurs and Baader Meinhof. The instrumental work is quietly menacing - loads of strings and glockenspiel. The vocal tracks are cynical, as always, and more grim than usual. ""In the Bleak Midwinter"", with the Winchester Cathedral Choir, is horrific yet beautiful, and his remake of Nick Lowe's ""(I Love the Sound of) Breaking Glass"" a masterstroke."
1,Movie Star 5 is junk,"I've had nothing but trouble with this product. The XP version is very buggy and virtually unusable. Even with the latest patches, the software simply does not function. I cannot recommend this product to anyone."
1,Didn't work for me,"I tried making SVCD's with this.... ended up with several coasters before I gave up. All of the SVCD's seemed to render and burn OK, but when I tried playing them in my 8 month old DVD player, they were unwatchable. The video was completely distorted with hundreds of lines throughout the picture. When I made SVCD's with Ulead and Sonic MyDVD product, they worked fine every time. I don't know how it works for DVD's, but based on my experience, I wouldn't buy this product."
1,Disappointment,"This product appears not to work under Windows XP. To make matters worse, there is no product support! It took almost two months to get a reply from product support and then the answer didn't pertain to my problem. I had to discard this product and purchase another, thus being out the cost of the product entirely."
1,Movie Star Obsolete No Tech Support No DVD burning,"I was so thrilled to convert by VHS tapes to DVD until I discovered that even my 80 gig hard drive was not enough for a 20 minute video AND once I had the AVI video and tried to burn the DVD the software said I had to go to dazzle.com to PURCHASE a $100 upgrade. The hardware and bundle only cost $40! There is no tech support effective 10/24/03 for any Dazzle DVC 80 Movie Star v. 5. Therefore, you use up your hard drive and can't off load it anyway. What a waste! You have to delete the capture that took you 5 hours to produce. LOSER!"
1,Terrible,The only mode to capture video is in AVI format. The files become so huge after just a minute of recording that they are uneditable and you can't produce anything. A complete right off.
5,Good information,This book gives information in an easy-to-read format about issues none of us really want to discuss. It's very necessary to make the plans discussed in this book.
4,Rare look at Mexican culture at turn of the century,"A rare look at Mexican social, family, sports life through copper tinted full page black & white photos taken in the early part of the 20th century. About 60 pages. Text is in Spanish. I enjoyed the photos without it!"
4,Great piece of rock film history.,"The plot is nothing special - typical ""rise and fall of"" story with a happy ending told by montage under the end credits. (In this case, the happy ending involves the characters becoming a cheesy Go-Gos type 80s band.)What is interesting is seeing Steve Jones, Paul Cook (Sex Pistols) and Paul Simonon (The Clash) in their roles as a competing punk band. They're playing comic book versions of themselves, essentially, and doing a decent job at it."
3,For Diane Lane fans.,Diane Lane is one of my favorite actresses. I think she was only about sixteen when she made this. She's been working at her craft a long time.
5,"Happy With The Merchant,so so on the actual movie.,...","The seller was great. Movie worked and came quickly. The movie itself? Disappointing. I had heard so much about this flick over the years....but the acting is terrible. Diane Lane sucks as an actress. Steve Jones, Paul Simonon and Paul Cook didn't have nearly enough to do.....the subplots are half assed....and the whole affair feels calculated to cash in on a fading Punk fad...."
4,Rob,"If you love the Professionals you'll dig this. A great lost teen movie. Buy it now, or tomorrow but don't wait any longer."
3,Some History for Punk Geeks...Like Me,"It's hard to find anything redeeming or worthwhile about the film besides the involvement of Steve Jones and Paul Cook of Pistols fame, and Paul Simonon of the Clash acting as the band of the second band on the tour bill.The movie is abysmal. The acting is so sub-par, I think a new scale of ""crap"" is reached. HOWEVER: it is here we can here the song, ""Join the Professionals"" from the budding Jones/Cook ex-Pistols project, aptly named, the Professionals.No one really should've asked Jones and Cook to act after seeing their thespian skills in ""The Great Rock n' Roll Swindle,"" but all in all, a cool thing for Jonesy fans like myself.If you watch the film in a MST3K state of mind, it's entertaining. Just watch for the Professionals songs.It is crap, but I'll be first to buy this crap when it is rereleased on DVD. Long Live Steve Jones!"
3,Nostalgia,"I was digging through a box of old videos that I had taped years ago. I put this in and went crazy. I decided to put it on DVD myself, but I'm hoping it gets released on it's own very soon. Yes the acting is the worst, but the music by Steve Jones and Paul Cook is great and having grown up in the 80's and 90's. This is a classic."
5,"Young, hard, and real","Diane Lane is amazing. She is raw, and real and full of fire. This movie, as old as it is, is NEVER just phoned in. It shows the reality of touring on the bus, the reality of how rabid fans can be, and how things change quickly, and not for the better sometimes.And there is Fee Wayback as a washed up rock star, still touring. If you want to see the reality of rock, and see Diane Lane, stunningly beautiful (as always), this is the movie! 5 stars!"
2,Scattershot and Only Occasionally Entertaining,"It's not easy to classify this film. It's part rock 'n' roll/media satire, part After School Special on post-feminism, occasionally silly, occasionally overly earnest. Some decent music, along with some very bad music, a VERY young Diane Lane, Laura Dern and Ray Winstone make the film interesting as a curio, but I doubt this 'band' will rock many people's worlds."
5,JOIN THE PROFESSIONALS,Just as everyone was starting to believe it would never happen....never say never. The definitive rock 'n' roll movie has finally made it to DVD.
1,"The film okay, the DVD awful.","This was a terrific film, in concept, in casting, and in filming; it was gritty and dirty and true to life- almost prophetic of the instant fame to infamy cycle we are living through today all with a backstage access . The DVD though is a total wash . The captioning doesn't work, the photo gallery doesn't exist . If you must have a copy of this, wait until a major studio releases it ."
2,Weak and disorganized,"After some years in the IC design business (mostly analog) I needed to teach a course on ASICSs. This book was the text specified by my predecessor. I did not like the book, and eventually read the Weste and Harris book in its 3rd edition. Wolf is not nearly as clear, complete and logically organized as Weste and Harris - no comparison."
2,Shocking lack of editorial oversight,"This could be a great book but it is let down by truly awful editing. Wolf writes well but his clarity is lost in the sea of mistakes that made it to press. The text often refers to the wrong figure or to one not present, figures are duplicated, formulas have mistakes in them (including easy to find errors like mismatched parenthesis), node and component names are renamed in place but not another, etc., etc.Basically the editors were asleep at the wheel. In general you will spend easily as much time trying to weed out the numerous mistakes as you will actually learning anything. Or worse give up thinking that the subject matter is beyond you.How this book made it to third edition in such a raw state is beyond me and a black mark on Prentice Hall's usually excellent editorial reputation. Do yourself a favor and avoid this book."
1,chopped off the end,"I'm sorry, this review is not for the movie itself (an excellent 5-star movie) but this particular version of it. The end of the movie, I believe, it the most powerfull part of it: a list of the people who would not be born if these were our ways, and the message ""the other birth that certainly would not have taken place, is your own"". This is the entire point of the movie, and for some rediculous reason, has been removed from this version. Don't tell me they couldn't fit the last 20 seconds onto a DVD."
4,Very Solid,"Not a five-ster film, but you can do a lot worse than spending a couple of hours with Gattaca. As with most sci-fi you're required to check your common sense at the door, but that's part of the fun of it. If you've ever found yourself rooting for the underdog you should enjoy this one. I found it tugged on a couple of my heartstrings. See it."
3,"Over-rated, at best..","A disappointment, to say the least.. I actually heard it was in the to 250, and can only hope that was,a joke,a rumor, a mistake, a falsity!!"
3,Gattaca,The movie was intriguing in theme. It would've been stronger with less narration.It was visually and conceptually interesting. The deleted scenes helped me understandsome of the plot. Ernest Borgnine's part suffered from the deletions.
3,Gattaca,"An interesting look into the future. The brain child of Director and Writer Andrew Niccol, I enjoyed this movie, but I feel that his other two films The Truman Show and Lord of War were superior."
3,intriguing . . . yet disappointing,"i found this film to be extraodinarily intricate and fascinating, yet the motivation of the character of Vincent to enter and conform to the tenets of a corrupt society are somewhat disheartening. although this is perhaps a realistic slant to the story, it seems to undermine the overall conceit of the film, which is the critique of the desire to acquire perfection."
1,disturbing themes/ messages here,"I was thoroughly enjoying this film until the last five minutes. No spoilers, but the end undermined the entire theme that I thought was building throughout. The protagonist Vincent does not create a new system and prove this draconian genetic world wrong. He instead finds a way to simply get ahead within the system. I compare this to Bradbury's classic work, Fahrenheit 451, that depicts a similar draconian, oppressive world, but gives us an entirely different ending. I will not even discuss the message the character of Eugene and his end sends to disabled people..."
3,Not a Sci-Fi Movie,"This film is well produced and well-acted, but has virtually no sci-fi elements in it. The ethical and social arguments are valid ( no pun intended ) but I was dissapointed in its lack of action, lack of sci-fi imagery and morose backround music. At times it is little more than a detective story, or a human interest drama. The film needed more excitement and much more creative imagery. Setting is given the back seat and there was no reason for that. What could have been a grand film is only average, though well acted."
5,It's happening as we speak people!...,"Most people have no idea just how close this is to becoming a reality. This is why ""GATTACA"" is the single scarriest movie I have ever seen!"
4,Gattaca (1997),"Written and directed by Andrew Niccol, this provocative sci-fi thriller envisions a world in which society is fixated on genetics and human-enhancement, and everyone of privileged social standing is classified as either a ""valid""--one who is genetically sound--or an ""in-valid""--one whose genotype is lesser than that of a valid's. Gattaca is a strong and very intellectual film that poses questions regarding destiny and our society's burdening quest for perfection. It features an enticing cast (which includes Uma Thurman, Ethan Hawke, Jude Law, and Alan Arkin), a stimulating premise, and fervent execution of the done-over murder-thriller plot."
2,"Strange, no director or actor commentary option during play of film.","Why didn't the producers of this DVD not have the Director or Actor or Cinematographer give running commentary. No option for running commentary?! What, you think I'm stupid and don't know what most other DVDs have? Do we have an elitist director never saying a blessed word even during a production documentary about his own movie ever? What's going on here?Great movie, however again stupid DVD that also edits out the montage following the credits: who of the famous would not have been famous with the standards of the ""Gattaca"" world."
2,Not so good...,"I bougth this title after reading much praise. Personally I am very disappointed. Concept is good but treatment is bad. First half was superb. However, direction and story lost the track in second half."
2,IT'S IN THE GENES,"Welcome to a not too distant future where genetically superior humans get all the good jobs, while those born naturally have to piddle their way through the mundane jobs. Enter Ethan Hawke, the ""human"" who wants to go to Titan, one of the moons of Jupiter, but to do so has to convince Gattaca, the corporation involved, that he is a genetically enhanced human. He ""borrows"" the vital fluids of a crippled VALID, played nicely by Jude Law, and manages to get to the top of the list of space travelers. The murder of an important director, however, may be his undoing, as his true identity becomes more and more revelant. Critically acclaimed as one of the more intelligent of sci-fi films of the nineties, GATTACA is competently done, with nice performances from Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin and Loren Dean, but ultimately its leisurely pace and lack of true surprises makes it merely an exercise in style with a potential message overshadowed by its manipulation. Not one of my favorites."
3,Again a film where the end is cold !!!,"I like this film because, i think the story is very good. I like the part of the film where Jerome swims whith his brother as far as they can and the loser is the one who is scared,[...]. The world of Gattaca looks like South Africa (before 1990's)or the United States, (before 1770's)the blacks could not work with the whites. It's a racist System, it's a crime against mankind. In Gattaca life is easy for ""the perfect persons"", they can become doctors, astronauts but for the ""invalids"" life is very hard they must sweep or clean the building of Gattaca."
2,Cure for insomnia,"This film has lots going for it - a fine soundtrack (Michael Nyman), some interesting sets, even Uma Thurman. . . But it is fantastically dull.The basic premise, outlined in detail elsewhere, has been far more entertainingly explored in films like Blade Runner, and 'The Boys from Brazil'.If you're seeking some intelligent dystopia, try 'Brazil' - or if you're really highbrow, read 'The Man in the High Castle', or 'Brave New World'.I hate to slag off a film that has so much going for it (it is good to see Alan Arkin and Gore Vidal up there on the silver screen), but to be honest, I found this lacking in any depth whatsoever. I can hear the groans from here, but I found 'Paycheck' a lot more thought-provoking. . ."
5,PERFECT MOVIE - PERFECT DVD,"I own both, first I bought the video, then after having seen the movie a dozen times I bought the DVD. And it was worth the money. Excellent picture quality, perfect sound, I enjoy the spatial sound of people talking in the halls of gattaca space university (as I call it). The story is perfect science fiction very close to reality. I like the deeper meaning of this movie: the power of the human spirit to achieve any goal, even if it seems too far away and in spite of any given circumstances as bad as these might even be. Ethan Hawke's performance is incredible, the storyline is breathtaking. I rate this movie BETTER THAN THE MATRIX. Do you feel bad about your life or your career? Watch GATTACA!"
3,I may trade mine for non-superbit,"Great movie, but if I had to do it over again I'd skip the superbit edition.My eyes aren't sophisticated enough to see much difference in quality between regular DVD and superbit. Yet the superbit takes up so much space on the disk there's no room left for those 'extras' we all love, like commentaries etc. It's just the film.This, by the way, is what I call a ""real"" science fiction film; that is, it has a plausible plotline based on real science, rather than ""space opera"" like Star Wars or pop schlock like ""ET"" and ""Close Encounters."""
5,"One of the most ""fluid"" films I have ever seen.","Unlike most other sci-fi films, Gattaca presents itself to the viewer in an extraordinarily mellow fashion. A thought-provoking tale of genetic discrimination in a near-future society, Gattaca seems very much to flow like a liquid over its audience. With exceptional production design (I especially liked Uma Thurman's mid-sixties vintage Citroen DS-21 convertible!), affecting performances, and gorgeous music, Gattaca paints a very convincing picture of a not-too-distant and not altogether implausible society. Kudos to first-time director Andrew Niccol and veteran composer Michael Nyman. (If you are a fan of film music, pick up the score to this film - it contains some of the most stirring yet relaxing themes this reviewer has ever heard.)"
4,Futuristic Fantastic Movie,"Really special Movie, it goes all the way.Ranging up there with the greatest sci-fi/reality movies (can somewhat, be compared to ""2001"") Fantastic"
5,Classic movie,This movie is awesome in my books. It's looks at humanities attempt for perfection and the struggle of one man to rise above the social norm.
5,Great Movie!,"The storyline is fantastic, and the acting is just as great! If you are a sci-fi lover, then this is a movie you will enjoy. Even if you aren't, it is still a really great movie!"
5,Great sci-fi movie that takes place on entirely Earth,"It's a science fiction/drama movie that takes place in a surreal American future. This movie's main theme is ""you can reach your goals even in circumstances where other's have already written you off because they think you don't have the potential for greatness."" to some extent."
5,Sci-fi as it was meant to be: inteligent,"This movie was brilliant, it had a story that was both simple as it was complex. Everything about this movie breathes science fiction, but if you look at the state our current society and technology is in, you will notice the frightening world of Gattaca is not as far as it seems.The setting is beautifully done, every image gives you the idea you're living in a stylish new society, as if your looking at the designs for the image of our own future.Everything is big, yet the characters remain small and still interesting enough to carry the story. In the world of Gattaca you are a mere number, but in this impersonal world you actually see that the characters are not all robots in a society that has made rules by which all must live, but individuals that wish to break those rules and find their own personality in an endless sea.Any inteligent human being that loves sci-fi must have seen this movie at least once."
5,Gattaca,"A beautiful and poignant film, even more relevant now than when released. This should be required viewing for US citizens lest they think that civil liberties are expendable.When our inept politicians claim to know who arethe superior persons, and with the scientific advances in genetic research, this may not be science fiction after all."
5,love this movie,"buy it, you'll love it. Very good story and excellent actors. You will never get tired of watching this movie."
3,"Dark, heavy, and slow","I was looking forward to this movie. The underlying subject is pretty serious: a future where genetic engineering leads to a quasi-caste system where society is divided between people who are enhanced and people who are ""normal."" The actual plot of the movie, however, moves a bit slow. This is definitely a more cerebral movie; no car chases or shoot-outs here. Even so, I was underwhelmed by the film...Not bad but not recommended."
4,Paradox,"If you are a scientific minded person and believe in genes, then you better ask yourself how(?) far are you willing to go. Great movie."
4,a very smart movie,"Gattaca is one of the smartest sci-fi-movies of the year. It's also very stylish - and unfortunately sometimes pretty boring. But when you know that this is no 'Starship Troopers', you will have a great time. Jude Law is fantastic!"
5,"I don't Like Science Fiction, BUT I LOVE THIS MOVIE","This is a great movie. I am not into science fiction or even movies that really make you think, but I love this movie. The cast is great and it is so good. I am taking a genetics class now, that is where I watched this, and we have been discussing everything that is happening in the movie. This is a great movie, even if you just watch is for super hot Ethan Hawk and Jude Law!"
2,***** Five Star Film -- Two Stars for pan/scan DVD,"Absolutely a thought provoking, entertaining film. Excellentproduction values. Wonderful acting.The green cover DVD is pan and scan (1.33). It is the first panand scan that demonstrated to me that not seeing the edgesas well as the center can make a scene almost unintelligible. Iwill never buy a 1.33 aspect ratio DVD again unless that was theoriginal aspect ratio (e.g. vintage B/W, etc.)I don't know about the superbit version. I would hope that for$25 or more you get to see the real film. I will eventually addit to my collection."
2,sucked,"i thought it would get more eceiting but i was wrong, sand the two guys dont look a like at all"
1,Buyer Beware,"Some information in the ""Product Details"" section for the non-Superbit DVD release of ""Gattaca"" may cause confusion as to whether this issue includes a widescreen (2.35:1) presentation. The ""Format"" section lists the available presentation as ""Full Screen"" (i.e. ""Pan & Scan"" for any widescreen theatrical movie), while the ""Aspect Ratio"" section lists a 2.35:1 (widescreen) aspect ratio. To clear things up, the theatrical presentation is widescreen (2.35:1), but the DVD presentation is pan & scan (1.33:1), not widescreen. It says so on the back of the DVD case cover insert. The Superbit DVD release of ""Gattaca"" includes a widescreen presentation at a heftier price."
4,classic,"I first saw this movie on the big screen. I was impressed. Great actors, on the edge of your seat suspense. The twist and turns of the plot keep you going all the way to the dramatic conclusion."
3,Interesting premise of where we might be going someday,"This movie sees a day where babies are DNA tested for a wide-variety of traits and disease risks. With that data, children are slotted into their lifetime range of allowable education and careers. The movie shows ""inspectors"" coming through the workplace to collect tissue samples (vacuuming keyboards, collecting samples from drinking glasses) to find cheaters. There is even a special police force to seek out those trying to cheat the system. Not a block-buster movie by any definition, however it is a good yarn in a ""what if"" world."
3,"the more I thought about it, the less I liked it","In a future where genetic manipulation has reached the point that most sicknesses and defects can be eliminated at conception, one man (whose parents didn't opt for this procedure) faces discrimination from more ""perfect"" people. He finds a way to pose as a genetically perfect person so he can pursue his dream of being an astronaut, but a murder investigation stands the chance of exposing him...Although competently made, the film suffers from being overly-preachy -- based (intentionally?) on a misunderstanding of eugenics -- and in itself has a couple of gaping plot holes. Add to that Uma Thurmon's utterly lifeless performance and lack of chemistry with the rest of the cast, and you have a film that has a hint of potential that it fails to live up to.I *tried* to like this film, too. I'm surprised there is such a ""cult"" following for it. At best it is worth watching once."
3,Superbit edition suffers from same flaw as most - lost stuff,"As with too many other SuperBit editions, this onesimply dumped the special features (documentaryfeaturette in this case) present on the original edition.I'm not sure when this studio's going to clue in thatthe main reason people buy DVD over VHS isextra features. Maybe they are starting to understandthis, as both The Patriot and Hollow Man [why? it was a total waste of film...] have been issued as ""SuperBit Deluxe"" editions with an extra disc containing the special features that were on the original ""NormalBit"" release. So why not this treatment with Gattaca? I'll stick to my original version, thanks. Barely perceptable increase in video quality simply isn't enough of a draw to dump the documentary extras."
4,Deceptively Deep,"I like this flick. It has a number of unique qualities that make it interesting. At one level, it is a science fiction piece; at another, it's a drama and psychological thriller/study. You have to pay attention to the plot development. It's a movie I like to watch a few times a year, so that says something."
5,Very Realistic Thriller,"Although I am not a big sci-fi fan, I enjoyed this movie immensely. It has a ""1984"" feel to it. The premise of the movie has already happened, i.e., Nazis tried to create a ""perfect"" society, where those deemed undesirable were exterminated. This movie makes you wonder if the future will be consumed with people trying to create perfect human specimens -- especially with the controversy surrounding cloning."
2,(No) more than meets the eye,"I must say I wasn't too optimistic when I rented this movie, but i didn't expect it to be this bad. The production desing is good and the actors are allright, but the script is pretty horrible. For instance, what's that that those guys do in that room tapping computers keyboards ramdomly while watching a pre-rendered 3D animation of a space flight? And how is that we're able to flight really far away in space and have machines that can read the whole ADN map in seconds and we're still unable to cure a broken back? I could go on the 1000 words limit of this review telling all the easily spotting fails of the really weak script but I don't want to spoil the movie to those who hasn't seen it. It's an OK movie to hire on a boring Sunday afternoon or to watch it on cable, but believe me, if you're intelligent enough to notice that Episode I has quite a flop script you'll regret buying this. P.S: The only really good thing is the las of the deleted scenes"
1,"Tame, Lame","I can't believe anyone thinks this movie is good, much less so many people think it is good. I found it painfully boring, trite and almost campy."
1,Crappy movie,Was dissapointed with this one. I let the movie play but couldn't take watching alot of it.
2,A snorefest,I found this movie to be a deadly bore...I had to watch it in a biology classUma Thurman is gorgeous in this film
4,Gattaca,"Uma Thurman is a favorite actress of mine and since this film included her husband at the time Ethan Hawke,I thought it couldn't be a bad movie.The subject line is about a man who always felt inferior and had the opportunity to excel.Sci_Fi at the time,it is becoming plasible at this time.Changing and rearranging DNA always a unique idea and subject too controversy."
1,Avoid the Superbit version of Gattaca!...,"I just picked up Gattaca (Superbit version), and I was extremely disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this film deserves 6 stars if there was such a thing, but the Superbit DVD is absolutely awful. There are no special features, only the movie and captions. No special features means no trailers, notes, commentary, or deleted scenes; just about everything that makes DVDs feel worth buying. Not to sound melodramatic or anything, but I feel so cheated and heart-broken by buying the Superbit version of Gattaca. So this is just a warning to everyone hoping to own this masterpiece on DVD: DO NOT BUY THE SUPERBIT VERSION!... BUY THE REGULAR DVD!... NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE EXTRA FEATURES BUT IT'S ALSO CHEAPER TOO!..."
3,Dark story in a future which may not be that far away,"The story is a newer idea of 'big brother' which, when you come to think of it, may not be that far away. The current DNA insights make this very plausable and quite scary, really.Acting is quite different from the usual (possibly to create a more alienating environment?) but really good.I really enjoyed this movie."
5,"Captivating, inspiring and AWESOME!!!","The story drew me right into the life of the main character and I found myself wanting to be just like Elsie - with such a pure heart and such strong faith! I didn't want to stop reading, and when I finished the book, I wanted the next one in the series right away. I even loved the Foreword to the book which is full of fascinating information about the history and the social customs of the 19th century. This modern version is very well-written and much easier to read than the original 1868 text. The characters really come to life! The book inspired me to want a much closer walk with the Lord!"
5,Elsie's Endless Wait,"The Elsie Dinsmore stories are full of encouragement and hope.My daughter and I have read the first four Elsie Dinsmore A Life ofFaith series by Mission City Press, we laughed and cried our way through little Elsie's life.However, a note to those who are purchasing this series ... the Mission City Press editions are a revised writing of Martha Finley's Elsie Classics. Since purchasing the Mission City Press series I discovered that the stories in these four books are covered in the 1st book of the Original Elsie Classics -- the 1st book is Elsie Dinsmore. If you are wanting the Original Elsie Dinsmore books -- I recommend those published by Cumberland House.Either publication will be a good read for you and your child."
4,Pretty good...,"I got the boxed set of four when I was around 8 or 9. At the time, my mom thought I thought I should read them when I'm a little older. So when i was 11 I read the first two. I liked them a lot. Well, my birthday was a few days ago. It's been awhile sinc ei've read the Elsie books cause I just lost intrest. For my birthday I recieved the Oringinal Elsie Book 1. I personally think I'll the oringinals a lot better, especially since now i'm a lot older. But if you're still a little young, but want to read the Elsie books, tehse one's are better for you. Their dialouge's a lot easier to understand, bigger print, bigger book, etc. But if you're older, read the oringinals."
5,Elsie's Endless Wait,Hi my name is Hollie and I loved this book. I also recommend the whole series of Elsie. They are such great books.The girl lost her mother when she was very very young and her father is away.Well I can't tell any more or I will give away the whole book. You will just have to read it your self.
4,A very good compressed history of the OCPD,"As an OCPD officer myself I found this book to be entertaining and educational. Naturally there were a few stories I thought should have been included that weren't, but for a single book history this book does a very good job of covering the history of the OCPD from its inception right up to the Federal Building Bombing in 1995. It's a must-have for anyone with an interest in the history of Oklahoma City."
2,It's informative but amateurish,"Let me put this delicately. The informational content is there but the production quality is terrible. It will drive you nuts if you are an adult! From the amateurish titles to the monotone drone on the announcer, it will remind you a a early 70s kids classroom teaching video. Get History Channel's ""The Universe"" series or Tom Hank's ""From Here To The Moon"" for a much better productions. If only I could return it for a refund, I would!"
2,Do not judge this book by its cover...,"...because it has nothing to do with the inside. I thought the story was about a cowboy-one of Palmer's infamous Long Tall Texans-it's about a secret agent. When you read the back cover the heroine's name is not the same as the inside.This book was clearly not read by any of the editors at MIRA. There were little inconsistent things throughout the text that drove me absolutely crazy.Pass this book up, and wait for a reprint of one of her older books."
3,The Paper Rose,"the Book is good for older ""inquiering"" minds. with sizaling sex and an adventuras, sad, and happy plot. I recomend it for everyon!( for yonger people adult supervison advised)"
5,Paper Roses~Great Book!,"This book has everything love, heartache, jealousy, murder & redemption. This book is about Tate Winthrop proud Native American that won't consider a relationship with Cecily Blake because he won't have a mixed marriage. Cecily hides a secret that will devastate Tate. As head of Hutton corporations security, ex-mercenary & former CIA agent Tate has been protecting Cecily for years. He saved her as a teenager from an abusive stepfather & has been secretly supporting her for years. When Cecily finds out she leaves school & goes out on her own to became independent of Tate. Don't want to give away to many secrets. If you like Diana Palmer you'll love this book."
1,"Unbelievable, poorly written and boring!","Why the heroine would want the hero in this book is beyond me. Both these people need help from the psychologist that was helping Colby. Not only that ... when Tate finally accepted his birth father, he had a complete change of personality. The details of the whole book were just unbelievable. Save your money."
4,Enjoyable,"I like this book very much. Ms. Palmer takes you into another world the world where only the characters exist and its fun and exciting. Cecily and Tate were very likable and so were the other characters. The things that i didn't like about this book was that Cecily and Tate took too long to get to together. I thought that there was too much Colby in the first half of the book, the story is suppose to be about Tate and Cecily, Even if Colby was very likable. I love Diana Palmers books and one was good. And I like that her heroines are virgins and her heros are tough but tender."
2,predictable,"I expected so much more from Tate-he was predictably bitter and prejudiced. Cecily is a wimp! I have read Ms.Palmer for years and I was disappointed in Tate & Cecily's story. What century does this woman come from? Tate was lukewarm at best, we all knew he would wack off his hair(heaven forbid if we had a long-haired hero). Colby was far more dangerous and had more sex appeal than anyone else in this story! The plot was ""blaaah"". All in all, this story was lacking the magic that Diana Palmer is capable of. Better luck next time."
1,Sorry Miss Palmer,I have been a big fan of Ms. Palmer for a long time and couldn't wait for her books to come out. This is the third book that I have bought in the past 1.5-2 years that have totally disappointed me. I could practically write her books - they are all the same and predictable that the pages that should be exciting aren't. And this book follows the norm. I would like her to write a novel with some surprises in it - a older woman perhaps or maybe a likeable guy.
5,time to get to mixing,"this is one of the best books for this topic, oil recipes and other very helpful ideas to help heal yourself!!!"
4,Easy to use and recommended,The ease of use is perfect for beginners like me. I have a few books on this subject and i would recommend it to others. Good recipes
4,LEARN(ING,"So far I am learning as I go on essential oils. AND I'll continue to learn. It took me awhile to figure out how to get around this book on Kndle Fire. Still am trying. For example, on some recipes, they would list extra essential oils. AND I don't know how you use them in place of the other essential oils. That part is confusing. Other then that, I'll keep learning. :)"
5,great book,"This is a terrific book for those first starting aromatherapy, and I'm sure for those who have experience. The descriptions are clear and easy to understand and follow. The recipes range from A to Z - everything from beauty remedies, muscular aches, headaches - really, everything!"
5,One of my favorite/most used references,"I am very happy with this book. I use it daily with two other essential oil references, which give in-depth descriptions of each essential oil. Ms. Worwood's book tells you best how to use the essential oils to treat common ailments and more. This is a great book for the beginner and reference for the expert."
5,I keep comeing back!,"I was recomended by a pro. to see this book, and I checked it out from my local library. I found myself comeing back to look up more things I could use the oils for - when I had a headache ect. I finaly renewed that copy so much I bought the book!! I love how the book also provides a list of the other oils that can be used as a subtitute and acheave the same results for many conditions. I tried the bug spray - and it worked!!!!!"
5,Excellent book for amateurs and professionals,This book has become my bible in aromatherapy! It has allowed me to incorporate aromatherapy and essential oils in my everyday lifestyle with ease and understanding. It allows the beginner to better understand the joys and pleasures of the natural world and it gives the more experienced the scope to experiment.
5,"Clearly written, handy reference book","Appreciated the indexing and the clearly written approach to the subject. A useful reference and reading for anyone interested in aromatherapy, from beginner to advanced."
2,not scientific,I didn't think it was complete-she has many recipes for different symptoms but does not explain which oil serves what purpose and why they are combined that way. I was more interested in more research-based explanation of the functions for each oil so as to be able to creatively use essential oils.
3,"Good for beginners, but not very complete","Having received this as a gift, I didn't know about it's contents until I read it. This book doesn't include ""essential"" information about the oils in the aromatherapy mixtures, like exactly *why* clary-sage is useful and what exactly it does. That was the information I was looking for, and this book does not have it."
5,You'll use it again and again,"This book is truly packed with information. I use many of the recipes for gardening, health and home. Using her advice for garden pests, I finally got rid of whatever was eating my basil and my sunflowers."
2,Disapointing,Once again a book that seems to promise a lot but just does not seem to deliver- all over disapointing.
3,This book is great but....,I was looking more for a reference guide. It is full of information but I wanted a quick look book not such a must read the entire thing book.
3,Good info,"I am new to the essential oils world and wanted a basic guide to using them. This is good but feels a little bit sophisticated for me. I wanted a quick go to book for basic recipes. This is ok for that, but has a ton more info in it that I am not sure I will use. I don't have a lot of the oils on hand and am not sure how much I am going to get into it. But if and when I do, this will be the book I use."
5,A must have!,"This is one of the best books about Aromatherapy I posess. It explains in a detailed fashion when and how to use the essential oils. It covers almost all, if not all, the essential oils from the most commonly used, like lavender, to the more exotic ones like Hyacinth. It also presents different situations in which they can be used. For example, there is a whole chapter about which oils are most useful while traveling and another about which ones are better for your skin. So I highly recommend it as a guide for better living through aromatherapy."
2,Incomplete!!!,"This is a recipe book for blending essential oils to treat specific illnesses, injuries, or other problems. The book covered 10 oils in limited detail and had no information on many of the oils that are included in the recipes. I was very disappointed and got very little of value from reading this book as I wanted to learn about many different oils and their properties.Here is a much better book and the best one that I have found to date on essential oils:Chemistry Of Essential Oils Made Simple: GOD'S LOVE MANIFEST IN MOLECULES"
5,Incredibly Easy and Interesting to Read,"I have always been interested in aromatherapy but I didn't expect his book to be such good, easy reading. She makes learning about essential oils fun, easy and interesting. I can't wait to receive the essential oils I ordered to try a few of the recipes in this book."
5,Essential Oils,This book is awesome! It has an extensive amount of information.Be sure to get this book if you are interested in essential oils andaromatherapy.
5,Chris Sertzel,The best aromatherapy and essentials reference I have ever purchased- has a specific section for blends and properties as they relate to pets. Would recommend this book for anyone who practices.
3,good starter book,"This is a good starter book on essenttial oils, but it does not give frequencies or how many drops to use at a time. But it has a lot of interesting info on essential oils."
3,Not what I expected,"It wasn't, what I was looking for. A better book is Modern Essentials which not only tells you about the oils but how to use them."
5,Very helpful guide to essential oils,Love this book! I am new to using essential oils and this is a great guide and reference book. Very easy to understand and there are tons of references and recipes for just about anything you could need.
5,Very informative book,"I received this book a couple of days ago and can hardly put it down. It is a wealth of information on the use of essential oils for all sorts of ailments, conditions, household uses, and garden applications."
2,Why I did not buy this book,"This is the book that always comes to the forefront when people look for aromatherapy books. Heck, it was even in my health food store. This book is disjointed, assumes you have oodles of money for 50 plus oils, and gives vague instructions on the way to use these. It may be clear if you already know about this subject. For me, I need a step by step understanding of how to proceed. That is not what you get in this book.For the beginner Kathi Keville is the way to go. (Aromatherapy for Dummies, or Aromatherapy the Complete Guide to the Healing Art)."
1,NOT A GOOD BOOK,"For the author to know so much about aromatherapy, I find it VERY disturbing [to say the least] that she recommends certain oils for cats that are fatal. Anyone with her expertise should have known this. And for this reason alone, I give her only 1 star. I am not an expert, but by doing my own research before starting aromatherapy, I found out about cats how fatal oils can be for them. I hate to think of how many cats became ill or died because of her and I don't even own a cat, just dogs. It just sickens me."
2,This is a book for beginners,I was not satisfied with this book. I thought the information in the book was only helpful if you are new to the subject of essential oils. I passed this book on to a friend who had little knowledge on the subject. If you are new to the subject then you will get some basic information on the subject of essential oils along with some recipes.
3,insufficient information on the oils themselves.,"This is better than many popular works, but, in my opinion falls short in some areas.Ms. Worwood uses geranium in almost every blend. Now, granted, geranium is a useful oil for physical and emotional balance, but she does tend to overdue it a bit.She also really doesn't give quite enough information about the individual oils. A lot of suggestions as to their uses, but if you are trying to research an individual oil, this is not the place to start.I'd also like to see more safety information; she seems to ignore the issue of sensitization.It's not a bad book; but not the be all and end all of aromatherapy information."
2,The Incomplete book of Essential Oils ... For beginners only,"This book covers a basic care kit of 10 oils. It covers these oils well and provides receipes covering many ailments and situations using just this kit. If you are just interested in getting your feet wet in aromatherapy this book is a good one to start with. However if you think you might be interested in going beyond the beginning phase, then this book will not take you there."
2,Not what I thought,This book wasn't what I expected. I wanted homemade cleaning supply recipes made with essential oils along with some of the recipes listed. The book is written in a way that is harder to understand than I expected as well. I wish I would have gotten another one.
5,"MILWAUKEE 7"" GRINDER (6068)","MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS GRINDER/SANDER IS FROM A SUPPORT POSITION WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST CONTRACTORS IN THE U.S. THIS MILWAUKEE GRINDER WAS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS IN OUR PROJECT TOOL TRAILERS FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL IN SCOPE. OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS IN INSPECTING THEM AND REPAIRING THEM, I FOUND THEM TO BE A VERY DURABLE UNIT. THE MOST COMMON REPAIRS CONSISTED OF CLEANING THE UNITS UP, BLOWING OUT THE DIRT, CHANGING THE BRUSHES AND REPLACING CUT CORDS OR DAMAGED PLUGS OR MISSING GUARDS. THE FIELDS, ARMATURES, GEARING ARE REALLY SOLID. THE CASES WILL BREAK IF YOU DROP THEM, AS WITH ANY TOOL. SWITCHES ARE VERY DEPENDABLE. ALWAYS USE THEM WITH A GUARD WHEN GRINDING. THESE ARE MY OPINIONS FROM INSPECTING APPROXIMATELY 100 OF THESE TOOLS, COMING BACK FROM THE PROJECTS."
1,horrible price,"Letters and Sounds 1 costs $5.75 on Abeka's website!!!! Please don't pay this ridiculous price! It also appears to be an outdated copy also, so be careful if you if you choose to buy."
4,fun book,"My 2 yo loves this book. I read to him since he was 1 and now he would pick up this book, flip the pages, and pretend to read by himself."
3,Anger Management for Mr. Herb,"Cute story, but why does Mr. Herb have to get so mad? He left a monkey alone with a ton of ice cream, what did he think was going to happen? He really looked like he was going to lose it. I was also disappointed in the pictures, they seemed like a high school kid's interpretation of Curious George, rather than the usual one. My 2.5 year old still liked it, but it's definitely not the best."
5,Great,The best Leatherman ever. Other brands have dull knives and usless saws the XTi has great blades that can really cut!
5,handy and versatile...,"Excellent construction - allows for a variety of common tasks that can be accomplished immediately (not after 10 minutes looking for the tools, or using a butter knife or worse - ruining your pocket knife or nail clippers!)"
2,Not as good as i thought,"Not after 1/2 month i use this tool the philips bit become deteriorated. The are also misaligmnent on some of the blades. One of the lock are pretty hard to be unlock. It sometimes hurt my thumb to unlock it.Others look great. But i think with current quality it not worth the money paid for this multi-tool. Although it's under warranty but u must spend more money to send it to be repaired/replaced. This also will waste our precious time.My advice if you have other option, go for it."
5,Beautiful Camera,"I highly recommend this camera. It is easy to take everywhere and it have all features needed. I'll buy it again, but i don't need two of them."
2,Over priced!!!! DON'T SPEND $599,"First, I bought this camera about a year ago for $249. Why is is being sold for $599 is beyond me. DON'T SPEND THIS MUCH!!! This camera is average at best. 8.1mp is pointless, I can take a picture on a Canon 7.2mp and it is clearer. This camera breaks easily and takes disapointing pictures. I won't be purchasing a Sony camera again. I assumed that it would be a really good one because of Sony's good reputation, but next time I am going with a company that specializes in cameras. Think Canon or Nikon for a superior camera."
1,buy from another company,"DON'T BUY A CYBERSHOT!!!!!!!!!! I really loved this camera. I bought it to use at work to take pictures and update our website. I loved it so much that I bought one for myself. It was stored in my desk at work and was only used once or twice a month... About 1 year and 3 days after the purchase date, the lcd screen turned white. it just quit working. None of the fixes work. There are hundreds of people saying that this has happened to them with the Cybershot cameras, but since my model number wasn't included in the ""recall"" for free repair, no one will help. Their customer service stinks. I can pay to send it in to them and pay more than I paid for the camera to get it fixed, or I can trash it and start over. It's been almost a year since I bought my personal one. I'm betting it's days are numbered too..."
2,Watch the details,"I was impressed by the value I believed I was receiving over other on-line prices I had found for this camera. When the cameras arrived, they did not include media cards which I assume was part of the reason for the lower price. I find this practive deceptive. When you buy a camera, you assume you are at least being provided what is needed to allow basic functions. I was also promised express delivery on my order due to the amount. Instead of the 2-3 day shipping I was expecting, the order took several days to arrive. I thought I was saving time and money, but probably would have been more satisfied by just going to a local store and purchasing the camera."
2,Good Picture....but Poor stability,"You got to have extremely steady hand, or camera stand to use this camaera.During my niece wedding, I put in a 2GB of memory and we were trigger happy, we must have took over couple hundred of pictures, however, I am very unhappy about the result. 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy, messy, out of focus.On the other hand, for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand, you got a great picture.Size is good, weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size, but to some people that's good quality."
3,Great Daytime Camera - Nighttime Not So Much,"I read a lot about this camera before I purchased it. Apparantly I didn't read enough. All in all it's a great camera. Pretty fast shooting, big LCD, 8.1MP, and easy to use. Shooting at night with the flash leaves something to be desired. The aperature it shoots at when the flash is on, f2.8, is way to wide for shooting in dark with a flash. Which means you'll see a lot of out of focus pictures unless the subject doesn't move much and you get a good focus on them."
1,Short lived enjoyment,"I have just bought the Sony Cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and I have only taken 30-40 pictures, I loved it and then it just stopped working, so I recharged the baterry, no luck still the camera wouldn't turn off or on. So Thankfully I had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again. No it doesn't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off. Basically worthless. It seems like it might have short circuited. But I was so excitted to buy this camera I read all instructions before use, I haven't let anyone else use it and it hasn't been out of my sight, never been dropped, never in extreme hot or cold, always well protected. SO I am going to try to return it or exchange it. I am hoping to get good service or I will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures. Hopefully I can let you know if they stand by their products. Before now I have always been happy with what I have bought from Amazon"
1,Shame on Sony,I was looking for a point and shoot camera when I bought this one. I thought I couldn't go wrong with buying Sony. I took this camera to a wedding and all the pictures came out very dark. I tried using different setting with no success. Half of the pictures came out blurry. The lag time is really long. I missed a lot of good shots. I returned this camera and bought Canon. I love it.
2,"cute but small, not worth the price","This looks big in the picture trust me it is samll. Appears open in the back for alot of utensils, but the opening cannot hold more than 5 untensils."
3,Painfully sluggish adaptation,"Having just read the book on which this movie is based - Rogue Male, still in print - I was quite disappointed by the movie's painfully slow pace. The book is a marvel of breathless storytelling - a first-person account of a man on the run, pursued from the Continent to London to the English countryside, with only his wits to rely on as Nazi agents relentlessly zero in. It's a real ""man hunt."" But the movie, alas, over-emphasizes the book's minimal love story and downplays the countryside scenes - perhaps necessary, given the genre and times. Still, despite a few too many yawns, the movie is clearly Lang's. There are some wonderful night scenes, dramatically lit, and the scene in the London tube station is gripping. Bottom line: This is worth checking out as a rarely seen Lang film, but my advice is don't expect too much. Best is to run, don't walk, to read the book. It is, John le Carre has stated, a major source and inspiration for the thriller genre as a whole."
5,Movie review,This was a good movie. Being made in black and white really adds to the suspense. It kept you on the edge of your seat with an unusual ending.
3,Dated hunt.,"I remember Man Hunt from when it first appeared many decades ago and recall it being a taut thriller. The cast is, of course, very good. But it now all seems so dated, in a Hollywood sense. The story line just does not hang together. The escape and pursuit lack continuity. The ending is staged. I'm not sure what the moral of the story is. Would Pigeon's popping of the Fuhrer been execution or murder? (Oh, yes, we know now what a good thing that could of been, but the movie's setting is pre-war.) I'm glad to have seen it again. But that's the last time."
1,Worthless,"This is a cutsie little map with VERY little useful information.Only five or six limited areas of L.A. are shown in map form.If you expect to use this map to find your way around L.A., forget it."
3,Okay for people who already know LA,"We purchased this map to serve as a short-cut guide for some visitors from Paris. Because of its disjointedness, it is a bit confusing. I am not sure anyone could have mapped Los Angeles in this manner anyway. I have used some of the other Map Easy guides for other cities, and they seem to be much clearer and easy to follow."
2,Not quite as expected,It was a OK book. Not as thorough as I though it would be. You can probably pass the test without this book. I did.
1,AWFUL DISPLAY,"The title says it all - the display is pretty much illegible under day time or night conditions - you can adjust the contrast, but this only helps a little and the best contrast setting varies depending if you use the back light or not, or what the ambient light conditions are. So you have to enter the set up and change the contrast a lot, and it is still hard to read after playing with this adjustment. Worse display ever. Also, no real built in mic, so you either use earphones or hang this ""thing"" around your neck (the supplied portable speaker). What would be nice is an audible built in speaker so you could hold it up to your ear and hear the phrase pronounced, and then try speaking it yourself. Handwriting recognition was also terrible. I don't know how folks can say this is a good product - I guess its a matter of perspective."
5,German/English translator,"I highly recommend this product. This is more detailed then your usual translator. Lots of features including human pronunciation of phrases with a self amplified loudspeaker that is easy to take on vacation. It is also a organizer, address book, calculator among numerous other features."
1,wrong product for us,according the online manual is it possible to change the operational language to german but it is not possible out of this we are very unhappy with this product!
1,The temperature read out lies,"Got this item yesterday and plugged it in. Was very impressed at first. The temperature indicator was showing rapid temperature decrease finally down to 45 degrees. This was inside a 78 degree home. Ok, I then put a thermometer inside the unit and closed it up for an hour. The external display showed 41 but the thermometer I placed inside was showing 52. This is all done inside a 78 degree home. I'm more inclined to believe my thermometer then the display. I placed 3 chilled 16oz water bottles inside and left them overnight. Took them out in the morning and they where cool, but not cold. The 32 degree claim on the box is pure puffery in my opinion. The 40-45 degree drop from ambient temperature is also was not confirmed in my test. I'm returning this unit. It isn't going to 'cool' anything to near the advertised claims."
1,Wimpy little portable fridge with AUTO PLUG ONLY,"I know I was not the only one to be misled by the product discription, and when I contacted the seller about the 'missing wall plug' all I got was the runaround. Be aware this item only comes with the auto-plug feature, the optional wall plug is only if you buy it seperately, that is, if you can find it.The fridge comes with a temperature display that has never worked, the cup holder is a cheap, roughly hewn soda-can holder that flips open akwardly from the top of the front panel.I have also found the fridge to be miserably under-powered. ALL it will do is lower the ambient temperature of the room slightly, and if you place items in the fridge that aren't pre-chilled, you're wasting your time if the mini-fridge isn't kept in a briskly-chilled room or car.If ever I was to regret a purchase, this is definitely it.To note, I have not tried using the warming feature."
3,Works OK,"Product works OK if you plug in the empty cooler the night before you want to use it. Then put in the COLD beverages, cold fruit, etc immediately before you are ready to go. In that case, the cooler will keep your food cold. To do this, buy the 110/12V adapter, so you can plug the cooler in at home the night before. Then when you get to the hotel or whatever the next night, plug the cooler into the wall and let it run all night. If you do these things, the cooler will meet your expectations. If you are not prepared to do this, better use the old fashion ice cooler."
2,Ok for drinks!,"The frig arrived in perfect condition and looks very nice. It however doesn't keep contents with in refrigerator safe zone even with ambient air of 64 degrees. I was hoping it would do a little better than just 15 degree cooling power. It's also a pain to have to keep remembering to unplug it BEFORE you restart your vehicle every time you stop. All in all, I'd say it's of limited use."
2,Wagan moble fridge and warmer,"This product does work and it does what it says it does. However, a cooler works much better and is cheaper. The heater function does work. I don't use this anymore and actually am selling it because I use my lunch box more."
3,automobile cooler - warmer,Haven't actually used unit as yet. Willing to pay extra (sm.amt.) if itcame with 110 adapter included in basic unit. Have questions whether coolercan be used with ice. Would like to know!!! Think all will be fine.
4,I still like Clementi better,"I don't know what it is, but these sonatinas aren't as melodious as the well-known 6 sonatinas by Clementi.If you are looking for protypical sonatinas, you might be disappointed. Each sontaina consists of only two movements, the second movement being a minuet or rondo. Moreover, the fourth sonatina is the only one with a second theme in a related key. The other first movements lean more toward the AABA form.All the same, this work provides for a pleasant sightreading exercise."
4,"This is a Christmas present for my sister. Once she reads it, I'll let you know what she thinks of it. Just so glad you had it","This is the only one in the series that my Sister is missing in her collection. Once she reads it, I'll let you know what she thinks of it. She loves the series so that is why I picked the rating I did. I know she'll love it. I would recommend this book and any in the series for mystery."
4,Grabs you attention and doesn't let it go,"I picked up this book and did not put it down, I finished it in a little over a week.It is set in Washington and really describes DC and is a classic old fashioned murder mystery. It is very suspenseful and keeps the reader interested. READ IT!! It is really good."
3,Sparse information,Goldsmith throughout all his works stresses the importance of meditation as the superior method to entering reality. But he does not provide many details as to how to meditate. If you have not read any of the authors other books it might be better to start with Living The Infinite Way. If you are looking for books on meditation you might want to examine Thomas Merton (Christian) or Hazrat Inayat Khan (Sufi) for instance.
3,still have not read it,"motivation to read something like it? hmm not in me... seems like it would be good, bought it on a whim"
3,Meditation for the metaphysical christian?,"Not for the orthodox christian. Mr. Goldsmith preaches more about his views on the ""Infinite Way""; rather than offer dialog or composition to the practice of meditation. The book is more metaphysical idealogy then christian theology, although the author attempts to merge christian faith with metaphysicial idealogy.The title should be: ""Meditations of the Infinite Way."""
3,"Okay, if you're a christian....","This book is for the christian, so a little hard to swallow for those of us who seek spirituality in a different context. I can only stomach so many 'thy's', 'thou's', and 'thee's'. This book is full of scripture and the author himself begins to ramble on in 'thy's, thou's and thee's'. Yuck! I have to say that before he ravaged on with scripture, I found some inspiration in parts of the book (which I'm not too sure I can handle finishing)."
2,More religious than I was expecting,"The writing style has proven to be a bit confusing in my opinion. On top of that, the constant reinforcement that meditation is tied exclusively to communing with God is a bit off putting. There is no mention of how meditation is used in other traditions (eastern schools of thought) and seems to be portrayed as strictly a Judeo-Christian concept is limiting."
4,niceeeeeeee,this is a beautiful citrus smell. i would call it elegantly citrus. reminds me of one of the Victoria Secret bombshell fragrances. i really like this. the perfume was well packaged and protected. and as always received quickly! thanks Amazon!
1,Poor quality,"My girlfriend used to have the same perfume and she loves it. But she didn't like the one I ordered here. It doesn't last long, the smell of perfume dissapeared in an hour. Seems like a poor quality item."
1,Not the real thing,If you go to buy this perfume at any other store it is a light purple color as it is in the picture. The bottle I got was clear with mold on top of it. I returned it and recieved a new bottle in the same condition. You have to go to Nordy's to buy the real deal.
3,Its alright.,"Hi, your service is very good, i admit that, it took a little bit long to come,but i guess its bc its far. the product came all in original package, but i thought that eau de parfum will stay long and the smell last long. I had this before and i love the smell is stays on for so long. the next week i can even smell it on my cloths but this one, its goes alway in 5 min and the smell become a uneasy smell, like a skunk."
1,Bad perfume,"I received this order, along with two other fragrances. When I first sprayed myself with the perfume it was lovely. However, the next time I sprayed it on it had a very strange odor and was terrible. I have had to throw it out because the smell of it is quite bad. It completely changed and I should have returned this item and received a refund. What can I do about this?>? I will never order fragrance from Amazon again. Out of the three fragrances I ordered only ONE of them was good. Never, never again."
1,No Scent?,"I guess I must have gotten a bad bottle. I can not smell it at all, as well as my Husband, Daughter & Son? As much as I LOVE perfumes...I am VERY disappointed, and now reading reviews that this is also an imitation that I purchsed and CAN NOT get a refund or exchange.I will be more careful about buying perfume via Amazon next time."
4,one great album;one bad album sandwiched together,come on down is exquisite to my jazz tastes. it has dynamism and bluegrass/hoedown rythym that makes it immediately appealing and exciting. the reason i'm talking s..t is useless and not playable. it was a finger up to his record contract legal larceny and he responded in like kind. i found buying and owning this mismatch satisfying and play come on down as much as lee morgan or any other great music.
1,Eddie's in a bad humor,"Avoid this release. Disc one: ""Come On Down!"" is mediocre funk jazz. Disc two: ""The Reason Why I'm Talking S--t"" is the most tasteless, stupid crap I've ever heard. Evidently it was Eddie Harris's attempt at a comedy record, but the only funny thing about it is that Atlantic released it in 1976 and Collectables dusted it off and tried to hoodwink the public again in 2006. It's jaw dropping. Some people can handle this sort of material but Eddie Harris isn't one of them. I was tempted to toss it into the garbage can. Do your ears a favor and scroll past this."
1,nasty,this is a pill you do not want a chalky garlic taste it was not great dont buy wasted monies horrible pick whoever invented this one no way
2,Horrible taste!,"I've been taking this garlic supplement as part of Tim Ferris's recommended PAGG stack as well... 1 pill four times a day. I haven't noticed any smell (and my wife hasn't said anything either) but good lord-- the taste is SO strong and bad! I love garlic in my food, but this is super concentrated, and I have to force it down every time. I wish it had a coating of something tastier, like Advil has that sweet brownish coating."
1,Horrible,I got this kit for my audi a4 b5 and it makes performance worse! believe it or not this intake kit makes your performance worse simply because the air filter is in the open and its sucking up all the hot air thats coming from inches away which is the exhaust manifold. the exhaust is inches away from the intake causing it to suck in extremely hot air hence decreasing performance... save your self the trouble and just stick with the stock intake
2,"""Michael Jackson's Best Performances""","Michael Jackson / The King of PopThe product cover and title were misleading. I bought this product believing that it contains Michael Jackson's stage performances. The DVD, however, carries just one live-performance song and rest of the DVD comprises of Michael Jackson's music videos (all of which is already available with me, as part of other MJ Albums, Collections).The quality of recording is not upto the mark. The packaging does not give it a factory-produced DVD look and feel."
3,Surprisingly Good Rendition,"I bought this cd on a whim because it was on super sale, but little did I know that it would prove to be a wonderful addition to my musical theatre collection.The orchestrations are exquisite and Gail Bartell is a strong Evita. She has both the powerful voice for the mid ranged belting, strong mix for the higher parts in ""Buenos Aires"" ""A New Argentina"" and ""Rainbow High"" and a delicate soprano for ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina."" She does very well with the belting/mixing of ""A New Argentina.""A personal favorite is their rendition of ""Waltz for Eva and Che sung by Bartell and David Chenault as Che.Sure Bartell and Chenualt don't top LuPone and Patinkin's vocal flair, but they fare very well with the material none the less."
1,Not worth five dollars,Recently I have been buying some Harry Potter games for my wife. She has loved all of them because of the ability to explore the castle and be part of the story. (Who hasn't thought it would be cool to be a wizard right?) We bought this game thinking it would be really fun like the other Harry Potter games but we were very disappointed. It becomes very repetitive very quickly. The camera is in a locked position and does not allow you to feel like you're in the game. It's like a really lame version of Gauntlet Legends. The AI are horrendous but are necessary for some of the missions. The game does not follow the book or movie very closely. Altogether it's not worth getting.
2,Goblet of Fire is a disappointment,"The Harry Potter games just got better and better with each new release - until The Goblet of Fire - when the standard went into rapid reverse. Prisoner of Azkeban was suberb and expectations were high for the Goblet of Fire. What a let down ! The camera angle is limited and irritating in the extreme. There is very little interaction with the other characters and you can't explore the school that we have now become so familar with. The flying experience, speeding ahead of the dragon, is from a bygone era compared to the Hippogriff flying in the Prisoner of Azkeban. I just wish that E.A. games has stuck with the winning formula they had. I had hoped for this to be even better in the new game. More of the same would have been so much better than this step backwards."
2,Very Disappointing,"Once again we have a game with loads of work done on flashy graphics but terrible gameplay - immediately obvious from the beginning.If you're buying this for PC you will need specs at least 4x the recommendation. I have a PC at least twice as powerful as required but this game plays with horrible delay. Clearly the developers only tested on supercomputers.Add this to far too many cut scenes and menus, and some tedium about collecting cards and you have a pretty dull game."
3,ok but kinda boring,i thought this game was kinda boring and that it could have been much better it is also very confusing
5,A major poetic voice,"Kelle Groom is a poet's poet, and this new collection of her work is rich in many ways. ""Underwater City"" marks Kelle Groom's emergence as a major poetic voice."
4,Great saw but REPLACEMENT CHAIN is a prob,"is the Makita 791172-9 replacement chain the same as the oregon 12""'er? why put a wrong size chain on? and why is their not a reasonable priced one on amazon. I think they may have taken the que from the ink cartridge shenanigans..."
3,Broke the blade,"Took this knife on a backpacking trip into the white mountains. I was using it to cut brush and clear a camp site. a 1/8"" chunk broke off the cutting edge of the blade. It still works, and seems like a great sharp knife. I guess I went a little too heavy for a knife of this calibur."
4,Schrade X Timer camp knife,"Knife arrived in good condition. It was sharp and ready for use. The knife is very light making it easy to carry. The sheath holds the knife snug and secure but you have to be careful when drawing the blade. A little thicker blade and heft would have been nice but overall, it's a good general purpose camp knife."
2,Counterproductive,"This is the most infuriating device I have ever bought. With cast iron cookware it broils like a champ. With the purpose-built covered pan it will not even boil water reliably. Really! Boiling water is just impossible some days no matter the pot. It is the Vista of cookers, willful and disobedient."
5,PRODUCT IS UNDER-RATED!!!,Just purchased this product on a whim...always curious to see how gadgets work in the kitchen! This one really lived up to my expectations!!! Heats up the pan in only seconds and uses a fraction of the energy. I was able to control the heat precisely from hot to warm at the touch of a button. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who does any cooking at all (even boiling eggs is easier)!
2,"1 died in a month, the replacement was dead on arrival.","While the product and the technology work better than some say, this unit has been having QC problems lately.One I bought a few years ago lasted 2 years.When it died a couple of months ago I bought a replacement here, it died within a month.The replacement unit I ordered here was dead on arrival.I am now trying a different brand instead. I'll let you know how that works out.I will say that an old flat top max burton unit from 4 years ago is still working despite extensive cracks in the cooking surface!(Not safe, don't try this at home!)"
4,"A pretty good book, but not for very young children","I like to do science experiments with my grandson who is 6, and he loves them, so I try to find easy things to do for him. I was hoping this book would be better suited to our needs, but I feel like it is for older children 10 or 11 and up."
4,Stimulating a child mind,"My nephew is 10 years old and I wanted to give him something that takes his attention away from video games. This book has work so far, the author makes the experiments simple enough so that kids can read and understand the concepts. At the same time the experiments can be done with stuff that you find at home. I'm glad with the book and satisfy with my purchase."
1,Misreads feminist standpoint theory,"This book completely misreads feminist standpoint theory and distorts it to serve the author's own interests. The major thinkers in feminist standpoint theory -- Sandra Harding, Dorothy Smith, Patricia Hill Collins, and Nancy Hartsock -- address Hekman's misreading of standpoint theory in the journal, Signs. Someone who misreads standpoint theory should not publish a book on it."
2,NO MENTION OF 3 MILLION POLISH CATHOLICS KILLED,"The author makes a good effort to be objective, but drops the ball here and there. The biggest blunder seems to be in the summary of holocaust casualties. The author left out the fact that 3 Million Polish-Catholics were butchered by Hitler. This fact is often forgotten, and very hurtful, especially to the Poles who lost someone in the Polish holocaust or ""Forgotten Holocaust."". A great book to read is Richard Lukas' ""The Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles Under nazi Occupation."""
5,Should be required reading for all youth,should be required reading for all youth - lest we forget what happens when government gets out of control - as it is doing today!
4,What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger,"Surviving Hitler is a book that describes the very vivid and sickening details of the accounts during the Holocaust that Jack Mandelbaum faced. From being covered in lice every time he laid his head to sleep to being beaten by Nazi soldiers and the constant fear of death and eternal separation from his family, this is Jack's account of how he survived during such an awful time in history. However it tells another story as well about Jack's consistent bravery and will to survive despite all odds in hopes of one day being reunited with his family. This story is a short, easy chapter book read. I would definitely recommend Surviving Hitler to use in the classroom because the reality of his testimony will powerfully impact any reader. Throughout the book are very dismal pictures of the camp and horrors they faced while prisoners under Hitler's regime."
4,Book on Survival,"I think this book was well done for younger readers, learning about this terrible period in life.It is however, a monstrous topic and I would advise to read with caution, but to read, nevertheless, as history must be told."
4,Suriving in The Camps with Alot of Courage,The boy in this book was just an ordinary Polish Boy until 1939when the war started. He was a few of the camp in World War 2.He surived and started a new life in America after a few years.
5,Great- from a teacher's view point,"I teach 4th grade and believe in being honest with my kids. In order to understand the world they live in, they need to understand past events. History has a way of repeating itself. My kids were very interested in the this aspect of WWII after reading Number the Stars. This biography is a neat tie-in to the historical fictional piece."
5,Not that long ago,"Surviving Hitler is a must read for students starting in 5th or 6th grade and up. The reader follows a young boy named Jack through the start of WWII. He is ripped from his happy home in Poland at the ripe age of twelve, and put through things that no one is this lifetime can imagine. The hardships Jack endured, never broke his spirit or desire for survival, so that he could one day reunite with his family. He was sent from concentration camp to concentration camp and yet he remained as positive as possible thriving on his memories. The ending offers a clear picture of how WWII affected families from many different countries. This book will touch anyone's heart as they sympathize with Jack. It will also remind students of how easy it is to go from simple discrimination, to a complete lack of humanity. Valuable discussions, emotions, and connections to history can be made by reading this book."
2,It's PLASTIC!!!,"The fan is fine, but from all the pictures, the text, and the price, you would think it was made of formed plywood (think Eames). But NO. The fan blades are molded plastic painted to look like wood. They did a nice job with the painting, but it's still plastic.On opening the box, I felt I'd been tricked."
2,An amateurish classic rock album debut,"Black And White World's self-titled debut is a mostly bland recreation of 70's classic funk rock. There's nothing overly modern or creative being explored here, with most of the tracks just meandering along. The one good song on the album, ""Love Is the Law"", also happens to be the most driven and catchy with subtle punk nuances that would foreshadow the bands heavier, more grunge-influenced direction with their follow up album 'Life Explodes'.I wouldn't call this a bad album, especially if classic/funk rock is the kind of music you like. It's just, for the most part, boring to listen to."
2,OK,"I found this book average. There are a lot of Photoshop books on the market and this one didn't really stand out in any way. I totally agree with the person that called this book flaky. I don't think a book should tell you you're getting images on a website or CD and then just not include them. That's not very professional.""Great Creative Title""? Not quite."
3,Good PDA - shame about the connectivity,"I have used PDAs for a few years, starting with a basic Palm 100. I received my Sony Clie as a gift for Christmas 2002. During the first year, the cable started to fail to charge up the device and I sent it away to the Sony workshop. It was fixed on the second attempt under warranty (apparently it needed welding and I was not impressed with the service). However, the same fault has recurred and I gave up and bought another PDA, chancing another Sony with a 2-year guarantee. Guess what? The new cable charges up the old PDA no problem. Also, I wonder if anyone else has a problem with displaying pictures from a Sony memory stick - my PDA shows a pixillated mess!"
4,faulty cord?,"I love my Clie, but I had exactly the same problems with the power hovering around 50% to 60% after leaving it to charge overnight.Turns out it's not the battery (at least, not for my machine), it's the Sony cable. I got a new USB cable from someone on eBay, and it fixed all of my battery woes. The new cable fits tightly into the connector, and now the Clie takes a full charge again."
4,9 out of 10!!! marvelous!,"i bought this last christmas and it is wonderful, high resolution graphics, digital camera add on, powerful processor,great organizing features,why pay [$$$] more for a palm brand...i think sont will be taking over the palm market soon.MY ONLY GRIPES: NO INTEGRATED MP3 PLAYER.IT USES MEMORY STICKS, NOT FLASH."
2,BE CAREFUL,"if you own a palm pda and want to transfer all your programs and files to the sony clie be careful. unless you are a computer geek which i am not, while the programs do transfer some are not quite compatible with the sony and when you access some of the programs in sony you will get a fatal error. sony's answer is to delete these programs and there might be some you really want. dont know if it is worth it. the sony would be a great first pda if you want to transfer only the date book and address book."
3,Game is eh okay...,"This game was a great disappointment, it's nothing like the pc version which was great! With in the second day of me playing this game on my xbox 360 i hated it!pros:GraphicsSoundsModernSome VehiclesCons:Multiplayer (Servers suck, and on average of one or three games will actually be open, meaning not many people play this game online any-moreNo Jets (like the PC version they have jets)Too Bold (Game isn't very interactive with its environment)Not even close to PC versionLaggyWell that's about it, overall i would not recommend this game to anyone who has played it on the PC because it is nothing close to what that version has to offer."
4,Great Mulitplayer FUn,"This game is really cool online. The single player function isn't really that great but does pass the time. Online however, will provide for hours and hours of great gaming. Imagine driving a jeep with a buddy of yours on the back, using the .50 caliber machine gun and instructing you where the next enemy is!! All while communicating through the xbox headset. So cool!Tanks, Choppers, and even snowmobiles.....control everything and blow it all up at the same time!! wooooo hooo!"
3,Difficult,"For those never-sleeping gamerpoint seekers steer clear of this title, the acheivements are difficult to take advantage of, aside from this and the very average single player, is the multiplayer, a strong cast of both classes and weapons are represented beautifully on several maps which can supply hours of entertainment as you increase your level (colonel, sargeant etc.). The weak campaign is only partially redeemed by the intense multiplayer combat, veterans of the past battlefield titles should thoroughly enjoy this new addition but I reccomend renting the game prior to buying it, well it doesn't really matter considering the game is 20 dollars, overall I reccomend this to veterans of battlefield, fans of FPS's and people interested in a challenge."
1,Yuk,was not what I expected. it does not have any resemblance to PC version of Battlefield 2 of which I wanted. this K was a big disappointment
5,games games,my husband and boys love this game another game that they enjoy together and the time they spend playing it
2,Battlefield 2 Modern Combat,I bought this game the other day and really wanted to take it online. But when I went to the online protion of the game my xbox couldn't connect to the EA servers. Since the game offers no split screen multiplayer at all it will be collecting dust while I play other games that actually work online. The single player is okay. Many times you end of dying after about a minute. Seeing as how the multiplayer is half of this game I give it a 2/5
1,Do not buy,This game should not be allowed to have the battlefield name. It is nothing but a garbage attempt to cash in on the battlefield name. They dont even update the game and has yet to have a map pack.
2,BORING!...DON'T BUY IT,"THERE IS NO STORY LINE WHAT SO EVER. THE GAME PLAY SUCKS! THE GRAPHICS ARE OKAY. YOUR MUCH BETTER OFF BUYING GHOST RECON ADVANCE 2, OR FEAR. THIS ONE WILL LEAVE YOU BORED QUICK."
2,hm.....ok,ok this game is some what fun but very very hard i made it to master sgt and like the 7th level and anther reason sucky guns i do recomened cod 4 or cod5 and cod 6 when it comes out
4,WTF over,This games great except for the fact that its only one player per console. So if your looking to have your buddies over to play a good shooter this isn't the game for you. Still a fun game though.
1,HORRIBLE!,"I'm just going to sum up how horrible this game is in a coulple of sentances. Bad campaign,bad guns, and when your on live play you run all of the way across the map before you see someone and you usually get killed. the only thing that is remotly fun about this game are the vehicles. Don't wast your money on this crappy game."
4,Battlefield 2 Low Down,A candid game that I must admit has excellent online play that can equally compete with the grand daddy of FPS's on PC; Counterstrike. It even does a nice job at going head to head with Halo 2 but it still has some things to be desired.PRO's+Fantastic Graphics+Good Controls+Diverse Campaign mode+Thrilling Online play+Easy to learn controlsCON's-Not many game variants availible online-Varying load times that can take quite awhile-Uneven teams constantly-Daunting maps that give one side the leading edge-Vehicle controls are clunky-Air vehicles control difficultly and near impossible to destroy online.
1,This book used to be helpful to save you money,"Edmunds blew it. They changed the format of this price guide. This book used to provide the DEALER price of each vehicle and option, which I found very helpful. Now all you get is the price range for the vehicle. They don't even list each option, let alone price it. Oh sure, they give safety data, & technical specs, but everyone knows the only reason you buy this book is to learn what the dealer costs are. I don't want a research book on the vehicle, I want info to save me money when I haggle with the dealer. That money saving info is no longer there, so why buy the book?"
1,not worth the paper it's printed on,"I was very disappointed when this book arrived. I have used several different Edmunds books in the past, and they were very useful as they used to list the cost of each option separately (dealer cost vs. MSRP). It was a quick all-in-one reference that was useful for comparing many cars quickly. This new format only gives a range of the MSRP prices with the same review as is on-line. This book is a complete waste of money!!!!"
2,Something must be left out....,"This cookbook looked like it was going to a good one, but I made a couple of the recipes, and obviously mama dip is leaving out some ingrediants so that it isnt like her restaurant food because the recipes were horrible... I can see that I am going to have to make the dihes... and then figure out how i can make them the correct way by adding some other ingrediants! so this is more of a guide... not a cookbook... it will steer you in the direction of a failiar recipe... then you add your own ingrediants!"
4,Mama Dip's Kitchen,"I love to cook and as a cook, I love people who enjoy cooking as well. I feel like I know Mama Dip. I love this cookbook!!"
5,I LOVE THIS COOK BOOK!!!,"Mama Dip cook book is helping me improve my cooking skills. The recipes are so easy to follow and some of the recipes that my mother cooked or baked when I was small, I remember now after seeing them in the book... I CAN COOK/BAKE ALL OF IT NOW!! I have let all of my friends look at this cook book and all of them have purchased them one and now I getting ready to get her Family cook book that's out.Thanks and Praises go to Mama Dip.. Mrs. Mildred Council..."
5,Mama Dip's Kitchen,"I was born and raised ""country"" cannot wait to cook every darn recipe in this wonderful cookbook!"
2,Not what I was expecting.,"Nice story. But the recipes are too simple and seem incomplete. I've made too many bad recipes from this book and am tossing it.The chicken and dumplings recipe tasted bland. There were no spices listed or mention of salt and pepper. No mention of onions, carrots, etc. The ""best ever"" six flavor pound cake was heavy and not that great because there was no baking soda or powder listed. And I refuse to cook with a bottle of ketchup, cans of cream of chicken soup, and cake mixes, so a lot of these recipes weren't appetizing to me. Oh well."
4,I LOVE SOUL FOOD,"I've been eating/cooking soul food for almost my whole life and I thought i've tasted everything but there is an actual ""Soul Food Seasoning out now called Annabelle's Soul Food Seasoning... It gives that down-home southern cooking taste that you just hope you get close to when you cook soul food. So if you buy this book buy Annabelle's seasoning too it's also sold on Amazon--- it will take EVERYTHING to the next level... From one soul food cook to another... Thats a promiseGod Bless"
2,Recipes,Not really what I thought it would be. The recipes are basic and can be located in less expensivecook books
2,Dissappointed,I had to do alot of improvising for alot of the receipes in this book. Good thing I know already how to cook soul food. I wouldn't recommend this book for a first time soul food cook.
3,Hope the book is better than the restaurant,"If you enjoy sub-standard food prepared by unskilled labor and served at high prices(higher than what other similar restaurants charge), then this book might help you duplicate the Mama Dip's restaurant experience. I've eaten at the namesake establishment several times and always left feeling ripped off and disappointed. I'll give the book 3 stars just for the benefit of the doubt."
4,Big tool for big jobs,"The 6078 grinder/sander with a 9"" grinding wheel is a force to be respected! I've used it to clean up welds, cut metal, sand and also to buff out a boat hull. This is a heavy tool, you will feel your arms at the end of the day! Its weight along with the centrifical force generated by the 9"" wheel work together to steady the cut. The variable speed comes in handy to match the tool to the job."
1,Great tool until you need a switch,"We really liked the older version of this grinder #6068 - until the switch broke. Milwaukee switches are their Achilles heel, most of the Milwaukee tools we use at our construction company lose 1 or 2 switches during their lifetime, we just replace the part. The switch for our grinder is ""obsolete"" I tried dealers, the web and Milwaukee's hotline but no one can supply one. So we have this great tool that is useless. Since we need a grinder I guess I have to buy another one - The Makita GA7011C looks great."
3,Milwaukee 6078 sander / grinder,"It is a professional seems high quality for heavy usage. tool to me feels very heavy.up on arrival it was useless to me because had no accessory to practice polishing or grinding,I purchased a buffing wheel but no nut came with the tool to fasten wheels.I sent this item back primarily for the weight it did not seem effortless to polish a vehicle wile supporting the weight of the tool. but I did not try so I am not sure.Con: no accessory included.Pro: I am not sure"
4,Mr. Consistent,"John Renbourn is one of those few performers who has never put out even a mediocre, much less poor, solo album. It helps that he is one of the best finger-pickers now active, but more than this, his is a style of play that is so fresh and vibrant that his treatment of just about any material that might come to hand cannot help but please the ear. On this basis I'm not sure that I would call this the ""definitive"" Transatlantic years collection, as one could easily come up with a second program of equal length that is nearly, if not entirely, as good. But then again, this is not exactly *bad* news, is it? The real choice is whether you want to go with such compilations, or stick with the individual albums. Tough choice, except possibly to the extent that the compilations often have considerably longer programs."
2,DVD features: good Content: Poor,"I bought this DVD because I found Super Bowl XXXII to be one of the best football games I'd seen in a long time, and I wanted to watch it again with high video and audio quality. Instead I found a run-of-the-mill NFL Highlights film that's maybe 25 minutes long. It does absolutely no justice to the real game. Yes, some plays can be seen from multiple angles. Yes you can choose to hear play-by-play from the Denver or Green Bay announcers, but only occasionally - what you listen to mostly is hyberbole from the NFL narrator. Finally, this DVD demonstrates a dark side of DVD's: when you pop the DVD in, you are immediately subject to a 3 minute advertisement for RCA - WHICH CANNOT BE SKIPPED. All DVD controls are disabled for the duration of this advertisement. And if you watch the highlights film to the end, you'll get to watch the advertisement again, whether you want to or not! This DVD should have cost 2.99, not 20.99."
5,For jazz enthusiasts,"The Visit a new compelling drama by director Jordan-Pearlman starring Billie Dee Williams and Hill Harper. The soundtrack is a stunning collection of Jazz and Gospel. For jazz enthusiasts and all around music lovers this assortment of songs is as compelling and as emotionally charged as the film. With songs by Nnenna Freelon, Joe Sample, Lalah Hathaway, Wallace Roney, Ramsey Louis and Joe Williams, the album is a true sonic compliment to the on screen performances."
5,As good as the movie,"This soundtrack is amazing, the movie is amazing, both worth the purchase. The mix of this soundtrack is really cool and for me all of the music blew me away."
1,Ashamed,"This has the worst sound quality of any commercial recording I've ever bought, and I've been buying for over 50 years. The sellers should be ashamed."
4,Maddness of Crowds,"How many millions of words have been written about the mass psychosis that afflicted the investment and technology worlds at the end of the century will have to be counted by others, however, you will gain a better understanding of how and why that period happened by reading Tom Evslin's novel than by reading any articles or essays. I guess you had to be there to understand the sick joke that was played on all of us that came to be known as the bubble. Tom Evslin was there and Hackoff.com is a fun way to read about it."
5,Excellent Printer Cable,"This is an excellent printer cable. I have had no negative issues with it during any of my printing. Before ordering, just be sure to check out the method of attachment to your printer. For example, does your printer secure the cable by having clips on it or does your printer need the securing clips made on the end of the printer cable.I hope this helps you in your decision.Thanks,Larry Baker"
3,are these green?,"Well after 6 months or so of cold washing these sheets with special 'darks' detergent, I was finally asked by someone if these sheets were dark, dark green, or black. Better than grey I guess."
5,This Is How You Do It,"Character development is quickly becoming a lost art. It seems publishers are following formulas (you basically have the same story written but you change the location and names and go for it) and more authors don't want to take the time to learn the craft.If you are truly interested in learning about Character development, Characters Make Your Story is an excellent place to begin. This older title steps you through the what, how and why of character development and is the best book I've read on the topic (and I've read quite a few)."
4,Makita UC 3500 compared to older Makita chainsaw,This is the second Makita chainsaw I have owned ( the first I have had for 12 years). The uc 3500 has better balance and is ligher making it less tiring to use for long peroids of time. I use the saw mostly to cut firewood for my shop It has less torque than the older saw but is more than adquate for most job.
5,Very good chainsaw,"This chainsaw is an excellent product. We reduced a 70ft iron wood tree to a 15 ft ironwood tree in one afternoon - all the tidy up done. We replaced a poulan 2-cycle chainsaw and the difference is marked. This one is light, easy to use and the only time the chain jumped off was when it was pinched awkwardly by a branch moving in an unanticipated way. We are very happy."
5,handy,"Fits most of my brushes. It won't fit any really long handle brushes. My 12 didn't fit, but my 10 did. If you have a lot of brushes this wouldn't due. However for someone who doesn't have a lot of brushes yet, this is a great way to store them. Worth the investment if you like to keep things organized."
1,Don't buy,"1. Wears out quickly - locking gears start slipping2. Gears are to large - to get a tight fit you must use the next gear up which eventual result in gear slipping (see #1).3. If your walls are not square, which is very likely, does not fit solidly so you must use the next gear up (see #2)."
2,Not for jumpers!,"I bought this for my new 2 month 9 pound beagle. Product is very easy to put together, I was so happy to put him in it. Within a minute or so he was out, I couldn't believe it. So I put him back in there and watched him jump right out. Returned product the next day for full refund."
3,employeez,"Straight forward and simple for the employees to understand, not bad even for non-english native speakers as supported by obvious acting."
3,A chronology of quotations,"While this is a very interesting and well researched book on Oprah, keep in mind that it is an unauthorized biography. This book is basically a chronology of Oprah's life, and Adler does a decent job of stringing her quotes into a coherent history. A nice bonus is the section of short quotes on a wide variety of subjects. If you love Oprah, you'll probably love this book!"
4,Love the watch,"I love the watch. Sleek, classy and very light weight. A big plus for me is that the band is adjustable, I don't have to take it to the jeweler to have links taken out or put in. I always had a problem with wrist bands fitting me correctly-but no more! I've actually never seen a stainless steel wristband quite this thin and flexible before. So I give the watch 5 stars. However I wish I had looked around a bit more, even on Amazon's web site, for a better price because I could have gotten it for at least $20 less. But I like the watch too much to return it and reorder."
3,Looks nice but...,"Loved the look of this watch and ordered it. When I received it I was very happy with it. However, I found the clasp flimsy and consequently it fell off my wrist and the crystal cracked. A local jeweler couldn't replace it and directed me to the website. After reviewing the shipping, handling and repair fees - I put the watch in a drawer and chalked it up to a bad purchase. The watch is lovely, classy, elegant - and you would think the clasp would be substantial - but it isn't."
3,"We loved the book Sweet Tooth, it was hilarious!","In the book Sweet Tooth by Margie Palatini the characters areStewart, Sweet Tooth, tooth fairy and Stewart's sister. Thesetting of the story is mostly in Stewart's mouth. The problemin the story is that Sweet Tooth won't leave Stewart alone andgets him in trouble by demanding sweets. We recommend thisbook for all ages. We gave this book 3 stars for its funniness,silliness, craziness, randomness, and creepiness."
2,Not as Described,"I chose this saw because it was listed as being 8.2 pounds in the description. When I received it, the box had the weight of the saw listed as being 10.3 pounds. That dosesn't seem like much of a discrepancy but I was expencting 8.2 pounds. I am a grandma of almost 70 years and the extra weight makes a difference. The saw cannot be returned and therefore I am out over $200."
5,Better than anything Home Depot or Lowes had,"We tried several window, & moveable A/C units at Home Depot & Lowes, none of them could cool down our top floor rooms, and some were more expensive. This unit can make our top-floor rooms chilly during the hottest of days. We paid a handyman to wire a 240v line and couldn't be happier."
3,Make sure you are aware that you may need new wiring to plug in this machine,"This is a nice machine, but I was surprised when I received it to see that it requires special wiring to plug in! I was disappointed that I needed to hire an electrician to modify my wall outlet (and of course he didn't bother to show up when I had stayed home from work right before a heat-wave weekend!)"
2,They don't Work,"The book is interesting & I was really excited about the models & getting a chance to make things work. But, they did not Work! The biggest disapointment was the motor, I connected all the wires & made all the contacts properly & nothing happened. The wheels woobled on the dowels & when I attached the baloon to power the car with air, it turned over instead of moving forward. I tried very hard to make things work, but they did not."
5,Loved it!,I bought this book for my son when he was 8 and now I have bought it for my grandson when he is 8. Wonderful book for an inquiring young engineer!
2,Changed style - Not better,If you liked the other Harry Potter games this one will disappoint you. It is not a free-roaming game. You do not get to go to Hogwarts and enter classrooms and grounds and search for anything. You have very little control over what spells you cast and they have introduced a confusing and time consuming card system that does not improve the game. You don't get to fly around on your broom or look for secrets or items. The camera is useless. I don't know why they changed the game so much when the others were so much fun.Very disappointed.
4,woo nd bah,evrything was awsome!!!!!!! only thing was i liked having classes :( nd they didnt have that many at all.very different than the other 3. seller highly reccomend though.
1,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"This game is NOT fun at all! I thought is was going to be like the 3rd and 5th Harry Potter game, where you get to explore the castle and go around doing fun thinhgs but it was the complete opposite! You cannot explore the castle, play quidditch, or interact with anything. All you do is go through these different levels with set paths, and collect shields to unlock more levels. The camera angles also bothered me in that you could not rotate them. There are also little creatures that come out and attack you and you are supposed to use spells on, but they are just so annoying. Also, any duel you might have is set, so if you are supposed to win, you do no matter what. The only good things about this game is that you can pick your character (Harry, Ron, or Hermoine), and you can ride your broomstick (but only when you are being chased by the dragon in the first challenge) and there is already a path that you HAVE to follow. I would NOT recommend this game."
2,Not as good as the last ones . . .,"This game does not have any exploring of Hogwarts, and the levels are very limited, there are only ten or so short ones. You can't go around opening secret passageways and unlocking treasure chests like the predecessors, and the spell-casting system is unsatisfying, even if the graphics are much improved.With the spell-casting system, you can only cast a spell when you are in the right circumstances, unlike the freedom that you had before where spells were assigned to different buttons.Pros:Better GraphicsCooler-Looking SpellsCons:Not being able to explore HogwartsThe limited amount of playing timethe new spell-casting systemReally, if your a Harry Potter fan, get the Prisoner of Azkaban. Or Battlefront II. That's not a Harry Potter game but it's the best game you'll get this year."
2,Harry Potter Let Down,"This is by far the worst Harry Potter game put out so far. The camera angles are a pain since you can't change them, the controls while flying are a pain if you are used to reversing them and are not given that option, and this game has taken all the magic out of the experience. As a true Harry Potter fan, the best thing about the games was being able to explore Hogwarts. This game feels like a hit hit hit the button game which is unsatisfying and boring. Hope that EA games goes back to the previous format if they put a game out for the 5th movie!"
3,Too much like Lord of the Rings,"I agree with the other reviewers...why no roaming? I liked being able to start and end the day instead of just go thru different levels. Roaming around was one of the best parts of the game, sneaking past the prefects and flying aimlessly around on your broom. Overall a disappointment. The game is fun, but not like the others at all. Why the sudden switch?"
3,It's ok,"This is not my favorite of the Harry Potter games. It's so action oriented that it actually is very hard. It's great for people who like all action games, but I really feel it loses much of the story by being all action. And I miss tending classes. Part of the fun of the previous games was being able to go to school at Hogwarts and learning the magic. At least it was for me. I finished it, but I won't play it again."
2,A Disappointment,"Don't get me wrong. My wife loves this game. This is the first game on the PS2 I can get her to play.But the graphics are just plain terrible. It's difficult to see your character and distinguish him/her from the background. They frequently get lost on the screen clutter. Due mostly to the clunkiness of the character, the controls are difficult. But the good (or bad) news is that because the game is so easy, you can pretty much play the whole thing through in one sitting.Unless you're a die-hard fan and must have it, I wouldn't recommend this game."
2,This game is Horrible,Belive me as a kid that played Chamber of Secrets and never finished it and as a reviewer this game is horrible there is no wandering around the grounds and the only time u do touch the ground is in Forbidden forest. The only time you touch a broom is on the first Test. YA the graphics on the characters are better but the controls are confusing and the camera just SUCKS sure the spells are neat but it really just is horrible.Bottom line Im not telling u not to buy itRent it if you like it Buy it. But dont Go out and buy it right away.
1,Save your money,"EA completely revised and changed a good thing. I am so frustrated with this game, if you dont get so many triwizard shields you cant unlock any more areas of the game. With HP 2&3 i couldn't stop playing, with this one, i dont even want to. Its such a disappointment that EA ruined a good ting. There is no exploring Hogwarts and finding secret passages, finding treasure, its just not what i expected at all."
1,Beware of this Seller!,"I purchased this ""combo"" disc set as a Christmas gift in October. Of course, the gift was opened yesterday at Christmas and it's now over the 30 day time frame and the ""set"" was missing one of the Discs. So now, my gift is worthless since that person doesnt own a blue ray player and the disk missing is the DVD. I order from Amazon often and will not recommend ever using this seller as their product is defective and there is no way to rectify it now that the ""gift"" was ordered over 30 days ago."
5,BRILLANT- CLOSE TO PERFECTION,"Finally, a thriller that actually thrills. This is the best psychological thriller in the past decade. I could write a 10 page review to praise this film. However, I won't because I do have a life. If you want to see a great psychological and suspenseful thriller this film is a must see. The script, the acting and the direction are spectacular. This is one of those intellectual psych thrillers. Thus, if you are not intellectual you will not appreciate its nuances. Ryan Reynolds gives an Oscar worthy performance [I know!!!]. Two very enthusiastic thumps up!!!"
1,SUCKED!!!!!!,It kept you pulled in and wasted your time in hopes the guy would get saved... being a veteran of the OIF conflict i felt for the guy and his last breaths were met with disapointmentit was a waste of 90 minutes i will never get back i would rather go back to iraq for 90 minutes than watch this movie. wow complete let down was a cheap low budget film total cost 300 bucks what a waste
1,waste of time,waste of my time! I started to skip through to see if there was going to be anything different. If you watch the first few minutes you have seen the movie. I would suggest moving on to something else like the very end.
1,Wow...just when you think you've seen it all...it gets worse!!,"Uhm, the only thing worse than being trapped in a box buried underground...would be being trapped in a box buried underground watching this movie. It was so...and I do mean so lame. I don't want to ruin the plot for you but I will tell you that the title, (wait for it) is the Plot...that's it...besides a lot of yelling....nothing more...nothing less...just buried....I wish I could bury the memory of having wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie.Buyer Beware"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"I have seen bad movies before, but I can almost always find a redeeming feature that justifies my time spent watching it. This movie has none. It is the worst movie ever. The ENTIRE movie is from within a box. NO SHOT exists outside the box. Please don't waste your time by watching this. I just lost 1.5 hours of my life."
1,"If you loved ""Loose Change"" you deserve this movie.","Enjoyed the acting, directing, cinematography, make-up, nearly everything was fun to watch. Since I can't give the story -5 stars, I'll rate this a 1. The plot detracted from all other aspects of the movie. I felt it was an insult to my intelligence and awareness of reality."
2,So stupid,The only reason this didn't get one star is that it has some appealing qualities considering it's a movie that takes place inside a box. But it's still stupid. Too man little annoyances. I'd rather be buried alive than watch this again.
1,Didn't passed 20 minutes,"Really? What a waste of talent. I've watched bad movies and this one beats all of them. It's not that this guy is buried on the box, it's just that nothing happenscand if you have the time to waste, then try going beyond those 20 minutes. Browsing through the reviews, I know that I didn't missed a thing!"
1,"Worst Movie, Ever","Ryan Reynolds is a great actor, but this film is just awful.I won't bore you with any details or spoilers, it's just bad."
2,2 stars for the actor....the rest is ....,i got this movie for free...and still fast fowarded cause you have to be prettybored to give 2 hours of your life looking at a movie about a guy buried underground. This would have been better in a book format...at least you can doyour reading outside and not be stuck in front of a black box waiting for thingsto happen and get dissapointed cause you probably had to pay to look at a blackbox...
1,Bury this DVD. Bury it deep so it is never found......,"This movie speaks for itself. It is not to be watched by claustrophobic people...Actually, it is not to be watched by any person who doesn't want to lose a hour and a half of their lives. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Or if you can't pass the Amazon Deal of the day up at such a amazing price..Buy it...But then do what the film says....Bury it....Deep so that it is never found. Complete and utter torturous to watch. And Im a Ryan Reynolds fan. I would rather take a hot staple in the eye....then have to be subjected to watching this hot mess ever again in my life. Because this system wont let me leave no stars I am unable to. But please do not mistake the forced 1 star for an actual 1 star for this film...No Stars for you Buried...None. Just Dirt....Lots of Dirt and a shovel."
1,A film to be buried,The reviews were so good I thought I would go against my better judgement. Yet so boring. A film with one actor and no action. Even fast forwarding it still made it boring. Worse than watching cricket.
1,Worst movie that I have seen for the last year,"If I can give this movie -100 stars, I will. I have seen some pretty bad movies, but this one actually makes me angry. Who would spend the money and energy to write and produce some garbage like this! This entire movie is a disguise to shove some political ideal down your throat. I feel like that I had just spent the last an hour and a half listening to a time-share condo's sale pitch. When I got the movie, I was all psyched. A guy is buried with nothing other than a cell phone and lighter, now has to figure out where he is and get himself out, how smart is that! There is nothing smart about this movie, or good for that matter. It may not come as a surprise to a lot of people that Ryan Reynolds is not a good actor. He was over acting in every scene, which made the entire exercise in stupidity even worse. Oh, man, I need something that makes me forget this movie asap."
1,Better than Frozen,"I just watched the movie 'Frozen' last night and wrote a review saying it did not deserve even the one star I was forced to give it. Buried I'd say is worth the one star, but only because of Ryan Renolds acting, although renting it on Blu-Ray thinking it might be of better quality I have to say it isn't worth the extra cost. The movie has no point whatever unless it was trying to convince Americans not to go to countries like Irag or Afganistan in civilian jobs to make presumably a lot of money. In the end the company Renold's character works for sells him out so as not to have to pay the insurance when he turns up dead. Add to the lack of substance, a margin of gore to the Nth degree and you have yourself a one star movie."
4,I liked it and I liked it a lot,I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this movie. I really enjoyed watching this movie. There was a lot suspense and it took a lot of talent to make a movie that is entirely filmed inside of a box the size of a coffin. The scene with the snake was terrifying. I am glad that despite the bad reviews no one dared to tell how this story ended.
2,Eye catching yet boring,Honestly the movie was eye catching Yet very boring I didn't want to watch it yet I did because I wanted to know what happened. It is definitely not something i'd tell someone to buy. Rent it from the redbox if you have an urge to see it. The title says it all. The entire movie he's burried! Had a good story to it just wasn't as interesting and thrilling as I enjoy.
1,Worst movie ever,"This is the worst movie ever and there was absolutely no point to it. In addition to the poor story line, there were too many periods of awkward silence."
3,Interesting take,"Interesting premise and ambitiously shot. The whole film takes place in a coffin.Barring the holes and gaps in the film, it's a bold undertaking."
1,Buried,Don't like movies that are confined to one place. Kept losing interest and couldn't keep watching to the end.Gave up.
2,Very dark...and too drawn out,"This film is way too long for the story it tries to present. Also, it was extremely dark in nature and the audio was UP/down making it quite hard to enjoy."
4,A Great View,I just don't get the whole Ryan Reynolds `thing.' What is his appeal?This movie had such potential and it is okay. Jennifer Jason Leigh `rocked' this performance better over a decade ago in a TV movie.I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I might buy it. It is a great group film with your friends.
2,"Great acting, good plot, terrible ending","In fact the ending actually ruined the whole movie, have no use for this movie now and dont plan on ever watching it again, it would simply be a waste of time. Listen, the plot is great, man stuck in a coffin with a cell phone and very little light & running out of time(air). All great stuff, Reynolds is fantastic and believable, when the ending comes up you could expect 3-4 different outcomes, except the one that they chose to end this movie. For me it made the whole movie a waste of time watching it."
1,Go to the next movie.....spoiler alert below,SPOILER ALERT!!!This movie is leaving me with nightmares. I was left hoping throughout the entire film that something positive would occur. There are three if at most four suspenseful moments in the film all of which make you cringe in hope this guy comes out alive. Well he doesnt....so whats the purpose in seeing a film like this?! If you want to enjoy the movie for its cinematography then thats about all you're going to get out of it. It takes place COMPLETELY INSIDE A BOX. Therefore there is no bigger picture or excitement or anything other than sadness and hopelessness in the end. I would NOT recommend this to a friend. I rather have watched another movie. I wish I could have my 1hr and 30 minutes back.
1,Just bad,Very boring and unrealistic. I only watched the whole movie because it costed me $3.99. Definitely won't recommend it to anyone.
2,WTF,"This movie is decent right up to the ending. The ending is disappointing, and worth rating this movie so low."
5,No--this movie was Amazing.,"I was not expecting much--except to be bored. It was so compelling that I'm still reeling. It takes a lot of guts for a director to do this kind of movie, and a skilled one to pull it off. He pulled this one off, and it was one of the most rewarding that I've seen in a long time."
3,Gimmicky,"So, yeah, Ryan Reynolds can act. Great job! But the movie itself is so full of gimmicks and full of set ups just for the sake of making something happen. This story could have been told in a matter of 15 to 30 minutes, but instead was forced into an hour and a half. The plot felt forced, the bad guys were simply stereotypical, middle eastern bad guys and, oh my god, how many times will no one answer the goddamned phone? I'm still trying to figure out if the writer of this film is angry about getting the run around on the phone or if he is angry about the war in Iraq. The premise is interesting but, really, did it have to be an hour and a half? Did the guy really have to cut of his finger and how many set ups for lighting do we really need? I am impressed, however, by Ryan Reynold's performance. If it weren't for him I most likely would not have watched this movie. Great job casting director! But all in all, the movie felt too gimmicky and the ending wasn't at all surprising."
2,Meh... I felt it was a waste of time.,Sorry not for me. I watched the entire thing overall I feel it was a waste of time. Very one-layered. Good acting but then again it was all in a box.
3,Very good but a little slow to watch,"I must say I enjoyed watching buried however it is a bit hard watching someone buried alive for a hour and a half though i get why they shot it that way. Over all the film was pretty good even if it tends to be slow at parts, its nice to watch something a little different. If your fan of Ryan Reynolds then this is a must see for you and I recommend it for a movie night or if its raining outside and you just want to stay in doors, either way im glad to add it to my collection of films. I give it a 7 and a half just because its a little slow but a must see none the less"
2,"This movie isn't horribe, not that great either..",.I've seen this done much more masterfully by a few other film makers...The whole kidnapped & trapped in one spot thing has been done...Ryan is awesome but the pacing just isn't good enough & the ending sucks
3,Do we really need this in HD? LOL,"I really liked the movie and keep thinking through out the movie, ""this surly can't be the whole movie!"" Then when I saw that amazon had it in HD I LOLed! Overall I liked the plot, not sure if I could watch it again though!"
3,Not that bad,"Kind of unbelievable and farfetched but still maybe worth seeing if you like claustrophobic stuff, goes on too long but has some tense moment."
1,"Horrible movie, 1hr and 36 mins of a guy in a box","The whole 1hr and 36 mins of this movie was of this guy in a box. No scenes outside of the box, I watched 10 mins and was bored to death. Fast forwarded thru the rest and the whole movie is of him in the box. If you are trying to fall asleep this is the movie for you. If you want a good movie don't bother"
1,worst movie ever,"people should get pay to see this movie, i mean cheesy all the way, the dialogue is the worst, i mean its real terrible, you can't get back your time"
1,One of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen,"This movie was the biggest waste of time I have spent in a long time. I think it actually could have been a good idea, but any good feelings I had about the movie were spoiled by the sick feeling I had in my stomach after it was over. I guess if you like being depressed and disgusted you may like it, but if you want to actually enjoy a movie, do not waste your time with this one."
1,I want my 1.5hrs back,"I usually really enjoy Ryan Reynolds movies - however this one left me with a lot to be desired. It had a Blair Witch feel with only showing the main character in a casket for the entire flick. I was hoping for some resolution by the end, but story line was just not good."
1,AWFUL!!,"I seldom write a review about anything. However, I just had to for this movie.I rented this DVD through Redbox for $1, plus tax, and I feel CHEATED!! Don't bother wasting time to waste your money buying this.I guess you don't have to have any scruples to be the sexiest man in the world. (People magazine)"
1,aweful,Luckily i only rented this for $1. It could have been so much more better if they showed how he got in the coffin and cut to other scenes of the people trying to find him. Instead it was 90 min of him laying in a coffin making cell phone calls the entire time.
1,Worthless,DONT WASTE UR TIME!!! THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS SHOT WITH 3 DIFF CAM ANGLES IN A COFFIN... TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE...
1,He Dies!! Now go be productive.,"There, now you don't have to waste your 90 minutes to see if anything actually happens worth while. He's trapped, he calls people and they can't help, there is a snake, and they don't find him in time. He dies, so thankfully the movie can end."
4,"The new curved last on the bottom of the shoe, problematic","The Reebok DMX Max have been my favorite athletic shoes. Recently, Reebok has changed the last on the bottom of the shoe and called it a feminine last. That's nice if your feet are perfect and have never been injured. The DMX Max is still wonderfully comfortable. However, I have ended up at the Podiatrist's office with irritation on the outside of my right foot, which has recovered from several stress fractures. I hope Reebok continues to make DMX walking shoes with a straight last for the variables that people often face in life. The curved last may be a little more stylish , but the doctor has told me not to wear them. I really miss the old ladies' ""walk DMX Max"" which appears to be unavailable. It was like ""Old Faithful""."
1,Never buy Reebok again,"I have purchased 2 pairs of the Women's Versa Comfort DMX Max shoes in the past. Loved them-really comfortable shoes. I previously used them for walking. About a year ago, I began a combination of walking/running. I asked Reebok online which shoe is recommended for such exercise. Twice no response. Over the weekend, I shopped in nearby stores and found most Reeboks are now cheaply made with much higher prices. Worse yet, they are completely uncomfortable. Did I also say they are hideously ugly? Decided to buy online today, but find the Versa Comfort DMX Max shoes have been altogether discontinued.I choose the companies and products I buy carefully and I try to buy from companies who are sensitive to customers and make good products. In my opinion, Reebok is no longer among those companies. Won't be buying Reeboks anymore!"
1,"Troma didn't make it, but it still ...","The previous reviewers of this film intimated that this was ""bad even for Troma,"" without realizing that the movie was made years before Costner's stardom by a group of indie filmmakers. Troma bought the movie, then called ""Malibu Hot Summer,"" and re-released it as ""Sizzle Beach U.S.A."" just as Costner was becoming a household name. Even with a new name, it's still a stinker. The film about 3 women ""discovering themselves,"" and for one of the women (the director's wife!) that involves getting it on with Costner, who plays a young, wealthy ranch owner. Check out his midget sidekick! Silly and full of awful, early-era breast implants."
1,Only one reason to subject yourself to this junk: Costner at 18,"Sizzle Beach is not a ""movie"" at all; it's a piece of film that outlastedit's original venue -- Arcade porn videos -- because it contains theearliest views of Costner as a teenager in a movie. Worse than home movies, there are no actors in this film, only anatomy, and the ""quality"" of color, etc. is deplorable. That said, for fans of Kevin-the-C you will be amazed atthe quality he projects on screen. It's all there, the handsome sexypersona of the all-American wise guy. He leaps off the screen at you.Dated 1974, it's hard to believe what he could do with his eyes eventhen, and with no help from any skilled director or technician.For Costner connoisseurs only."
5,This is the worst movie ever...,"...that's why I gave it five stars. Induce mild-altering substances and then subject your friends to this movie. You'll laugh, and you just might cry because it is so horrible.To the first reviewer... isn't Dit the cousin of Steve, not Janice ? This movie IS decidedly horrible, but I don't think they added incest just for kicks. But then again I have only ever seen it in French so maybe I missed something. Anyway, WATCH THIS MOVIE for a bad time."
1,The single worst film from troma,"O.k. I know tromas famous for produceing bad films but this went to far.Three girls going to california to make their dreams come true and thats the plot almost sounds the same to the new britny spears movie but that ones probly worse.Yes Keven Costeners in it but not as much as the cover suggests.The film has lots of naked women in it with implants the producer says in the commentary.Extras are great as with any troma dvd.There is a commentary,2 interviews,troma related materal and t.i.t and tour of troma.The movie's horrid and hard to watch with all the hippie music and boring story I don't suggest anyone buying this dvd it's not worth it even with the nice extras."
1,Harry Potter 4,"Poor Graphics, No seperate Battles like in The first 3, This game plain out sucks what happened to the original game designer? Moody looks like a man with a Cover over his eye there is no point to this game."
1,Call this Harry Potter?,"I haven't played this game, but I've saw someone play it. From what it looks like, IT STINKS. My friend got it, and you can only do 1/3 of the stuff you can in Prisoner of Azkaban!! I'm not saying its the worst thing ever yet (because I haven't played it myself), but if you STILL want to play it, at least get it for Xbox or PS2."
1,"Bad product, worse service","First off, the program 'DPX' is extremly tempermental - it works most of the time when you turn on computer, and rarely works if if you restart.I've had E-mu for 3+ years and i put up with it because they had live; on the phone customer service. Now it's through a series of frustrating emails. I had sound problem one day. One day you send email, have to wait 24hs, for responce + they ask a question, if you don't understand their Q? you have to email again for them to repeat their Q?. by the way, weekends don't count. This went on for 4+ weeks, until i gave up. So i went with another system which i'm very happy with. I won't name them so you don't think this review is from the compitition company. If you don't believe me, be my guest try them."
2,Sent different product,"Item shipped was a Pleatco PA90, not a Unicel C-8409. Bait and Switch!Hayward Star-Clear Plus C-900, Sta-Rite PXC-95 open w/molded gasket - Pleatco PA90, Unicel C-8409, Filbur FC-1292"
2,MISLEADING,I did not read the last review and should have. I searched for Unicel and finally found it here so i thought. DID NOT GET A UNICEL.WIll never buy from them agaiin
5,Pool Filter,"Product arrived on time, installed it (fit correctly) and is working fine. Have cleaned it several times with no problems."
2,Love the design but the material is very rough like burlap,It's hard to tell by looking at the picture but the material is rough like burlap. Not blanket material at all. I don't think it should be called a blanket because it is not soft enough. I would call it a wall hanging.
4,"Awesome pants, fit over cloth diapers, does run small","These were my favorite baby pants. Very soft, unique, and the fit over cloth diapers was perfect. I had the 3-6 month size and they were more newborn size - they fit as soon as we got them (my son was about 9-10 lbs at the time) and he outgrew them before he was 3 months old. If you have 8/9 lb babies like me go ahead and order up a size."
2,Not up to snuff,"Review of Ian Rankin's Resurrection MenIt had been a while since I read an Ian Rankin thriller. Either I had rated him too high before, or else this one is not up to snuff.The dialogue is bland, and lacks both depth and sharpness. The plot wanders, and the length of the book seems less owing to the need of a well-shaped plot than to the fact that the story had reached a certain number of pages."
2,Rebus holding out,"Reading an entire book where Inspector Rebus sits on his hands and watches his mouth was just horridly dull. I thought the idea behind this book was great but the execution was poor. Save for Siobahn's subplot, this book was nearly unreadable. It's a good thing I know there are far better novels in this series."
2,What men talk about,"I'd always wondered what men talk about when they are in groups by themselves. This book tells me in page after page of meaningless conversations. The beginning and the end were interesting and caught my attention. But the middle-oh my! Is police investigation so haphazard in reality?This was the first Rebus novel I've read. I'll try another, just to see if they are all so dull. I had high hopes when I started the book that it would be about how an experienced officer handled his frustrations in a difficult job and his relationships with others on the job. Not so, unfortunately."
2,a bit disappointing,"This is the third of the DI Rebus books I've read, and the others were much more enjoyable. The plot was clever, but the book was way too long and convoluted, and the entire thing was very depressing for me, especially the ending. A disappointment."
3,None,A plodding and dense read. The ending not a great reward for having to wade through a shopping list of dull characters.Too many crooks spoil the plot.
5,"A gritty, gripping adventure","This book was a hard boiled gem. It has grit and facinating characters that carry a wonderfully crafted storyline to the finish. If you haven't read this author, start now, you won't regret it."
4,Edgar Winning Police Procedural,"Police corruption is a subject all South Floridiansare familiar. In the early 1980s a vast police drug rip-off collapsed when three dead drug guards were fished from the Miami River. Cops had forced them to jump into the river while they swiped the coke, never bothering to ascertain who could swim.Scotland's Detective Inspector John Rebus is sent undercover to infiltrate a gang of rogue cops. All are assigned to a retraining program for police, where their assignment may uncover Rebus's own culpability in a crime. Slowly, fearfully Rebus connects the dots between the areas latest murder, an imposing crime boss, and an unsolved cold case.This book won an Edgar in spite of its dense regionalism. It is however a carefully plotted tale of mystery and pursuit by a policeman whose own haunting guilt fails to dissuade him from his duty."
1,extremely boring,This book was so boring that I gave up. I really cannot understand how it could win the Edgar Award (usually books which won this award are good).
3,Boring !!,"I didnt like the novel at all. I can not believe that this novel received Edgar award. Story is boring and slow paced. *SPOILERS - BEGIN* There are bunch of sub-plots and at the end all of them, rather hastly, put together to provide a so called twist which didnt impress me at all. *SPOILERS - END*Only character i liked was DS Sibhan Clarke who is a novice female detective trying to make her name in a male dominating profession. I dont think i will try Ian Rankin novel again."
4,Training Day,"I am on an Ian Rankin kick. And this one is pretty good. Rebus is off to training in this one and comes across cold cases that he is able to help solve. Clarke is kind of on her own while he's away, but they eventually come together with their excellent one-two punch. Enjoyed it. Not my favorite by this author, but I enjoyed it."
4,Another Interesting Mystery From One of the Masters,"Ian Rankin is one of my favourite mystery writers and this book does not disappoint - as usual. Read it and you will get into the world or Inspector Rebus and his Scots sensibilities and bang on sense of place and occasion.Timothy Wingate, Ottawa CANADA"
1,what a rip-off...,"okay basically, did you watch the show? that's whats on the DVD.the only thing they dont censor is the limited amount of cursingthat wasnt edited out already. everything is blurred out. thesound, picture quality (WHICH BTW IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN FULLSCREEN)and anything else you would think a DVD might have as far as anupgrade from watching it on cable/satellite is not on it.oh im sorry, they have a lame special features disc and a handfulof deleted scenes. if youve seen this show already, dont buy it,do not let them get any money from this. its too late for me however.just dont make my mistake.if i could give it a 0/0 i would.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD"
1,Show - Great; DVD - Terrible,"Ok, this is not a critique of the show, which I absolutely loved. However, the DVD was of very poor quality. First, it is not ""uncensored"" like the ad suggests. The DVD presentation is identical to the TV show. Second, there are basically no special features other than some deleted scenes thrown in. Finally, the picture quality was very mediocre and below DVD (480p) standards. It seemed like a DVD put together by someone working from a home computer. All of the touches that accompany a quality DVD release are absent. Honestly, if you have already DVRed the episodes, then this is not worth buying."
2,Dissapointed,"This show is great, but buyer beware this DVD is NOT uncensored. Not only do they still blur out any nudity, they also still beep out certain words. If you're looking for a truly uncensored experience, this isn't it. If you just love the show and want it on DVD it's great."
1,Jersey Shore,"Jersey shore is nothing but nonsense! I can't believe that Americans actually watch this show, much less let their kids watch this. Perhaps this is what's wrong with us as a nation. Wake up people."
3,UNCENSORED????? dont think so!!!,"great tv show, it was great but this dvdis NOT uncensored ppl!!! so if u wanna seesnokes doing her back flips..... sry guys theyblock it out!! its the same thing as it was on tvjust the cuseing isnt bleep out"
4,"Entertaining, but not uncensored!","This season was very entertaining to say the least. There is much more action in this season than the following ones. My only negative comment is it states it is uncensored, but it is not! It blurs out nudity and only allows SOME curse words to be said which is disappointing."
1,Now what you expected,"The series IS censored except for some of the language.Even some of the original inserted text is c*nsor*d.Everything that was blured out on the TV versions is also blured out on the DVD.Scenes and shots seem to be missing from the original show.The TV show was more high def than the DVD is.You would expect that the DVD would follow the story, without the annoying fillers and previews that they added to the TV series to pad it out, but it doesn't.I put in the first disk and of course had to sit through or fast forward through all the other non related paid previews.I bought season 1 and 2. After watching the first 4 episodes I didn't need to watch any further because I have already seen the show on TV (which was better) so I boxed it up and put it on the shelf. I may give it away to someone who has not seen the show so that it wont be a complete waste of money."
1,Rip Off,I order this to view season one because I have never seen it before and it only has some episodes and they're not even in order.
2,waste of money; NOT uncensored as advertised,"This DVD was just like watching the TV show; if you already saw it, don't waste your money. It was not uncensored unless you count the cursing. If I knew that this version is EDITED as well, I never would have purchased it. Also, sound quality is not the greatest & it does not have closed caption. Video quality wasn't that great either."
4,Jersey Shore,"Were very pleased at how fast the order got to me, and couldn't ask for better service. it was great."
5,Who Wouldn't Love This,"Great Show! (except for Mike, Sammi, and Angelina) I watched the second season before this one, it was a great catch up! Jenni and Pauly should totally get together!!!"
5,Just Plain Entertaining!,"Guidos & Guidettes unite! Let the kids have their fun. What's with all of the controversy about how this show portrays Italians as a negative stereotype? If you think about it, everything on MTV does that. Everyone is portrayed as a stereotype for entertainment purposes. In this day and age of reality TV this is one of the most entertaining shows. It's a train wreck. For a few minutes it makes us forget about our own train wreck we call life. I can't wait for season two."
1,Poor,"What is TV doing to my state. As if Real Housewives was not bad enough, we have THIS.These guys in gold chains and more hair moose than I have reviews move into a Jersey Shore, pick up girls, fight with the girls they already brought with them........well, I don't want to elaborate. Like a car crash, a napalm attack, or a medical student discecting a big cold stiff, you just have to watch to get the idea.Most of Jersey is subburbs and woods. We are right outside of New York City, and have one of the most educated and diverse populations out there. I don't know where these guys came from, and please, don't tell me. But this is not the Jersey I know.However, like that bloody car wreck or the process of making lamb into veal, if you are really interested, go ahead and look.I'll be reviewing Coltrane. And if New Jersey ever gets like this, I'll be reviewing Coltrane. In f--ki-n-g Prauge."
1,Ruining the real Jersey Shore.,"Imagine aliens landed at the jersey shore. You would think ""hey, look aliens"". Well thats what these people are, aliens that landed at the shore. First, I think 90% of these folks aren't Italian, second they all live in New York or Connecticut. Lets put it this way, the real Jersey Shore isn't paralyzed with these kind of folks. Its a shame."
1,Pathetic,This show panders to the base level displaying mind numbing partying pathetic individuals. It is truly sad that this show even exists.It is even worse that it has been given a showcase on Amazon.
1,CRAP,"This is the worst show ever ""written."" I honestly think someone had a chimp start pushing buttons on the keyboard and created Jersey Shore. ""Hey, lets watch a bunch of orange-tanned idiots create drama about their peony little lives."""
1,My IQ just dropped after seeing this,"I tried to watch this because I was soooo bored. I couldn't stand it for more than 10 minutes. They're so stupid to a point its not even funny. Somehow these people out-stupid Jackass, and I've had my share of laughs watching Jackass from time to time.How do I describe these people? Shallow, too stupid to live, but to my amazement... arrogant. It is seriously like watching a bunch of 10 year olds socializing but with alcohol and sex. I can't believe these people are role models to children... and I'm 22 years old, not some old prude.Ladies and gents... our culture has hit a new low."
1,Jersey Shore: Uncensored,"I was soooo very dissapointed with this DVD...it wasn't even the whole season. You didn't even put in one of the funniest parts of the season and it was when Pauly D. was being stalked by stalker girl, or when he argued with her on the phone. I wish I could get my money back. I will NEVER buy a Jersey Shore season dvd every again."
1,Great Show but the DVD is Horrible,The DVD is not uncensored as it is advertised and there isn't anything extra on it. Just wait for the reruns
4,Not really uncensored...,"Some of the cuss words are bleeped out. Typical MTV product. You market to the mature crowd just to provide a product still meant for the kids.It's the Jersey Shore, fist pumping, drama at the end... so still get 4 stars."
2,IF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS SEASON ALREADY....DON'T BUY!,THE DVD IS THE SAME AS THE DAMN SHOW ON MTV! VERY LITTLE IS UNCENSORED...AND IT'S ONLY BAD WORDS! YOU DO SEE SNOOKIE GET PUNCHED THOUGH...MUCH WORSE THAN I THOUGHT! AMAZON IS GIVING ME A COMPLETE REFUND ON THIS! THE QUALITY IS POOR ALSO!
3,I thought it was uncensored,"so i got this in hope that it would be uncensored, but no there are still *&@^# when the captions come on there are still blur spots to hide all the good stuff. so i wasnt to happy with that whats the point of callign it uncensored when its still censored. If you missed a few show its worth getting but if you lookign for nudity you will get none here"
1,Jersey Shore,Every time you watch Jersey Shore a book commits suicide. Please stop encouraging these pathetic creatures by watching this mess.
2,Time you will never get back,An amusing show if only to feel sorry for these kids that now forever have their irresponsible late teen/early twenties naive selves forever preserved to video.
2,NOT Uncensored,These DVDs let you hear everyone swear but they are still censored.One example: Snooki goes into the hot tub wearing a thong and her whole backside is blurred out. (Probably a good thing)Don't expect to see anything you haven't already seen on TV. Be prepared to hear the F-bomb repeatedly dropped. Yawn.
1,no stars. People like this?,If anyone likes this garbage it shows what type of vile human you are. What else is there really to say? Oh. They casted the ugliest people to be on tv.
1,"Seriously, don't we have anything better to do?","It isn't just this show, I despise all reality tv. The simple reason is, that it isn't actually reality. The second the cameras start rolling it is edited. Either by the crew after filming or simply by the participants during filming. Lets face it, the ""actors"" are not going to show their complete true selves on television. Wake up world put down the remote. Go back to school, read a book etc."
1,uncensored my b$lls,Should have known better than to think anything from MTV is uncensored. Your watching the same bleeps and bubbles and black-outs that were on TV. False advertising at it's finest! Will start procedure to get money back. I love the series though!
2,The bad kind of depressing.,"I really loved HIROSHIMA and especially MY PETITION FOR MORE SPACE, so I picked up this one at a used book store. It is sort of like CATCHER IN THE RYE or A SEPARATE PEACE in that it is a story of young men away at school, and what that can be like. But this thing just went foul and relentlessly dour on me. The protagonist just spirals into this nastier and nastier situation and in the end is none the better for it (IMHO), hasn't learned anything, none of that stuff that is supposed to happen to protagonists. I felt horrible after finishing this, and it wasn't the ""good"" kind of horrible. Just depressed and sickened. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 only because the writing itself is good; just the story was really really weak."
3,"It left me going ""what?""","It was a very interesting book with, in my humble opinion, a many possible interpretations. If you like that sort of thing, this could be a good book for you. Now, one could say it was a metaphor for the turmoil of that period of time....or one could say some entirely different things about it."
5,Ventures-wild again!!,"These guys haven't put out a bad album yet, and this one rates up there with their original recordings. Calling in Duane Eddy to do ""I fought the Law"" was brilliant. I bought two copies of this, in case I break one. I don't do that often. If you are not a ventures fan, this CD will convert you!"
4,Growing whiskers,"This is a fine book, with short biographical chapters of American Muslims from many different ""tastes"" of Islam. It would be nice if Baraboza did a follow-up on the people still with us or another book with the under 40 crowd. I have used this book in many contexts with success.Concerning the reviewer who does not like the emphasis on Nation of Islam and its subsequent transformation, somewhere around 40% of American Muslims are African American. Many families went from one generation in the Nation to the next in ""orthodox"" sunni Islam. It is an important part of 20th c. American history. I am glad it has been reprinted.Now, who is going to sue Steve Emerson for stealing the title?"
3,It's good,"Crawl,punch,and swing your way to the top in the newest superherorumble Spiderman2: The Sinister Six for GBC. As Spidey, you are called upon to save a kidnapped auntie M (aunt May for those of you who aren't familiar) from the many-tentacled clucthes of Doc Ock. All of Spidey's powers are yours to use, including the ability to cling to walls, super strength, speed, and web-slinging and more. Spiderman 2 contains game play similar to its PS1 cousin, with suberb graphics and sound rounding out and impressive title."
4,Great Buy!,"We searched far and wide for the perfect vacuum to help take care of our home. I wasn't too excited with the bagless variety as they expose one to a lot of dust, bugs, and spores when being emptied. I wanted a bagged vacuum with strong suction and the Hoover WindTunnel caught my eye. The price is a bit steep but in reality not too bad for a quality vacuum.The dirt finder seems to always be on! But after a good long session it finally stayed in the clean position. I didn't think our home was that bad...The only drawback to the unit is that it is a little heavy and may cause some concern for those who have stairs. Since we don't have to worry about that, we are happy with the unit.The Cleaning Tools are a Plus and the hose extends to a great height.I would recommend this product to anyone!"
2,$$$ bags,Although the indicator light is a wonderful feature it does not help the fact that the bags break VERY quickly. They are expensive and the dust sent throughout the house is a mess.
1,not happy,"This vacuum sucks! It blows air about a million miles an hour and is sooo noisy! They sent me the wrong one first of all, I asked for the bagged model and the sent me the baggless. It is so dirty when you try to clean the vacuum out. Dirt is everywhere. Don't Buy!!!"
4,"Great vacuum, but poorly balanced.","First of all, in terms of cleaning power, this is a great vacuum. It picks up a bunch of stuff other vacuums leave behind. I do like how powerful it is, and I like how the handle becomes the 'wand' for picking up small things/crevices. We've had this vacuum for 2 years, and we use it fairly often. I had to fix a plastic latch that broke near the foot/release pedal -- a small little plastic piece that I wasn't aware had broken, and couldn't figure out why the vacuum kept tipping over. Now that it's been fixed, it's great. The vacuum is a bit heavy, but otherwise, a very good vacuum."
2,Plastic handle broke!,"Decent vacuum, however, why make the handle (a load bearing member) out of plastic?!? Snapped off in my hand, making the vacuum pretty much unusable.Pros: versatile (hose is attached and quick to use, all attachments fit on the vacuum), good suction, easy to use.Cons: as others have mentioned - cumbersome/bulky/heavy. You must keep an eye out and replace bag frequently, otherwise a full bag will break/overload the circuit board (I had that replaced under warranty, luckily). However, its biggest weakness is a PLASTIC handle. I've owned this vacuum about 3 years, and the handle broke in my hand when lifting. On inspection, I noticed the only metal is a screw which holds the handle together, the rest is all plastic - unacceptable for any piece of equipment one expects to own more than a few years. End result - off to Goodwill with this vacuum. Hoover has lost my business forever, I'd rather purchase a used Kirby off of eBay than continue with this piece of junk."
3,good bust wish it was self propelled,"I am a busy Mom of 3 with a dog, I needed a vacuum that was reliable and easy to use. I liked the attachments this one offered. That being said it is soo heavy I wish it was self propelled if my house was 2 stories I would return this thing right away. I am unsure of the automatic cord rewind my kids won't quit playing with it and I have a feeling it's going to break at some point and then I am going to have to figure out what to do with the 28ft cord. Also I am short and this is a tall vacuum much taller than my previous windtunnel. I also don't like the tube just hanging off the side of the vaccum there's a little clip that is SUPPOSED to hold it in but it doesn't work hardly at all and I wonder in a could years once the tube is stretched and not so new if it's going to become a pain. I am still debating returning the one honestly but it does have great suction and I like that."
2,Badly designed,"Product provided average quality service for two years, Then it broke where foot release is attached to vacuum (due to lack of reinforced part, which is needed there because of wear resulting from use of the release)and at about the same time the off/on switch intermittently stopped working."
5,I will only buy Hoover....,"I've owned two Hoover Windtunnel's previous to this one, and loved both of them. Before purchasing this vacuum, I decided to try something new. I bought the Bissell Velocity Bagless Vacuum. It's horrible compared to this Hoover. The Bissell's suction was not even close to being as good as the Hoover, and bagless is horrible! I had to empty the container 3 times every time I vacuumed. This Hoover vacuum is strong and smooth. I love it and am so glad and got rid of the Bissel and bought this one. I will only buy Hoover from now on, as I know no other vacuum can compare."
2,"The W2 sucks good, the bags suck bad","The FACTS:- The Hepa bag works fine, up until the point it falls apart.- The slide top comes unglued from the bag. This has happened in all 6 of my bag replacements, and only one I would consider full.- Once the bag falls apart, it spreads dust throughtout the vaccuum, and ultimately around the house.- Even though there is no bag replacement indicator, I know when its time to replace the bag when the house begins to smell like a used matress while vaccuuming.- The vaccuum suction is great on carpets, so so on floors.- Vaccuum is heavy, to heavy for my 8 year old to use.- Vaccuum body does not lean low enough, this also limits use by children as it lifts the brush off the ground.- Quiet enough to hold converstation while in vaccuum mode.- Uncomfortably loud when in upright mode.- If cord is not fully withdrawn it becomes mildly hot. Not good when cord is always retracting on its own volition.Aside from the good suction, I would not recommend this carpet."
1,Would not recommend,"I purchased this item in December 2006. Within two months it was dead. As it was under warranty, but too late to return to seller, I sent it to a Hoover repair center. They told me the computer had messed up and needed to be reset. In all, shipping and repair took two months. Now we are in Jan. 2008, just over one year from purchase. It has died again--I'm pretty sure it is from the same thing. I would not recommend that anyone buy this vacuum. Also, the bags are very expensive and hard to find. I have had to order all the bags online."
2,"Wow, is this thing HORRIBLE!","I purchased this vacuum based on the (mostly) good remarks here on Amazon and also due to the high rating by Consumer Reports.I'll start off with the positives. I thought it was very easy to push even with the carpet setting set to low pile. It is very quiet compared to my older Hoover vacuum. The cord is nice and long too.Now the negatives. Well, there is really only one negative. I have two short hair cats who shed a normal amount. When vacuuming, most of the hair FAILS TO GO INTO THE BAG and gets blown into the compartment which holds the bag. So when you go to change the bag, there is a mess of hair and dirt to greet you. Total junk. I called my local vacuum repair shop to see what can be done and he advised me to return it ASAP since he's been flooded with the Windtunnel 2 complaints. This ain't your mother's Hoover. It's shameful how a good company turned horrible."
2,"Poor tool suction, bad design, too bulky, looks cool","My previous vacuum was a Hoover windtunnel (bagged and self propelled) from 15 years ago. I loved that vacuum. It was old and the beater thing was ready to be replaced again. So I thought I would follow Consumer Reports again, and go with #2 Allergy rated Windtunnel 2. I bought here on Amazon. I used it 4 times. Not self-propelled, so it felt like a ton to push around. The extender wand tool on the hose has poor suction. And with only one bag and no filter, the exhaust smells dusty. NOOOOO comparison to my old beat up Hoover which was self propelled and tons of suction. And the extender wand seems nice, but its heavy and holding it above your head, and replacing it into hole is hard to do. Kills your shoulders. If you have a large first floor with lots of carpet, and a strong back and shoulders, I still would not recommend it. I wish I could find an identical replacement to my old Windtunnel."
3,Just OK,"I like the way the vacuum works and all the attachments, but something already broke off - the cord holder... It doesn't make or break the vacuum functioning so I have decided to just keep it."
2,Do Not Recommend,"Even though the Hoover U8311-900 Winteunnel Vacuum Cleaner had very good pickup, it was bulky and hard to push. After using it twice, the on/off switch shorted out and the unit could not be turned on. Returned for credit and will buy something else."
1,Two-Time Loser,"This thing looks and performs wonderfully out of the box. The filters capture that disgusting vacuum smell, and its fun to watch all that dust and pet hair swirl around in the translucent box.Then it quit working. I figured that was the retailer's problem, not mine, so I returned it.Second model did the same thing and broke after about two hours of use. I had to bang on it and manually spin the rotating filter to get gobs of dirt dislodged (a ""gob"" is approximatley one pint. I removed ""gobs"").So this model has failed twice. Not what I want from an appliance that costs close to $300 and should last 10 years.Also, the attachments don't stay put and the little plastic keeper for the hose is in just the right spot to snap off on your thigh. And the handle broke on my first one.Come to think of it, this damn thing is pretty junky."
2,"Bulky & ""cheap"" easily broken plastic parts","The first day I used this vacuum, I realized how big and bulky it was. It is not easy to move around/ hard to push and to maneuver. The vacuum is not easily carried up and down stairs. The plastic parts on it are easily broken; a piece that holds the cord back out of the way broke the first day I used it. Extremely disappointed!!"
1,Very Poor Quality Vacuum,"This vacuum worked for about 2-minutes before the brushes stop turning. I took this to a authorized Hoover vacuum dealer to look at. After finding the problem was some bent pole that supported the brushes to work, they contacted Hoover only to find out there is a recall out for this vacuum cleaner model and the part was not available yet for the repair. So after purchasing this vacuum on February 1st, 2007, the vacuum is still at the repair shop 1-month later. Part is still not available. Stay away from purchasing this vacuum. I only kept it since Amazon.com charges you a re-stocking fee on open merchandise.Lyle....St.Louis, MO"
3,Hoover windtunnel,"Everything works great . The one complaint we have is the weight of the machine. The weight is all in the handle, it is very tiring on the arm."
1,thin stuff,"If you loved Poor Mouth, you may well be seriously disappointed by this collection, which consists of several very short sketches, each ending in an outrageous pun. The pun would be funny in a pub to someone who had drink taken, but not here."
1,Extremely poor packaging !!!,I got home found a very big box ! opened it carefully ! surprisebidet was completely broken... more than 20 small pieces !!!
3,Out of Nowhere Smash,"I remember when I first saw the video for this song. I thought it was pure crap! But then I heard the song on the radio and fell in love with it. I was only 9 years old at the time, and I wanted to go to the store and buy this CD myself. This was the first CD I ever bought, and I still have it. Although the non-Macarena songs aren't very good and hearing Macarena over and over kind of gets old, this CD is still a lot of fun to listen to. It's impossible to listen to and not want to do the dance."
5,Perfect,"This board is the first board I have used, and my dad also says it is a very good bristle board. Metal tip darts go in perfectly and don't fall out, as well as plastic tips which you have to throw a little harder to get in. Great in competitions and tournaments."
4,bull's-eye,great board for the price! I am currently deployed and it keeps the moral up! I go to different bases so i will probably order another one soon!Mahalo
4,Well worth it,"I'm not a professional, but this dartboard is well worth the money spent. Provided great entertainment hanging out with friends."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I guess the best thing to say is that you get what you pay for.The board is....cheaper than I thought, edges are rough, average 1 bounce off every 30 shots. Especially when aimed for the bullseye.One of the plastic shaft broken after about 50 shots, it got hit in the back and there it goes....Same is expect to all of them....BUT, oh well, this is fairly cheap and i guess...whatever~worth the fun."
2,Not Good,The surface is rough and hard. The dart could hardly be sticked into the board. It is really dangerous when the dart rebounds from the wall.
1,No Darts,The darts were not included. That being said i feel the lowest rating is only adequate. The label on the package said the board shipped from a return center....
4,really good value,"Really good board for the price. Works very well with regular darts, but not so much with throwing knives or air gun darts because of the wiring, which you can't remove."
2,No darts,"The dart board is fine, but it was supposed to come with two sets of darts. It did not. Order a less expensive board and buy your darts separately."
4,Great Buy,"Great board. My roommates and I play all the time. We get bounce outs every once in a while but only because it hits the metal wiring. And some of the metal wiring(around the bullseye) is coming lose but it goes back in easy. The darts it comes with are satisfactory with me (amatuer dart player), although the plastic breaks when getting hit by other darts. I already purchase new darts and they are en route.Overall, this product is great for leisure dart playing."
4,Pretty good dartboard from a novice perspective,"Pretty good dartboard here. Holes from dart tips do actually ""heal"" themselves over time, or if you massage the hole. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because there are a lot of staples holding down the rings. Pretty minor, however you can purchase more expensive boards without the staples. Rotatable outer ring lets you rotate the board for more even wear over time. The Darts are very basic but will get you up and running in no time. Great value here!"
4,Halex 64750 Tournament Bristle Dartboard,Great dartboard for Senior adults. Young Adults are looking for the electronic board. Don't be disappointed if the young adults do not participate.
2,"okay for the price, but...","bought this dart board about a week ago, and its pretty much what i expected for the price. first, the darts that come with it are pretty low quality. i broke 4 of the 6 plastic shafts the first night i played with them. after about a week of heavy use on the board (3-4 hours a night) the spider (metal wiring) is very heavily bent making the board pretty much unplayable. seems like it would be okay for lighter use, but if you are buying it for more then just light use, you might want to invest in a higher quality board to get your moneys worth."
4,Decent Dart Board for the Price,"This board is my first real dart board. I was tired of the bent and broken tips that our cheap electronic dartboard was causing for the plastic tipped darts. Also, bounce-outs were fairly common.This board is a step up from entry-level electronic boards, for sure. The darts that come with it are nothing special, but they work. There are still occasional bounce outs, but the board is holding up well after about a month of use.Also, nothing beats the nice solid ""thump"" of a dart landing in the board (it sounds much better than the plastic-on-plastic from our old board)."
1,TERRIBLE QUALITY,"Not only is this an extremely low quality board, but I can't get a refund or contact the seller!First of all, the darts broke apart easily within minutes of use. The tail things have to be put on after every single throwNext, the board appears to be cracked all over.And the darts LEAVE THE HOLES IN. THERE IS NO 'HEALING' OF THE WOOD.THE BACK OF THE BOARD CONSISTS OF ONLY A SINGLE HOLE IN THE MIDDLE.THE NUMBERS ROTATE AROUND, BUT THE METAL COMES LOOSE EASILY BECAUSE OF THE LOOSE SCREWSALL IN ALL, I GIVE THIS A 0.5 OUT OF 5.TERRIBLE QUALITYDO NOT BUYAMAZON WON'T GIVE ME A REFUND -.-"
1,not for a serious dart players,The metal sticks out to much. I bought two boards and within 3 or 4 times playing the metal starting coming out
5,A book of outstanding sports medicine patient handouts,Dr. Rouzier has written an outstanding book which is a collection of easy to read patient handouts covering a full spectrum of sports medicine problems. The format consists of a well written description of a problem followed by a very easy to read rehabilitation program. The exercises and drawings are clear and easy for patients to follow. The binding of this soft covered book is designed for photocoping. I have used this book in my practice for more then four months. Patients appreciate the handouts and the time it saves with patient visits is well worth the cost.
5,A Great Collections,"This is a great collection of sermons - great variety, great depth, great insights, so good that it leaves me yearning for more.The editors added value by providing us with pointed and precise introductions that guide us through the techniques and strcutures of the individual sermons that greatly enhances our appreciation of them.Strongly recommended."
5,Storie that come to life.,"Some of the stories are stories I've heard when I was a child. The difference seems to be that these stories have a happy ending. They are written using good English with the intention of exposing children to the use of better sentence structure. The listener is still able to use their imagination, but children will be encouraged to distinguish between good writing and bad; and still be entertained. Each story is descriptive and easy to identify with."
5,Very well made,"I got this for my three year old son for Halloween 2006 and I have to say he loved it! From a parent's point of view I thought it was very well made and stitched. Only problem I could see was one of the jacket hooks broke after he wore it playing in the house. This suit SHOULD be good it COST 70 BUCKS! lol The helmet is a rigid plastic and it really tops off the whole ensemble well. This suit looks cool too my son got so many compliments on Halloween night, I recommend the black colored one as the other looks too plain to me. I also saw some other firefighter suits on kids for Halloween that were cheaper and they looked CHEAP so if they want good stuff go for the $70 version and add a play fire extinguisher too for added effect! Enjoy!"
2,The Tops way to Weight Loss,"I joined TOPS to see if I could keep my weight down during chemotherapy. With all the steroids they pump into you I knew it was going to be tough to keep my weight off. The book gave some great information, but not enough to do on my own. C.E.A. H.O.W. works better."
3,The original was slightly better...,I have had the pulse and the original wave....lost my wave and decided to replace it with the new wave. While its a good tool it lacked a few things from the original...the scissors is smaller...the wire stripper and cutter are much duller and the overall quality of and the feel of the metal seems below par with the original....One other thing...I REALLY miss the mini screw driver...it wasn't as small as the micro one in new one but it was used more for smaller jobs. There is now no in between for the micro and the small flat head.nonetheless...the new wave will definitely serve your needs as my old faithful did...
5,My new favorite sidekick,"I deployed with this tool. This tool has just enough of what I need to do the little jobs I need it to do without all the extra, unnecessary bells and whistles. It's my new favorite sidekick."
2,Not up to Leatherman standards.,"Let me first state that I'm a huge Leatherman fan. I've tried the Gerber mulitool, as well as the SOG, and Leatherman is the standard by which all others are gauged. This tool, however, doesn't stand up the the Leatherman legacy. Here are the shortcomings: The screwdriver bits are prone to getting lost, the retention mechanism just doesn't function well. The saw blade uses different mechanism, but it doesn't function well either. The internal sleeves which provide support and tension to the tools bind and bend easily. The scissors (not a feature I was excited about anyway) don't work. I was excited about the blades being outside, but found that I still reached for my pocket knife instead of my Leatherman for standard cutting tasks. I would NOT recommend this tool to a friend, instead I would direct him or her to a Leatherman Supertool 300, or for more casual users, the Leatherman Blast. Personally, I'm switching to the 300."
4,New Wave Multi-tool,"Nice bit of kit but not as ""multi"" as I had expected. Various models and options can be confusing - difficult to price shop - but what else is new? What is included is to a very high standard and should last for a very long time indeed."
3,handy toy,this is realy good multi-tool idea and it's easy to use only thing it was made from a non tool grade material and it is easy to damage during a regular use... for me it still a good piece of pocket tool but cause of quality it is definitively overpriced cause the brand or so... :) I would like to have same but a bit more durable. ;)

5,supergift,"I gave it for my husband *TEN* years ago, for his birthday. I think it is probably the best gift I ever gave him, at least it is the most used. It is still in good condition and was helpful in more than one ocasion."
5,The perfect Multi -Tool,"Started off with the Surge- just too heavy for a multi tool in my opinion. This is the Surge but lighter. It's perfect. I have used this multi tool for several years and it has never failed me. When in the field, I have this riding in the sheath pocket of my SOG Field Pup and it's the combo that I rely on when in the backcountry.My review on the Surge:""All in all a great multi tool! I have used a few different models and this one is the best so far. Very functional, accessible, and user friendly. Blades keep an edge and are very sharp. Plyers are great. The tools on it are very good and some of the best scissors I have seen on a multi tool. One draw back. This thing is heavy. Unusually heavy for a multitool."""
5,great quality!,this is one solid multi-tool. first one for me to actually purchase so i dont have much to compare it to but i know quality and this tool is made very solid!
2,very hard to use,The hinged are very stiff it is hard to open and close it to access the pliers. The tools on the inside are so stiff it hurts to take them out. Other than that it works fine.
5,A wonderful multitool,"I have ownd a Wave for several years now, and really like it. It's large size gives it a robust feel, and the knife and pliers are sturdy and get the job done. The other tools see less frequent use, but I *have* used all of them at some point, and all successfully at that."
5,Leatherman wave is the best!,"I love these multi-tools! Unless you lose one, they will last forever. If something breaks, you just send it into the factory, and they will replace part or entire tool - turn around is about 2 weeks. I highly recommend this tool, and will buy another if this gets lost!"
3,Not all it was cracked up to be,"So, i got the Leatherman Wave today and at first everything was fine. Then i took a closer look and noticed the handle was angled by the external tools in such a way that they only rested on the liner lock and the part of the bushing that was closest to the center was the only part of it that was in touch with both blade and handle. I figured this wasn't a problem until i tried opening it and the material of the tool scraped against the handle.I don't know if all of the Waves are like this but for that price i expect a bit more, especially since the edges on the handle were sharper than the blade.I've contacted leatherman regarding this and if it's just a fluke i'll change my review accordingly. As it is the bushings won't last 5 years and since it can be considered ""normal wear"" it would be possible that it's not covered by the warranty."
4,Leatherman Wave,"Well, I'm happy. It's not the kind of thing I use all of the time, but I've got two knives, a saw, a file, some screwdrivers, scissors, etc., all at hand. I got the Wave at something between $50 and $55. I guess the top of the line is the Charge, the one with the Titanium or Aluminum frame, which saves you some weight, with about the same tools. The Wave is somewhat heavy ... I wouldn't want it in my pocket or even on my belt. But the Charge costs over $100, and I didn't want to spend that much on what is really an experiment, as I've never owned a multi-tool before."
5,Great Quality,"I always hesitate to order clothing from anywhere because you can't see the actual quality of the merchandise. Finding the exact band your photo you want might prove difficult, so sometimes you have to take a chance. I found these shirts to be great quality and the images silk-screened not iron-ons. (they'll last years longer). The image itself is clear, front and back. The shirt itself is sturdy and thick. I've washed it about 10 times so far and it hasn't shrunk. My son loves it; I'll be ordering more if I can't find something he wants at the local places. Sizing is accurate as well--they aren't ""slim cut"" or overly large."
4,"I must admit, it was a genre twister....","and it managed a lot of humour in there. At couple of times it lost continuity for another slapstick gag, but overall it kept integrity, consistency and, best of all, managed a heck of a lot of laughs. I loved the reversal of the Hitchhiker characters too -- good to see a spunky robot. I think that scifi-based humour is hard so give Mr. Haynes the credit he is due and read the book."
3,Rather long,"I found this amusing all the way through and it was an interesting concept with a daft spaceship owner and some slightly more clever robots. I actually found that I warmed more to the robots, particularly Clunk, who tried to act as his conscience directed without hurting anyone. The problem I found with this book is that I thought it would be a good short story but the length of the book did not maintain the humour. There were particularly funny parts where modern references for example to a chain of coffee shops which out of context were very funny.In summary a fun read but I don't think I will read the rest of series."
2,What?,"I thought it was supposed to be funny. I'm about six chapters in, and I don't think so. I've put it down."
2,The Problem with Hal is he's unlikable as well as inept,"Imagine Red Dwarf with a cast consisting only of Rimmer and Kryten, take away most of their character traits and personality, and you'd approximately have Hal Spacejock and Clunk."
3,A bit too long for my tastes,"Hal Spacejock is an interesting story. Being mainly a comedy, it's really going to depend on your personal tastes if you like this or not.Unfortunately for me, as it went on, my opinion of it went down. At 4,572 locations, it just felt too long. For this sort of humor, shorter would have worked better for me. As an example, it feels like the entire casino section could have been taken out with no real harm to the story.Clunk and the Navcom are the stars to me. How Hal could have survived at all, is hard to believe, without Clunk to save him.Still, free, so give it a try."
1,Not remotely funny,"Ok - whoever compared this book to ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" never actually read Hitchhiker. I got maybe halfway through the book before I gave up. Hal is just plain stupid and not one other character is even remotely likeable.My advice is to stay far away from this series. A waste of time and money."
4,"If you're a space fiction fan and like humor, try this one!","Loving this book! Humorous, witty dialogue. Hal reminds me of a slightly sloppy Han Solo - his luck hasn't been so great and he has money troubles and a piece of junk spaceship. Instead of Chewie, his onboard computer is his companion and it rips him frequently which is hilarious. Against his will he winds up with another companion, a good natured robot named Clunk. Hal becomes a pawn in a game being played out by a couple of greedy business rivals trying to get the best of each other when he takes a job to pay his debts. A loan collector who has threatened Hal already for his own debts gets involved in the game to try to better his finances too. I'm glad this is a series and I can look forward to more books!"
3,"In space, no-one can hear you laugh","Can't believe I have had this in my reading pile for over five years. I picked in up in Oz back in June 2006 and it kind of buried itself in my pile of books.It's not bad and the author does show potential. It took a while to get going, initially I was slightly underwhelmed but by the end I discovered I had grown more fond of Hal and Clunk then I was expecting.It's slapstick space humour with a daft cago pilot and a sidekick robot that is slightly less daft. Here they try to transport a dodgy cargo in a ship that is barely spaceworthy and mayhem is the order of the day.So it grows on you and it does have some very nice moments. Not Douglas Adams yet though."
2,"it's ok for a free book, but crummy if you paid a cent","really it's not worth much more than for eyeball back and forth exercises, but it was free. The author relies on the entire story as being a constant stream of wise cracks. it gets old. it never gets creative. not a satisfying sci fi. Hardly worth the time to get this free book.."
3,For younger readers in early teens,"I was looking for something a little more stimulating, but didn't find it. The name should have clued me in, so I blame myself. For a younger audience, this is probably quite good - lighthearted adventure story told in a clean way. This is a good novel to buy as a present for a younger relative.Hal is a clueless freighter pilot unable to manage his ship or finances. He blunders from one disaster to another and with debt collectors, portmasters and starvation on his tail, manages to triumph only through some assistance from some aged robots."
2,I just couldn't finish this one,"The story starts out good, but then just goes off into weirdness. I couldn't finish the book it got too weird for me."
4,Good Sci Fi book,I liked this book. The various plot lines kept it interesting. I hope that there will be a follow up book.
4,Great read for the price.,This book is very funny. The first 2/3 of the book flows very well and makes you want to read one more page but the last 1/3 just goes on too long. I do recommend this book and i have bought the next volume.
1,Not my kind,After a chapter I realized that this was not my kind of book to continue. I knew there was a robot but thought I would try. The humor didn't hit me either. I feel bad giving this review because others find this book entertaining so take it for what it's worth.
1,"Outrageous, not funny","I had to give up on this novel before I was even halfway through. It is outrageously unbelievable, which would be acceptable if it were actually funny, but it failed to do more than make half-smile once or twice."
4,Helped Me Get My MSCE,"This book was a definite help in passing one of my tests. I admit, I have bought several books and this one came in a package deal. If you read it-you will pass. As with all books designed to help the reader take a test, you get out what you put in. The information IS there!"
2,Buy The Chihuahua Handbook by Caroline Coile Instead,"This book provides an adequate level of information about chihuahuas, but if you're really looking for a book that will answer ALL of your questions, buy _The Chihuahua Handbook_ by Dr. Caroline Coile instead. It's more well written than this book, and it provides greater detail in a wide variety of subjects, and includes more up-to-date information on subjects such as diet, breeding, training, etc.,. Kim Thornton's _Your Chihuahua's Life_ treats the chihuahua like it's just a smaller version of any other dog, and any chihuahua owner knows that's just not true. Do yourself a favor, and buy the other book."
5,Best Chihuahua book out there,I have purchased four of these books and given three away. I can't believe it went out of print. Very good articles about and four chihuahuas not just cut and paste from other dog books or meant for a general breed. Really a cutom written about and for Chihuahuas. I have collected many books but still use it as a reference. I have been involved with a national rescue group for over seven years.
1,Garbage,"This lock was purchased for my sons P.E. locker; it began to stick after only a month, then progressively became more difficult to lock. Now it does not work at all! Wasted money...very unhappy with this lock."
5,a must read story,"Peter Mars did a great job with this novel. It is an exciting quick read ending with an unexpected twist. A story to read again and again, just to pick out details you may have missed the first time through! Great work Peter!"
4,receiver not tested yet,The receiver turns on when plugged in but I cannot test it until a special Direct TV card is installed. My old one is still working and the one I bought is a reserve.
3,double timer,I do like the fact that there is a normal timer on one side and an additional one on the other side. I just wish the other one was a little easier to set up for timing.
5,best ever,"a must for any electrician, great for breaker panels and motor cans where retrieving a dropped screw could be fatal"
1,m item hasnt been shiped in8 days,"this is awful service , they never shipped my item ive been charged and its 8 days the item status is not shipped yet!i bought other products from other sellers same day i received all of them but this one is still not shipped status...worse customer service , they havent even contact or explain the reason"
4,Industry standard,"Good holding drivers. Not designed for breaking loose or tightening screws. Use regular driver for that. A must for any ""real""Electrician or I/E Tech. Good price. Little bulky. Fair feel. Satisfied customer"
2,Not for small screws...,"I work with electronics, and I thought that at least the smaller screwdriver would work for me...If your working with 2-56 screws, the smaller screwdriver will not work for you!"
1,Review On Medical choice ina Mexican Village,"This book displays an in depth analysis on a tiny Mexican village on how people make their medical decisions. The authors did a superb job on analyzing intricate details. However, the level of this book is beyond the average reader. If one is not familiar with statistics and the medical anthropology jargon used here, then it is basically worthless to read this book. It is so dry that one would have a better time chewing cardboard. However, if medical anthropology is your cup of tea, then the book may just be the thing you need to explore the world of Mexican curers and phyisicians."
4,Still need some improvement for Asian heads,"Although the helmet is labeled universal fit, it still needs some improvement for Asian heads. However, it is a good helmet. I always trust Bell Venture series. A friend of mine fell off from a slope while riding wearing bell venture, the helmet was totally broken, and he was totally fine. Because that example, I kept this helmet although it is not totally comfortable.Do not be mislead, here I mean the helmet is fine for my head, but not totally comfortable as expected. I have higher standard on that I think. Anyway, I think the helmet worth 4 stars"
1,what about price?,"The vendor has advertised that these are available from ""$23.43"". There are no helmets available at this price, however- perhaps the vendor should be persuaded to advertise the correct price so that shoppers do not waste their time!"
2,Helmet Cost,This is a great helmet but not worth $37.00 I found the same helmets in Target (different brand) f0r 19.99.
4,Nice helmet for a great price!,"I needed a replacement helmet for my Giro that was about 15 years old and disintegrating. Since I only ride about once a week now, I did not want anything exotic or expensive.This is a very nice helmet at a low price point. I've worn it on 2 rides so far and find that it is light and fairly comfortable. I dont like the strap buckle as it is tricky to operate, but I suppose I'll get used to it.I am not sorry I bought this, and would buy it again."
4,Everything I expected,"This is my first bike helmet and I am thoroughly pleased with it. The fit is really the most important thing. The adjustable dial in the back of the helmet allows it to fit my head perfectly. The chin straps are also adjustable allowing for more or less room around the ears and neck. For the price you can't beat it. Although, I would recommend going to a sports store and trying a few helmets on. For me, this fit as well as the more expensive ones, but it was not as glitzy."
3,Pretty decent book - Must read for any serious hypnotist!,I read this book years ago and still occasionally refer back to it. Elman's big claim to fame is that he came up with a pretty good induction. I think that everyone that works in Hypnosis should learn it. It's very quick and very effective. The rest of the book really is of a bunch of Elman's case studies it was very interesting to read about how he would work.I'm a big Erickson fan so I'm obviously a little biased in what I like but I still recommend anyone that is interested in Hypnosis purchase and read this book.
5,Best explanation of hypnosis I know of,"Good points: clear and credible. Best explanation of hypnosis I have read so far. Lots of applications with personal stories. The author focuses on dentistry and medical applications, a bit of psychotherapy too.So-so points: the author repeats itself. A bit boring, but the reader probably ends up remembering more of it"
5,The bible for hypnosis,The is the definitive book on hypnosis. A must read for practitioners and those interested in the field.
1,O.K But only Scrapes the surface of what you need to know,"O.K But only Scrapes the surface of what you need to know.Seriously for around the same price you can get a bookthat is almost double the size and will actually teachyou everything that you need to know to become a trulysuccessful hypnotherapist.Personally I'd advise you to take a look at this bookinstead as its far more comprehensive in what it teachesThe Encyclopedia of Hypnotherapy, Stage Hypnosis & Complete Mind Therapy"
5,"Dave Elman's ""Hypnotherapy"" made me a better therapist","I had study Psychology and have had my Private Practice for many years. Wanting to add a more efficient dimension to my practice, I investigated many different techniques. I did not find what I was looking for. In my search, I took a short course in Hypnotherapy, but the study book was Dave Elman's ""Hypnotherapy"". Once I read the book I recognized that I had found a real treatise on the subject. I read it from cover to cover and implemented into my practice all that I found in the book. To my amazement my clients began to progress in short order. To this day I keep my worn copy on my desk and review it often. I recommended it to any therapist searching for more efficiency in his practice."
1,It's a rip off.,"Author has no idea what he is writing about. Absolutly unrealistic approch to hypnotherapy. Plain lies about teaching hypnotherapy to ""thousands of doctors and dentists"". Silly use of ""medical terminology"" - at least he could check with medical dictionary, but he didn't. And there is no need for references to support my statements. Just randomly open any page."
3,"Measures 10.5"" x 6.5""","Not bad, padding is thick, but a couple of issues you should be aware of:- Padding is much thicker near the back than at the front, so you may need to adjust the angle of your seat.- The surface that comes in contact with the bike seat has rubber nubs on it, but it is nevertheless quite slippery. I added a sheet of non-slip rug pad between the cover and the seat, and it helped.- The dimensions are not listed in description, It measures about 10.5"" long by 6.5"" wide. It looks like it could adjust to a wide range of bike seat sizes though.- The spring loaded drawstring closure is weak, plan on throwing it away and tying a knot."
1,Does not fit a stationary bike,This does not fit a stationary bike seat as advertised. Nice and cushy so I'm sure it will work on a regular bicycle.
4,Comfortable,I bought this seat because I have a very hard seat and it helped out. The only defect is that in one month I had to sew it because the front part came undone a bit.
5,Pleases my butt,"First off, I put this on my girlfriend's Gary Fisher Tarpon. It's 3 times more comfortable as before. The gel gives very good support to the rear part of your ""end"" (Area closer to your tailbone). I use the Bell Contour gel seat cover but find this Bell Relief one more to be more comfortable. Unlike other reviews, I found the seat cover quite tight/stable. It has that rubber like surface on the bottom that grips on to your original seat pretty well. Given no seat cover can stay 100% without any movement at all, this one stays on your seat perfectly fine. If you feel it shifts too much, tie a knot with the two strings around the seat post for extra security. I recommend this seat cover for anyone who likes doing light trail/dirt or just road biking."
3,Not for Spin Class Beginners,"I would not necessarily recommend this to any beginners in spin class, which is the original reason why I bought it. It provides minor cushioning but perhaps I expected a little more than it was made for."
3,meh,"The thing I don't like at all about this seat cushion is the flat slippery underside. It's like the bottom of those old-fashioned furry slippers that're just plastic dots on a stiff plastic surface. As a result the seat cover slips around on top of the seat, which is pretty annoying. I was hoping for something with better grip for the price (20 bucks) but then again, some covers go for more than twice that amount. The cushion itself is alright"
3,Not as comfortable as I thought it would be,"While places increased pressure of the bones are best reinforced, the gel is not as smooth as I imagined it would be."
4,"Great for spin class, not road.",I used this for my spin class initially. I have since gotten used to the spin bikes and no longer needed it. Tried it on my street bike and did not like it all. Husband did not like it at all on his seat.
4,Great for getting used to riding regularly,"I bought a really nice hybrid bike last summer, and it rides like a dream... but OW my sit-bones. The pain was so bad that I didn't want to keep riding and trying to get used to it. I tried padded shorts - no help, and they are pricy.I figured for $15, why not try a gel seat cover - then I don't have to worry about whether or not my padded shorts are clean. And - it really helps! I still have minor pain in my sit-bones, but I did ride 2 days before trying the gel seat cover, so it may have been residual. I don't think it made it much worse.I only rode about 4.5 miles - and it was good for that distance. Towards the end though I started feeling a little numb though, so I give this 4 stars because I don't think it'll be good for very long rides. But for starting out and gradually getting used to riding, it really helps."
2,Bell has apparently changed the design of this seatpad (for the worse).,"I first bought a Bell Gel Fusion + seatpad many months ago. I still have it and it's very comfortable. I just bought another one the other day since I let my nephew use mine because he just learned to ride, and it is quite a different seatpad than the first one. It seems identical, with the depression in the middle, but it would barely fit my bike seat after much stretching. It is also noticeably firmer than the first seat, particularly on the sides of the depression. This makes it uncomfortable. I don't know if Bell still sells the version I bought before (I bought the new one at Wal*Mart). I plan to try to find a used one that was made a couple of years ago or so."
3,alright kinda pricey,i got this seat recently and it works alright. more comfortable then my last seat so i guess its alright
1,Seat Cushions do nothing comfortable for the rider!,"WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!! I bought this cushion, becasue the seat that came on my cycle was very small for my large bottom! LOL!! I am an amateur cyclist doing alot of MS150 and charity riding. When I started, like everybody I was very saddle sore and thought I needed padding. What people dont realize is experience brings caluses and with that seat cushion, it negates the caluses and also cuts off blood flow. When this happens you then experience numbness and tingling in your lower extremities. Common sense would tell you that that is not a good thing for long distance cycling. Eat you wheaties and tought through it. Also, the cheap drawstring that holds in onto your seat breaks so quicly, that you might as well buy a cushioned ""Granny"" seat before wasting your money that is going to fly off a quarter into any long ride! WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!!"
1,Hated it!!,"I bought this to use in Spin classes at the gym but experienced one of my most uncomfortable classes ever as a result. First, it barely fit on the seat. My primary complaint, however, is that the gel in the back half of the cover is quite a bit thicker than the gel in the front...this essentially put me on a slope. If I let go with one hand to grab my water or tried to sit up straight, the seat would essentially propel me forward -- my pelvis would tilt at an awkward angle and I'd have to grab onto the handles to keep from losing my balance. It wasn't too bad when I was leaning forward resting on the handles, but even then I had to be careful to not slide forward and down the slope of the seat cover. As far as I'm concerned, it was money wasted and I'll never use it again!! I'd rather go without a gel cover at all. Maybe I'll leave it at the gym and hope someone steals it."
2,unconfortable,"this seat cover, makes you slip on the seat to the front constantly....... you keep pushing yourself to the back and its very annoying, almost wanting to bend the seat in order to stay in place... I bought it to avoid placing my intimate parts directly on the spinning bike seat, in case it hasnt been cleaned properly but I hate it so much, I rather use CLOROX wipes instead to clean the seat thoroughly before I use it..."
4,Great Seat Cover,"Bought this seat cover to fit over the hard seat at the gym for spinning classes. Prior to this seat cover, I used one that I got at Dicks Sporting Goods. That seat didn't help, so I tried this one. It has twice the padding of the other seat cover and feels like the real deal in comparison to my other cover. Took my first spin class with it and I have zero pain or discomfort in my sit bone area. I totally reccommend this cover. You won't be sorry if you order it. I am looking forward to my spinning classes now ... no pain from sitting. YAY!"
1,broken,We have had this futon frame for less than a year and it is broken just from everyday use. What a waste of money.
3,Purchase Review,"I purchased this futon with a mattress. The futon is lower than I expected and a section of the arm was broken. While the piece was able to be fixed, I did voice my disappointment to the company and was given a small refund on my purchase. I appreciate the company acknowledging my concerns and doing right by their customers. Now my son loves the futon vs a bed in his room so it's ok with it. So it works for us in the end."
4,very pleased,"I ordered this futon for my husbands ""man cave"" I wanted black, I wanted flat arm rest, and I really like the extra supprot beam in the center of the seating part of the futon. When the box arrived - it was banged up quite a bit and there were a few holes in the box. I was instantly worried and so was my husband when he saw the box. But we opened it up and layed all the parts out - and we were only missing a couple of screws - which were easly purschased at our local hardware store. the futon is up and is quite comfortable. we have sat on it and like it very much. Our 3 dogs like it also :) before this futon was bought - all 3 of them fought for a place in his recliner:) so we are ""very pleased with this purchase from us:)"
2,personality,"As in opera, you can sing the notes or feel the character and have a stage presence even on audio. Ko-Ko sings beautifully but, in my opinion, was not meant to. This Ko-Ko has no personality. This is a major problem."
2,Accurate but hard to apply,"This book has a wealth of information about the complexities and nuances of matchpoint bridge. However, I found it to be rather difficult to extract from it many concrete rules or thought processes to use in making decisions at the table. It has lots of examples of what to do to get the best score but insufficient breakdown of the things to analyze to make the right choices.I have not yet found a better book on this subject, but I feel that I got little out of this one."
2,Very technical book,"I bought this book because I expected it to be like other books by the Dalai Lama. It's very technical & scientific, and I couldn't get into it at all. Too much science & technology-not enough Dalai Lama. I gave it away to someone who could understand it."
4,"good, simple listening with a few pleasant surprises","I bought this CD because of one song, The Streets of London, which is a nice, folksy and very singable tune. The rest of the album has been a pleasant surprise, with folksongs whose melodies blend into each other in a soothing background way.That is, until you really listen to the lyrics and find that each song tells its own sometimes touching, sometimes quirky, generally 60's-flavored story. It's not exactly jump-up-and-grab-you music, but it's pleasant in an undemanding and sincere way, with some really nice folk guitar sounds as well."
1,Triton,"This was possibly the worst SPongebob special episode. The commercials said that Triton was evil, but he was punished for helping humans- which ultimately makes Neptune the evil one. There was no plot and it was completely stupid. Don't buy this."
5,does the job nicely,"Price was the main reason I purchased this fireplace poker. Not the most attractive thing in the world, it was made quickly and cheaply and it shows but if it was a big deal it could be fixed with a file in just a few mins. However, for something you are gonna poke in a fire does it really matter. I got this for my backyard fire pit and have no reservations about leaving it out in the weather and really like the extra length - but this may prove a little long for use in most indoor fireplaces."
1,Crappy Metal - Tip Broke off.,"The tip and the handle are loosely threaded on, but that not too big a deal. It's made out of a crappy metal. The tip broke off after a few uses."
4,Perfectly serviceable fire poker,"I bought this for taking camping so I had a better means to move fire logs around than finding a tree branch or other stick to do it. This has been a much better solution. It's sturdy and well made, and I have no quality concerns about it, despite what other reviewers have said. For my application, I have found that the prong that is higher up is about useless in it's location, so I only end up using the end one. I wish it was forked at the end for better grippage, because grabbing a log with essentially a pencil point is a bit challenging. But it works well enough for me to get a lot of good usage out of it during our camping trips."
5,Perfect Gift!,I purchased this poker as a Christmas gift for my son. He has a fire pit in his yard and I noticed tree limbs sticking out of the pit that he was using for a poker. It was one of the largest gifts under the tree so it sparked some attention. He laughed when he opened it and loves it. I'm sure it will get lots of use. Good quality poker!
1,Total crap,"I received the rod. The handle was falling off when received. Threads on both rod and in handle were completely gone that it screws on. I elected to try are repair it wrather than return it. Handle hole had to be drilled to a larger size Handle was cheap pot metel and barely took threads, then had to re-thread rod to match it. I wish I had spent more and got a good one."
3,Disappointed,The picture shown is not what the poker looks like. The poker end is not straight like the picture shows and the handle is not round. False advertising. I was hoping to be able to poke it into the ground to stand it up when not in use. It is a nice heavy duty poker but not what I expected.
5,Surprised,I was expecting much for the price. This was a very good buy. I use this now in place of the poker in the expensive set
3,Look for Karate Jutsu,"The above reviewer is correct. I bought Karate Jutsu and was not sure if it was the same as To-te Jutsu, so I went to the martial arts store and looked inside To-te Jutsu. The names are different because of the timing of when the book came out, I think? I think the name of Karate changed from Ryu Kyu Kempo, to To-te Jutsu, to Karate Jutsu? Although Karate Jutsu has fewer pages, it is because they fit 2 photos on one page instead of just one. If you are wondering if all 10 Katas from the To-te Jutsu are in Karate Jutsu, they are. In both books, the first 3 katas are fully illustrated and the other 7 are accompanied with 2-3 photos and the rest of the Kata described in detail. Although I liked To-te Jutsu's cover, I am very happy I bought Karate Jutsu. The binding is better and so is the wording. Please look at the reviews for Karate Jutsu, some of those reviews were very good."
3,An early basic guide to karate by Funakoshi.,"This book is an early and inferior text of the original Karate-Jutsu by Funakoshi. Though this text covers mostly the same material, the photographs and text are not as clear and organized as Karate-Jutsu. It covers the basic techniques and katas but many of the photos are incomplete making this book of dubious value. In conclusion, the value of this book is its historical importance as it relates to the early development of karate.Rating: 3 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Shotokan Karate Self-Defense Techniques: Combat Karate for the street manual)."
5,Great!,"The original Skyway Tuff Wheel (with updated bearings). After I cracked my kid's tuffwheel by running it over, the custom vintage BMX bike his uncle pieced together for him was incomplete. I searched high and low for a replacement rim, and found not only that you had the exact product but also at a great price. In order to fit the rim in the forks, I did have to shave the outer nuts that lock the inner nuts outside the bearings. The older cone-style bearings used to have the thinner nut for a slimmer profile. I expected as much from the product photo, so no surprises there. Thanks for a great, hard-to-find product. My kid is back in action."
3,"Great book, not so great translation","This is a wonderfully written novel. I spent the past year writing about this book for my senior thesis, so I pretty much know it inside out. The language is beautiful and Buitrago is a master a combining wit, parody, dark comedy, and sexual longing into one coherent and compelling narrative. However, I don't think that this translation does it justice. The language is clunky, and loses a lot of the brilliance and tone that make the original so special. Even the English title is a poor choice in my opinion (I would have chosen the more literal and more sensual ""The Woman of Honey""). Overall, it's a beautiful novel, but I would suggest reading it the original Spanish if possible (Spanish title - ""Señora de la miel"")."
1,Bush league in every way!,"I searched all over for a review of this dvd before purchasing it, butwhen i could find none I decided to take a chance an pick it up.That is why I am writing this review for other interested buyers---Caveat Emptor--buyer beware!!This dvd appears to be home-made withfootage culled and edited from old NFL films shows featuring JimBrown that someone recorded off of TV on videotape and transfered to dvd.All dialogue has been replaced by generic music and the quality of thetransfer is so muddy that it is hard to tell just who is running with theball.The DVD artwork is also home-made (poorly at that), and the length of thevideo is 42 minutes, not 60 as the product information states.I would love to see an official NFL films release on Jim Brown, but thisis not even close!"
2,Not great,"This book was so boring, it took everything inside me to finish it. The romance parts are not enticing, and the action parts are cheesy."
5,The only police book which actually teaches new things,"This work is outstanding. It encompasses a complete breakdown of management theory in just a few pages. It covers both structured and unstructured assesment style exams. My one complaint, is that the book isn't long enough! (296 pages) Well worth the money."
1,Thanks but no thanks!,This book was of little help. Due to the information this book gave I failed my Lt. exam
2,not a favorite,Some times you win and really enjoy a movie this one I did not win. Not a favorite for me.
2,story of an abusive marriage,"Anytime a movie is made from a classic, the people who have no taste of their own but want to appear as if they do, praise the movie to the skies.The fact is that at one-and-a-half hours, this could have been an okay, three-star movie. At two-and-a-half hours, it is excruciating, like sitting through a sermon that drones on and on, making the same point over and over again.In spite of the suggestion of grand houses, this gives every indication of being a very low-budget production: close-ups of the same few rooms, none of the sweep and pagentry of other period movies, minimal music, adequate but not great photography. The location shots of the moors (few in number) are the visual highlight of this WGBH effort.Bottom line: if you're still curious, talk your local library into getting it, then borrow it free."
4,Good but slow,This movie fits the vein of the typical drama of this era. It was somewhat slow moving but I liked it.
1,We Threw It Away,"I know it's a classic and by Ann Bronte, but it is horribly sad and hard to watch. It is also too graphic with adult content for my taste.We ended up throwing our copy away.I think I'll stick to ""Jane Eyre"" or ""Wuthering Heights"" if I want a Bronte movie."
4,The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"I greatly enjoy BBC movies of the classics, and this did not disappoint. You do want to make the time to watch, or you could find yourself getting lost by splitting your attention. Give yourself an afternoon or evening and enjoy."
2,BBC drama,"I enjoy the genre of BBC's period pieces however not all are great, good or even pretty good. This particular drama was depressing and not really entertaining. The background was dard and dreary all the time and the heroine was the same all the way thru. Boring would describe it. I wouldn't watch it again."
5,"When hope is gone, a friend is around the corner","At first there was a great marital relationship between the two couples. He refused to acknowledge that his wife had dignity. Her kindness and compasion was not important to him. He was very bold and ungrateful. Stolen from her happiness and feeling betrayed, forced her to leave the house with their son. I am glad this movie had a decent ending."
3,"Good story, well told.","The story starts out quite mysteriously and there is heavy speculation surrounding a new neighbor. The story goes on to unfold via flashbacks and it is quite riveting. I feel that the story builds and builds and then never quite reaches a peak. It kind of just peters out. I also think the relationship between our hero and heroine isn't fully developed. You never really understand why this lovely man falls in love with this brusque, unfriendly, unsmiling young woman. Should have been more there to make the relationship understandable. All told, a good story."
3,Ends Well,"I enjoyed it, I didn't care for the sort of sexual overtones and some physical abuse. I think overall it was well done. Her husband the part was acted so well, I found myself saying How could that guy be so horrid? That's good acting when they get you to enter in the story."
3,A bit dark for me,"Although I've never considered the book particularly dark,at times situations are bleak while character is being built and challenges overcome. Here in the movie version of the tale,however,there seems to be a focus on all the dark challenges while minoring on the beautiful character outcomes that grow from making honorable choices. Too bad. The actors and sets are great."
2,Look for something else,Very boring story line. Didnt even finish the movie. Very poor quality CD as well. Regret this purchase!!
1,Misleading,This movie was purchased for my teenage daughter. What a mistake. The movie is divided into parts. Part 1 is fine. I had to turn off the movie in part 2. This is a violent and graphic depiction of the story. It was disturbing to say the least.
1,junk,perhaps the actors are ok...the actress not well chosen and not well portrayed - very badly done ado not recommend at all...
3,"Good, but could've been better","I love reading a book then watching the movie. I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down. The movie, in most parts, follows the book except for a few scenes with the young Arthur and the ending. The movie, in my opinion, could've been better if the story was more developed with her life with her husband besides all the abuse. I found myself very depressed with the movie afterwards. It is a sad story and they did a good job portraying the abusive husband, but I felt they focused so much on that they left out a lot of the story with other characters from the book. Of course with a movie this usually happens since it's only a couple of hours long."
4,Good but there is something missing,"I enjoyed this film BUT there is something about Tara Fitzgerald that always comes across as extremely cold. I understand that for the most part it was required in her role in this film still, I think it was difficult for her to ever really warm up. Having said that, I thought she did very well in this film and the male leads were very good."
4,PG-13,"I was surprised at how graphic this video was. I enjoyed the movie, but it was interrupted frequently when my kids kept coming in. Be warned - it is highly suggestive with frequency!"
3,The story's great...beware DVD quality,"I wholeheartedly recommend this miniseries, but was surprised to discover that the DVD quality was very poor. The picture looked like a low-resolution transfer, and it's an irregular 14:9 aspect ratio, which required a zoom setting on the TV. (Further reducing picture quality.) I expected the disc to be the same quality as other BBC DVDs. It's not.It's still a great costume drama, though. I love that it explores marriage, not just romance. And the acting, direction and cinematography are very good."
4,Well done reading of Robert Service,"The poetry of Robert Service is simple, full of humor and a test of the Yukon during the gold rush. Buckwheat does a fantastic job in bring the poems to life.Every now and then I will listen to this set of works and I do not get tired of them, even when I know the punch lines to the humor poems I still listen and laugh."
1,Poor resistance,"I got this to try and add some exercise to my mostly sedentary profession. After a couple of weeks, the resistance failed. It just uses a screw and friction to add resistance (I dont' really know what I was expecting). Once it wears down, there's a limit to how tight the screw will hold it. Not really worth it."
4,Pedal Pusher,"We got the Duro-Med Pedal Exerciser for my wife. She has recently had knee replacement surgery and it is working fine. It not only gives her exercise, but it is helping to keep the knee flexible and it building up the leg muscles. Delivery was also on time. It is simple and easy to put together. For someone like me withfive thumbs that was definitely a plus. One of these days I may even get to use itmyself."
3,It's okay for a low end pedal exerciser.,"The pedal exercise arrived and was assembled within fifteen minutes. Came with its own wrench to put it together. It was pedaled by foot for ten minutes and held up well. The tension system heats up when you want more resistance. There is a warning label, so it must get pretty hot to the touch if you were to tighten it up all the way and pedal like you were leaving the fiery pit of hell the first chance you got. That has me concerned a bit of what is going on inside the tensioner body. If it lasts a year (for the price), I'll be okay with the purchase."
4,great little bike at low cost,"Senior citizen -recovering from recent bi-lateral knee replacement - bike arrived fully assembled, is lightweight, just right for a simple daily workout to keep knees in shape-- mine does NOT slide, stays steadily in place."
3,poor quality,"Compact, easy to use, but tension control knob does not remain tight and the pedals mis-align when you tighten the knob. This causes one of the pedals to rub against the black plastic cap that covers the center of the unit and causes it to wear small pieces off of the cover. Disappointed in quality, but I guess that's why it was inexpensive."
2,No back straps,"This exerciser is fine for the arms but I bought it for my mom to use after her stroke & her feet will not stay on the pedals. It really needs a back strap to hold her feet on. For a healthy person, it works fine."
4,Duro-Med Pedal Exerciser,Have found this exerciser to be easy to use while at computer. It is sturdy and doesn't move while being pedaled. The tension adjuster is easy to manipulate. It came fully assembled except for rubber feet used to stabilize it. My legs are feeling much better and less stiff when I use the exerciser at least 3-4 times a week for short periods of time.
1,save your money,This item did not pedal smoothly. It slid all over the place. Save your money and buy a recumbent bike.
3,Pedel Exerciser,"I purchased it for use under my desk at work. It is OK for light use, but will break with heavy use. I would go for better quality if I had to purchase another one."
3,High Chair,You need to sit in a chair that is slightly higher off the ground than a regular chair to use this. If you don't your legs will cramp up.
1,Not good at all,"I boought this equipment thinking I could get a decent bike workout in on a rainy/cold day. Wrong!!! Feel is all wrong, unstable and won't stay stationary unless you push it up against something. When pedaling, it does not turn smoothly and the smell of the rubber is awful. I gave mine to Goodwill in the hopes some poor soul who can't do any better could use it. Don't buy unless you're desperate."
4,Chicken Shack Boogie!,"Great 2 CD set of rhythm and blues music from the late 40's-early 50's includes Big Joe Turner, Amos Milburn, Muddy Waters, Floyd Dixon, Eddie Cleanhead Vinson, Pee Wee Crayton, and a lot of others, there are well over twenty songs on each CD. I think I paid $11.95 for this CD brand new a few years ago, but apparently it's out of print now, since the price listed is now so astronomical."
5,"Come on, you know this movie",I had 2 and 3 and just wanted to complete my collection. I don't have to tell anyone how great this is.
4,Review,Movie was great to watch. We had a great time watching this movie. You should watch this movie also. Because I said.
4,Great start,"The first one will always be the best, no matter what series. A beautiful blu-ray copy that adds missed detail to the film. Was like seeing it again for the first time on a big screen."
3,ok,this movie was great when it came out and like most it does not hold up with time but the newest one is great
2,Men in Black instant video,"We've seen the movie before and it is a great movie, however the picture quality was awful. I paid for the HD version hoping it would be good quality but it wasn't. I was highly disappointed in that aspect."
2,House of the Dead is better,"This game is a bit short. It has a few alternate routes, where you are allowed you to choose to go left or right at certain checkpoints. But these alternate routes are very short, and do not make a big impact on the fun of the game, or the story of the game. So there is not enough replay value for you to go back to choose one of the alternate routes.House of the Dead is more interesting in that the story moves along differently depending on which rooms you go into.Confidential Mission may appear like a copycat of Virtual Cop, but I own both Virtual Cop games for Saturn and they are a lot more fun than Confidential Mission."
3,Not quite James Bond,"...buys you an arcade port of a three level shooter. Yes, I was one of the people with high hopes when I bought the gun and House Of The Dead 2 that there would be many shooters for the Dreamcast, but all there is is the aforementioned and the Saturn Virtua Cop 2 that was included in the Smash Pack. Just because Sega is the only one still making shooting games (but not making an official gun??) doesn't make this one a great game. The voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard, and the main character is a James Bond wannabe. This game can be completely finished in 2-3 hours including the training missions. It seems to use the exact same engine as HOD2 with no enhancements, but a lot less gore. This game is at most worth a rent, not a purchase. But it is significantly better than those ... titles on Playstation, so if you need an impulse purchase, do get this one."
3,For once a remake as charming as the original.,"Updated to current day, but still just as charming and enjoyable as the original. Elliott and Gibb are believable in their attraction, and the young actor who plays ""Timmy"" is engaging. It's nice to see a movie where the only villians are human foibles, and all the characters are likeable."
4,Loved this movie!,"I saw this on cable recently and truly enjoyed it. I spent about 3 weeks trying to track it down on video.Very enjoyable movie. I thought Cynthia Gibb was great in her role. It's a nice family movie. For me, it was a must-have."
4,Live and Learn!,"Cute movie, one worth watching at least every Christmas. It shows a lot about character and caring for others. I wish it was on DVD instead of VHS."
5,Great Holiday Movie,"This is one of our favorite Holiday movies. It arrived promptly and we have watched it many times. I wish it was available on DVD, but the VHS tape is better than nothing."
5,"UPDATED ""HOLIDAY AFFAIR""",This is a great remake of an old holiday favorite. The story is just as romantic as the original. I wish that someone would reissue it on DVD.
4,vhs movie,I found this movie to be in excalent condition and it gave my family and I great joy watching it.
4,A Rare Pleasure,"This hard-to-find story is really charming in a lot of ways.Wolfe is entertaining famous French chef Pierre Mondor, who asks to be take to a World Series game between the NY Giants and the Red Sox. Wolfe believes that every guest is a jewel, resting on the cushion of hospitality, and so must accept responsiblity for taking Mondor to a ball game. He is acutely uncomfortable and shows it.But then, as you can imagine, something weird happens at the game and Wolfe and Archie are in the middle of it all.""Say it ain't so, Joe"" is woven into this charming and funny story. It's not featured very often in the Wolfe catalog, and would have been great to see how A&E; would have handled it. Enjoy!"
5,UN Unquiet Grave,Another excellent book in the series. I did n't have a clue how it would end and again was surprised. A must read for anyone who enjoys a good whodunit.
5,They just keep getting better and better!,"If you've read this series in order, then you know that Louis has matured quite a bit since his early days. This book relives some of his past and it's fascinating. You won't be disappointed as this is their best one so far. And if you've read any of the previous books, then you already know what a great series it is!If you have never read this series, then you can jump right in with this book and not feel like you don't know what's going on. The story is very exciting and very suspenseful and if you like mysteries, suspense, and/or thrillers, this book has it all! You will not regret buying this book and I guarantee you will be back to get the rest of this series! Each book is better than the last one, so rest assured this is their best yet."
2,Brand New And Broken,"Lost my old Wave multi tool recently, it was one of the originals, so I decided to treat myself to one of the Wave 2 models.Straight out of the box, the scissors don't work, so it's going back. Quite honestly the quality of this tool is nothing like the original. I'm not suprised the scissors don't work, they are so small and made of such poor materials, I should think cutting anything other than a strand of cotton would be putting them under stress. The saw blade is very thin compared to the original and the sheath is a joke, I can't even close this one. These things aint cheap, especially when you throw in a few accessories. My advice, save your money, buy a screwdriver, a pair of plyers and a box cutter then take the wife out for dinner on what you save, you might get lucky and get to use your other pocket tool!"
2,Tip of plier broke,"I was really glad when I got my Leatherman Wave.I think it is a fantastic pieze og equipment.BUT I was fixing my bike, and used my leatherman wave and some other tools.I was just trying to unscrew a bolt that was very tight.And then all of a sudden one of the pliers broke, about cm (5 mm) of the tip of one of the pliers broke of ?????I was very disapointed.The pliers must be wade of some brittle material ?before the incident, I would have given the Leatherman Wave 5 stars.But I was only using the pliers, as you normaly would.So if the pliers cant stand up to this kind of work, then I can't trust this tool.Another time I will maby look into the swiss tool or something else.I want a tool that can take a beating."
5,Leatherman Wave Review,"I bought two of these, one for me and one for my son, Geology major. We are totally pleased with this purchase. We decided on the Wave because four major tools (knives and saws) can be flipped open without opening the tool. I was recently on a trip to Haiti working on a school and I borrowed a Leatherman from a fellow worker. I had previously owned a ""Knockoff"" Leatherman and was not impressed at all. There was no way I was going to spend a lot of money on a multipurpose tool when my experience had been so bad. After using a true Leatherman, I found out they really are worth the money I ordered two as soon as I got back to a computer. What else can you buy now days with a 25 year guarantee?"
5,Joseph,"This tool is fantastic. Everything in it works like a full version of it would i.e the screw driver works as well as a full screw driver. The older version of this was my first knife. They are pretty much the same thing, and it has lasted me for 7 years and counting. The only wear on it is some rust which was my fault. For this price it is an amazing deal. Buy it. I've had other multitools and they don't compare. Get it."
2,WHAT A JOKE,"Leatherman 830040 New Wave Multi-Tool with Nylon SheathI have owned various Letherman multitools for years & this one is the worst one yet, first the nylon sheath wears lousey, will not stay closed, every time I use the toilet the tool falls out, that little scrawney worthless screwdriver broke off on the second use, the wire cutter don't hold up, bends stranded copper wire instead of cutting it, after use closing the tool is a difficult task,the plier part locks up & must be pried apart to close,the standard cutting blade hold an edge & becomes useless, the phillip & straight screwdriver insert wears out too fast (cheap metal), LM discontinued an excellent multitool & replaced it with this piece of junk, shame on you Leatherman, you just lost a good customer"
3,"Nice, but flawed.","I used one of these all day today and my hand is killing me. Why? The plier is not spring loaded. Every time you want to open it you have to do it manually. Huh? I was snipping tag ends of zip ties and the process just tore up my hands. Second, when using the cutter it closes in such a way as to pinch your thumb - a lot! I have another multi-tool that IS spring loaded and the work would have gone much faster, and less painfully, if I'd remembered to bring it with me. I was considering buying one of these; I'm glad I didn't.Otherwise, it's a well-made tool. The other blades flip out easily. The locks are handy. But, as others have mentioned, I worry about the 'snag' factor if the external blades aren't completely closed.Bottom line: For sixty+ bucks, you'd think they'd incorporate a spring and make it more ergonomic."
3,Wrong Sheath,"The photo for the sheath is misleading (1 star down). It came with a leather sheath with one side nylon, doesn't allow open carry(to be carried in the open pliers position), belt placement only vertical not horizontal, and lastly it cannot close whet the accessory bits are fitted (it can fit both but it doesn't close not even if only one of them is inserted).However the bit extended can fit on an elastic ""strap"" on the non-lather side of the pouch.Too much ""hype"" around this product and first impression was disappointing(1 star down).Don't get me wrong, i did my research and i got this product because i gauged it will serve my needs (also i lost my SOG B-62 and thought i would upgrade)Only one thing bothers me, all blades, tools pliers the whole multitool is a little stiff... doesn't open with the ease i would liked it to... but maybe it's just me.Overall a good product, but not perfect. Next upgrade Victorinox :)"
5,Leatherman Wave,This is an excellent product. I bought this for a Father's Day gift after I bought my husband one and he loves it. We use it all of the time.
1,Junk!,"The day after i got the Leatherman wave i examined and cleaned the parts after having lightly tested the saw blade on a piece of soft pine wood. When i opened it up and barely squeezed the pliers the metal strip beneath the joint broke away from the handle. Now the pliers are completely useless and i didn't even use them once on a job. Spend your money on a better tool, such as the SOG Powerlock. Leatherman tools are going down in quality."
2,Stainless ? I think not.,"I went to dicks the other day and put a magnet to every leatherman they had.Guess what, it stuck to every single one of them.A clue for the clueless, magnets do not stick to stainless steel."
1,Great if you love blood blisters!,Don't buy the Leatherman Wave...every time I use the pliers it pinches the base of my index figure...a real piece of crap with a poor design...off to put ice on my new blood blister!
1,Don't like it....,This tool does not feel good in your hand. I don't like it...It feels cheap.My friend bought the Gerber tool. We traded and both agreed the Gerber Freehand feels and looks better.
5,Awesome Product,I use this product just about everyday. Fits my hand very well. Case is a little on the cheap side but it holds the Leatherman very well. It has a little side pocket that i keep a small flashlight in.
5,"Gift for wife, got major brownie points","My wife occasionally needs some tools at work. Rather than wait for a work order to fix a loose screw in a cabinet or cut some wire to hang a marker board, she whips out the cheap give away multi tool I gave her that I got at a convention. After hearing how useful the cheap tool was, I bought her a real Leatherman Wave. She was REALLY happy with it. A real Leatherman multi tool is a better choice for the little jobs that come up."
4,Great for the Weekend,"I'm not a professional handyman, but I start every weekend by putting the Leatherman on my belt. I use it for everything from replacing batteries in children's toys, to slicing apples during a picknick. I am very impressed by the blade itslf, as it seems sharper and easier to maintain, and easier to open than any swiss army knife I've had. The screwdrives are helpful in a pinch but I would not rely on them for every task.. they are limited by size and their shape. The plyers are great for everything from holding small nails for hammering to pulling jammed CD's out of my car stereo. Other than the the mediocre screwdrivers, I think this a greeat tool for weekend warriors."
2,Bad sheath description and photo here.,"Again, the sheath in the picture is ALL leather, and ONLY comes with item# 830037, NOT this one!! This item#- 830039 - comes with a bulky, ugly, hybridized, nylon-and-leather sheath like the ""Leatherman (831102) Super Tool-300 Multitool with Premium Sheath""The tool itself is top-of-the-line, not the sheath though. Spoils such a great thing too. I was very disappointed because I would have made a different decision or at least I would have known what I was getting, now there is no time to switch - it's a gift for a friend.The item#830037 is sold here also, but no distinction is made between the two."
5,Utility.,"This is one of the most important pieces of gear I have ever bought. It's saved my life on countless occasions, and has helped me get out of less sticky jams. Everything from tightening your sunglass hinge to building a shelter. My advise if you're interested in purchasing, would be to buy the pocket clip. The sheath is nice, but the pocket clip is very convenient and only costs about $5.00. I'll give you a warning though... Once you've had it in your pocket for a week or so, your pants won't feel right without its weight, and once you've used it a couple of times you'll find a use for it daily. I recently bought two of these for my buddies. Rather than telling them your welcome when they said thank you, I had to be honest and tell them sorry... You'll understand what I mean the first time you leave it at home."
5,Leatherman Wave,"Great tool/knife to have on any! job or in any situation! Have two now just in case one is ever lost , Ect. . Very tough tool and accessories in the tool . I can not go anywhere with out it!!"
4,New Wave,"Just received my New Wave....had one before and this brings back memories of the one I used to have. My old version didn't have the drill bit to change out and I love this feature on the new one. The reason I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 star rating is because the sheath pictured isn't the same sheath that came with it. The sheath I received only has a little bit of nylon on the side and is mostly leather. I also bought the pocket clip with lanyard and really like this feature, however with the pocket clip attached it won't fit inside the sheath, because it adds a little extra length to the tool."
5,great tool,Great leatherman andf great price. bought for my father in law. who gets a new one every year. He loves it
5,Leatherman 830039 New Wave Multitool with Leather/Nylon Combination...,"Arrived in perfect condition, item as described and expected! Prompt arrival. It was given as a gift and the recipient was very happy."
5,excellent product,"i haVE HAD ONE OF THESE TOOLS FOR 20 YEARS OR SO AND STILL USE IT ALL THE TIME, SO I SENT ONE TO MY SON WHO IS A MOUNTAIN BIKER AND SNOWBOARDER , LOVES IT AND IS GREAT FOR QUICK REPAIRS IN THE FEILD."
3,GREAT STUFF BUT YOU HAVE TO SEND IT BACK FOR SERVICE,"This is a great tool very usefull as i always carry, but Tim Leatherman has gone too far with his latest stuff. As you might want to tight the tool once in a while but guess what? The tool uses their propietary screws a mix between a torx and some pin in the middle. So you have no other choice than sending it back to them just to tight it. Besides that is very usefull and the 25yr warranty is something to have."
1,Brandnew and broken after 1st usage,What a disappointment.I will update this comment with link to the pictures of the defects with this tool.What a lie.
4,Very good treatment,"I was in excellent treatment and very good communication with the seller, I recommend it and I want to keep it that way with me and other buyers. Thanks"
5,About the case...,"I recently purchased this product and thought the case wasn't too bad. Just to add, since there are already quite a few reviews, i placed the Brightest Mini Pocket Keychain Size CREE LED Flashlight Runs on 1 AAA Battery with on / off Switch and Lanyard in one of the side pockets. Its on amazon and is the brightest little flashlight i've ever seen. It fits in one of the side pockets perfectly. Its a nice little addition to this already awesome tool. I'm still trying to figure out what to put in the other side pocket. Overall I think this is going to be an excellent investment.**UpdateI placed a mini bic lighter in the middle pocket. So that gives you this awesome multitool with an amazing flashlight and fire all in one convenient place. Whats not to like there!"
4,Leatherman 830039,Bought the Leatherman for my husband and my father forFather's day. They both love it and say it comes in very handy.The only problem was with the case. I think my husband's casefell apart.
1,two thumbs down,after reading reviews i bought the leatherman wave. i own a gerber suspension and found the gerber far superior
5,Best Multi-toll out there.,"Thanks CrocoDeals for this awesome tool from Amazon! Thisthing can do anything. I owne the older style WAVE, but I wanted an extra to keep at home for my wife. It is extremely tough and well designed."
2,problems with screw driver can opener and mini screw driver,"Even though I have had excellent quality with my previous leatherman knifes, this one came with very loose can opener and detachable screw driver, so each time you open it, they hang open which makes the tool hard to manipulate. I tried to tighten a pair of glasses leg screw and the tip of little screw driver broke at minimum force.I am not happy with this knife, and went back to the old one I had."
5,Leatherman rules,I purchased a new Leatherman wave recently as mine was stolen.The new model is fantastic with updated locking mechanics and the screwdriver interchange is awesome.I must admit the scissors are the biggest drawcard highly recomended.
3,One Major Flaw,"My thumb shows a very large blood blister as a result of this product's great flaw: If the pliers slip off whatever you are holding with them, it is almost inevitable that you'll get pinched, painfully.Apart from that, this is a sturdy, well-designed and well-made tool that I use all the time. In fact, this is the second Wave that I've bought. The knife blade is as sharp as anything I've used recently--indeed, the user needs to be careful. The serrated blade is good for cutting rope and tough work--I actually cut some carpet patches with it. The screwdrivers seem to get almost all screws that I need to drive in awkward places. I use the file occasionally.The new leather/nylone sheath is a bit harder to close than the old all-nylon one was, because that one had a Velcro closer while this one has a snap. On the other hand, the Velcro degraded, so the new design shows signs of being better for the long haul."
5,Great Tool!,"This New Wave is a great tool! I really like the slightly longer knives and the interchangable driver bits. It has all the handy tools you'll ever need day-to-day or in a pinch. I even fixed a burst radiator hose with my old one! I'll never be without one of these little gems.To all you folks who had your orders cancelled, I strongly encourage you to put it behind you and simply reorder it - you won't regret it! Plus right now you get a free Micra with it!!!"
4,Great Multi-tool,"Great for light home repair(dorms/apartments), camping(car/campsite) , and awesome for fishing!I first intended on using this for backpacking/bushcraft...bad idea. While it's rugged, tough, and well manufactured; it's trail heavy and the open hinges let dirt work it's way into the mechanisms even after light trail use."
3,leatherman not the best,"I tried this one and the bigger version, of the two I liked the larger one better. I really did not like either due to feel and safety. With the tool out of the case and not in plier mode the knives can and have come out and can cut you. S.O.G. is the tool I now have two the smaller and p60. Bought the p60 on amazon and at a good price. love them. Safer and feels better in my hands.Leatherman is becoming the comet of multitools, but they need to make some more improvements."
2,Not as well-built as the old wave,"Based on my experience, this is a step backwards from the old Wave. My old wave was sturdily built, and I used it for years without problem, until it got confiscated at airport security. Doh! I recently replaced it with the New Wave. I used the small flat screwdriver head right out of the box, and the tip snapped off with only medium torque. Amazon replaced it, but on that one the every time I used the scissors the spring bar kept popping out to the side, making them unusable (I found someone else who had the same problem, and they posted a picture here: [...]. Amazon is replacing again and I hope third time's a charm. It's of course too small a sample size to draw definitive conclusions from, but it seems Leatherman's quality control is going downhill. The other tools seem to be fine. Perhaps the higher end models (Charge), which are made of better material, are sturdier."
5,Good product,"I have used this a few times since I bought it and it is very well made. It does not twist when you are using the bits or screw driver. Very solid. Some people complain about the sheath, but I specified the leather one and it is good too. No complaints. I would order this again and recommend others order it."
4,Nothing new,"I am replacing a Wave I have used daily for 5 years and it finally wore out. My only problem is how is this one ""NEW"" its the exact same tool I had before not that I am complaining I just expected it to be better. Oh there is one different the sheath is leather."
3,Pretty Good,Well explained and great use of simple maps to help explain the story. It seems the Author spends a lot of time defending Hannibal or making various excuses for him. So a lot of the book seems wasted on the various detailed defenses of Hannibal's record. The book makes me want someone to make a movie of this as it would be something to see a mass elephant charge in a movie!
3,Average,"While Dodge's book is informative it is not completely trustworthy. T.A. Dodge was clearly very enamored by Hannibal and thus ran into trouble because he seemed to have a hard time criticizing Hannibal in any way. When he did so it was insincere, nothing more than window dressing. In fact, on a few occasions he directly contradicts himself, whether purposefully or not I do not know, in order to portray Hannibal in a brighter light. Also, as other reviewers have stated, Dodge apparently had rather poor grammer skills which cause his writing quality to decrease some. The only reason I would rate this book as a 3 star instead of 2 is because, while the book has a relatively high amount of flaws for a history, most are either trivial or easily deciphered and do not affect the good amount of information and quality analysis."
1,"Read any other book of the 2nd Punic War, just not this one","This is the most subjective book there is on Hannibal, or the Second Punic War. Dodge ignores historical evidence, and injects his own beliefs and feelings. I used it as a reference for tactical analysis on the Battle of Zama, but was forced to dismiss and omit much of Dodge's material in favor of more reliable sources."
3,Thick with hero worship - but sill a fascinating read,"""From him they learned what strategy can accomplish against force, and this knowledge, improved by them, as they improved everything they touched, has descended, among their other great legacies, to civilized mankind.""According to Dodge the world learned strategy from Hannibal. He sure does make a convincing argument for it, but at a cost of not giving other generals of the Second Punic War their due credit. For some strange reason it was only Scipio that was blessed with good lieutenants.The most enjoyable part of this volume is the dissection of the wonderful march from Spain to Italy over the Alps, the rest of it very thick with hero worship and unsubstantiated guess-work. Still this is probably the most comprehensive book on the subject, so definitely a must read for anyone interested in ancient military history."
4,Excellent Resource For Practical Financial Risk Management,"This book emphasises the relationship between the debt and currency markets. This relationship can be summarized by the international fisher equation, however this book addresses topics that are typically not addressed in more theoretical texts. If you really want to understand how the international currency and debt markets operate on a practical level, including a rather comprehensive coverage of Swaps, Caps, Collars, FRAs, etc., then this book is a must. The mathematics in this book are rather simple and should pose no problem for a beginner or intermediate level student of finance."
5,A True MAN,"This gives the perfect example in which a family should function. In our current times, we have so many dysfunctional communities which is a reflection of so many dysfunctional families. Not often do we see an example how a family should function. This movie illustrates the power , the love, and the security a family has to offer. Examine your role and it's impact in your family."
2,Ocean Heaven,"When i received the DVD, it looked like not an original one. I don't know if it's a copy only. I don't think I want to buy anything like it in the future"
4,"The sound if this jazz is different, but worth listening to",The sound of this CD is different in many respect. It has 4 guys playing sax and that is something you will not get every day at a jazz CD. Go for it. Spike will not let anyone down.
5,Great shoes,The quality of the Bacco Bucci shoes is the best kept secret in USA. These shoes are excellent and very fashionable.
1,Don't buy,"I switched to a Zefal TX Switch Mini Pump. Lists for $20 and is regularly on sale for $10, same as the Bell. The Zefal and the Bell are day and night. The Zefal snaps securely to the valve (I could never get the Bell to lock on), is easier to pump, lighter, and has a simple slide switch to go from presta to schraeder.Bell should be ashamed to sell this product."
1,Pure garbage,This pump comes with a hose and needle for blowing up balls. But there's no way to attach it securely to the pump! The instructions are completely useless. Does not deserve the one star.
1,"Ok, if you're tire is already inflated","I got this because it was cheap, but since it doesn't work and I have to get another, I didn't really save any money. The lever on top that looks like the lever on other hand pumps actually does nothing. It's completely fake: nothing inside moves when you move it, and it certainly does not help grab on to the valve. It's just something you can play with while you're waiting for someone with a decent pump to come help you. I did just manage to get air into a fully inflated tire. With a flat tire, I couldn't keep a solid enough contact with the valve to get air in."
1,Scam product???,"Huge waste of time and money. Must be a scam. I tried everything to make this thing work. I think I could get it to seal correctly, but once it is sealed, there is no way for the pump to refill itself with air after the first ""strike""."
1,Terrible quality product,"I can't believe a company would put their name on such a terrible product. You can get this to fill-up tires, but not without an engineering degree. Even with said degree in your arsenal of tools, this product does not work as advertised. Don't waste your money on this junk."
2,"Exploring Horizons Rhythm of the Tides - Bay of Fundy Nova Scotia, Canada","I was disappointed in this video. Too much time is spent with the crew and it's aircraft and not enough time doing the actual filming. Also, fast fowarding some of the scenery diminishes its beauty. Much of the scenery is also redundant as it appears that the aircraft is going over the same areas more than once. On the positive side, there is a segment on Lobster fishermen that is very interesting and worth watching."
1,Don't waste your time,"This could possibly be the most asinine movie I have ever seen. Gratuitous violence, non-stop profanity and no script add up to a lot less than a big hit. Don't let the teasers fool you; you're wasting yuor money if you rent or buy this turkey."
1,Since when is this sort of violence funny?,Have we all gone crazy? Since when is a dismembered human being in a plastic bag funny? Is it funny if it's somebody we know? In real life it is an horriffic thing. So then why does it suddenly become amusing just because it's not real? How can we justifyably say that we are not desensitised to this kind of horror when in our leisure time we allow it to entertain us?
1,Sucked!,"This movie is the stupidest film out there it was short, poorly acted, and it wasn't even beleivable! Come on people we can't subject our selves to film that we get nothing out of. This film is a waste of money and time."
2,The Big Miss,"This hybrid of hip-hop Tarantino and Hong Kong action films is for the most part a pathetic exercise. Director Che Kirk-Wong has a decent knack for staging action sequences but can't overcome the script's lame comedy. Mark Wahlberg's performance is a definite high point because he manages to escape this film dignity intact. Low point is Elliott Gould(How the mighty have fallen. You're not in ""M*A*S*H*"" anymore, Elliott.) throwing up on Lou Diamond Phillips. Christina Applegate plays Wahlberg's Jewish American Princess fiancee(!). The casting agents couldn't find authentic ethnic types for the role? Oh well, their better off for it."
4,best american film by hong kong director,"Often when a hong kong director comes to the States to make hisAmerican goal, he fails. For example look at Tsui Harks Double team,witch is nothing more then a stupido action flick,knock of,or Ringo Lams maximum Risk, a wacky mix between ronin and red heat. I had seen Che-Kirk Wongs 'Crime Story' before. And when I heard of this man comming to the west I was affraid that he would make another semi-action flick starring our belgium mussled friend Jean-Claude. But no,I was wrong. The big hit was a super komedy-action. With a totaly diffrent cast that youwould expect in these cind op movies. Lou diamond Philips does a great job and da same for Markie-mark..! This film rules END"
3,Not award winning but fun nontheless,"I do not believe that this film was meant to be an award winner. For people who are looking for a believable and realistic film this is not for you. However, if you you just want to have fun with a film and enjoy some easy laughter, this is for you! The thought of a hit man with an insecurity problem is a gut busting change of pace to the genre and Lou is delightfully wicked and warped. This is not a family film and is definatly a testosterone festival. I have to say that I found it completly enjoyable!"
4,The Big Hit,Funny movie! The actors in this movie have great chemistry. Nice hd transfer to bluray. Two Thumbs up!
4,Don't Kidnap the Boss's Goddaughter,"If you enjoy gangsta action movies you are sure to enjoy this one with Mark Wahlberg and Lou Diamond Phillips. Good cast, decent story, and good music make it well worth at least a rental. I enjoyed it enough to want a copy of it. It reminded me of movies like ""8 Heads in a Duffel Bag"" and ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"". When a group of gangsters does an independent job it goes very wrong. Especially for Wahlberg that plays the guy who literally does all the work and is very good at his job. Unfortunately the stress of a fiance and a lover wanting fine homes, cars, and lots of money is causing him to have a stomach ulcer and he can't poor the Milanta down fast enough. I recommend it."
4,"Phoney, Funny, but Phat","I seen the movie a few years ago (when I was 13), and thought the movie was really good. I just bought it the other day on sale and to my supprise, it was even better than before. You don't get bored with it; it's funny, and the action is really good. Go out and buy it today."
3,Too much kidding around for a hitman movie,"For a movie involving life and death, the actors were fooling around too much. ie, the scene where the hostage was supposed to to read the ransom note, also drinking tea during a hit (at the begining of movie)."
5,One of my top 10 films,"Every person that has reviewed this movie so far is an idiot.This movie is the funniest thing I have ever seen. Plus it has Christina Applegate in it. And Sisko (Avery Brooks) from Deep Space Nine. What more could you want.Moments that I still laugh about years after first seeing it are;1. Lou Diamond Phillips when the phone rings. The use of slow motion is perfect.2. Avery Brooks laying down the law to Lou Diamond Phillips when suddenly his phone rings at the worst moment. ""Give Me That...""3. Elliott Gould's speech at the dinner table.I needed a gut transplant from laughing when this film was finished. A must see if you are still brave enough to smile in front of your feinds - unlike the idiot credit card shopping yuppies reviewing this film on here."
2,not very pleaed,"I was not pleased with the fact that the product was offered for sale and then not available to ship thank you for refunding the money however, perhaps in the future we can do service together."
1,little little boys posing with big guns & explosive devices,"Good looking menu, but a very disappointing film. Perhaps if I was 18 I might enjoy it better but the action sequences were soooo scripted and so obviously choreographed I had to laugh. Utterly ridiculous. Little plot, little character. Perhaps it should have won best picture."
4,Just too funny...,"I know, I know...it's really crude humor, but it is side-splitting, laugh-out-loud, hilariously, well-done. If you liked Grosse Pointe Blank (John Cusack, 1997) you will love this movie."
3,funny,This is a good parody of mob/hit films. Four hit men kidnap a college girl without their boss knowing about it. It reminds me a bit of The Whole Nine Yards but it is not as good. It is funny at times and the cast seem to enjoy themselves.
4,:0),"I think Mark Wahlberg can have that little tiny comedic side to him love the cast, the action, the plot and the movie will add to collection"
3,The Big Hit,It's an alright movie. You have good known actors playing in it and that's what makes a better movie.
2,Goes from good to laughably bad.,"I don't think this movie was ever meant to be taken seriously, or if it was, the director definitely missed that goal. It starts out as a good action/comedy, with some really funny moments, but as it gets closer to the end, what little plot there was completely unravels, and what was a good blend of comedy and action quickly becomes a cheesy waste of time. If you want to see this movie, perhaps based on the nice trailers you saw for it, I would suggest renting it instead of buying it."
4,One ultra-cool cheesy funny high-intensity action film,"I love this movie! Its definitely one of my favorites, and I have the tendency to watch it twice in a row! Mark Wahlberg is such a hot, sweet lil badboy and with that innocent soft voice and smile he always gives me the tingles. Love the action scenes and the sense of humor is so cheesy its just hilarious. The romantic scenes with Mark and his many girls keep me coming back for more and more. For the girls, there is a great locker room scene with the guys' naked butts---yummy!"
4,an cool action movie with a hot new Star!,"this movie is pretty cool! it's got action, comedy and a really cool up-and-coming star. mark walberg plays a nice guy who is caught up between to golddigging women and a stressful job as a hit-man. when the team of hit-men that mark walberg is in dicides to kidnapp their bosses daughter (played by ultra cute China Chow) everything goes crazy!!The movie itself is alright, the comedy and action make a good 50/50 mix, and the plot is easy to follow. the extras on thid disc enclude, a so-so commentary, some ok deleted seens, and some other extras. if you rent it and watch it and like it, you should buy it, but otherwise, wait for this one to go on sale."
5,Fun fun fun!,"I actually bought this, which I rarely do with anything outside of the horror genre. If you don't need your movie characters to be in believable situations, you'll love this. Mark Wahlberg does a fantastic job playing the codependent, whipped hitman who just really wants to be loved."
2,Reads like a lightweight magazine article,"I ordered this book at the same time as ""Engineering Your Start-Up : A Guide for the High-Tech Entrepreneur"" by Michael L. Baird and ""High Tech Start-Up: The Complete How-To Handbook for Creating Successful New High Tech Companies"" by John L. Nesheim.This book is the clear loser of the three. If you can ignore the silly typos (Ann Winblad's name is spelled at least two ways, as is Dell Computer)and strange page layout, you are still left with a book long on pages but short on real information. Lots of sizzle, not much steak."
4,tool for the job,"I had this for some time but did not get to use it because I was out of the country. I bought this because i love multi tasking tools, especially if they fit in your pocket. I have one in my car all the time and needed one for things I may need around the house. as a guy i love tools, but don't collect them. So I read the reviews and saw it had most of what I needed - a hammer would have been nice - so I ordered it.I can't say it is the best tool of my life but it does what it is supposed to. I did not put it into real heavy duty use yet, where I push it to the limit but it seems strong enough. It also comes in a nice little case which you have to force to close. I am sure as time goes on the case would loosen itself. overall it is a tool for the job and handy. It is not very heavy. I wish they made it a little easier to get to the smaller tools but you get what you pay for. I got exactly what I expected for the money I paid."
4,Awesome Multi-Tool,"I have had a couple of the Leatherman tools in my life. This one is GREAT.. It's only drawback is the crappy leather sheath that it come with! You have to fight the tool to get it all the way down in to allow the top to snap. That is a small drawback for this tool however! I use it all the time, and it's come in handy quite often! I really love the small scissors!"
5,Awesome tool,"This thing is great, if you're like me you research everything before you buy it.This thing is built tough as nails, Zytel is a chemical, heat, and abrasion resistant material and it's also used in the frames of the Smith & Wesson M&P; model handgun, as well as cars and other heavy abuse items, it's tough, can take a ton of abuse and I prefer it over steel due to the loss of weight while carrying gear.So far I've pried things open with it, cut cords, striped wires and abused the ""eh"" out of it.As far as price goes, you never want to bring anything with you that you'll regret losing in the long run, the price and strength of this thing is incredible, whatever your MOS, I would highly recommend this over a steel one, as added Zytel means it does not collect heat as a solid metal one would.Cheap, effective, strong physical integrity.My only complaint is that the blade is on the inside of the tool requireing it to be opened, but then again this is a tool, not a fighting knife."
4,Handy,First experience with this type of tool was an inexpensive knock-off. So happy with the new Leatherman Blast. I have tons of tools in garage and workshop but the Blast is the handy on the belt tool when you got to have it now situations. For my use - the Blast is great little item.
4,Among the many Leatherman models....,I have the original Leatherman from several years ago- still going strong. I wanted another one for my remote toolbox and this model seemed to be what I needed. I'm pleased- hefty enough. good selection of tools without complicating it or adding bulk or weight. And price-to-value ratio is good!
2,blast leather sheath,"Just recieved my leatherman blast As to the tool itself no problems, Seems to be a well thought out sturdy tool will have to wait to see how durable it is. Now to the bad the sheath. It is a a cheaply made leather sheath doesn't look like it would last long, Even if I could use it the covering flap is not long enough to snap closed by about 1/2 inch."
4,Incredibly Useful,This tool is worth every penny and has come in handy on more occasions than I can name.
4,"oops, broken gift","Great tool but here is my story.Early shopping for a gift, error.I never opened the tool, I wrapped it and gave it as a gift. Of course the return by date had expired and it turns out that this gift is broken.Red for Christmas, guess I'll open the sealed packaging next time."
5,Leatherman Blast,A very handy tool that my husband wears to work on his belt each day...we're very pleased with the quality and versatility. Highly recommend! Pricey but you are paying for great quality!
3,Leatherman blast,"The tool seems fine, but the cheap Chinese sheath doesn't fit. They said they are sending me a sheath that will fit. We shall see. Why can't they use American leather and labor for their sheaths, they charge enough?"
5,Ironic,This is really not a review of the product since it appears to have been well reviewed.But I just had to note the irony that a Leatherman offers no help in opening the deadly plastic clamshell packaging that the Leatherman comes in!I would really like see someone at Leatherman demonstrate this.
1,The locking mechanism is the problem.,This is my second Leatherman Blast and the second time that the locking mechanism broke on me. Buyer beware.
5,Swear by it,"I decided to get a Leatherman because my whole family swears by the name. I ordered mine to use both for the outdoors (since I camp a lot), and to put in my emergency kit; I got half the items on my emergency-kit list all in this multi-tool! Love it!"
1,Scissors broke on our first camping trip,Cool gadget but the scissor tab broke the 5th time I closed the knife.I can't use the scissors now since there's a jagged edge that would cut my thumb.
5,Exactly what it says it is,"Great knife! I had a PST II for years and absolutely loved it, it had everything I needed & nothing I didn't so it was perfect for me to carry all the time. When I was searching for a new knife, I again was looking for the smallest/thinnest leatherman I could find with the tools I do need & the fewest amount of unnecessary tools for my everyday needs. I don't believe in using a multi-tool for big jobs when I have a toolbox full of ""real"" tools in the garage waiting for me. I found the blast & it seemed to be the best fit for me from their current lineup. It is a great knife, I could do without a couple of the tools, but that's me. I am a less is more kind of guy. Everything works great & I will have this knife with me for years!"
4,Pretty sharp item,"This multitool is very good for all jobs large or small and as I said in my title ""very sharp""."
2,PLASTIC in this tool - keep away!,This tool is made up of roughly 33% plastic.I was surprised of the lack of quality in this Leatherman tool.Avoid this one at all costs.Are the people who left positive reviews for this item nuts?Since when was it acceptable for a multi-tool (even the $5.00 ones) to be made with plastic????
5,Outstanding quality and usefulness,"This thing will field dress an 800 lb elk or a 4 lb trout, snip wayward nose hairs, repair corroded battery terminals, grip a #16 treble hook, open a cold beer or a can of stew. I broke one of these years ago, and Leatherman immediately replaced it at no charge. This is the sort of thing you give to a 16 yr old boy wondering if he's a real man yet, or to a single mom who needs an all-around tool in the drawer. Money well spent."
5,Well made product,Only had for a short time but it has performed admirably as I have had it on my side during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy at the Jersey Shore. It's functionality and strength are a testament to its engineering.
1,it broke....,"This would have been a good product, except the locking mechanism broke during the first week of use..."
4,Reliable Product continues,"This is the third Leatherman product that I have owned and it is living up to the reputation and needs I expect out of this company. While some have talked about the leather case being too small, they are probably not familiar with the ""technique"" in which you have to slightly tilt the unit at an angle to get it to fit snugly into the case.The only fault that I have found is the unlock mechanism is a little tighter than need be, but overall it doesn't detract from my satisfaction of this product."
3,"Easy, enjoyable reading, but not Jane Austen","I found this book to be easy reading and it pretty much held my attention. If you are looking a for Jane Austen language, don't look here. Ms. Bebris uses 21st century language in her books. I found the plot to be easily guessed and ""who done it"" to be easily guessed. The interest in Ms. Bebris' books seems mostly to be an affection for Austen's characters, Elizabeth and ""Darcy"" (Fitzwilliam)."
1,"More of a love of self, vs a love of Peanuts collecting.","I was greatly disappointed in the book. While it has lots of Great pictures and information, the editor, freddy Margoline has to let us know time and again how big her collection is or how she has personally met Mr. Schulz and stuff like that. I just never got a ""Happiness is"" feeling from this book like I got from the Andrea Podley and Derrick Bang book. That book (Peanuts Collectibles: Identification & Value Guide) really does give the ""Happiness is a Peanuts Collection"" feeling in the spirit that Sparky would appreciate. So if you can only get one book on Peanuts Collecting, get the Podley one - it has a ""Happy"" soul."
2,Dixie Chicks sing William Billings,"Ever wanted to hear an album called ""The Dixie Chicks sing William Billings""? Well, this is it! A4 must have felt that the harmonies sound very like the DCs' (they do) or that the songs are southern stuff (they're not). For whatever reason they decided to do them with Country Western vocal mannerisms thrown in. I was crushed. I think they're affected, irritating, not what I expected from this group, and not the way anything on this album should be sung. You may feel differently. That's fine. The point is only that you be advised (warned) that very few cuts on this CD are sung ""straight"". The few that are are breathtaking. The rest, well.... And the diction! In the sweet bye and bye, for example, these ladies will meet on a byoo-dee-full shore. You may not, I repeat, mind, or even notice, but you should know that this is what to expect."
5,True American Sounds,"I have had this album for several years and recently bought another one for a friend. The Anonymous Four have voices that are as ethereal and transporting as any I have heard. The hymns and traditional songs are truly a compilation of our history, especially those of us who live in the south. It is music to listened be to intentionally, not as a backdrop. Focus on the harmonics and the crystal-clear lyrics and you will find, as I so often have, that you are transported to a spiritual space within yourself, and perhaps to a time and circumstances far different than those extant today. This is truly beautiful American music."
5,"One of those ""Best Kept Secrets""!!!",Although written in 1927 Erskine reads like 2005. This is the only book I've ever read that portrays a viable Adam discovering things for the first time.I've only read about half the book but I am so looking forward to finishing it that I had to write this review now. I will update later.
5,Still a great (re)read after many years,"A little old fashioned now, but still a great read and a very funny take on the relationships between Adam as ""man"" and women. All single women should read this. See if you identify with Lilith, or Eve."
5,great true story,"Gone in the night is a great movie that should be watched by parents. At the end of the movie, her real parents knew her Uncle did it even though there wasn't enough proof and he confessed to her murder."
2,"MAJOR dissapointment. For this pain, I need special ointment.","This is a piece of trash. The graphics and gameplay are horrible, and there are very stupid sound affects. Also, Wolverine is utterly disrespected and so are the villains Sabretooth, Lady Deathstrike, and Cyber(all of whom are cool)This game is junk. If you like X-Men stuff, stick to games like Wolverine's Revenge, and steer clear of this thing."
5,Awesome,Really great album mixing the best traits of the last two. It has the fun/funkyness of Ocean Avenue with the deeper and edgier sound of Lights And Sounds. Definitely a recomendation for anyone who's ever liked any of their songs.
3,"3-1/2 stars -- Decent, but they're trapped against a wall","Amidst all the punk-pop that was dominating the airwaves in the early `00s (and still is) was Yellowcard, who created a classic album inOcean Avenue. Their follow-upLights and Soundswas also good but it appeared that the band was slowly trying to stray away from the emo sound. But it looks like they're going back to that sound on Paper Walls.This is far from being a bad album, but the only song that really stands out is ""Shadows and Regrets"". The necessary acoustic songs ""Dear Bobbie"" and the title track are also good, though, as is ""Cut Me, Mick"" (the title obviously being a reference to the famous Rocky line, but the song not so much). The thing is, even though violinist Sean Mackin is still wholly present, Yellowcard somehow changed from a great band to ""just another"" emo band. Paper Walls is still a good album, but if you're not a big fan of Yellowcard, B.I.F.Anthony Rupert"
4,They are back,"After Ocean Avenue became one of the best albums I have ever heard, Yellowcard became one of my very favorite bands. I was stoked for Lights and Sounds"" but I must say I was quite disappointed. It's almost as if they tried too hard. Anyway they fell off the map with me after a while. Then I'm in the store and see Paper Walls and bought it not expecting a whole lot. I liked it instantly. The first few songs are great, driving pieces and the violin is back in a great way. Overall I'm just pleased that this talented band is back doing what they do best."
3,my review,hey well i think this album isnt incredible and im not goin to get into detail about the bad but i think its good i like how the yused a choral group for paper walls and i light up the sky some of the slower didnt need to be added but yellowcard is an easy band to like so i hope you all enjoy the album
4,classic yellowcard,"If you want to buy a CD that sounds like classic yellowcard, upbeat, high tempo, and fun lyrics, then this is a sure thing CD. the sound isnt terribly different from other yellowcard LPs so if you like their previous work, you will love this as well!"
3,Not overly amazing.,"Since I bought Paper Walls I think I've only listened to it once or twice because it wasn't as catchy as Yellowcard's previous albums. There are a few good songs but overall I'm just not impressed, although I still love the band and I'll buy their next release."
5,A fun board!,"Bought this for my 12 year old and he loves it. He was timid at first, going down the big hill, but got the hang of it. His siblings tried it and had a great time."
1,Could be better,"Although product is rated for 5 and over, I wouldn't recommend it for ages under 10. The bindings are difficult to release and the way they attach to the board allows them to stick out the bottom and act as snow brakes. If the rider had larger boots this may be less of a problem? Although other reviews made mention of the binding issues, they didn't seem to indicate they were that big of an issue."
4,The sound quality suffers on this live effort,This album was remastered for a better sound quality and released as Tremulous Antenna from HUX records in 2002. Live in the Air Age has the best sound quality of Be Bop's live work. This album displays cuts from Modern Music and Drastic Plastic that show this band could translate work from the studio to the stage. The live version of the Modern Music medley should put to rest those who would state that Bill Nelson could only shine when doing studio overdubs. The cuts Dangerous Stranger and Panic in the World will leave a smile on your face.
3,A good holiday read,"I bought this partly (I think) because it was supposed to be an autobiographical novel, and partly because it was about difficult mother-daughter relationships (on which it excelled). I took it along on a trip through the South, and it was good reading -- partly because of the setting, partly because of the suspense created because the novel starts with the original romance and then drops it and doesn't come back to it until later, so you wonder what has happened and why people seem to have changed.... I thought the story got a little implausible toward the end, but I was still compelled to sit up past when I should have gone to sleep, to see how things came out. As a romance it's probably a four-star book."
2,"A generic, mildly moving piece of work","I have not read the original version of this work, but the translation lacks originality and art. A beautiful story, but the writing style lacks grace and creativity. This is the only time I have liked a movie better than the book. Do yourself a favor and skip the book. The movie is quite beautiful and moving."
4,Quality Satilite Speakers for the money.,"These speakers are a cost-effective solution for remote sound in a Family Room or Home Office. The sound is better than expected for the low cost. Plenty of power to be used without additional speakers. Wall mounting is tricky (non-adjustable bracket), but achievable."
4,Good song but boring,Good song but some of 'em is boring and use some old folk song but its still good to hear those song. Marie is good song but this song is to simple. Thats all
2,"""Why can't everyone leave me alone?""","""Asylum"" is well-written but somewhat unmemorable. Oxford in 1278 is intelligently depicted, but the plot has only enough substance for a traditional four-part ""Doctor Who"" story or a Telos Novella. There's not enough plot and characterization here to sustain a full-length ""Who"" novel; instead, we get scenes that repeat what we already know.Nyssa, one of the most likeable ""Doctor Who"" companions, is especially poorly served by this book. She spends the whole story within the grounds of Oxford Castle, hiding from the outside world, making no contribution to the plot and sinking ever deeper into a depression that seems born of a desire on the author's part to present his own personal problems to the world rather than tell an interesting or entertaining ""Doctor Who"" story.Even the Fourth Doctor is weakly characterized in this book. Unless you want to read every ""Doctor Who"" book ever published, I suggest you skip ""Asylum""."
1,Very disappointing,"Quick review: boring and tedious. 4Doc is barely adequate, but pairing him up with Nyssa before he meets her in the TV series is completely wrong. As a plot point it adds very little to the story, and worse off she comes off completely different from what I'd imagine her to be that many years later. Darvill-Evans would probably have been better off using a completely new character rather than bringing back an old. As for the murder mystery central to tbe plot, lets just say I saw through it almost as soon as it was introduced. The real purpose of the book, it seems, is for the author to display how much he knows about medieval society and thought. But mere knowledge do not a plot make."
3,I thought the book was just O.K....,"Well, although this book was better then the first one in the series (Behaving Herself) it was still pretty slow.Why this book wasn't the first in the series I don't have a clue but anyway at the beginning of this book you are introduced to Mariah Garrison who is a cattle rancher's daughter & Stuart MacCallum who is a sheep farmer. Mariah & Stuart have secretly been seeing each other under everyone's noses & they decide that the time has come to announce their engagement to their families. Neither family takes the news very well since sheep & cattle don't mix. Mariah & Stuart decide to ignore what anybody else thinks because they are truly in love & they eventually marry. Other then some conflict between the sheep farmers & cattle ranchers there's not a whole lot more to this book.I had really high hopes for this series but so far I'm pretty disappointed. I'm sorry to say that so far I can't recommend this series."
3,Koop - Sons Of Koop,"Koop's first album SONS OF KOOP skirts between ambient and trip-hop, with a definite Scandanavian chill. While the occasional flashes of brilliance appear (like ""Glomd""), this is very much Koop discovering their direction, experimenting with industrial (""Psalm"" and ""Bijarne Riis"") to frigid trip-hop (""Absolute Space""). ""Words of Traniquility"" sounds like it's beaming straight from a lonely cantina on the moon, with ethereal vocals and the occasional chords from a accordion. All the songs are extremely quiet and subtle, sometimes too subtle, I think, because despite their quality, they slip by (like the vocal track, ""Salvation""). ""Jellyfishes"" has a kick drum that gives it a bit more life, while ""Once Britten"" (a reference to the modern composer) throws into a heavy drum pattern halfway through the dream. Though not entirely unsuccessful, it still has the hallmarks of enormous talent that's looking for its voice."
3,How peculiar!,"Buy at your own peril! This one is seriously odd, but somehow strangely very catchy, you'll find yourself singing weirdest phrases 'cos no-one I know understands a word they say. Slippery beats and Bjork-ish vocals all add up to a psychedelic funk-fest."
2,Downtempo Dustbin,"I bet Koop doesn't even listen to this record. It's that bad.The album started promising, with the moody ""Glomd""; I really liked the song's subtle harp touches and what felt like a house beat just waiting to come out and take over. Thankfully, that didn't happen, and the song remains understated and beautiful. The album pretty much took a nose dive after that, into unoriginal pseudo-Bjork territory (the next song, ""Psalm,"" featuring someone named K. was pretty much a blatant rip-off of Post-era Bjork).The album production is mildly enjoyable -- almost sufficient (I particularly liked the accordion samples throughout) -- but ultimately it's a good thing this album is out of print. On this record, Koop has not yet become the fully-formed group that produced the great ""Waltz for Koop,"" which is good from beginning to end. ""Sons of Koop"" is the sad, depressed teenage offspring of ""Waltz for Koop."" And even the band is likely to be eager to forget their formative years."
1,SUPCO VG60,"I had one of these cheapo Supco VG60 micron gauges several years ago and it was a piece of crap even back then. I owned it for less than a year and it had always been taken good care of. It had never been exposed to overpressure or oil contamination.One day while using it to check the vacuum on a brand new recovery cylinder I was evacuating, it started giving me inaccurate and erratic readings then wouldn't indicate anything below atmosphere [ATM] on the scale. I tried changing the battery, cleaning the sensor with alcohol and adjusting the calibration screw, but was never able to get it to work properly again. Since then, I have never bought another Supco electronic test instrument. I still use their relays, capacitors and other such products though."
3,thought it was great until...,"I was really happy with this light when I first bought it. It was fairly easy to figure out and not so complicated. It seemed to work well. Easy to install on my bike and seemed like a good idea because you could take off the light and store it in your pocket while you stored your bike. But...the light got stuck and wouldn't come off, so I had to leave it on the bike. A few days after buying the light, it suddenly fell off the bike while I was riding and broke into several pieces. It seems like if I ducktape it, I might be able to get it to work somewhat. I guess you really have to spend more money on bike lights to get a good product. They need to make permanent lights that people won't want to steal and that are reliable."
2,Great idea...if it only worked!,"I was thrilled to find that a reasonably priced rechargeable bike light exists. I avoid throw away battery items like some avoid taxes. We have too much toxic stuff in our landfills already an I refuse to add to the this insanity. However, to my great disappointment, the internal workings of the light seem to burn out before ever recharging properly and before the the green light goes on to indicate a full charge. Then the light ceases to function at all. Amazon was great in sending a replacement TWO times, yet the same problem persisted. I checked with BELL too to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong and I wasn't. This light is a great idea, albeit with some definate glitches that need to be worked out by Bell. The two stars are for the great idea."
5,Dedicated to it's job.,Although this tool is some what limited in use it performs excellent for the purpose it was designed for. I have used this tool to drill and tap many holes in machine bases and bolster plates that were too large or could not be moved to a drill press. With a good lay out job and heavy center punch you can accurately place the Mag Drill on center each time. The base of the tool is also a de-magnetizer for easy removal of chips and clean up.
4,"Beautiful pattern, but hard to find","We recently bought three sets of these, plus some accessories. We love the pattern, it is simple yet pretty, and the neutral colors match most decor well. The accessories are also very nice, as they are stoneware, rather than corelle glass. I do wish the bowls were a little deeper for cereal or ice cream. Also, some of the accessories listed at corelle.com are not yet available anywhere, though I would expect to see them for sale soon."
3,ice cooler,Great product. It would be better if the white item is transparent to facilitate the transparencies position.
3,Bottle Chiller,When I received this product one of the plastic prongs in the middle was broken. I glued it back on and it is working fine. We used the mold over Christmas and put pine needles and red berries in it and it looked very beautiful.
3,Proud Wolf's stock drops a few points,"After we've already had an earlier volume in this trilogy (plus an entire earlier trilogy) to know and respect Clay Holt's Sioux brother-in-law, he appears to crash and burn here. A Native American reader would have to have a lot of tolerance to be able to stomach the way the previous volume had a well-meaning anthropology professor who just plain doesn't get it sending Proud Wolf back east to school. Here, the school headmaster's teenage daughter becomes infatuated with the guy. One can only speculate where her head is at. Does Proud Wolf represent sort of a rebellion against Daddy? Or does she find him more manly in comparison to the effete ""I say, fella"" types she's used to? I can't see much respect involved in either scenario. I'm going to grab the next one because the other story lines in this trilogy make it worth it. But I definitely want to see if Ross gives Proud Wolf's dignity back to him."
5,Vengeance,Having read them all I like this one and also Honor had a hard time finding Honor but all three of these are worth the time looking and reading
3,Vengeance!,This is the second in the Empire Trilogy....This one wasn't as good as Honor! I thought this one jumped around too much.I also didn't like the ending with Jeff and Melissa splitting.
4,"This batch was undercooked, but good crackers typically.","I use these crackers in place of Ritz and Premium crackers which contain high fructose corn syrup in them. This particular batch was simply way undercooked so they were pale and crumbly. I'm waiting for the company to get back to me regarding a refund, and unfortunately it's taking quite a while."
5,Best Cracker On The Market... Hand Down!,"Cabaret's are probably the most delicious cracker that I have ever sinked my teeth into. Cabaret's can be enjoyed as a delicious hors d' oeuvres or a succulent meal. This is probably the most romantic cracker hands down, as I often eat this with my beautiful girlfriend..."
3,Not worth the $$$$$,"This is a VERY expensive shop-vac. I purchased this for household use....cleaning sand from the cars, vacuuming the mud room and taking care of sawdust in and around my home when I do projects. The hose is a standard size and it comes with no attachments (which is clearly outlined in the description). While I have not had to use it as a wet vac as of yet, I am not impressed with the suction. It is, at best, slightly better than my home cyclone style vaccuum."
1,"rust easily, hard to get tarts out","Making these tarts is hard work because you have to cut, shape and place the dough in each individually. Then when they dont slide out its very upsetting.The coating comes off easily and more of mine have gotten rusty so Im using them as festive wax candles.Try the tartlet pan from Williams Sonoma that comes with a punch and placer. Its not perfect but its far superior."
3,Not like the others,"I love MLvF, I own I think 6 of her books and plan to keep buying. I just want to let people know though that this isn't the usual pleasurable walk through fairy tales with her experience and insight. It's more theoretical and abstract, less personal. It's a bit interesting, looking at old myths and philosophies but, eg I never got any personal insight that there is in almost any other of her works. It's metaphysical writing that could be by any number of people."
5,Has the tools I need.,"I received my Fuse as a Father's Day present. I had done some research on the various models in the Leatherman lineup, and this one had the features I wanted (locking tools and number of tools) for the price I found reasonable.I had read that the tools on the Fuse were hard to open, but have found that each tool has been very easy to open and use. I'm not sure if the reviewers had a Fuse that was too tight, but mine has performed exactly as I was expecting. A co-worker has a Wave and was impressed with the sharpness of my Fuse's blade compared to his.I use mine occasionally at work (Design Engineer), at home (household projects), and carry it with my when I'm out biking or hiking."
5,Great Multi-Tool,I bought this for my son and he just loves it. He uses it every day and finds it very helpful. He said the scissors are really sharp too.
4,Good quality,"I've tried these multi-tools before and have never been all that impressed with them. They seem a little awkward and with the exception of the pliers there is nothing on this tool that a good old fashion Swiss Army Knife can't do and do it better. I'm going to stick with Genuine Swiss Army knifes still. They are smaller, lighter, easier to open, easier to work with, and usually less expensive. Don't see why anyone prefers a Leatherman over a Swiss Army Knife unless you must have a pliers. A pliers is handy but I would not give up the small size and ease of use of a Swiss Army Knife. This tool is built solid though. It does have a locking mechanism for the blade which Swiss Army knifes don't have which is a small plus. Overall, not a bad tool. I'll probably leave it in my glove box. I'm sure a need will arise for it at some point. Camping though I will definitely stick with my Swiss Army Knife."
4,Leatherman Fuse,"My wife gave me this for Christmas, and I absolutely love it. I carry it everyday in my back pocket next to my wallet(didn't care for the sheath, hope to get a Maxpedition Single Sheath for it). It's a tool kit in your pocket, which is great since I also carry my grandfather's 40 year old Imperial Scout Knife (with deer stag handle and carved image of deer) and it doesn't have pliers, wire cutters, screw drivers, scissors, etc. I hope to upgrade to a Surge one of these days, but this is perfect"
5,nice price point,"fits well in your hand, has all your basics. just be aware that it doesn't come with interchangeable bits or a corkscrew. the knife comes nice and sharp from the factory, the sheath seems sturdy, but haven't used on my belt yet. it won't break your bank and it's well built! thumbs up!"
3,Spend the money and get a Wave,"The Fuse a decent multitool, but there's too much friction opening the blades, tools, and pliers. Over time, it might loosen up, but out of the box it's awkward to use.The Wave has better build quality and is easier to work. We purchased the Fuse as a gift for 10-year-old beginning fisherman and had to exchange it for a Wave so he could safely open and close the blades."
3,Tool OK. Sheath is trash.,"The TSA confiscated my classic Leatherman that I had for more than 20 years. I bought this as a replacement. The tool has some nice features, described in other reviews but it's larger and heavier than the one I had. The leather sheath that came with it was too small. I couldn't get the cover over the tool so the snap would close. It was at least 3/8"" too short. I ended up throwing the sheath away. Overall, I am disappointed. I wish they still made the original."
2,leatherman multi tool,to thick.. much larger than the old style.. harder to access some of the tools..
4,Uncommon cures etc. from Amazon.com,This a really worthwhile addition to your home medicine cabinet or library. As I am interested in wholistic medicine rather than an instant chemical fix I have found that the suggestions in this book relate to advice from my trusted Naturopath ( and of course Mercola and Phillip Day and Jonathan Wright )- you can look things up with confidence and I think anyone who likes to find out things for themselves would find it a trustworthy and reasonably priced buy. I got mine from Amazon for about $14 Australian and it arrived quicker than promised and in very good condition. Go for it.
1,Uncommon Cures for Everyday Ailments From Bottom Line,"For Uncommon Cures for Everyday Ailments:Just to remove this book from the mailing envelope makes my skin crawl...there are smears of various colors on it. Makes me feel like I should get on an antibiotic just from taking it out of the mailing envelope. The cover, other than the disgusting smears, is creased, wrinkled, bent and obviously care was not taken with it. From a quick look inside, the pages appear to be legible. There is however a dark smear across the outside edges of the first 56 pages. This one is going to stay in the mailing envelope until my husband sprays it down with Lysol.The other two books are Very Nice and in Excellent Condition!"
4,Good GPS,"This is a very neat unit. The color display makes all the difference compared to an earlier version I have used - the Magellan MAP 330. Although it has fewer screen displays than the 330, all the necessary information is available including vertical profile (with the Mapsend Topo software) and it is much more readable. The GoTo pointer is constantly updated on the move as you approach a destination (although I would like to see a thicker line for this function). I am very pleased with the unit and in fact bought a second one for my son."
1,It would be zero stars if I could,"The unit worked great in the US, we moved to Europe, I bought MapSend Direct route Europe, in the UK... The software didn't work, their customer service is non exsistant! I am proceeding with action in court, having wasted countless hours in emails, phone calls and letters, not including money spent pursuing them...AVOID AVOID AVOID, ( I recently bought a Garmin Nuvi.... aahhhh!)All the good reviews are meaningless, as they obviously haven't attempted dealing with customer service!"
1,Magellan customer service NIGHTMARE !!,"Amazon was great about refunding my money from these 'TWO"" defective units.Customer service understands very little English from India. The units burned up with the defective Magellan DC power adapter. No one at Magellan could explain or give any tech support on the power output of the DC adapter due to their language "" PROBLEMS "" via email or over the phone after four calls and at least six emails. I will never buy any product from Magellan again !!"
1,"Unreliable; customer ""service"" a joke","Unreliable pile of 'you-know-what'. Worked fine for about 2 months then refused to power up. Fresh batteries, no go. Called customer ""service"". Outsourced call center to India; rep followed generic script telling me to: 1) use lithium-ion batteries, and 2) press ""power + NAV"" simultaneously. As suspected, bogus advice. Fresh batteries metered out to 1.62 volts each / 4.84 volts total. Yes, I tried lithium-ion batteries anyway. Still no-go. Am still waiting for Magellan/Thales to respond. Am still owner of unreliable GPS. Still have about $400 invested in unit plus software and maps. Still kicking myself for buying a Magellan product. Don't do it. Really -- don't do it."
3,Magellan support doesn't exist,"I purchased a new Explorist 500 in August 2006. It works fine although doesn't seem to lock onto satellites as quickly as Garmin GPS. I have on occasion tried to get through to their support both in email and on the phone and I don't think Magellan support exists. When I had to buy a new home computer and it came with Windows Vista, I received a canned reply from Magellan that said basically I was out of luck that there is no way the Explorist 500 will talk to Windows Vista. I will not buy another Magellan product due to the lack of support and the fact they seem to be way behind in technology. Windows Vista has been around for almost two years. Plenty of time for someone to develope a patch."
1,Explorist 500 - garbage,"I just bought this worthless piece of junk through Amazon. However it doesn't start up properly, won't even compute my starting point and is, frankly useless. The only thing more useless is Magellan's customer service - no reply despite several emails. Trust my life to this piece of junk if I'm ever lost in the wilderness? No way. It can't even get me to my property line."
1,Not always a bargin,It worked for a few days and then stopped. I think the connector is too loose. The same port worked with the 800-400 cable but this 800-800 does not connect to my removable drive anymore.
3,Interesting material,"I found the part about George Washington's false teeth, as well as how he wanted his portraits to be painted very interesting. Even before photoshop the big wigs were dictating to painters how they wanted their features to be painted."
3,Not What I expected,I was expecting a much lighter weight set of dishes. This set is extremely heavy and cumberson.
2,Not engaging for toddlers,"My son is 2.5 years old, so I'm basing my review on what is appropriate for him.The book doesn't engage him. Normally, he consumes a new book straight away. But with this one, we read a couple of pages and he was on to the next book. The pictures are really dated as well.This would be better for an older child, because it goes into such detail like the belly button cord falling off and actually naming the uterus as the place where the baby grows.The other thing I dislike about this book is that the cover is flimsy. It is a thin paperback book. Another reason why it would be good for an older child."
2,Kids not that interested,"I bought a few books for becoming a new sibling. This one just doesn't hold their attention, and like the other books they never request this one or look through it. Not bad, just not good."
5,Fantastic book,"This book has been requested every single night by our 2 yr old since it arrived. He loves the pictures and the depth of detail. We love that it covers a range of topics related to a new baby, from pregnancy to hospital to mixed emotions about having a new sibling. After reading and discussing the book, our son has been able to articulate that I'm pregnant and what he looks forward to doing with the new baby--even proudly telling total strangers! This said, the book is text-heavy so not recommended for children who aren't into reading or who are younger and perhaps not very verbal. We do make some minor amendments while reading this book to adjust to his level of comprehension."
4,Daughter really liked the pictures,"We bought this book for our 3.5 year old daughter and she really liked it, especially because it had pictures of different babies, it helped her ""see"" what her sister would look like."
3,Just OK,"Shipping took longer than I expected and the book was in a lot worse condition than what I thought I was getting. Otherwise book is ok, you can tell its definitely dated (1985), but things haven't changed so much in the last 20 years of what happens when a new baby comes home. I like that it talks about and shows some of the specific things you have to do with a new baby, to be able to show and explain them to my 4-year-old before #2 arrives, like the belly button/umbilical cord and breast feeding, that babies cry alot, and how to be gentle with a baby."
2,Ok book not great for a younger child,I had a hard time finding a book to read to my daugher about her sibling on the way and finally decided to give this book a try. It is kinda outdated and has alot of words. It would be better for an older child but most of it went over the head of my 2 1/2 yr old. She likes looking at the pictures but there is not really a story to follow. If you need a book that talks about feelings and the logistics of what happens when a new baby joins your family then this book would be great. For us we just needed a book that talked about what being a big sister was and showed pictures of kids and their baby siblings
2,Warning: This may not be what you think it is.,"These recording were NOT made in the 50's; according to AMG they are re-recordings of his best known music and it was recorded in the 70's. For me, that spoils the fun."
1,Not my cup of tea...,"I was not impressed with the contents of this book. The otherviewers found the recipes to be favorable, but looking throughthe recipes, I personally did not find them appealing."
4,A lovely little book,"I bought this book years ago and still page through it for recipes. This is a sweet little recipe book with wonderful photos throughout. I have tried several of the recipes with much success. It is a small book, though, so do not expect history, serving hints or calorie counts. The scones and strawberry jam recipes are terrific. Now that I have changed my diet to totally vegetarian, I have revised a couple of the scone recipes to fit my needs and still have success."
2,Too Prissy,I love a good strong cup of tea...not to mention a buttery scone. The recipes in this book are too fancy and time consuming for me ...and most of the ingredients are difficult to find. Must be nice if you live in a universe where you can actually find the time to throw tea parties such as these. I wish I hadn't purchased...but live and learn.
2,not impressed,"This is the third book that I have purchased this week regarding teas, tea sandwiches and the like....I must say that it will be a very long time before I purchase books from Amazon again. I use this service because I thought it to be convenient, however with all the awful books I have been receiving, I think it would be a wise choice for me to simply go to a bookstore to physically view the contents prior to purchasing them. It has become a complete waste of my time and money to purchase these books even though I am trying to get a glimpse of the index and content online....The last (3) books that I just purchased with regard to teas parties, recipes and the like have all been extremely dissapointing. My opinion....they would make good gifts to children of 5yrs and younger....I was not impressed!!!!!!!!"
5,"Great book, fast service",Couldn't have asked for a better transaction during the holiday rush! My son loves the book and will keep it for years to come!
3,Four-Wheeler's Bible review,"I have no experience off-roading at all. I am in search of a decent off-road vehicle to access my new cottage that is in the bush. I bought this book to learn about off-roading and what to look for in a vehicle.I does not talk about specific vehicles at all, the author tries hard to avoid that. It does mention all vehicles a bit, but never says which is better or anything like that. If at all, it's a little US biased towards US built vehicles.It does however give good overviews of many different things like differentials, tires, wheelbases, vehicle lengths, gear you should have, lifting, etc. All in a general way.It's a good book and I feel it was worth the money. Good luck!"
4,Good book for first timers!,I didnt want to start off my first 4 wheel adventure not knowing what I needed or what to expect. this book help with both of those. Good book.
4,all the path u need 4 step I + more.,"excellent tables, charts, graphs, just like the last written step I; a comprehensive source with good organization; as well, it is easy to read, understand, and remember. only problem: no pagination; u have to manually number your own pages and similarly enumerate the indices."
2,"Get the older version, don't waste your money (or your time)","This book is a waste and is no longer a ""rapid review"" book. The book is over 600 pages and full of run on sentences and mistakes. The book was never edited and golgan should be embarrassed."
2,Too much hype,"I found this book absolutely useless for the purpose of USMLE. Old, outdated and crammed with never tested facts. This is a textbook after all. BRS Pathology is the best book for quick comprehensive review. Don't worth money nor time."
2,Rust in seconds.,"Maybe its my acidic and greasy fingers, but after 1 week, the B and E strings were completely brown and crusty. I keep my guitar in a nice hard case when its not in use. They sounded good, for the week that they functioned."
1,Cannot review - E String Broke!,"I'm gonna have to give this a One-star, because the 1st (E) string broke when I put it on and was tuning up the guitar. I have played the guitar for 10 years and hence can say that I was tuning the guitar to the right pitch. The string broke at ""bead-end"", close to the bead. I'm probably not buying these strings again."
1,"Review based on delivery and service of Shoreline, not product itself","Just a fair warning, if you purchase from Shoreline beware! My strings arrived contained in their Martin box and within a sealed envelope. When I opened the envelope and removed the box, it was already open.The box was open and there were three of the six strings missing from the box.I have ordered strings from Amazon before but never again. I strongly urge any musician out there who thinks it is worth saving ten cents to buy online to just go to a guitar or music shop. To get a package like this only to see that someone clearly stole merchandise from it, and ultimately from me is simply maddening.Martin Acoustic Guitar Strings are the best around, just don't expect much when ordering from the third party mercena-I mean merchants that Amazon has floating around here."
1,Brand New Strings - 6th E was a DUD!,Very dissappointed with these strings and will never buy them again. Went to rehearsal last night and found the 6th E string was a dud. Have never in all my years playing had new strings have problems but I did with these.
5,Great sound,"I use these on a 1947 martin 00018 and these sound amazing. they don't last as long as some of those coated strings, but the price is better and the sound is beyond worth changing the strings a little more often."
4,Good strings but not my first choice,"I tried these string out because Amazon had a $2 MP3 promotional credit, they were cheap, and my usual choice of strings(D'Addario phosphor bronze) were out of stock. To me, the Martin strings don't sound as warm as the D'Addarios, especially in the lower strings (6-4). These strings also don't have the color-coded ball ends to help size the strings....if you don't have much experience changing strings, this maybe an issue if you get in a hurry and mix the strings up. For the price, I'd order them again if the D'Addarios were not available."
3,Tone doesn't last long,"Since I got my Guild guitar 30 years ago I used to buy only Guild strings. But I can't find them anywhere. I've tried others, including these Martin strings, but have never been as happy as with the Guild strings. The tone, which is ""OK"" when they're new, doesn't last long. I don't pay that much attention to how long I go between new sets but these are the second or third set of Martins I've tried and they always seem to lose their tone quality early."
5,worked great,"It was my first guitar string purchase. It still works. My first strings, two broke off after week 1. Sorry if my english bad."
5,Best sound for Taylor 414,"I've been using these strings for several years. Taylor comes with the Elixir strings installed. I found that these Martins have a much better sound but do not last as long. However, though the Elixirs produced a consistent sound for months and months, the sound was not as interesting or colorful as the Martins. I have never amplified the Elixirs on the Taylor 414--it may be great. I did run the Martins amplified on the 414 and they were marvelous."
4,"informative but, missing some stuff","this book showed me places i forgot and never knew about.yet, it was missing:The Swiss Chalet, Colonial Inn, The Country Cottage, Washington Furnaces, Cottages and some more.still, worth having."
2,CHINESE JUNK!!!!!,"Its made in china, you will go through belts as quick as you can change them, I would recommend Metabo over milwaukee any day"
3,nose pieces,The nose pieces are fine but do not last very long on the nose piece.....best thing to do is clean the surface with alcohol and dry good then they will last longer
5,GREAT NOSE PADS,THESE ARE FOR MY SUNGLASSES. THEY ARE COLORED BROWN LIKE MY SUNGLASSES AND ARE VERY COMFORTABLE. THESE DO NOT LEAVE DENTS ON THE BRIDGE OF YOUR NOSE AFTER WEARING GLASSES. ONE PAIR LASTS FOR MONTHS. I HAVE ALL MY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES ALWAYS ASKING ME TO PUT THEM ON THEIRS. I WILL HAVE TO DIRECT THEM TO THIS SITE TO GET THEIR OWN (HEHEHE)
5,Safety Glass Nose Comfort Pads,"For years I used to wear light weight frames and plastice lens. Then I was precribed safety frame and safety lens. My nose needed help. My nose did become red, tender, and evently the skin did broke down. Until the order arrived I made up different types of padding for my nose. Very much I appreciate this product."
2,This illustration is misleading,"Pads look completely different than what were shown in the description. Instead of being clear, they are very noticeable skin-tone color. They do what they are supposed to do, but I wouldn't recommend them if you chose these for their looks."
4,The Four O'Clock Murders,The Four O'Clock murders is a indepth look at the tradgedy of the LeBaron family. I found the book very interesting to the point I could not put it down. It looks very closly at how once decent beliefs can be twisted to suit ones greeds. This book follows through generations of this family giving some insight into what made this family tick. I would recomend this book.
5,All I can say is WOW!,"I am so glad that I decided to read this book. I can't blieve that there are people who use religion to justify criminal behavior. I stumbled on this family by accident, after reading ""Favorite Wife"" by one of Verlan LeBarons' ten wives. After that, I read another book by his 2nd wife as well. Both wives mentioned their brother-in-law, Ervil Lebaron and how he killed his brother. Both books were very interesting but they were just the tip of the iceberg. I was interested in the polygamy aspect, but I never expected to learn as much as I learned from reading this book. The LeBaron family is so SCARY that I can't believe that I never heard of them until now. I have to warn you, some of the incidents are very disturbing to read. I still can't believe that this is a true story."
3,Missing Pages in All Copies?,"After receiving the book yesterday, I flipped through the pages and immediately noticed pages 177-192 are missing! Is every copy like this?"
3,Nicholas meets Maggie,"After befriending Adam, Professor Stokes learns of the man-made creature's strange hatred of Barnabas Collins. Angelique summons the ghost of Sam Evans to spread her devious dream curse to Victoria Winters.Warlock Nicholas Blair meets Maggie Evans and becomes attracted to her. Maggie's boyfriend, Joe Haskell, is hospitalized after a near-fatal encounter with Adam."
5,dsd remaster,"I have owned a previous incarnation of this disc for over 10 years and loved it.BUT this dsd remaster is remarkable, a disc tom truly treasure."
2,I'm not middle age yet.,"When I read the title of the book, I was under the impression that it would be much more well rounded and could be applied to all aspects of womanhood."
4,helpful in times of transition,"I've now turned to this book twice, after reading it over a year ago, I've picked it up once more. I find it comforting to remember that sometimes it is best to be still long enough to decide if your discomfort is really what you think it is all about, or perhaps you are running, fretting, dreading, regretting... the wrong things entirely -- or you are unclear about why you are running, fretting, dreading, regretting... anyway, it is a helpful book if you are needing some reassurance that your discomforts are normal, universal, survivable, and even beneficial!"
1,Not a Fan,"I appreciate all of the heartfelt reviews for this book, however I have found this to be a completely shallow book. The prose is sappy, predictable and tiresome, in my opinion. The work might have been better if edited and written as an article. I cannot fathom how this book reached anyone, but obviously it has. If you are seeking something to comfort, make you think (and think deeply)...I suggest you look elsewhere."
5,finding your Inner Space,"An earlier writing, ..a personal journey of Sue Monk Kidd, author of The Secret Life of Bees, is purely and simply put,.. a Jewel. A book not to be missed!"
3,Kidd is a searcher,"This book is pre-BEES and MERMAID CHAIR. Sue Monk Kidd has an aggressive searching spirit, and the book shows a writing talent that was finally discovered in BEES. Her mid-life verbalizing is detailed and specific. However, her answers need to be examined before they are applied to your own life."
2,Nothing like Life of Bees,"I bought this book and Dissident daughter for my wife who absolutely loved ""Life of Bees"" and one other fictional story by Sue Monk Kidd . She was disappointed. Dont get Sue Monks Kidds spiritual or inspirational books based on your opinion of her well written fictional stories. It's like two completely different authors. My wife didn't even finish the Dissident Daughter."
4,Worth the time spent.,"Good as an accountability tool for ""mid-life"" women in a small group setting. It helps in taking off the masks. The questions at the back of the book are helpful in pushing one think about his or her own circumstances as they apply to the book's topics. For the most part, the book is written on a level that I can follow. However, some of the philosophical discussions are difficult to follow. Overall, I would recommend the book."
5,Life Changing Book,"I do not think one has to be a mid lifer to get the most out of this wonderful book! This book started me on my own personal spiritual journey, and I have not looked back. Sue Monk Kidd's honesty and her gift for stringing words together in a meaningful way moved me to buy the rest of her books. This one will always hold a special place in my heart however. I HIGHLY recommend this book and author."
5,Spiritual Direction--Sue Monk Kidd style,"Monk Kidd's reflective retelling of her journey from angry and distracted super-Mom and spouse to a place of peace and balance in her life has plenty of ""ah ha"" moments. A must read for every woman who has undergone those restless moments in life when they wonder where they best fit and make a difference. The more recently published ""plus"" edition has helpful study questions at the end which makes it ideal for a group discussion."
1,Spiritual pablum,"This book astounded me in its seemingly endless stream of cliches and corny metaphors, from Monk Kidd's anthropomorphization of trees (""I studied their bony arms and felt their emptiness, their desperate reach for light and sky""), to her clumsy characterizations of discovering her True Self (""there's a bulb of truth buried in the human soul,"" ""Had my masks gotten stuck to my face?"", ""Letting go is like crossing a bridge, I thought""). Monk Kidd's spiritual crisis may have been very real to her, but her description of it here strikes me as self-indulgent, sentimental claptrap. Having also read The Mermaid Chair, I would say this author is highly overrated."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a excellent value when compared to any local seller of recovery straps. My only complaint is that the hooks are just to small. The hook fits over the hook on the vehicles, but the spring loaded clip will not shut.All the research I did on recovery straps said your max pull load is 1/2 the stated capacity, but the package says the max pull recovery is 1/3? I haven't had a chance to rip a big truck out of a ditch yet, but here's hoping.Overall it is well worth the money."
5,works great,I had to use this two weeks after I bought it. I worked great. I am very glad that I have it.
4,"Strong, but hooks are huge","I ordered and received this tow strap last week. It looks well made and strong enough for any vehicle I would need to use it for, however the hooks are really big and thick and may not be able to fit into any of the tow points on my Mazda 6 ( In all fairness, I have not tried it out). The hooks will fit onto the tow loops on my pickup truck which I hope will need to be the tow-er, not the tow-ee. The strap itself could probably be looped through something and the hook clipped to the strap, but that might subject the strap to a sharp metal part on the vehicle. I bought this to replace the 3/8 inch chain with grab hooks I used to carry around because it was way too heavy.I will update this after I actually have the time to try the hooks out. VERY strong springs on the hooks too, maybe a little TOO strong."
2,Not for pulling stumps,"I purchased this tow strap specifically for pulling a stump of a 15"" cedar tree that had fallen over in my yard (with half of the root cluster unearthed) and the strap snapped in half on the second pull. The strap probably works well for its intended purposes but it is not recommended for pulling stumps."
1,very poor quality metal on the hooks,"The hooks bent on the first tow of a compact car, this could have ended very badly. I only needed to use this recently and unfortunately the return window is closed now. Steer clear of this product, spend a couple bucks more on a higher quality strap. The seller should be ashamed to peddle such swill and advertise it as 10k pounds."
3,Damaged with first pull,Tried to pull a 1000lbs beam and it began to unrivaled pull the beam but split the length of strap. Maybe I got a bad one I don't know.
4,Seems to be good,"I haven't gotten to use the tow strap yet. I bought it as a precaution, because I got stuck in the snow last year and no one had a strap to pull me out with. I keep it on my car now so that won't happen again. It's seems to be of pretty good quality and as advertised online."
4,Its a tow strap,I used it to straighten my bumper. I'll put in the truck beneath the seat for emergencies once I get the truck back on the road.
4,Heavy and well made.,Bought to carry on my 4 wheeler. Very good heavy strap with the clasp type hooks so that when towing someone or someone towing you and there is slack in the line the hooks do not fall off.
1,"Different cover, same concert","From what I can gather, this is the same concert as the ""Jazz Channel Presents Herbie Hancock: Bet On Jazz"" DVD.Tracks1. Fascinating Rhythm2. St. Louis Blues3. Cotton Tail4. Blueberry Rhyme5. The Man I Love6. Here Come De Honey Man7. Cantaloupe Island8. One Finger Snap9. Maiden VoyagePlease correct me if I am wrong."
1,What Evening?,"What is this? An evening with Herbie, where? when? No performance information, no line-up info,no nuthin'. Come on guys! Help us out with some description of this video.If we knew what we were getting, may-be we would be buying! I love Herbie but I don't want to duplicate a video I may already have. Just my point of view!"
5,OUTSTANDING,"This is a must have' very informative' with many diagrams on stances, foot positions hand positions, kicks and strikes' posture, katas , history of GOJU and the cat himself'"
3,It's OK,"You won't learn anything epic here, and especially nothing you won't get in class. Interesting perspective, but it's the japanese Goju; which means not as practical and the katas will of course have their differences. If you're really into goju, it's not a bad reference book."
1,Boring,I was tempted to by this CD and their other one because of the comparisons to Echo & the Bunnymen and the P. Furs. I don't see it. The songs drone on ... and on. Interpol is much better as a comparison to the above mentioned '80's bands. I don't want to relive the past but this group is boring.
5,Wow...it's that easy,"This product also works with Panasonic's KX-TG1031S, which is what we have. Linked great, works great, not even one problem. Saved us from having to get an entire system."
2,Buyer Beware!!!,"I like the features that this phone has to offer. It's really cool how you can check your messages directly from the phone. It's pretty easy and comfortable to use, as well. However, literally 8 days after I received it one of the speakers stopped working. This resulted in me not getting a dial tone or being able to use it unless I use it on speakerphone. The speakerphone feature does not even work that well. Whenever I use it, I have to practically hold it up to my face or people complain that they cannot hear me. I think that a product should definitely last more than a week without problems. We checked the owner's manual and sure enough, this is a common problem. We called up Panasonic and they said that they would fix it, but we would have to pay the shipping back. How out of line is that? I would not recommend this phone to anyone!"
5,"Works with my ""years old"" panasonic phone","Hard to find, but this extra handset works great with my old Panasonic base and now I have 3 extensions with intercom at my house. Also, I really like a feature that newer models now don't have: a stand alone button for intercom (its the one on the bottom right corner of the headset). Its easy, just press it then the number of the other headset you want to call; this new one was registered as 3 so I press INTERCOM+3 and talk... on newer models you need to press MENU+INTERCOM+#"
4,Easy Add on,When the talk button would not work on a earlier purchased phone the purchase of this phone was easy and easy to set up in the other's place.
2,Not much difference from 5.8 ghz,"Got this because it was advertised as ""markedly reduced interference""...it is not. Still have a lot of static."
3,great phone poor workmanship,"The phones work well with great clarity. Conferencing can be cumbersome and not always 'take hold.' When using with VOIP provider, these phones 'ring back' after disconnect. Biggest frustration - within first six months, one unit 'dead'. Two months later, second unit has line running through bottom of screen. The units definitely have Panasonic VQ but the actual product quality would keep me recommending unless I just got a bad lot."
5,Panasonic Expandealbe Handsets are great,I had purchased Panansonic Digital Cordless telephone that only came with 3 phones. I needed a couple extra and this item was exactly what I needed. They were easy to program to go with my system and work wonderful! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking!
5,Great Phone,"I first bought this phone with a extra hand set. Big mistake, I should have ordered three or four of them. Found this product easy to use and user friendly. The intercome is a welcome plus. We love it and its worth every penny. If any one should but this product I recommended buying at least the four pack. One with base & (3 extra phones .) You won't be sorry. RJ & NJ"
5,Panasonic KX-TGA101S Cordless Digital Handset,"Worked fine right out of the box. The included instructions explaining how to integrate the handset into our existing Panasonic Cordless System were excellent, simple, and idiot proof. If you have an existing Panasonic DECT6.0 Digital Phone System this is a great way to expand it."
4,Good phone but needs easy ringer switch,"This is an excellent phone system but it would be very helpful to have an easy way to turn the ringer off at night. Currently, you must follow several menu prompts."
4,Panasonic handset added to basic set,Originally purchased base unit with 1 additional phone and recently found a need for an additional handset. Find the intercom ability very useful.
5,Expansion handset,"I already owned the Panasonic KX-TG1032S Phone System for some time, and it's the best cordless phone I've ever used. I wanted to get rid of the old traditional corded phone in my basement, so getting this additional handset was a no-brainer. Adding it to my existing system was as easy as pushing 2 buttons. I like the way these handsets use standard AAA NiMH batteries too, and they don't interfere with my wireless network. Sound quality is as good as a corded phone. Great system."
5,Panasonic KXTGA101S Dect Phone's,"Great Phones, no problems with them at all. No interference on any of the phones. I liked them so much I bought a fifth one. Thanks so much for such a great buy."
1,Speakers didn't work after a few hours,"Boy was I excited to get the new wireless speakers. Sounded great, solved the problem of using the computer to be the""radio"". ...for about 4 hours then a little speaker rattle. No problem...just lower the volume... for about 1 hour..then nothing. Argh!I have to say in the defense of the speakers that while they worked the sound was fine for my ears.Maybe this was a fluke, or maybe the issue is systemic. I dunno, I'm waiting for replacements to find out."
1,No Volume-no help,"Purchased these phones based on reviews. When installed, there is no volume on the handsets. I purchased the Panasonic hands free headset, again based on reviews and you can barely hear the caller. Speakerphone allows you to hear better if you are about 1 foot away. Try another phone."
2,join a conversation???,"Other reviewers must not receive outside calls intended for the whole family. DECT phones require an awkward procedure to allow a second person to join an incoming call. And more than one additional joiner is impossible even if you have several extension phones! I'm used to being able to just ""pick up the extension"", and that's a requirement these phones can't meet."
1,Panasonic wireless phone,"The item was misleading on the web site.I thought it was a complete unit, but when received found out it was an auxiliary until and I required a mother base.I sent the unit back sent bought the right unit locally."
4,Good but with problems,"The phone reception is good, i have the base planted on the 2nd floor of my house and still can hear just fine down at the basement. My only problem is when you create a new answering machine greeting the phone, it will always display ""new voice mail"" even tho there is none. If anyone can help fix this please tell me cause its getting dam annoying.."
4,Panasonic Built a good One.,"We have the Panasonic Dect 6.0 answering device and a total of six (6)Panasonic Dect 6.o mobile telephones.I'm older(76)and have had many different telephones over the years, but this telephone is the best all around phone that I have owned. The only downer is that navigating sometimes is confusing and a little difficult to follow. Other than that, I have nothing but good things to say about this telephone and recommend it above all others that I have had in the past.."
5,Works well.,Got this system several years ago when it was state of the art. Had only one go bad and bought this replacement phone. Is exact model as the others.Is the best cordless I've ever owned. Reaches pretty far before it gets crackly. I have just one main base that all 6 of my phones go through and none have any issues with connecting or sound quality. Wish my wireless network performed as well!Will start to get bad if more than about 20-30 feet outside the house. Will barely make it to my mailbox if on the phone. Works fine in my back yard.Will definitely go Panasonic again with a more up to date model. Assuming that my system ever dies.
3,Extra Handset,"Just OK, because although the Handset# and DECT System# are correct, (Following instructions explicitly) the handset won't connect to the Base System. After reviewing the manual that came with the original phone, I was able to connect to the handset with no problem. The instructions that came with the extra handset are incomplete."
5,Great for extending.,"One of my extra handsets died so I replaced it with this. It was EXTREMELY east to pair with the base station, I was impressed!"
1,Completey Unreliable!,I bought this phone about 6 months ago. The phone will simply go dead unpredicably (since day one) - and recenty started breaking up while on a call.This model is not worth the price - I wouldn't recommend this model even if offered for free!
2,One By One The Chargers Die,"I initially bought the base unit with 2 chargers and 3 handsets. I liked the phones, but was having trouble with one charger not charging despite indicating that it was. I purchased phone batteries, thinking that might be the problem, but it made no difference. One charger was ""burned out"" despite cleaning the contacts, plugging, unplugging, etc. I bought 2 more handset/charger sets, and within 3 months one of those chargers died, along with another of my original chargers. I now have 5 phones with only 2 functioning charger bases.I just spoke to customer service who told me that only the phones are warranted, not the ""accessories"", which the chargers and cords are. He told me to go buy them on the website, that Panasonic would not stand behind the charger/cord product.I rarely write reviews, but this infuriates me and I want to warn buyers."
3,Split decision,I am split as far as what I think about this phone. I have 2 of them. One them is still working great and the other one I cannot be heard by other people when talking to them. One I never had any problems with and the other one didn't last last long after I started using it. It was too late to get it replaced but I can live with just one phone.
5,Best phone I ever had,I had a couple of the panasonic phones in the past. I have to say this one is the best. I just recently bought additional handsets. Highly recommended.
1,beep beep beep turns off,I bought my 1st set of phones and the problem I have is that while talking on a full charge the phone will make a beep beep beep then it will disconnect while I'm talking to someone...all my Panasonic KX-TGA1101s did this so I took the set back and exchanged it for the same model and these do the same thing! All phones are charged completely and registered...Panasonic help had no clue either as to why this not only happened with 1 sealed box set but 2 sealed box sets...
1,Poor quality phone.,"Poorly made, inexpensive chordless phone. Not user friendly at all. Hard to read LCD and short battery life. Would not recommend buying the Panasonic Dect 6.0"
5,Working well.,"I purchased the base phone and one remote phone about a year ago at a discount warehouse store. I liked the convenience so I ordered another remote phone from Amazon for my home office. So far, it has been working as well as the base and other remote and keeps me from having to run to another room to answer the phone. The sound quality, battery time, and durability are excellent."
5,Linking the additional phone was a touch tricky,"I have been _very_ happy with the three panasonic phones we purchased one year ago. So much so, that my wife asked me to get one more phone for our bedroom so that we could make the most use of the intercom function.However, the instructions for linking this phone to the base unit only tell you what buttons to press on the base unit. It neglects to tell you that you need to go into the menus on the handset to put it into the correct mode to link to the exisiting base unit. Again, not too hard when you know what to look for, but it would have been nice of Panasonic to tell you...Great: range, clarity, battery life, speaker phone and ring tones.Poor: I wish the intercom would Auto Answer, but that is probably to prevent eavse dropping..."
1,terrible,These phones don't provide a steady signal and cut off mid call. Often. It was surprising since the phone had such good reviews.
5,Good deal - thanks!,Thanks for the decent price and quick shipment on this item. It is working great & was a lifesaver when both of my extensions died within a day of each other; but I didn't want to buy a whole new unit when the answering device still worked. I'm hoping this extension will last longer than a couple years.
2,cheap phone,"bought the item but very disappointedthe features on the phone is very limitedit doesn't have the capability to connected to the base. that's why you going to see the massageyou are out of rage get closer to the base, even though you are about 15' awayand the sound is badbut it's cheap :)"
1,would not buy again,"I got these phones about 3 years ago and was disappointed from the first day. I should have gotten something else right away, but did not.My biggest gripe is that if your voice gets a little loud, the ear piece seems to cut out and you think the phone has gone dead, thus in the beginning I was doing a lot of ""are you still there?"" Now I know it's just a bad feature of the phone.I also have, as another reviewer has mentioned, that out of nowhere, you get a beep beep beep and your call is gone. You haven't done anything different but it happens. ????At other times it won't show a caller ID. It will say incoming call and that's it.Other times when the phone is ringing, I get one continuous ring for about 45 seconds straight. Very strange.All of the other features are standard like any other phone and are fine once you figure them out and get used to them.I would not buy these phones again and am currently looking for a new system, that's how I wound up here! Caio!"
4,Panasonic DECT 6.0 Handset,"I bought two extra handsets to go along with the base unit + four handsets. With six phones, we now have the house covered. The two new handsets synced right away with the base. Range is exceptional, great reception in the garage, out in the yard, down the street. No interference with wireless internet!!! Only downside is having to press too many buttons to view and erase caller ID numbers/names. Answering machine is easy to program and review messages. Sound thru the earhole is above average, tho I have never had a phone, landline or cell, that has exceptional listening."
1,Just plain lame.,"This magazine has a catchy title and very nice graphics and photography. What the premier issue lacks is anything of any substance about guns or hunting. I wonder if they actually read their own title. In my opinion these guys are nothing more than posers from the guns/hunting standpoint and many of the photographs appear to be staged. In particular, there are a couple pictures of a woman shooting a bow and arrow. Not only is she showing extremely poor form she's using the equipment shown in the photographs incorrectly. This is tantamount to using spinning gear with the reel positioned over the top of the fishing pole. If they want to cover hunting they should at least hire a photo editor that knows what (s)he's looking at. If you want a hunting magazine buy something else..."
1,Where is the exciting stuff?,"This magazine is too bland and boring. I mean, it doesn't deal with the really meaty and exciting parts of Southern culture: the cross burnings, chattel slavery, segregated restrooms, hurricane Katrina, etc.I suspect this publication might actually be a front for scalawags!"
2,"If you need to shop for a $20,000 watch, this magazine is for you","I really wanted to like this magazine. It is beautifully edited and photographed, but alas, its entire contents feel like an advertisement to the upper-middle-class-aspiring-to-look-monied-and-well-bred. If the very fact that they offer ""Garden & Gun Secret Society Weekends"" does not irritate you and remind you of some elitist Good Ol' Boys Club from decades past, you may like the magazine just fine.Though I've let my subscription lapse, the circulation department has been sending me renewal notices for several months. I wish I'd never subscribed."
4,Pleasant Listening,"The songs are a mix of nicely done piano and guitar with pleasant, lively and stylish arrangements of pop music with a slight Spanish flair. You'll enjoy it as you work."
5,Very Helpful To Any Blue Ridge Collector,I found this very useful. I have seven different Blue Ridge Pottery books that I used to identify over 1000 pieces I owned. Now I have dispursed my collection and have no use for my books so I will sell them.
1,"REALLY REALLY BAD, WHAT A WASTE","This film has potentially interesting story that has given some promise, but as a whole it was terribly executed by a really bad director and ever worse cinematographer. The music score is pretty atrocious, emotionally all over the place. The performances are decent, but that does not help this film a tiny bit. It is actually painful to watch this hodgepodge confusion of film genre, style, dramatic focus, and emotional wandering. STAY AWAY FROM IT AT ANY PRICE!!!"
4,Milwaukee random orbit sander,"I have 3 porter cable, 2 Makita, and 1 Fein random orbit sanders. Only the fein comes close as far as agressiveness. The only drawback is that there is no vacuum provision."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed. I thought the film was definitely beautiful and deeply meaningful with respect to the cinematography. However, I was looking for more of a biographic film that depicted her life and writings and thought. I didn't get this. Instead, this film was more about the director and cinematographer's talents than about the subject: Edith Stein. I am not sure I would recommend it."
1,I just don't like it,"I can't get past the second story. I think it's a matter of personel taste, but as I'm reading...my interest fades. The short sentence, the ambiguous language...I guess I need something meatier and more colorful. The language seems simple and too subtle. Some people love this style...and sometimes I do. For me, Joy just doesn't pull it off. If you like Raymond Carver, you'll love this. Guess what? I don't."
2,"Philips products good, but service terrible","I have had a Nino 320 for almost a year and it is a wonderful machine, I bought a 510 last week and loved it too, but the 320 started to randomly reboot right after I got the 510. It took Philips 3 days to get me an RMA # with me calling them twice a day. I overnighted it to them and they took 2 more days before they started to look at it, 3 days later, they still have it. All the while their customer service people give wildly contradictory stories about the repair process and its time frame. It seems that they are in a contest to dupe the most customers. I sent the 510 back. To compare, I had an HP Jornada with a software glitch, got an RMA from HP on the first call, sent it to them overnight that day. They fixed it the next day and overnighted it back. Philips has the absolute worst customer service department I have ever dealt with. Buyer beware!"
4,Replace that old organizer with the Nino 510--Now!,"Well this father's day present isn't small enough to fit in my shirt pocket, but fits nicely in my briefcase. Very portable, solid, and easy to use. I take it everywhere with me, and plan to continue doing so. I give this electronic item two thumbs up."
1,Nino - No wonder they quit making it,"Dealing with Philips customer service is like pulling teeth...and since I just had a tooth pulled, I know what I'm talking about. The docking system for the Nino 510 is terrible-50% operational rate. A crack formed on my touch screen and grew all the way accross it. Of course it had to be my fault (even though Nino is always in my hand or in its case). When I ask if 100% of the Ninos coming of the Korean assembly line had no cracks form in the touch screen, the answer was no. But anyway, $177 to fix a $300 unit. Don't buy one."
4,Nino Better than the Rest,"First, let's cut to the chase. The Nino is the best Windows CE device on the market. It's sturdy and easy to use and the new color display is clearest there is. The Casio device looks as if it would crack if you touched it the wrong way and HP's new PDA is too bulky to be practical.A constant criticism of Windows CE devices are the multitude of software options that aren't really useful. But, I love the voice recognition software and the digital messaging. I use it to recap sales calls all the time.I too had some problems with installation, so I sympathize with the previous comments. If Philips has indeed discontinued the Nino, I hope their replacement is even better."
4,"Great workouts, stinky gas!","I don't usually get gassy from protein powder or other supplements, but man, this stuff tore me up. I went through two bottles, and never got used to it.My workouts got better quickly. I track all my lifts, sets and reps, and started seeing improvement about two weeks in. I had been stalled on my big lifts for a while and was looking for something to get me off my plateau, and this certainly did it. My deadlift was the first to start moving, with a couple extra reps per set, or maybe another set at the end. I definitely felt more endurance. My bench press followed. But man, I'd have to go find an isolated spot to let 'em rip, because they were bad!I ended up moving to a different brand, and don't have the gas anymore. I'm a non-responder to creatine, but I'm making gains with beta-alanine, so it's staying in the mix."
2,Missing In Action,"Man I couldn't wait to get this little number. I've worn a K bar neck knife for a long time without any problems but wanted the Buck as it is made in the USA.I was happy when it arrived and immediatly switched it out with the K bar. I wore it one time and when I got home discovered that the sheath was not designed to keep the knife secure and the knife was gone. Wasted money.If you decide to purchase the product take my advice and wear it in your boot or you won't have it long. I won't buy another as I feel it didn't live up to the hype. Guess who's wearing a K bar made in China right now.Buck StonebrokeNew Caney, Texas"
3,not bad,its a good little knife made of great steel but its not so aesthetically pleasing and i dont like the sheath much plus it didnt come as sharp as i like to see my knives but its a good little knife.its worth a shot it might end up being your everyday carry but for me personally go for the cold steel mini pendelton thats a great everyday carry knife.
2,hard to use,"the major problem with this knife is the length of the handle. the handle is about big enough for 2 1/2 fingers, so you end up using the lanyard as a handle. the fact it is a ""Neck Knife"" makes it a pain to carry. You can't just toss it in your pocket and go. one plus is the fact it is light and probably durable. I also own the Gerber EVO JR which is what I would recommend instead."
2,buy a razor for 25cents,"The length of two razors, the maneuverablity of one razor, the price of a 7"" kabar? The only effective way to use this knife is to pinch between thumb and first two fingers. I would recomend punching a hole in a box-cutter and looping some paracord through before i would recomend this because at least your razor will have a handle. On the upside - would be a good gift for a VERY responsable child."
3,outdated,"Obviously, this book is old and a classic. However, it really does show its age. The book obsesses over the distinction between totalitarian and authoritarian systems. However, 50 years later the distinction doesn't look as crucial as it once did, especially given the lack of totalitarian regimes. This book is worth getting to know if you do a lot of work on the USSR, Nazi Germany, or other totalitarian regimes, but probably won't help much for authoritarian regimes more broadly."
1,Sportline walking advantage flashing walking light,My wife and I walk a hour each night and felt we needed some king of a night light for protection from automobile so we purchased two of these walking lights from you last month. One lasted 1 and 1/2 hours before going blank. The other one lasted less than 5 hours. These is a terrible product. Would never recommedd it to anyoneJack M Ruffing
2,Goodlight for a while. Poor quality,"This worked great for a while and then the switch started acting up. Eventually I would have to unscrew the battery every time I used it. That had the downside of not being able to toggle between the different light strobe settings. It is very light, but quickly stopped working."
2,Couldn't Get the Battery Case Open,"I bought two of these. I had read reviews that said the battery cover was a problem, but I have lots of tools, including tools for tiny screws, so I thought I'd be all right. Not! I was able, finally, to get the case off of one of them, and so will be using it. The other -- just couldn't budge that screw, and ended up stripping the head. Amazon is refunding for the one, which is great -- but what a nuisance! Not only is the screw REALLY tiny, but it is Phillips head and in really tight."
1,Don't waste your money,I'm not sure what it was supposed fit but I couldn't get it to line up with my cover. I have an 04 5.9 Cummins I just used RTV instead.
4,Easy and practicle guide to changing behavior,"I have worked with criminal offenders for the last 10 years and have found this approach outlined in the book extremely useful. The book is easy to read and follow. I have used the information with Batterers, sex offenders and substance abusers. The only offenders I have found it not appropriate for are ""diagnosed"" psychopaths."
2,Pay very close attention to its listed dimensions,"This item's dimensions are listed as 15 1/2"" W x 43 3/4"" H (just a little over 3.5 feet) x 7 1/2"" D.While it is a fairly attractive piece, I do not believe that it is worth the $40.03 I paid for it.It's many parts were packed and labeled nicely, but the shelves still had some scuff marks on them. One shelf's edge looks warped as if it had once gotten wet. This might be due to poor quality control inspection prior to packing since the box did not appear damaged.While I would not exactly call it sturdy, it should hold the DVDs I plan on storing in it. I would not put anything too heavy on the shelves since the boards looks awfully thin. I would stay away from storing CDs in slim jewel cases or stacking things vertically on the shelves.I would not be as disappointed in this product had it been priced under $25."
1,"No order, no guiding, no progression","I bought this because it seemed like the right software for me, based on the description on the box. Boy was I wrong... this learning software has no guided instruction at all. Successful sofware will teach you a few basics, then test you to make sure that you understand them, then add a little more to the mix, then test you, etc.. that way, you aren't thrown into the middle.. in this case, you're thrown into the middle of this mess called ""Learn Spanish Now"". Supposedly it has videos in it, but I never could even figure out how to play them.. and I am an avid directions reader..This is very poor software. If you already know some spanish, this may be the way to go, but if you don't I'd suggest you spend your money elsewhere."
3,Ok remote,Its ok I guess was hoping it would work on my tv/DVD RCA. Only works on the tv part and won't program to the DVD at all...
1,"RCA Remote - Flashes, but won't control the TV!","We purchased this for my elderly mother. We programmed it, and it worked, but a few days later she told us it was inoperative.At this point, all it does is ""flash"" when pointed at the TV, but it will not control the TV at all! I've taken the batteries out, tried to reprogram it, all to no avail. And I've done this more than once!I bought one of those ""All in Ones"", (however, this one just controls the TV), and it seems to be working fine. Sorry to see others have also had trouble with the RCA unit."
5,The one remote I use most,"It doesn't have all the buttons to control all features of various componants. But it does have the main ones we normally use most.Controls volume, mute, channel, previous channel, ok, input, sleep, info along with the usual vcr/media controls like play pause, etc..I purchased it mainly because it is backlit and controls 4 devices. So far I am using it with three and all three work just fine. All the buttons do not lite up though. It skips the 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 number buttons. Not a real big deal since you can still see the other numbers from the backlit buttons.It is smaller than my other remotes and frankly, easier to use. A very good layout.This was shipped to me from Beach Audio and they came across as VERY straight, honest and wanting to know if everything is ok judging by a the emails they sent me after my order, during shipment and once it was delivered.I wish all online companies were as concerned about customer service as Beach Audio.No, I do not work there."
1,Another bad one from Lommel,"This supposed horror movie tries to be an artsy psychological horror drama but fails miserably. It's about a young woman who has been abandoned by everyone and is now held in a basement by some man. That's all plot there is except for some flashback sequences of her childhood. The movie relies heavily one first person narration and the pace is extremely slow and nothing much happens in the movie. The sound and picturequality is as bad as Lommel's other recent movies, that is about as cheap as it gets. The soundtrack combines random noises and annoying piano music.Dungeon Girl doesn't work as a drama nor as a horror movie. It's just plain bad and doesn't deserve your time or money."
1,Because Amazon Forces You To Provide A Star,"Twenty word minimum. Okay.Student film gone awry and the best argument against giving them digital cameras and desktop editing software. At least in the past the prohibitive cost of film and the accompanying production prevented this kind of junk from being produced and mass marketed. Not all progress can be defined as bettering our condition.Pointless, superficial, idiotic, completely and utterly worthless.You're better off throwing your money out the car window, at least that'll make someone happy.An update of the current grading scale needs to include half-stars and the all-important Zero.This steaming pile = zero."
1,Oh so bad,"Cheap-looking. Poorly written ""narration"" delivered in monotone by the ""heroine"" will make you cringe. Unexplained reason for the kidnap adds to the idiocy. The victim ages from 12 yrs old to 18 yrs old during the storyline of the film, yet her appearance never changes. Really? Didn't want to put any more actors on the payroll or what? This one's just baa-ad."
5,I wanted to save money,It really works great. I have been going to the salon but it just gets too costly. This worked just as well. I was thought I might screw it up but I did just fine.
2,Magellan 600 Poor customer service,"I recently purchased an explorist 600. I have called customer service for advice on upgrading, adding maps, etc on this unit. Their customer service is very unresponsive, to the point that they are almost rude. I have spent over two hours on hold for them, to finally get an agent that speaks limited English. I have emailed them, asking an english speaking representative to call me to no avail. They don't seem responsive, are almost scornful to the average person with limited GPS capability. I'm forced to return."
1,Magellan has no support!,I have the explorist 600. Using this GPS in the field is a pleasure. Uploading the detail maps are a total pain. Not intuitive at all. My major complaint is the proprietary usb/charging cord has been unavailable for over two months! Magellan support has no clue as to when the cord will again be available. Therefore I cannot charge the battery and cannot use the gps. I will never buy their products again.
2,Why did I change my mind?,"I was all set to by a Garmin and let myself be talked into buying this. Short and sweet XP Pro doesn't recognize the driver even if you say it's ok. Installs it but, won't use it. That means the GPS will not communicate with the computer. MapSend Direct is also imcompatable with XP Pro so it doesn't matter if it talks to the computer or not. I've sent off my e-mails to Magellan but, I hear their support is sad. I hope my credit card company can help me recover some of my money. The GPS seems to be quite fast, accurate and sensitive...compared to my 8 year old ColorTrak which has no problem with XP Pro."
1,Magellan eXplorist Models are the worst!,"Two times I tried to get Magellan support and was on hold for 45 minutes the first time and the second time I was on hold for more than 60 mintues until the support office closed at 8:00 pm EST at which time no one was going to answer. The support is terrible without question.Now lets talk about the product. My two month old Magellan eXplorist 500 has died. First it lost it BaseMap which was a pain to replace. I had to pull the battery, replace the batter, reboot the unit and go into reformat mode. Then copy the BaseMap back into the unit and life was good for about a week. Now it cuts off on it's own requiring the battery to be pulled to reset and turn the unit back on. After doing this a few times for a few days, it has now finally died and now I'm stuck with a broken GPS and no support. YOU THINK THIS WILL BE THE LAST MAGELLAN I BUT?"
3,"Very Basic, But Fine For A Quick Refresher","This book is dated and probably not worth your time but if for nothing more than a refresher, it's also not terrible. However, I got it for my Kindle 2 and having read all of the more popular org dev books I thought I'd give it a try.The point is that if you align strategy, people, customers, and processes, you stay aligned in your business. I guess if you don't already know this, then this is a good book. If you do, skip it and re-read good to great or built to last."
1,Would've been better if it was actually in Braille,"This book was nice, but was only in English for seeing people. It would have been much better if the Braille was actually readable, so the Blind could read the story, too. Considering this children's book was $20, a book about the Blind should be accessable to them as well."
4,Great to use during Disability Month,Loved reading this book to classes when teaching others about disabilities. The book is short which keeps the kids' attention. Loved it!
4,Good for travel,"Some people have recommending buying only one small purrell case and to keep refilliong it from a much larger one to save money. I tried that and it was a pain, I spilled a lot and it took a lot of time. These are much better for just a bit more money."
5,Mandie Books are the Greatest,Mandie Books are the best. I enjoy reading them. They are full of excitment and adventure. My favourite character is Snowball. I wish that I could read them for ever non-stop. My favourite book would have to be 'Mandie and the School Houses Secret.' This book is very fimilar because Iam exactly like that. Mandie Books are really cool. My friends and I always read them! We can't put it down! You can't stop!
5,A must-read handbook for self cultivation,"During the first perusal of this book, I could not believe that it was written by a contemporary Buddhist master. Master Nan's scope of understanding and wealth of knowledge far outstrips any contemporary expert in the study of Buddhism. What is characteristic of this bursar of knowledge is the accessibility of the reader to the content of the book. Although possibly diluted through translation, the genius of Professor Nan's organization of content carefully guides the reader in his/her self cultivation. Despite Master's reputation as a renown statesman in Asia, and despite the popularity of his books amongst Buddhist practitioners and the academia, this treasure house of information has been a well kept secret amongst the public."
4,Great scrapbooking resource book!,"This book is divided into two major sections. The first part covers all the stuff you will need to complete a scrapbook and some tips and techniques. The second part (and largest) is a project guide that describes 35 different album themes. Each theme has 1 layout shown. Some themes are: Grade school, boy scout, heritage, anniverary, decade, portrait and christmas albums."
2,Very disappointed,This publication was very disappointing. I expected much more than it had . did not hav near enough detailand explanations were very vague and incomplete.
2,Fudge failed attempt at an '80's sound,"Don't get me wrong - I've loved the Vanilla Fudge since their first LP was released. First time I saw them, they were supposed to open for Cream. Cream didn't show up, and I was actually happy because it meant the Fudge would play longer. But ""Mystery"" was a let-down. Vinnie Martell plays very little on it and, worse, Mark Stein (one of the most underrated rock musicians ever) plays very little B-3 organ. He mostly uses what were the most modern synths of the Eighties, and it just doesn't sound like the classic Fudge. The songs are OK (""My World Is Empty Without You"" was an inspired choice for a cover) but not particularly memorable. I saw the Fudge with the original line-up a couple years ago and they are as good as ever. Stick with the first album, ""Renaissance,"" (their best) and ""Near the Beginning."""
3,nice smooth jazz cd,I had heard a bluesy piano track on xm radio and bought the cd to hear the rest. well done but not memorable for the most part
3,Gregg Karukas: Heatwave,"Enjoyed this CD. ""Too cool"" and ""Home to You"" are my favorites. Good smooth jazz. ""Remember When"" is a beautiful,quiet, haunting melody. My wonderful daughter recently past away. This song reminds me of the many loving memories I have of my all too short time with her. I would recommend albumns ""GK"" and ""You'll Know It's me""."
4,Heatwave CD Review,"Classic GK, nicely done and very polished. It has all the makings of a top twenty CD. Kirk Whalum adds a nice touch with his soulful sax. I recommend it to all GK fans, if you liked ""Blue touch"" as I do, you will appreciate ""Heatwave"""
5,"An inspired selection, an overwhelming talent!","It's rigorously impossible to make any list of the major exponents of the smooth jazz in those times without include this hyper talented keyboardist. Greg Karukas admirable musical talent is carved I relief once more with this successful work. He has not only a kaleidoscopic vision about how to ensemble and produce those engaging themes filled with fantastic musical curtains and expressive moods.This was my second album acquired after Blue touch, and my recommendation is absolute: go for this amazing album."
4,Amazing Pictures,"James A. Michener adds class to any work. His introduction to the work compelled me to buy what is essentially a picture book. Taken from strange angles and sometimes impossible proximity, from breathtaking sunrises in Navada canyons to hundreds of insects on a plant, it is a tribute to the natural beauty of North America."
3,"Good, short survey of 16th century Europe","The Age of Reformation by E. Harris Harbison is part of the Development of Western Civilization series from Cornell Univeristy Press. Harbison was a professor of history at Princeton University. The book has three chapters: The European World about 1500, The Religious Upheaval and The Struggle for Power. This book is as much an overview of the 16th century as it is a description of the Reformation itself. Harbison ties in the political interplay between Spain, Netherlands, England and France that was such an important part of that era. He shows that the battles and skirmishes of the Reformation and the Counter Reformation were not just matters of faith, but were also about land, power and money. He gives ample ink to the rise and fall of Spain as a major transitional power between the Middle Ages and the Age of Enlightenment. This little book would be an excellent companion toThe Reformation (History of the Church) (v. 3)orThe Reformation."
4,Vent End Wall Cap,I had to build an end cap structure for our particular installation. This product works as it should but the duct slats have to be weighted some to keep them from flapping when the wind blows hard. Otherwise it's constructed well and appears as though it will last a very long time.
2,overpriced!!!,very overpriced for what it is.Does not provide any kind of backdraft sealing.Once installed the gravity dampers would not return to closed position.Had to spray with WD-40 and still it sometimes stays stuck in open position.Do not recommend.
1,Buy the unbundle...,Don't buy the bundle Buy the software and the DVD separately and save about $40....
5,Screenwriting made easy,"My first screenplay was formatted manually, and I know I made some mistakes. Final Draft will help eliminate those errors. I am looking forward to thanking Final Draft when I win the Oscar for Best Screenplay!"
3,"Compelling, but needs a good copy edit","I am enjoying this book, but the numerous grammatical errors (ex.: the use of ""it's"" to indicate the possessive, as opposed to ""its"") are beginning to prove distracting. In this day and age, there is no excuse for such inattention to detail on the part of the publisher."
1,Hated It!,"It's basically a soft porn film. The dialogue is so boring. It's just flashes of the ladies either in the bedroom or riding horses on the beach. Maybe it was too deep for me. I really hated it, though and I'm a huge fan of gay and lesbian love stories."
2,So bad that it's laughable,"This :40 clunker is so bad it's hilarious. For starters, the coastline is so not England, the tresses on the ""Byron"" character is certainly 1990s Maxim chick but not 19th century siren, and the music during the sex scenes sounds like it was inspired by a strip club pole dance. After all the yada-yada and blah-blah, what you finally get is tedious lesbian soft porn garnished with moaning and groping."
1,Pretentious,"Wayward, masculine persona gallops in to a seaside villa to reunite and romp with her more feminine counterpart. It was more like nude yoga or Cirque de Soliel than a passionate love story. To say that the entire presentation was any less than utterly self-absorbed and pretentious would be a huge stretch. I may not be the most qualified to rate this genre, but I can still recognize that the story, acting, and chemistry are far better in films like A Room in Rome or Summer Lover."
1,Cynara (for wolfe only),"This is not a main-stream movie. Do not waste time or money with it. Nothing positive about it. Deserves less than one star, but ....."
2,"Lovely women, lousy film, worse dialog","In keeping with her previous movie, Claire of the Moon, director Nicole Conn has included plenty of smoldering glances, lots of walking on the beach, smoking and drinking, and inane dialog (more like narration in this instance, as well as the puzzling question of whether, in spite of the apparent attraction, these women actually like one another). Some segments are absolutely lovely, but the movie is disjointed above and beyond the intended feel of vignettes. The stereotypes of 19th century rebel-without-a-cause butch/femme roles make the characters painfully predictable and the lack of plot a given. On the other hand, if the intended purpose of viewing is to watch impeccably dressed, beautiful women kissing and undressing, look no further."
1,Not at all what I thought it could have been ....,"This movie could have been so much more if time and effort was put into it .. very disapointing.. there were no love scenes worth mentioning .. just two models posing .. there was no story line, not to mention neither one of the charaters said more than 20 words between them ....the movie is only 30 min. or so long ...I dont think I could have stood it much longer . If you must see this movie rent it or get it used somewhere . I enjoyed the end credits better than the movie ."
2,Urgh,"I have no doubt that this film is sincere - there's a little documentary at the end about the making of it, and everybody seems to be having a good time, laughing and joking and all that. Sincerity is great, but it doesn't mean that something created sincerely is any good.If you ignore the silly 'romantica' label, 'Cynara' is basically lesbian soft-porn. For fifteen minutes two women walk around a variety of olde-worlde settings (with a cod-classical soundtrack which appears to have been composed on a General MIDI synth) looking misty-eyed; for the next fifteen minutes they roll around naked on a bed.It's shot on video and looks it, there isn't really any acting, and it's roughly on the level of a Penthouse video (with less rude). The 'romantica' label appears to be an attempt to make it seem artier than it is."
2,Nicole misses again.,"Nicole Conn has ""outdone herself"" on this one? Maybe that's part of the problem. She should stick to documentary work, these movies (Claire of the Moon also) are lacking. She has yet to cast anyone who could ""act"", I mean really ACT, worth a nickel. The women in this movie were attractive, but they had no chemistry since they were just ""models"" posing and showed no hint of emotion that seemed real. The sound quality is poor, just like in Claire. There isn't much of a story, this is just a film of period costumes, glances, sexual tension and then ""the act"" itself. OK, it was sorta hot, but clearly choreographed. The artistry was nice though."
1,Oh my god are you serious?,"Cynara: Poetry in Motion could do it's self a favour and just keep motioning on out the door and into the trash. I've seen alot of Lesbian movies and I think this would have to be my number one WORST. Just think, you'd have worked a whole hour to pay for this, don't waste your time or money."
1,Sleep is a Good Thing,"It's not porn, though the lack of a plot serves to move it in that direction. It's not interesting enough to be a drama and it's very definitely not an action film, since half of the movie is taken up with poetry that can only make one wonder what this movie is all about. In the end you'll be sadly disappointed when it ends and that question has never been answered. It has no plot, no character development and seemingly no reason for ever being made. In other words, it's a complete waste of time."
2,Bizarre,"This was a very different movie. I watched it, but it was not what I was expecting. Not being a professional critic, Bizarre, describes it best."
3,some will like it... I'm not one of them,"hmmm... poor sound quality.. poor acting. Great costumes..beautiful scenery. I was unmoved by the plot (was there a plot?) and the sex scenes were lukewarm for my personal taste. I do know people who would like it. Maybe you would. As a poet the ""poetry in motion"" subtitle was laughable."
1,Accident,I thought it looked good but OMG- don't even thing about it. Such a B movie. I watched 5 minutes...and that's 5 minutes of my life I would love to have BACK!
4,I like it !!!,"I really like this so called ' romantica '. But I do think it could've been better from all the hype it got, I expected a little more somewhat . I do think its great and the characters interacted with one another and unlike the other lesbian oriented movies that looks acted, this one doesn't look it at all ..."
4,The Runner's Repair Manual,A must read book for any runner at all stages of fitness and running experience.
2,Not worth my money,"This book was very outdated (as a few reviewers mentioned already - implying girls stop running at a younger age than boys; referencing products that are not common as if they were). Also, the pictures were not very clear and seemed to show the same thing for different ailments. I work as an engineer for an orthopedics company, specifically focusing on products for the hands/feet, and even I had trouble following the ""illustrations."" The tone of the book was also very condescending."
5,Great Buy,"Received this book fairly quickly, bought it as a present and one for myself because it was a helpful book. Great Buy."
5,Amazing book!,"I really like how the author goes into detail on healing techniques. He just doesn't tell you how to diagnose your injuries, but also how to heal them and prevent them in the future."
2,Not for dealing with your own child.,"I bought this book for help with dealing with my daughter who has PTSD. This book reads like it was written for a social worker. It did not give me any insight into dealing with her issues. I would recommend for anyone who deals with abused children, no necessarily PTSD or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder."
4,Very useful book,"Agree with the reviewer below; the construction methods can seem a bit complex. But this ain't clip art, and the meditation needed to grasp the framework is part of why we're doing this particular form of art in the first place, no?Even as a straightforward source of material to adapt to your own artwork (I work at a scale of roughly 1/4"" to 1'), it's rich. I love the pages of permutations.I think this is my third favorite Meehan (fils?) book, after Knots and Spirals."
2,Not All that,"The book is defiently not the best book I have ever read, matter of fact while my friends in some weird way seemed to had enjoyed the crap ot of it I seem total dumbfounded by the constant rapes and the worst of all the freaking verbal abuse!!!! It got on my freakin nerves I threw the book On several occasion. What really kept me semi going even though the male hero was obnoxious and rude and everything a hero shouldnt be the image she had set for him in my opinion was this darling sexy man sssooooo I kept reading. Curiosity killed the cat, well I'll be dead. To curious to know what had happen I had end up finishing it and semi-liking. It could have been much better thats certain and I'm glad I didnt judge the author on this one book I end up reading another book from her (my first time reading her work) and really LOVED THE BOOK! (Nobody's Angel) it was so beautiful.I Say save yourself the trouble on reading the book and read her other works."
2,The only one,"I love Karen Robards' novels and don't let this one keep you from getting all the others but i must say this one was a disappointment. I kept waiting for him(jon) to actually make love to her but i reached halfway through but he never did i could not even finish it but i reccomend all the other karen Robards books, she is the only reason i am buying of the internet since i cannot find all her books elsewhere."
4,a Real Pirate,"Prepare yourself for a true pirate, or do not read this book.(*Rape scenes.)He is a nasty viscious cutthroat. I waited on the fleeting moments Cathy was able to wring a drop of kindness out of him.Jon was a neglected child who left home at sixteen to sail. Later, he became a pirate; committing robbery on the high seas! Not a licensed privateer, buccaneer, a sailor w/ a cause, or anything otherwise excused.Yes, there were the misunderstandings as other reviews noted, but compared to other writers ... the conflicts didn't drag out. The build-ups and anticipation kept it exciting without being frustrating.I loved it!"
1,I give it 1 star because Zero isn't Available......,"This is the worst book I have read in a very long time. I was really looking forward to reading this because I had just finished a few really good Robard books, but this was tedious to say the least. Throughout the whole novel Jon Hale ( I can't say hero) is abusing the heroine. First he kidnaps her then he rapes her over and over again and she despises him, and then in a blink she falls in love with him. How do you do that when he never treats you with any respect or even kindness. So he beats her, rapes her, calls her names, then they get married and he calls her a bith and a whore and then ten pages before the book ends he is raping her again!! And the worst part is I found out she made a sequel to this novel, Hmmmmmmmm....I wonder how he is going to treat her in that one. Don't waste your time with this book, I regret buying it."
1,Rape is not Romance!,I've enjoyed reading several of Karen Robards books. This is not one that I could even finish. Rape has no place in a romance. I was very disappointed.
2,Not my type of 'romance'....,"I fully understand that women were looked at much else besides bodies, ect, in this time period, but this book didn;t appeal to me. I don't usually get offended, actually its hard to offend me, but Jonathan (the pirate) is so abusive and careless with Catherine, it was hard to even believe he loved her at all. I tried so hard to look past his brutishness for the sake of it being 1845 and him having a rough childhood, but I just could'nt accept that he ever loved her or ever would. He seemed to be taking his aggressions and past aggressions and anger that had nothing to do with her out on her. It never stopped, not once. She loved him and did all she could for him selflessly and he still took things out on her. I could not warm up to him no matter how hard I tried. I was wishing she would've escaped and he would've been hanged, sorry, just being honest. The sequel to this is 'Sea Fire'...Tracy Talley~@"
3,Meant to give this five stars..,"There are probably alot of feminist women who would like to thrash me for calling this a great book, but it is so out of the norm of other historical romances today. The hero, Jon, (yes ladies, i said hero) is a rather brutish male. However, this is the most historically accurate book i have ever read about the differences between men and women in that time period. He is an arrogant selfish man even up to the last two pages in the novel. Throughout the whole book, he insults and forces himself on her, but she gives him just as much as he dishes out. This book will always be one of my favorites, just because of the way that Karen Robards details the way a REAL relationship usually works."
1,"Disgusting portrayal of ""Love""..","It amazes me that a woman could think this a ""love"" story much less a romance. It was bad enough that he RAPED her at the beginning, you could kinda get past that, but I have to say that the last RAPE would have been totally unforgivable. NO ONE falls inlove with there rapist! The age difference I could handle but the violence was pitiful. I think I would have liked it better had he been hanged in the end..."
5,island flame,another great piece of karen robards' repetoire. a worthwhile read with all the angst and passion and forgiveness nessescary for this fats paced pirate novel
3,Wasnt that bad,"I enjoyed the book. Yes I could have done without the rape, but I still could enjoy the book. It was not your typical romance so if thats what your looking for than this book isnt for you, but it does break up the typical story line of a historical romance. I think some readers forget she was also playing a game with him. He wasnt the only one controlling the situation!"
4,Incredible Hulk Magnetic Hero,"This was a Christmas gift for my six year old son. He already has the spiderman magnetic guy and this one is just as great. High quality and extremely durable...as long as you keep track of the parts. A little expensive, but worth it."
5,DESEO CARNAL-UN PASEO INFERNAL,"Alaska Y Dinarana not of the Best. THE BEST OF THE 80'Sin this Deseo Carnal you'll find great songs like the hit NI TU NI NADIE and COMO PUDISTE HACERME ESTO AMI. you will also enjoyISIS-""ni mitra ni nadie me van a enganar, yo espero sentada por que yo se la verdad y voy a gritar"" one of the songs that Alaska always sing in their FANGORIA concerts, UN HOMBRE DE VERDAD (so many man, i love man and raining man 80's disco version) CARNE HUESOS Y TU great song to play for a HALLOWEN night party FALSAS COSTUMBRES and DESEO CARNAL 2 great songs.full cd to enjoy."
5,DECEO CARNAL....DECEO MORTAL....DELICIA TOTAL.,"TODAVIA DESPUES TANTO TIEMPO DE SER LANZADO ESTE DISCO,SIGUE SIENDO UNO DE LOS MEJORES DISCOS DE ROCK EN ESPANOL,CADA CANCION SUENA COMO NUEVA TODO EL DISCO ES FABULOSO,CONTIENE UNAS DE LAS CANCIONES MAS CONTROVERCIALES QUE SE AN ECHO EN NUESTROS TIEMPOS COMO ""COMO PUDISTE HACERME ESTO AMI""QUE TRATA DE ADULTERIO Y CRIMENES MORTALES POR CELOS,""DECEO CARNAL""TRATA DE ALCOHOLISMO Y SEXO CASUAL,""UN HOMBRE DE VERDAD""EL TITULO LO DICE TODO,""ISIS""DESCRIBE UN SUBIDON DE ALGUNA CLASE DE DROGA ALUCINOGENA,TAMBIEN INCLUYE EL SUPER EXITO""NI TU,NI NADIE"".MUSICALMENTE ESTE DISCO ES RICO EN MATICES QUE DE REPENTE TE RECUERDAN A PINK FLOYD PERO EN UN ESTILO PROPIO, COMPRALO NO TE ARREPENTIRAS."
4,simple and cute intro for the littlest yogis,"Cute and very simple book. From a yoga teacher's perspective, the progression of poses could have been presented in a different order to allow for a smoother flow. But my toddler doesn't seem to mind standing up, than getting on the ground, than getting back up again, and then getting back on the ground again. (as a tired old mommy might!)"
2,great book but not toddler-proof,I was so excited to get this book for my two year old daughter. We checked out Little Yoga from the library and ever since she had been doing poses. The first day we bought it she promptly pulled an entire page out by turning the page just a little aggressively. I didn't expect that the page would come out so easily so was disappointed in the quality. Otherwise it is a great read and entertaining for kids.
4,Great for toddlers,"My two year old loves this book and quickly learned all the poses. The book has a few basic poses which are renamed for the animal they mimic. For example, ""standing forward bend"" is renamed ""monkey"" because the pose resembles a monkey bending over. The illustrations and text are simple and the back of the book has photos of actual children doing the poses along with some parental tips. It's a great book and I highly recommend it. It's also a great gift idea for a young child whose mom practices yoga."
4,Good tools for the money!,"Having owned almost every major brand of tool out there I am very impressed with the current line of tools from SK. While I would not necessarily consider this a Senior Mechanics Set - I would consider it a very good starting place for a person starting out to be a serious mechanic. There are many specialty tools not included in this, and a variety of redundant tools are also not present. However considering the price, the quality, and what is included, a person could do a lot worse than choosing this set to build upon."
3,"meh, last one was better","We can all agree that The War of Art was far more superior than this one. A little more than half the tracks are very good, but not great. I think they lost a member or 2 which sort of altered their performance. This album is not as ""in your face"", innovative,and loud as their previous, but over all a solid cd. A must have for any AHC fan and also fans of dry kill logic, spineshank, and bloodsimple fans."
2,What happened?,"Besides a couple of songs on here, this album was a dissapointment. I really liked TWOA, but this one just doesn't seem to match up to that. Seems like The Charge is adding themselves to the list of one-album wonders. Oh, and this band is NOTHING like Lamb of God. They don't compare."
4,AMERICAN HEAD CHARGE..... IS AWSOME,American Head Charge... wow there new cd is very different .but Still very cool ... there live performance is so awsome...my favorite songs are ..TO.BE.ME..FIEND...LOYALTY...RIDICULEi give the cd 4 stars because it wasnt perfect. but NOT to many cds are. for those of you who dont like it thats fine because i look forward to bein in the moshpit with the true fans anyway.\m/ \m/
2,It's been a month and it still has not shipped out.,never shipped. I ordered this before Christmas. They said it was in stock. WHERE IS IT?
2,Blah.,"Although it's nice to hear something different than mallcore, this is not where you should be turning. American Head Charge succumbs to the sophmore jinx and turns out a below-average album, even for the new/nu-metal genre. Save your money and pop for the new Priest, Soilwork and Black Label when they come out. This album should be dropped in the discount bin right off the bat.Not to say there aren't some decent songs... Loyalty, Ridicule and Take What I've taken are decent, but 3 out of 11 tracks is pretty shoddy work. They don't even step above other newer nu-metalers out there, as release such as Flaw's ""Endangered Species"" are far superior to this.Come on, fellows, you've had enough time... make a good effort."
5,BEST ALBUM SO FAR IN 2005!!!,"""THE FEEDING"" is AHC's sophomore album... I gave this album a 5 because it is a very very solid album that's why it has 11 tracks... VERY HEAVY AND AT TIMES IT'S ALSO VERY MELODIC... so far this is the best album that I've heard in 2005... stand out tracks are: LOYALTY, PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE, DIRTY, COWARDS AND ALL OTHER TRACKS... THEY ARE ALL EXCELLENT!!!! This album is a must buy... to all who haven't heard about American Head Charge, you're missing A LOT! AMERICAN HEAD CHARGE RULES... \m/"
5,SWEET ALBUM,"This album is musically pleasing. I listen to it with my GIRLFRIEND when we drive in my car and bang out some drywall. I got her pregant to this. One could say, this album made me more fertile in my endeavors. Dare I say, this is the manliness, most testosterone filled album in the space/time continuum."
5,Great for reading or acting out by children.,"This book was sent to my workplace, which is a pizza magazine publishing company, and we adults were entranced. I plan to use this with my preschool music class as an activity, with half of the children acting as Pete and half acting as Pete's father. Should be lots of giggles all around!"
1,Hard to respect a heroine like this,"I really think Kate Angell has a great story--but I can't get past the beginning.The heroine and hero meet in a tight butt competition. She's wiggling her naked bottom in front of a roomful of men to earn money. Okay, she doesn't drop her pants completely, but I cannot admire a woman who does this.The secondary female is almost naked in a V-string and little else--and she claims to be a virgin. She may be physically but she's a tease and being a virgin does not make her a moral person.As much as I wanted to like TZ (the heroine), I keep remembering the first pages about her.Please understand--I am not a prude. I don't mind a hot read or sex scenes, but I don't like my heroines shaking their naked bodies for men in exchange for money."
1,find an old edition if similar,find an old edition of this book if the editions are similar. The cases in it are old so the law isn't really changing so if you can tolerate not being on the exact same page in class & can deal with figuring out the different pages save your money since this text is hard to follow! the notes and problems aren't helpful
2,The description for the condition of this book was misleading!,"The book actually came in severely water damaged and did not state that on the description. However I paid less than 10 dollars for it, so I guess you really do get what you pay for."
5,Heavy duty,"I bought this for a used base that came without the drill.Magnetic base drills are used to drill heavy steel when a handheld drill doesn't cut it. I use this mostly in structural steel but also in applications such as drilling truck frame rails, steel signage, guard rails, etc.I use annular cutters as opposed to solid drill bits. With hollow cutters only the outer perimeter of the drill is in contact with the steel, which reduces the horsepower needed. You can go larger than 5/8"" with annular cutters. The RPMs and other specs are pretty typical.Milwaukee tools are all heavy duty and built to last. The brushes are replaceable with easy to access screw-off caps. They sell replacement parts for every part of the tool if you ever need them, which I haven't yet after paying for this tool several times over.Hope that helps."
4,Dear Curious,"Dear Curious:The art of Pentjak Silat is a serious undertaken, however I think you will get a lot out of this video. Mr. plink is a student of Pendekar De Thouars.PUKULAN PENTJAK SILAT (video - NTSC, U.S. standard)The Devastating Fighting Art of Bukti Negara-Serakby Guru Stevan PlinckPukulan pentjak silat is one of the most brutally effective fighting methods known to man.

3,Serves you right for doing me wrong,"In his documentary SOUTH OF THE BORDER director Oliver Stone interviews several prominent leaders of South American nations. One could say Stone goes too easy on the likes of Venezuela president Hugo Chávez and other people's candidates, not asking tough questions one might expect.I say, it's about time! For decades American corporate media ""news"" has lobbed softball after softball to moneyed interests lackeys purporting to be representatives of the electorate. For once, those elected despite instead of because of those powerful forces get to have their say.See SOUTH OF THE BORDER."
4,THE SOUTH THAT WE SHOULD KNOW,THIS DVD IS A TIMELY REMINDER OF WHAT IT IS LIKE TO STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM IN YOUR COUNTRY . THE POOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLES WHO HAVE HAD THEIR WEALTH STOLEN BY THE DESCENDANTS OF CONQUERORS .
2,Stone goes off again.,"This was another example of Stone's excess. It was by and large a puff piece, with Stone offering various Bolivarian leaders a chance to give a very one sided view of things with absolutely no witnesses offered giving a contrary view. A few quick clips of some shrill talking heads was all that was offered in rebuttal. Stone was clearly only there to promote Chavez et al. I did enjoy the one president tweaking the US empire by asking for a base in the US in return for a base in his country. The hollowness of the enterprise was shown in its worshipful attitude towards Chavez as well as bringing in Raul Castro as another example of an exemplary leader. He may yet be the inadvertent hangman of the disastrous communist interlude in Cuba. Perhaps Stone could have asked about the hideous disproportion between the lack of Afro-Cubans in the Cuban Communist party compared to the population. But that would only be in a real documentary."
4,Fatima,"Jesus is alive and well in Fatima. I do believe Jesus honors His children and His Mother. Jesus can't be against Mary, or He would have committed the sin of not honoring your Mother and your Father. I believe and recommend all to open their hearts and minds to watching this video as a chance to step into the spirit world of Jesus."
5,1917 Fatima Portugal,Love the movie it was so good. It was a really good depiction of what happened back in 1917 in Fatima Portugal
5,Joshua Bell: a monster of the violin!,"Nine days ago we were exception witnesses when here in Caracas had the chance to watch this acclaimed violinist playing Tchaikovsky ` s Violin Concerto under the prestigious baton of Gustavo Dudamel. The sumptuous vibrato and the bright thrills literally loaded the Hall with this magic team.Bell reminded me to Ivry Gitlis but with major poetry , which is by itself major words, because as all of us know about the grandiloquence of that extraordinary violinist.An unforgettable concert supported by Rimski Korsakov orchestral works that culminated with an overwhelming ovation around this giant of the violin. Joshua Bell has entered into the reduced pantheon of violin's colossus.There is no doubt about it."
4,"Not stellar disc, but excellent performance by Joshua Bell.","Joshua Bell is always amazing, but the reproduction quality of this disc was not the best. The sound was a bit thin, for some reason. Still and all, an entertaining listening experience."
1,Not really ...,"I haven't really noticed any changes. When I ordered it said nothing about a recommended dose. I got it and read that it should be taken twice a day, 1-3 pills each time. I've only been taking one. That might have something to do with my lack of results. I'm always trying to save money."
4,it helped,"When I had Fibromyalgia pain, this was recommended by a Naturapathic Practitioner. It was not the only thing I took (see also Sedona Labs Corvalen) but it definitely helped. The price and availability was best through Amazon. Two books, also available through Amazon, have principles that can help with pain reduction. "" Pain Free For Life"" by Scott Brady, MDas well as ""Feelings Buried Alive never Die"" by Karol K. Truman."
3,Good cam for the $$,"Needed a new cam to replace the crappy X-10 I had. Bought this one so I could put the wide angle lense on it. It's in the carport and works great, but during the day the driveway is washed out. Much prefer the lorex Sg6117. Otherwise, works good at night, nice clear picture."
4,GREAT DANCE MUSIC,"If you liked Cybertribe's original Immortality AND you like dance music, then you will probably like this CD of remixes. Be warned, however, that most of the exotic instrumentation (ie., didgeridoo) has been downplayed here, appearing only briefly in some songs, in favor of the overpowering dance beat. I wish more of the world music influences of the original songs hadn't been lost in the mix. Overall, it's still a good Hi-NRG dance experience. One complaint, though: in songs 3 and 9, which otherwise are some of the best dance tunes on the album, there is an annoying male voice barking ""one, two, one-two-three"" in time to the beats which goes on forever. This vocalization is a complete distraction and makes me feel like I'm listening to a rude aerobics instructor intruding in on the songs. Let the beats speak for themselves! Because of this, I'm only giving 4 stars."
2,Disappointing,"How can such a good author of non- fiction come up with this? I found the book dull, contrived and slow. I got to about page 200 and had to stop."
5,Bridge-25 Ways to Compete inthe Bidding,I found this book (second Hand) to be very informative and easy to undertand. It has become my Bible for Bridge. I recommend it for intermediate players wanting to improve their playing without the expense of private lessons.
1,I payed for this item but did not receive yet - where is it?,I payed for this book but still have not received it. When will I get the book?
5,I will buy again at Amazon,Blinds were what I expected. They were very good quality and low price too. Shipping was excellent and on time.
2,"Okay, but...","the item is described as alabaster, but it is tan, not alabaster (or off-white, as I expected). I could have gotten the same thing for less at my local Lowe's, but I thought I was getting a lighter color."
1,What a piece of crap!,"The slats are crooked, and one of the blinds arrived with broken slats.Moral: you get what you pay for. I will now go to the Blinds store near me to purchase a better quality item.These are not worth the 9 bucks plus shipping."
3,mini-blinds,"great blinds, great value, mounting hardware is tedious..takes 1 hour to install the first one..then twenty minutes after you learn the method. No helpfull installation instructions..../but the low price makes up for this short-coming. I love the looks of my new blinds."
2,Siccmade Rituals,Aight frist let me say i'm a big fan of Siccmade but the production on this album is horrible. The beats are very simple and get boring very fast. There's like 1 good beat on the entire album. And as far as COS's spits on this CD they're ok but they get repitive. Ecspecially the hooks. Very repitive and get boring pretty fast. COS coulda came A LOT tighter. Hope he does on the next one. . .
5,excellent trip-hop / acid jazz,"One of the most chillest CD's you can buy. An excellent artist album by The Amalgamation Of Soundz released in 1997 on Filter/Dorado records but is now discontinued. Very hard to find, even harder to find at a decent price. Try gemm.com. Also pick up ""Part 2"" which is the followup to this released in Dec of 1997 just a few months after this CD. Pick this up if you like break beats and jazz elements fused together (heh, fusion :P)."
3,Wingless Pixie,"These dolls are beautiful! However, the wings DO NOT STAY ON..even the slightest movement pops them off! My daughter as well as myself get HIGHLY frustrated by it!!!!"
5,Thwarted is right...,"Danielle Dax, is in the words of a close friend, ""the best musician you've never heard of"". As stated before, Ms. Dax has a hard to describe style, indeed she's known for ""Daxifying"" different musical styles. This is a great collection of her earlier works, 1989's ""Blast the Human Flower"" album is not represented on this collection. Blast was suppossed to be her crossover mainstream effort, but it was mismanaged. If you like something different, this collection is for you, and if you can find it, get Blast the Human Flower to see a different side of her musical talents.Update: In spite of the fan outcry, Ms. Dax has given up her musical career to become a garden designer. Oh to live in the parallel universe where BtHF was a hit..."
3,not carbide,"This is a nice unit, but the bits are not carbide, they will dull quickly when drilling MDF. I will have to order carbide bits for my applications."
1,CD player no good,"I purchased a unit nearly exactly like this one (model number RCD039), though mine LOOKS exactly like this one. The front load CD player has never worked right from the first CD I played to my most recent attempt this morning. When I push the CD tray in, the unit makes a spinning squealing sound and only about 30% of the time recognizes my CD and begins to play it. The other 70% of the time, the unit doesn't recognize that a CD is inserted--the digital track information shows - - instead of the number of tracks on the CD. When it DOES play a CD, it often stops reading the CD after a few songs... for no apparent reason.I should have return the unit the next day, but life got busy. If you plan to use this for its radio or MP3 functions, you'll be fine. The radio works, but I haven't tried the MP3/iPod function yet. Do NOT plan to play any CDs on this machine. I'm convinced the front spring-load design is just crap.I got mine on sale for $39 and completely wasted my money."
5,TO boo_boo127,"Listen boy IT looks like you have old case, and old power supply thats why your computer is not stable.I have this card running for 4 months now and I have not seen any problems.The truth is you must get 350Watts power supply NOT 200 or 250Watts !ATI recomand MINIMUM 300Watts power supply, do some resarch."
3,ATI -Vs- Nvidia,"ATI's Hardware is better, Nvidia's Drivers are better...Save some money and go for a Nvidia card, Un-broken drivers mean better preformance.I have this card and I have a Nvidia TNT 2 Pro, The TNT card works almost as good as this one."
1,AIW9700 pro fails to work under SIS648 chipset,"CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH .. STUTTER .. BLINK CRASHCause most likely traced ""after three weeks of investigation!)- to SIS 648 chipset. This is KNOWN to cause problems. Why didn't someone tell me? New motherboard now needed.You have been warned!Did I mention CRASH?"
5,This Card Kills Any NIVIDAS Geforces 4 period!!!,"ATI has certainly delivered on all accounts with the Radeon 9700 Pro. Not only does it beat the competition in every benchmark thrown at it, but in most tests, it simply rips other cards apart. Performance is phenomenal across the board, but the R9700 Pro really shows its strength when used in high resolution gaming, especially with full-scene anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering. Using this card and a fairly fast processor, gaming at 1600 x 1200 is a reality with every current game on the market. Or,if your monitor doesn't like high resolutions, crank it down to 1024 x 768 or 1280 x 1024 and turn on the anti-aliasing and get extremely good performance as well.Worth every earned penny!"
1,"Great Specs, horrible for gaming","The specs on this Card are impressive and it shows on applications that it supports (Internet Explorer and Office in my case). But the majority of the Video Games that I was trying to play on this card freeze or have glitches, it's most probably the poor drivers ATI is notorious for.Age of Mythology didn't even run past the first frame on this video card. Unreal Tournament froze unexpectedly and randomly (it looked great while it worked) and numerous other games just didn't work properly.ATI's website has a driver which I downloaded in case my driver was outdated, and after installing it and rebooting, I couldn't see my desktop anymore! No more windows!Needless to say I switched to a GEForce Ti 4600 and there were no problems and I've never looked back.The only drawback right now is that for some reason, the ATI drivers can't be uninstalled! but they seem to be doing no harm so I'll just try to forget I ever got this monstrosity of a video card."
2,Just Speed!,"This card is very fast, but it's really can't support all games in the world.If u want to run all games (Old-<->-new) just go to Gefroce!ATI Corp is really bad, just bacause it only care about speed!for example u will see ugly text appear and strange lines."
1,good if you like to crash,"My previous card was a geforce2. No problems, but I decided I wanted something faster. So, I get an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro. Big mistake! Every game I have crashes at random places. I love Freespace 2, but now I can't play it until I get a different card. Asheron's Call 2 crashes after about a minute of play.Summary: It doesn't matter how fast a card is if it crashes constantly. Don't buy this card!"
1,ill be honest,"I have a amd athlon xp 2100, 8x agp capable motherboard, 400 watt power supply, 256mb ddr 300 ram. I got enough to make this card run great, the only problem is the my card won't run at all.. I was able to play gta 3 once at ultra high resolutions, and it ran sooo sweet. But that was only once. I talked to ati, and they told me to do a few things, make it work better. Nothing worked, so i sent it to them, they sent me a new one back. Still didn't work, it would freeze constantly just trying to start a game in unreal tournament 2k3, max payne, nhl 2003, gta3, and the list goes on. I am extremely dissappointed by the capability issues that it had. I paid 350 bucks for this card, and i haven't been able to enjoy it yet(I've had it for 6 monthes). I'm sticking to nvidia from now on. Do research before you buy any card this price."
1,Bad experience with UT2K3,"While this card outperformed my Nvidia GF3Ti500 in the new Winmark (4300 to 1112) it ran UT2K3 worse... about the same framerates but constant crashing.Worst part is telephone support for the first 30 days is on a toll line... in my case it cost me a bundle working with them for nearly 90 minutes... and their ""free"" email support is worthless... they simply send you links to white pages... which in my case I'd already gone through.Recently sent the card back and plan to upgrade to a GF4 instead."
2,Fast Card - But Poor Stability,"I have a amd athlon xp 2100+, 8x agp capable motherboard, 300 watt power supply, a battery bacup, 512mb ddr 300 ram and Windows XP Pro. Before getting this card, I had a NVidia GeForce 3, which although not the fastest card, it was at least STABLE, not a single crash. With the ATI 9700, I have had nothing but problems, especially with UT2K3 and Morrowind. There are two types of crashes that occur frequently:1 - the game just crashes and exits back to the Desktop.OR2 - the system reboots in the middle of a game.I have the latest drivers, but I suspect in this case that the card is overheating. I will acknowledge however, that the card is by far the fastest I ever seen, but I would never sacrifice stability for performance."
2,Software does not work well,"This software has a lot of issues.First it freeze all the time. Then you have to close it and restart.Second the typing is not natural. For some reason when you reach a word at the end of a line you aren't supposed to put a space after it (which is what anyone naturally does). Then you get an error for each line.Annoying, dumb software."
4,Great new color GPS receiver,"See my review for this receiver under Lowrance ifinder Expedition C Plus, which is the same receiver with the 6 MapCreate CDs and card reader included. The Plus package is a very good deal if you're interested in having detailed topographic map information on your receiver. The non-Plus unit just comes with basic low detail built-in map that's not too useful.The Lowrance ifinder Expedition C has a built-in compass, color screen, an easy and advanced mode, many user adjusted options, and uses small SD memory cards.GPS satellite is fast and strong; it even works inside my house! Battery life seems somewhat short, but overall I'm impressed."
1,Very good for 3 years - then expensive paperweight,"Bottom line: Steer clear if you expect a piece of equipment that lasts more than three years.I'd have given this a four-star rating up until a month ago. That's when it passed its third anniversary of use. And stopped finding its location. It'll operate absolutely normally in every regard; displaying maps, finding satellites and positioning them in the sky; compass works; barometer works; in short it will do everything except its primary function.Lowrance customer service has been notably unresponsive except to finally tell me that they want $150 just to look at it.Some internet surfing reveals that this is an epidemic with this model and similar Lowrance models. They simply go belly-up in this fashion after three years. My personal suspicion, unsubstantiated in any way, is that they are programmed to cease their primary function after three years since turn-on.Anyway, now I have to get another GPS for hunting, and it won't be a Lowrance."
2,buyer beware,"My iFinder worked great for three years until stopped it locating satellites. I went to test it before a outing and it could not locate any satellites. I have taken great care of my GPS, always careful w/ it and never dropping it. Called customer service and they want $149 flat fee to fix it plus $12.50 for shipping. Hopefully they have or will make there new GPS's last longer."
5,i HATE hip hop. I love HERBALISER!~,"most hip hop seems rather recycled and bland. this is not hip hop either, yet elements are very present. I purchased this album after seeing them live (something everybody should do, my what a great show...! )all of the guest vocalists (mc's)> GREAT! all of the wacky sampling > GREAT! all of Ollie's scratchinG > GREAT!~shattered soul= classic epic, beauty! my personal favourite track."
5,Blistering Western adventure from Ralph Cotton,"How Arizona Ranger Sam Burrack first met series semi-regular Sheriff Boyd Tackett. Tracking a 12 year old girl abducted by one of the less stable members of a band of vicious scalp hunters. What can I say, action, suspense, the reclamation of lost honor, dark humor and a rogues gallery of villians. Adventure in Ralph Cotton's own special style."
1,Garbage!,"Kivel's theories are total nonsense. He draws parallels between all manners of normal masculine behavior and the topic of violence. ""Have you ever stared at a woman's breasts while talking to her?"" He asks. ""Have you ever worked out to make yourself look tougher?"" He asks. Is this supposed to make us feel guilty about being men? How do these things make us ""violent."" This book advocates the feminist-inspired psychological castration of men. I have a few questions. Women: Have you ever looked at a man's pec's? Have you ever tried to look prettier in order to impress a richer man?This book is a pro-feminist piece of garbage. I was forced to read this book in college and it is as inflamatory as it is inaccurate."
5,Fantastic Bible Stories,This is an excellent way to share the bible with a child. The stories are great and the pictures wonderful. The lessons and prayer at the end are easy for even a young child.It is a great way to end the day together.
4,Sleep book for young children,"What a good book for younger children (my granddaughter is 4) to help them get in a peaceful frame of mind for sleep! The little firefly, ""Nightlight"" repeats the same format in every story (quiz time, prayer, then sleep). Good stories and illustrations, only disagreement is sometimes showing a more cartoon format for pictures of Christ."
3,a little too simplified,"I bought this to read to my four year old at bed time. This book is a little overly simplified for my liking. I feel like they left out key details, that would not have been too much information for children."
5,Wonderful...,"This book has been a great blessing to us. We use it as a birthday gift etc whenever possible. It has always engaged the interest of our son, even though we have gone through the whole book at least three times. In fact he likes it so much that he remembers much of the content...what more could you want...!!"
3,some pages were missing,Even though half the pages were missing I was still happy to get it as I will be using these as postcards to send to friends. It was a good value even with the missing pages.
3,If the author were not so self absorded and pretencious....,"I would have given this book four stars. Every few pages there is a giant side note from celebraties praising the author... and most of them time, it has little related to fashion. It was hard to ignore this since it occured so often. Annoying, to say the least. I was, however, quite please with the rest of the book, despite her stale sense of humor. She did give some good fashion advice, that's undeniable."
1,Book is content free....,"After reading all the great pre-release press, I assumed this book would be full of useful and new ideas. Wrong. While the author sounds like someone you'd love to have for a friend and shopping buddy, the book itself is largely content free."
2,A Fashion Therapist?,"This book is a REPRINT, so it was originalywritten in a completely different fashion time.The fashion clothes and tips in this book wereextremely outdated. Betty Halbreich is an elderso she really doesn't give fashion advice thatwould fit for someone that is under the age of 30."
1,Casssini not available,"Very good product, excellent aroma, but after my order was received and paid for they came back and said it was not available, very frustrating."
1,NOT the ORIGINAL,"actually it is a waste of money , It is the same bottle , same shape, but not the same quality as the original cassiniI think the company stops the original products so please avoid buy these perfumes ,Because it is not the same like the old days"
5,Cabbage and Ladybug night light,This is a gorgeous night light looks beautiful at my kitchen counter.The material it is made from is very sturdy and made to last it is not flimsy or delicate.Very much worth the money when beauty in your nightlight is important.
1,There is a credibility problem here,"When I buy a book on Europe (a continent) I don't expect to find sections on Ireland, England or Iceland which are on Islands in the North Atlantic.Maybe the book should be titled:How to Europe, with England, Ireland and Iceland but we missed Scotland and Wales.Well at least he got the Scotland and Wales part right"
2,Fans Only,"Okay, here's the deal. If you are a Poppy Brite fan then you will devour this book. If you are new to Poppy then skip this one. There is a very fine line in horror between scary and gross. This book is disgusting simply for the joy of being so. It requires a strong stomach and a brain chemistry that defies nightmares. In other words, sensitive or very young folks should leave this one alone."
5,Brava!,"Of course gore and perversion skillfully described in prose by a writer with good imagination and a good command of her mother-tongue disturbs the prudish and the fearful. This is exactly what Brite achieves in this novel, drawing forth derision and complaint from those who should have known this novel was not for them but for those who will examine their own proclaimed lack of darkness when the extreme images that remain in their minds."
2,Hmmmm,"Well, I really wanted to love this novel. It seemed just my kind of thing when I read the editorial reviews. But I was deeply disappointed. All I can see is that this book was so busy kissing its own well-made-up, taut, goth buttocks it had not time for characterizaiton. There are some very interesting beginnings here (hence two rather than one star) but I never find the characters particularly plausible. The exception is Lucas, who leaps of the page real and fully formed, until the very end of the book where he stalls quite suddenly and falls into an inaction quite out of time with the rest of his persona.Brite's prose is good and it's a very readable book, but motivations weren't clear and depth of personality of characters lacked. There are more interesting 'mind of a killer' novels out there."
1,Disgusting book,"I read Lost Souls.. and *tried* to read this book. It made me feel sick, and couldn't finish it to save my life. The detail it went into about murder is disturbing. I discourage anyone from reading it as it is pretty nasty, vile book."
1,It's not that I don't like blood....,"I have never read any Poppy Z. Brite before, and was extremely disappointed in this. I just had this vision in my head of some goth girl sitting on her bed under her dyed-black mosquito net and thinking..""Oh, yeah, that's good..I'll make them gay, yeah, and I'll throw some club kids in,and some sharp knives, and while I'm at it, why don't I just mention a lot of really cool goth bands..."" I think Poppy Z. Brite read ""Interview with the Vampire"" and then Caleb Carr's ""The Alienist"" and simply morphed the two ideas into this practically unreadable dross."
5,Only for some people,"I agree with the reader from New Jersey. If you couldn't handle this book then read Dr. Seuss. All the close-minded people out there should read nice little books that take no risks and hide from the real world. Okay, this book did have some vivid murder scenes, but that's what made it so beautiful. Poppy Z. Brite didn't play it safe and leave out parts that some people take offense to. She left them in and it made the statement that she's not scared to push her writing to the extreme. I hope she does the same in her next book."
3,Brite's recent works seem to be losing their unique edge.,"It seems that in Brite's recent attempts, she has had to veer into more grotesque and blatantly shocking prose in order to attract an aufience. While she writes for those people who enjoy a bit of decadence now and then, when delicately laced through a work, she appears to have resorted to the use of baser material--especially in Exquisite Corpse. While I am an avid reader of her work, I have come to sense that it's quality is on its decent. The characters did not beceome as real or believable as they have in the past, as in Lost Souls. While I would recommend Exquisite Corpse, I would not recommend it highly, and hope that Brite will return to her roots with her extraordinary, seductively daring style."
3,"Gory, entertaining but a little weak for PZB","I have read everything Poppy Z. Brite has published and was hyped when Exquisite Corpse came out. I was completely enthralled with Andrew Compton. His whole story was like a ""true crime"" stoy and I loved that! The AIDS awareness was done well I thought, but maybe slightly over kill. No pun intended. Although I tried I could not conjure feelings for ill fated Tran, however. And I thought the end was a bit of a let down as I wanted Something Big to happen. But it also left it open to your imagination as to how anyone could go on after something this horrific happening to them, around them or to someone they loved. I recomend this book to steadfast fans of Poppy Z. Brite, but I would not offer it to a friend as I do not feel it is her best work. LostSouls and Drawing Blood are at the top of that list."
4,Not for everyone.,"I won't be reading any other Brite books soon. I am impressed with her literary voice, if not the subject matter. It is gruesome, gory, sad, pathetic and shocking. I am glad to have read this, not for the story, but for Brite's poetic voice and character development."
3,unique,"Brite has a really good plotline, even if it's a bit unbelievable at times. The detailing is done really well and the ending is refreshingly unexpected, avoiding every cliche thet seems to be hitting paperback thrillers lately. Her characters and their motivation is truly believable, as you find yourself sympathizing with the lovers when they go out looking for meals and can't find sutible prey. If you are going for graphic, this is the book for you. The scenes of dismemberment are so exact they'll bring tears to an anatomists, or even a butchers eyes. It was a little to much in places for me, and several people I lent the book to put it down within the first few chapters."
4,I'd give it a 10 if i was gay.,"This is my first exposure to Poppy's novels, i enjoy her short fiction immensley. It seems to me however that if she wishes to continue to write novels, she might want to enter into the gay porno genre... The four and five page descriptions of sex do nothing but bog down an otherwise interesting and compelling work of horror fiction. She does quite well with devel;opment of unusual characters who come from obscure backgrounds and the seemingly wild nightlife of New Orleans. The twisted love triangle that forms is quite interesting. Well worth the read if you can wade through the annoying sex scenes."
4,Descriptions So Good You Can Taste the Wall Paper!,"The horror genre has a new Queen of detail in the writings of Poppy Z. Brite. In Brite's latest novel, Exquisite Corpse, we sit back for a ride through the lives of two serial killers who find each other and fall in love. From the scinitilating minds of both serial killers, to the vivid depiction of the New Orleans most of us never see Brite's novel is captivating. While not for the light of heart this book brings Goth Horror to new heights. I enjoyed Brite's ability to create a story where you never thought you would find one. Brite's characters draw you in, her writing style keeps you, and her details and descriptions leave you begging for more."
1,Big Disappointment!,"Overwritten, overpraised. Why this has received so much praise from people who consider themselves intelligent is a mystery. Do any horror readers go to college anymore?"
2,Poppy should just take up writing gay porn full time...,"...since it seems like that's what she's most interested in. DRAWING BLOOD started off promising till it turned into an endless series of sex adventures between the two main characters. Um, could we get back to the *story*, please?Well, EXQUISITE CORPSE is even worse. You can't go five pages without one of the characters fantasizing about how he'd love to do one of the others up the rear. Once again Poppy abandons her story for a lot of homoerotic fantasy that does nothing but bog the book down and take up space. Such tedium along with a cast of entirely unlikeable characters (another of the author's weaknesses) made the book nearly unreadable for me.I really liked LOST SOULS a lot and I thought I'd give Brite another chance after being disappointed by her second novel, but I think this is it for me."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"Alright, I have read numerous books and stories by Poppy Z. Brite, but I was NEVER more disgusted. This book is terrible, tasteless, bland and just plain gross. I was really let down and it really was a waste of money."
1,For Brave Readers,"I had heard of her work and decided to read this book. I regretted it. It was too graphic, with regards to the homosexual relationship and necrophilia for me, that I decided to stop about half-way through. To prove to myself that I could get through it, I decided to finish it. I immediately threw it away, when finished. I was embarrassed to tell anyone that I read it, nor have I recommended it. I did not like being in the mind of these people!"
3,It's been a while,"I read this book when I was a punk-gothic teenager full of angst and rebellion. Now I'm a mother, a career woman, and I remember very little about this book. I do remember one thing though, Lost Souls and Drawing Blood were so amazing, and Exquisite just made me squirm."
3,Pulp and not really anything else...,"Exquisite Corpse brought out contradicting feelings in me. It has all the same qualities that endear me to trashy exploitation films: despicable characters, buckets of gore and trashy sex. Every turn of the page I imagined what a wonderfully trashy movie this would make, but sadly, I could not feel that way about the novel itself.While the descriptions of murder and carnage were truly disgusting, it seemed Poppy had attempted to meld this with a central theme that mired itself in the constant viewpoint shifting of its central characters. Also, the end felt rushed and I did not feel that the relationship between Jay and Andrew was fully explored.In spite of all this, the book was a quick and fun read. It was just little more visceral than I had expected. This was my first book by Poppy, but I will definitely be checking out her other work soon."
4,Brite homophobic?,"...""Exquisite Corpse"" WAS extremely graphic and stomach-turning, I can't add much to what everyone else said about it...but it is still Poppy and therefore still unforgettable and impossible to put down. It can horrify even the most jaded horror fan (as proven by my friend who begged to borrow it and couldn't even finish it, because she thought it was too disturbing.)"
5,Kept me Reading,"I've read this book about 5 or 6 times already and everytime I pick up a little detail that I missed that last time I read it and the ending never gets old it's always a good book no matter how many times you read it. The fully detailed sentences jusy keeps you locked it and you don't want to put the book down, she's a phenomenal writer and she should be recognized for it."
5,Don't Close Your Eyes...,Try curling up at bedtime and reading the fascinating horrific detail of this grisly tale. Poppy will make your skin crawl with her darkest novel yet. Exquisite Corpse is written in stark detail... that puts you directly in the path and mind of a serial killer with a penchant for young sweet boys. One of those books that makes you want to leave the light on and travel with one eye over your shoulder.
1,Dark in a Bad Way,"Though I am a big fan of many dark films and movies, I usually like for them to have some sort of moral, lesson or hope to impart. Most of them do. This book is darkness for darkness sake, extremely gross and sadistic, and beyond disturbing. Though well written, I thought it was a waste of time and offered nothing but horrific visions and bleakness. I was so upset by this book, I wanted to write the author, but naturally, she has no public email or way of contacting. I really think she should be hanging her head in shame for contributing garbage like this to the world. I am no prude, extremely liberal and my favorite movie is The Crow, which is quite dark itself. But while that film is about love and redemption, this book is about terrible things. The world doesn't need this kind of darkness."
2,Disappointing and Disgusting,"The story starts off great with a fast paced escape of one of the main characters. At times there were some well-written dramatic scenes, but too often the book descends into describing gay sex in graphic detail to a degree that approaches gay porn. For many (if not most) straight people, you will likely find yourself sickened, for the sex acts described were as disturbing to me as the murders. I think she went a little too far in this regard, although it will certainly make her more popular in the gay community.That having been said, the girl can sure write. I just hope she picks better subjects in the future."
3,Tres Interessant.,"As many others have said, you cannot unread Poppy Z. Brite. I would not recommend this book to rather immature people, seeing that the subject manner is quite disturbing. I wasn't at all irked by Lost Souls or Drawing Blood, but this one really got me.The characters are interestingly developed, but you don't feel the same compassion for them as you might have with Steve and Ghost/ Trevor and Zach. Andrew Compton and Jay Byrne were very interesting characters. . . it was fun to look inside the mind of a serial killer for a bit.The thing that I really didn't appreciate was all of the gore. Was it really so necessary? Could a creepier story have resulted from less blood? Perhaps.Again, this book is one that you could never forget. Tread lightly on the subject matter (and don't read it right before going to bed) and you shall be fine."
2,Disappointed,"My one-line summary says everything. I had a general feeling that she was going in for shock-value, trying to get her readers to gag. It seemed that that was the single purpose of the book. Her ending to the story was a cop-out. She really should have developed her characters more, they were hollow and did not feel real. The way that Jay and Andrew met was...to be blunt...unbelievable. It was a ""hello, I'm a psycho-killer."" type meeting. All I can say is that she needed to expand on her characters, cut back on surrounding descriptions, and make the plot more believable. Maybe then I would have gaged. :Sonja"
5,Disturbingly fantastic,"I wasn't sure at first if words could describe my feelings about this book. However, I'll do my best.Exquisite Corpse was recommended to me by a friend. I bought the book without hesitation and set to reading it. I was extremely surprised by how well-written it was. It sucked me in with the first few paragraphs and didn't let me go until I reached the final page. I'm more than happy that I picked this book up.Of course, it's a depraved story that will make those with a weak stomach cringe. But that's what makes it so terrifying and wonderful. It touches upon the dark parts of human nature, the parts that are so fascinating to read about. Poppy Z. Brite wrote her characters with such care and concern that they invade your mind and stay with you even after their story ends.I. loved. this. book."
3,Art imitating life?,"This was the first Brite novel I read. Many times I had heard her compared to Anne Rice, after reading this book the only comparison I would dare make about the two author's is the New Orleans connection. While this novel wasn't the worst I had ever read it certainly was one of the most disturbing, the author re-wrote a dark chapter in the life of Dharma and added a sick side kick. I felt she trivialized the horror of being murdered and suggested that the victims of Dharma and other serial killers actually enjoyed being murdered. Overall, this novel is not very original as it is a fictional rendition of Dharma."
4,Decent Story - Needs an Editor,"This one came recommended from some of the Kindle forums. I must admit that I was intrigued by the subject matter - Not every day you hear about a book dealing with Necrophiliacs and Cannibals, especially when they are sometimes likeable characters.The story was entertaining over all but in TERRIBLE need of an editor for the Kindle edition. There were multiple translation errors (for example, the name ""Tran"" was typed out as ""Iran"" in at least 5 places), grammar errors, unneccessary commas, and several misspellings. Not sure how Amazon gets books onto the Kindle but it appears that the system needs some reworking. The mistakes are distracting at best and I found myself on edge, sometimes more in anticipation of the next grammatical error than the next plot twist.Over all, an entertaining read, not for the weak-stomached. Rambling at times but fairly even-paced."
5,Gore and More...,"'Exquisite Corpse' is a 'on-the-edge-of-your-seat' reading. Based around the mishaps and lifestyle of a wealthy, homosexual sadist, Poppy Z. Brite offers a book littered with such violent and detailed masochistic imagery, I was afraid to turn out the light at night, for fear I might meet one of the main characters in the darkness.A powerful story, many of the characters in the book are destined from the beginning to meet a grisly end - it is so interesting to find out how, though.I would definitely recommend this book to the darker half of literature-lovers, as I loved it from beginning to end and it continues to rate highly amongst my favourite pieces of 21st century writings."
5,darkly beautiful,"This was one of the most eerily beautiful books I've ever read. Brite knows her strong points and she uses them well. It might not please everyone, but it certainly pleased me. The characters were wonderful (especially Tran) and of all of her novels, this would be the one I would enjoy seeing made into a film. Even if the book is always better than the movie."
4,"Under the radar, Flying fisherman makes excellent sunglasses","This is my 3rd pair/style from FF. I've spent upto $100 on sunglasses before, and I'm amazed that $20-30 sunglasses from FF are as good and better. Sporty, good fit, no slippage, light, no distortion, no awkward coloration looking out.These fit my face really well, although they seem narrow (width) on even my angular face. So if you have a thin face, or are female, these will be perfect. For mid to large faces, these look a little small."
5,Looks Great!,This box looks great and is definitely a great way to add storage and style to your closest. On the downside they are not very big and can only hold about 2-3 sweaters at a time depending on the thickness of each sweater. A nice feature about them is you don't have to worry about opening the whole box to get out your sweaters because of a side flap that is secured with velcro. Because of this I was able to stack them on top of each other and don't have to worry about un-stacking them to get my stuff out. Overall I would say it was a great buy.
5,I really like this stuff,"I've been shying away from the ultra loaded stimulant driven diet pills so I decided to try this. I am really really shocked at how much I like this. I haven't found a diet pill yet that has worked for me until I gave this a try. It seems to be the perfect balance for my body. I've lost 7 pounds in two weeks with diet and moderate excercise. It's a perfect boost of energy and my appetite cravings have greatly diminished. I feel full much faster, so I eat half and have hardly any snack cravings. If I do snack I actually feel satisfied with sweet grapes, apples, nectarines etc., instead of refined sugars. All I can say is that it's worked for me, so I will continue using it."
2,If it sounds too good to be true...,"First let me say, I did not actually take this product. I did however buy this product. It promises to help you lose 20 pounds in 6 weeks by following their diet and exercise program while taking their product. I read the literature before I opened the bottle. Their exercise program is light and doable. Their two week diet is a South Beach Diet, verbatim! Considering I lost 12 lbs the first two weeks on South Beach and around 18 total for the first 6 weeks, I don't see where this product will do anything for you. I would have given it 1 star, but since I didn't actually take the product, I couldn't in good conscience."
4,a nonobjective treatise,"...tick tick tick.....this is Turgenev's Fathers and Sons written after the modernist floodgates had been opened. My version of this has a Kandinsky on the cover and that is the perfect emblem to front this Russian avante garde revolution of a book. There is in it a live time bomb waiting to go off. It takes awhile to get used to Biely's unusual way with words(and I have no idea if this is a translation thing or not) but once you catch his rhythms it is a great read. We live in a much more settled civilization than the one this author experienced and documents but if you like to read things that remind you that culture occasionally does undergo monumental shifts, this is one of those works. Not perfection to our postmodernist ears but strange music indeed. Boom."
5,Nabokov's opinion,"10 15 99According to a review in Smithsonian, March 1987, by Michael Dirda, Nabokov called Biely's St. Petersburg the greatest Russian novel of the 20th century."
4,Almost perfect,"The wheels don't really snap into place so if you are carrying it somewhere or going up a ladder they can slip off pretty easy. I adhered mine down after the wife took the accessory bin to the face. Other then that, this is hands down the best wet/dry vac I've used and I've tried 2 dozenish."
2,Poor image quality,"The price is good, but the image quality is poor. The images are very dark under indoor light, and if the low-light option is clicked in the driver, then the images are bright but the camera suffers from extreme motion blur that makes it unusable. I compared this to the old 3com HomeConnect (only USB 1 and now discontinued) which was remarkably better under all lighting conditions.For outdoor use, this camera may be fine. The focus ring is hard to use, but only needs to be set once for outdoor use. The little tripod is nice. The driver software has problems, such as not remembering image size settings."
2,"Poor low-light performance, limited picture sizes","Lousy camera, period. It installed okay on a Win2000 anda WinXP machine, but unless you have very bright light on the camera, the image is way too dark. If you enable the ""low light"" feature, or turn up the brightness control, the image brightens up, but the framerate drops to about 10-12 frames per second. If you want decent live-capture video at 30 fps, forget it.Once in a while, it mysteriously ""disappears"" as an available video capture device on a WinXP machine, and I have to reboot to get it back.Can only capture 160x120, 320x240, or 640x480 sizes. You really need 352x288 for videoconferencing.Compare this to a Logitech Quickcam Pro 4000 and you'll see there is no comparison. The Logitech is better in every conceivable way."
1,disappointing,"I was so excited to receive my package only to be disappointed and frustrated with the installation. The company clearly stated it was compatible with Windows XP on the package box however, during installation ,I got a warning from Microsoft that this product was not checked for compatibility with my system (Windows XP).I installed it anyway but then found that the networking software is not compatible with my system (again!)I'm not very computer literate therefore the whole process was a waste of my time. I returned it right away."
5,Should be required reading in order to be a band manager!,"Well, we had a band manager a few months ago that was absolutely worthless. After we fired him, I decided to manage and promote my band myself. I picked up this book, followed it's examples, and now we're touring outside of the state. Take that, Mike McGowen!"
1,Either scam or frame,"I want to join in what the other one star reviews said. It looks so review-fake, it's either a scam or somebody else is trying to frame him or her.Anybody that promises Amway-like miracles like $ Furtune $ should not be taken seriously. Music is about harmony and art and not about how to make it big and rich. That is looking at music the wrong way, from the wrong end. This cannot be a good book. If you are in it for the $$$ in ANY business (especially in art) you are in it for the wrong reason. Make beautiful music because you love music and the money may just come all by itself."
4,Moon Series,"I've been enjoying the Moon Series.Fulton's novels are refeshing and a new spin on each of them, even though the main characters (Cody and Annabel) remain the same.A novel to take you mind off your troubles. Take this one to the beach with you."
4,The Water Horse - Legend of the Deep,"An enchanting tale of friendship and evolving relationships. A winning family film, a solidly made wish-fulfillment fantasy."
4,crackling good old fashioned smart family film,"the cast is great , the script smart and the director clued in to what makes a better than average family film tick . at first i balked when i saw some stuff early in the film . i began to recognize the excellent cast from other adult pictures my wife and i have in our libraries or had seen . it may be gradual for you (as with me) or swift as was the case with my wife , but chances are this story will lure you in . it's one of those smart pictures where no one is superficial or one dimensional . as the characters are fleshed out , so come the charms . if you give it a real chance i think you'll feel pretty satisfied and happy . those are nice things to come by ."
5,Best Lock Ness Movie Ever,Very children friendly and well done. The water horse looks absolutely real and the scenes were outstanding. Highly recommend for any age.
4,"Very Nice, Kids Loved it","Product came fast and in good condition.Great family movie. Good actors, very good story and very good special effects.The kids love this in Blue Ray and watch it at least once a week."
4,My daughter's favorite,"My daughter is 8 and loves this movie. She has watched it many times. She also watches the ""making of"" and special effects extras. It's almost nothing like the book. It's better."
2,NOT SO GOOD.........,Purchased this for my 3 granddaughters (ages 8 and two 5 yr olds). It did not hold their interest or mine. Disappointing!
1,What happened to the girl ?,"In the book the main character is the sister. The change to a boy was not lost on my 10-year-old daughter, who lost interest in seeing the movie once she figured out from the previews that the sister lost out on the story. I don't see any reason for the big change - did they think no one would have actually read the book ?"
1,The Kid Should Have gotten The Bends!,"I haven't been able to watch the entire movie, it goes through long spells of people in war tiem doing something. Can't hang around long enough to care. Maybe the budget was short and they could only do a little story about the Waterhorse and then plump out the movie with the people parts. ZZZzzzzzzzzz......On the plus side, the cinematography was phenomenal, the music score ditto, the FX on the Waterhorse likewise. But why didn't the kid get the bends when the Waterhorse took him down very deep, very fast and brought him up even faster? At least his eardrums should have exploded. And the boy's red, red McCauley Culkin lips creeped me out!"
5,Water Horse,"This is a fabulous venture into fantasy. The Water Horse is a great example of the depths of love a child has for any creature, even one that is most unusual. It is good viewing for the whole family."
5,Awesome family movie!,"Wow! Fastest shipping ever, especially since I ordered it around Christmas. This is a great family movie for people of all ages! Kids under 3 may not follow the flashbacks, but the water horse himself is a fabulously animated creature you just cannot help but love. Very heartwarming that movies like this still exist!"
5,The Water Horse - Legend of the Deep,"What a fun movie. I highly recommend this to all who have a love for ""feel good"" fantasy."
3,I want a Water Horse!,That's what you'll think everytime the little (then BIG) Dickens is on the screen. When he is not the focus of the story it drifts off into stupidity and BOREDOM. The whole house occupation (in SCOTLAND?) is just so stupid. Maybe if you skip chapters ...
5,The Water Horse,I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I thought it was very moving and would recommend it to anyone.
3,"Cute, Life-like special effects + Lack of touching moment = Worth renting.","The special effects of this movie are worth 5 stars. The water horse looks so real and cute that I want to touch it. The problem is there is no touching moment compared to other kids' films. ""The two brothers"" is more heart-wrenching and as beautiful as this one. I don't know why. Is it because of the directing or acting? The plot is typical of any family movie.It's worth renting."
5,Amazing!,"I loved the movie. It came in great condition! I expected to only get the movie, but it was the ""Target exclusive"" edition, a disc with special features and a disc with The History Channel's program Loch Ness: Great Monster Mystery. It could have been who I bought it through, but I couldn't be happier about a purchase!"
3,Great for the age group it is aimed at,"We sent this DVD to our nieces and nephews. My 8 year old nephew liked it the best. Not surprising. The story seems to go at a pace that suits the kids although adults might find it a bit simplistic. It is a clean, entertaining movie for kids and we are pleased with the purchase."
4,Much better than one would expect,"The scenery and music in this film are stunning, for one thing. The quality of the blu-ray is quite high with only a few visual inconsistencies. The story is moving and deep, and for me it's much more than the history of the Loch Ness monster. It deals with war, orphans, scepticism and myth. I had heard negative things about this movie and I'm glad that I decided to take advantage of the low price for the blu-ray and get me a copy. I can say that I quite enjoyed the film and I will be watching it again in the future. It is much better than expected so don't pay too much attention to the negative criticism thrown at it."
2,Watery and weak,"I didn't feel that Crusoe (the waterhorse) was the main character of this movie. He felt very incidental through a lot of it. Like he was there just to play a bit part so the real main characters could have epiphanies. Which is sad, because he and Churchill (the dog) had more personality than most of the human cast!I will say that this movie was far sadder and more depressing than I would have imagined. Those looking for feel-good Disney fluff should turn away now. There's not a whole lot of happy in this movie. It has a very dark, depressing feel to it despite some of the more lighthearted moments (mostly starring Crusoe and Churchill). The ending was oh so predictable, leaving me with a 'why did I bother' sort of feeling. In fact, the movie as a whole left me flat. The only highlight is that Crusoe really was adorable as a young creature (not so much when he grew up)."
